CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in Number 99-9073, Paula Buford v. The United States.
Mr. Strang.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEAN A. STRANG

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9
10

MR. STRANG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Paula Buford's case presents the very type of

11

mixed question well-suited to de novo review, and that's

12

particularly true here because of the overriding, indeed

13

the pervasive importance of uniformity in the current

14

Federal sentencing scheme.

15

Paula Buford serves a prison sentence roughly

16

twice as long as it would have been because of the way in

17

which the district court interpreted and applied

18

guidelines and commentary on relatedness and

19

consolidation.

20

Seventh Circuit erred by declining to give independent

21

review to the question of consolidation incorporated into

22

the meaning of relatedness, specifically declined to

23

review de novo whether her prior convictions, her prior

24

cases in fact had been consolidated.

25

In her view, the Court of Appeals of the

I think there are several specific reasons that
3

1

make this an appropriate case, an appropriate mixed

2

question application of the guidelines --

3

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Strang, isn't there one,

4

perhaps, factor that cuts against your argument the fact

5

that district courts probably see this kind of case --

6

kind of an argument in connection with sentencing, a

7

typical district judge, much more often than a typical

8

judge of a court of appeals?

9

MR. STRANG:

It is true, Your -- Mr. Chief

10

Justice that but a fraction of sentences ever are appealed

11

on any ground, but there is no reason to assume that the

12

district judge would be reviewing the act of a State court

13

in his own district or her own district or of any court

14

familiar to that district judge.

15

convictions here arose in Milwaukee County, the seat of

16

the Eastern District of Wisconsin, I think is fairly

17

described an accident.

18
19

QUESTION:

The fact that the prior

That's where the Federal judge sits,

is it not?

20

MR. STRANG:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. STRANG:

Yes.
In Milwaukee County?
Yes, and that's an accident of the

23

facts here.

There's no reason that Ms. Buford's prior

24

convictions could not have arisen in Tuscaloosa, Alabama,

25

or San Fernando, California -4

1

QUESTION:

Let me ask you another question.

I

2

guess that the guidelines provide that sentences are

3

related where the offenses occurred on the same occasion,

4

or were part of a common scheme or plan, and those

5

questions seem to involve certain factual determinations.

6

Do you think that on appellate review there would be a de

7

novo review?

8
9

MR. STRANG:

Never of historical facts,

regardless which path one takes to relatedness.

The

10

basic, or what this Court has called historical facts,

11

would be subject only to clear error review.

12
13

QUESTION:

How about mixed questions of fact and

law?

14

MR. STRANG:

The particular mixed question of

15

consolidation, which is the third prong of the definition

16

here, yes.

17

QUESTION:

Well, in the example that I gave you

18

of common scheme or plan there might be mixed questions of

19

fact or law, and would there be de novo review there?

20

MR. STRANG:

There may well be mixed questions,

21

and I think the common scheme or plan is the application

22

here that next to consolidation most calls or most invites

23

de novo review.

24

intervening arrest, which is the initial screening device

25

in the definition under the application note, I think that

If we look at the question of an

5

1

one is most factual, that an intervening arrest rarely, if

2

ever, would arise beyond fact, it seems to me.

3

QUESTION:

I mean, technically I think you're

4

right in saying the words which come out of an application

5

note in a guideline about, that you could deem a thing

6

consolidated when it's -- what is the exact word? -- when

7

it's functionally consolidated, when it's -- you know,

8

what are the words I'm thinking of, functionally

9

consolidated when the cases -- when sentencing was joined,

10
11

okay.
Now you want to know -- this is somebody writing

12

an application note in the guideline, and logically

13

speaking nobody's disputing the brute facts.

14

disputing whether sentencing was joined, those words,

15

sentencing was joined, do or do not apply to this

16

undisputed factual situation in the world, so if you're

17

going to go on a, all legal questions are for the court,

18

and the court of appeals, all factual questions are for

19

the trial judge, and this is a legal question, in that

20

rubric I guess you win.

21

They're

But I would have thought that there were

22

millions of legal questions of this kind that are really

23

for the trial judge, because what they call for is the

24

expertise of the trial judge, and they are so minor that

25

if you start getting court of appeals into all that thing,
6

1

what you will produce is an unbelievable mess, where the

2

courts of appeals try to figure out every possible

3

ramification of the application of every application note

4

in the guideline.

5

accepting --

6

That's what I'm worried about, with

MR. STRANG:

Sir, I understand the concern.

I

7

think -- first let me note, Justice Breyer, that the

8

functional consolidation term comes only from the Seventh

9

Circuit and some of the other court of appeals, the

10

application on the guideline themselves refers simply

11

to -- well, the application note refers simply to

12

consolidation.

13

It is a question of what type of guideline are

14

we applying here, and clearly if we confine ourselves

15

today to the realm of Federal sentencing, United States

16

sentencing guidelines, I would submit clearly that some

17

guidelines never rise above fact in their application.

18

Others I think are altogether discretionary in their

19

application.

20

into that category.

21
22
23

Many of the Chapter 5 guidelines would fall

Still others, including the consolidation
question here, I think are the sort of mixed question -QUESTION:

What I'm thinking is that the words,

24

joint sentencing, are words that every trial judge in the

25

United States would understand reasonably well, and
7

1

they're words that I as an appellate court judge would

2

have a very crude understanding, and therefore I'd like to

3

know what the trial judge thinks about it rather than what

4

I think about it.

5
6

MR. STRANG:

understanding would be any cruder.

7
8

I don't know that Your Honor's

QUESTION:

I haven't done joint sentencing.

Every one of them has.

9

MR. STRANG:

But the determination is one that I

10

think peculiarly is made here on court documents --

11

transcripts, pleadings, orders, at least in the ordinary

12

case.

13

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose you could have a case

14

where the trial judge says, if there are two different

15

attorneys for the State appearing, asking -- at a single

16

sentencing proceeding, that there are two different

17

attorneys for two different offenses and there are two

18

different sentences, that, as a matter of law, is not a

19

consolidated sentencing.

20

I suppose a judge could say that, and if he said

21

that, then I think that you have a fairly strong case that

22

this would be a statement of such generality, that is

23

reviewable de novo.

24

MR. STRANG:

25

QUESTION:

And -Is that your point?
8

1

MR. STRANG:

2

QUESTION:

Well, yes, and I -All right.

Now, but won't there be

3

some other cases where it's not quite so clear, and where

4

the judge said, well now, you know, I know how these State

5

court judges work, and it's clear to me that the two

6

sentences were related because the length of the drug

7

sentence term must have been calculated by reference to

8

what he gave for the robbery term.

9

different case, or would it?

10

MR. STRANG:

That might be a

I don't know that it would, because

11

it really turns, I think, on the guideline one is

12

applying, and if anything is true of the scheme that the

13

Sentencing Reform Act established, it is that an exercise

14

of discretion, if that's what Your Honor is describing,

15

must be explained so that it can be assessed for

16

reasonableness.

17

It is also, I think, true here that facts must

18

be found, whether that's the whole of the inquiry or

19

whether that's simply the predicate, then, to applying the

20

legal standard to classify the facts.

21

QUESTION:

Do we ask ourselves, does deference

22

mean that two different trial judges could reach different

23

conclusions and both would be accepted?

24
25

MR. STRANG:

That is exactly what I think it

means, and to put it in concrete terms, I think what it
9

1

means here is that if Paula Buford had a twin, John, who

2

had done the very -- who had committed the State court

3

crimes in 1992 with her, also the 1998 Federal crime, but

4

he had been sentenced by the district judge below Judge

5

Stadtmueller and had received a 7-year or 84 to 105-month

6

sentence, whereas Paula for the exact -- in the exact same

7

situation had received nearly 16 years, a court of appeals

8

giving clear error review would be bound to affirm both of

9

those convictions and sentences.

10

QUESTION:

I could see that happening if, in the

11

case, I suppose, the Federal judge was trying to ask what

12

the State judge likely did with reference to trying to

13

balance the two sentences.

14

point if he says, as a matter of construction of this

15

statute, that two attorneys, two offenses, two separate

16

sentences does not mean textually that they're

17

consolidated.

18

I think you'd have a stronger

They are not consolidated.

MR. STRANG:

And that, of course, implicitly is

19

what this district judge said, and the relevant, or the

20

most important pages are 21 --

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. STRANG:

I think he came pretty close to that.
Yes, he did.

He took note that,

23

you know, the facts appeared undisputed.

24

try to apply the guideline and the -- I guess he called it

25

the applicable application notes, and then made comment
10

He was left to

1

about there being two separate prosecutors, albeit from

2

the same D.A.'s office, pursuing separate interests.

3

There were two separate pieces of paper entered reflecting

4

judgments.

5
6
7
8
9

QUESTION:

And there was no formal

consolidation.
MR. STRANG:

That is true, there was no formal

order of consolidation.
QUESTION:

And it's possible the court of

10

appeals could say, this is too complicated, unless there's

11

a formal consolidation we won't apply the guideline that

12

way, because that isn't even settled, is it, that this

13

notion of functional qualification doesn't come out of the

14

guideline, doesn't come out of any application note.

15

something that some courts made up.

16

MR. STRANG:

17

QUESTION:

It's

Yes, in a word -And if there is to be any kind of

18

uniformity infused in this process, why should it come

19

from the court of appeals rather than the Sentencing

20

Commission?

21

could see crimes that happened simultaneously.

22

I mean, you could see common scheme.

You

But this notion of consolidation, a judge could

23

consolidate just because the guy happened to have

24

committed a number of crimes totally unrelated.

25

doesn't have the coherence that the other two categories
11

It

1

have, so why shouldn't this be something for the

2

Sentencing Commission to straighten out, and then there

3

would be uniformity, to get the uniformity that way rather

4

than sticking the court of appeals into the picture?

5

MR. STRANG:

The Sentencing Commission very well

6

can, and is empowered to address questions and to try to

7

advance clarity in that way.

8

nothing about the question on certiorari granted here,

9

which is the standard of review, and the Sentencing

That, of course, says

10

Commission cannot tell this Court the standard of review.

11

I think also, if we're talking, then, about the

12

substantive rule of --

13

QUESTION:

No, but your argument -- I mean, if

14

this is the point of Justice Ginsburg's question, your

15

argument is that the only way to get uniformity is to have

16

de novo court of appeals review, and the point made in

17

response to that is no, you could achieve substantial

18

uniformity by having more detailed prescription by the

19

Sentencing Commission of what constitutes consolidation

20

and then having the usual deferential review.

21

MR. STRANG:

22

QUESTION:

I -So long as the details are

23

significant enough, you know, complete enough, you'll get

24

reversed even on deferential review if you fail to follow

25

them.

Why isn't that a more sensible way of achieving the
12

1

uniformity that you're after here?

2

MR. STRANG:

I -- in the world of could, I agree

3

with much of what Your Honor said.

4

by de novo review vis-a-vis deferential review.

5

so as between courts acting on the question, I think the

6

courts of appeals are better situated to provide

7

uniformity.

8
9

Uniformity is advanced
I mean,

The Sentencing Commission could -- is a coactor here, there's no question, but there's also no

10

question that Congress did not mean that the commission

11

would oust the Federal courts of appellate jurisdiction,

12

quite the contrary.

13

Reform Act -- it included 3742 -- and giving the appellate

14

courts a much more active role in reviewing sentences than

15

ever they had before in this --

16

QUESTION:

This was part of the Sentencing

That's true,

but they don't have --

17

I mean, they left to the courts to work out what would be

18

a sensible relationship among trial court, appellate

19

court, and Sentencing Commission, and therefore I would

20

think what Justice Ginsburg said was highly relevant.

21

MR. STRANG:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. STRANG:

It -That -Again, the Sentencing Commission

24

could act.

It is also clear -- and this is in the

25

legislative history that we cited.
13

It's clear that

1

Congress had in mind that appellate decisions would assist

2

the Sentencing Commission in determining what it is that

3

needed clarification or revisitation, so I don't think

4

it's an either or --

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. STRANG:

7

QUESTION:

No, it's not either or --- situation.
But you can certainly say that when

8

you have the kind of question that trial judges know quite

9

a lot about, where appellate judges know not that much,

10

where it is highly complex and factually related, that one

11

should rely upon the Sentencing Commission to provide the

12

necessary uniformity, and that would be a strong argument

13

in favor of deferential review here.

14

MR. STRANG:

Well, I don't know that it would.

15

My problem is that you are then leaving the Sentencing

16

Commission to look at the largely unreported work of

17

district judges in 94 districts, rather than looking at

18

the largely reported work of appellate judges in 12

19

circuits, as I understand it, so I'm not so sure, Your

20

Honor, that de novo review still isn't the better way to

21

interact with the commission.

22

That said, again I want to make clear that the

23

commission has the role that Justice Ginsburg posits, and

24

that it is not every guideline or application of guideline

25

that I suggest is appropriate for de novo review under
14

1

this Court's teaching.

2

think is peculiarly appropriate.

3
4

QUESTION:

This one, yes, consolidation I

And why is it peculiarly suited to de

novo review, Mr. Strang?

5

MR. STRANG:

One, the overriding importance of

6

uniformity here, which I think elevates the need to

7

clarify and develop.

8
9

QUESTION:

Why is uniformity more important with

respect to this guideline than any other?

10

MR. STRANG:

Oh, no, the guidelines generally,

11

Mr. Chief Justice, I'm sorry.

12

the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984.

13

QUESTION:

The guidelines in general,

Well, I thought you were saying that

14

uniformity is important with respect to this particular

15

guideline.

16

respect to every single aspect of the guidelines?

17

You're saying uniformity is important with

MR. STRANG:

Yes, and I'm sorry, the confusion I

18

created.

I am saying in a sense both.

19

here is important in Federal sentencing, but when we're

20

talking about a guideline that has a complex statutory

21

standard, as this one, and is not a matter of purely

22

individualized application such as acceptance of

23

responsibility, or a decision whether to depart upward or

24

downward for some unconsidered fact, then I think

25

uniformity of the rule, clarity of the rule, the meaning
15

Uniformity always

1

of the legal standard is exceptionally important.

2

QUESTION:

Why is that more important than, say,

3

the clarity of the rule with respect to, say, acceptance

4

of responsibility?

5

MR. STRANG:

Acceptance of responsibility falls

6

closer to the realm of what this Court has called

7

supervision of litigation.

8

that cannot be transmitted by transcript, or are not

9

available to a court of appeals.

It is dependant upon factors

The defendant's

10

demeanor.

11

You know, a variety of issues that may appear only off the

12

record and therefore concern conduct immediately before

13

the district court.

14

The manner in which he interacts with counsel.

I think to follow on my answer to Your Honor's

15

earlier question, a clear rule of decision I think is

16

important here for consolidation, because the potential

17

disparity in otherwise like-placed persons is so great, as

18

the facts of this case demonstrate.

19

QUESTION:

One clear rule for appellate courts

20

that recognizes the expertise that district judges have

21

might say, I reject this notion of functional

22

consolidation.

23

so if it's consolidated, formally consolidated, that's one

24

thing.

25

That would hardly benefit people in your client's

Either it's consolidated or it's not, and

If it's not formally consolidated, forget it.

16

1

situation.

2

MR. STRANG:

That's exactly the path that the

3

First Circuit now has gone, no consolidation unless

4

there's a formal order of consolidation of record, but de

5

novo review of the question of the consolidation question.

6

QUESTION:

But wouldn't there be a huge

7

temptation for a court of appeals to take that position,

8

therefore to reduce the number of cases that would come to

9

it?

10

MR. STRANG:

I don't know, never having been in

11

that position.

12

not overwhelming.

13

allow some development of the law, but it's certainly not

14

overwhelming, and what the rule of decision would be, I

15

have an opinion about what it ought to be.

16

play out I'm not sure with any confidence I can suggest to

17

Your Honor, and I'm of course here focused on the standard

18

of review.

19

The number of cases raising this issue is
It's -- I think it's sufficient to

How it would

I'm not sure that's a satisfactory answer.
QUESTION:

You alluded to the number of cases

20

that would be implicated by the decision and you said, you

21

know, it's not an overwhelming number.

22

it's not so far as the application of the decision to

23

beyond career criminal --

24

MR. STRANG:

25

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose

The career offender?
-- the Career Offender Act, but I
17

1

suppose there would be an application whenever guideline

2

sentences were imposed in consideration of prior offenses,

3

and I suppose the number of those would be enormous.

4

MR. STRANG:

Well, certainly the question of

5

relatedness of prior cases can arise in any calculation of

6

criminal --

7

QUESTION:

And it -- I mean, it must do so

8

thousands and thousands of times a day in the Federal

9

system, mustn't it?

10

MR. STRANG:

11

QUESTION:

Yes.

They can arise, the --

So if we rule your way, and we say

12

there should be de novo review here, in effect as a matter

13

of law, then I would suppose the courts of appeals are

14

going to be faced with a tremendous number of challenges

15

having nothing to do with the Career Offender Act.

16

MR. STRANG:

I think not.

I mean, the narrow

17

question here is consolidation as the path to relatedness,

18

and at least --

19

QUESTION:

Yes, but I don't see how we could --

20

well, maybe I should ask this question.

21

upon which we could say that the consolidation question

22

should be reviewed de novo, but other questions of

23

relatedness need not be?

24
25

MR. STRANG:

Is there a basis

The Court conceivably could do

that.
18

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. STRANG:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. STRANG:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. STRANG:

Well, conceivably, but I mean -Well --- sensibly?
Yes.
How?

Tell me what the rationale is.

The rationale would be that, as I

7

suggested earlier, the initial screening, the question of

8

an intervening arrest, ordinarily, at least my mind

9

struggles to find a situation in which that would present

10

more than a factual or pure factual issue.

11

occur on the same occasion?

12

that's a fact-bound, entirely fact-bound inquiry.

13
14

QUESTION:

Did crimes

Ordinarily it seems to me

Right, but that does not exhaust the

universe of questions about relatedness.

15

MR. STRANG:

16

QUESTION:

That's correct, it does not.
And so I come back to my question to

17

you, could we classify consolidation as in effect an issue

18

that should be reviewed as if it were a legal issue and

19

hence de novo, and at the same time on some principle

20

basis say that generally the question of relatedness is

21

not to be treated as if it were a legal issue and subject

22

to de novo?

23

Can we split the baby that way?

MR. STRANG:

I think the Court could.

Whether

24

prudentially it ought is another question, but I think it

25

could because at least as I read this Court's prior
19

1

decisions on mixed questions it really becomes a matter of

2

deciding, does the balance tip factual or does the balance

3

tip legal?

4

level in the hierarchy, or toward the middle?

5

Does it tip toward one class of judges, one

QUESTION:

Oh, no, I realize that, but the

6

problem I'm having is simply the fact that there's

7

something peculiar about this issue, because consolidation

8

is simply a subset of relatedness.

9

MR. STRANG:

10

QUESTION:

Yes.
And it would seem to me to be

11

difficult, as a matter of principle, to say that the

12

consolidation issue gets de novo, whereas relatedness

13

generally does not, and I want to know if there is a

14

principle basis for making that distinction, what that

15

basis is.

16

MR. STRANG:

I think it's whether the mixed --

17

the mixture tips factual or tips legal is the best

18

principle I can identify.

19

QUESTION:

You're saying the statute has

20

different tests for relatedness, some of -- many of which

21

are mixed questions, and some of those are proper for de

22

novo review, and others not.

23

MR. STRANG:

This particular guideline yes, and

24

then the guidelines generally.

25

QUESTION:

May I just ask sort of a general
20

1

question?

2

We're construing a note in the guide -- in a particular

3

guideline.

4

and difficulty in figuring out what the consolidated means

5

or related means.

6

Commission could give greater particularity to in its

7

definition of the relevant terms?

8
9

To what extent, if there -- there is ambiguity

Isn't there something the Sentencing

MR. STRANG:

For the rule of decision, yes, Your

Honor, it could.

10
11

We're not really construing a statute here.

QUESTION:

It just sort of strikes me it's sort

of a strange issue for us to be wrestling with.

12

MR. STRANG:

Well, and of course under Stinson,

13

although this is not a statute it's binding law, so it

14

doesn't merit less time or consideration in that sense, I

15

think, but again I have to acknowledge because of

16

Mistretta we have the Sentencing Commission out there, and

17

when we get to the question of the rule of decision,

18

having first settled the standard of review, yes, the

19

Sentencing Commission can weigh into that.

20

QUESTION:

Isn't there something to be said,

21

too, for discouraging rather than encouraging a great

22

number of appeals of sentencing factors to the court of

23

appeals?

24
25

MR. STRANG:

But I think de novo review does

that, and it's the point I wanted to make in response to
21

1

Justice Souter's question as well.

2

understand the theory, or a theory of de novo review, is

3

that as the law develops clarity through that process

4

lawyers and district judges are more likely to get it

5

right and to know that.

6

bright.

7

QUESTION:

At least as I

The district court is very

Well, that's a very optimistic

8

picture of the legal profession.

9

(Laughter.)

10

MR. STRANG:

11

QUESTION:

Well, it -You know, I sometimes think we take a

12

case here to decide a question and the opinion we write

13

deciding it creates three new questions for lawyers to

14

argue about, so I don't think certainty is very certain in

15

anyway, but just as a practical matter it seems to me it's

16

better to have these things resolved finally by the

17

district courts in some cases than simply appealed to the

18

court of appeals.

19

MR. STRANG:

Well, in the end, Your Honor, where

20

that would take us is back to the persuasion that the

21

district courts are best able to provide uniformity in

22

sentencing and that, indeed, at page 12 of the United

23

States brief, is an assertion it makes, and that's simply

24

at war, I suggest, with the basic congressional findings

25

and purposes of the Sentencing Reform Act, that it was
22

1

precisely the lack of uniformity with largely unsupervised

2

district judges --

3
4

QUESTION:

It motivated the Sentencing

Commission --

5

MR. STRANG:

6

QUESTION:

Yes.
-- Act, there's no doubt of that, but

7

it's one thing to say that we don't want two people in the

8

same cell block in Leavenworth convicted of the same

9

thing, one serving 1 year and the other is serving 20

10

years, but when we get down to the finer points there may

11

be more to be said for discretion, assuming it's

12

consistent with the guidelines.

13

MR. STRANG:

Although this is a situation where

14

the difference -- although not 1 and 20 years, the

15

difference is really quite remarkable.

16
17

If there are no further questions, I'd like to
reserve a few minutes for rebuttal.

18

QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Strang.

19

Mr. Wolfson, we'll hear from you.

20

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R. Q. WOLFSON

21

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

22
23
24
25

MR. WOLFSON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The court of appeals properly applied a
deferential standard of review to the district court's
23

1

decision for two principal reasons.

2

the Sentencing Reform Act itself directs the courts of

3

appeals to give due deference to the district court's

4

applications of the guidelines to the facts and, second,

5

institutional considerations also support a deferential

6

standard of review.

7

for making the kind of fact-intensive decision that is

8

typically involved in applying the guidelines to a set of

9

facts.

10

QUESTION:

First, the text of

The district courts are better suited

Suppose, as in Justice Ginsburg's

11

example, a district court said there is no consolidation,

12

in my view, unless there's a formal order of

13

consolidation.

14

proposition, a general and very broad interpretation of

15

the text, which is susceptible of de novo review and which

16

ought not to vary from one court to another.

17

That's it.

MR. WOLFSON:

That seems to me a general

Justice Kennedy, I think I agree

18

with you.

19

interpret the guideline to mean that in no case may I

20

conclude that two prior cases were consolidated unless

21

there were a formal order of consolidation, and then

22

that's the rule of law, and then I apply the rule of law

23

to the facts of this case.

24
25

That is, if the district court said, I

Now, the court of appeals would be authorized to
review that rule of law in a plenary fashion.
24

1

QUESTION:

All right.

Now, suppose he says,

2

where there are two offenses and two attorneys and two

3

sentences, that is not consolidation?

4

MR. WOLFSON:

If he announces that as a

5

generally applicable rule of law that's -- that is, it

6

doesn't matter what any other fact of the case is, that is

7

the rule of law that applies in every case of this nature

8

that will come before me, that is a rule of law.

9

But if he -- but if, on the other hand, what he

10

is doing is saying, I read what the court -- I read the

11

standard that has been enunciated by the court of appeals,

12

and that is, there may be such a thing as functional

13

consolidation, and now I'm going to determine whether the

14

disparate facts of this case answer to that description,

15

and I see there are 15 salient facts in this case and

16

eight of them tip in one direction but seven in another,

17

and on balance I conclude that it's not functionally

18

consolidated, that is --

19

QUESTION:

20

very careful judge.

21

only inference of consolidation is the fact that the

22

sentences were imposed in two different cases.

23

almost a negative formulation of the hypothetical rule I

24

gave you.

25

He didn't do that here.

He was a

He did say, I'm left to conclude the

MR. WOLFSON:

That's

Well, he said a lot -- actually,
25

1

Justice Kennedy, I think he said --

2

QUESTION:

He then does go on.

3

MR. WOLFSON:

He said more than that.

I mean,

4

I'm -- I would point the Court to page 21 of the joint

5

appendix which, without belaboring it too long, he also

6

did go on to say there were guilty -- there were separate

7

guilty pleas entered, there were two separate judges, you

8

know, he found there was no agreement among the parties

9

that the cases would be consolidated, so I think really

10

what he was doing was answering to the other description

11

that I was discussing which he was saying, here's how I

12

think the facts of this case ought to be classified

13

according to a legal standard, and that is the application

14

of the guidelines to the facts, which Congress --

15

QUESTION:

16

question of fact and law here?

17

Well, do you think this was a mixed

MR. WOLFSON:

I think it's best viewed that way,

18

Your Honor, a mixed question of fact and law.

19

consolidation is -- can be understood as a legal concept

20

and functional consolidation.

21

common -- I think more clearly a mixed question of fact

22

than law is the common scheme or plan idea.

23

That is,

It's similar to the

If anything, this perhaps seems a little more

24

factual.

I think the common scheme or plan notion of

25

relatedness is one that comes up very frequently, and that
26

1

is, I agree, is a mixed question of fact and law and, like

2

this case, if the Court were to apply that application

3

note to a set of facts, that should be reviewed

4

deferentially on appeal, and it's very --

5

QUESTION:

Well, I understand that the necessity

6

for allocating resources of the courts at the different

7

levels in the right way, but it seems to me if you had a

8

twin case to this that it should have come out a different

9

way.

I just don't see what discretionary findings, what

10

deference that ought to be given to the trial judge in

11

this very case.

12

I'm not saying that other consolidation cases

13

there wouldn't be some factors, say if the judge, the

14

Federal sentencing judge said, well now, these State

15

judges I'm sure must have balanced the two sentences and

16

that makes them related.

17

MR. WOLFSON:

Justice Kennedy, I think what the

18

district court was doing in this case was saying, when I'm

19

asked to consider whether something is functionally

20

consolidated, I'm really considering did the previous

21

State court system treat the two cases as though they were

22

one?

23

did, so I have to look at the record of what happened in

24

those two cases and see how the court system treated this

25

case.

Now, there's no order specifically saying that they

27

1

Now, there isn't a, kind of an immediately

2

obvious answer, so the court had to look at the way that

3

those cases were treated from the complaint stage all the

4

way until the sentencing, and there were various factors

5

that strongly indicated that the two cases were not

6

consolidated.

7

They were assigned to two judges.

8

I'm not going to wait for sentencing in the other judge --

9

in the other case, it's too long, I'm going to go full

10
11

They were charged by separate complaint.
One of the judges said,

steam ahead on this case.
So I think the evaluation, the district court's

12

determination that the totality of the facts have a

13

certain character is what we view as the application of

14

the guideline to the facts, and that is what is entitled

15

to deference.

16

Now, on the institutional consideration point, I

17

don't think there's any reason to think that that task

18

would be done better if repeated by three appellate

19

judges, or at least that that task isn't -- doesn't --

20

that that function isn't worth the cost to the justice

21

system as a whole.

22

After all, although it's true that the judge did

23

not make credibility determinations in a classic sense, he

24

was required to draw inferences from a historical record

25

to sort of fill in the gaps, try to figure out why the
28

1

court system treated this case one way rather than

2

another, and that is a very fact-intensive determination,

3

and I also think there's not any particular reason to

4

believe that an agglomeration of appellate case law in

5

this subject would prove particularly useful for this --

6

QUESTION:

No, but that's why -- that's why

7

probably really -- I actually think, I guess, is if an

8

appellate court decided to review these things de novo

9

that would be fine.

If an appellate court decided to

10

review them with some deference that would be fine.

11

the people who ought to work it out are the Sentencing

12

Commission, I mean, which they can do, basically.

13

MR. WOLFSON:

14

QUESTION:

But

Yes --

So suppose I thought that, I mean, I

15

can't -- I promise you that I can get good reasons both

16

ways what it should be.

17

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, the Sentencing Commission,

18

of course, does review every district court sentencing.

19

Now, when one --

20

QUESTION:

In other words, the way the

21

Sentencing Commission would work it out is, it would

22

tolerate differences among the circuits in that respect,

23

unless it really began to show up in different sentences

24

being given to different people, at which point all they'd

25

have to do is write a new application note.
29

1

MR. WOLFSON:

2

QUESTION:

Well --

They would assign it to a staff

3

person, look into it, write a new note that's clearer, and

4

vote on it, and that's the end of that.

5

MR. WOLFSON:

But of course -- well, of course,

6

that's true of many aspects of the administration of the

7

sentencing system.

8
9

QUESTION:

That is -Yes, and normally we don't hear them.

Normally we leave --

10

MR. WOLFSON:

It's true of permissible bases for

11

departure.

12

other sentencing guidelines applications that are of very

13

similar character, whether somebody is a minimal

14

participant in an offense, whether his crime involved more

15

than minimal planning --

16

It's true of -- I mean, other -- there are

QUESTION:

Not quite the same, because those

17

usually are very fact-related to the facts of the crime,

18

while this, in fact, is a matter of judicial

19

administration, which we could say judges throughout the

20

system are somewhat more familiar with.

21

MR. WOLFSON:

22

QUESTION:

Well --

It's unlikely you'll get an odd

23

factual situation with something like consolidation, isn't

24

it?

25

it's fairly clear whether the cases were consolidated or

I mean, this is a sort of weird case in that normally

30

1

not consolidated, isn't it?

2

MR. WOLFSON:

It may not be entirely clear

3

whether a case was functionally consolidated, and it may

4

not --

5

QUESTION:

That's a concept the courts make.

6

MR. WOLFSON:

And it may not be clear whether a

7

case -- it may not be clear whether a case involved a

8

common scheme or plan.

9

defendant's prior offenses involved a common scheme or

Courts can reach whether

10

plan.

11

about a set of facts on that case.

12

Courts can permissibly reach different conclusions

The point I'm trying to make is that, you know,

13

if a district court on review of a court of appeals, say

14

it were de novo, were to say well, this case is plainly

15

functionally consolidated, or this case is functionally

16

consolidated because this defendant's two prior offenses

17

in Wisconsin State court were consolidated, I don't think

18

that helps the district court decide any later case say

19

well, this defendant's Alabama offenses were -- were

20

functionally consolidated.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Wolfson, by answering as you did,

22

you're sort of accepting this functional consolidation

23

notion.

24

with these -- this consolidation notion of whether it

25

should be a consolidation order or, we're not going to

Has the Government taken a position in dealing

31

1

mess with functional consolidation, or has the Government

2

just not taken a position on that?

3

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, we have argued in some lower

4

courts, Your Honor, that consolidation means formal order

5

of consolidation, but the Seventh Circuit has ruled

6

otherwise.

7

otherwise.

8
9

Several other courts of appeals have ruled

We haven't asked those courts to reconsider that
rule of law.

We're not asking this Court to reexamine

10

this.

11

is -- that there is such a thing as functional

12

consolidation, and the more important question to us is

13

how that concept, as with many -- as with the application

14

of many concepts in the sentencing guidelines, how that

15

concept is applied and how that application should be

16

reviewed.

17

the overall administration of the guidelines system,

18

and --

19

We accept the concept for this case that there

It's a more important issue to us in terms of

QUESTION:

May I ask this question, Mr. Wolfson:

20

if you do not require a formal order of consolidation, as

21

I understand your position, how could this have been more

22

consolidated?

23

imposed at the same time to run concurrently.

24

possibly could make it consolidated for purposes of

25

sentencing except a formal order?

One judge, one proceeding, two sentences

32

What other

1

MR. WOLFSON:

I think the other things that

2

could have made it more clearly consolidated would have

3

been, one plea bargain would have been a very, a very

4

important factor had that been in the other direction, one

5

district attorney who was there to represent the interests

6

of the State in both cases, and not two district attorneys

7

where one specifically --

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. WOLFSON:

10

But they could be --- abjured any interest in the

other case.

11

QUESTION:

But all those things could happen if

12

there were a formal consolidation, too.

13

have two district attorneys.

14
15
16
17
18

MR. WOLFSON:

You could still

You could, but I mean -- but I

think -QUESTION:

You could have no -- you could have

two plea bargains, too.
MR. WOLFSON:

And although there were concurrent

19

sentencing the judge understood the sentences to be

20

different sentences.

21

not entered in one sentencing order.

22

QUESTION:

That is, they were not -- they were

Well, just on two counts of an

23

indictment you get two different sentences, too.

24

I have difficulty understanding it because they were

25

concurrent, imposed at the same time by the same judge.
33

I mean,

I

1

don't know how you'd get more consolidated.

2
3

MR. WOLFSON:

If they had been determined

pursuant to a single plea bargain, Justice Stevens --

4

QUESTION:

Right, I see.

5

MR. WOLFSON:

I think one could reach a more --

6

a better conclusion that they were consolidated, because

7

it indicates that the -- you know, that the executive

8

branch was treating them as though they were inextricably

9

connected, but that's -- that was not what happened in

10

this case.

11

It was really a happenstance that they were

12

sentenced on the same day and it might well have been that

13

they were not.

14

to wait for the entry of the plea in the other case, I'm

15

going to go ahead with sentencing in my case, and that, I

16

think, is a strong factor that points in the opposite

17

direction.

18

After all, Judge Geske said, I'm not going

Now, of course, to go back to the standard of

19

appellate review point, I think there isn't any particular

20

reason to think that the court of appeals de novo review

21

would necessarily arrive at a better result, or a more --

22

as a systemic matter more accurate result of these

23

determinations, because the facts are so disparate.

24
25

There's also the point that surely when the
State court is deciding whether to consolidate cases, as
34

1

the Wisconsin State court said, or whether it's not, it's

2

not thinking, well, in some possible future Federal

3

prosecution --

4

QUESTION:

No, but the word consolidated, it's a

5

Federal question as to whether it's consolidated, isn't

6

it?

7

MR. WOLFSON:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. WOLFSON:

I think that's right.

It's whether it's consolidated --

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. WOLFSON:

Yes, right.

-- within the meaning of the note.
Right.

I think that's right, that

12

it's a Federal term.

I would ordinarily expect that if

13

the State court entered a formal order of consolidation

14

under its criminal rules that would be enough, absent some

15

extraordinarily unusual facts, but even so, I mean,

16

surely -- I mean, as the district court, as the district

17

judge pointed out in this case, you know, he did look at

18

the record in the State court.

19

QUESTION:

The thing that's interesting to me, I

20

have a lot of sympathy for your basic position, but on the

21

facts of this particular issue it seems a little hard for

22

me to swallow.

23

swallow is the district judge came out the other way and

24

said it's not even close.

25

to being consolidated.

The thing that's really hard for me to

He said they're not even close

35

1

MR. WOLFSON:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, of course --

If I remember it correctly.
I mean, the petitioner has not --

4

the petitioner has only argued that de novo review should

5

be applied, and the petitioner has not argued that if a

6

deferential standard of review is applied that the

7

judgment should be reversed, so that's -- you know, I

8

mean, that's the case as we take it.

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Wolfson, could the district judge

10

have taken into account that these cases were put together

11

for sentencing but that they could not have been put

12

together for trial?

13

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, I think that cuts -- you

14

know, the fact that they could not have been put together

15

for trial may cut in our direction.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. WOLFSON:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. WOLFSON:

That is --

Yes.
Right.

I'm suggesting that.
Right.

Right.

I think he could

20

have.

I'm not sure that the -- I'm hesitant to rely too

21

heavily on that, because I'm not sure that the Wisconsin

22

court rules forbid, flatly forbid consolidation for trial,

23

but they certainly presume that a drug case and a nondrug

24

case will not -- will proceed along separate tracks, and I

25

think that this, as the Seventh Circuit pointed out, you
36

1

know, that is a factor pointing against functional

2

consolidation in a case like this, because Wisconsin seems

3

to have a policy of not wanting such cases to be tried

4

together.

5

QUESTION:

Of course, the irony of that position

6

is that in this particular case the bank robberies and the

7

drug addiction seem to be related.

8

MR. WOLFSON:

9

QUESTION:

Seem to be --

Related in a realistic sense.

10

MR. WOLFSON:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. WOLFSON:

The prior bank robberies?

Yes.
Well, I don't think that's true

13

actually, Justice Stevens.

14

know, the facts -- I don't think that there's a showing

15

that the -- you know, the bank robberies and the drug

16

addiction were, you know, part of a, as we might say, part

17

of a scheme or part of a modus operandi.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

After all, although the, you

Well, she was robbing the banks to

get the money to feed her drug habit, as I understand it.
MR. WOLFSON:

Well, that is generally not enough

21

for a court to view cases as related, or even as part of a

22

common scheme or plan, I mean, you know, and the district

23

court was quite clear on that point and the court of

24

appeals agreed, and the petitioner didn't argue otherwise,

25

so I mean, it's a more narrow concept than that when one
37

1
2

is asking whether prior cases are related.
QUESTION:

Is it your position that under this

3

guideline we have to -- it has to be all or nothing de

4

novo review or deferential review, or can we parse it out

5

and say, common scheme and plan are deferential,

6

consolidation is de novo, or do we just make a mess out of

7

the guideline if we do that?

8
9

MR. WOLFSON:

I think that all three subprongs

of the relatedness test -- that is, common scheme or plan,

10

same occasion, consolidation, are applied -- are reviewed

11

under a deferential standard of review.

12

that there are never any legal questions that may be

13

involved in that, and those, as we discussed earlier,

14

would be reviewed de novo.

15

That's not to say

An example I can think of in this case is, the

16

guideline says that offenses are not deemed to be related

17

if they were separated by an intervening arrest, and so

18

there you might have to, you know, consider whether

19

something was a continuing crime, and the same would be

20

the case -- I'm sorry, I meant with the common, with the

21

same occasion subprong you might have to consider whether

22

the offenses were -- one of the offenses was a continuing

23

crime and that's a legal question.

24
25

QUESTION:

If we don't want to do that, if we

want to follow up on this idea, could we do this?
38

Could

1

you say, look, we're not here considering whether -- the

2

word in the guideline is consolidated.

3

in the application note is consolidated, right?

4

MR. WOLFSON:

5

QUESTION:

Or, no, the word

Right.

All right.

The word in the

6

application note is consolidated for sentence, and really

7

what we're considering in this case is not whether

8

consolidated for sentencing has to be de novo or

9

deferential.

10

We are considering, in the circumstance where a

11

court of appeals has decided that the words consolidated

12

for sentencing include something called functional

13

consolidation, then can the court of appeals decide that

14

that concept which is a subset of consolidation, namely

15

functional consolidation, maybe should be reviewed de novo

16

or not.

17

We don't have to get into whether the thing of

18

the document, you know, consolidation means when there's

19

an order.

20

concept called functional consolidation.

That's not before us.

21

MR. WOLFSON:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. WOLFSON:

We're considering the

Well, I think the rule does --

I'm rather tempted by that, so -I think the rule that we are

24

proposing does lend itself to a more general

25

applicability, Justice Breyer.
39

1

I mean, we have -- section 3742(e) does say that

2

the courts of appeals shall give due deference to the

3

district court's applications of the guidelines to the

4

facts, and that is a system-wide directive.

5

QUESTION:

It's --

My problem with it is that I can

6

think, probably, if you give me a few minutes, which I

7

won't take, of instances in this highly complex set of

8

rules and thousands of words in the guidelines where it

9

just will not turn out to be right always to let the

10

district court have its way when it applies a form of

11

words to a fact situation, but there will be many others

12

where it seems to be just the right thing to do, and

13

therefore a narrow holding might be preferable.

14

thought.

15

That's my

I'd like your view on that.
MR. WOLFSON:

Well, the statute does say due

16

deference, and so it doesn't exclude the possibility that

17

there will be situations where de novo review is

18

appropriate, as when the district court engages in a legal

19

interpretation of a guideline, or where it seems clear

20

that that's what it was doing in that particular case.

21

QUESTION:

Well, that's true -- I mean, under

22

deferential review, or you know, abuse of discretion, if

23

the district court comes to a legal conclusion that's

24

wrong it can be reversed on appeal, can it not?

25

MR. WOLFSON:

That's correct, but I am thinking
40

1

of, there are some guidelines where there may be legal

2

conclusions that the court has to engage in.

3

One thing -- one that has come to mind is the

4

definition of aggravated felony in section 2(l), where

5

there are both legal determinations to be made and then

6

applying those determinations to the facts, but I think

7

that one can presume as a general matter that when the

8

issue is a mixed question of fact and law, as the Court

9

described it in Miller v. Fenton, where it falls somewhere

10

between a pristine legal standard and a determination of

11

the raw historical facts, I think that as a general matter

12

where it falls in that category a deferential standard of

13

review will be appropriate.

14

QUESTION:

It's hard to -- the reason I find it

15

hard to do it that way is in the statute books you can

16

find questions where all you're doing is applying the

17

legal label to a fact situation, the most important thing

18

in the world, the least important thing, whether a newsboy

19

is an employee, whether a foreman is an employee.

20

The same description applies to what the judges

21

do.

22

I mean, that's a classical example, but that's what I'm

23

afraid of right here.

24
25

The consequences are enormously different.

MR. WOLFSON:

You see,

Well, one has to look at the, sort

of the system as a whole and the institutional
41

1

considerations and reach a judgment about how Congress

2

intended the system to operate, and I mean, certainly in

3

Koon, you know, the Court was aware that the question of

4

whether a permissible departure one way or another was,

5

had enormous significance not just in the facts of

6

particular cases.

7

It could mean a tremendous difference in the

8

defendant's sentence, and yet the Court concluded as a

9

general matter whether the district court concluded

10

that -- when the district court concluded that it was or

11

was not a permissible -- an appropriate basis for

12

departure, I should say, on the facts of the case was to

13

be reviewed deferentially.

14

Now, that's not to say that the Court couldn't

15

conclude that the answer it reached was wrong.

16

the Court reached such a conclusion in Koon, as a matter

17

of fact.

18

QUESTION:

I mean,

But under your view the trial courts

19

will not have any guidance from the appellate system even

20

as to what factors ought to be considered in whether there

21

was consolidation.

22

MR. WOLFSON:

23

Justice Kennedy.

24

not no review.

25

I don't think that's right,

That is, I think -- I mean, deference is

That is, I think a court can't -- if the
42

1

district court makes a clear error of judgment about

2

whether something was consolidated or was not

3

consolidated, just as if it makes a clear error of

4

judgment as to whether a defendant's prior offenses were

5

part of a common plan --

6

QUESTION:

Well, I'm thinking in the context of

7

this case, where we're pretty well agreed on what

8

happened, the two attorneys and the two different offenses

9

but the one hearing.

10

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, I mean, this case is -- I

11

can't think in this case, or a case like this, of any

12

facts, say, that would have been so out of bounds for a

13

district court to consider that it -- you know, that it

14

would have been completely erroneous to have considered

15

that fact, but looking at the system more generally and

16

not just consolidated but relatedness and applications of

17

the guidelines, I don't think that one should arrive at

18

the conclusion that due deference means no review at all,

19

just as is the case in departure decisions under,

20

departure decisions under the guidelines.

21

The courts of appeals can give the district

22

court guidance about what is inappropriate, an

23

inappropriate basis for departing in that situation.

24
25

QUESTION:
on this.

Isn't it -- maybe you could comment

It would seem to me, of course, you're right
43

1

that deference doesn't mean no review at all, but I would

2

think that it would be more difficult for a court to

3

review in a sensible and critical way a decision about

4

whether consolidation had occurred than it would have been

5

under the old law for a court to review whether a sentence

6

was appropriate when you're asking the question, should

7

the sentence have been 10 years or 20 years.

8
9

Here, we've got a case in which this question of
consolidation is going to make the difference, as I

10

recall, between doubling a sentence or not, and I would

11

suppose that in the absence of some clear rule it would be

12

more difficult to review the consolidation decision under

13

the guidelines than it would under the old law have been

14

to review the sentence itself, as, say, between 10 and 20

15

years, which is a very strange result.

16
17

Am I seeing things in a -- in the wrong way
here?

18

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, I think that -- I may not be

19

quite understanding, but I think that one has to assume

20

that the courts of appeals announce interpretations of the

21

guidelines and that the district courts then apply those

22

interpretations in a faithful manner to the facts of

23

cases.

24
25

Now -QUESTION:

Yes, but can you give me an

example -- give me an example, keyed to this case,
44

1

perhaps, of the kind of announcement of a rule governing

2

the meaning of consolidation that would be appropriate and

3

would actually make a practical, critical difference when

4

courts are reviewing consolidation solely for abuse of

5

discretion.

6

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, of course, if the district

7

court had -- I mean, assuming it hadn't been settled in

8

the Seventh Circuit, if the district court had said no

9

functional consolidation --

10

QUESTION:

No, but we're taking this case in the

11

context that there is something called functional

12

consolidation, and I -- I'm assuming that that really

13

could cover, as you in your argument a moment ago pointed

14

out, a tremendous variety of facts.

15

You said, you know, even if you come down with a

16

rule it would be difficult to review on a de novo basis

17

because of the extraordinary variety of facts, so we're

18

starting with the assumption that you've got functional

19

consolidation, number 2, that functional consolidation

20

covers a tremendous amount of district territory.

21

If you make those assumptions, what kind of a

22

rule on abuse of discretion review could a court announce

23

that would be of any critical help?

24
25

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, of course, if the district

court had refined that rule further and had announced
45

1

what --

2

QUESTION:

Ah, but all smart trial judges know

3

that the less they say the better, and smart trial judges

4

who want to keep control of sentencing decisions, which

5

the guidelines have made it very difficult for them to

6

keep control of, are going to keep their mouths relatively

7

shut.

8

MR. WOLFSON:

It may be that the functional --

9

that de facto or functional consolidation is sufficiently

10

fluid that, you know, in the ordinary course the district

11

court's determination is going to be controlling.

12

it's --

13

QUESTION:

I mean,

I thought your response to this was

14

going to be that you don't have to have the court of

15

appeals doing the job, that it should be done by the

16

commission.

17

MR. WOLFSON:

18

QUESTION:

Well, that's --

That the commission can promulgate

19

more detailed specifications as to what constitutes

20

consolidation if, indeed, more detail is needed, or

21

desired.

22

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, I think that's right, the

23

Sentencing Commission is there precisely to continue the

24

process of making the sentencing guidelines more uniform

25

by reviewing the experience of the district court.
46

1

QUESTION:

True enough, but the consequence is

2

now, since the commission has not done any such thing,

3

that it seems to me that the range of unreviewable

4

discretion is greater when a court is determining what is

5

or is not a functional consolidation than the range of

6

unreviewable discretion was under the old law when a court

7

was deciding whether to give 10 years, or 20 years, or 50

8

years.

9

MR. WOLFSON:

Justice Souter, one response I

10

would like to say is, I think as the commission and as the

11

courts refine the legal concepts farther and farther down,

12

and as the legal concepts themselves become narrower, I

13

think it's going to be the case that the district court's

14

determination whether any case where the facts of the case

15

fall within those legal concepts is more likely to be

16

upheld.

17
18
19

That is, if all we had was two cases, or if two
cases are related -QUESTION:

Okay, but I think what your argument

20

in fact means is, if the Sentencing Commission decides to

21

get into this with more detailed rules, then the

22

discretion is going to be limited, but if the Sentencing

23

Commission doesn't, then we are left with what seems to me

24

this rather ironic situation of less reviewable

25

discretion -47

1

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Wolfson, my understanding

2

of the rule before the sentencing guidelines came into

3

effect was that a majority of the circuits said there was

4

no review of sentencing so long as it was within the

5

limits specified by law.

6
7
8
9
10

MR. WOLFSON:

That's correct, if it was within

the statutory limits there was no review at all, but -QUESTION:

And didn't some circuits take the

position that there was an abuse of discretion review?
MR. WOLFSON:

Yes, but my point is, it's harder

11

to find, I think, an abuse of discretion inherently as the

12

legal rule that you're applying to a set of facts becomes

13

narrower and narrower.

14

QUESTION:

You're --

15

MR. WOLFSON:

I mean, as both the Sentencing

16

Commission and the court of appeals, I think that's sort

17

of inevitable.

18

Now, the court of -- if all that were available

19

in this case were the bare guideline that said related,

20

and there were no application notes, then as -- the court

21

of appeals would have then undertaken the task of refining

22

that concept of related, which is at a more general level,

23

and then would have applied it.

24

Thank you.

25

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Wolfson.
48

Mr. Strang, you have 3 minutes remaining.

2

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DEAN A. STRANG

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

4

MR. STRANG:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I

5

want to revisit the question of the Sentencing Commission

6

and the interplay with de novo review.

7

This Court in Mistretta approved the basic

8

structure and rule of the Sentencing Commission, of

9

course, and my view on that, or anyone else's, no longer

10

matters, but I think we cannot rely here too much on the

11

Sentencing Commission or cede the ground properly in

12

Federal courts.

13

For one, the Sentencing Commission never can fix

14

disparity in a given case, or cure a lack of uniformity in

15

the cases as they come.

16

or prevent that in the future.

17

QUESTION:

18

It can act only to try to reduce

Oh, I thought it can act

retrospectively.

19

MR. STRANG:

20

QUESTION:

I'm sorry.
I thought that its rules can be

21

retrospective, that it can, indeed, require resentencing

22

in light of its new rules.

23

MR. STRANG:

It can.

It can do that.

I

24

wouldn't expect it to do that in a situation like this.

25

In its -- its powers really are not so different in its
49

1

realm than would be Congress' power in the realm of

2

reconsidering what this Court does in the area of an

3

ordinary statute.

4

Congress can act there, too, to alter the rule

5

or even the standard of review, so I think it's clear,

6

3742 certainly makes it clear, I think, that Congress

7

envisioned here a critical role for the courts of appeals.

8

The question then is, well, at what level?

9

I want to note how much de novo and deferential

10

review look the same in terms of the mechanical tasks that

11

judges must undertake.

12

understand it, that differs.

13

It's only the conclusory act, as I

That is, the briefs must be read, the relevant

14

portions of the record must be examined, and in the end

15

the difference then is will reasonable, if inconsistent,

16

conclusions be allowed to stand -- well, yes, that's

17

deferential review -- or does a court of appeals simply

18

look for the right answer, de novo.

19

De novo review continues to have its place and

20

it has its place here, just as much, I think, as de novo

21

review admittedly on a case-by-case basis helps us

22

understand reasonable suspicion, or helps us understand

23

probable cause, or helps understand what in custody means

24

for Miranda purposes.

25

So in the end I'm married to the belief that the
50

1

word do in 37 -- thank you very much.
