Mr. Kneedler,

we'll hear from you again.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KNEEDLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

In this case, there are questions both of

11

jurisdiction and of the merits of whether the Attorney

12

General reasonably construed the act to conclude that

13

petitioner in this case, oh, excuse me, respondent in this

14

case is ineligible for discretionary relief under the

15

repeal of 1182(c).

16

I do want to make sure that I'm able to address

17

the merits question, but I did have a few things that I

18

wanted to address with respect to habeas corpus and the

19

constitutional question here.

20

One recent decision of this Court which I think

21

is instructive on the question of when, what sorts of

22

claims Congress must make a judicial forum available to,

23

is the Court's decision two terms ago in American-Arab

24

Anti-Discrimination Committee v. Reno in which the Court

25

concluded that a constitutional claim of selective

1

enforcement was not a

judicially cognizable defense to a

2

final order of removal, and in our view, if Congress could

3

provide under the immigration laws that that sort of claim

4

does not give right to a personal right to have a final

5

order of removal set aside, then it follows a fortiori

6

that Congress is not required to provide a judicial forum

7

for a failure by the Attorney General to grant

8

discretionary relief from removal that is purely statutory

9

in form and particularly here where the objection is a

10

non-constitutional objection

11

discretionary relief.

circumstance but you can see where I am going.

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

It's fanciful in this

If the claim is that I am not

21

subject to deportation or removal because the statute

22

doesn't apply, that is subject to judicial review under

23

this statute and we think that the suspension of habeas

24

corpus clause probably does require that a court be

25

available to entertain a claim that the person who is

subject to removal is not an alien and is not subject to

2

removal because in those cases, we will assume, this

certainly for purposes of this case, the executive would

MR. KNEEDLER:

Oh yes, no, yes, no, I'm sorry.

10

I was going to the constitutional claims that the

11

statutory judicial review procedures are inadequate

12

because they don't cover more things.

13

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, you certainly -

Things are covered anyway.?
Right.

That's absolutely right.

We think that the statute provides for judicial review of

the two fundamental points at issue in a removal

proceeding.

20

Zipper clause that this Court referred to in the AADC v.

21

Reno provides that all questions of law and fact,

including statutory interpretation and constitutional

interpretation can be heard only on judicial review of a

final order of removal in the Court of Appeals.

1

QUESTION:

With respect to habeas corpus, it is

2

not at all the case that Congress overlooked even in

3

Section 1252 the possibility of habeas corpus relief.

4

Subsection (A)(1) of Section 1252 establishes the general

5

rule of Court of Appeals review but it specifically carves

6

out an exception for situations in which an alien is in

7

expedited removal proceedings and as to that, Subsection

8

(e) of 1252 specifically provides for judicial review by

9

habeas corpus.

10

So Congress knew when to provide and preserve

11

habeas corpus by name in this statute.

12

limited category and did it in no other and 1252(b)(9),

13

the Zipper clause says that unless that it's specifically

14

provided for in 1252, the review is not available.

15

there could be any doubt as I mentioned even before

16

IIRIRA, Congress in AEDPA had repealed the provision of

17

the prior judicial review provision in Section

18

1105a(a)(10) that said that, provided for custody review

19

of aliens of their deportation orders, that that was

20

specifically eliminated.

21

it was doing in eliminating habeas corpus as such but

22

providing a fully adequate substitute, constitutionally

23

adequate substitute in the court of appeals, something

24

that this Court said in Swain Congress can do.

25

QUESTION:

It did it for that

And if

So Congress knew very well what

I have a question that perhaps the

statute answers.

2

If there had not been the provision, the specific

3

provision for habeas in the accelerated review cases,

4

would habeas review have been necessarily postponed in

5

those cases until after the court of appeals had finished?

6

In other words, I guess my question is was the provision

7

for habeas review in the accelerated cases in effect the

8

provision of kind of an alternative forum that otherwise

9

wouldn't have been available until the conclusion of the -

10
11
12

I just don't have it clearly in mind.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Do you mean, in the current law

or the prior law?

13

QUESTION:

The current law.

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

The current law.

No, it's a

15

substitute for, an expedited, a substitute for a court of

16

appeals review.

17

removal are reviewed only in the district courts, not in

18

the courts of appeal.

People in that category, their orders of

19

QUESTION:

Okay, what the prior law?

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

In the prior law, it was frankly

21

unclear to what extent habeas overlapped with court of

22

appeals review, and this was I think part of the problem.

23

Some courts have held that in habeas the alien could not

24

get review of the merits of the deportation order but

25

could just challenge the detention.

Some courts have

1

allowed some review of the deportation order, which, of

2

course, would have provided for duplicative review in the

3

courts of appeals and the district courts.

4
5
6

QUESTION:

Might that have been the reason for

the specific provision under the new law?
MR. KNEEDLER:

No, I think the reason under the

7

new law was one of expedition , to not have two stops in

8

the court but only one petition for review in the courts

9

of appeals.

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, the competing habeas

11

provision in this period of uncertainty, whether you could

12

go to both places, that was in the Immigration and

13

Nationality Act itself.

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

It wasn't 1143, was it?
It wasn't?

I'm sorry.

It wasn't the general habeas statute.
Well, as we explain in our brief,

17

the provision in the INA was necessary to preserve that

18

habeas corpus because the prior act was worded, the

19

judicial review is in the courts of appeals under the

20

Hobbs Act except, and as this Court said in Stone there

21

were a series of exceptions that follow that, one of which

22

was the specific exception for district court habeas.

23

Now, whether one views that exception as itself a grant of

24

habeas or a preservation of habeas under 2241, we think is

25

essentially irrelevant.

In either event, the expressed

exception to seek, to preserve that was necessary and to

2

our knowledge no court held --

3

QUESTION:

That wasn't my question.

4

was you referred to, wwas it 11?

5

repealed?

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

7

QUESTION:

My question

The one that was

1105(a)(10).

Yes, yes.

And so, in the period of

8

when you could go one place or the other, wasn't it the

9

1105 that was used to get into the district court?

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

Some courts said it was 2241.

11

Some said it was 1105(a).

12

and there was really no reason to.

13

the best way to look at it is that 1105(a) preserved

14

general habeas jurisdiction but you could look at 1105(a)

15

as a specific grant, but in either event, it was an

16

expressexception to what otherwise would have been an

17

exclusive court of appeals jurisdiction which the

18

legislative history we set out in our brief of the 61 Act

19

shows that Congress was aware that habeas corpus would

20

have been precluded if the statute had been permitted

21

toward - to be worded that way.

22

Some courts didn't explain it
In our view, probably

I also want to just briefly just touch on the

23

notion that there is an unconstitutional suspension of

24

habeas corpus if the Act operates in the way that we

25

describe.

And we think that that is clearly not correct.

1

As this Court said in Felker, first of all, habeas corpus

2

is available only insofar as it's provided by law.

3

courts are not free at large to address that question and

4

the Court also reiterated in Felker that Congress, that

5

it's essentially up to Congress, at least in the first

6

instance, to exercise the judgment as to what the scope of

7

the writ should be.

8

that's especially so because Congress has plenary power

9

over immigration and has to be able to balance the need

The

Beyond that, in this context we think

10

for access to the courts against, in this situation, what

11

Congress saw to be a critical need for expeditious removal

12

of criminal aliens who have already had a chance to test

13

their criminal convictions.

14

And finally, this Court has also said that

15

Congress, deference is owed to Congress with respect to

16

what due process procedures are appropriate for people

17

generally, and again, that's something where deference we

18

think is especially appropriate in the immigration

19

context.

20

For all of these reasons, we think Congress's

21

judgment as to what sorts of things should be subject to

22

review and what should not is due extraordinary deference

23

by this, by this Court.

24

believe that Congress is required to provide for judicial

25

review of a power that it has granted in the discretion of

And, in particular, we do not

1

the Attorney General.

2

right of the alien, much less a personal right that is so

3

fundamental that an alien should have access to courts,

4

must have access to courts, to litigate it.

5

This is not worded as a personal

Congress should not be put to the choice or put

6

in the all or nothing position of granting discretionary

7

powers to the Attorney General only at the cost of buying

8

into a system of judicial review.

9

AADC v. Reno, there are a number of discretionary

As this Court said in

10

determinations the Attorney General makes all the time

11

with respect to whether to institute proceedings in the

12

first place, whether to drop them along the way, whether

13

to perhaps not execute the order of removal at the end of

14

the day.

15

is not required to provide for judicial review of that.

16

Congress could conclude that this should be regarded in

17

the same way.

18

Those are all discretionary and surely Congress

QUESTION:

Could you just advise me, is it the

19

Attorney General's position, the Justice Department's

20

position, that anybody who is removable under this statute

21

will be removed?

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, the Attorney General has

23

the authority not to execute an order of removal if there

24

was - -

25

QUESTION:

And does he have regulations as to

1

how that, what is the present position is, I guess my

2

question.

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, there's certainly a general

4

rule that final orders of removal will be carried out

5

because that's what Congress had in mind, but Congress--

6

QUESTION:

Does the Attorney General bring

7

removal, removal proceedings under anybody that's within

8

the purview of this statute?

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

I, I can't represent that every,

10

that every case has been brought but one of the things to

11

bear in mind is that when Congress passed IIRIRA and

12

expanded the definition of aggravated felony, it made that

13

definition applicable to offenses that occurred before

14

1996 and in INS's view, that meant that Congress wanted

15

INS to do something about people who had previously

16

committed offenses and may not have been aggravated felons

17

before.

18

So, the general thrust of the INS's enforcement

19

efforts has been that but I certainly can't represent that

20

it would never decline to remove someone.

21

that in Accardi again an unexplained decision, this power

22

may well once have been exercised should not prevent

23

Congress from revisiting the question, revisiting the

24

question of how discretionary relief should be thought of

25

in saying for these purposes, it is constitutionally
12

And the fact

1

equivalent to the sort of discretion to institute

2

proceedings in the first place that was unreviewable in

3

AADC v. Reno even for constitutional grounds and has been

4

held unreviewable in other situations as well.

5

Now, to the merits of the question.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler,

Would you clarify one

7

thing?

You said that there is no more discretion under

8

the new statute, but you just answered a question that

9

says well there is discretion, but it goes on outside the

10

statute.

The Attorney General, is not required, even with

11

knowledge that there is a person who is qualified to be

12

removed, is not required to remove anyone.

13

is there but it's kind of a lawless discretion.

14

what you're telling us?

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

The discretion
Is that

Well, it's, the fact that it's

16

not judicially reviewable doesn't make it lawless.

17

are, there are either formal standards as --

QUESTION:
there aren't any..

That's what you were asked.

You said

You said that --

MR. KNEEDLER:

I don't, I don't, I don't believe

21

there are and this Court pointed out in AADC v. Reno that

22

there were internal guidelines for the exercise of that

23

discretion in the past and the INS --

24

QUESTION:

But you're not aware ofany?

MR. KNEEDLER:

I am not aware of, but Congress

1

could reasonably conclude that the statutory provisions

2

for cancellation of removal sets up a similar, or allows

3

the Attorney General to set up a similar regime but

4

doesn't in the process require judicial review of that in

5

the courts.

6

If I could turn to the merits question of

7

whether the Attorney General reasonably determined that

8

the repeal of 1182(c) does not provide a basis for relief

9

in this case.

First of all, Congress specifically

10

addressed the temporal applicability of all of Title III-

11

A of

12

309 of the act.

13

called a Title III-A effective date, which was six months

14

after IIRIRA was enacted, the delay obviously being put in

15

place to allow the Attorney General to set up the new

16

procedures.

17
18
19

IIRIRA

of which this repeal is a part in Section
In 309(a) Congress specified what it

And then Congress, in 309(c) specified what is
the operative event for applying that effective date.
MR. KNEEDLER:

What it said was that for people

20

in exclusion or deportation proceedings, note not removal

21

proceedings, an exclusion or a deportation proceedings as

22

of the Title III effective date, the amendments made by

23

Title III shall not apply but instead, the prior law, the

24

INA as in effect prior to Title III-A shall apply.

25

follows for people like the petitioner here, excuse me,

It

the respondent here, who was put in removal proceedings

2

after the Title III-A effective date that Congress

3

intended that the Title III-A provisions would be applied

4

and Congress enacted them as a package.

5

it eliminated deportation and exclusion and replaced it

6

with removal.

7

replaced it with cancellation of removal and it provided a

8

new system of judicial review.

9

QUESTION:

As I mentioned,

It repealed specifically 1182(c) and

Just in case.

Imagine I've read this

10

and it reminds me of these brain teasers in the

11

newspapers, it's very complex.

12

through reading all these complex arguments technically on

13

both sides, I got to the situation where I thought I want

14

to assume Congress would have wanted to do what was

15

basically fair in terms of retroactivity.

16

Then I thought there'd be, what's gone is the Attorney

17

General's discretion to deal with a sympathetic case.

18

I've thought of one.

19

children, the bread-earner of the family when, in his

20

youth, once stole a pair of tennis shoes in Massachusetts

21

- an aggravated felony under this statute, I think.

22

And suppose after I got

All right.

A man, 40, 45 years old, had several

Another time, on another occasion he stole some

23

fruit from a passing train.

seem to be the fair thing is at least you give him a shot

25

so that we he was 20 years old and was going to steal the

Now, what would

1

fruit from the train, he would know that that might mean

2

deportation.

3

would have wanted to do the fair thing, why wouldn't we

4

assume that at least it would give these people a shot so

5

that the second time they know the likely consequence.

6

Hence, we would apply this so that it applies to people

7

whose second felony, aggravated felony like stealing a

8

pair of tennis shows, I say slightly sarcastically but

9

it's within that, I think.

10

And so, if we're going to assume Congress

So that they'd at least know

when they did that what's going to happen.

11

Well, that's what I call the basic

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, with respect to the notice

13

point, Congress specifically made the definition of

14

aggravated felony applicable to offenses that occurred

15

before that enactment and that includes situations in

16

which someone might be rendered removable.

17

QUESTION:

Certainly the first one but let's say

18

the second one, so that now he knows what's going to

19

happen and, you see, that's what I call --.

20

you can't even get to that because you go through all the

21

technical arguments.

22

We're at that point.

Now, maybe

Is there any answer?

23

there any answer to that which suggests that the

24

application of the way you're doing it, and indeed, I

25

mean, you know, you go pick up people who are 60 years

They have families.

a few indiscretions and without any hope of mercy through

any kind of discretion, they're gone.

In their youth, they committed

this change in the law is not retroactive within the

there are a variety of ways in which that could be

understood but they all point in the same direction.

9

But beyond the statutory answer to the

And I would like to identify them because

10

they're different ways of coming at them.

11

this Court has said in Lopez-Mendoza and most recently

12

again in the AADC case that the enforcement of the

13

immigration laws is inherently prospective.

14

the question of whether aliens will be permitted to remain

15

in the United States in the future, whereas the Court said

16

in AADC, deportation is necessary in order to bring to an

17

end an ongoing violation of the law.

18

this is so is that part of the justification for

19

Congress's plenary power over immigration is as this Court

20

said in the Harisiades case, that Congress has to take

21

into account the contemporaneous policies with respect to

22

aliens.

who that is an alien in this country should be permitted

24

to remain and who should not.

It is a determination of who should be permitted

2

to stay in the United States in the future.

3

that can be made about 1182(c) and Congress's repeal of it

4

is that it operates much like the repeal of the authority

5

to grant injunctive relief.

6

grants, under the prior law, granted 1182(c) relief, it

was essentially an injunction against carrying out an

Another point

When the Attorney General

Well, this Court has made clear than when

10

Congress most recently in Miller v. French that when

11

Congress changes the authority for granting prospective

12

relief, that that change in the authority for granting

13

prospective relief has to be applied by the Courts at the

14

time that it is applied, that it arises.

power of the Attorney General not to any rights of the

Now, since

1

there's no intervening event upon which the immigration is

going to be predicated, it certainly is adding a

consequence that was not there when the immigrant entered

the guilty plea.

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

It has not added the consequence

6

to a guilty plea.

It may have undermined the alien's

7

expectation but this Court made clear in Landgraf that a

8

law that affects someone's pre-existing expectations does

9

not itself give rise to retroactivity analysis.

There's

10

not the slightest suggestion in this act that Congress

11

intended the application of the various provisions to turn

12

on whether someone pleaded guilty to the offense or did

13

not.

If I could reserve the balance - QUESTION:

cases, it does attach additional legal consequences to the

Secondly, the American Arab case, we think,

MR. GUTTENTAG:

this Court's decisions during the finality era when the

It certainly is analogous in the

sense that the Attorney General has decided what issue he

has jurisdiction over and he's decided that he has no

power to even consider these claims for relief.

6

that sense, it certainly goes to the Attorney General's

determination of what the statute means and what class of

cases he has jurisdiction to consider discretion and in

that respect it's certainly similar.

So, in

7

QUESTION:

That's exactly what I think it would

suggest.
MR. GUTTENTAG:

This Court has applied the same

8

principles that Congress must legislate explicitly in the

9

immigration context, not the Chew Heong case.

It did it

10

in Kessler v. Strecker.

It did it in Mahler v. Eby.

11

Again and again, it's precisely because the consequences

12

are so severe and I think that the consequences for an

13

immigrant to be deported on any real life practical

14

consequence are far greater than the imposition of damages

15

on an employer and there's a protected, as well as this

16

Court having recognized again and again that a permanent

resident has a protected liberty interest in being here.

18

It doesn't mean that Congress doesn't have the

power but it must do it explicitly.

And, again, as I say,

20

I don't think that there's anything in this statute, the

21

various provisions, there is not a specific provision that

22

says that even though the new definition of aggravated

23

felony sweeps very broadly, we acknowledge that and we

recognize that.

greatest reliance occurs, but we think anything - new

QUESTION:

Do you defend the distinction?

MR. GUTTENTAG:

That's not directly presented by this case and I might

note that when this Court decided the Hughes Aircraft

I'm not talking about ex post facto.

11

think there's a chance in the world that we would, that

from deportation which has been in the statute since 1917

discretion, those other kinds of things are very different

and that might be a unilateral hope but eligibility for a

waiver of deportation is not.

Those are

So, deferred action, and prosecutorial

I believe that the question this Court faces is

21

whether a pure question of law decided by the Attorney

22

General that will determine whether deportation becomes

23

mandatory for persons who committed offenses many, many

24

years ago at a time when the eligibility for relief was in

25

the law and their likelihood of receiving it was at least

fifty-fifty, whether that pure question is reviewable in

any court.

3

The Attorney General has decided that he lacks

4

all authority, not because he doesn't want to grant

5

relief, not because he thinks it might not be appropriate

6

in many, many cases but because the Attorney General

7

determined that he lacks the statutory authority because

8

Congress took it away from it.

9

ruling is wrong and that there is nothing in the statute

We believe that legal

10

that manifests the clear and unambiguous intent that this

11

Court has repeatedly held in the retroactivity context is

12

mandatory to impose those kinds of drastic new legal

13

consequences on long time legal permanent residents who

14

have made their lives, who have established their

15

families, and who have done nothing wrong but that one

16

offense, one time in the past and ever since complied with

17

the law and are now swept up in this change and subject to

18

mandatory deportation.

Thank you, Mr. Guttentag.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KNEEDLER

Yes, with respect to the cases

24

that I would rely on for nonretroactivity, Justice

25

Stevens, I would mention Kansas v. Hendricks where the

Court said there was no ex post facto violation because

the act wasn't retroactive even though it operated.

of the triggers was a prior conviction, but it looked to

current and future of status.

such cases.

Also, the Cox case

With respect to attaching new legal

consequences, that has to be proximate legal consequences

in the sense of the statute like Title VII itself imposing

penalties on prior conduct.

The immigration laws do not

regulate and penalize prior conduct.

right to remain in the United States so a new ground of

15

removal does not interfere with any pre-existing rights.

16

In particular, there was no right to expect to be granted

17

relief from deportation.

18

substantive ground, for removal would be retroactive, and

19

this Court's opinions would refute that, certainly taking

20

away a discretionary power in the Attorney General to

21

grant relief in the future is in no way retroactive.

22

think this case comes down to a question of deference to

the Attorney General under this Court's decision in

has reasonably construed the act not to allow
