ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. MARCELLE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This is a free speech case.

On page 13 of its

12

brief in opposition to certiorari, Milford concedes that

13

State law, the same State law at issue in Lamb's Chapel,

14

requires it to censor petitioner's speech from its broad

15

community forums at all times, to all audiences because

16

they had a religious purpose.

distinction that this Court buried in Widmar.

unconstitutionally-protected religious worship and

instruction.

MR. MARCELLE:

Yes, Your Honor, quite

2

extensively, and dissent as well said, Judge Jacobs said

3

the case couldn't be squared with Lamb's Chapel.

5

QUESTION:

Lamb's Chapel, if I'm correct, is not

even cited in the Second Circuit's opinion, is that right?

6

MR. MARCELLE:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. MARCELLE:

9

That's correct, Your Honor.

Isn't even mentioned?
Isn't even mentioned.

And I

think the way they got around Lamb's Chapel, Your Honor,

10

was really by embracing a distinction that this Court

11

rejected in Rosenberger, a distinction --

12

QUESTION:

I assume that the judge who wrote the

13

opinion for the Second Circuit was aware of Lamb's Chapel,

14

not just because you cited it, but because it had reversed

15

an earlier decision of his, isn't that right?

16

MR. MARCELLE:

That's correct, Your Honor. He

17

was the author of Lamb's Chapel that this Court reversed.

18

And I think the way --

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Marcelle, could you clarify for

20

us the nature of the right that you are asserting.

21

could the school district say we are not going to allow

22

access to any groups in off-school hours?

23

MR. MARCELLE:

24

QUESTION:

25

Now,

Absolutely.

And you contend that the school has,

instead of doing that, opened a limited public forum

MR. MARCELLE:

Could the school say only hours after

6 p.m.?

MR. MARCELLE:

MR. MARCELLE:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Your Honor, yes, they --

And only certain days a week?
Yes, Your Honor.

They have broad

discretion, the school board -QUESTION:

You're just seeking equal access on

10

the same terms that the school offers it to other groups

11

to benefit the welfare of the community, is that the idea?

12
13
14

MR. MARCELLE:

Exactly, Justice O'Connor. We're

not asking for unique access, just equal access.
QUESTION:

What if a church asks for privilege

15

to conduct church services once a week during the hours

16

the school allows?

17

MR. MARCELLE:

Because, Your Honor, Milford has

18

chosen to create a forum that it's probably the broadest

19

possible forum you could create, the uses that pertain to

20

the welfare of the community under this policy, I think

21

they would a Mass, or a church service would qualify, but

22

of course, they have the power and the discretion.

23

QUESTION:

So if one of the local churches came

24

in and said we'd like to use it one day a week to conduct

25

our regular services, that would have to be granted as

well, if it fell on a day and an hour when the school said

2

it was open?

3

MR. MARCELLE:

Yes, Your Honor, under this

policy.

5

limit it to athletic, just athletic events or just

6

theatrical events but they couldn't exclude religious

7

groups or religious viewpoints on those subjects.

Of course the school could write the policy to

QUESTION:

Well but, I think you can say that

the school, that the school couldn't exclude religious

10

viewpoints or religious groups and still not necessarily

11

say that it had to be open for a full dress religious

12

service.

13

MR. MARCELLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, that's

14

correct.

the broadest possible policy.

pertaining to the community you, I think, have created the

That's correct.

phrase is other uses that pertain to the welfare of the

1

content discrimination if there were say a church service

2

to be conducted the same time the Boy Scouts are meeting?

3

MR. MARCELLE:

I don't believe so, Justice

4

Ginsburg, for this reason.

When you choose, when you

5

choose, as Milford has in this case, to shut its school

6

down at 3 o'clock and thereby open up a public forum

7

inside your school, you can't restrict religious

8

viewpoints even if the viewpoint in the speech is exercise

9

in a religious ceremony.

10

QUESTION:

11

Amendment free speech right.

12

There is also an issue that hasn't been aired in this

13

case, and that is the issue that arose in Widmar and in

14

Murgens, the distinction between, for establishment clause

15

purposes, people of a certain sophistication versus

16

younger people.

But you are talking about a First

cornerstone group which was the student group that sought

access to the school was a religious group singing

because it was --

1

some role in the Court's decision, didn't it? That these

2

were college students who had a degree of sophistication

3

and could distinguish between just opening it up to

4

everybody, and the school endorsing it?

5

MR. MARCELLE:

That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.

6

And in this case, in Widmar, the appropriate community was

7

the students so you would look at the observer student,

8

but in this case, Milford has ended school and has opened

9

up a community forum for parents to initiate and parents

10

to run these community groups.

11

QUESTION:

12

What was at issue in Widmar? What,

what kind of activity?

13

MR. MARCELLE:

It was a -- praying and reading

14

the Bible and singing religious songs and teaching from

15

the Bible.

In, in the school or to the whole

school body, before the whole school body?
MR. MARCELLE:

Not before the whole school body,

students, you're dealing with grade school kids, kids

3

from, I think it was ages starting at six going up to 12.

You're doing it -- in this particular case, the meeting

5

was being held immediately after the school and the

meeting sounds to me as it was described as Sunday school.

7

They pray.

8

and they have a teaching lesson and I guess some

9

discussion, but it sounds like Sunday school, and isn't

They sing sort of children's religious songs,

10

the problem in this case that you don't have a

11

sophisticated group of people of college age who know that

12

the university is not proselytizing them or approving of

13

their particular religious practice, whereas in this case

14

you have a bunch of kids who just don't make those kinds

15

of distinctions, and isn't that the nub of the

16

establishment clause problem here, which didn't exist in

17

Widmar?

18

MR. MARCELLE:

If I may, Justice, be allowed to

19

give you, kind of, two answers.

20

because if this meeting was conducted at 9 o'clock at

21

night and was given just to adults, State law would

22

prohibit from them meeting under those circumstances.

23

QUESTION:

Well, that, that might be the case,

24

and it might be the case that you would have a different

25

case before us if those were your facts, but whether State

law would prohibit it or not, my question is, don't we

2

have here at least a substantial, I won't decide it from

3

the bench, but don't we have a substantial establishment

4

clause issue, which we simply didn't have in Widmar so

5

that you can't take Widmar as being direct authority for

6

what was going on here?

7

MR. MARCELLE:

8

I would say the answer -- and

that would be in the second part of my answer.

QUESTION:

10

Right.

MR. MARCELLE:

Get to number two.

-- to your, to your question, is

11

the parents are the ones who decide whether or not the

12

children will attend.

13

QUESTION:

He's worried about the other children

14

who are, who are supposedly hanging around the school

15

after the bell rings, instead of skipping off the way my

16

kids do.

17

other kids going into an activity which they think

18

represents the approval of the State for these religious

services.

Actually, and they are infected by seeing these

I think that's the point he's making.

question.

Scalia.

Was the point raised before the

MR. MARCELLE:

If I could search my memory and I

don't believe, or if it was raised, it was raised

tangentially, Your Honor.

It certainly wasn't the thrust.

QUESTION:

happen?
MR. MARCELLE:

Excuse me.

I think this case

should be reversed and remanded back to district court to

grant the relief we requested.

12

QUESTION:

And why, why should this issue not be

13

considered in the Second Circuit?

MR. MARCELLE:

I believe that Milford school had

the burden of proof.

But you were the Plaintiff in the

lost, and you appealed on that theory.

Yes.

issue was, was not aired, we should not decide it in the

judgment, and to defeat our motion for summary judgment,

2

they had the burden of proving a compelling State interest

3

and that the censorship forum, from the forum was the

4

least restrictive means to achieve that interest.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Marcelle, when the, when the

6

State refuses somebody something to which he is entitled

7

for the wrong reason, and the case is appealed up here,

8

and we say that reason was wrong, do we normally, if the

9

State comes in and says oh, we could have, we could have

10

done it for another reason, you know, not because of his

11

race.

12

normally remand to give him a second bite?

13

stuck with the reason that they gave?

14

We might have done it for some other reason, do we

MR. MARCELLE:

Aren't they

Well, I think, they are stuck

15

with the record as in any trial, on any appeal, you could

16

raise new issues and new grounds and could have a new

trial.

QUESTION:

This school said we will not let you

conduct this service, period.

MR. MARCELLE:

about it, but the Second Circuit did not rest its decision

on that grounds.

We were briefly, my recollection, questioned

QUESTION:

And in a trial court, the school

district made no distinction in its summary judgment

motions or in its answer based on the fact that this was

immediately after school?

10

MR. MARCELLE:

QUESTION:

I'm not sure --

The school district said it could bar

these, it could bar these meetings at any time of day?

13

MR. MARCELLE:

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And it's --

And it made no, and it made no

15

distinction between right after school or an hour after

school or two hours after school?

17

MR. MARCELLE:

That's correct, Justice Kennedy

18

and in fact on the joint appendix at G-4 and I believe

19

it's paragraph 13, it's the superintendent's affidavit

20

where he is basically says that your speech is too

21

religious to be using the forum.

No.

unconstitutional under the free speech clause.

could go back and revamp the policy and draw it more

narrowly, and I understood you to say, or to imply that if

23

it wanted to draw a policy that says no religious worship

involving young kids or something like that, that, that

would be open to it and I want to know whether your

Amendment prohibits drawing that distinction, if that,

whatever you called the worship fits within the otherwise

religious neutral boundaries of the forum.

Absolutely.

And moreover,

11

Justice Kennedy, I think there is also this problem. This

13

me the establishment clause was crafted to defend the

14

rights of the religious people to participate in broad

community forums and to exclude Andrea Fournier from a

value that the establishment clause was, was crafted to

defend, so if she wears her daisy scout uniform, for

21

the free speech clause protects her right to meet under

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. MILLER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court, the issue before this Court today is whether a

8

public school district may lawfully exclude a religious

9

group from conducting adult-led, adult-sponsored and

10

adult-initiated prayer and worship services and religious

11

instruction immediately at the end of the school day where

12

these activities involved the youngest children.

adult-sponsored make?

I assume the Girl Scout meetings

the fact that we have the Equal Access Act which we submit

21

that if Petitioner's position is accepted in this case,

22

the Equal Access Act will become meaningless because then

you will be able to have adult-led and adult-sponsored

religious activities occurring in a school which the Equal

Access Act would prohibit.

What it really excluded was a

discussion of morality that had a religious perspective.

MR. MILLER:

Well, Your Honor, that -- the facts

there is no development of the record in terms of what

I wouldn't necessarily say that,

Justice Scalia.

QUESTION:

18

MR. MILLER:

You just did say it.
Well, I -- the point I'm getting

across is that the activities of the Good News Club were

20

more than merely reciting one prayer. There was much more

21

involved in that which is fully developed in the record,

and those activities were much more religious and much

MR. MILLER:

Number one, I

think that even if it's not a -- technically an

district had a reasonable basis to conclude that it might

divisive of the community to allow this type of

utilization of the school building, and out of concern

that perhaps religions which did not predominate in the

is that there may be religious groups that do not have a

favoritism to this particular club.

Well, they wouldn't -- if they were

23

doing it for a for-profit purpose under New York law, that

24

wouldn't be permissible.

2

MR. MILLER:

Well, no, no, it wouldn't be a

3

permissible use was my point.

4

under the school use policy or under New York education

5

law 414.

6

It would not be permitted

It's simply not permitted.
QUESTION:

To prohibit the use of public

7

facilities for religious purposes shows the State is

8

neutral as to religion, is that your point?

9

MR. MILLER:

Justice Kennedy, I believe that we

10

are required to be neutral and permit the schoolhouse to

11

be used as a house of worship would violate, I believe,

12

the principle of neutrality.

13

QUESTION:

Why would it do so if, unlike this

14

case, there's no particular involvement of schoolchildren

15

involved, and the district allows the, let's say the

16

auditorium to be used for a meeting of the Elks, for a

17

meeting of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Baptists

18

have had their church burned, and they want to use it.

19

Why would -- what would the theory be that would explain

20

why it would be a violation of the establishment clause to

21

let the church group use it on the same terms as the VFW

22

and other secular organizations?

23

MR. MILLER:

Is Justice Souter's question in

24

reference to this specific record or is this a

25

hypothetical?

QUESTION:

No, no, I'm going back I think to

2

Justice Breyer's question, and I understood you to answer

3

his question in such a way that would say, yes, it would,

4

in my example, it would be a violation to let the church

5

group use it at the same -- on the same terms as the VFW,

6

and I don't understand what your reasoning is.

7

establishment clause theory that leads you to say that?

8

MR. MILLER:

What's the

Because you would be permitting

then a schoolhouse to be used as a house of worship.

In

10

the case of -- in our particular case, at 3 o'clock there

11

are lots of other educational activities going on.

12

QUESTION:

Well, if that was the case, in -- the

13

facts in Widmar, then, would have been an establishment

14

clause violation because in Widmar you had a state

15

university property that was being used for purposes of

16

worship, so that would have violated the establishment

17

clause.

18

MR. MILLER:

Well, Justice Souter, I believe

19

that Widmar is a totally different case. Number one, it's

20

an open forum as opposed to a limited open forum.

21

QUESTION:

But you're talking about the First

22

Amendment, and now we're talking about the establishment

clause.

question and Justice Breyer's, you would say that the

student worship service in Widmar on university property

MR. MILLER:

I would have to take the position

that with respect to that forum which had been open for

all purposes --

analysis.

We're not talking about forum

We're talking about establishment clause

8

MR. MILLER:

9

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.

Yes, sir, I understand.

In other words, I'm going from the

10

speech clause to the establishment clause.

Was the Widmar

11

worship service on public property a violation of the

12

establishment clause?

13

MR. MILLER:

This Court apparently held it

14

wasn't, although you looked at it as a free speech case,

so presumably --

QUESTION:

In this particular district, this

school district, we're dealing with elementary grades?

MR. MILLER:

QUESTION:

Correct.
Is there any practice with respect to

high school or public colleges in that area?

student groups that can meet for religious purposes as

Justice Ginsburg, that is not

to that.

that there were no other religious uses that went on at

that.

I believe, however, that the record reflects

Does the record show that there are a

while this service is conducting -- conducted?

Is that in

the record?

believe Justice Scalia is right, it is only a mandate that

2

Congress passed it.

3

they would have to allow certain other high school groups.

There is nothing in the statute that makes it a

prohibition to it, even in the absence of the law, to

allow other groups.

I believe as long as the forum is open, the --

be aware of the policy and the history and the context of

the situation and wouldn't view that the State was

You actually did use it before the prohibition was issued

MR. MARCELLE:

At what time

did you use it?

But you didn't use it?

MR. MARCELLE:

QUESTION:

At 3 o'clock.

And was there any

evidence about whether other grammar school students were

QUESTION:

16

MR. MARCELLE:

No, Justice Scalia.
