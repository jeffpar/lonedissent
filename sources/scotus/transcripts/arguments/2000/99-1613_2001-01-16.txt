CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

next in Number 99-1613, Robert Shaw v. Kevin Murphy.

5

Mr. Ohler.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID L. OHLER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MR. OHLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

10

This case presents the question of whether an

11

inmate has a freestanding right to provide legal

12

assistance to another inmate which entitles correspondence

13

from that inmate to special protection under the First

14

Amendment.

15
16

With respect to the facts of this case, the
question may be phrased --

17

QUESTION:

There's some discussion in the briefs

18

about the penalties that were imposed on the prisoner by

19

virtue of his writing the letter that he wrote.

20

those are not at issue here?

21

MR. OHLER:

I guess

I don't believe they are, Your

22

Honor.

In fact, I believe the respondent in his brief at

23

page 10 indicated that Mr. Murphy did not seek expungement

24

of the disciplinary action that was taken against him.

25

We believe, and with respect to the facts of
3

1

this case, the question may be whether an inmate can evade

2

censorship of communication and discipline for insolent

3

language contained in a letter to another inmate which

4

also contains legal advice.

5

If an inmate does not have a free --

6

QUESTION:

Can we take it as a given that this

7

was insolent language, because, you know, I'm somewhat

8

dubious whether this was insolent language, but that's a

9

given in this case?

10

MR. OHLER:

We believe it's a given.

We don't

11

believe that Mr. Murphy contested whether or not there was

12

sufficient evidence to find that he was insolent, and in

13

fact --

14
15
16

QUESTION:
that?

He had the opportunity to contest

He could -MR. OHLER:

He did, Your Honor, and as I

17

indicated to the question from Justice O'Connor, he has

18

not sought expungement of that disciplinary infraction.

19

If an inmate does not have a freestanding right

20

to receive legal assistance, as this Court stated in Lewis

21

v. Casey, then the corollary must be true, an inmate does

22

not have a freestanding right to render legal assistance.

23

It is petitioners' position that legal advice is

24

entitled to no greater protection than speech in general

25

in a prison context.
4

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Ohler, may I ask if -- at least I

2

understood that the position of the United States is not

3

the same as the one that you are telling us about, nothing

4

else being at issue but the insolence and the other

5

charge.

6

was that this should be remanded for consideration of

7

those factors of that part of the case in light of Turner

8

v. Safley.

9

I thought that the position of the United States

Is that wrong?
MR. OHLER:

That is the position of the United

10

States, and that is a position that we disagree with.

11

It's our position that once the cloak of special

12

protection is removed from the legal advice, the legal

13

advice privilege as we termed it in the brief, the

14

question is whether or not legal advice under the Turner

15

analysis, or whether or not the prison's disciplinary

16

policy under the Turner analysis is reasonably related to

17

a legitimate penalogical interest, and we believe it is.

18

Once that determination has been made, that the

19

policy is valid and, in fact, the respondent has conceded

20

that, he's not contested the facial validity of that

21

policy, but once the validity of that policy under Turner

22

is determined, then the only question, we believe, is

23

whether or not Mr. Murphy in fact violated the policy and,

24

as I mentioned to Justice Scalia's question, he has not

25

raised that question, and that's a due process question
5

1

that was not raised below.

2

In Turner itself the court did not distinguish

3

between legal communications and other types of

4

communication between inmates, and there is no logical

5

reason why legal communication should be entitled to any

6

different standard of review than other types of speech,

7

including political speech.

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, suppose you have a prison

where, in a disciplinary proceeding, not a criminal charge

10

but a disciplinary proceeding, one inmate, as the custom,

11

often represents another.

12

inmate law clerk would have a privilege to communicate

13

with the inmate that he's representing?

14

Do you think then the so-called

It's maybe a little hard for you to answer,

15

because we have to assume a lot of regulations and stuff

16

that are not in play, but just to flat out say that

17

there's never this right is somewhat -- goes somewhat far,

18

I think.

19

MR. OHLER:

Well, in this case, and this case is

20

an example, perhaps, of the hypothetical you pose, but

21

Mr. Murphy had the opportunity in this case to communicate

22

to the Inmate Tracy.

23

advice that was contained in the letter, don't plead

24

guilty, have your attorney get a hold of me, I've got some

25

information.

He could have provided the legal

Inmate Murphy went beyond that and -6

1

QUESTION:

No, but my question is, does he have

2

a right to send the communication?

3

right at all, we don't have to get into insolence or

4

interpretation of the letter, there's just simply no

5

right, but I'm suggesting that in some instances there

6

might be.

7

MR. OHLER:

You say there's no

With respect to inmate-to-inmate

8

communications it's our position, no, that there is no

9

right for inmate-to-inmate communications.

10

QUESTION:

Even when one inmate's representing

11

another in, say, a grievance proceeding, or, pardon me, a

12

disciplinary proceeding?

13
14

MR. OHLER:

Not with respect to communication

under the Turner opinion, Your Honor.

15

QUESTION:

Well, if -- are you answering your

16

question limited simply to sending letters, or are you

17

saying that one inmate can be assigned to defend another,

18

and the prison may preclude all communication between them

19

of any sort whatsoever?

20
21

MR. OHLER:

Are you saying that?

No, Your Honor, we're not saying

that.

22

QUESTION:

Okay.

23

MR. OHLER:

No.

24

QUESTION:

25

So you're limiting it simply to

written -- your answer to Justice Kennedy is limited
7

1

simply to written statements?

2

MR. OHLER:

3

QUESTION:

Correct.
And you take the position, then, that

4

if an inmate were, by the prison, assigned to provide

5

legal assistance to another prisoner, that no written

6

communication could be sent from the one providing the

7

assistance to the other prisoner?

8
9

MR. OHLER:
be read that way.

Under Turner, I believe Turner can

Under the facts of this case, the only

10

thing that the prison was punishing was the insolent

11

language contained in the communication, and the prison in

12

this case did permit that communication to occur between

13

Inmate Murphy, who is a law clerk, and Inmate Tracy.

14

QUESTION:

What possible interest would the

15

prison have in prohibiting -- assuming you allowed an

16

inmate to provide legal services to another, which

17

sometimes I understand happens, what interest of the

18

prison is there in making sure that it is never done in

19

written form, which the prison can then read?

20

MR. OHLER:

With respect to an inmate law clerk

21

program, as occurred here --

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. OHLER:

24
25

Yes.
-- we permitted, the prison

permitted communications between -QUESTION:

But you just told me that you would
8

1

not allow any written communication, even though a law

2

clerk assignment had been made.

3

MR. OHLER:

I'm sorry, I may have -- I misspoke

4

or misunderstood.

5

to imply that with respect to inmate-to-inmate

6

correspondence, that communications could be prohibited by

7

a prison and, in Turner, in fact, the regulation at issue,

8

which was at the Lorenz Correctional Facility in Missouri,

9

as practiced at that particular prison, precluded legal

10
11
12
13

I was simply saying that Turner seemed

communications, and -QUESTION:

Well, you don't have to go that far

in this case, nor do we.
I mean, really, all you're asserting in this

14

case is that normal prison regulations, including those

15

against displaying insolence towards the prison guards, do

16

not become suspended when there are communications

17

involving legal representation.

18

would have to go in order to give you all that you're

19

interested in here?

20

MR. OHLER:

21

QUESTION:

Isn't that as far as we

That is correct, Justice Scalia.
Well, I'm slightly mixed up, because

22

I thought, suppose that Inmate A wants to represent Inmate

23

B, but he isn't.

24

case, and there's no special right to be a lawyer.

25

don't have a constitutional right to get to be a lawyer,

I thought you were saying that's this

9

You

1

any more than you get to be an architect, right?

2

MR. OHLER:

3

QUESTION:

Correct.
But there's a different situation.

4

is representing B.

5

legal representation, which may involve sending letters.

6

Is that right?

7
8

A

MR. OHLER:

In that case, B, not A, has a right to

If we're going to term the

communication that occurred here as representation --

9

QUESTION:

This has nothing to do with that, I

10

thought.

Am I not right that A is not representing B in

11

this case, he'd just like to?

12

MR. OHLER:

13

QUESTION:

That's correct, yes.
All right.

So if we're writing an

14

opinion, I guess, shouldn't I be careful, drawing on your

15

personal view, not some case but your view as a lawyer, to

16

make certain that we don't say, we don't talk about the

17

situation where B, who is the person who needs a lawyer,

18

he may well have a right to get communications from his

19

lawyer that is different from the ordinary right just to

20

speak.

Am I right?

21

MR. OHLER:

22

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Okay.

Now, what about the case where

23

we have an association of people who help to provide

24

lawyers to inmates?

25

I'm obviously thinking of NAACP v. Button, for
10

1

example, and maybe that association of lawyers, or people

2

who want to give lawyers to inmates, has a few inmates in

3

it.

Might they have a special right?

4

MR. OHLER:

5

QUESTION:

6

get into that here?

7

MR. OHLER:

Your Honor, with respect to -Do you want to say we don't have to

I don't think we have to get into

8

that.

9

of cases dealt with access to courts.

10

I think the NAACP cases and the In re Primus line

In fact, I think this Court used that language

11

in the Primus case, dealt with access to courts by free

12

citizens, and providing free citizens with the tools to

13

gain a foothold into the court and to advance their civil

14

rights, and there is a large amount of jurisprudence from

15

this Court relative to the right of access as it applies

16

to inmates, and we believe that that jurisprudence

17

controls, relative to the right of access by inmates in a

18

prison setting.

19

QUESTION:

Would it have been the same offense,

20

in your view, if the -- was it Murphy, had sent the letter

21

not to Tracy but to Tracy's assigned counsel?

22

MR. OHLER:

That would be another matter and, in

23

fact, that correspondence could have occurred, and the

24

difference between that situation and the situation that's

25

presented in this case is the correspondence that is going
11

1

outside the prison, and so it's -- the confrontational

2

aspect of Inmate Murphy's letter is not the same, because

3

it's being sent outside the prison.

4
5

QUESTION:

Suppose it were sent to an

investigative reporter?

6

MR. OHLER:

That would have been fine.

Once

7

again, we don't have that confrontational aspect that

8

occurred when this correspondence remained within the

9

prison.

10

QUESTION:

Well, in both of Justice Ginsburg's

11

hypotheticals, I assume the prison authorities would read

12

the letter first, or am I wrong about that?

13

hypothetical, but I assume -- that's your regulation.

14

Don't you read everything that goes out?

15
16

MR. OHLER:

Our policy permits outgoing

correspondence to go out, and is only --

17
18

No.

It's a

QUESTION:

Whether or not it's read.

It's not

read?

19

MR. OHLER:

It's only read if there's a

20

reasonable probability to believe that it contains certain

21

types of information that would be detrimental to the

22

prison, so in most cases outgoing correspondence is not

23

read.

24
25

QUESTION:
talking about?

What is the confrontation that you're

I may not understand what you mean.
12

1

MR. OHLER:

2

QUESTION:

3

aspect.

You spoke about confrontational

What do you mean by that?

4
5

Well --

MR. OHLER:

The language contained in the letter

was disparaging about Correctional Officer Galle.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. OHLER:

Yes.
And it was a challenge to the

8

authority of Correctional Officer Galle in particular,

9

but correctional staff in general, and it's that --

10

QUESTION:

Well, it was a challenge to his

11

exercise, or as the letter claimed, his abuse of

12

authority.

13

MR. OHLER:

Correct, and there were also other

14

comments in there concerning his sexual orientation which

15

this Court I believe in Thornburgh recognized as a

16

security concern in the prison context.

17

QUESTION:

Right.

What's the confrontation?

18

Are you talking about the confrontation between the person

19

who writes the letter and the prison censor who reads it?

20

MR. OHLER:

No.

I think the confrontational

21

aspect of that, and the challenge to authority, goes

22

between Inmate Murphy and Officer Galle.

23

QUESTION:

Well, Officer Galle never saw the

24

letter, could not have been, I take it, expected to see

25

the letter.

The only person who could be expected to see
13

1

the letter, other than the recipient, was the prison

2

censor.

3

MR. OHLER:

The problem is, we don't know what

4

happens to the letter once it gets -- assuming that the

5

letter was transmitted to Inmate Tracy, that letter could

6

have been --

7
8

QUESTION:

Yes, but you're talking about the

confrontational aspect of the letter.

9

QUESTION:

I thought you meant that it

10

encourages the recipient to become confrontational with

11

the guards.

12

MR. OHLER:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. OHLER:

15

QUESTION:

It does that also, Your Honor.
It does that also?
Yes.
Oh.

But that's not what you meant by

16

its confrontational aspect.

17

perplexity.

18

Then I share Justice Souter's

I don't understand who he's confronting.

I mean, I can understand how it's not good for

19

prison discipline to allow prisoners to incite one another

20

against the guards.

21

it makes sense, but how one letter from one prisoner to

22

another prisoner confronts the prison guards, that's

23

beyond me.

24
25

MR. OHLER:

If that's what you're talking about,

And that's one aspect of it, and

that is a concern, is that in fact this particular inmate
14

1

that the letter was sent to had just recently assaulted a

2

correctional officer.

3

Inmate Tracy.

4
5

This letter would tend to incite

The other concern is what this Court termed a
ripple effect when --

6

QUESTION:

More so than if his lawyer had told

7

him, his lawyer said, I got this letter from a fellow

8

inmate, what do you think of it, or if an investigative

9

reporter asked him?

10

less of a problem?

11
12

MR. OHLER:

QUESTION:

You have no control over the lawyers,

I take it.

15

MR. OHLER:

16

QUESTION:

17

There are -- there still are

concerns there, Justice --

13
14

Would it be less -- would that be

That's correct.
You do have control over the

prisoners.

18

MR. OHLER:

QUESTION:

MR. OHLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve my

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA MILLETT

2

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

3

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

4
5
6

MS. MILLETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The court of appeals' categorical protection of

7

inmate legal advice from rules that reasonably regulate

8

all other prison correspondence is inconsistent both with

9

this Court's precedents and with realities of prison

10

management.

11

view, prisoners have a right of access to the courts to

12

press their own grievances and claims, but this Court has

13

never recognized a freestanding First Amendment right on

14

the part of other inmates to get involved in each others'

15

litigation efforts.

16

litigating inmate is already represented by an attorney.

17

In our view prisoners -- and in this Court's

That is particularly true when the

In Lewis v. Casey, this Court held that while

18

inmates must be allowed to bring suits challenging their

19

own convictions and conditions of confinement, impairment

20

of any other litigating capacity, and that would include

21

serving as a legal advisor, is simply going to be

22

incidental and perfectly constitutional consequences of

23

conviction and incarceration.

24

QUESTION:

25

Ms. Millett, will you clarify for us

what the United States would remand?
16

What would be open

1

to the court below to consider, assuming we accept your

2

first position that there is no right of, to represent --

3

one inmate to another to represent each other?

4

attorney-client relationship that stems from any

5

constitutional guarantee.

6

would you remand on?

7

MS. MILLETT:

There's no

Let's say we accept that.

What

The remand would be on an as-

8

applied challenge to this particular communication.

It

9

would not be a request, as the Ninth Circuit found here,

10

for categorical protection of all inmate communications of

11

legal advice.

12

of the insolence regulation to this particular

13

communication, looking at its particular content, would be

14

consistent with the First Amendment under a --

15
16
17

The question would be whether application

QUESTION:

But am I wrong, or was the petitioner

wrong in suggesting that that had not been raised?
MS. MILLETT:

Well, our understanding is that

18

what was not raised is whether or not this communication

19

fell within the definition of insolence or violation of a

20

due process, or interference with a due process hearing

21

under the terms of the regulations, and that's not what

22

we're saying should be remanded.

23

be remanded is whether there's an as-applied

24

constitutional challenge to application of those

25

regulations to this communication.
17

What we're saying should

1

QUESTION:

Which would be based on that same

2

thing.

3

based on unless it is the fact that in fact this

4

regulation wasn't violated?

5

I mean, what would an as-applied challenge be

MS. MILLETT:

No, you could have -- prisons

6

could have a regulation.

7

that insolence could includes any, for example, criticism

8

of a guard, so that -- and those might well pass facial

9

constitutionality under a Turner v. Safley analysis, but

10

you could still find that a comment to a guard that, you

11

know, that's a bad hair cut, would fall within the meaning

12

of insolence, and so would fall within the regulation, but

13

would not survive a Turner v. Safley as-applied analysis

14

because it would not be a security --

15

QUESTION:

For example, they could decide

Are you suggesting that there are two

16

levels of application of Turner, that even if a regulation

17

on its face, so to speak, is valid under Turner, it could

18

be invalid as applied?

19

MS. MILLETT:

Absolutely, and I think that's

20

what -- for example, in Thornburgh v. Abbott this Court

21

upheld regulations as applied to the public generally --

22

I'm sorry, not as applied, facially, the application of a

23

prison regulation limiting the types of publications and

24

magazines that could come into a prison, but remanded for

25

as-applied review of whether publication by publication
18

1

the prison's decision to keep a particular publication out

2

violated the First Amendment, and that's all that we think

3

the remand here would need to encompass.

4

important thing to keep in mind, and the main problem with

5

the Ninth Circuit --

6

QUESTION:

7

MS. MILLETT:

But the

Did he raise that question below?
That's our understanding of the

8

complaint, and it's based in part on the magistrate

9

judge's analysis which is in the petition appendix, where

10

they talk about the failure of the State to come forward

11

at that stage with information showing why this particular

12

communication was a threat to security.

13

QUESTION:

Well, I take it --

14

QUESTION:

So in your view there is --

15

QUESTION:

-- that is going to whether the

16

regulation was violated, whether this particular

17

communication was, indeed, insolence towards the guard.

18

Isn't that perfectly explicable as raising the issue of

19

whether the regulation was violated?

20

MS. MILLETT:

Well, we understood that argument

21

in the complaint, that analysis by the magistrate judge

22

and respondent's, including respondent's arguments here

23

about whether, you know, how this particular communication

24

does or does not challenge security interests as an as-

25

applied challenge, but we're not here because we have a
19

1

strong interest on that.

2

record, and there is no as-applied challenge in the case,

3

then there would be no basis for a remand.

4

QUESTION:

If we've misunderstood the

Is another way of saying what you're

5

trying -- maybe I don't quite get it, that even though he

6

doesn't have a First Amendment right to act as a lawyer

7

and practice law in the prison context, he had a First

8

Amendment right to write this particular letter?

9

MS. MILLETT:

Yes.

Well, our position is that

10

there's no special First Amendment status accorded to this

11

communication because it was legal advice.

12

QUESTION:

13

Amendment review --

14

Right, but just under ordinary First

MS. MILLETT:

Exactly.

Exactly.

That -- the

15

crux of our point is that Turner v. Safley is a sufficient

16

test to review all prison regulations, and --

17

QUESTION:

In your view there's a First

18

Amendment right for prisoners to communicate with each

19

other?

20

point, based on my understanding of your argument.

21

I mean, does -- that has to be the beginning

MS. MILLETT:

Well, our position is that inmates

22

could always claim that and then the burden would be on

23

the prison to show in the circumstances that there is or

24

is not.

25

For most of the time there's a lot of prisoner
20

1

communication that goes on that does not affect prison

2

security.

3

QUESTION:

But that's a very substantial

5

QUESTION:

Yes.

6

QUESTION:

You're asking us to have a

4

holding.

7

foundational proposition that there's a First Amendment

8

right for prisoners to communicate.

9

QUESTION:

10

We've never held that.

MS. MILLETT:

The -- I think the premise of the

11

recognition that you read would be reviewed under Turner

12

v. Safley, and I think a regulation that said, prisoners

13

shall never, under all circumstances shall never speak to

14

another inmate, no inmate shall ever speak to another

15

inmate, would have to be reviewed under Turner v. Safley,

16

and the Government would have to come in and show why any

17

communication at all between inmates is a threat to

18

security.

19

QUESTION:

There's another point, too, that if

20

the prison regulations do permit communication, there is

21

still -- there arguably could be a First Amendment right

22

to say certain things in those communications without --

23

in other words, they say, we'll let you write letters, but

24

we're going to tell you exactly what you can say.

25

a rather strange view.

Well, anyway -21

That's

1

MS. MILLETT:

I'm sorry if I misunderstood your

2

question.

3

be circumstances, in fact, in which it would be

4

appropriate for a prison to say, there shall be no

5

communications at all between inmates, either curfew

6

times, or lockdown situations, or high security --

7

Our only position is that there certainly may

QUESTION:

Well, I thought this involved such a

8

situation.

The person to whom respondent wanted to

9

communicate was in a maximum security section.

10

MS. MILLETT:

11

QUESTION:

He was.

And I had understood the prison did

12

not permit communication from prisoners in other parts of

13

the prison with lesser restrictions to prisoners in the

14

maximum security.

15

Am I wrong?

MS. MILLETT:

Our understanding is that he was

16

allowed to write a letter to this inmate, so there was not

17

a complete ban on communication between people, inmates in

18

respondent's category and this high risk, or this maximum

19

security unit.

20

communications.

21

There was not a complete ban on
It was just the content of this letter.

Clearly, any communication that is written

22

between prisoners must be consistent with valid

23

penalogical limitations on those, and those would include

24

that communications not be insolent or incite one inmate

25

against another, inmate against another or against guards
22

1
2

or prison staff.
The important thing, we think, to keep in mind

3

with respect to the Ninth Circuit's rule is that the

4

Turner v. Safley test is sufficient for purposes of

5

analyzing any First Amendment claims to speech or other

6

rights invoked by prisoners and that beyond that, prison

7

correspondence involving legal advice does not have any

8

special exemption from those rules, should not be analyzed

9

under any separate standard and, in fact, can present the

10

exact same dangers that routine correspondence does.

11

They can -- according special status, as the

12

Ninth Circuit has done, to inmate correspondence could

13

allow that type of correspondence to become a ready

14

vehicle for secretly coded communications and other

15

illicit communications.

16

a menace to prison discipline, and they could be allowed

17

through special treatment to set up an order or a

18

hierarchy that would compete with the prison order system.

19

Jailhouse lawyers are frequently

In addition, the circulation among inmates of

20

potentially volatile allegations and accusations can, in

21

the judgment of prison officials, exacerbate the already

22

extremely tense relations between prison officials and

23

inmates and that, much like in Jones v. North Carolina

24

Prisoners Labor Union, where this Court held that prisoner

25

communications, prisoner assertions of First Amendment
23

1

speech and association rights that are focused on

2

encouraging an increase in adversarial relations between

3

prison and staff can be regulated and restricted

4

consistent with legitimate penalogical objectives.

5

And finally, it's important to keep in mind that

6

there are ample alternative channels for inmates to

7

communicate information bearing on a case. They can

8

communicate with attorneys, Government officials, courts

9

and other members of the public.

They may bring their own

10

grievances or lawsuits.

The appropriate analysis, we

11

think, is Turner v. Safley and, beyond that, the -- to the

12

extent someone is concerned about information getting into

13

courts.

Thank you.

14

QUESTION:

Thank you, Ms. Millett.

15

Mr. Renz, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY T. RENZ

17

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18
19
20

MR. RENZ:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
It appears to me that the State prison here is

21

proposing a change in the Turner rule which the Turner

22

opinion does not accommodate.

23

position, so long as their rules are neutrally drawn, and

24

so long as the rules on their face satisfy Turner, then

25

they are free to apply them in any manner in which they
24

As I understand the State's

1

deem fit.

2

think that Turner nor Abbott contemplate that.

3

I don't think that Turner says that.

I don't

This is an as-applied case, it was an as-

4

applied case, and it always has been an as-applied case,

5

with the single exception that Mr. Murphy challenged the

6

rules on their face as vague, and the vagueness issue, the

7

facial vagueness issue is not before this Court.

8

case is strictly about punishment of content of speech.

9

This

I think there are several issues here that are

10

not in dispute.

outside the prison, is without question protected by the

12

First Amendment.

13

within the prison.

14

under the prison's regulations to write to Mr. Tracy.

15

third, if these two things are true, as they are, then

16

Turner and Abbott provide the analytical framework for

17

this case.

18

First, this is speech that, if uttered

Second, this communication was permitted

QUESTION:

That is, Mr. Murphy was permitted

Well, I thought the Ninth Circuit

19

articulated at least some freestanding First Amendment

20

right of a fellow prisoner to offer legal advice to

21

another prisoner.

22

effect in its opinion.

23
24
25

And

MR. RENZ:

At least there's language to that

I think that the language in the

Ninth Circuit's opinion -QUESTION:

Do you defend that as a proposition
25

1

here?

2

MR. RENZ:

Well, I would contend, Your Honor,

3

that the Ninth Circuit was being somewhat circular when

4

they said that the prison's emphasis is at a low edge, ebb

5

when the language is legal advice.

6

QUESTION:

No, but --

7

QUESTION:

Well, do you contend -- excuse me.

8

Do you contend that the prisoner has a freestanding First

9

Amendment right to offer legal advice to another prisoner?

10

MR. RENZ:

No.

No, we do not contend that.

11

QUESTION:

But that's the only --

12

QUESTION:

The question presented.

13

QUESTION:

That's the question that was

14

presented.

15

That's the question in the blue brief.

16

the case.

17

Justice O'Connor put the question to you.

MR. RENZ:

That's the end of

That's not the end of the case, Your

18

Honor.

19

judgment of the Ninth Circuit on any grounds that appear

20

in the record.

21
22
23
24
25

I'm the respondent, and this Court may affirm the

QUESTION:

Well, but I mean, this is the

question that we're interested in.
MR. RENZ:

Yes, but this in my view is a

straightforward Turner application.
QUESTION:

Well, but do you have an answer?
26

Are

1

you saying that you agree that the question presented,

2

does the First Amendment of the United States Constitution

3

grant a State prison inmate an independent right to assist

4

another State prison inmate, do you agree that that is not

5

a correct statement of the law?

6

MR. RENZ:

I would agree with that, yes, but

7

what we have here is, we have a communication permitted by

8

the prison that contained information and contained legal

9

advice, and Mr. Murphy was punished for what he said.

He

10

was punished for what he said and the prison has never,

11

ever stated why that punishment advanced the interests it

12

articulates.

13

its articulated interests and the punishment of

14

Mr. Murphy, and that is exactly what Turner and Abbott

15

require.

16

It has never shown the connection between

That has never happened here.
QUESTION:

Mr. Renz, would you clarify -- what

17

we were told before was that you had waived all of that,

18

that you were not contesting the disciplinary action that

19

was taken against him.

20

was your position.

I think that's what we were told

21

MR. RENZ:

I'm not sure --

22

QUESTION:

We were told that you were not

23
24
25

contesting the disciplinary action that was taken.
MR. RENZ:

If the question is whether we are

seeking relief to purge the discipline, that's right.
27

1
2

QUESTION:

Well then, what sort of relief are

you seeking?

3

MR. RENZ:

We're seeking declaratory relief,

4

Your Honor, that says the prison may not do this without

5

demonstrating some sort of connection between its

6

interests and what it has done.

7

Mr. Murphy.

8
9

QUESTION:
the punishment.

Remember, it has punished

But you said you're not challenging

That's what's so odd about this.

The

10

reference -- Murphy does not seek expungement of his

11

record, the record, I take it, being the record of his

12

discipline.

13

MR. RENZ:

That's correct, Your Honor.

14

QUESTION:

Well, if you're not challenging that,

15

then I don't understand what interest you have in an

16

abstract statement of what the law should be in another

17

case.

18

MR. RENZ:

19

imprisoned.

20

prisoners.

21

prospective relief.

22

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Murphy continues to be

He continues to give legal advice for the
He's seeking, and sought in this lawsuit

But that's -- I think what's

23

bothering us is, we understand that there very well may

24

properly be requests for declaratory relief of a general

25

sort, but what you're seeking here apparently isn't
28

1

declaratory relief as a general sort.

2

that an as-applied challenge, this challenge, this

3

communication, this instance only, is valid because

4

there's a First Amendment violation, and yet with respect

5

to this specific instance you're not asking for any

6

relief.

7

categories of litigable issues.

8

It's a declaration

It doesn't seem to fit into any of our recognized

MR. RENZ:

I think I understand the question.

9

Mr. Murphy wants to continue giving legal advice without

10

the fear of sanctions, and a declaration that the prison

11

may not do this without demonstrating some connection

12

between its punishment and the interests it articulates --

13

QUESTION:

Okay, but is -- I'm sorry.

I was

14

going to say, as a general proposition, you've already got

15

that in Turner and Safley, and you either want something

16

specific to this case, though without any relief in this

17

particular case, or you want something broader, and when

18

you state what the broader relief is that you might want,

19

it seems to be about the same level of generality as

20

Turner and Safley itself, so we're stuck as to what we can

21

do for you --

22

MR. RENZ:

I see.

23

QUESTION:

-- even if we accept your position.

24

MR. RENZ:

The -- let me catch up.

25

Murphy wrote this letter.

The -- Mr.

He said these words.
29

He wants

1

to continue to be able to say these words without fear of

2

sanction.

3

these words without showing us more means that he is armed

4

with something in the future when the prison comes to him

5

and says --

Saying to the prison that you may not punish

6

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Renz, you say he wants to

7

continue to say these words, but I take it you don't mean

8

exactly these words.

9

exactly the same incidents if he wants to write to another

10

inmate.

I mean, he's not going to report

You mean, a letter like this?

11

MR. RENZ:

A letter like this.

Remember, the

12

prison has acted to apply its rules in a certain way.

13

It's extended the scope of its rule to encompass this kind

14

of speech.

15

they show a connection between its interests and the

16

extension of the rule and the punishment of Mr. Murphy,

17

but they haven't done that here.

18

Now, the prison is free to do that so long as

QUESTION:

Well, if you say that you're in

19

agreement that there's no special right to render legal

20

advice, then all this is is a question whether or not this

21

communication, or other communications like them, can, for

22

general purposes be suppressed, and the fact that he wants

23

to give legal advice, he doesn't have a right to do that.

24

MR. RENZ:

I think that's --

25

QUESTION:

I just don't know what -- this is
30

1

just a routine prison disciplinary case once you concede

2

the main proposition on which we granted the case.

3

MR. RENZ:

Well, he certainly has no special

4

right.

I mean, he was hired and retained as a legal

5

clerk.

He was under the practices of the prison permitted

6

to communicate and assist Mr. Murphy, even though

7

Mr. Murphy may have had counsel.

8
9

But the question here is whether he can be
punished by the prison for his communication, and the

10

prison has taken a rule, expanded its scope to encompass

11

Mr. Murphy's speech, and they've not articulated a basis

12

for it.

13

QUESTION:

Turner v. Safley dealt with a

14

constitutional right, I mean, you know, the right to

15

marry, and you know, rested on the proposition that it is

16

settled that a prison inmate retains those constitutional

17

rights that are not inconsistent with his status as a

18

prisoner.

19

constitutional right to provide legal advice to another

20

prisoner, which was the question presented, how does

21

Turner v. Safley come into play?

22

Once you've acknowledged that there is no

MR. RENZ:

Well, I disagree with your statement,

23

Justice Scalia.

There is a constitutional right to

24

provide advice to another prisoner.

25

whether it survives a Turner analysis.
31

The question is
In this case, it

1

survives the Turner analysis.

2

QUESTION:

Now you have me confused.

I thought

3

you acknowledged, in response to Justice O'Connor, that

4

there is no constitutional right to assist another State

5

prison inmate with a pending court case.

6

MR. RENZ:

As I understood Justice O'Connor's

7

question, it was whether or not there was a special, sort

8

of elevated right, and I would have to agree --

9

QUESTION:

A freestanding First Amendment right

10

to represent another prisoner, and I thought you told me

11

no, there is not, that you did not defend --

12

MR. RENZ:

Then --

13

QUESTION:

-- what it was the Ninth Circuit

14

panel said.

15
16

MR. RENZ:

Then, Justice O'Connor, I apologize,

because I misunderstood your question.

17

QUESTION:

If --

Well, are you defending the Ninth

18

Circuit, or are you not?

Do you adopt their reasoning,

19

and are you prepared to defend it?

20

MR. RENZ:

I'm prepared to defend it.

If we --

21

QUESTION:

Let's rephrase that, because I read

22

the question to you before and I thought I got a different

23

answer.

24

this thing.

25

Let's make absolutely sure where you stand on

The question presented is, does the First
32

1

Amendment to the United States Constitution grant a State

2

prison inmate an independent and freestanding right to

3

assist another State prison inmate with a pending court

4

case even if the State supplies other forms of legal

5

assistance to the prison inmate?

6
7

Now, is that a correct statement of the law or
an incorrect statement of the law?

8
9

MR. RENZ:

I -- as I construe it, I think it's a

fair statement, and that is that were Mr. Murphy outside

10

the prison, he would have an independent and freestanding

11

right --

12

QUESTION:

But he's inside the prison.

13

MR. RENZ:

That's correct, and once he is inside

14

the prison we then engage in the Turner analysis.

15

sure if --

16

QUESTION:

I'm at a loss to --

17

MR. RENZ:

I'm at a loss, too.

I'm not

If we take --

18

what I'm saying is that we don't have an independent

19

freestanding right that survives, or stands outside of

20

Turner.

21
22
23
24
25

I think that is a correct statement.
QUESTION:

Well then you really don't defend the

Ninth Circuit's decision.
MR. RENZ:

To the extent that they create a

right outside of Turner -QUESTION:

Okay.
33

1
2
3

MR. RENZ:

-- but they didn't do that.

They

engaged in a straightforward Turner analysis.
QUESTION:

They did have a whole paragraph

4

where -- I thought a whole paragraph where the Ninth

5

Circuit says there's a special right that every prisoner

6

has to represent other prisoners.

7

appendix page 9 here.

8

Murphy implicates the First Amendment right recognized by

9

this Court in Rizzo, where we held the provision of legal

I mean, it's on -- it's

It says, the prison discipline of

10

assistance to fellow inmates is an activity protected by

11

the First Amendment.

12

sister circuits have refused to recognize a constitutional

13

right to assist others.

And then they said, several of our

14

MR. RENZ:

Yes.

15

QUESTION:

It's not a right to get assistance.

16

It's a right to assist others.

17

constitutional right to be a lawyer.

Everybody has a

18

MR. RENZ:

Justice Breyer, that's right.

19

QUESTION:

That's how I read it.

20

MR. RENZ:

That's right.

21

QUESTION:

I didn't know you had that right, and

22
23

I haven't seen it.
MR. RENZ:

But the holding in Rizzo was, Rizzo

24

was a retaliation case decided at the pleadings stage, and

25

in that case the prisoner was free to assist other
34

1

prisoners in his particular prison.

2

QUESTION:

Do you think there is a separate,

3

freestanding right to assist others in pressing legal

4

claims?

5

talking about B's right to get assistance.

6

about A's right to go to somebody and say, I want to

7

represent you.

8

freestanding, First Amendment right to do that?

That's where A wants to represent B.

I'm not

I'm talking

Do you think there's a special,

9

MR. RENZ:

To provide assistance?

10

QUESTION:

Yes.

11

MR. RENZ:

Not outside of Turner.

12

QUESTION:

Oh, I mean -- all right.

I didn't

13

read Turner recently, so don't say not outside of Turner.

14

Just say yes or no.

15

MR. RENZ:

16

Well, yes, there is in the sense that

we have the same kind of right outside of prison.

17

QUESTION:

Is there?

I didn't know there was.

18

I mean, everyone has a right to go assist other people as

19

a lawyer?

20
21
22

MR. RENZ:

Not as a lawyer, Your Honor, but of

QUESTION:

Do you have -- what is there, a

course --

special First Amendment right to be a lawyer?

24

know what it is.

25

MR. RENZ:

Well, if -35

I don't

I'm not saying there isn't one.

2

MR. RENZ:

Oh, no, I understand.

3

QUESTION:

I'm just saying I'm not familiar with

MR. RENZ:

If the Brotherhood of Trainmen can

4

it.

5
6

send a union secretary to another trainman and say, don't

7

settle this case, go see this lawyer, and that is

8

protected under the First Amendment --

QUESTION:

You mean, there's a special First

10

Amendment right to do that?

11

just haven't seen it.

12

with it.

13
14
15

I mean, maybe there is.

I don't know.

I

I'm not familiar

What case -- is there a case that says that?
MR. RENZ:

It's the Brotherhood of Trainmen,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

And there you have a special right to

16

give somebody legal assistance that's different from your

17

ordinary First Amendment right?

18
19
20

MR. RENZ:

No, not different from the ordinary

First Amendment.
QUESTION:

You don't think that stemmed from

21

some labor union contract dealing with discipline of

22

employees and union members?

23

MR. RENZ:

24
25

I -- in terms of the right of

association?
QUESTION:

Right.
36

MR. RENZ:

I don't think necessarily because of

Primus and --

In the private world, outside the

labor contract, no labor union agreement, and you just

have a nonlawyer who wants to give legal advice to

somebody else.

right to give legal advice?

somebody?

Is there some freestanding First Amendment
You don't have to be a

You have some right to go give legal advice to

MR. RENZ:

I would suggest, Your Honor, that

11

the -- it depends upon what we call legal advice.

12

on the street can say, gee, you know, this car ran over

13

you, your case is worth a lot of money, you should go see

14

a lawyer.

15

sort of legal advice that we'd consider in terms of what

16

lawyers give.

That's legal advice, but it certainly isn't the

This is much the same character of the advice

18

that Murphy gave.

19

Mr. Galle.

20

on this.

21

Someone

Gee, I know about these things about

You should have your lawyer get a hold of me

QUESTION:

That sounds like somebody saying, I'm

22

a witness, a potential witness for you, but not that I

23

have a right to give you legal advice.

24
25

MR. RENZ:

And part of that communication from

Mr. Murphy said that exactly, Justice Ginsburg.
37

He said,

1

this happened to me, and that makes him a competent

2

witness.

3

QUESTION:

Well, it seems to me that you're

4

arguing for some kind of a right for somebody with

5

relevant information to convey it to someone who's in

6

trouble, but that's not the theory that the Ninth

7

Amendment, Ninth Circuit proceeded on, and I'm wondering

8

where they got it from.

9

argue that theory to the Ninth Circuit, that there is a

Did you

right of one person to represent another?

11

MR. RENZ:

I suspect that it may have come from

12

our argument in which we articulated that the prison has

13

no legitimate interest in regulating a communication that

14

is intended for a court outside the prison.

15

I don't see that specifically in the Ninth Circuit's

16

opinion.

17

QUESTION:

I can't say.

Would you object to an opinion from

18

us that says the following?

There are passages in the

19

Ninth Circuit's opinion that suggests there exists a

20

special, separate, freestanding right of a prisoner to

21

represent someone else, even if he doesn't want it, or

22

whatever.

23

the First Amendment applies to prisons as anywhere else,

24

and so we've written about that, so go back and consider

25

it.

We are not aware of any such right.

38

Of course,

MR. RENZ:

I think that's a fair statement of

the law, Justice Breyer.

3

QUESTION:

That's what you'd like?

4

MR. RENZ:

Yes.

5

QUESTION:

What about adding, and we're not

6

certain how you happen to be in Court, because there might

7

be a problem here of declaratory relief.

8

for in your complaint was a declaration that Rule 009 and

9

022 are too vague, and that this violated -- and that you

What you asked

10

can't have a policy in a prison which says content of a

11

letter is relevant to discipline.

12
13

MR. RENZ:

Well, now we're talking about

fashioning relief --

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

15

MR. RENZ:

-- and I think that's for the lower

QUESTION:

But you'd be happy to be thrown back

court.

into the briar patch, essentially, right?

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. RENZ:

21

thrown into the briar patch.

22

that the crafting of relief is something that needs to be

23

done.

24
25

I would not be objecting to being
I think it's fair to say

We haven't done that yet.
QUESTION:

Well, there are many other

imaginative solutions of this case that can be devised, I
39

1

suppose, and this would knock off one of them, anyway.

2

MR. RENZ:

I think so.

I mean, we're sort of

3

jumping down the road here when we talk about the form of

4

relief.

5

yet, and I think that we can do that.

6

I mean, the form of relief hasn't been crafted

QUESTION:

Mr. Renz, I don't want to invade your

7

attorney-client privilege or anything like that, so don't

8

answer the question if you think it's improper, but I'm

9

just very puzzled, how is it that you're not challenging

10

the discipline to your client, when you're challenging the

11

basis for the discipline?

12

MR. RENZ:

Well, as we read Edwards -- well,

13

Edwards hadn't been decided yet.

14

played Heck out it was argued that we were not in a

15

position to purge the sanction against him.

16

that --

QUESTION:

As we read Heck and

To the extent

But the sanction must have adverse

consequences for his future status in prison, doesn't it?

19

MR. RENZ:

That would be true, but an opinion

20

from the district court order of the Ninth Circuit that

21

said he was -- what he had done was protected by the

22

Constitution would certainly vitiate that.

Not if you're not asking to have it

It would still be on his record.
MR. RENZ:

It would be on his record, but -40

QUESTION:

I'm very puzzled.

I just don't

understand.

3

MR. RENZ:

-- the holding of the Court that what

4

he had done was protected by the Constitution and was

5

legal and permitted would also be before the parole board

6

or whoever might see that information.

7

QUESTION:

You could get it expunged later.

8

mean, this is a strange manner of litigating, that you

9

bring a declaratory judgment that something that's been

I

10

done to you was unlawful, and then bring a second suit to

11

undo what was done to you because it has been declared to

12

be unlawful.

13

the conditions for a declaratory judgment exist when it

14

is -- I mean, it is equitable relief, and I'm not sure a

15

court should provide it --

I don't understand it.

I'm not sure that

MR. RENZ:

Well, we also --

-- when there is available to you

legal relief that will give full satisfaction to your

client.

MR. RENZ:

We do seek conjunctive relief in this

case, Judge -- Justice -QUESTION:

Well, I understand that.

That's

equitable, but --

24

MR. RENZ:

Yes.

25

QUESTION:

-- I don't think that a court ought
41

1

to give that if you don't care enough about what's

2

happened to you to seek to have that undone.

3

understand that.

4

QUESTION:

I don't

Several years ago we held in a habeas

5

corpus case where the person sought declaratory relief,

6

also from the Ninth Circuit, incidentally, that when

7

there's a specific remedy provided you can't impose a

8

declaratory judgment on top of it.

9

MR. RENZ:

Uh-huh, but this Court also held in

10

Edwards v. Ballistock, and that was a prison discipline

11

case, that the correction of that prison discipline was

12

not something that was cognizable under section 1983.

13
14

If there are no further questions, I'll submit
the case.

Thank you, Mr. Renz.

Mr. Ohler, you have 4 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID L. OHLER

18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

19

21

MR. OHLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, I don't have any

rebuttal, but I would be happy to answer any questions.
QUESTION:

Would you respond to the last point?

22

Was there any manner in which this litigant could have

23

gotten the allegedly unlawful imposition of discipline

24

undone through the courts?

25

that could have been done?

Was there no means by which

42

1
2

MR. OHLER:

I believe that he could have sought

expungement of the disciplinary infraction.

3

QUESTION:

How would that proceed?

He'd

4

challenge it before the prison administration and, if it

5

was rejected by the prison administration, then he would

6

go where?

7

gone.

8

Surely the State court, I assume he could have

9

MR. OHLER:
court, yes.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. OHLER:

12

He could have gone to the State

And what about Federal court?
It seems to me that he could have

raised that in this particular case, Your Honor.

13

QUESTION:

What if he were now to go back to the

14

district court and ask to amend the complaint and say,

15

under my prayer for any other relief, or whatever the

16

language is, I would like to have this order expunged from

17

my record?

18

Would that be untimely?
MR. OHLER:

It seems to me it would be untimely,

19

Your Honor, but I don't have a firm answer with respect to

20

the law.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

22

The case is submitted.

23

(Whereupon, at 11:46 a.m., the case in the

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
