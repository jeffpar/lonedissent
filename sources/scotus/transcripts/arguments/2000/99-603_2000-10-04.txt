ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN LEVINE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER LEGAL SERVICE CORPORATION

11
12

Levine, Your Honor.

MR. LEVINE:

May it please the Court, Mr. Chief

Justice:
This is a case concerning Congress' power to

14

allocate dollars in the federally subsidized Legal

15

Services program for the categories of civil

16

representation that Congress has chosen to furnish.

17

the Rust v. Sullivan line of cases, it is Congress itself

18

that has the power to decide which policies or programs it

19

will promote.

20

namely the Legal Services lawyers, the grantees, or even

21

the clients, that have that power.

22

Under

It is not the participants in the program,

Here -- here, the Government is acting to

23

promote its policy of providing free legal services for

24

certain categories or types of civil representation, and

25

it is the lawyers who are delivering those services.
3

What

1

Congress did not do was create a Legal Services program to

2

promote diverse private expression by Legal Services

3

lawyers around the country.

4

In 1996, in response to criticism in Congress

5

that the Legal Services lawyers had veered off-course from

6

the program's original purpose by participating in

7

politicized and expensive litigations, a compromise

8

appropriations bill was enacted to limit the scope of the

9

kinds of civil representations that would be funded.

10

Specifically, Congress decided not to finance any longer,

11

litigation to amend or otherwise challenge the Federal or

12

State welfare reform system.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Levine, does the statute at issue

14

here in your view prohibit a Legal Aid attorney

15

representing an individual client from making a

16

constitutional challenge to the application of a

17

particular welfare law?

18

MR. LEVINE:

19

QUESTION:

20

There seems to be some dispute about

whether it does that, but you think that's clear?

21

MR. LEVINE:

22

QUESTION:

23

Yes.

Yes.
And if so I presume that it disables

him from undertaking representation in that case.

24

MR. LEVINE:

25

QUESTION:

That's correct.
And in fact, I take it, the same
4

1

prohibition applies if the law or regulation in question

2

is superseded by another Federal statute, or inconsistent

3

with the ADA, et cetera?

4

MR. LEVINE:

That's correct.

5

QUESTION:

What --

6

QUESTION:

May I ask a question about precisely

7

how that would operate?

8

who is funded by Legal Services Corporation and is going

9

to make just the argument that under existing law and

10
11

Let's assume we had an attorney

regulation the client should receive benefits.
That lawyer is joined by another lawyer who is

12

not Legal Services-funded, and that lawyer in the same

13

case, without using any Legal Service funds, urges, and

14

beyond that, the existing law, if it works to deny my

15

client benefits, it's unconstitutional.

16

In other words, I understand your answer so far,

17

that the Legal Services Corporation lawyer cannot present

18

arguments about existing law.

19

to what Congress says it will pay for, present that part

20

of the lawsuit while another lawyer not funded by Legal

21

Services argues questions of the consistency of the

22

regulation, of the statute, questions of the compatibility

23

of the statute with the Constitution?

24

MR. LEVINE:

25

QUESTION:

Can that lawyer, sticking

I would say no, Your Honor.
And what is it in the 504(a)(16) that
5

1

makes it clear that not only can the Legal Services lawyer

2

herself engage in such representation, but cannot team up

3

with a lawyer who is not under that disability?

4

MR. LEVINE:

Your Honor, your hypothetical would

5

have been that counsel would be co-counsel in one case on

6

behalf of an individual seeking to obtain benefits under

7

existing law and seeking to challenge --

8
9

QUESTION:

Making arguments lawyers make all the

time.

10

MR. LEVINE:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. LEVINE:

In the alternative.
Yes.
And the position of -- I think the

13

statute on its face is clear, that a lawyer could not

14

participate in a case in which there was a challenge to an

15

existing Federal or State welfare reform statute.

16

The -- Congress made a determination that it did

17

not want to participate in funding Legal Services for

18

efforts to challenge existing welfare reform statutes, and

19

in the program integrity guidelines that are set up, that

20

have been established pursuant to the statute to assure

21

the independence of an affiliate organization of a Legal

22

Services program, it is stressed in those regulations that

23

it's very important that the Legal Services offices funded

24

by Federal Legal Services be separate and distinct from

25

the other, and it seems to me -6

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. LEVINE:

Okay, I understand the --- and it seems to me that the

3

hypothetical that you're suggesting where two lawyers

4

essentially are co-counsel for one client, that the

5

arguments in the alternative offends that statute --

6

QUESTION:

Yes, okay, I think you've been very

7

clear on that.

You're saying the Legal Services attorney

8

cannot, in any way, shape, or manner, participate in a

9

lawsuit where anybody makes such a claim.

It's not just a

10

limitation on use of the funds of Legal Services

11

Corporation, but of the funds -- he just can't

12

participate.

13

MR. LEVINE:

14

QUESTION:

That's correct.
The other thing I would like just to

15

make clear on what is the factual background, or what are

16

the limits of this 504(a)(16).

17

Service-funded lawyer make the argument, court, you must

18

read the regulation and statute this way, because if you

19

don't, the regulation will be under a statutory cloud, or

20

the statute would be under a constitutional crowd --

21

cloud.

22

governing statute or regulation to avoid what the Legal

23

Services Corporation lawyer tells the court would be a

24

serious constitutional question?

25

Could a Legal

In other words, to urge interpretation of the

MR. LEVINE:

Well, it seems to me at the

1

beginning of the representation of an individual seeking

2

to obtain benefits under existing law, a Legal

3

Services-funded lawyer makes a determination whether he

4

can proceed in the category of case to just seek benefits

5

under the existing law, or whether the arguments that

6

would be made on behalf of his client would be in some

7

prohibited area, and if it's going to be in some

8

prohibited area --

9

QUESTION:

Well, I'm -- the question I'm asking

10

is, is it a prohibited area to say, the reason why I'm

11

urging this reading of the existing law is, it would be

12

under a constitutional cloud if you read it any other way?

13

MR. LEVINE:

Well, Your Honor, it seems to me

14

that the arguments that a Legal Services lawyer makes to

15

the court on behalf of his client are the permitted

16

arguments under the statute.

17

unless questioned by the court, ought to be raising with

18

the court a hypothetical argument that would be --

19

QUESTION:

I don't think a lawyer,

Not a hypothetical -- not a

20

hypothetical argument.

Very often, lawyers urge, and this

21

Court, and other Federal courts will say they're going to

22

read the statute a certain way to avoid a serious

23

constitutional question.

24

Brandeis has said it, it's been said many times since,

25

that you read statutes, if possible, to avoid a

Nothing abstract about it.

constitutional question.

argument within the ball park for Legal Services

Corporation?

4

MR. LEVINE:

So I'm asking, is that such an

It seems to me, Your Honor, in a

5

colloquy with the court with respect to a particular claim

6

for benefits under existing law, if a Legal Services

7

lawyer is asked questions that get into, if you will --

8
9
10

QUESTION:

Nothing so shy, just up front in the

briefs -MR. LEVINE:

Up front, that said -- the lawyer

11

ought to be saying to that court, if Your Honor wants to

12

pursue that line of inquiry, I can answer it here today --

13

QUESTION:

It's not a question -- it's not a

14

question by the judge.

15

principle of statutory construction, which is that you

16

avoid interpreting the statute a certain way if it would

17

lead to a serious constitutional issue, and we think it

18

would, says the lawyer.

19

MR. LEVINE:

The lawyer wants to put forward a

Is that prohibited?
It seems to me, Your Honor, that

20

the lawyer can't participate in litigation which is

21

seeking to amend or alter the --

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. LEVINE:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. LEVINE:

We know that.
-- statute.
We know that.
And so -9

1
2

QUESTION:

This is a matter of statutory

construction --

3

MR. LEVINE:

4

QUESTION:

The argument --- of statutory construction, that

5

you interpret it so as to avoid a serious constitutional

6

question.

7

MR. LEVINE:

It seems to me in explaining the

8

argument, you can make the argument that I am making this

9

argument under existing law so that the court doesn't have

10

to reach another argument that I would not be permitted to

11

make.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Levine, how could you possibly

13

represent a client adequately if you believe there is a

14

serious constitutional question if the statute is

15

interpreted a certain way, and you make that argument to

16

the court, but then you don't take the next step, which I

17

have never seen avoided, moreover, if you do interpret it

18

this way, it's unconstitutional?

19
20

I mean, if he's going to make that argument he
has to stay out of the case, doesn't he?

21

MR. LEVINE:

Yes.

22

QUESTION:

Okay.

23

QUESTION:

Then, here's the problem I have.

That's the answer.

24

When you say that, or when the policy says that the lawyer

25

can bring the case when it amounts to a claim under
10

1

existing law, I assumed that that meant law properly

2

interpreted, but now you seem to be saying in response to

3

Justice Scalia that if the only way one can reach in

4

effect a proper interpretation of law is to look at the

5

constitutional problem that would result if you see it any

6

other way than favorably to my client, the lawyer can't

7

make that argument --

8

MR. LEVINE:

9

QUESTION:

10

Well --- because the lawyer can't go to the

point that Justice Scalia just mentioned.

11

MR. LEVINE:

12

QUESTION:

It's -And it therefore seems to me that

13

your position is boiling down to saying that existing law

14

means whatever the law is, or only the law, as admitted or

15

stipulated to by the Government.

16

MR. LEVINE:

17

QUESTION:

Well, there are -Because the Government is saying,

18

well, we're denying benefits under existing law, and

19

you're saying, if existing law can only be properly

20

understood in relation to the constitutional risks, you

21

can't understand existing law in that way, which virtually

22

limits the right of the Government lawyer even more than I

23

thought he was going to do.

24
25

MR. LEVINE:

Your Honor, the statute permits a

Legal Services lawyer to assist a low income person obtain
11

1

benefits under existing law, and existing law under those

2

circumstances would be what the State welfare reform

3

statute and the regulations provide, and --

4

QUESTION:

But we don't know what -- there's a

5

question about what it does provide, and the argument on

6

avoiding constitutional difficulty is an argument about

7

what the law is, what the law should be understood to be,

8

and that argument, based on your answer to Justice Scalia,

9

is an argument that the lawyer apparently cannot make.

10

MR. LEVINE:

That lawyer cannot make that

11

argument, and he shouldn't take the case in the first

12

place.

13
14
15
16

The bulk of -QUESTION:

So that client has to accept the

interpretation of the local welfare office as the law.
MR. LEVINE:

Oh, no.

No, no.

That client would

go and get another lawyer with the assistance --

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. LEVINE:

-- unless he gets outside counsel --- with the assistance of the Legal

19

Services lawyer.

20

a determination that the case that ought to be brought is

21

one that would involve the issues that Justice Scalia has

22

said then the lawyer would say, my -- I can't --

23
24
25

If the Legal Services lawyer here makes

QUESTION:

Oh, I understand that, but all I'm

saying is -MR. LEVINE:

-- over -12

1

QUESTION:

-- if I understand your position,

2

then there is a category of arguments about what the law

3

is, what the law should be understood to be, that the

4

Legal Services lawyer cannot make.

5

MR. LEVINE:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. LEVINE:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

That's correct.
Yes.
The over -- well over -Is that some kind of viewpoint

discrimination?
MR. LEVINE:

No.

I mean, it's simply, Congress

11

is deciding to fund certain categories of welfare benefit

12

cases, and not other categories of cases.

13

QUESTION:

What about a Legal Services lawyer

14

under this statute making an argument that a regulation

15

issued by the agency is invalid under the statute?

16

MR. LEVINE:

That would not be permitted either.

17

That would be in the category of cases where Congress --

18

where Congress has decided that it will not permit

19

challenges to Federal or State welfare reform systems, and

20

the purpose, the purpose for this really makes sense.

21

At the same time that these funding -- that this

22

appropriations bill was enacted in 1996, Congress was

23

enacting the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity

24

statute, and in that statute Congress basically moved

25

responsibility for welfare reform from the Federal
13

1

Government to the State governments and invited the State

2

governments to develop the State welfare reform programs

3

different than had been done previously.

4

And at the same time, in the same Congress,

5

Congress said that at the same time that we are providing

6

this responsibility to the States, we are simply not going

7

to pay Federal Legal Services lawyers to get involved in

8

the litigation involving the mosaic and interplay of the

9

Federal and State welfare reform systems, and it made

10

perfect sense.

11

QUESTION:

12

Mr. Kneedler, we'll hear from you.

13
14
15
16
17

Thank you, Mr. Levine.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER UNITED STATES
MR. KNEEDLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
As this Court made clear in West v. Sullivan,

18

the Government -- when the Government appropriates funds

19

to establish a Government program it is entitled, within

20

quite broad limits, to define the scope of that program.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

23

Are there limits?
There are limits, and the

principal --

24

QUESTION:

And what are they?

25

MR. KNEEDLER:

The only situation in which this
14

1

Court has struck down a Government funding restriction on

2

viewpoint grounds was in the Rosenberger case, and in that

3

case, what the Court held is, there the university had

4

made funds available to encourage a broad diversity of

5

private expression and had created what this Court there

6

termed a public forum and reiterated in the NEA case

7

that --

8
9
10

QUESTION:

Well, in Rosenberger I do think that

the Government wasn't paying for the speaker, and here
it's paying for the speaker.

11

On the other hand, it seems to me unlike Rust,

12

in that the speech, the message, the communication that's

13

prohibited doesn't contradict the Government's purpose if

14

we say -- and I don't know if we can say, but if we were

15

to say that this was an unlimited forum of some kind, then

16

we have to ask whether or not this restriction is

17

reasonable, and I just don't see how it's reasonable for

18

the Government to restrict the presentation of a case on

19

important legal issues to the third branch.

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, Congress did not establish

21

the Legal Services Corporation and the program under it as

22

a public forum.

23

question is whether the Legal Services Corporation is a

24

forum.

25

in the Rosenberger case.

For purposes of forum analysis the

That is the program, because that was the program

15

1

It was the precise expression or activity that

2

was funded by, in that case, the university's activities,

3

and it -- what Congress did in the Legal Services Act was

4

to provide for the furnishing of a particular professional

5

service, just like in Rust, the particular professional

6

service that is not the full expression of ideas of the

7

sort that has been covered by this Court's free speech

8

cases, it is a professional service in which there are

9

submissions made to a body, either administrative or

10

judicial body, under structural, procedural and

11

substantive --

12
13
14

QUESTION:

It does carry down to free speech.

It's a petition to the Government.
MR. KNEEDLER:

It is, but as this Court said in

15

the Walters case and the Yorkline case, the First

16

Amendment really doesn't add anything to what has been the

17

traditional source of constitutional guidance in that

18

area, which has been the Due Process Clause.

19

QUESTION:

Well, but it does add something,

20

because given the fact, as Justice Kennedy has just

21

pointed out, given the limitations that this kind of forum

22

involve restrictions on relevance and so on, there still

23

is a speech, a central speech element in what's going on

24

here, and there is a general principle, I think, that when

25

the Government takes action to disfavor speech simply
16

1

because it disagrees with the Government, you're getting

2

just about to the molten core of the First Amendment.

3

And it would seem to me that because that's what

4

the policy does here, there would be a good reason for us

5

to say, we should not characterize this as simply the

6

Government paying for services.

7

it as a speech case, because there's something very risky

8

going on when the Government's policy in effect says, you

9

can't make an argument that disagrees with the Government.

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

11

QUESTION:

12
13

We ought to characterize

With all respect --

So that's what I think is extra here.

that's why I think this is not merely a due process case.
MR. KNEEDLER:

But there are many situations in

14

our legal system in which Congress has enacted laws that

15

favor one litigant over another, one sort of claim over

16

another, the furnishing --

17

QUESTION:

This isn't merely favoring.

This is

18

saying, in effect, you may not make the argument that the

19

Government is constitutionally wrong.

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

I think what Congress did

21

here was say that a lawyer may not take on that case to

22

begin with.

23

In other words --

QUESTION:

Well, yeah.

Then the result of that

24

is that the lawyer may take on the case insofar as it does

25

not involve a constitutional challenge, but insofar as it
17

1

involves or could reasonably involve a challenge to the

2

law as being a constitutional mistake, then the lawyer

3

cannot take on the case, which is another way of saying

4

the lawyer cannot, with the incentive of the Government

5

money, say that, or State money, say that.

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, any speech that would

7

happen in a courtroom first of all is not the lawyer's own

8

self-expression.

9

behalf of a client, and not as a public forum with a free

10

debate.

11

consequences.

The lawyer is advancing arguments on

The lawyer is making arguments that have legal

12

QUESTION:

Is the Government the client?

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

The Government is not the client,

14

but what the Government is, is, it is the Government that

15

established the program and, as this Court held in Rust,

16

that when the Government establishes a program, it is

17

entitled to encourage certain activities and not others,

18

and --

19

QUESTION:

Well, but we said in Forbes, the

20

public television case, that when the Government

21

established its forum you have to give certain discretion

22

to the immediate speaker to preserve the integrity of the

23

message.

24

preserved by excluding certain views.

25

is the argument, the argument is that the necessity is to

In that case, the integrity of the message was

18

Here, the necessity

1

add certain speech to preserve the integrity of the

2

message for the forum that's been created.

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

In Forbes it is possible to think

4

of what was going on there as a debate, and classically a

5

debate among candidates about political issues.

6

never thought in our legal system of a courtroom or

7

lawyers as engaging in a public policy or political

8

debate.

9

We have

They are -QUESTION:

Well, the terms of the debate by the

10

lawyer may not be political, but the lawyer's raising of

11

constitutional issues is normally a direct response to

12

what, in fact, is the result of a political debate.

13

you can't exclude, in effect, the significance of politics

14

from constitutional challenge.

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

So

No, but once the matter has been

16

reduced out of the lobbying or the political sphere into

17

the litigation sphere, we have a set of procedural and

18

substantive rules that have legal consequences.

19

complaint is filed in court, the other party must respond

20

and the court will enter a judgment.

21

QUESTION:

When a

Well, that's right, but if I may just

22

cut you short a little bit on that, those rules allow for

23

challenges to what are political determinations by the

24

Congress.

25

They allow challenges to political results.
MR. KNEEDLER:

If I could just go back to the
19

1

Rust case, what the Court said there, and it is very

2

similar, because it had to do with the furnishing of

3

particular services, and particular types of expression

4

were not permitted under that program.

5

QUESTION:

But it was Government expression.

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

the people that they counseled.

MR. KNEEDLER:

I don't think that's a fair

11

characterization of the program in Rust, and in fact the

12

respondents in this case concede that the Government was

13

not the speaker.

for counselors to exercise their professional judgment in

Congress said here.

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, may I ask you a

2

question about -- and you keep bringing up Rust, and it

3

seems to me that whatever else is wrong with this, it

4

fails the line that runs from Speiser v. Randolph.

5

is, what you're saying is not only can't you use the

6

Government's money to speak the speech, but you can't use

7

your private money to do it, and I thought in all those

8

cases, the lobbying cases, sure, we don't have to pay for

9

your lobbying, but we can't stop you from doing it with

10

That

your own money.

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

If I could make two responses to

12

that.

13

that the matching funds that were required under Title X

14

were also subject to the restrictions, and that's in

15

footnote 5 of the Rust decision.

16

First of all, in Rust itself, the Court recognized

But beyond that, what the Legal Services

17

Corporation provided for here is exactly what was provided

18

for in Rust, which was allowing the recipient to set up a

19

separate entity to engage in the activities that could not

20

be engaged in by the recipient itself.

21
22
23

The LSC regulations were patterned directly
after the regulations in Rust, and -QUESTION:

And so the same lawyer could present

24

this -- the argument without any inhibition, using the

25

counterpart organization.
21

1

MR. KNEEDLER:

The -- it would -- the matter

2

would have to be presented by the counterpart

3

organization.

4

Now, if the -- if the lawyer involved was a

5

part-time lawyer with the Legal Services-funded recipient,

6

and worked separately for the other entity, and there was

7

the requisite separation of functions, yes, that lawyer

8

could present the arguments, assuming that the separation

9

requirements were met in the other program.

10

But that -- what the Legal Services Corporation

11

did here is consistent with the Regan decision, with

12

League of Women Voters, and most significantly with Rust,

13

in providing for that private expression.

14

that's to allow for the recipient's private expression,

15

the association's private expression.

16

But of course,

Here, I think it's also important to bear in

17

mind that the vast majority of the funds, non-LSC funds

18

that are received, are also public funds, the IOLTA funds,

19

the State funds, so we're not talking about an entity that

20

has a large amount of private funds of the sort a typical

21

private association would have.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BURT NEUBORNE

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

13
14

Mr.

Neuborne, we'll hear from you.

10

12

I

MR. NEUBORNE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The principal legal issue before the Court this

15

morning is narrow and precisely tailored.

16

choose to provide Federal subsidies to a broad array of

17

private lawyers in order to commit them to represent poor

18

clients in litigation in a particular area of the law, in

19

this case welfare law, but forbid the subsidized lawyers

20

from using the Federal funds to raise any argument in

21

court which seeks to challenge or amend existing law, for

22

the extraordinary sweep that the Legal Services

23

Corporation has conceded that those words are to be given.

24
25

May Congress

In short, may Congress condition a subsidy to a
lawyer for the poor on an explicit requirement that the
23

1

subsidized lawyer argue only in favor of enforcing the

2

legal status quo as that is defined by the last regulation

3

to be issued down the legal chain, and not challenging in

4

any way, by raising its constitutionality, its

5

insufficiency to follow statutes, or its inappropriate

6

construction and creation -- yes, sir.

7

QUESTION:

You can put it that way, but you can

8

just as readily put it, may the Government fund

9

representation in cases that raise certain issues and not

10

fund representation in cases that involve other issues.

11

It's not a matter of muzzling someone who's taking on a

12

case.

13

category of cases where we pay for representation.

14

is another category of cases where we don't pay for

15

representation.

16

It's a matter of the Government saying, this is the
This

We're not muzzling anybody.

MR. NEUBORNE:

Yes, sir.

We have no quarrel

17

with the general principle that the Government has broad

18

power to determine the kinds and categories of cases that

19

it wishes to fund.

20

QUESTION:

What's wrong with a category of case

21

that involves welfare recipients, but does not involve a

22

challenge to the constitutionality of the welfare law, or

23

the validity of regulations enacted under the welfare law?

24

What is wrong with that as a category?

25

MR. NEUBORNE:

What's wrong with it, Justice
24

1

Scalia, is that it is overtly too broadbased.

2

Government simply merges its idea of category into the

3

notion of whether or not the Government -- a lawyer for

4

the poor is to be permitted to raise an argument that

5

challenges the Government's own viewpoint about what the

6

law should be, the Government has simply taken and

7

broadened a power of categorization but used it to permit

8

the argument of one side of this question and not the

9

argument of another.

has said that you can represent someone in court, in a

particular subject matter area, but you cannot challenge

21

22

This is the only restriction that I've

QUESTION:

But it hasn't said that.

It has

23

said, you can represent someone in court so long as it is

24

a case that does not involve a challenge to this event.

25

MR. NEUBORNE:

Yes, but that's simply -25

1

QUESTION:

There's a big difference.

2

MR. NEUBORNE:

Well, with respect, I don't think

3

so, because all it does is impose an unconstitutional

4

provision on the subsidy.

5

to the client is that it will give you this money.

6

will give you this money on condition that there is to be

7

no argument raised in this case that challenges the legal

8

status quo.

9

QUESTION:

What it says to the lawyer and
It

What if the statute said, Mr.

10

Neuborne, that these Legal Service lawyers could represent

11

low income clients seeking welfare benefits, but they --

once a case went to court, they could not handle it?

13

MR. NEUBORNE:

That --

24

QUESTION:

What would be your answer to that?

25

MR. NEUBORNE:

There is -- it would depend on
26

1

the motive with which the restriction was imposed.

2

motive had been imposed in order to weaken the enforcement

3

to dissipate in legal rights, then it would be

4

viewpoint-discriminatory then.

5

QUESTION:

If the

If the motive --

Well, why wasn't Rust a situation

6

involving some kind of viewpoint discrimination under your

7

view?

I mean, we have to deal with Rust.

8

MR. NEUBORNE:

Under the Court's decision in

9

Rust, a fundamental distinction was raised, and if I could

10

compare two cases that the Chief Justice wrote, I think it

11

would demonstrate that.

12

In TR -- in TWR, this Court held that there is

13

substantial power to differentiate among speakers in

14

granting subsidies as long as viewpoint-neutral criteria

15

are used.

16

Court then said, where the Government is in fact not -- is

17

in fact a participant in this speech forum -- in other

18

words, where the Government wishes to expound its own

19

message --

20

In Rust, the Court went one step further.

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Neuborne, Rust doesn't say

21

where the Government wishes to expound its own -- Rust

22

didn't say that the Government is the speaker.

23

The

MR. NEUBORNE:

Well, my understanding, Chief

24

Justice, is that is the way the Court has construed

25

subsequent cases.
27

1

QUESTION:

Well, are you talking about the Rust

2

opinion -- you say you're going to compare two cases which

3

I wrote, one of them being TWR --

4

MR. NEUBORNE:

5

QUESTION:

6

I'm sorry.

-- and one being Rust.

Did you get

out of the Rust opinion?

7

MR. NEUBORNE:

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. NEUBORNE:

That'll teach me to do that.

The -- as I read the Rust case,

10

and this is before Rosenberger put the gloss on it that

11

I've attempted to present this morning, but as I

12

originally read the Rust opinion, and as I believe it's

13

fairly read, Rust was a case in which the Government had a

14

substantive program with a particular point of view that

15

it wished to have disseminated and was hiring doctors to

16

disseminate that point of view and not the other point of

17

view, and as long as the Government --

18

QUESTION:

Well, maybe here the Government has a

19

welfare program and they believe in it, and they don't

20

want it challenged.

21

MR. NEUBORNE:

Well, but that point of view --

22

yes, the only difference here is that the Government does

23

have a Rust speaker in this case.

24

speaker in this case is the Government's lawyer.

25

the Government program that the Government speaks through,

The Government's Rust

6

QUESTION:

What the Government is attempting to

It's not the Government's lawyer,

it's the client's lawyer.
MR. NEUBORNE:

the other lawyer in the case --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. NEUBORNE:

9

No, what I meant, the Government,

Oh.

Oh.
-- is the speaker that would fall

within the Rust parameters.

That is a situation where the

10

Government has hired somebody to speak for the Government,

11

to advance a Government message.

12

What the Government is attempting to do here is

13

to commandeer the voice of the other lawyer in the case as

14

well, and this Court has already unequivocally held that a

15

subsidized lawyer for the poor does not act under color of

16

law precisely because the subsidized lawyer doesn't speak

17

for the State, may not be permitted to even think about

18

speaking for the State, because the lawyer's duty is to

19

the client, and to insulate the lawyer from the

20

possibility of being controlled by the State, in the --

21

this Court has held unequivocally that the lawyer doesn't

22

act under color of law.

23

QUESTION:

Now, if --

Mr. Neuborne, I want to get you to

24

state your first premise, and I think it's this, but if

25

I'm wrong, that's what I want to find out.
29

1

You've got one principle.

To state it crudely,

2

the Government can decide what to pay for and what not to

3

pay for.

4

MR. NEUBORNE:

5

QUESTION:

Yes.

You've got another principle that

6

says, the Government cannot use its leverage, whether it

7

be by subsidization or otherwise, to engage in viewpoint

8

discrimination.

9

MR. NEUBORNE:

10

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Is your basic principle that whenever

11

a given set of facts could be characterized by either one

12

or the other of those principles, that the First Amendment

13

principle always prevails, that trumps the other one, that

14

there always should be a choice to characterize the issue

15

as a speech issue, not as a mere subsidization issue?

16

MR. NEUBORNE:

I'm not sure I understand what --

17

your question, but I'll try to answer it.

18

this --

19
20

QUESTION:

My principle is

He's asking you if Rust has to be

overruled to decide this case.

21

(Laughter.)

22

MR. NEUBORNE:

23

QUESTION:

24

(Laughter.)

25

MR. NEUBORNE:

Thank you, Justice Stevens.

Why don't you answer my question?

I used to have a fantasy saying I
30

1

was going to put one of you on hold while I answered this

2

question.

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. NEUBORNE:

The question -- may I answer them

5

in order?

6

the activity itself that the Government is funding is so

7

permeated with First Amendment overtones, as this Court

8

has noted.

9

Justice Souter's question I think applies where

I mean, speech in court on behalf of a poor

10

client can be a petition to redress grievances.

It is a

11

forum of ideas.

12

it's a specialized forum in which the clash of ideas is

13

crucially important, and in which the Government may never

14

be permitted to put its thumb on the scales of those ideas

15

in an effort to use law to control viewpoint, and the

16

viewpoint here is the viewpoint of legality.

Of course it's not a public forum, but

17

As Justice Kennedy pointed out in the

18

Rosenberger opinion, when you exclude an entire

19

perspective from the forum you have skewed that forum

20

forever.

21

QUESTION:

But Rosenberger was a definite

22

creation by the Government of a forum, and I really

23

question your analogizing the -- what many people call a

24

forum in court, as the same thing as the Government

25

creating a forum.

It really isn't at all.
31

1

MR. NEUBORNE:

It's not necessarily the same

2

thing.

3

creation of a limited public forum for widespread speech.

4

The forum in Rosenberger, of course, was the

The forum that we have here is the creation of a

5

funding scheme designed to enhance and permit speech

6

within a court.

7

public forum.

8

Now, that's not the same thing as a
Nobody can walk in off the street --

QUESTION:

So you would concede that it's lawful

9

to prevent the attorney, using Government funds, from

10

engaging in lobbying activities, or writing a Senator

11

saying please change this law to make it more clear?

12

MR. NEUBORNE:

Well, unless one could identify a

13

forum in which that would take place.

14

that that's unconstitutional -- that that's necessarily

15

constitutional, because if it was done with the intention

16

of making it difficult to provide a particular point of

17

view to the Government, it would raise problems.

18

the purposes of the argument this morning, we do have the

19

most discrete forum that you can think of.

20

forum --

21

QUESTION:

I don't concede

But for

It is a

My next question was going to be, we

22

then have to identify something that looks like a forum

23

and that we can call a limited forum.

24
25

MR. NEUBORNE:

Well, or, as you wrote in

Arkansas Public Television, a private forum, because in
32

1

Arkansas Public Television, which I believe is the most

2

relevant precedent, in Arkansas Public Television, the

3

Court was confronted with a forum that itself had

4

constitutional protection, where the participants in that

5

forum, the public journalists, were themselves entitled to

6

a degree of First Amendment protection.

7

And I think what this Court, as I read Arkansas

8

Public Television, what this Court held is that when the

9

journalists are essentially exercising their own editorial

10

discretion, when they're speaking for themselves, then

11

they're essentially Rust participants, and they're

12

entitled to say what they would, to engage in all sorts of

13

viewpoint determination, and no one has the right, simply

14

because public funds are being used, to claim that there

15

is a command that other types of speech have been

16

determined.

17

QUESTION:

I confess to being really confused by

18

this forum discussion.

19

forum here.

20

courtrooms that are deciding particular cases.

21

not one single forum; there are

22

particular cases.

23

said, you can go into this forum and you can't go into the

24

other forum.

25

I don't see the creation of any

MR. NEUBORNE:

Yes, but it -33

1

QUESTION:

It's not a matter of discriminating

2

between speakers in some single forum that the Government

3

has invented.

4

MR. NEUBORNE:

With respect, Justice Scalia, I

5

don't think the Government has said -- is saying you can

6

go into this forum and not that forum based on an effort

7

to insulate its complaint from challenge.

8
9
10

It is the fact that these are
viewpoint-discriminatory criteria that the Government is
using to condition access to the forum.

11

QUESTION:

Perhaps so, but not conditionally

12

access to a single forum.

13

some forums, and you can't go into some other forums.

14

MR. NEUBORNE:

They're saying you can go into

Well, you can go into a courtroom

15

as long as you argue in favor of the Government's status

16

quo.

You cannot enter the courtroom --

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. NEUBORNE:

19
20

That's not so.
-- if you argue against the

Government's status quo.
QUESTION:

That's not so.

I don't

No, but --

We're not going to fund if certain

issues are involved in the case.
34

Now, there are other

1

forums where those issues aren't involved, and you can go

2

into theirs.

3

Now, maybe there's something against that, but

4

it seems to me it doesn't analogize to creating a single

5

forum and then discriminating among speakers in some

single forum.

QUESTION:

We do have in some States, the State

24

of California I know, the rule that an administrative

25

agency cannot question the constitutionality of a statute.
35

1

MR. NEUBORNE:

Yes, but of course that's, one,

2

in an administrative proceeding, it is not in a judicial

3

proceeding, and there's no effort to condition a subsidy

4

on a willingness to either agree or not agree with the

5

Government's status quo.

6

QUESTION:

Well, I'm saying it's not unheard of

7

to have forums for the adjudication of legal issues where

8

that forum itself is limited.

MR. NEUBORNE:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. NEUBORNE:

12

QUESTION:

It's of course --

Oh, yes.

-- not a Federal court.
Yes.

Well, there's also a doctrine from

13

this Court that municipal corporations created by the

14

State can't challenge State regulations.

15

MR. NEUBORNE:

Yes, and those are substantive

16

rules of law governing power here, but here what the

17

Government has done is taken a subsidy, a speech subsidy,

18

a crucially important --

19

QUESTION:

Suppose that I was worried about the

20

public forum doctrine, not knowing what happens if you

21

start applying it in the way you want, but suppose I

22

accepted your argument -- this is all hypothetical.

23

MR. NEUBORNE:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. NEUBORNE:

Yes, I mean, could I just --

Suppose I accepted your argument --- it's a private forum.

QUESTION:

Well, whatever kind of a forum.

2

There's a whole speech mechanism there that you're

3

suddenly transposing here, and suppose I nonetheless

4

agreed with you, for hypothetical sake, that this is a

5

very unreasonable thing in respect to a client who may be

6

entitled to money, i.e., property owed by the Government.

May I suggest one other strand that,

I wondered why you didn't pick it up?

as a classic unconstitutional condition case.

23

here we give you a pot of money, like we give you whatever

24

the benefit was in Speiser, but if with your own money

25

you're going to do what we don't want to have heard, then
37

One could view this
That is,

1

not only are we not going to fund that, but we're going to

pull the money, and -- but you didn't explicitly argue

3

that, and I wondered why.

4

MR. NEUBORNE:

5

Justice Breyer along those terms.

6

entirely apart from viewpoint discrimination, there's a

7

very powerful, really two-pronged unconstitutional

8

conditions argument.

9

Well, I was going to answer
There is a powerful --

The first prong of the unconstitutional

10

conditions argument says that what's happening here is,

11

the Government's conditioning the formation of an

attorney-client relationship, not only that, the formation

13

of an attorney-client relationship of great intensity,

14

because it looks forward to actual litigation in court.

15

It is welfare litigation that's being funded here.

16

So that the Government is funding this intense

17

associational relationship, but it is imposing a condition

18

in which you waive the ability to make certain arguments

19

under it.

20
21

QUESTION:

And what constitutional provision

does that violate?

MR. NEUBORNE:

anyway.

In other words, you can only have --

about dealing with forum analysis.

The other argument that --

Before you get off of

6

unconstitutional conditions, it seems to me you can

7

convert Rust and, indeed, every Government-funding case

8

into an unconstitutional condition case if you're of such

9

a mind.

10

MR. NEUBORNE:

Well, I --

16

bit.

17

MR. NEUBORNE:

You can't produce, you know,
Every funding you could

Well, that's a fair critique, but

18

what's different here from, say, an art funding case, or

19

something like that, is here you're funding an intense

20

associational relationship that this Court has already

21

held is entitled to protection against Government

22

manipulation.

23

itself that said, if this were a traditional

24

doctor-patient relationship, if this were a traditional

25

relationship between a university teacher and a student,

It's the language, it's the dictum in Rust

39

1

and I believe certainly a traditional relationship between

2

a lawyer and a client, that the First Amendment guarantees

3

a degree of autonomy to that relationship.

4

cannot, simply because it's paying for the relationship --

QUESTION:

6

MR. NEUBORNE:

7

Well now, Rust did not say that.

said it might be a different case.
MR. NEUBORNE:

Yes.

It didn't say that the opposite rule

would prevail.

The Government

MR. NEUBORNE:
Honor.

Yes, that's absolutely true, Your

I'm not suggesting that Rust --

15

QUESTION:

I thought you were.

16

MR. NEUBORNE: -- demands this.

I was simply

17

saying that in Rust you alluded to it in your opinion and

18

said it might be a different case, and I'm suggesting this

19

is that different case.

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Neuborne, I don't quite

21

understand your answer to Justice Scalia, because I would

22

have thought you would have said about the art is, sure,

23

the Government doesn't have to buy a painting that it

24

doesn't like.

25

It doesn't have to buy an indecent painting, but
40

1

it can say to this artist that's painting on Government

2

funds, it's a lovely portrait, but with your -- in your

3

own -- for your own collection, or for your other gallery

4

owner, you can't do indecent art, and that's --

5

MR NEUBORNE:

No, I was certainly not -- I

6

certainly didn't intend to suggest that you could

7

condition restrictions on the use of private money based

8

on an art subsidy, and that's the other unconstitutional

9

condition here.

10

QUESTION:

Yes.

11

MR. NEUBORNE:

The other unconstitutional

12

condition here is, it takes the very substantial -- and I

13

must disagree with the Solicitor General.

14

substantial private resources.

15

It takes very

There are State resources, but there are also

16

very substantial private resources donated to Legal

17

Services offices to enable them to provide certain service

18

to the poor.

19

says, you can't use that money to advance these arguments

20

unless you set up an enormously expensive, enormously

21

burdensome separate facility from which to carry out the

22

entity, so that it essentially places a huge burden on the

23

use of private money, and it's a burden different from

24

Rust, because the burden in Rust that was justified

25

because it was the Government speaking, and because it was

It takes that money, and it essentially

41

1

the Government speaking -- I'm sorry, sir.

2
3

QUESTION:

Rust did not say it was the

Government speaking.

4

MR. NEUBORNE:

No, sir, but I'm trying to

5

distinguish Rust.

6

Court has indicated on a number of occasions, there were

7

at least three cases in which Rust has been explained as a

8

Government speech case, not necessarily the Government

9

itself.

10

QUESTION:

In Rust, as Justice Kennedy and as the

No.

What Rosenberger said, which

11

perhaps you're referring to, is that the Government used

12

private speakers to transmit specific information

13

pertaining to its own program.

14

MR. NEUBORNE:

15

QUESTION:

16

That's what --

It didn't say that the Government was

the speaker.

17

MR. NEUBORNE:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. NEUBORNE:

I stand corrected.

Even Rosenberger didn't say that.
That's what I meant.

When the

20

Government has a substantive message that it wishes

21

conveyed, and it either uses its own employees or private

22

people to do so, the Government then is essentially acting

23

as a participant in the speech process and can engage in

24

viewpoint discrimination.

25

That is clearly not the case here.
42

Here, no one

1

could argue that a lawyer for the poor is somehow

2

disseminating a Government-approved set of information

3

pursuant to some substantive approach.

4

QUESTION:

Unless you say the Government here,

5

acting through Congress, wants everybody to say the

6

welfare laws are fine as written.

7

MR. NEUBORNE:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. NEUBORNE:

Well, and that's exactly what --

That's the message.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. NEUBORNE:

Yes.

That's exactly what --

And that's kind of close to Rust.
Well, but it's also kind of close

12

to Barnetti.

13

cannot -- West Virginia v. Barnett.

14

If -- to Barnett -- that the Government

The Government simply can't compel everyone to

15

say that the welfare laws are fine as written, and they

16

can't use the sub -- a subsidy to breach that.

Well, Barnett was where you

18

required someone to affirmatively say something they

19

didn't believe.

20

degree here.

21

I don't see any requirement of that

MR. NEUBORNE:

Well, if you're a Legal Services

22

lawyer, you either stay out of the case if there's an

23

important constitutional question, or, if you're going to

24

take the case, you have to take the case on condition that

25

you don't raise certain arguments about the validity of
43

1

the Government's program.

2

QUESTION:

That essentially silences --

Oh, I don't think that's an option. I

3

think given professional responsibilities, the only option

4

is the first.

5

MR. NEUBORNE:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. NEUBORNE:

Well --

They cannot take the case.
The option of not taking the case

8

is very difficult, first because Legal Services clients,

or welfare clients don't appear on your doorstep, Justice

10

Scalia, color-coded by argument.

with someone that appears, you have to -- you speak to

them, you have to interview them, you have to investigate

the case.

When you enter the

Well, but it --

-- has any bearing upon its

unconstitutionality.

20

MR. NEUBORNE:

21

QUESTION:

If it --

It may be a lot of trouble to sort

22

out those cases that the Government wants to subsidize and

23

those cases that it doesn't want to --

24

MR. NEUBORNE:

25

QUESTION:

Well --

-- maybe it's too much trouble.
44

1

MR. NEUBORNE:

Can I suggest a very bright line,

2

and it may be too bright a line, but the line is this, and

3

I think it's the line that emerges from the Court's cases.

4

When it is a private speaker, speaking on behalf

5

of a private person, and the speech is directed to a

6

forum, in this case a courtroom, which is important for

7

the clash of ideas, the Government may not use viewpoint

8

as a criteria for determining how the funds are going to

9

be used.

10

QUESTION:

Suppose I told you that I begin with

11

the premise that the restriction on lawyers lobbying for

12

legislative changes or writing legislators, et cetera, is

13

valid.

14

premise you just suggested to the Court?

15

How could I reach that conclusion and adopt the

MR. NEUBORNE:

Well, I -- under those

16

circumstances -- you mean the lawyer lobbying on behalf of

17

a client --

18
19

QUESTION:

I want you to assume that that's a

valid statute and a valid restriction.

20

MR. NEUBORNE:

Yes, and the lawyer can't lobby

21

on behalf of a client as well as on his own -- on behalf

22

of his own beliefs.

23

QUESTION:

Could I reach that conclusion and

24

still adopt the premise that you just suggested to the

25

Court?
45

1
2
3
4
5

MR. NEUBORNE:

Yes, I believe you could.

I

believe you could first because of the -QUESTION:

Then why isn't the Congress a forum,

et cetera, or a legitimate place to petition, et cetera?
MR. NEUBORNE:

Well, it is, and I believe that

6

that would be an unconstitutional statute.

7

that that statute does not require you to lobby on one

8

side of the issue and not lobby on the other.

9

But I believe

In other words, if the restriction were written,

10

you can't lobby to change the status quo, but you can

11

lobby to somehow cement the status quo, that would be a

12

viewpoint-based discrimination.

13

QUESTION:

But --

14

MR. NEUBORNE:

If it is simply a categorical ban

15

on all types of conduct, regardless of whether it is

16

viewpoint-based or not, that's a very different story.

17

QUESTION:

But your status quo argument is a

18

very fast, you know, moving target too.

19

say that an attorney who goes into court and urges that

20

his client receive a welfare benefit is -- argues to

21

change the status quo.

22

Government now has the money.

In fairness, though, it's the

It's the legal --

QUESTION:

Well, yeah, but, sir, that is just a

question of how you define the thing.

5

MR. NEUBORNE:

Well, but that's what the statute

6

says.

7

heard today the Legal Services Corporation concede the

8

enormous reach of it.

9

challenge whether or not a particular regulation or

10

statute is or is not a valid regulation or statute.

11

must take it as written, and apply it as written.

12

The statute says you can't go into court, and you

You cannot go into a court and

You

That, I suggest to you, is a core

13

viewpoint-based discrimination, and a core interference

14

with what attorneys ordinarily do for clients, and so it

15

is an interference with the autonomous relationship,

16

because it tells the lawyer what arguments the lawyer is

17

allowed to make and what arguments he's not.

18

Now, if

QUESTION:

20

MR. NEUBORNE:

QUESTION:

Mr. Neuborne --- it is not the viewpoint --

-- suppose during World War II -- I

22

don't know if the Government did this, but suppose it

23

decided to subsidize patriotic films.

24

Hollywood producers money to produce films that would buoy

25

up the spirit of the American people during the war.
47

It wanted to give

We

don't want Ginger Rogers, we want Humphrey Bogart and

2

Casablanca and all the anti-Nazi --

3

MR. NEUBORNE:

Well, Ginger Rogers could be

patriotic.

5

QUESTION:

Okay.

6

MR. NEUBORNE:

7

QUESTION:

Is that okay?

It might be, sir, yes.

But you can't do Ginger Rogers and

8

Fred Astaire, just Bogart, or you know, other

9

patriotic-type films.

10

MR. NEUBORNE:

Well, that's very close to the

11

hypothetical that you used on a number of occasions about

12

the National Endowment for Democracy.

13

it is not our argument that just because you fund the

14

National Endowment on Democracy you have to fund the

15

National Endowment on Totalitarianism.

We don't claim --

Government -- it's like Rust.

2

are a series of ideas we want to get out there.

3

7

The Government says there
Those are

If that's what's happening, then its

If, on the other hand, what they're doing is

8

subsidizing large numbers of private individuals to speak

9

without creating a Government program -- and the big

10

difference here is Pope v. Johnson.

11

you can't think of a subsidized lawyer as someone who is

12

simply parroting the Government's line.

13

QUESTION:

Pope v. Johnson says

Yeah, but why can't the Government

14

say the things we're interested in subsidizing here is,

15

where someone has been denied benefits to which he's

16

entitled under the text, we're not going to get into, you

17

know, whether the regulations are okay, or the statutes

18

are okay.

19

subsidize.

It's just this one thing we want to

20

MR. NEWBORN:

21

QUESTION:

No, because in order to --

Just like we want to subsidize

22

patriotism, we don't want to subsidize Ginger Rogers, we

23

want to subsidize, you know, making -- defending claims

24

under the text of a statute.

25

beyond that.

We just don't want to go

49

1

MR. NEWBORN:

Because they're speaking through a

2

person who cannot possibly be thought of as expressing the

3

Government's view, and if what it wishes to do is speak

4

through someone who does not express the Government view,

5

it cannot use viewpoint-based criteria for allocating

6

the subsidies.

7

QUESTION:

Well, I don't think Humphrey Bogart

8

would want to be thought of as being a mouthpiece for the

9

Government's view --

10

MR. NEWBORN:

11

QUESTION:

12

Well, he would be.

-- or the producer of the case for

that matter --

MR. NEWBORN:

MR. NEWBORN:

He would be.

-- of the movie.
He would be, if he was funded

16

pursuant to a Government program that was designed to

17

foster patriotism during war as part of the Government's

18

propaganda apparatus.

19
20

Now, he may not like being called that, but
that's what he is.

21

QUESTION:

Well --

22

MR. NEWBORN:

And -- but that's very different

23

from saying they're going to fund a bunch of university

24

professors to conduct some research and then say to the

25

university professors, the only kind of things that you
50

1

could say are things that support the status quo, not

2

things that don't support the status quo, because the

3

university professors cannot be perceived as speaking for

4

the Government under those circumstances, any more than

5

the lawyer here can be seen as speaking for the

6

Government.

Well, it can --

QUESTION:

I didn't notice your light was on.

I'm not going to ask you.

14

MR. NEWBORN:

Thank you.

15

The test that this Court has set out is not a

16

perfect test.

It's hard to decide whether or not someone

17

speaks for the Government or does not speak for the

18

Government.

19

Court treated the doctors as though they were speaking for

the Government, which means that the principle with

The

1

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

2

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER UNITED STATES

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

4

It's important to bear in mind that what we have

5

here is what type -- is a question concerning what type of

6

professional services is the Government going to pay for

7

under a Government program which is neither a regulation

8

nor is it a funding restriction that affects private

9

expression of the sort that was involved in NEA.

10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

It is

funding professional services.

11

I also take substantial issue with respondent's

12

claim that all that Rust covers is Government speech.

13

the Chief Justice pointed out, Rust itself did not say

14

that, and this Court's subsequent cases have not said

15

that.

16

As

In the Rosenberger case, for example, in

17

addition to the passage the Chief Justice quoted about

18

using private persons to deliver a message pertaining to

19

the Government's own program, on page 630 -- or 834, the

20

Court further said, it does not follow from the Government

21

speaking -- where the Government itself speaks, that it

22

does not follow that viewpoint-based restrictions are

23

proper when the university does not itself speak, or

24

subsidized transmittal of a message that it favors, but

25

instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views
52

1
2

from private speakers.
The dichotomy that was created in Rosenberger

3

was one where the Government is subsidizing essentially a

4

forum where the Government gives money to a forum and asks

5

the private speakers to have at it with one another for

6

the benefit of the public at large, which is different

7

from subsidizing a message the Government favors.

8
9

Here, although the Legal Services lawyer
opposing a State agency may not be advancing the

10

Government's speech, the Government has decided that when

11

it comes to a challenge of a State welfare regulation,

12

that is not a message that the Government favors within

13

the meaning of Rust.

14

And again, NEA and the Wisconsin case last term

15

did not suggest that Rust was limited to situations where

16

it is the Government's own speech.

17

One way in which this case raises even less of a

18

First Amendment question than Rust is the fact that in

19

Rust the doctor was not even permitted to advise the

20

client where other services could be obtained.

21

program, the Legal Services lawyer, if he or she

22

identifies a possible challenge to a statute or

23

regulation, may tell the client that, may refer the client

24

to another agency, to a pro bono list.

25

Under this

Every LSC recipient is required to have a
53

attorneys to whom cases may be referred, so there is no

Even though there's no

Lawyers do this all the time.

Legal

With respect to issues concerning challenging

16

the Government's position, one need look no further than

17

sovereign immunity on the State level to the Eleventh

18

Amendment to recognize that there are many situations in

19

which the Government may decline to allow challenges in

20

court to its own positions and, by the same token,

21

Congress could certainly choose not to -- could repeal the

22

Equal Access to Justice Act and not provide attorney's

23

fees to people who want to sue the Government, even though

24

it may provide attorney's fees for suits against private

25

parties.
54

1

And as we point out in our brief, Congress has

2

provided differential standards for the award of

3

attorney's fees, favoring plaintiffs in certain types of

4

cases like environmental cases or civil rights cases, but

5

not favoring the defendants in those cases.

6

As Justice Scalia pointed out, all litigation

7

has two sides, and in one respect could be viewed as

8

viewpoint, but this Court has never analyzed regulations

9

on attorney conduct or the attorney-client relationship in

10

that way.

11

Also, with respect to the argument that this is

12

an anti-Government -- a prohibition against

13

anti-Government speech, this is -- there's not a

14

monolithic Government here.

15

recipient from taking on a case where what she would be

16

doing would be challenging a State regulation as being in

17

violation of Federal law.

18

This statute prohibits an LSC

In other words, it would be a situation where

19

the lawyer might even be trying to vindicate, in her view,

20

what Federal law says on the subject, but still the client

21

is not, or the attorney is not permitted to take that on.

22

Congress could reasonably determine in the allocation of

23

scarce resources that that was a better allocation of the

24

resources.
