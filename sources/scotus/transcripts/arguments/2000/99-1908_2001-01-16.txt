CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

4

first this morning in Number 99-1908, James Alexander v.

5

Martha Sandoval.

6

Mr. Sutton.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. SUTTON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. SUTTON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may

it please the Court:

11

There are two points that I would like to make

12

this morning.

The first is that it is never appropriate

13

for a branch of the Federal Government to imply the

14

creation of a private right of action under the spending

15

power.

16

participation of the State as a defendant in this case,

17

the Court's implied right-of-action doctrine does not

18

extend to these disparate effect regulations.

The second is that, regardless of the

19

Let me start with the first point.

In case

20

after case over the last two to three decades the Court

21

has made clear that States are not run-of-the-mill civil

22

defendants.

23

coequal sovereigns and, as a result, the Court has not

24

lightly inferred that Congress means to regulate the

25

States as States, to regulate in core areas of local

They are not mere interest groups.

3

They are

1

sovereignty, or, as here, to expose the States to a

2

private right of action.

3

particularly critical when it comes to the spending --

Those principles are

4

QUESTION:

5

damages action here, are we?

6
7

MR. SUTTON:

That's true, Your Honor.

That's

exactly --

8
9

Well, we're not dealing with a

QUESTION:

We're dealing with prospective

relief.

10

MR. SUTTON:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. SUTTON:

That's true, Your Honor.
Declaratory and prospective.
Exactly, Your Honor and, of course,

13

the Eleventh Amendment applies even to injunctive relief

14

and even, as this particular case reveals, you can still

15

alter the Federal-State balance by allowing private rights

16

of action.

17

case not unlike this one on just this ground.

18

Indeed, in Cannon, the Court distinguished a

In Cannon, in footnote 13, the Court reviewed

19

many of the implied right-of-action cases it had decided,

20

and it looked at a case called Santa Clara Pueblo, a case

21

in which the Court had not implied a right of action

22

against a tribe, and for that -- and the reason it did not

23

imply a right of action was because tribes are sovereigns.

24

Now, they're statutory sovereigns, whereas States are

25

constitutional sovereigns.
4

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Sutton, do I understand what you

2

just told us to mean that if the Cannon case had been

3

against the State medical school instead of against a

4

private university there would have been no claim?

5

MR. SUTTON:

I think that's right, Your Honor.

6

I think that's right, and it would have been -- of course,

7

it's an even harder claim here, because this claim is

8

under regulations, which is something the Court has never

9

inferred before from congressional actions.

10

QUESTION:

That's a different point, but I

11

wanted to know how sweeping your position is, and you are

12

saying that if Cannon had been against the University of

13

Illinois instead of the Medical School of the University

14

of Chicago, it would have been thrown out?

15

MR. SUTTON:

That's exactly what I'm saying,

16

Your Honor, and I think that's true, and that is our first

17

principal point.

18

all of the cases -- I mean, whether you look at Gregory v.

19

Ashcroft, Atascadero, or South Dakota v. Dole, Pennhurst,

20

all of those cases made clear, when you alter the Federal-

21

State balance Congress has to be unmistakable in what it's

22

doing, and in this case it was anything but unmistakable.

23

Everyone agrees --

24
25

And I think, Your Honor, it follows from

QUESTION:

Cannon itself said that's -- as far

as implied rights of action it said, we come from a past
5

1

when Congress was reacting to the courts' activity and

2

knew that the courts were implying private rights of

3

action.

4

Congress, we're now putting you on notice that henceforth

5

we are not going to imply private rights of action, but we

6

understand that Cannon comes from a different milieu, and

7

we're going to -- not going to change that.

I thought Cannon said, this much but no further.

8
9

MR. SUTTON:
different.

But, Your Honor, States are

The Court -- the only case that's been

10

identified so far by respondents involving what seems to

11

be an oxymoron, implied right of action against the State,

12

is the Allen case from 1969.

13

Clause case, point number 1, but point number 2, more

14

importantly, that's a case that falls under this case's --

15

this Court's decisions, specifically Atascadero, where you

16

can have an overwhelming implication in the statute that a

17

right of action was created.

That was not a Spending

18

In Allen, had there not been a right of action,

19

the individuals would not have been able to enforce other

20

parts of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.

21

not a classic implied right-of-action case where there's

22

no suggestion in the statute that Congress meant to create

23

a right of action.

24
25

That case is

In this case, it's just the opposite.

Here,

Congress did create a right of action, just not by private
6

1

individuals, by agencies, so you said my first proposition

2

is a sweeping one, and perhaps it is, but there are not a

3

lot of cases recognizing the implied right-of-action

4

doctrine against States.

5

Court has been doing.

6

QUESTION:

I mean, that's not something the

That's true, but you do -- in your

7

view, is this -- do I have your argument correct that

8

there'll be a certain number of civil rights statutes

9

where, in respect to an implied right of action, there is

10

basically silence, and do you think there could be a

11

number of those statutes where you would imply from that

12

silence a private right of action against an individual

13

but not against a State?

14
15

MR. SUTTON:

That may be true, Your Honor, but I

did --

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. SUTTON:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

That's your view?

It is your view?
It is my view, Your Honor.
All right.

If that's your view, then

you're reading a lot of complication into the silence.
MR. SUTTON:

The reason you're saying that is

21

because States will be treated differently from other

22

litigants in the statutes?

23

QUESTION:

Yes.

You're reading all that into a

24

silence, so if you're going to read that much complication

25

into the silence, why not read into it that you could
7

1

bring injunctive actions but not damage actions, given the

2

Eleventh Amendment?

3

MR. SUTTON:

Well, Your Honor, first of all, as

4

Justice Powell said in Atascadero, States are different.

5

I mean, to quote him at page 246, given their

6

constitutional role, the States are not like any other

7

class of recipients of Federal aid.

8

premise for the Court's clear statement decisions.

9

QUESTION:

That's exactly the

Is there any authority for that kind

10

of interpretation of a silence that we get out of the

11

silence actions against a private person but not actions

12

against the State?

13

MR. SUTTON:

That's exactly Atascadero, where

14

you could get money damages actions against private

15

individuals under Section 504, but not against States, so

16

there is authority for that exact point.

17

But I do want to go back to, I think a premise

18

in your question, which is that this argument is somehow

19

sweeping because there are lots of other civil rights

20

statutes where somehow there would not now be a right of

21

action against the State, and we're concerned about that.

22

I don't think that's true, however.

23

those statutes are.

24
25

I don't know what

No one's pointed them out.

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 itself, Congress
was very explicit when it wanted either private rights of
8

1

action, as in Title II or Title VII, or AG enforcement

2

actions, as in Title III and Title IV.

3

QUESTION:

Title VI --

Atascadero, which you put so much

4

reliance on, is distinguishable in that it did involve a

5

money damage action, and it explicitly involved the

6

Eleventh Amendment.

7

MR. SUTTON:

That's not the issue here, is it?
That's true, Your Honor, but as I

8

pointed out, in Cannon, in footnote 14, the Court has

9

already dealt with this very issue.

Santa Clara Pueblo

10

was a case that was an ex parte Young action against a

11

tribe.

12

an express right of action for habeas corpus relief.

It

13

said nothing else under the Indian Civil Rights Act.

That

14

was the statute at issue.

What the statute in that case said is, we create

15

The Court said, in light of the silence, in

16

light of the express creation of one cause of action,

17

silence about any other one, and in light of the

18

sovereignty of the -- the statutory sovereignty of tribes,

19

we're not going to imply a right of action.

20

itself, and that is this case.

21

of action casually against statutory sovereigns, you

22

surely don't do it against constitutional sovereigns.

23

QUESTION:

That's Cannon

If you don't imply rights

Would you explain, Mr. Sutton, the

24

impact in the civil rights remedies, Equalization Act that

25

I thought waived the Eleventh Amendment immunity for Title
9

1

VI, Title IX -- and 504 cases, no?

2

MR. SUTTON:

You're referring to the 1986

3

Rehabilitation Act amendments?

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. SUTTON:

Right.
Your Honor, that's a very good

6

point, and we're very sympathetic to it, but I just want

7

to clarify one thing.

8

of the standard I'm advocating.

9

standard, because what happens in 1986 is, Congress shows

That point goes to the application
It does not contest the

10

it understands this dialogue between the Court and

11

Congress as to what is required before you regulate the

12

States in these areas, and I think there's a very good

13

argument that Congress was express in 1986 that there were

14

causes of action against States, but conspicuously missing

15

from those amendments is any indication that they were

16

causes of action under regulations, as opposed to the

17

statutory antidiscrimination --

18

QUESTION:

I thought you were stating sweepingly

19

that when you answered my question, Cannon was under the

20

basic prohibition, not against --

21

MR. SUTTON:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. SUTTON:

24

QUESTION:

25

Title IX.
Right.
Under 901, yes.
Right, and you said there would be no

such claim, but now I think you're amending that, because
10

1

you said after the '86 act there would be.

2

MR. SUTTON:

Well then, I misunderstood your

3

question.

4

cases.

5

silent about creating a private right of action, and I'm

6

acknowledging the argument is sweeping in that respect.

7

It applies to all statutes.

8
9

I thought you were referring to all other

I mean, in other words, all statutes that are

You are right, after 1986, when it comes to
Section 504, Title IX and Title VI, the argument's not

10

sweeping at all when it comes to the antidiscrimination

11

mandate, because, as respondents have argued, in 1986

12

Congress picked up on the dialogue and said, we are going

13

to create an express right of action, so when it comes to

14

intentional discrimination, that which is barred by Title

15

VI or Title IX, there is a right of action.

16

But the critical failing with that particular

17

argument, and I think that's why it's really not being

18

relied upon by respondents, is Congress says nothing at

19

all about rights of action under regulations, which you

20

know, after all, is an extraordinary concept.

21
22

QUESTION:

What if it were a city who was the --

which was the defendant in the case?

23

MR. SUTTON:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. SUTTON:

In this particular case?
Uh-huh.
Well, I think, as this Court has
11

1

said, cities are different from States.

2

view, cities are -- they're statutory sovereigns.

3

State --

4

QUESTION:

I mean, in my
They're

Do you acknowledge there would be a

5

private right of action for enforcement of the regulations

6

against a city?

7

MR. SUTTON:

There would be with respect to the

8

first argument I'm making, but let me switch now to the

9

second argument we're making, where I do not think there

10

would be a right of action against a city, county, or for

11

that matter, a private person.

12

When one looks at all of the Court's implied

13

right-of-action cases whether it's 1964 in the Borak

14

decision, or Cannon, or more recent decisions, they all

15

start with and agree that the most important point is

16

congressional intent, congressional meaning and design.

17

There are several indicators in Title VI that

18

Congress did not mean to imply the creation of a private

19

right of action under the section 602 regulations.

20

first is that as this case comes to the Court there's no

21

doubt what the antidiscrimination mandate means.

22

agrees.

23

The

Everyone

No one's contesting Bakke, Fordice, for the view

24

that 601 only prescribes what the Equal Protection Clause

25

prescribes, so first of all it's a very unusual way for
12

1

Congress to work, to prescribe one type of State action or

2

city, county action and then somehow implicitly create a

3

cause of action with an entirely different standard of

4

review.

5

The second indicator of congressional intent, it

6

may be helpful to look at the statute itself, and if you

7

look at -- if you're interested, if you look at page 1 and

8

2 of the blue brief, our opening brief, I'd like to point

9

out some language that I think is -- well, we're obviously

10

a little biased, but close to dispositive on this

11

particular point.

12

implicitly create this cause of action, you've got to read

13

all of Section 602.

14

If you're relying on Section 602 to

Granted, it does create rulemaking authority for

15

the agencies, but if you look on page 2 -- it's about

16

eight or nine lines down, the beginning of a new

17

sentence -- you have the sentence that says, compliance

18

with any requirement adopted pursuant to this section may

19

be affected, so once again, compliance with any

20

requirement adopted in accordance with this section.

21

In other words, Section 602 does give rulemaking

22

authority to agencies, but it then says, if you want to

23

enforce those rules, here's how you do it, and the here's

24

how you do it creates special rules when it comes to

25

termination of funding -13

1
2

QUESTION:

Well, it also says, or by any other

means authorized by law, so isn't that the issue?

3

MR. SUTTON:

Exactly, Your Honor, and this is

4

critical.

The second possibility for getting compliance

5

with these rules is by any other means authorized by law

6

and, as the Federal Government acknowledged in its brief,

7

I think at page 11, that includes, for example, injunctive

8

relief so, for example, under that, at a minimum all agree

9

an agency could come in and enjoin the State conduct, for

10

example, the way Alabama is administering its driver's

11

licenses.

12

But here's now the critical second statutory

13

point.

14

that Justice O'Connor has quoted, that now says that no

15

such action -- the such is obviously referring to

16

everything they've discussed so far -- says, shall be

17

taken until the department or agency concerned has advised

18

the appropriate persons, here the Alabama Department of

19

Public Safety, of the failure to comply with a

20

requirement, has determined that compliance cannot be

21

secured by voluntary means.

22

You then have this proviso, exactly after the line

How in the world could a private individual

23

establish that a State is in compliance with a Federal

24

agency rule?

25

That's not something they have --

QUESTION:

Well, one way the two could be
14

1

reconciled, and I'm not suggesting that it's the best way,

2

but one way to reconcile them would be to say that the

3

private right of action is contingent upon the States

4

having taken the steps in the proviso, so that until the

5

State had notified, and until there had been some

6

conclusion drawn that voluntary compliance would not be

7

reached in the absence of action, the private party could

8

not seek the injunction.

9

MR. SUTTON:

But Your Honor, let's take the most

10

virtuous and earnest State Attorney General.

11

faced with one of these private enforcement actions, and

12

the private litigant does what you're suggesting.

13

first put them on notice.

14

don't think what you're doing is permissible under this

15

rule --

16

QUESTION:

They're

They

They send a letter, listen, we

Well, I was suggesting something

17

perhaps even more awkward.

I was suggesting that the

18

private litigant couldn't go ahead until the State agency

19

had said, you know, you're out of compliance, and the

20

State agency had come to some conclusion that voluntary

21

compliance was in fact not feasible.

22

individual could then go ahead with the suit, and one of

23

the predicates for the private injunctive suit would be,

24

the State has tried to get voluntary compliance and it

25

can't.
15

At that point the

1

MR. SUTTON:

And the point -- I guess the point

2

I'm making is that, take the ideal State Attorney General.

3

They get this lawsuit, and the private individual says,

4

listen, we'd like to give you an opportunity to

5

voluntarily comply, and here's how we suggest you do it.

6

What assurance, what guarantee is there that the State is

7

now in compliance with a Federal agency's rules that

8

this --

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Sutton, look at the sentence,

10

provided, however, that no such action shall be taken

11

until the department or agency concerned.

12

department or agency there refer to the Federal department

13

or agency in question?

14

MR. SUTTON:

Does the phrase

It does, Your Honor, and you're --

15

this is a better point than the one I'm making in response

16

to Justice Souter.

17

That language makes it clear who is the one

18

that's doing the advising, and if we're going to draw any

19

inferences from this statutory scheme, it's an inference

20

that whatever could be done under Section 601, under

21

Section 602, that was an enforcement provision for

22

agencies, enforcement provision in the sense that they

23

could promulgate rules to effectuate Section 601, and then

24

they could go about enforcing them, but as the Chief

25

Justice's question points out, it is the Federal
16

1
2

department or agency that they're referring to.
QUESTION:

Oh, I -- actually, as I guess my

3

question implied, I think that is certainly the easier

4

reading, but I guess I also think that if we felt

5

otherwise impelled to recognize the private action here

6

based on other principles, I don't suppose this would

7

necessarily stand in the way of that.

8
9

QUESTION:

Mr. Sutton, do you think the word

compliance talks about private actions as well as actions

10

by the Federal Government?

11

referred to compliance may be effected, as by the Federal

12

Government may be effecting this, but that isn't talking

13

about private actions, is it?

14

MR. SUTTON:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. SUTTON:

17

QUESTION:

I always thought that sentence

Do you think --

Oh, Your Honor, but -Do you read it that way?
Well, I do, Your Honor.
Even though -- do you think there's

18

an express cause of action, rather than an implied cause

19

of action under Title VI?

20

MR. SUTTON:

Here's the reason I read it this

21

way, and I want to make sure I'm answering your

22

question --

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Do you think there's an express cause

of action under Title VI?
MR. SUTTON:

I think there's a very good
17

1

argument that there's an overwhelming implication after

2

1986 that there is a cause of action under Section 601.

3

QUESTION:

No, that's not my question.

The

4

question is, do you think there's an express cause of

5

action, as opposed to one that we found in Cannon that

6

Congress intended to imply a cause of action?

7

MR. SUTTON:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. SUTTON:

Are you referring to 602, or 601?
602.
I think there's a very good

10

argument that there is an express cause of action for all

11

of Title VI.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. SUTTON:

I see.
After 1986, so post Cannon.

I

14

think that there is a very good argument for that.

15

it requires implications, but I think that falls under the

16

Atascadero point that it has to, if it's a sufficiently

17

overwhelming implication, then we're going to recognize

18

it.

19

After all, in 1986 they didn't create a right of

20

action.

21

State immunity.

22

Again,

All they did is, they said, we're abrogating the

But I want to make sure I'm understanding a

23

point that I'm not sure I addressed, and this goes back to

24

the compliance sentence about nine lines down on page 2.

25

It says, compliance with any requirement adopted according
18

1

to this section, and I don't know how one can read that to

2

say, you don't follow these rules when you try to obtain

3

compliance.

4

QUESTION:

Well, one could read it to say, that

5

sentence just refers to actions instituted by the Federal

6

Government --

7

MR. SUTTON:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

But it's --- compliance actions, which is a

fairly normal way to refer to the -MR. SUTTON:

Well, maybe this is my confusion.

11

When it says, any requirement adopted according to this

12

section, the requirement's referring to the rules.

13

Section 602 does two things.

14

rules, number 1, and number 2 you can go out and enforce

15

them, and it does seem to me that that requirement

16

language is referring to the requirements promulgated

17

under the section, and so --

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. SUTTON:

It says, you can promulgate

Well, why do you -I may be wrong.

I may be wrong,

20

but that is the way we think we read it, and we certainly

21

think, given the requirement of clarity, at a minimum it's

22

not ambiguous the other way.

23

quite striking.

24
25

I mean, that seems to me

If I could shift to a few other points, there
are some other indicators -19

2

QUESTION:

Do you concede that Congress has

authorized the regulations at issue here?

3

MR. SUTTON:

No, Your Honor, we do not, and we

4

think the better reading is that these regulations are

5

invalid, but as we indicated in our opening brief and our

6

reply, we don't think the Court needs to address the

7

validity of the regulations.

8

QUESTION:

9

Well, let's assume that the

regulations are permitted.

Make that assumption.

10

then, is simply an implementation of 601.

11

to be or we have a delegation problem.

12

MR. SUTTON:

That,

I mean, it has

Well, Your Honor, and that's a

13

possibility, but you still have the problem of rules of

14

the language in Section 602 that I just referred to that

15

suggest indicates that all of those rules were rules that

16

agencies were to enforce, not private individuals, so even

17

if you decided -- and I don't think you need to decide

18

this, but even if you decide the rules were valid, it

19

would still be rules that could be enforced by the

20

agencies.

21

In other words, if you thought -QUESTION:

But the substantive obligation that

22

the State must meet is a 601 obligation, as interpreted by

23

the agency under 602.

24

MR. SUTTON:

25

QUESTION:

Absolutely.
Why can't you say the suit is under
20

1

601?

2

MR. SUTTON:

Well, I don't think anyone

3

agrees -- I mean, I want to be clear but I don't think

4

anyone agrees that this suit can be characterized as being

5

under 601.

6
7
8
9

QUESTION:

I understand that, but I want to know

why.
MR. SUTTON:

And the reason, the reason is that

the Court has already made clear that Section 601 does not

10

cover disparate-effect legislation and, as Justice

11

O'Connor and Justice Powell indicated in Guardians, one

12

does not effectuate a statutory antidiscrimination mandate

13

by redefining it.

14

QUESTION:

But once the regulation is in place,

15

doesn't the statute then have a new meaning, as

16

interpreted by the agency?

17

MR. SUTTON:

No.

18

QUESTION:

19

authority to do this at all?

20

MR. SUTTON:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. SUTTON:

Or else why does the agency have

Respectfully, no, Your Honor.
As a preventative measure?
The most that can be said is that

23

you would be enforcing at that point Section 602, and

24

Section 602 is the part of the statute that gives the

25

agencies rulemaking authority.
21

I mean, that's the way

1

respondents have characterized their action, that's the

2

way the lower court characterized their action.

3

QUESTION:

Would the agency not have had any

4

rulemaking authority without Section 602?

5

have had the ability to promulgate interpretive

6

regulations --

7

10
11

MR. SUTTON:

That is possible.

Wouldn't it

In other

words -QUESTION:

-- setting forth what its own view of

the anti-intentional discrimination provision of 601 was?
MR. SUTTON:

That's true, and that's not the way

12

the case has been argued, but if that were true, then I

13

think it's fair you would need to look at whether that's a

14

legitimate interpretation of Section 601.

15
16
17
18
19

QUESTION:

Right, and under our case law it

wouldn't be?
MR. SUTTON:

Absolutely not, because Chevron

deference -QUESTION:

So the only way the regulation here

20

is valid is on the assumption that it is not an

21

interpretive regulation, but rather is a regulation that

22

goes beyond the meaning of 601 in a prophylactic way to,

23

as 601 puts it, to effectuate the provisions of 601?

24
25

MR. SUTTON:

That's exactly right, and there's

some guidance in the Court's cases.
22

In fact, it even

1

comes from the line of authority in which respondents are

2

relying, and that's the securities cases.

3

many cases under Section 10(b) and under Rule 10(b)(5)

4

where plaintiffs have attempted to bring a cause of action

5

that broadens Section 10(b).

6

Central Bank from six terms ago.

7

There have been

The most notable of them is

Another one, Ernst & Ernst v. Hockhelder in 1976

8

were both situations in which the private litigants

9

attempted to create a cause of action to Rule 10(b)(5),

10

which actually has an even broader source of statutory

11

authority, and the Court rejected them because they

12

created a cause of action that contained fewer elements

13

than the statutory right of action, and I think that's a

14

good analogy here.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. SUTTON:

17

QUESTION:

18
19
20

Is the same true of Rule 14?
Excuse me?
The proxy rules, the statute and the

proxy rules, is the same -- what you're saying now true -MR. SUTTON:

Well, Your Honor, that, of course,

is the Hagen case that you wrote for the Court in 1997 --

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. SUTTON:

Where I thought I -Under Rule -- I want to make sure

23

I'm answering your question.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. SUTTON:

Yes.
Under Rule 14(e)(3) you've got a
23

1

different statutory authorization of rulemaking power.

2

There, the operative language is that the agency can

3

promulgate rules that, quote, prevent the underlying

4

prohibition.

5

QUESTION:

But the rule, the regulation there,

6

the rule went beyond the statute.

It was kind of like a

7

prophylactic, and I don't know -- perhaps you can tell me

8

if there is any other instance of splitting the regulation

9

from the statute.

I mean, the private right of action,

10

the 10(b)(5) action, the Rule 14 action, they're all

11

wedded to a statutory text, and as far as I know there's

12

no distinction between, oh, I'm bringing it under

13

Rule 10(b) and not -- rather than the statute, or Rule 14

14

rather than the statute.

15

MR. SUTTON:

Your Honor, I couldn't agree more,

16

and I don't think there is precedent for that point.

17

mean, that, I think, is our main point, that if the case

18

comes to court, we all know what Section 601 means, and

19

that's why they have to characterize --

20

QUESTION:

But that's on your argument that the

21

regulation is invalid.

22

it seems to me we just decide Rule 14.

23

I

MR. SUTTON:

If the regulation is valid, then

But Your Honor, the implied right

24

of action inquiry is an inquiry that goes really to the

25

same question that you ask when you decide whether an
24

1

agency rule is valid, and that's what did Congress mean,

2

what did Congress authorize here, so it's true, if there's

3

not an implied right of action it may make these

4

regulations of dubious validity, but that's not

5

necessarily true.

6

The Federal Government --

QUESTION:

If I understand your argument, you're

7

saying even the Federal Government couldn't bring this

8

argument.

9
10
11

MR. SUTTON:

If the regulations are invalid,

that's true.
QUESTION:

Well, your position is, they are

12

invalid, therefore the Government couldn't bring this

13

action, either.

14

MR. SUTTON:

That -- it is our -- we do think

15

they're not valid, but I want to make clear, we think

16

that's a harder --

17

QUESTION:

You wouldn't need to worry about all

18

the argument about implied cause of action and all the

19

rest if the regulation's invalid.

20

MR. SUTTON:

Well, that is one way to proceed,

21

and we've argued that they're not valid.

22

easier way to proceed.

23

QUESTION:

That is an

But that's not the question for which

24

we took the case, and I'm assumingm and will assume that

25

the regulations are valid.
25

1

Now, are -- is it your position -- is it your

2

position that if the agency promulgated a regulation that

3

was an interpretive regulation which was not precluded by

4

our prior case law, namely, it didn't say that you don't

5

have to have intentional discrimination but it said, this

6

is what intentional discrimination consists of, and that

7

regulation is within the bounds of reasonableness that

8

would satisfy Chevron, is it your position that that

9

regulation also would not be able to be vindicated by a

10

private right of action?

11

MR. SUTTON:

That's a harder case, Your Honor,

12

but the reason -- I think the way to look at it is, does

13

the text unambiguously create this right.

14

doesn't do it, I don't know how a rule can do it by --

15

QUESTION:

If the text

Well, a text cannot -- you're -- a

16

text cannot unambiguously create a right for the agency to

17

issue a Chevron-based rule which is premised upon an

18

ambiguity in the statute.

19
20
21
22
23

MR. SUTTON:

I mean --

Your Honor, you're right.

Let

me -QUESTION:

The agency has no Chevron power

unless there's an ambiguity in the statute, right?
MR. SUTTON:

This question gets to the

24

distinction between my first argument and my second.

25

it comes to the creation of an implied right of action
26

When

against the State, the Court has always said it's about

what's in the text, so if the State is a defendant, then I

MR. SUTTON:

6

Okay.
If it's a private party, city, or

county, then I do not.

QUESTION:

It doesn't matter to you whether it's

an interpretive rule or a substantive rule, you can't

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER

16

ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE RESPONDENTS

17
18

Very well, Mr. Sutton.

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

19

The petitioners in this case are proposing

20

substantial changes in the law in a number of distinct

21

areas.

22

fundamental change in Federal-State relations requiring a

23

particularly clear and explicit statement that Congress

24

intends to do that.

injunction.

First, they characterize this case as involving a

This is a classic Ex parte Young

It's an injunction against Mr. Alexander in
27

1

his official capacity to restrain future violations of the

2

law.

3

This Court held in Will that is precisely the

4

kind of remedy that is not --

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. SCHNAPPER:

In what case, Mr. Schnapper?
In Will v. Department of

7

Corrections, that that is precisely the kind of

8

legislation that does not fundamentally disturb Federal-

9

State relations, and I think the whole line of cases since

10

Ex parte Young simply could not survive if that were the

11

law.

12

Secondly -QUESTION:

Well, that handles the Eleventh

13

Amendment argument, but it doesn't handle the Spending

14

Clause argument, you know, the argument that any

15

conditions you're imposing upon the States under the

16

Spending Clause have to be clear.

17

MR. SCHNAPPER:

I -- to which I'm about to turn.

18

They -- Mr. Sutton next suggests that there

19

cannot be an implied cause of action in Spending Clause

20

legislation, that any cause of action in Spending Clause

21

legislation has to be explicit.

22

and Guardians were wrongly decided.

23

Clause legislation, Guardians is this very statute.

24

both recognize an implied cause of action, and that whole

25

line of cases would have to be overruled.

QUESTION:

Well, that's sort of crucial to your

22

Spending Clause argument, isn't it?

23

MR. SCHNAPPER:

24

QUESTION:

25

I

It's not --

I don't think our cases say that even

when you're using your Spending Clause power to give
29

1

private individuals the rights to some Federal money you

2

have to be clear.

3

you're giving money to the States under the Spending

4

Clause you have to be clear.

5

I thought we only have said that when

MR. SCHNAPPER:

I'm about to turn to the State

6

issue, but I think a fair reading of the -- I think the

7

Spending Clause argument is, as they make it, would

8

encompass private defendants.

9

QUESTION:

Well, but the Spending Clause

10

argument is, as I understand it, goes to the fact that

11

you're trying to make a State a defendant, so Cannon can't

12

be dispositive of that.

13

MR. SCHNAPPER:

If the Spending Clause rules are

14

limited in that fashion, then that would be correct.

15

not -- but then there --

16

QUESTION:

But I thought you said to accept the

17

Spending Clause argument meant that Cannon had been

18

wrongly decided.

19

I'm

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Well, if you conclude, were to

20

conclude that the Spending Clause limitations don't apply

21

to private parties or to cities at all, then you -- then

22

that problem would be solved, but the next problem would

23

not, because this Court has been applying this implied

24

cause of action to State defendants.

25

Bazemore v. Friday, and in Alexander v. Choate.
30

It did so in
Those

1

were classic Ex parte Young injunctions against State

2

officials, and the Court had no hesitation in applying it.

3
4
5

QUESTION:

Did it explicitly decide the

question, or did it just assume it in those cases?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

I think it's fair to say that it

6

assumed it, as have the lower courts for years.

7

this is an established part of the fabric of the law, and

8

it has been for many years.

9
10

QUESTION:

I mean,

Did either of those cases involve

regulations as the immediate premise for the suit?

11

MR. SCHNAPPER:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Both.

Both did?
In Bazemore we relied on a Title

14

VI regulation, and in Alexander we relied on a Section 504

15

regulation.

16

QUESTION:

So in other words, you're saying that

17

if you take the silence -- this is -- I'm trying to follow

18

the complicated -- if you take the silence, and if you --

19

you either read the silence as a whole, just private

20

rights of action against States and individuals for

21

damages and injunctions, or you try to create epicycles,

22

or split the atom, if you're going to split that atom of

23

silence, and if you split it to distinguish between State

24

and private defendants, then you should also split the

25

State defendants to distinguish between injunctive actions
31

1

and damage actions.

2

At least, that's what you'd have authority for

3

under case law, because you have some cases, injunctions

4

versus States, and you have other cases, damages versus

5

private.

6

MR. SCHNAPPER:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. SCHNAPPER:

9

Right.

Is that right?
That is right.

In our view, the

provisions of the Eleventh Amendment and the sort of

10

penumbra of the Eleventh Amendment issue in Will exhaust

11

the federalism problems that are applicable in a situation

12

like this, and when you get to an Ex parte Young

13

injunction that problem no longer exists.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Schnapper, the two cases that you

15

said did involve regulations, Bazemore and Alexander, were

16

they?

17

MR. SCHNAPPER:

18

QUESTION:

Yes.

Did they involve a regulation that

19

could not possibly have been an interpretive regulation?

20

You see, I mean that's what's distinctive about this --

21

MR. SCHNAPPER:

22

QUESTION:

23

I --

That's what's distinctive about this

case.

24

MR. SCHNAPPER:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.

Here we have a regulation that cannot
32

1

possibly represent the agency's view of what the statute,

2

601, requires, because we've said what 601 requires, and

3

it doesn't require this.

4

Now, did those, either of those two cases

5

involve that kind of a regulation?

6

MR. SCHNAPPER:

They did not.

They did not.

I

7

mean, there was an authoritative determination of what the

8

scope of the statute was in the context in which those

9

regulations were invoked.

10

Petitioners have suggested that there can never

11

be an implied cause of action to enforce a regulation, or

12

I would have to say here as well a rule, because that's

13

really where this has come up, that contains a prohibition

14

not contained in the statute itself.

15

This Court has done that on two occasions.

In

16

Borak v. J.I. Case, which was decided shortly before the

17

announcement of the adoption of this statute, the Court

18

recognized an implied cause of action to enforce rule,

19

part of Rule 14.

20

Insurance case 7 years later, the Court did the same thing

21

with regard to Rule 10(b)(5).

22

actions to enforce --

23
24
25

And then in the Superintendent of

QUESTION:

Those were implied cause of

Those were a long time ago, weren't

they, Mr. Schnapper?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

Yes, but the Court has continued
33

1

to recognize that cause of action.

2

decisions reflected the standard for implying causes of

3

actions that were prevailing at the time the 1964 Civil

4

Rights Act was adopted and it's been the practice of this

5

Court, in addressing the question of whether it would

6

imply a cause of action, to look at the law that existed

7

when the statute was adopted, on the presumption that

8

Congress would have intended whatever result would follow

9

from the then-prevailing law.

10

QUESTION:

In any event, those

Well, it would be '64 to '86.

11

mean, you're relying to some extent on much later

12

amendments to the Act.

13

of your case, isn't it?

I

14

MR. SCHNAPPER:

15

QUESTION:

I mean, that's a substantial part

We have -- we think --

And at least by the time those

16

amendments were adopted, those earlier cases were subject

17

to considerable doubt.

18

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Right, but we think that an

19

implied cause of action was appropriate under the '64 act

20

as written.

21

QUESTION:

Without resort to the '86?

22

MR. SCHNAPPER:

23

Finally, with regard to the suggestion of the

Without resort to the '86 act.

24

petitioners, they urge quite specifically that a

25

regulation cannot forbid action not forbidden by the
34

1

statute itself.

2

several occasions, in Morning v. Family Publications

3

Service with regard to the truth-in-lending law, and in

4

Gemsco v. Walling, a 1946 decision with regard to the

5

minimum wage.

6

The Court has addressed that question on

Both cases involved prohibitions containing

7

regulations which clearly went beyond the language of the

8

statutes.

9

Gemsco again was the prevailing law at the time the

Both cases, they were upheld by this Court, and

10

Congress authorized regulations in 602, so it seems to me

11

that's appropriate to look to here.

12

With regard to the argument regarding the

13

limitations on the preconditions for certain actions under

14

Section 602, this Court has addressed that question

15

already in Cannon.

16

Congress clearly intended that the limitations in Section

17

602 on an agency action would apply in a discriminatory

18

intent case.

19

focus -- intentional commission was a particular focus in

20

1964.

21

It's important to note here that

Indeed, the -- that was a particular

The one thing that's certain is that Congress

22

didn't intend to permit an agency to cut off a State

23

agency or a city agency or a private entity from Federal

24

funding without going through all the loops set up in

25

Section 602.

That is to say, Section 602 applies even
35

1

where we're dealing with a Section 601 violation.

2

So the Court had that problem before it in

3

Cannon, and this very argument was made.

Well, but when you start talking

16

about Guardians, to suggest that it hasn't been accepted,

17

really nothing was accepted, nothing much was accepted in

Guardians, there were so many different opinions.

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Well, with all -- am I

21

QUESTION:

Yes.

22

MR. SCHNAPPER:

With all respect, there were

three different issues in Guardians, two of which were

of whether there was an implied cause of action was

QUESTION:

Well then, why were there different

opinions?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

Because the -- because there

17

were differing views as to the -- as to subsidiary -- as

18

to other issues.

19

covered intent, which separated Justice White and Justice

20

Marshall from Justices Stevens, Brennan, and Black, so

21

they had to write different opinions.

There was a difference about Section 601

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT UNITED STATES
GENERAL WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
For over 25 years, courts have afforded

5

injunctive relief against violations of Title VI

6

regulations against State officials as well as other

7

public officials and private officials.

8

consistent with the expectations of the Congress that

9

enacted Title VI, particularly considering the legal and

That practice is

10

social contexts that existed in 1964, and successive

11

Congresses have validated the private right of action.

12

QUESTION:

What social context existed in 1964?

13

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Well, among other things, Mr.

14

Chief Justice, the persistent practice of many local

15

jurisdictions in evading the dictates of this Court and of

16

Congress with respect to a variety of civil rights issues,

17

the most prominent one being --

18
19
20

QUESTION:

You're referring to what was -- what

various local jurisdictions were doing at the time?
GENERAL WAXMAN:

Yes, local and State

21

jurisdictions.

22

prompted the Voting Rights Act of '65.

23

For example, the kind of thing that

QUESTION:

Can you say anything about -- it's 35

24

years, and you said in 35 years everyone has assumed that

25

there is a private right of action for injunctive relief
38

1

based on a regulation under Title VI, but have there only

2

been like one or two in 35 years, or have there been a

3

lot, or is this the first time it's come up, or the second

4

time, or --

5
6

GENERAL WAXMAN:
against --

7

QUESTION:

8

GENERAL WAXMAN:

9

Are you talking about

You can say anything -Against States, or generally

speaking, because the answer is yes --

10

QUESTION:

Well, let's say against a

11

governmental body, however you want to answer it.

12

just trying to get an empirical idea of whether

13

people really -- this really is embedded in the public

14

mind or not.

15

GENERAL WAXMAN:

I'm

I think that it is utterly

16

embedded.

17

Mr. -- in two appendices to Mr. Schnapper's brief, but

18

with respect to States in particular -- I mean, let me

19

speak first to the regulations issue and then to the

20

States issue, which I take to be the State of Alabama's

21

principal points.

22

The cases, the decided cases are collected in

There is no case of which I am aware in which

23

this Court has ever even suggested, much less held, that

24

in determining the scope of a right of action, whether

25

expressed or implied, that a distinction should be made
39

1

between rights articulated in a statute itself, and rights

2

articulated in substantive regulations that the statute

3

mandates that the agency promulgate.

4

QUESTION:

5

GENERAL WAXMAN:

6
7

Well, one -This is a separation of powers

issue.
QUESTION:

General, I may -- I think I agree

8

with the proposition you start with, but one reason to

9

look at it differently now would be this.

We have --

10

since the statute was passed, we have taken a different

11

and at least in the minds of some of us a more realistic

12

view of the circumstances in which you really can in fact

13

infer a congressional intent to provide -- to recognize a

14

private right of action, so we're trying to preserve

15

Congress' expectations with respect to the law that was

16

passed under the earlier regime, but it's also sensible

17

for us not to expand that earlier regime any further than

18

it necessarily has to go based upon the precedent that the

19

Congress might have assumed.

20

GENERAL WAXMAN:

21

QUESTION:

That's --

And therefore there may be a good

22

reason simply because this is no longer the world of Case

23

and Borak, to draw just the kind of distinction which you

24

point out we never have drawn before, but which we have

25

never recognized, which we have never precluded drawing
40

1

before.

2

GENERAL WAXMAN:

I would like to make two

3

points, Justice Souter, in response to that observation,

4

with which I agree.

5

drawing the kind of distinction that's been suggested here

6

has very, very broad ramifications beyond enforcement of

7

civil rights statutes.

8
9

First of all, the implication of

If you look at the cases, either implied or
under 1983, in which private parties have sought to

10

enforce against State agencies obligations under the

11

medicare and medicaid statutes, those are regulatory

12

obligations.

13

The contemporary legal context in which Title VI

14

and the other civil rights provisions of the '64 act were

15

enacted, as this Court recognized in Cannon and, in

16

particular, in then-Justice Rehnquist's separate opinion

17

in Cannon, were enacted in a regime in which it was

18

understood that legislative silence with respect to a

19

statute that created substantive rights for the benefit of

20

individuals would be enforced by the courts in an implied

21

right of action, and that existed in regulatory cases.

22

We've talked about Borak.

23

somewhat later in 1982.

24
25

QUESTION:

Merrill Lynch was decided
The --

None of those, though, were against

States.
41

1

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Well -- no, no, no.

It's quite

2

right that those weren't against States, and Mr. Schnapper

3

has cited some of the Title VI and Title IX cases that

4

have operated against States.

5

distinguishing between regulations and statutes for

6

purpose of implying a right of action is that you will run

7

into this Court's decided case law under the medicare and

8

medicaid statutes whether under implied rights of action

9

or under 1983, the Wright, Wilder, Blessing --

10

QUESTION:

My only point on

Were those regulations that you're

11

concerned about regulations that plainly went beyond an

12

interpretation of the statute?

13

GENERAL WAXMAN:

14

QUESTION:

They were --

You see, I mean, that's what's

15

distinct about this case.

In addition to the fact that it

16

involves a State, you have a regulation that cannot

17

possibly be characterized as simply an agency

18

interpretation of the statute.

19

regulations that you're talking about of that genre?

Now, are the medicare

20

GENERAL WAXMAN:

21

medicare and medicaid regulations.

22

QUESTION:

23

GENERAL WAXMAN:

24

(Laughter.)

25

GENERAL WAXMAN:

I wish I were more expert in
My understanding --

I wish I were, too.
If --

I will gladly take guidance
42

1

from you, Justice Scalia, on this, but I believe that

2

those statutes, like others in 1983 actions against State

3

officials, involved both substantive and interpretive

4

regulations and, of course, if you were going to draw a

5

distinction here, it would drive a wedge right through the

6

heart of this Court's cases, including Chrysler

7

Corporation v. Brown and Chevron, that hold that

8

substantive regulations that are mandated by statute have

9

the force of law.

10
11
12

Let me go to the State point, the notion that
States -QUESTION:

My only thought, they may have the

13

force of law, but they may not have the force of the

14

unequivocal for purposes of the Spending Clause.

15

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Well, I don't think I can do

16

better than simply to repeat what I -- the point I hope

17

that I had made, which is, there is no case suggesting

18

that for purposes of enforcing a Spending Clause

19

obligation there is a distinction in recognizing a cause

20

of action based on a statute, or on regulations that the

21

funding agency is mandated to put forward.

22

principle --

23

QUESTION:

The

But there's no case suggesting that

24

there isn't, either.

I mean, I think Justice Souter's

25

point was that this is an area where there is no precise
43

1
2

authority one way or the other.
GENERAL WAXMAN:

Correct.

What we have on our

3

side is, I believe, a completely unbroken practice of

4

enforcing obligations under both the Spending Clause and

5

otherwise equally, whether they arise within the four

6

corners of the statute, or under substantive regulations

7

that are mandated by the statute.

8
9

Now, I understand that this -- that our position
puts great weight on the validity of these regulations,

10

but that point, as the court of appeals noted, was

11

expressly conceded by the State below, and we don't think

12

that it's at issue here.

13

With respect to the implication of a, an implied

14

private right of action against a State official, which

15

was Mr. Sutton's first point, Mr. Schnapper cited some of

16

the cases under Title VI and its cognate statutes, but I

17

think it's also important to recognize not only the long

18

line of 1983 cases, many of which enforce Spending Clause

19

statutes and their regulations in injunctive action, but

20

also the point that Justice Kennedy made in his dissent in

21

Golden State Transit for himself and Justice O'Connor and

22

the Chief Justice, which is that there may be instances in

23

which a healthy disagreement may arise as to whether a

24

particular provision of Federal law creates a right,

25

privilege, or immunity, but when what is being sought is
44

1

injunctive relief, prospective relief only against a State

2

official, the courts have long recognized a cause of

3

action under the Supremacy Clause, Sections 1331 and 2201,

4

including in Spending Clause cases which we have cited and

5

discussed probably too briefly in footnote 12 of our

6

brief.

7

Cases like Blum v. Bacon and Lead-Deadwood are

8

Spending Clause cases -- Blum was, even involved a

9

regulation -- in which a suit was brought by a private

10

party against the State official saying, look, the State

11

has a policy.

12

that operates in a manner that's inconsistent with Federal

13

law and therefore it is preempted, and the background

14

principle, the principle of law, I respectfully submit,

15

that Mr. Sutton is advocating runs directly contrary to

16

the particular cases we cited under Title VI and its

17

cognate statutes and 1983, but also this more underlying,

18

long line of cases that includes but goes well beyond

19

Spending Clause precedents.

It's reflected in a regulation or a statute

20

Our position fundamentally in this case is that

21

for 25 years, it is true, Mr. Chief Justice, there is not

22

a holding directly on point that says, you may have a

23

private right of action to enforce the Title VI

24

regulations, but there -- for 25 years at least there has

25

been a shared understanding among the three branches,
45

1

reflected in a unanimous set of, body of case law from the

2

federal courts, from successive congressional enactments.

3

In addition to the attorney's fees amendment,

4

the Rehabilitation Act amendments, and the Civil Rights

5

Restoration Act, Congress has enacted 11 cognate civil

6

rights statutes in which the funding agencies are

7

expressly directed to promulgate regulations patterned

8

after those under Title VI, all against a backdrop in

9

which, at least since Lau v. Nichols and running up to the

10

present, implied rights of action against State public

11

agencies and other public agencies have been adjudicated,

12

and the executive branch across administrations -- I've

13

pulled out briefs filed on behalf of the United States by

14

my predecessors, Robert Bork and Rex Lee, explaining to

15

the Court that the implied private right of action to

16

enforce these cases, and I believe that the former one was

17

in Alexander, which was a case against a State, are

18

important for the -- an important complement to Federal

19

enforcement officials.

20

Our brief in Darrone said, quote, the award of

21

individual relief to a private litigant who has prosecuted

22

her own suit is not only sensible but is fully consistent

23

with and, in some cases, even necessary to the orderly

24

enforcement of the statute.

25

If there are no further questions, we'll submit.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. SUTTON

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

5

MR. SUTTON:

Thank you, General Waxman.

A few brief points, Your Honor.

In

6

terms of the question of what vantage point the Court uses

7

in looking at this issue, there are many cases from the

8

eighties and nineties where the Court has not looked to

9

the date on which the statute was enacted for determining

10

whether it's an applied right of action.

11

Touche-Ross, involving the 1934 Securities Act,

12

is the very same statute that Borak involved, and it

13

didn't look back in time.

14

doing at that point in time.

15

true of Transamerica, California v. Sierra Club, and

16

Northwest Airlines.

17

v. Ash test which came 4 years after Title IX.

18

It followed what the Court was
The true is -- the same is

Even Cannon itself applied the Court

Now, as for the question whether Guardians has

19

resolved this, the last thing that Guardians resolved was

20

the question of whether there was an applied right of

21

action.

22

and plurality votes, you only had two justices agreeing

23

there was an implied private right of action in Guardians,

24

so that surely was not decided there.

25

Even if one allowed for the counting of dissents

And the notion that pre-1983 there were settled

expectations on this point can't possibly be true.

2

at Justice Marshall's opinion in Guardians.

3

identifies the split in lower court authority on the very

4

question the Court tried to resolve but didn't, so that

5

doesn't seem possible.

6

Look

Footnote 1

As far as the preemption cases that the Federal

7

Government is relying on, I think it's footnote 11 or 12

8

in its brief, that's a very different issue.

9

of whether a properly promulgated rule would preempt

10

State law is one issue.
