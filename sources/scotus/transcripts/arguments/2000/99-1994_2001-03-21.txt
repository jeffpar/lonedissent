MR. HOWLE:

were acting in a representative capacity for the state.
QUESTION:

This comes to us in the context of a

19

state official who went to the tribal court to get

20

authority to carry out a search warrant, and was given a

21

warrant with certain terms and conditions to go on the

22

reservation and carry it out.

23

that the officer did not follow the limitations in the

24

authorized warrant, you think the tribal court can never

25

have jurisdiction over those actions of the officer?

it's been divested.

3

QUESTION:

I read another brief -- a 1934

4

opinion of the Solicitor General who said that the tribes

5

under Acts passed by Congress had the basic sovereignty

6

that they had for generations, unless it was taken away.

And I guess for generations they could have sued people

assume a basic contract action would be within their

12

MR. HOWLE:

I

Well, Your Honor, first of all I'm

13

not prepared to concede that much regarding even a

14

nonmember in a private capacity, but with regard to state

15

officials, there are special considerations.

16

officials are protected, we know, with a certain immunity

17

which has constitutional dimensions.

18

that that in conjunction with the Court's instruction to

19

examine the extent to which tribes have been divested

20

implicitly because of their statuses as tribes results in

21

the rule that jurisdiction over state officials has been

divested.

Surely he'd be treated differently

if he were an officer, but unrelated to any of the state

But why don't you go the whole hog

10

and say that it's your position that it ought to be a

11

question for the state court and not for the tribal court

12

whether, in fact, he was just going in to beat up a tribal

13

member he didn't like, or he was going on state business.

That's doubtless going to be one of the issues in the

MR. HOWLE:

That officer would then have to be

tested under the appropriate standard for a private

citizen, and tribal jurisdiction over private citizens.

So then your view is that the

not within his state authority.

The immunity would not

10

MR. HOWLE:

11

QUESTION:

It's backwards, yes, you're right.
That's correct, Your Honor.
Does your argument depend on the fact

12

simply that there is uncertainty under the jurisdictional

13

standard as to how far the tribal court's jurisdiction

14

goes, or would your argument be the same if the statute

15

were clear beyond a peradventure of a doubt that someone

16

who was acting in what you describe as official capacity

17

but is being sued in his individual capacity would

18

nonetheless be subject to jurisdiction?

19

are you making this argument in order to construe a vague

20

jurisdictional grant, or are you making this argument into

21

something that would be entitled to prevail no matter how

22

clear the statutory grant was?

23

MR. HOWLE:

In other words,

I certainly wouldn't think that the

state's ability to enforce criminal laws off the

of comity for the supreme court to consider whether or not

MR. HOWLE:

uncertain, but it does refer to Nevada law quite often.

MR. HOWLE:

MR. ANAYA:

Your Honor, Mr. Hicks at this point

would choose not to take a position because in litigating

Right.

The way we contemplate it

10

working, if such an exhaustion were to apply to a 1983

cause of action or to the tribal cause of action in this

case, would be for the tribal court to immediately move

forward to determine the qualified or personal immunity

It seems very

Well, what we're suggesting, or what

6

the model would suggest, is that there would be the

opportunity to go immediately upon a determination in the

federal court, so it would be in the nature of a

interlocutory review.

opportunity to go into the federal court for a different

QUESTION:

for saying to the tribes that they could not proceed in

purposes of quasi-removal.

to proceed in their own courts.

QUESTION:

But where do they come from?

14

MS. MCDOWELL:

They come from the federal

reservations.

QUESTION:

So if they're going to have -- and

are we now going to have a new sort of federal government

QUESTION:

Then you have to think that the Ninth

case the case would remain at least initially in tribal

4

QUESTION:

What about the officer's position?

I

5

don't care whether they say it's tribal or 1983 -- I am

6

cloaked with immunity because I was executing a state

7

warrant, and that should be resolved in a state or federal

8

forum, not in a tribal forum.

9

MS. MCDOWELL:

I would disagree with that.

We

10

believe that the state officers' personal immunities are

11

matters that should be presented first to the tribal

12

court, and then only subsequently to the federal court.

13

QUESTION:

So that this case could remain in

14

tribal court if they just alleged tribal torts, the

15

officer says I have qualified immunity, I don't want that

16

resolved in tribal court, but it belongs in tribal court,

17

in your view of this?

18

MS. MCDOWELL:

In our view, in the ordinary

19

course the state officer defendant should raise the

20

defense first in tribal court and then would have review

21

of the defense under the National Farmers Union approach

22

in federal court after exhaustion.

23

QUESTION:

How far?

How far?

It's only under

24

the tribal code.

Qualified immunity is the defense.

25

what point does that get over into a federal court?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF C. WAYNE HOWLE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. HOWLE:

Thank you, You Honor.

One of our

11

major concerns in this case is the non-federal claim in

12

tribal court, because that's problematic.

13

the non-federal claim if there's no federal claim to which

14

it's pendent loses really in tribal court.

15

there's review of the immunity defense, ultimately in

16

federal court, there's no basis for federal court

17

jurisdiction to review the judgment.

The removal of

And so it leaves us exactly where we started,

That is a

derogation of state sovereignty.

treatment that the federal government would accept for its

own officials, and the reference I would make, if I may,

in the U.S. brief is footnote twenty-two on page twenty-

is set out.
