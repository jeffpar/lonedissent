ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE

11

Mr. Wallace and Mr. Hawkins, we

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WALLACE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The National Labor Relations Act confers

14

organizational, representational, and bargaining rights on

15

employees, broadly defined, including professional

16

employees, but it expressly excludes supervisors from that

17

protected class.

18

The term, supervisors, is defined in section 211

19

of the Act, which is set forth on page 2 of our brief, or

20

also on page 2 of our petition, and to be a supervisor

21

under this provision an employee must have authority in

22

the interest of the employer to perform one of 12

23

specified supervisory functions, or effectively to

24

recommend that such action be taken, and the employee's

25

exercise of that authority must not be of a merely routine

1

or clerical nature, but must require the use of

2

independent judgment.

3

In 1994, in NLRB v. Health Care and Retirement

4

Corporation, this Court held that the board had mistakenly

5

applied a special test of supervisory status for the

6

health care industry based on an incorrect interpretation

7

of the phrase, in the interest of the employer.

8
9

The Court held that the board had set up a false
dichotomy between action taken in connection with patient

10

care and action taken in the interest of the employer,

11

which is in the business of patient care, and in so doing,

12

the Court did not at all suggest that the problem of

13

reconciling the coverage of professional employees with

14

the exclusion of supervisors was an insuperable one for

15

the board.

16

It suggested some possible approaches that

17

might result in a defensible solution.

18

agreed with the proposition that phrases in section 211

19

such as independent judgment and responsibly to direct,

20

are ambiguous, and the board needs to be given ample room

21

to apply them to different categories of employees.

22

QUESTION:

It specifically

So there were those three phrases

23

that could possibly justify the exclusion of registered

24

nurses generally, and one of them was disposed of in the

25

earlier case.

There are two left, independent judgment,

1

and responsibly to direct, but the Government has chosen

2

not to put both in play in the present case, right?

3

independent judgment is at issue here, so that if you lose

4

on this one, you still have the third swing, right?

5

MR. WALLACE:

Only

Well, this was a determination

6

made by the board in going back to the drawingboard, so to

7

speak.

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, that's the Government, right.

I understand.

10

MR. WALLACE:

Yes, of course, but the board made

11

a determination that responsibly to direct in the abstract

12

need not be defined because it is always qualified by the

13

exercise of independent judgment not of a routine nature

14

in order for these determinations to be made, and early

15

on, after Taft-Hartley was passed, the board got burned by

16

courts of appeals in trying to interpret responsibly to

17

direct, particularly in a case called Ohio Power.

18

QUESTION:

The trouble is that hanging it all on

19

independent judgment is -- that's much the broader way to

20

go.

21

independent judgment if he is acting on the basis of

22

knowledge that is peculiar to his profession, or her

23

profession, in the case of nurses, for the most part.

24

What -- you really think you can sustain that position?

25

I think that suggests that no professional exercises

MR. WALLACE:

Well, the board I think quite

1

properly on the basis of textual analysis of this

2

provision holds that there must be a nexus between the

3

exercise of independent judgment and the exercise of one

4

of the 12 categories of authority that define who is a

5

supervisor, because that is what is qualified by the

6

phrase, requiring the exercise of independent judgment.

7

QUESTION:

But your basic position is that

8

professional judgment is not independent judgment, that if

9

something is required to be done, and any qualified

10

professional would do it that way, this is not independent

11

judgment.

12

It comes closer to routine.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, the -- if we're talking

13

about when an employee is performing his own functions,

14

his trade or his profession, carrying out his own tasks,

15

that is not one of the functions that makes one a

16

supervisor.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

No, but let me give you a

hypothetical, one that concerns me.
Let's say that you have a registered nurse in

20

charge of a health care facility, and one of her tasks is

21

to assign the other health care personnel to one or

22

another patient.

23

patient is in more need of help.

24

less need of help.

25

She says, we need more help here.

This

The other patient is in

That seems to me to be supervisory activity,

1

even though it is based upon her medical expertise.

2

That's opposed to the situation in which the registered

3

nurse is merely supervising one of the practical nurses in

4

the care of a particular patient, and she says, you know,

5

put a bandage here, you know, or give him two aspirins.

6

There, you're not directing the employee to one task or

7

another.

8

that employee is doing.

9

You're telling that employee how to do the task

Well, if the registered nurse is really

10

assigning all of the people, and saying, we need three

11

more over here, we need two more down there, I don't know

12

why that is not supervisory work.

13

MR. WALLACE:

Well, assignment is a separate

14

category in this, but let me respond more directly to your

15

question.

16

and had to decide which patient was in more acute need of

17

care, the nurse would be making a professional judgment

18

and carrying it out.

19

hands available with which the nurse has to communicate by

20

more than brain waves in order to exercise the same

21

professional responsibility, and this is a less-skilled

22

employee, and the direction to that employee once that

23

professional determination has been made falls into the

24

category of routine, in giving the directions to the

25

assistant, so that it would be in -- for purposes of

If the nurse did not have anyone assisting her

If the nurse has an extra pair of

1

dividing labor and management, which is what this is

2

about, in the category that also would include the

3

journeyman directing his apprentice --

4

QUESTION:

Sure, I understand.

I'm not sure

5

where you came out on the hypothetical I gave you.

6

that nurse who is assigning other health care personnel to

7

one patient or another, on the basis of her expert medical

8

judgment of which patients need help more, is she in a

9

supervisory position, or not?

10

MR. WALLACE:

Is

That would depend on further

11

inquiry about whether she is making determinations about

12

how the staff is to be deployed beyond direction that she

13

got from her --

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

No, no.

It's her independent

15

judgment.

16

have 30 personnel here, and you know, some of them are in

17

this ward, some in that ward.

18

are -- should be where.

19

where they should be.

20

The owner of the home tells her, you know, we

MR. WALLACE:

We don't know which ones

It's up to you to assign them

That would be much further along

21

what I think of as a spectrum between the journeyman

22

apprentice and the managerial employees.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, maybe you can tell us

24

when an RN, under the board's current definition, when

25

would an RN not -- would be an uncovered employee and
8

1

would be ranked a supervisor, so that she would not come

2

under the Act's protection.

3

Give us examples of RN's under this test who would not

4

qualify as employees, but would be excluded as

5

supervisors.

6

MR. WALLACE:

Maybe that would be better.

Well, it was stipulated that the

7

nursing coordinator here, who had authority to hire and

8

fire, and made staffing decisions about who would be

9

working in the wings of this facility was a supervisor.

10

QUESTION:

Isn't that just the question that

11

Justice Scalia asked about staffing, making staffing

12

decisions, who goes to which ward?

13
14
15

MR. WALLACE:
yes.

If it became comparable to that,

I mean -QUESTION:

Well, I thought in this very case,

16

and maybe I'm wrong, but there is a mechanism whereby

17

there's a registered nurse who's the building supervisor

18

when the other folks aren't there, and that that amounts

19

to about 72 percent of the time, in terms of total hours

20

that the building is open, 24 hours a day, and there is an

21

internal memo which states that these registered nurses,

22

as building supervisors, are in charge of the facility,

23

and all rehabilitation staff, and are ultimately

24

responsible for quality patient care.

25

Now, why isn't that using independent judgment?

1

I have a hard time understanding why a person under those

2

instructions, who is in charge, and the only person there

3

at the building, isn't exercising independent judgment

4

under your proposal.

5

MR. WALLACE:

Well, there's also a finding that

6

these registered nurses usually work on their own, without

7

any assistance in performing their duties, and the other

8

employees who may be present -- we're talking about the

9

evening hours when less is going on, are -- do not report

10

to the nurse, whether she's the building supervisor or

11

not, and are performing tasks that are laid out for them

12

by management in the facility, so of course she would be

13

using judgment in performing her own nursing services, to

14

the extent they're called for.

15

But what the board found in this case, the

16

regional director found in the representation hearing, was

17

that all that the building supervisor designation meant in

18

practice was that she was to try to see to it that

19

prescribed numbers of staff, and we're talking about

20

rather small numbers, were met, previously prescribed

21

staffing --

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, I am less concerned

23

about, you know, the outcome of this case, whether these

24

particular nurses were, indeed, supervisory, as I am with

25

the rationale that the board used, and the rationale that
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1
2

it used -- I'll quote it from your brief.
It is that an employee's exercise of ordinary,

3

professional or technical judgment in directing less-

4

skilled employees to deliver services in accordance with

5

employer's specified standards is not the exercise of

6

independent judgment.

7

Now, if that's the principle on which the board

8

is proceeding, it seems to me that would say that in the

9

hypothetical I gave you before, that nurse, who is using

10

her expert judgment to direct the less-skilled employees,

11

you go here, you go there, she would not be a supervisory

12

personnel, because she's using her professional judgment

13

to know, you know, which medical services are needed

14

where, and it seems to me she is a supervisor, on any

15

reasonable analysis.

16

In other words, I think maybe you have to take

17

the third swing, and go back and, you know, try to resolve

18

this case under the remaining test, which is, what is it,

19

authority to direct.

20

MR. WALLACE:

Well, what -- that standard that

21

we've articulated was based on longstanding board

22

experience with other employment situations involving

23

skilled crafts, team leaders, lead men, group members, who

24

they on their experience, or their superior technical

25

knowledge, direct discrete tasks to be performed by other

1

members of the group that management has assigned to be

2

members of that team.

3

who should be members of the team to perform the function.

4

This has come up in a wide variety of --

5

QUESTION:

They're not deciding for themselves

But most supervisors don't

6

necessarily decide who shall compose the people that

7

they're going to supervise.

8

management.

9

MR. WALLACE:

That's usually a given by

That's precisely my point, Mr.

10

Chief Justice, that management is deciding who the team

11

shall be and who shall be in the position of the leader.

12

QUESTION:

Why should the fact that management

13

gives you a team of, say, 30, be fatal to your position as

14

a supervisor, the fact that you don't pick them yourself?

15

That can't be right.

16

MR. WALLACE:

Well, if you're exercising one of

17

the 12 kinds of supervisory authority, of course you would

18

be a supervisor, regardless of whether management

19

prescribed the team, but that's one indication of the

20

limited role that the team leader is playing.

21

QUESTION:

Well, doesn't this turn on what the

22

authority to direct consists of?

If all the supervisor

23

has -- the purported supervisor has authority to do is to

24

tell the mechanic, no, turn the screw clockwise, not

25

counterclockwise, okay, if that's all he has authority to

1

do, you're turning the screw the wrong way, that's not

2

supervision.

3

But if, on the basis of his expert knowledge, he

4

says, listen, I want you to go over to this other job

5

which needs immediate assistance, I want to take three

6

fellows off of this job, put them over there, that's

7

supervision, and -- but that's not the basis on which the

8

board decided this case.

9

there's no independent judgment when you're using your

It decided it on the basis that

10

professional standards, and that seems to me to be much

11

too broad.

12

MR. WALLACE:

Well, it is qualified by the

13

degree of discretion that the particular skilled employee

14

or professional is given, and the degree to which the

15

exercise of any direction to others or assignment of

16

people who had been put on the shift to discrete tasks is

17

cabined by standards both express and implicit in the --

1

carpenter a lot of things, all about carpentry, and if

2

that's what's going on, that isn't supervision, because

3

they're experts, they're carpenters, and as long as

4

they're talking about carpentry, that falls within the

5

rule we're talking about.

6

Am I right?

And that describes the relationship between the

7

registered nurse and the licensed practical nurse.

The

8

licensed practical nurse does things, gives shots or

9

whatever, so that's the expertise point, but I thought

10

this case primarily involved two other things.

11

what does the woman do who is the nurse, let's say, during

12

the night hours?

13

around, like maintenance people or others, maybe she's a

14

supervisor, but there was a finding she did nothing.

15

She's just there, doing her nurse's job.

One is,

don't have to come, or she has little discretion there.

Now, that I thought was the key question.

with those substitutes who are coming in when there's a

22

shortage, that if I'm right, that doesn't have much to do

about.

seeing it, and I'd like you to correct me if I'm wrong.

MR. WALLACE:

I think what you have said

reflects the facts at issue in this case very accurately,

Justice Breyer.

QUESTION:

Then maybe your opponent will correct

me.

7

MR. WALLACE:

And the findings and the record

are quite clear that her responsibility as the building

supervisor is just to see that the prescribed head count

that management has prescribed is there, so to speak, and

QUESTION:

4

MR. WALLACE:

5
6

You may continue, Mr. Wallace.
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
If I may briefly mention a couple of other

7

hypotheticals along the spectrum which may shed some light

8

on what the board has to decide here, supposing a nurse

9

either has a broken arm, or has her hands tied up with

10

another patient, and another -- and a different patient

11

needs something administered that requires two hands, and

12

she directs someone to do that, even selecting from among

13

the staff assigned to her someone that she knows knows how

14

to do that, that would be very similar to the team leader,

15

the skilled electrician or carpenter who is doing one

16

thing and asks another man of his team to do the other

17

thing that's required.

18

Moving much more toward management on the

19

spectrum, if the nurse is anticipating a difficult night,

20

and can authorize someone to stay overtime in addition to

21

the regular staff, and therefore commit the employer's

22

resources to decide how the business should be run, rather

23

than what happens here, just seeing to it that the

24

preordained head count is met, that would move the

25

judgment much more toward the managerial side along the
16

1

spectrum.

2

discretion were cabined by rather specific criteria from

3

the employer.

4

Perhaps it would move back a bit if this

The task of the board is to place these various

5

fact-intensive situations, and we've shown them in many

6

other areas of the workforce, to place them accurately

7

along this spectrum and to decide where the line is to be

8

drawn, and if there is to be coherence in the

9

administration of the Act in this respect, it is important

10

that when the board reasonably does so the court defer

11

rather than second-guess those judgments.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, I agree with that, but

13

my -- again, my problem is, why is it that the phrase,

14

independent judgment, is the key to distinguishing among

15

those various hypotheticals?

16

Independent of what?

17

is, independent of the professional expertise of the

18

individual, and I don't see how that distinguishes among

19

the various hypotheticals along the spectrum that you've

20

described.

21

Why is that the key?

MR. WALLACE:

I gather the Government's position

Independent of managerial

22

directives, or the implicit understanding of the way that

QUESTION:

No, but with respect, it's not

3

independent of managerial judgment, because even in the

case where, in the first hypothetical, where she clearly

5

is not supervisory, she's just telling another nurse to do

6

this or that, that's independent of the managerial

judgment.

8

should do this or that, so it isn't independent of

9

managerial judgment.

10

It's her judgment as to whether this nurse

The position of the Government has been that it

11

has to be independent of her professional expertise, and

12

for the life of me I can't understand how that has

13

anything to do with distinguishing among these various

14

hypotheticals.

15

MR. WALLACE:

Well, because the exercise of her

16

own professional expertise in carrying out her

17

professional tasks is not one of the 12 functions of a

18

supervisor, and the judgment that she's exercising in

19

selecting the helping hands, if it's merely of a routine

20

nature within the meaning of the other part of the

21

independent judgment clause, would not make her a

22

supervisor.

If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of my
time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. HAWKINS

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

4
5

MR. HAWKINS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

6

This Court must reject the board's

7

interpretation of independent judgment and the definition

8

of supervisory status in this case in order to assure

9

Americans throughout this country that when they put their

10

loved ones in nursing homes, health care facilities, and

11

home care facilities such as our client, that they are

12

assured of an environment which will be supervised and

13

well-managed.

14

No one in this room, or this country, would put

15

themselves or their family or loved ones into a nursing

16

home or health care facility where, unknowing to them,

17

there was no one in supervision for 72 to 75 percent of

18

the time.

19

QUESTION:

But that's the description that the

20

regional director gave.

21

that the only thing that the building manager, or -- what

22

was the term that was used?

23

MR. HAWKINS:

24

QUESTION:

25

I looked back at it, and he said

Building supervisor, Your Honor.

she did was to make sure that the count was met, that she

had no discretion to order anybody to show up, that she

2

just counted how many people were there.

3

assure that the shifts were fully staffed, period, and

4

that she had no further authority than that, so those are

5

the fact-findings that were made.

6

MR. HAWKINS:

She was to

Well, Your Honor, all I can say is

7

that the regional director must have read some different

8

record, because he didn't read the record in this

9

particular case.

10

QUESTION:

Are you saying that finding is

11

clearly erroneous?

12

building supervisor is to obtain needed help if for some

13

reason a shift is not fully-staffed.

14

The only additional duty assumed by a

Your Honor, the way this process

works, this was our case hearing, and what ends up taking

22

place is, it goes to the board, and then they issue a

there were any facts in dispute in this case.

I thought, when I read the Sixth Circuit, that

MR. HAWKINS:

Why is it substantial evidence?

I

I

5

thought that the issue is whether the legal label called

support them, I imagine to some extent, and so we're

dealing with a question of law, and normally you'd say

22

This Court in HCR and Yeshiva, and

Yeah, a lot of them --- all these cases, is not giving

deference to the board.
QUESTION:

You mean you're saying we shouldn't

give deference to the board on such a question?
MR. HAWKINS:

No, you should not give deference

23

to the board in this case because their interpretation of

24

this particular statute is so irrational and so

25

inconsistent with the Act.

If you read the definition that they have of

independent judgment, and I would really address this and

8

tell the -- suggest to the Court that you pay attention to

this -- the board continues with employers to not be

proactive.

They just keep telling employers what it's

11

not.

12

if I read through the enter carpenter's brief you can't

13

find where they say what independent judgment is.

14

keep saying what it's not.

It's a shell game.

But in looking at their definition of it, and if

you stack that up against Senator Flanders' comparison of

He has hit the fact that you exercise personal

a few of these points in the record, and these are some

questions that were posed by the hearing officer herself

in this case.

18

Let me go through

In the record, it's very clear that there

19

typically was oftentimes one individual on duty.

20

was one question at J.A. 36 where the administrator was

21

asked, even if you're on duty, say, beyond 3:00 and this

building supervisor is there, what ends up happening, and

23

would you handle it?

like we're going to be a little short on night shift, what

2

do you think we should do?

is going to be asked of the building supervisor, not me,

the administrator.

5

as strong a granting of the right to independent judgment

6

and section 211 duties as any.

7

QUESTION:

In other words, the question

She's in charge of that issue.

That's

Well, that just concerns being short

8

on night shift, and that is really just a mathematical

9

call.

That doesn't take any independent judgment there.

10

You're supposed to have 30 people there, we have only 29,

11

pick up the phone and see if you can get a thirtieth in.

12

That's just not independent judgment.

13

MR. HAWKINS:

Your Honor, if you apply that

14

principle, then the vast array of supervisors throughout

15

the United States are not going to be supervisors, because

16

I believe, as Mr. Chief Justice indicated, it's very

17

frequently the exact situation, where management tells

18

you, these are how many people are allocated to your

19

department, you're going to get the job done, if enough

20

people don't show up, call people in, hold people over for

21

overtime -- that is an inherent part of supervision,

22

making those judgments.

QUESTION:

She wasn't given that discretion.

2

I understood it, she had to make the call when they were

3

understaffed.

As

4

MR. HAWKINS:

Your Honor, at page, transcript

5

206, concerning overtime without restriction, the question

6

by the hearing officer again was, so is there no

7

restriction on that concerning overtime assignment and

8

calling people in, and the answer was no.

9
10

Even a question at transcript -QUESTION:

What is the that, no restriction

11

on -- yeah, she was supposed to try to get them up to the

12

full count, and to call people, but where is there --

13

MR. HAWKINS:

But there's no -- the point there

14

is no restriction on overtime, and then at 208 she's got

15

the ability to call in to increase the unit above five,

16

and at transcript 334 one of the residence assistants

17

says, yeah, I've been asked to stay over and called in a

18

lot, so she clearly had those responsibilities.

19

QUESTION:

I don't see how to deal with the case

20

unless we're like a super-NLRB, unless -- I could go this

21

far, we take the facts as stated in the Sixth Circuit, you

22

know, and we say that insofar as those are conclusory,

23

what they actually mean, as long as it allows it, is what

24

the board said.

25

I mean, we'd go back to the opinions of the

board, which I agree is just a summary affirmance, so

2

you'd go back to the opinions of the district director and

3

say that's what the words mean, so when they talk about

4

it, you know, when they talk about her super -- how --

5

unless you want us to go -- you're saying we should go

6

read through the whole record and decide whether all

7

these --

8
9

MR. HAWKINS:

Your Honor, I'm not saying that

you have to go read through the whole record.

I'm saying

10

that, absent showing that the Sixth Circuit was in some

11

way arbitrary and capricious about the way in which they

12

handled this matter, they should be affirmed.

13

The other point I would make, and I would like

14

to propose, and I've been doing this work for some 25

15

years, and not unlike what this Court did in Ellerith &

16

Ferriger, it provided good determinative standards for

17

employers to follow to be able to comply with the law, to

18

define in this situation what is a supervisor, and I'd

19

like to propose six points for this Court that I think

20

address these issues.

21

One is that the individual in question should

22

have the authority from their employer to engage in one of

23

the twelve activities.

24

authority to assign, transfer, and responsibly direct the

25

employees by those definitions.

In our case, they had the

1

Two, the individual should be responsible for

2

other employees, a shift, a department, a unit, a

3

facility.

4

building and the shift, and of the residents, and the

5

facility in general.

6

In our case, the RN was in charge of the

7

Senator Flanders talks about that in terms of
direction of department, men under him.

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, and you say it was her judgment

as to how many of the extant employees would be in each of

10

the various units.

11

here, rather than just five, so I'm going to pull three

12

from the next-door units.

13

She said, you know, we need eight

MR. HAWKINS:

She could do that.

If the census was down in a

14

particular period of time, if it was up she had those

15

sorts of abilities.

16

QUESTION:

No, no.

Everybody's there, the full

17

complement of the staff is there, and you say she had

18

authority to say, we need more in this unit than they need

19

in the other unit.

I'm going to transfer three people to

this unit.

to call our attention to any other facts than those that

authority they have in exercise under section 211 is

7

different from those they supervise and thus not routine,

and I think that addresses the routine issue.

The fourth one is the

It also

10

when you look at the totality of the activities that these

RN's are engaged in, they're not routine as compared to

12

the others they supervise.

13

Fifth, that the authority to exercise does not

14

consist only of record-keeping or filing, and thus not

15

clerical, and sixth, in exercising their authority they

16

are not subordinate to those that they supervise, and use

17

their personal judgment based upon experience, training,

and ability, thus they use independent judgment, and these

QUESTION:

Well, typically isn't it so in

hospitals nowadays that you have a lot of subpeople under

-- who are not RN's but are LPN's, and then other

9

categories, and that the nurse on the shift would be

10

telling those people -- she wouldn't be the nurse in

11

charge of assigning anybody any place, but she certainly

12

would be directing the nurse's aides and the LPN's.

13

MR. HAWKINS:

Well, Your Honor, if the RN is

14

directing the facility, as this one was in this situation,

15

they would be a supervisor.

your definition, what nurse, assuming that the nurse is

going to give instructions to an LPN, to a nurse's aide,

2

challenge the Sixth Circuit's -- you say the Sixth -- you

3

agree the Sixth Circuit said there was the authority to

move.

Now, do you challenge that finding?

MR. WALLACE:

QUESTION:

7

Well, to --

You can answer that yes or no.

Try,

anyway.

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. WALLACE:

I -- the board did not make such a

10

finding, and I don't know the basis on which the Sixth

11

Circuit made the finding.

12

QUESTION:

Well, you have the memos in the

13

record, and to follow up on Justice Scalia's question, you

14

say that a nurse, one nurse testified she had read only

15

one of the two memos.

16

other factual basis for the board saying these memos were

17

not accurate, or were not used?

18

MR. WALLACE:

Was there other -- what was the

Well, they -- what the regional

19

director said was that paper authority differs from

20

authority in practice, and --

What was his authority for saying

to be when they were acting in the capacity of building

activities.

4

The board does have a procedure for review of

5

the regional director's findings, and that review was

6

denied in this case, and that is in an order in our

7

appendix to the petition for certiorari, which appears on

8

page 34a, because they found that nothing requiring review

9

had been presented, no substantial issues had been

10

presented.

11

There is a practice of not receiving new

12

evidence in the unfair labor practice proceeding unless

13

there is something newly discovered, or there are special

14

circumstances warranting it, because otherwise the

15

contestants in the representation proceeding would not

16

have sufficient incentive to present all of the relevant

17

evidence and get that proceeding decided accurately.

QUESTION:

Can I take it as some concession on

The Sixth Circuit says, they have, the registered

In respect to that -- that's the only one that

MR. WALLACE:

So I don't really see the conflict.
That is our view, and we have

citations on page 6 of our brief as well.

That is --

So they do have authority to move

people to make sure the head count is --

QUESTION:

Well, wait, I don't understand that.

10

As needed means to make sure the head count is there.

11

They have a full complement of people.
