CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

4

5

Martin Cromartie, Alfred Smallwood versus Martin

6

Cromartie.

Mr. Dellinger.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER E. DELLINGER, III

9

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

10
11
12

MR. DELLINGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In the Shaw versus Reno line of cases this Court

13

established two important propositions.

14

the Constitution does not tolerate using race as the

15

predominant factor in drawing legislative districts.

16

a district is drawn predominantly on racial lines, the

17

state reinforces harmful racial stereotypes.

18

message to elected officials that they represent only a

19

particular racial group.

20

The first is that

When

It sends a

Those cases stand also for a second proposition.

21

As this Court said in Miller, Federal court review of

22

districting legislation represents a serious intrusion on

23

the most vital of local functions.

24

important second principle is that Federal courts

25

adjudicating Shaw claims must exercise extraordinary
4

For this reason, the

1

caution.

2

this second principle.

3

this Court's admonition.

4

The decision below would severely compromise

QUESTION:

That ruling is inconsistent with

Mr. Dellinger, are you suggesting

5

that there is some different standard of proof of facts in

6

these cases or that we should not review a factual

7

determination of a clearly erroneous rule?

8
9

MR. DELLINGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, I believe

that the decision below was clearly erroneous, and we're

10

perfectly happy to meet the standard that the conclusions

11

were clearly erroneous. Because the court did not separate

12

out findings of fact from conclusions of law, it is

13

possible to read the opinion as if the court did not

14

actually apply the standard, but requiring a predominance

15

of race to be shown, in which case it would have applied

16

the wrong legal standard, but taking them to have found

17

that race predominated here, in our view that is clearly

18

erroneous.

19

I only mean to suggest, as this Court has said

20

in Bush v. Vera, and in Miller that because redistricting

21

is such an exceedingly sensitive matter that the Court

22

should be awfully cautious before they conclude that a

23

state legislature --

24
25

QUESTION:

That could be true, but to continue

the question that the Chief Justice asked, do we at bottom
5

1

have to apply a clearly erroneous test here to the

2

determination of the facts?

3

MR. DELLINGER:

Not if you find that when you

4

read the District Court's opinion that the court simply

5

wasn't applying a standard that required the court to

6

conclude that race predominated and subordinated other

7

conclusions.

8

predominance test, but that's not what it was applying.

9

The evidence that it adduced at best was evidence that was

10

probative only of whether race was one of the factors that

11

was considered here.

12

You can say, well, it did refer to the

QUESTION:

I frankly have some difficulty with

13

your position in the case because it is possible that as a

14

fact finder I would not have found the facts as the court

15

below did, and yet the court below appears to have

16

believed one expert over another and made findings that

17

may have been within its power to make, and how are we to

18

upset that?

19

MR. DELLINGER:

Justice O'Connor, it takes a

20

careful review because there is simply nothing probative

21

underlying the conclusions of the District Court.

22

out at pages 25 to 33 of our brief, we really have to go

23

through the trial transcript citations, the court says,

24

for example, that where splits occur in District 12 in the

25

six counties between District 12 and the other districts,
6

We set

1

the splits invariably occur along racial rather than

2

political lines, if that's a fact it will certainly tend

3

to show predominance.

4

District Court nor the appellees point to a single

5

instance of a split in which race trumps politics.

6

It's simply not true. Neither the

For example, in the plurality opinion in Bush v.

7

Vera, you find that in that case the Texas redistricters,

8

faced with precincts that were minorities, Hispanic or

9

African-American, but where the precinct itself was

10

majority Republican, went out and took that in, in order

11

to bring in the minority group, even though that was

12

contrary to the asserted goal.

13

of Bush v. Vera. There is simply no instance of that.

14

That's set out at page 917

The two big items of proof -- I am quite

15

confident that reversing the court below and sustaining

16

the North Carolina plan will not in any way impair the

17

vitality of this Court's antiracial gerrymandering

18

principle either on --

19

QUESTION:

You can say that about any number, no

20

one single decision would affect a stream of decisions,

21

but, you know, you've got factual findings here, and if

22

they're supported by some evidence, even though, as

23

Justice O'Connor said, perhaps we would not have made

24

those findings, they're not clearly erroneous.

25

MR. DELLINGER:

Let me go to explain why those
7

1

findings are clearly erroneous.

2

example.

3

courts say that this is completely consistent with race

4

and not with politics, the appellees walk away from that

5

and say that the lines are more precisely correlated with

6

race than with politics.

7

Let me give you one

The court says that -- or the appellees say, the

What do they cite for that?

They cite for that

8

the proposition that of the six counties, these six

9

counties take in -- District 12 takes in 90 percent of the

10

40 percent or more African-American precincts in the six

11

counties, 90 percent, whereas if you look at the

12

Democratic counties, even as measured by reliable voting

13

day Democrats, only about half of the Democratic counties

14

-- I'm sorry, only about half of the Democratic precincts

15

in the six counties are taken in.

16

that the lines follow race more precisely than politics.

17

That was their proof

But look at those figures.

They're set out in

18

Exhibit 309 on page 515.

There are 429 precincts in these

19

six counties.

20

percent or more African-American.

21

are the most reliable Democratic voting precincts, and

22

therefore they form the core of a difficult attempt to

23

create the Democratic congressional district in this

24

Republican area.

25

precincts which are the most reliable Democratic precincts

Of those 429 precincts, 79 of them are 40
Understandably, those

So 76 of the 79 African-American

8

1

are included in this.

2

Now, there are another 300 -- another 290 --

3

there 290 precincts, including those that are Democratic,

4

about half of those are included within the district, but

5

there's no need for any more.

6

included would, A, blow this district way past the equal

7

population point and, B, they are less reliable Democratic

8

than the 76 African-American precincts included.

9

QUESTION:

The ones that aren't

Dr. Weber was asked was there any

10

majority black district or precinct, precinct, that

11

conceivably could be included in this district that was

12

not included, and he said, rather astonishingly, no.

13

MR. DELLINGER:

That is correct, and he also

14

gave the following answer.

15

-- and Justice Kennedy, the reason that makes sense, that

16

all the African-American precincts that could reasonably

17

have been included are included is that those are the core

18

Democratic precincts in what is basically a Republican

19

area of North Carolina in the Piedmont Carolinas, so that

20

is naturally the core that is the overlap, and that is the

21

correlation.

22

He talked about how there were

There are other Democratic precincts, Dr. Weber

23

noted, that are not included, and he was asked the

24

following question at page 140 of the Joint Appendix.

25

Question:

Are the white precincts as heavily Democratic?
9

1

Answer:

2

No.

So that --

QUESTION:

You're basically saying that race can

3

be used as a proxy for partisan affiliation. And if you

4

say that then it seems to me that we're on collision

5

course with Shaw and Miller, and it seems to me that's the

6

heart of your argument.

7

MR. DELLINGER:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

No, I am so glad you asked that.

And it's just contrary to those

cases.
MR. DELLINGER:

I have to say that I'm so glad

11

you asked that because that is a misconception I most want

12

to correct.

13

race as a proxy for Democratic voting behavior.

14

We are absolutely not saying that you can use

QUESTION:

But I thought that was the whole

15

basis that you've just given in your answer to justify

16

what happened here.

17

MR. DELLINGER:

No.

With all due respect,

18

Justice Kennedy, that is exactly not the case.

19

districting process in which the state used voting

20

statistics of how people actually voted, not the color of

21

their skin, how did they vote, in constructing this

22

district, unlike the districts in Miller and Bush v. Vera.

23

Instead of using racially encoded census blocks, they used

24

precinct voting day election patterns.

25

This is a

This precinct -- these precincts were used to
10

1

make up the heart of -- these Democratic precincts made up

2

the heart of the Democratic-leaning district. It is the

3

appellees and the court below which point out to you that

4

those districts are African-American. Our response is, but

5

the legislature and its leadership told you that the

6

reason they were selected is that they were creating a

7

Democratic precinct, and they use -- it's absolutely

8

critical because we do not believe and do not contend that

9

you can sort voters into congressional districts by using

10

race as the criteria on the assumption that that is

11

correlated with political behavior.

12

what this Court said in --

13

QUESTION:

What we are saying is

And are you're saying that a

14

legislature can always defend a racial gerrymander post

15

hoc by saying that it accords with partisan voting

16

patterns?

17
18
19
20
21

MR. DELLINGER:

Yes, where the plaintiffs are

unable to disprove that -QUESTION:

So if it's easier to use race, we'll

just use race, just save ourselves all the trouble.
MR. DELLINGER:

No, no, because there is a very

22

great difference between using race and using politics.

23

This is Washington against states.

24

correlates with race, for example, in Batt and Hernandez,

25

the Texas case involving, requiring English speakers on
11

To use something which

1

the jury, it may correlate with race, but you can't use

2

race itself. You can't use being Hispanic as a proxy, but

3

you can use English.

4
5
6

QUESTION:

Did the court below make any findings

as to the intent of the legislature?
MR. DELLINGER:

Its overall conclusion was that

7

the legislature intended to use race as a district, and

8

that is correct.

9

QUESTION:

Supported by the statement that was

10

referred to in your opponent's brief, if I remember it

11

correctly, the red brief pointed out the statement of

12

Senator Cooper's on the floor of the legislature to the

13

effect that the plan that was being proposed was not an

14

incumbency protection plan, which lends obvious weight to

15

the interpretation that it was a racial protection.

16

MR. DELLINGER:

All right, Justice Souter, I

17

believe that was a matter of his objecting to the labeling

18

of the incumbency protection.

19

same sentence that the -- literally in the next sentence,

20

that the purpose of the plan is to protect the state's

21

existing 6-6 Republican-Democratic split.

22

bipartisan state legislature, a Republican House, a

23

Democratic Senate.

24

think Senator Cooper was only objecting to the terminology

25

and not to the fact that to maintain a 6-6 balance you had

He goes on to say in the

This was a

Neither side could agree to reduce.

12

I

1

to have a district here, but if I may respond, again, to

2

Justice Kennedy's very important point, I understand the

3

thought that, well, look, if it turns out if a legislature

4

does undertake to create a Democratic district, for

5

example, in a Republican seat like this, in order to keep

6

that 6-6 balance, and it turns out that those precincts

7

are at the core of it also happen to be African-American,

8

won't they simply have accomplished the objective that we,

9

you know, tried to stop in Shaw v. Reno.

10

The answer is no.

That was the use of race, and

11

it is also the case that when in most all instances,

12

perhaps not every, that a state undertakes to make race

13

drive the process, there will be plenty of evidence of it.

14

For example, you will find areas whereas in Bush v. Vera,

15

if you have, say, a Republican district that has a

16

significant number of minorities in it, we put it in a

17

supposedly Democratic district, so that shows it following

18

ways. That's how you prove it.

19

QUESTION:

Moreover --

Mr. Dellinger, there is some evidence

20

here, I mean, besides Senator Cooper's statement, which,

21

you know, you offer an alternate explanation for, but you

22

have to explain it, and once it becomes debatable, it's

23

hard for us to say that the finding of the court below was

24

clearly erroneous.

25

Another thing that has to be explained away is,
13

1

is the E-mail, Cohen to Cooper, as part of the legislative

2

exchange which refers to Greensboro black, that portion of

3

Greensboro at one of the two ends of this salamander, and

4

referring to those districts from Greensboro as simply

5

Greensboro black. Now, you say that's just shorthand for

6

those portions of Greensboro that were reliably

7

Democratic.

8

is a reasonable one as well, in which case it becomes

9

evidence that predominantly they were trying to put

Maybe. But certainly the other interpretation

10

together a district that had predominantly black voters in

11

it.

12

MR. DELLINGER:

Let me suggest why

I think that

13

is really utterly insufficient as being really probative,

14

to set aside a fundamental act of political

15

self-definition by a state legislature. This is a sentence

16

in an E-mail from a staffer to members that says that in

17

the districting context where they have to talk about race

18

because of the Voting Rights Act, he notes that the change

19

he has been making is that they're now going to for very

20

good nonracial reasons include Greensboro in District 12,

21

the Democratic parts of Greensboro, and refers to that by

22

saying, I have moved the Greensboro black community into

23

the 12th.

24
25

Now, I am not going to tell you that that is
without any probative value, but in order for it to play
14

1

any significant role in invalidating a state law, you have

2

to conclude first of all that it's not merely descriptive,

3

it's not like saying what are these new precincts the

4

legislature has, so this is a working class Italian

5

neighborhood and the other new precinct in your district

6

is a Jewish retirement community.

7

to read it as being an explanation of the motive for the

8

move, and you would have to assume that you attributed

9

that to the whole legislature, not to the staff or to the

10

two recipients, and you have to assume that that would be

11

evidence of the predominance of race.

12

think it will bear that kind of weight.

13

like this, to use a stray remark like this would be akin

14

to a stringent speech code where legislators who engage in

15

the sensitive redistricting process found state law

16

brought into jeopardy, and that's why there's very good

17

reason for predominance.

18

No, it is -- you have

I simply don't
A stray remark

The other way to prove a Shaw violation, if I

19

may turn just for a moment to Justice Kennedy's question,

20

the other way to prove a Shaw violation is quite simple.

21

When the state says we're using politics, not race, it

22

turns out that there are a lot of high proportion of

23

African-Americans, that's because they're reliable

24

Democrats.

25

minute, there would be a very easy way, more sensible

You can often come in and show, now, wait a

15

1

district that you could have created here that would have

2

been reliably Democratic, and this 1 through 6 counties is

3

completely unnecessary to accomplish that goal.

4

different district has to be more central.

5

showing here of a different district that would in any way

6

suggest that it was pretextual for the state to utilize

7

politics.

There is no

8

I'll reserve the remainder of my time.

9

QUESTION:

10

Very well, Mr. Dellinger.

Mr. Stein, we'll hear from you.

11

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ADAM STEIN

12

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

13
14
15

The

MR. STEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
the Court:
I would like to turn first to a couple of

16

instances of erroneous fact findings, clearly erroneous

17

fact findings.

18

The court below made the following finding.

Of

19

particular note is Dr. Weber's contention that a much more

20

compact solidly Democratic cross district could have been

21

created had race not predominated.

22

As Mr. Dellinger has just pointed out, no such

23

evidence is in the record that plaintiffs have pointed to.

24

Another one is the statement by the --

25

QUESTION:

Are you reading from the District
16

1

Court's opinion or from the --

2

MR. STEIN:

3

sorry.

Yes, District Court's opinion, I'm

And that was at 26A.

4

The Court also found that --

5

QUESTION:

6

testimony?

7
8

This witness, Weber, that was his

MR. STEIN:

That was his testimony that the

court was crediting in its fact findings.

9

QUESTION:

And you're saying that the court

10

could not have credited his testimony as a so-called

11

expert witness?

12

MR. STEIN:

Well, he may have been an expert

13

witness, Your Honor, but there was no showing in the

14

record anywhere that such a district that he described

15

existed.

16

QUESTION:

You're showing --

17

QUESTION:

But he did make that assertion,

18

you're not saying that the court --

19
20
21

MR. STEIN:

He did make that assertion, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

I just am trying to find out why the

22

court couldn't have relied on his opinion if he was

23

somehow knowledgeable about legislative districting.

24
25

MR. STEIN:

Well, he -- Justice O'Connor, he was

asked about that, and he did not produce, he didn't
17

1

describe a district that would be -- that would meet that

2

statement.

3

QUESTION:

When you say he was asked about it,

4

was he asked a question saying, point out the

5

configuration of precincts that would have produced this

6

less racially correlated and more Democratically

7

correlated district, and he was unable to do so?

8

MR. STEIN:

9

QUESTION:

That's my memory, Justice Souter.
There are some examples in the briefs

10

of this, is it footnote 25, districts that might have been

11

made, Mr. Stein.

12

MR. STEIN:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and the state

13

and the first -- and those are examples that the

14

plaintiffs have put forward in their briefs but were not

15

before the trial court, and there is no evidence that they

16

were before the General Assembly.

17

QUESTION:

But you're trying to discredit the

18

expert witness by showing that some of his factual

19

statements were unsupportable, and I don't think it's up

20

to the trial judge when he has an expert witness to, in

21

effect, do all of the scientific evaluation himself.

22

relying on -- that's why you have an expert witness, to

23

some extent, upon the credibility of the expert witness.

24

It especially seems improper to me when you're attacking

25

the validity of the expert witness on appeal in this
18

He's

1

fashion to try to exclude the districts mentioned in the

2

footnote on the grounds that, well, that was never brought

3

up at the trial. But you're trying to say that this expert

4

was not really an expert.

5

trying to say, and it seems to me perfectly valid to bring

6

in some examples whether they were brought in at the trial

7

or not, unless you think that the district judge cannot

8

rely upon the generalization of the expert when he says

9

this could have been done, you could have had a more

That's really what you're

10

compact district without including just the black

11

precincts.

12

MR. STEIN:

I would respond, Your Honor, that

13

the examples that are pointed out in the plaintiff's brief

14

simply prove the fact that no such district can exist.

15

They pointed out the swap of some precincts, Republican

16

precincts in High Point that they said should have been

17

made or could have been made with two Democratic precincts

18

that weren't in the district and Greensboro some 15 miles

19

apart.

20

If you look at the map that was attached to the

21

State's reply brief, you see that that would be an

22

unreasonable swap, and it was a swap that nobody had ever

23

proposed before the state filed its reply brief -- its

24

brief.

25

I would point out that there are other fact
19

1

findings of the District Court that are clearly erroneous.

2

The court said at page 29A, more heavily Democratic

3

precincts were bypassed in favor of precincts with a

4

higher African-American population, and this has been

5

explored, and as Mr. Dellinger has pointed out, that's

6

just simply not true.

7

were true, but it's not true.

It would be good evidence if it

8

The court also --

9

QUESTION:

10

Is there a difference in registration

and voting record?

11

MR. STEIN:

12

QUESTION:

I take it that's sometimes a

MR. STEIN:

That is a question, in that

13
14

No, Your Honor.

Even if you --

question.

15

registration is not as reliable as the voting record. But

16

if you look only at voting registration statistics, that

17

statement still isn't true.

18

show that's not true.

19

And the maps and the records

The District Court also found, and I quote, Dr.

20

Weber showed that, not just in his opinion, showed that

21

without fail Democratic districts adjacent to District 12

22

yielded their minority areas to that district, retaining

23

quite Democratic precincts.

24
25

And of course this would be an important finding
if it were true.

It would be very much like Vera where
20

1

there was exchanging of Hispanic and African-American

2

communities by census block back and forth, but that

3

didn't happen here.

4

fact, there's only one Democratic precinct of the five

5

that surround District 12.

6

separated from District 12 by the county line between

7

Cabarrus and Mecklenburg County.

8

no African-American areas even near that county line. So

9

that is an important finding, we submit, that the court

10

made which is simply not supported by the record and is

11

clearly erroneous.

12

There's no evidence of that.

In

That's District 8, which is

The maps show there are

I would point out that in choosing between Dr.

13

Weber and Dr. Peterson, it said that Dr. Peterson's

14

evidence was unreliable because it ignored the core, but

15

this Court said in Vera that the difference between areas

16

just inside and just outside the district is particularly

17

probative in this sort of case, and that's exactly what

18

Dr. Peterson did, but that's what Dr. Weber criticized him

19

for.

20

I would like to address an argument advanced by

21

appellees that was relied on by the court below, but they

22

offer it here in support of the judgment below.

23

that the district, 12th District in 1997 plan is an

24

inadequate remedy because it overlaps too much with the

25

population and geography of the former 1992 district in
21

They say

1

that it gives Congressman Mel Watt a good chance for

2

reelection.

3

We urge the Court to reject this submission

4

because it's inconsistent with our understanding of basic

5

Shaw doctrine.

6

ultimate question for this case would be, did the General

7

Assembly in 1997 act with a dominant and controlling

8

racial motivation overriding all political and other

9

legitimate considerations?

10

We understand the Shaw doctrine that the

QUESTION:

Well, that's true, but I must say

11

when your response to the -- one of your responses to the

12

allegation of racial districting is, no, this was

13

incumbent protection, and when the incumbent you're trying

14

to protect is an incumbent who was elected from an

15

unconstitutionally constituted district, that is the prior

16

district which was held to be unconstitutional, I think

17

that the defense of incumbent protection just washes out

18

to say you're going to protect this incumbent means you're

19

going to make sure that the person who was elected by

20

racial gerrymandering will continue to be elected.

21

that not a valid defense.

22

MR. STEIN:

I find

Well, in this case, the district was

23

different from the district that he had originally been

24

elected in, and in any event it's never been the law in

25

any of the redistricting cases that an incumbent for
22

1

instance in a one-person, one-vote case can't be protected

2

by the use of the core in those districts.

3

If this doctrine were to apply, it would only

apply to those minorities who were elected in districts

that were ultimately found to be unconstitutional.

I would like to point out that the -- in looking

11

at the basic Shaw doctrine of the decision -- it turns on

12

motivation, that the decision-maker in 1997, the General

13

Assembly is a different decision-maker from the body that

14

created the unconstitutional district in 1992.

there had been a good deal of turnover.

Mr. Everett, we'll hear from you.

Thank you, Mr. Stein.

21

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBINSON O. EVERETT

22

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

23
24
25

By 1997

MR. EVERETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
At the outset, let me suggest this, in the last
23

1

arguments, I heard some description of what was said by

2

the court, and I would request that the Court at a later

3

time look at the argument of opposing counsel and match it

4

up with the opinion of the court below, and I would

5

suggest there was very little resemblance between the two.

6

So that -- that needs to be taken into account.

7

Secondly, I think it's very important that near

8

the end of the opinion of the court in the previous appeal

9

of this case, it was pointed out that this case was to be

10

remanded to a court which was familiar with the

11

circumstances and would be in a better position to assess

12

the motives of the General Assembly than would be true of

13

a Court of Appeals.

14

Now, this Court set -- the District Court sat

15

there for two-and-a-half days and heard testimony, they

16

heard testimony from experts, they heard other testimony.

17

Pursuant to the authority that they have under Rule 52A,

18

they assessed credibility, and unfortunately for the

19

appellants, they didn't believe the appellants' witness,

20

and fortunately for us, they believed our witnesses.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Everett, there were whole parts

22

of the opinion after the hearing that were identical to

23

the opinion on summary judgment, were there not?

24
25

MR. EVERETT:

Oh, absolutely, Your Honor. I

think they may have been very identical, and given the
24

1

circumstance they were dealing with undisputed facts,

2

concerning such things as percentage of racial breakdown,

3

that need very little reason to vary them. The facts were

4

the same, they were undisputed.

5

regards is the same.

6

And the opinion in many

The court below each time recognized that this

7

Court does not wish it to be interfering unduly with

8

legislative matters.

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Everett, can I ask kind of a

10

basic question, prompted by Justice Scalia's question.

11

you think that incumbency protection is a permissible

12

justification for a gerrymander?

13

MR. EVERETT:

14
15

Do

I don't think it's permissible

justification for a racial gerrymander.
QUESTION:

No, no, someone who is just totally

16

incumbency protection.

17

political activity for the legislature to get involved in?

18

MR. EVERETT:

Do you think that's a permissible

Your Honor, I think it has been

19

held it is permissible, not unconstitutional. On the other

20

hand, my recollection of Vera v. Bush is that one of the

21

persons involved there was a lady who was in Congress who

22

was utilizing race as incumbency protection, and there was

23

held unconstitutional, so I think to whatever extent

24

incumbency protection is involved in this context, it

25

would be unconstitutional for many of the reasons that
25

1

Justice Scalia has stated, the derivation, but also

2

because in deciding to protect the incumbent, that was

3

really subsidiary to the primary purpose of creating a

4

racially predominant --

5

QUESTION:

I understand that, but assuming there

6

was no racial aspect at all, you would not challenge

7

incumbency protection itself as somehow politically

8

suspect?

9

MR. EVERETT:

10

QUESTION:

If John Smith, a person who had --

If people in power want to draft the

11

lines to keep themselves in power, that's perfectly okay

12

with you?

13

MR. EVERETT:

Your Honor, I think if it was

14

simply a matter of incumbency and nothing more, we would

15

not be here.

16

If there were no racial aspect --

QUESTION:

We so held in Karcher, the Karcher

17

case from New Jersey, didn't we?

18

MR. EVERETT:

Certainly, certainly.

So there

19

doesn't seem to be any question in that regard, but the

20

real problem is that in this instance, as the facts

21

demonstrate and the statistics apply to the facts, what

22

was done by the legislature was to take away more of the

23

geographic area of the 12th District than any of the other

24

prior districts, but to retain the racial core.

25

Now, you find that of the people who are in the
26

1

12th District in the 1997 plan as compared to the '92

2

plan, 90 percent of the African-Americans were there

3

before.

4

portion of the population, less than 50 percent.

5

pretty clear what was happening.

6

are two maps here.

7

although they are parallel, there has been some change of

8

territory with respect to precincts that are predominantly

9

white.

10
11

On the other hand, with respect to the white
It's

If you look at -- there

If you look at them you'll find that

There was none with respect to the core, the

racial core.
We find the legislature was using phrases, the

12

leaders of the legislature were using phrases like racial

13

balance and core, which in this context was a clever way

14

of trying to say we have reserved a district where it is

15

almost certain that an African-American --

16

QUESTION:

May I ask you one other general

17

question, and then I will be through.

18

motivation was predominant, then you've got to have strict

19

scrutiny to see if it was justifiable and all the rest.

20

Proving the racial

Now, why is it, I just have been a little

21

puzzled about the case, this was pulled with respect to

22

both the 1st and the 12th Districts.

23

1st, which was even more racially dominated, as I

24

understand it, than the 12th, the court said that's okay,

25

but not with respect to the 12th.
27

With respect to the

Why could there be a

1

difference between the two?

2

MR. EVERETT:

I might note two circumstances in

3

that regard.

First, the court did find that both in the

4

1992 and the 1997 1st District, race had predominated.

5

Secondly, they gave statistics as to the 12th District

6

which recognizes that it is one of the I think five least

7

compact districts in America, while on the other hand, in

8

terms of geographical compactness, the 1st District had

9

been remedied.

Then frankly, as I understand it, Your

10

Honor, it was not a matter of the motive, it was a matter

11

of strict scrutiny that save the 1st District, they found

12

there had been a compelling interest primarily I believe

13

to get preclearance.

14

QUESTION:

So under those circumstances -The compelling interest that applied

15

to the 1st District did not apply to the 12th District.

16

just never quite understood the difference.

17

MR. EVERETT:

I

Well, we frankly think the 1st

18

District might be unconstitutional but we did not raise

19

that issue on appeal.

20

the same token, there is much more logic as to the 1st

21

District in terms of the area involved. A lot of counties

22

there are over 50 percent African-American in population

23

in the northeastern part of the state.

24

virtually all rural, although there are some smaller towns

25

there.

We chose not to appeal it.

28

But by

That is all rural,

1

Here, on the other hand, you're dealing with a

2

district where less than 30 percent of the population in

3

any of the six counties is African-American.

4

any other district in America.

5

and every county was split.

6

America where that was done.

7

QUESTION:

We're unlike

They split six counties,

There is no other district in

Mr. Everett, the one thing that

8

puzzles me about that argument is in this footnote 25 in

9

your brief, when you try to answer the question, what

10

swaps could be made, and you give a few examples, and in

11

every example the result would be a more bizarre shape,

12

not a more compact shape.

13

substitution affects the compactness and appearance.

14

the legislature has already ignored those rules to such a

15

degree that further distortion appears immaterial.

16

only answers that you could come up with would run right

17

into this bizarre shape, you would make it more bizarre

18

shape.

19

MR. EVERETT:

You concede that by saying each
But

So the

Your Honor, as I remember, that

20

footnote we said something to the effect that since the

21

State didn't bother with compactness anyway, we didn't

22

feel that constrained in --

23
24
25

QUESTION:

But you didn't come up with one

example of a swap that would work to make it more compact.
MR. EVERETT:

Your Honor, let me come up with
29

1

several.

Let me point out that in the --

2

QUESTION:

They're not in that footnote.

3

MR. EVERETT:

There were in the plans and the

4

maps that were shown.

The history of the drawing of the

5

maps was before Dr. Weber and also the maps were before

6

the court.

7

compact and still would have preserved the Democratic

8

aspect of it, and it would have been less racially

9

gerrymandered.

There were alternatives which were more

The best example of all, Your Honor, is

10

the plan that was adopted in 1998 as a remedial plan,

11

which was only 35 percent African-American, which had one

12

whole county and involved only five counties.

13

Now, that one was much better than this one.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. EVERETT:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. EVERETT:

Was it good enough?
Was it what?

Was it good enough?
Your Honor, that would be an

18

interesting question.

19

time, but let me put it this way, we're gradually moving

20

toward improvement and the thing that bothers us about

21

this is you've got it down from 55 to 47, invalidated the

22

47 down to 35, and now back up to 47 percent

23

African-American concentrated.

24
25

We did not think it was at the

What's the message there?

Well, the message is

a pretty sad one, but anyway, even before the Greensboro
30

1

black community was moved into the 12th District, and they

2

didn't say Democratic, they didn't mention Democratic

3

anywhere in that E-mail, even before that there were

4

alternatives such as not having Greensboro in there at

5

all, not having High Point, not having Guilford County,

6

the sort of plan that ultimately emerged in 1998.

7

had a really good fall-back position, so that there were

8

alternatives.

9

result that was being sought by the leaders of the House

10

They

But the alternatives did not yield the

and -- by the leaders of the legislature.

11

One point deserves emphasis.

There were

12

different people in the legislature, but there was a

13

continuity of some of the people who devised the 1992

14

plan.

15

the '91 plan, the '92 plan, the '97 plan, and the '98

16

plan, who defended all of them as being -- or at least the

17

last three as not being racial.

18

For example, Mr. Jerry Cohen was the draftsman of

QUESTION:

Do we start with a presumption that

19

the legislature acted in good faith and for proper motives

20

in drawing these plans?

21
22
23

MR. EVERETT:

Your Honor, I'm sorry, I didn't

hear the -QUESTION:

Do we start with the presumption that

24

the legislature drawing a district plan acted in good

25

faith and with proper motives?
31

1

MR. EVERETT:

Your Honor, we start with that,

2

but after hearing testimony -- well, two things in that

3

regard.

4

After hearing testimony -QUESTION:

Your answer is yes.

Now, does it

5

totally drop out after there is evidence put in or what

6

happens to that presumption?

7

MR. EVERETT:

Your Honor, two things in that

8

regard.

First, is there a presumption when you start from

9

an unconstitutional base and say that that is your

10

starting point?

11

only from the legislators who were called on the other

12

side, but the legislators who we called, and the other

13

people who we called, and after studying the legislative

14

record which inevitably points to particular conclusions

15

in this case when it's considered in context, and when

16

considering points like that made in Arlington Heights

17

where one of the important ingredients is to look at the

18

history of what has happened.

19

together, you can say all the presumption in the world

20

about good faith, but in this instance, regardless of what

21

presumption you want to give, the facts as found by that

22

court after hearing witnesses and determining the

23

credibility is that the predominant motive was racial.

24
25

Secondly, after hearing testimony not

When you take all that

Now, back in 19 -- on the '92 plan, they were
saying it wasn't racial.

To say something is political or
32

1

incumbent protection is very convenient. It's a nice dodge

2

that has been developed, and it's a dodge that has been

3

developed because --

4

QUESTION:

Well, it isn't usually a dodge.

5

Legislatures constantly have -- are faced with drawing

6

legislative districts, and my own experience is that the

7

motive in most cases is political in drawing those

8

boundaries.

9

MR. EVERETT:

Your Honor, it is political in

10

many instances, but on the other hand if you have a strong

11

racial minority well-positioned in a particular political

12

party, they can say, as we think the evidence indicates

13

was said in this case, and remember that the 1st and the

14

12th Districts were really the first two that they started

15

with.

16

They can say, we want a district where we can be assured

17

that a minority candidate will be nominated and will be

18

elected.

19

Then they began worrying about some other things.

Now, in North Carolina, given the legal

20

constraints and given the primary situation, you need to

21

have really about 40, 45 percent to be perfectly sure.

22

the other hand, with 35 percent, Congressman Watt has been

23

readily reelected by huge majorities, but in any event if

24

you put it in context, there was a primary purpose with

25

respect to the 1st and the 12th to create for a racial
33

On

1

motive and to draw lines on racial grounds and give the

2

message that was condemned in Shaw v. Reno.

3

message where if you look at statistics and you are

4

resident of those areas and know anything about them, you

5

come to the conclusions that we had six witnesses come to,

6

to the effect it was predominantly racially motivated, so

7

that putting it all in context --

9
10

QUESTION:

This is a

Mr. Everett, when you're over there,

would you point out to us where on the map District 12 is.
MR. EVERETT:

All right.

Here is the old '92

11

map, and let me just show you here's Guilford County.

12

Guilford County has the Greensboro black community.

13

Greensboro black community would be up at this -- I'm

14

sorry if you can't all see it, and by the way, there is a

15

map -- these maps are in the -- right at beginning, near

16

the beginning of Volume 2 of the Joint Appendix.

17

You have Guilford, which was added on out of the

18

whole county, Greensboro was the second stage, the

19

Greensboro black community.

20

Point black community.

21

alternative proposals similar to those --

23
24
25

The

QUESTION:

Before this they had the High

Now, meanwhile, there were

Could you just tell us, is it the

yellow district?
MR. EVERETT:
pardon, Your Honor.

It's the yellow, I beg your

There is yellow running here from
34

1

Mecklenburg down near the South Carolina line.

2
3

QUESTION:

And Mecklenburg is the county that

Charlotte is in?

4

MR. EVERETT:

Mecklenburg is where Charlotte is,

5

and this is viewed as the hub for these particular

6

purposes.

7

QUESTION:

Your expert, Mr. Weber, said that the

8

defendant's expert, Mr. Peterson, used an unconventional,

9

untried theory.

Because as I understood it, the criticism

10

was that he concentrated only on the fringe districts and

11

not the core, but I thought it was the fringe districts

12

that were the problem here.

13

MR. EVERETT:

Your Honor, when you read the

14

affidavit -- I would suggest apropos of Weber's criticism

15

of Peterson's analysis and the segment analysis, if you

16

read, I think it's 302 to 307 or 8 in the Joint Appendix,

17

you will find, I think, a devastating criticism by Weber

18

of Peterson.

19

is totally unreliable because it places emphasis on almost

20

infinitesimal differentiations between adjacent precincts,

21

ignoring the number of people that are involved of

22

African-American or white race.

23
24
25

He shows why this boundary segment analysis

Secondly, he points out, that it ignores the
entire core.
QUESTION:

But I thought that's what you wanted
35

1

to ignore?

2

MR. EVERETT:

3

QUESTION:

4

ignore.

I'm sorry?

I thought that's what you wanted to

5

Or am I missing something?
MR. EVERETT:

We think in the analysis, that you

6

look at the core, and then you determine if they were

7

trying to get the racial core, why it is that they drew it

8

in the particular manner, and that is what Dr. Weber

9

stressed.

I think if you look at his report, look at his

10

responses under cross-examination, look at his background

11

as someone who has done a large number of redistricting

12

cases, and then look at the curriculum vitae of Dr.

13

Peterson, who has done no redistricting cases, look at the

14

circumstances in his boundary analysis has received no

15

peer review, has not been utilized in any other case, you

16

will understand readily why the court, even apart from

17

credibility, which was a better witness, decided to

18

believe the analysis by Dr. Weber and to reject the

19

analysis by Dr. Peterson.

20

QUESTION:

One other point.

The appellants say

21

that the court's just wrong or the expert's just wrong to

22

say there were more heavily Democratic precincts with

23

white populations, with heavier white populations that

24

were excluded.

25

there is just no basis for that.

In oral argument this morning they said

36

1

MR. EVERETT:

Well, the basis -- they make the

2

point that there's no basis for it.

3

report, read the examination, you understand quite readily

4

that there's adequate basis for saying that the primary

5

consideration in drawing these districts was to group

6

these African-American precincts, that was the primary

7

purpose, and the circumstances --

8
9

QUESTION:

If you read the

No, but they say the proof for that

purpose, according to your expert, is that there were some

10

we'll call them mixed districts that were heavily

11

Democratic that were excluded, and they said that is just

12

not so.

13
14

MR. EVERETT:

17

We would

submit --

15
16

Well, we disagree.

QUESTION:

Where do I look to find if that's so

or not?
MR. EVERETT:

We would submit that from the

18

exhibits we've submitted including maps that show

19

precincts that could have been readily added in, that

20

their statement --

21
22
23

QUESTION:

Are those other than the ones in the

footnote 25?
MR. EVERETT:

Your Honor, I think there are

24

other -- I think there are maps there in addition.

25

look at the maps beginning in Volume 2, you'll see several
37

If you

1

maps that we think tend to support the position --

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. EVERETT:

4

I going to ask you about the maps.
In the footnote there is a

reference to other --

5

QUESTION:

I'm just awed that you would think

6

you would pick your best cases to give to supply the

7

missing link in the experts' testimony, and yet the ones

8

that you pick as your presumably best cases all make this

9

district even odder shape than it's ever been.

10

MR. EVERETT:

Your Honor, my recollection is

11

that the expert, Dr. Weber, testified that he had looked

12

at a number of maps and there were alternatives.

13

recall -- apparently opposing counsel does -- his being

14

asked to identify particular maps that would be usable.

15

We know from the history that there were maps

I do not

16

that were in existence that were used in evolving the plan

17

that was ultimately used.

MR. EVERETT:

I'm sorry, Your Honor, I can't

hear.
QUESTION:

There is one traditional criterion
38

1

that you don't mention, and that at least some people in

2

the Senate gave credence to, and that is linking together

3

the cities that had commonality of interest, a community

4

of interest in problems like health care and housing and

5

deteriorating public schools.

6

from each other, but they're all cities with those

7

problems that are common to the urban poor.

8
9

MR. EVERETT:

They may have been distant

Your Honor, you really have raised

a point that I think is significant from our standpoint.

10

In terms of community of interest, what was done was take

11

cities like Greensboro, High Point, Winston-Salem, and

12

Charlotte, among the largest cities in North Carolina,

13

Charlotte is the largest, and divided the population

14

between white and black.

15

Now, the white citizens on one side of that line

16

have the same interests, they listen to the same TV shows,

17

they read the same newspapers.

18

commonality than the African-American in Charlotte has

19

with the African-American in, let's say, Greensboro.

20

If you look at it in terms of community of

They have a much more

21

interest, then this splitting, the splitting of cities is

22

irreconcilable to that concept of community of interest.

23

Moreover --

24
25

QUESTION:
true.

I'm not a hundred percent sure that's

I can think of some areas of this city that might
39

1

have more in common with areas of, say, Boston than with

2

each other.

3

Northwest in Washington, D.C. in the same city but perhaps

4

it's a greater commonality of interest with other cities,

5

with similar populations in other cities.

6

Take the difference between Anacostia and

MR. EVERETT:

Well, Your Honor, given the

7

circumstance of different standard metropolitan areas,

8

you've got large concentration up at the north of

9

African-Americans, a large concentration down toward the

10

south in Charlotte.

11

QUESTION:

You know any other state, Mr.

12

Robinson, that has chosen to divide its electorate into

13

urban dwellers and rural dwellers?

14

MR. EVERETT:

I'm not aware of anything which in

15

this context could define similarity, community of

16

interest among urban dwellers.

17

QUESTION:

And this wouldn't be an unusual

18

district if other states linked their major cities with a

19

ribbon in between to make it contiguous?

20

MR. EVERETT:

Well, here what they've done is

21

link portions of urban areas with rural connectives, and

22

the rural connectives are basically white fillers.

23

don't know of any other situation at the present time that

24

corresponds to that in other districts.

25

still a unique district, unique in so many ways and unique
40

And I

I think this is

1

in sending a very clear message that race is

2

predominating.

3

QUESTION:

One of your arguments the first time

4

was that race was predominant because they kept heavily

5

Democratic districts out but they put less Democratic

6

African-American district precincts in, right?

7

the first time you argued, when you were here before, one

8

of your arguments was --

9
10

MR. EVERETT:

That was

Referring to when I was here in

Hunt v. Cromartie, not --

11

QUESTION:

Yeah, I mean this side, this side.

12

And then in response -- am I right so far that one of the

13

main arguments was, look, this is not Democrats, this is

14

race, and you can show it by looking at the heavily

15

Democratic districts that they left out and the heavily

16

less Democratic, the heavily African-Americans that they

17

put in.

18

That's the argument.
And what this Court said in response is, wait a

19

minute, if you're going to argue that, don't measure it by

20

registration, measure it by how people vote because a lot

21

of registered Democrats vote Republican.

22

Court said in its opinion.

23
24
25

MR. EVERETT:

That's what this

Is that fair?

I think that was certainly one of

the points raised.
QUESTION:

And now when I look at the district
41

1

judge's opinion, one of his points, one of them was not

2

just the war of experts.

3

it, he says it, one of them, like 21 or where is it here?

4

He says it specifically.

5

evidence shows that the more heavily Democratic precincts

6

are bypassed, i.e. they're out, in favor of the more

7

heavily African-American, which are in.

8
9
10
11

One of them was -- and he says

He says that additionally, the

When I look to what he based that on on page 13A
and 14, it is two pages -- registration, registration,
registration.

Just what we said he shouldn't use.

And then I looked at your maps, which very

12

honestly, are not registration, they are how people really

13

vote, and the yellows are the Democrats and the yellows

14

are in, in, in, and there are just a handful of the

15

hundred precincts that are out.

16

So what am I supposed to do about that finding?

17

It looks as that finding is a finding that's based on the

18

very thing we said not to use -- registration.

19

MR. EVERETT:

20

QUESTION:

I think it's all right when it seems

21

to work the other way.

22

there's a chance.

23

Your Honor --

MR. EVERETT:

I wanted to get your response if

Your Honor, I think you said --

24

you're there to look at other considerations.

25

think you said registration was totally out.
42

I don't

1

QUESTION:

No, no, it's not out, but they said

2

don't do registration alone, and so when I looked at pages

3

13A and 14, it looked to me in that appendix that for that

4

point the judge is using registration alone, and when I

5

looked at your maps, which are not registration alone, it

6

looked to me as if all the Democratic precincts are in

7

except for a handful.

8
9

MR. EVERETT:

Well, it depends what you mean by

handful, particularly in the context of large cities where

10

they're glued together.

11

and in Greensboro.

12

Weber that he had looked at all three aspects -- he looked

13

at the three elections which had been considered by the

14

General Assembly and were before them, and came to the

15

same conclusion. This was all grouped under party

16

affiliation.

17

In Charlotte, in Winston-Salem,

I believe there was testimony by Dr.

So he certainly came to that conclusion.

The Court may have pointed out simply a few that

18

were left out, and maybe there were only a few.

19

was a lot of evidence that was generated by Dr. Weber that

20

concerned the primacy of race as a motive over politics.

21

So I think, if you look at it in context, Your

22

Honor, and look at the other things, look at some of the

23

statements in the record, look at what we termed the

24

smoking gun, the E-mail, look at the testimony of the

25

legislators who we called and other persons who we called,
43

But there

1

when you take all that together, it seems to us just

2

unmistakably clear that this Court which was familiar with

3

the circumstances and which was familiar with the motives

4

of the workings of the General Assembly came to a

5

permissible conclusion.

6

One other thing that deserves note.

Given the

7

use of pretext, and the Court found that one of the

8

persons on one aspect of testimony was simply not

9

credible, you have a very significant circumstantial

10

evidence, maybe it's more than that, the use of pretext,

11

as I recall from the Reeves case that was decided this

12

summer can itself be positive evidence of a particular

13

state of mind, and we would submit that the pattern

14

followed by the State in terms of concealment, excuses,

15

and it's a pattern that continues from the past in respect

16

to the 1992 plan, that this in itself is evidence.

17

take the whole thing, you look at what they were doing

18

with the 1st District where they were concentrating on

19

percentages, you look at the district here, District 12,

20

where it was announced to the Senate by Senator Cooper

21

that as long as they were under 50 percent they were home

22

free, and then look at the way they increased the

23

percentages.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER E. DELLINGER, III

2

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

3

MR. DELLINGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, if you look

4

at the map and with some understanding of the demographics

5

of North Carolina, you can see that the bipartisan

6

legislature faced a difficult task in attempting to create

7

a sixth Democratic-leaning congressional district in this

8

part of the state.

9

One of the joys of North Carolina is that we

10

don't have a big metropolitan area like Atlanta. We have a

11

nice string of more medium-sized cities, and Charlotte

12

running through.

13
14
15

So you simply take North Carolina --

QUESTION:

Charlotte is about a million, isn't

it?
MR. DELLINGER:

It's getting too big for my

16

taste, but it's -- but the -- they accomplish this in

17

every instance by creating districts, one for the

18

Republican Sue Myrick in Mecklenburg county and one for

19

the Democrat Mel Watt, each a rising star.

20

thought Mecklenburg should be entirely within one

21

district, but Charlotte is very happy to have rising stars

22

in each party represent Charlotte, and neither of the

23

political parties wanted to cede Charlotte to the other.

24
25

Their expert

So you really have an expert who is making
political judgments.
45

1

This case may be your final opportunity to

2

address redistricting before the 2000 -- post-2000

3

redistricting occurs, and I think it's worth asking again

4

why is predominance the standard.

5

consistently rejected the idea that any consideration of

6

race, however small, should trigger strict scrutiny.

7

That's properly because of the nature of the Shaw harm.

8
9

The Court has

The Shaw harm is not hostility towards
individuals.

It is communication of a message that people

10

are defined by their race, and when race predominates, you

11

have the Shaw harm.

12

To move to a more extreme exclusion of race

13

would create a hair trigger in which legislatures would be

14

completely uncertain of their ability to legislate.

15

have judges creating election districts and rather than

16

state legislatures doing this critically important task

17

that involves political judgment, we usually say plans

that do not cause expressive harms should not be declared

unlawful.
