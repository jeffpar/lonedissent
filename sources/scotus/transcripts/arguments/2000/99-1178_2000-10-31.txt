ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY S. BISHOP

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

9

MR. BISHOP:

Mr.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court, by 1972 the terms navigable waters and

11

waters of the United States had a settled meaning after a

12

century during which congresses and this Court's

13

conception of what those terms meant had expanded

14

significantly from an initial strict view that the

15

navigable waters were those navigable, in fact, to a

16

recognition that they included in addition waters

17

navigable with improvements and tributaries of those

18

waters, to this Court's statement in the Union Electric

19

case in 1965 that the only things excluded were intrastate

20

non-navigable waters that did not flow into the navigable

21

waters.

22

By 1972, when the act was passed, the broadest

23

conception of the navigable waters of the United States

24

included all waters that form part of a single aquatic

25

system with navigable waters in the traditional sense,
3

1

that flow into and so can affect the quality of those

2

waters.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Bishop, the government says that

4

the -- while you may be correct about the perception of

5

what the navigable waters of the United States consist of,

6

that there was no practice of referring to that conception

7

as waters of the United States.

8

MR. BISHOP:

9

QUESTION:

Do you have instances --

We do, Your Honor.
-- in the statutory text or in our

10

opinions where that precise phrase that's used in the

11

definition here, waters of the United States, is used?

12

MR. BISHOP:

Well, the traditional phrase that

13

appears over and over again in the statutes and in the

14

Court's opinions is navigable waters of the United States,

15

but there are instances where those are broken up, and in

16

effect the terms are used interchangeably.

17

In Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of

18

1899, for example, the statute begins by talking about

19

protecting the navigable capacity of the waters of the

20

United States, and immediately switches to talk about

21

preventing obstructions to the navigable waters.

22

In a much more recent statute, 1990, the Aquatic

23

Nuisance Prevention Act, which I did not cite in my brief,

24

but which I have directed the Solicitor General to, it's

25

at 16 USC 4702.

That is a statute in which the
4

1

jurisdictional term is waters of the United States.

2

What's the definition in the statute? Navigable waters.

3

The phrases have been used interchangeably in statutes and

4

in this Court's opinions, and in our reply brief in a

5

footnote towards the end we cited a number of opinions.

6

QUESTION:

Have we ever used the term waters of

7

the states or has Congress ever used the term waters of

8

the states?

9

there; I'm not sure that it necessarily follows.

10

It would seem there might be a dichotomy

MR. BISHOP:

Yes, I think in that same footnote

11

we cite a number of cases where the waters of the United

12

States is used in contradistinction to the waters of the

13

states.

14

interpretation is that there is no longer any such thing

15

as the waters of the states.

16

QUESTION:

One of the problems with the government's

I can understand.

I don't think -- I

17

can understand the position that says waters of the United

18

States means the navigable waters, but that's not your

19

position.

20

into navigable waters.

21

that says waters of the United States means whatever

22

Congress can legislate on under the commerce clause, but

23

that's not your position.

24

don't understand is the position which, I take it is

25

yours, which says that all non-navigable waters which flow

You're saying it includes anything that flows
I could understand the position

That's their position. What I

5

1

into a navigable water is within the statute, and that

2

apparently according to the amici brief, is about 80

3

percent of every backyard pond.

4

But those which flow into waters under the

5

ground rather than over the ground which I guess are

6

excluded on your theory, just because they go under the

7

ground.

8

Lake, the Great Salt Lake, huge bodies of water.

9

the big ones.

That isn't the small ones; that includes Crater
It isn't

It's some small ones, some big ones, 80

10

percent, the only difference being that they happen to

11

flow into the stream that's navigable under the ground

12

rather than over the ground.

13
14

So what conceivably could Congress have had in
mind on your interpretation?

15

MR. BISHOP:

Just one question.

16

taking a position on groundwaters.

17

conflict on that.

18

QUESTION:

We're not

The circuits are in

Maybe you're even saying that some of

19

the ones that go under the ground are within the statute,

20

but others aren't.

21

MR. BISHOP:

Some courts have held that

22

groundwaters that are connected to the -- that is, flow

23

into the navigable waters of the United States, serve as a

24

source.

25

QUESTION:

Or into the Fox River, isn't that
6

1

right?

2

MR. BISHOP:

3

QUESTION:

There is no evidence of that.
My question you see, is I can

4

understand their interpretation, I can understand a narrow

5

interpretation, but I don't understand what any human

6

being would want to accomplish by writing your

7

interpretation that would in fact exclude somewhere

8

between 5 and 20 percent of the bodies of water in

9

people's backyards.

10

MR. BISHOP:

I think what the Congress had in

11

mind in borrowing the common law and prior statutory

12

meanings of these terms was that it did want to protect

13

water, but it was also very cognizant of states' rights

14

and retained rights under the 10th Amendment to regulate,

15

and wanted to maintain limits on the scope of the

16

jurisdiction.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Bishop, is your position on this

18

issue influenced in any respect by our decision in

19

Riverside versus Bayview Homes?

20

MR. BISHOP:

Clearly I have to accommodate that

21

position, and that is one that Congress addressed

22

specifically as the Court noted in Riverside Bayview.

23

pointed out that the adjacent wetland abutted and drained

24

into the navigable waters.

25

It

I think what Congress had in mind, when you read
7

1

the legislative history, in the context of the statutory

2

language and the history of these terms is not, as the

3

government says, the commerce -- the effects of commerce

4

jurisdiction, but the channels jurisdiction.

5

interested in expanding Federal jurisdiction over the

6

water as a protective matter as far as it thought it

7

could.

8
9

QUESTION:

It was

Mr. Bishop, if that's so, then how do

you explain Section 404(g) of the statute, which allows

10

the states' governments to submit to the EPA a description

11

of a program involving discharging into waters that are

12

other than navigable or adjacent to navigable waters?

13

would Congress give the governors permission to do that if

14

those were to be excluded?

15

MR. BISHOP:

Why

It's clear that what that refers to

16

is tributaries.

The only thing excluded in the state

17

program are traditional navigable waters narrowly defined

18

as waters navigable in fact, navigable with improvement,

19

and wetlands adjacent thereto.

20

of navigable waters of the United States as set forth in

21

this Court's understanding.

22

tertiary tributaries.

23

is excluded, we believe, are the small proportion of

24

waters that are totally isolated, that do not flow into

25

the tributaries.

That leaves a vast array

XXX the finally, secondary,

As Justice Breyer pointed out, what

8

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. BISHOP:

404(g) would not cover such -It would not cover isolated waters.

3

It clearly does allow states to regulate tributaries, that

4

is, traditional navigable waters of the United States,

5

under for example, the Rivers and Harbors Act or the 1948

6

version of the Clean Water Act.

7

QUESTION:

And presumably, states can regulate,

8

under your theory, these isolated waters that don't flow

9

into navigable waters.

10

It's within the states'

jurisdiction.

11

MR. BISHOP:

That's right, Justice O'Connor, and

12

the State of Alabama in its amicus brief set out a long

13

appendix with state statutes. It's clear that virtually

14

all states, if not all states, regulate isolated waters

15

and protect them.

16

Here the State of Illinois and Cook County

17

carefully investigated our project over many public

18

hearings, over many months, and concluded the project

19

would not impact the waters involved here in any way.

20

QUESTION:

What about lakes or ponds,

21

intrastate, that don't flow into navigable waters but

22

which can support rowboats or small sailboats or something

23

like that?

24
25

MR. BISHOP:

This Court's definition in

Appalachian Electric of a navigable water included one
9

1

that could be used by small noncommercial vessels on the

2

theory that that indicated the potential of the water body

3

to be used for commerce, and we are not objecting here to

4

the Court's claim of jurisdiction over waters that are

5

navigable in fact, even by small vessels.

6

objecting solely to the taking of jurisdiction over

7

isolated water bodies that do not support commerce or

8

boating and that do not flow into and therefore affect the

9

quality of navigable waters over which the Corps has

10
11

We are

always had jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

I don't quite understand your

12

position as to why if it's a small lake entirely within

13

the boundaries of the state that you don't object to

14

Federal jurisdiction there.

15

that's not interstate commerce, it's local commerce.

16

MR. BISHOP:

Even if it's navigable,

Right, but we're not objecting -- I

17

mean, that is not our case, Justice Stevens, so I can't

18

claim to -- you know, I don't want to state a definitive

19

position on this.

20

the Corps to have regarded small lakes that support

21

intrastate commerce as part of the flow of commerce around

22

the nation.

23

QUESTION:

It's not unreasonable in our view for

Would this case be different if the

24

United States could prove that people used rowboats to go

25

fishing in the pond that we're talking about here?
10

It's

1

several acres in size, I think, isn't it?

2

MR. BISHOP:

3

shallow.

4

land.

5
6

These ponds are very tiny and

There is nothing in the record.

It's private

They have never been used.
QUESTION:

How big is the pond we're talking

about?

7

MR. BISHOP:

Well, there are a number of ponds.

8

When I was out there originally, there was no water on the

9

land.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. BISHOP:

12

I think in the record they say

several acres.

13
14

How big is the biggest one?

QUESTION:

Several acres.

and forth across that one.

15

MR. BISHOP:

16

QUESTION:

So you could row back

Two feet deep, I'm told.

They're very shallow.
If you could, would that make a

17

difference to you?

18

two feet deep, and people regularly went out in rowboats

19

in it?

20
21

Say it was ten feet deep instead of

MR. BISHOP:

The position that the Corps has

taken, which we do not object to --

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. BISHOP:

I'm asking your position.
Yes, anything that supports -- our

24

position essentially is anything that supports, could

25

support commerce, and that would include the intrastate
11

1

portion --

2

QUESTION:

I'm just asking specifically, if it

3

can support people going out in a rowboat and rowing back

4

and forth across the lake, that would be sufficient in

5

your view?

6

MR. BISHOP:

I find that implausible, but that

7

is what the Court said in --

8

QUESTION:

9
10
11

But I would like to get an answer to

my question, if you could please.

What is your view on

that hypothetical?
MR. BISHOP:

Yes, I think you have intrastate

12

waters if they are navigable, that is, if a boat can go on

13

them and move.

14

QUESTION:

This would be a different case if the

15

government could prove that rowboats could go back and

16

forth across the water?

17
18
19

MR. BISHOP:

Or if they could prove that -- yes,

that's right.
QUESTION:

Well, I don't see why you keep

20

referring to, you know, supporting interstate commerce.

21

thought the whole core of your case is that when you

22

referred to navigable waters, you're not talking about

23

interstate commerce, that there is one basis of

24

jurisdiction which is the commerce clause, and there is

25

another basis of jurisdiction which is navigable waters,
12

I

1

and if you interpret navigable waters to mean waters that

2

are navigable, whether they are navigable interstate or

3

not, it would necessarily include lakes big enough to

4

float a rowboat.

5
6

MR. BISHOP:
--

7
8

QUESTION:

MR. BISHOP: Because I believe there is a
connection.

11
12

Why do you keep referring to

interstate commerce?

9
10

That's right, Justice Scalia, but

QUESTION:

That's part of the navigable waters

clause?

13

MR. BISHOP:

No.

I believe that when Congress

14

talks about navigable waters, particularly in the expanded

15

sense that grew up over the hundred years after the Daniel

16

Ball, they had in mind the channels power, and that that's

17

how it reaches tributaries and things that affect the

18

navigable waters.

19

covered under the tributaries language of the statutes are

20

not navigable in fact and could not support even a small

21

rowboat.

22

Clearly many of the waters that are

QUESTION:

But they affect navigable waters, and

23

so Congress' authority over the navigable waters, it gives

24

the Congress the authority to protect navigable waters.

25

MR. BISHOP:

Absolutely right.
13

1

QUESTION:

So what is the source of the

2

Congress' authority over navigable waters?

3

commerce clause?

4

MR. BISHOP:

Is it the

Yes, I believe it's the channels

5

power under the commerce clause, but it is not what the

6

government has taken here which is the effects of

7

commerce.

8

the effects commerce power.

9

844(a) of the criminal code, which this Court considered

10

Congress by 1972 knew very well how to invoke
It did so, for example, in

in Lopez, where it specifically invoked that power.

11

It did not do so in the Clean Water Act. It used

12

these traditional terms, navigable waters of the United

13

States, and under any plausible understanding of those

14

terms, historical or just common sense, and certainly

15

reading the legislative history, there is absolutely no

16

indication that Congress meant to reach isolated ponds

17

that can have no affect on the quality of navigable

18

waters.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Bishop, I don't mean to belabor

20

this but I'm looking at the text of 404(g), and it seems

21

that this provision addresses permits on the application

22

of the governor of any state to things that are not

23

navigable waters, not tributaries, not adjacent wetlands.

24

They seem, this section seems to fit the category that you

25

say is outside the statute.

Perhaps you can look at the
14

1

text of 404(g) and show me where I am wrong.

2

MR. BISHOP:

No, you are right, but the statute

3

does not define the limits of what is being allotted to

4

the states.

5

the states that which is left over from the 404 permit

6

program once traditional navigable waters have been taken

7

out.

8

statute that gives the Federal government power over

9

isolated waters with no impact on the navigable waters of

The Corps -- Congress is only allotting to

It is our position that there is nothing else in the

10

the United States, and therefore the only thing that

11

404(g)(1) reaches are the tributaries which are part of

12

the navigable waters but which are not part of the

13

traditional Corps meaning of navigable waters in the

14

Daniel Ball, Appalachian Electric sense.

15

-- I mean, the statute does not say isolated waters; there

16

is nothing in there that even hints that isolated waters

17

are part of what is left over.

18

QUESTION:

19
20

That seems like

Adjacent wetlands are not left over

because that's specifically mentioned -MR. BISHOP:

Wetlands adjacent to that are

21

navigable in fact or navigable with improvements, not

22

waters that are -- wetlands that are adjacent to

23

tributaries, which are left to the states.

24

enormous amount of regulatory power to the states over

25

tributaries and their adjacent wetlands, but nothing in
15

That leaves an

1

there suggests in the least that isolated waters are

2

included in that package, and isolated waters are

3

traditionally regulated by the states anyway.

4

There are principles of statutory interpretation

5

here that even if there were any ambiguity in the

6

statutory language, which we don't believe there is, there

7

are principles of statutory interpretation which require,

8

we believe, our reading as opposed to the government's.

9

The first of those is the DeBartolo principle that a

10

statute or in this case a regulation, the bird rule should

11

not be read so as to create constitutional problems.

12

Whatever one's conclusion about the constitutionality of

13

the bird rule, it seems beyond question that it does raise

14

serious questions.

15

QUESTION:

Well, are you asking us, counsel, to

16

just focus on the bird habitat final rule or to focus on

17

the regulation in 33 Code of Federal Regulations,

18

paragraph 3328.3, defining waters of the United States?

19

MR. BISHOP:

I believe that that regulation,

20

Justice O'Connor, does not satisfy our view of the

21

statutory language and therefore should be set aside.

22

QUESTION:

23

waters of the United States?

24
25

MR. BISHOP:

Is the one 3328.3, the one defining

Right, the one defining waters of

the United States.
16

1

QUESTION:

You want us to focus on that and in

2

your view it is too broad and covers things the statute

3

didn't authorize?

4

MR. BISHOP:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. BISHOP:

That is true, it does not.
Isolated, intrastate pond?
What it does is to extend the

7

government's jurisdiction to the limits of the effects

8

commerce power.

9

Clean Water Act says.

10

Now, having said that I would like

to add, however, that the only --

11
12

We don't believe that that's what the

QUESTION:

So the bird habitat regulation

doesn't have anything to do with it, or it does?

13

MR. BISHOP:

Well, the government has -- the

14

sole basis on which the government has claimed

15

jurisdiction in this case during the past -- since 1987

16

when all this started is the bird rule.

17

mentioned another rule.

18
19

QUESTION:

They have never

In their brief --

I didn't quite understand.

The sole

basis is what, Mr. Bishop?

20

MR. BISHOP:

The sole basis is the migratory

21

bird rule.

That is what they stated when they took

22

jurisdiction in the first place.

23

jurisdiction that is stated in the 404 permit denials.

24

Having said that, we obviously don't want to go back down

25

and find ourselves caught on some other provision of the
17

It is the only basis of

1

other waters regulation. It seems to us that the other

2

waters regulation is wholly inconsistent insofar as it

3

reaches any water, any isolated water that has any

4

conceivable effect on interstate commerce.

5

That is incompatible with the plain language of

6

the statute and the legislative history, and so although

7

we -- the migratory bird rule is the only basis on which

8

jurisdiction has been asserted in their briefs to this

9

Court, the government does retreat from that and rely on

10

the activity itself, which I think is an intent to rely on

11

the other waters regulation.

12

Court to address that to save another $30 million in

13

public money which is what we spent dealing with the Corps

14

for the last 13 years.

15

And so we would like the

I was talking about the principles of statutory

16

regulation which we think support our interpretation.

One

17

is the DeBartolo principle, but a second one and one the

18

Congress had very much in mind as Section 101(b) of the

19

statute makes clear is that it was concerned not to

20

trample state powers over land use and over the

21

environment, and there is no doubt that that trampling

22

occurred here.

23

record over the course of seven years of permitting, and

24

in doing so overrode the considered determinations of the

25

State of Illinois and Cook County.

The Corps put together a 47,000-page

When it does a 404 determination, once it has

2

taken jurisdiction, it doesn't just keep its eyes on the

3

isolated waters.

standard include, for example, whether the project meets

6

the needs and welfare, the general needs and welfare of

the people.

an array of other things.

9

regulation at that point, and we believe that that is both

It roams far and wide, using a public
The elements of that public interest

It includes review of economics, aesthetics,
It is general land use

10

inconsistent to stretch the jurisdiction as the Corps has

11

through its rules, to stretch the jurisdiction to impinge

12

on state regulation in the face of a clear statement in

13

the preamble of the statute that Congress intended, had a

14

policy to preserve the primary jurisdiction of state and

15

local government over these matters, and that it is

16

inconsistent with the clear statement principle that this

17

Court has applied which requires that if Congress is going

18

to impinge on the reserved rights of the states that it

19

should say so clearly. Far from saying so clearly in this

20

case, it said that it wished to preserve to the extent

21

possible the rights of the states.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

And where are the words that say

that?
MR. BISHOP:

101(b), Your Honor, section 101(b),

1251(b), which is probably quoted on the first page of our
19

1

blue brief.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. BISHOP:

First page of the blue brief?
Yes, Your Honor.

It is the policy

4

of Congress to recognize, preserve, and protect the

5

primary responsibilities and rights of states to prevent,

6

reduce, and eliminate pollution and to plan the

7

development and use of land and water resources.

QUESTION:

Could Congress regulate these ponds

to prevent them from serving as nesting places, say for

10

mosquitos that carry West Nile disease from state to

state?

government may regulate these ponds under the interstate

QUESTION:

So instead of -- if they discovered

16

that mosquitos are flying all over the place, infect

17

birds, and people are dying in different states because of

18

a pond that is not appropriately sprayed, Congress lacks

19

the power in your view to tell the states or to tell

20

individuals to spray their ponds or not to use certain

21

pesticides that are killing people in other states.

they have that power?

birds and kills birds, and under the migratory bird treaty

What I'm trying to ask with my

question, if you can just -- suppose that it's discovered

9

that birds are causing diseases or suppose that pesticides

10

are dangerous to people.

11

cannot use a certain pesticide in your backyard pond or

your backyard tree because the effect of that is to spread

disease from state to state?

MR. BISHOP:

Can Congress tell you that you

Do they have that power?

Congress can certainly regulate

anything that is commercial, including -QUESTION:

So if the pesticide is shipped in

interstate commerce, they could regulate it on that basis?

18

MR. BISHOP:

19

QUESTION:

Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice.
Could it affect only people in

20

Indiana and not people in Illinois, so that Illinois

21

doesn't care about it?

22

If it's a national problem, are these mosquitos just going

23

to bite Indianans and not people from Illinois, so that

24

Illinois would have as much interest in preventing that as

25

the Federal government?

I mean, is this a real problem?

You would think they would have

more interest.

And if you can find a commerce

If there is no commerce connection,

problems as well, and --

commerce connection?

19

Justice's suggestion, it seems to me that the hypothetical

to substantial effects on commerce.

MR. BISHOP:

I mean apart from the Chief

Well, but I don't think that

24

that the birds, because they fly interstate and at some

25

point may get shot by or watched by people who are

crossing state lines and spending money, that is a

sufficient interstate commerce connection.

MR. BISHOP:

That wasn't the hypothetical.
That doesn't seem very different to

me from the hypothetical.

But some end user commerce

no reserve powers left to the states, everything is within

the enumerated powers.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE

19

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

20
21
22

MR. WALLACE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The Clean Water Act states its goals as to

23

restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and

24

biological integrity of the nation's waters and to attain

25

water quality which provides for the protection and
23

1

propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife.

The

2

operative provisions at issue here prohibit discharges of

3

pollutants into certain waters -- we'll get into what

4

those are in just a moment -- without a permit.

5

provisions regulate human conduct, usually commercial in

6

nature, and certainly commercial in this instance, in

7

order to avert harm to natural resources, wildlife, or the

8

environment, and in common with similar antipollution

9

provisions in other Federal environmental statutes, these

Those

10

prohibitions on conduct do not purport to assert any

11

special Federal domain over the place where the conduct

12

occurs.

13

QUESTION:

14

means, Mr. Wallace.

15

I don't understand exactly what that

MR. WALLACE:

Well, for example, in the act

16

commonly known as RCRA, another environmental statute, the

17

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, a permit

18

situation, a permit system is set up for the treatment,

19

storage or disposal of hazardous waste, which occurs in

20

privately owned land ordinarily, without any reference to

21

waters whatsoever.

22

harm to the protected species, whether that occurs on land

23

or water.

24
25

QUESTION:

The Endangered Species Act prohibits

You're saying there are a lot of laws

like this one?
24

1

MR. WALLACE:

Well, I am saying there are many

2

prohibitions on conduct that pollutes or endangers the

3

natural resources of this country or the wildlife of this

4

country that are enacted under the commerce power and that

5

are not commonly thought of or thought of in the law as

6

asserting a special Federal domain over the place where

7

the conduct occurs.

QUESTION:

10

statutes, this one is limited to the navigable waters of
the United States.

11
12

That's true, but unlike those other

MR. WALLACE:

As defined in the statute, that's

--

13

QUESTION:

As defined in the statute.

14

MR. WALLACE:

That's exactly what I'm going to

15

turn to now, but I have to speak first, as I tried to do,

16

to the argument that there would be a constitutional

17

problem if the conduct prohibited occurred in one place

18

rather than another.

19

QUESTION:

The conduct -The assertion was that if there was

20

no commerce clause connection, it would be

21

unconstitutional, and that's what the discussion was

22

about, a sufficient commerce clause connection.

23

MR. WALLACE:

24

QUESTION:

25

I guess

--

Mr. Wallace, when a justice is asking

you a question, I suggest you remain quiet until he
25

1

finishes, if that isn't too much trouble.

2

MR. WALLACE:

Thank you.

Sorry.

I'm just

3

trying to help with the inquiry.

4

event, let's turn now to the question of what waters the

5

statute addresses.

6

question, before turning to the statute, is that this

7

Court has already spoken to this issue, not in detail, but

8

quite clearly in an opinion in which it was an important

9

part of the Court's reasoning, and I'm speaking of a

I'm sorry.

In any

The first thing to be said about this

10

carefully crafted opinion of the Court in International

11

Paper Company against Ouellette which dealt with a very

12

difficult issue.

13

very difficult issue of implied preemption under the act

14

in light of the meaning of two savings clauses.

15

This is in 479 U.S., which dealt with a

And an important part of the reasoning of the

16

Court in concluding the scope of preemption of

17

escape-based causes of action, it happened to be a

18

challenge to a discharge that caused harm in an adjoining

19

state, but an important part of the Court's reasoning was

20

consideration of the comprehensive scope of the Clean

21

Water Act.

22

in describing the case first that the act applies to

23

virtually all surface water in the country, and it had a

24

footnote at that point citing its decision from the

25

previous term in Riverside Bayview Homes which had

And the Court stated at page 486 of 479 U.S.

26

1

described the Corps' regulations that extended to isolated

2

waters so-called.

3

opinion several pages later at 479 U.S. page 493, the

4

Court reasoned, As we noted in Milwaukee 2, Congress

5

intended the 1972 act amendments to establish, quote, an

6

all encompassing program of water pollution regulation,

7

unquote.

8

virtually all bodies of water, and it sets forth the

9

procedures for obtaining a permit in great detail.

10

And then in the legal discussion in its

The act applies to all point sources and

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, if you would turn to the

11

language in Riverside Bayview that you cited in passing,

12

that does say that the word navigable in this statute has

13

a, quote, limited office.

14

telling us now, which you put forward in your brief, it

15

has no office at all, that the statute would mean what you

16

say it means if the term navigable were not in there so

17

that you give no effect whatever to that term.

18

correct in so understanding?

19

MR. WALLACE:

As I understand what you're

Am I

Well, the term is defined in the

20

statute, so it has effect as a reference to the

21

definition, but it's a term of art in the statute, and

22

it's defined as waters --

23

QUESTION:

What does it have to do?

In other

24

words, would the statute do anything more or less in your

25

view if the word navigable were not there and there were
27

1

just the words waters of the United States?

2

words, does navigable have any function whatever, not has

3

it been defined away?

4

MR. WALLACE:

In other

I believe the answer is that the

5

use of the word navigable in the statute, as a reference

6

to the definition of what navigable means for purposes of

7

the statute, does not have any independent significance.

8
9

QUESTION:

May I suggest why it could have some

independent significance?

Now, Congress has many

10

authorities under the commerce clause.

It seems to me

11

clear that this statute was appealing to one aspect of

12

Congress' commerce clause powers, that aspect which has to

13

do with the control of navigable waters.

14

that and simply ignore the navigable waters appeal and

15

just say all Congress is doing is exerting its broad

16

commerce power in all its aspects simply -- just seems to

17

me to ignore a very precise appeal to one aspect of the

18

commerce clause power.

19

MR. WALLACE:

And to leap from

The word navigable appears in the

20

statute in that spot but not elsewhere.

21

not deal with navigability problems. The statute deals

22

with a water pollution crisis that was --

23

QUESTION:

The statute does

I understand, but Congress was

24

limiting its control over that problem to navigable

25

waters, and even the definition which means waters of the
28

1

United States, that can be explained without making the

2

word navigable totally useless in the statute, by simply

3

saying that was meant to make it clear that when Congress

4

said navigable waters, it meant the broad definition of

5

navigability, which had been apparent in our cases, so

6

that it includes wetlands adjacent to navigable waters and

7

includes even tributaries that go into navigable waters.

8

But it seems to me to blink reality and to say that

9

Congress was relying upon a general commerce clause power,

10

which is what the government's position is.

11

MR. WALLACE:

Well, this is the main law

12

governing conduct that pollutes surface waters in this

13

country, and it's comparable to the Safe Drinking Water

14

Act which protects aquifers and underground waters more

15

directly.

16

we explained in discussing the '72 act and then the 1977

17

amendments, the act started off and was called the Federal

18

Water Pollution Control amendments of 1972, and it used

19

the definition navigable waters, which was left over from

20

prior legislation, including the Rivers and Harbors Act,

21

but in the course of the development of the '72 act,

22

dissatisfaction was expressed with the idea that the act

23

would apply too narrowly and the definition of navigable

24

waters was changed from navigable waters of the United

25

States to just the words waters of the United States, and

But to answer your question more directly, as

29

1

the committee report reporting it out at that time said it

2

was meant to exert the full constitutional authority of

3

the Congress under the commerce power.

4

QUESTION:

What it didn't say, Mr. Wallace, is

5

what, for example, 16 USC Section 817 says, a different

6

statute.

7

quote, navigable waters of the United States and other

8

waters, quote, over which Congress has jurisdiction under

9

its authority to regulate commerce.

10

That imposes requirements on water projects on,

Now, you're essentially saying that's what this

11

statute says.

12

roundabout way.

13

it.

But if it says it, it says it in such a
I mean, this is a very easy way to say

14

MR. WALLACE:

15

QUESTION:

Well, it --

Water projects are navigable waters

16

of the United States and other waters over which Congress

17

has jurisdiction under its authority to regulate commerce.

18

MR. WALLACE:

It can be said quite plainly, I

19

mean, Congress could have spoken with greater clarity than

20

it did.

21

QUESTION:

Well, isn't that a problem under any

22

clear statement analysis?

I understand, I think I

23

understand your argument, and I can see that it is

24

possible to construe the language as broadly as you do,

25

but when literally any farm pond in the United States is
30

1

going to be subject to Corps jurisdiction on your analysis

2

and Congress has not spoken any more clearly than it has

3

here, isn't that a reason for construing the statute more

4

narrowly rather than as broadly as you are here?

5

MR. WALLACE:

6

the Court in Riverside Bayview --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. WALLACE:

9
10
11

It arguably is a reason, although

A good reason.
-- said the deference to the

Corps' interpretation was appropriate, because Congress
had not directly spoken to the issue.
QUESTION:

We do here seem to have -- and maybe

12

we did there for that matter, but we seem at least to have

13

a conflict in principle because we have the deference

14

principle and then we have some clear statement notion

15

when the results get to the, sort of to the bizarre point.

16

So which principle do we choose?

17

MR. WALLACE:

Well, I have to take issue with

18

whether the result here gets to a bizarre point that

19

implicates a clear statement rule, but I do think that

20

we're talking precisely on the issue on which Congress

21

focused in the 1977 amendments to the act.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, it's at least unclear

23

enough that the Corps of Engineers didn't come to this

24

interpretation until quite late on. They didn't interpret

25

it this way originally themselves, did they?
31

That's how

1

at least unclear it is, not to say clear in the other

2

direction.

3

MR. WALLACE:

They did not interpret it this way

4

originally but were reprimanded by several court decisions

5

for misinterpreting the act.

6

authority to interpret the act, did interpret it this way

7

originally, and the Corps came around after conducting

8

another rulemaking proceeding as it was ordered to do by a

9

court that had said its view of the authority was too

EPA, which has the primary

10

narrow to accomplish the purposes of the act that Congress

11

had in mind, and the two agencies reached the same

12

conclusion by the time Congress was considering the 1977

13

amendments which focused very specifically on the question

14

of whether the jurisdiction over so-called isolated waters

15

had gone too far.

16

The House of Representatives --

17

QUESTION:

18

Mr. Wallace, had the EPA taken this

position before 1977?

19

MR. WALLACE:

20

QUESTION:

21
22

Yes.

And so that position was in a

regulation at the time Congress acted in 1977?
MR. WALLACE:

That is correct.

And it was also

23

in the interim rule that the Corps had come to, and indeed

24

the Corps adopted its final rule during the course of

25

consideration after the House had passed its bill but
32

1

before the Senate had voted.

2

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, this comes to us as a

3

sort of as-applied challenge, I guess, and in the context

4

of provisions imposing criminal penalties.

5

influence our interpretation at all?

6

lenity concerns or anything of the sort because we are

7

dealing with statutes imposing criminal penalty?

8
9

MR. WALLACE:

Does that

Is there any rule of

Well, that was an issue that the

Court addressed in its opinion in Babbitt versus Sweet

10

Home in footnote 18 of that opinion, where in a civil

11

proceeding a similar concern was raised.

12

answer given in that footnote that in a civil context of

13

litigation where the agency interpretation has been made

14

clear, that there's no occasion to invoke the rule of

15

lenity.

16

QUESTION:

And I think the

So the statute can mean one thing if

17

it's prosecuted criminally, and something different if

18

it's prosecuted civilly?

19

MR. WALLACE:

20

QUESTION:

That's extraordinary.
We don't take that position.

But that's what the footnote you

21

appeal to would seem to suggest.

22

MR. WALLACE:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. WALLACE:

25

It's a footnote by this Court.

Well, even so.
We do have mens rea questions that

we and the courts have been struggling with.
33

1

QUESTION:

The point of the footnote, as I

2

remember it was, if the matter is cleared up in the civil

3

proceedings, then the rule of lenity doesn't apply

4

subsequently because there is no longer the ambiguity that

5

gives rise to the rule of lenity problem.

6

MR. WALLACE:

7

QUESTION:

Very well stated.

Which raises the different problem of

8

what the statute means depends upon whether the first case

9

prosecuted is a criminal or a civil case, is that the

10

government's position?

11

MR. WALLACE:

Well, we're very cautious about

12

not bringing what we think would be an unfair criminal

13

prosecution.

14

those initiatives to scofflaw situations where we think

15

that we could prevail and where that kind of sanction is

16

appropriate.

17

We're mostly -- we mostly try to confine

But to get back to the 1977 controversy, the

18

House did pass a bill, and a similar bill was sponsored by

19

Senator Bentsen in the Senate, but both bills made clear

20

that they were not repudiating the broader scope of

21

authority for EPA in regulating toxic discharges into all

22

waters of the United States as they had been interpreted

23

in the regulations, but only addressed the Corps'

24

permitting activities with respect to dredge and fill

25

activities.
34

1

The Congress indicated in detail that it was

2

very familiar with the agency interpretations by both

3

agencies, and even then the Senate refused to pass the

4

House version or the Bentsen amendment, and it decided

5

instead to retain the existing scope of the geographic

6

authority stated in the regulations that had been adopted,

7

but to counterbalance that with this new provision that

8

Justice Ginsburg has been averting to, 404(g), which

9

provided authority for the states to adopt their own

10

programs over what were called in the Corps' new

11

regulation and the Senate report, very specifically

12

referred to this as Phase II and Phase III of the

13

expansion of the Corps' permit program, and we have quoted

14

the Senate report that uses precisely those terms on page

15

25 of our brief.

16

The committee amendment does not redefine

17

navigable waters.

Instead, the committee amendment

18

intends to assure continued protection of all the nation's

19

waters but allows states to assume the primary

20

responsibility for protecting the waters outside of the

21

so-called Phase I waters, which are the navigable waters

22

and those adjacent and then the wetlands adjacent thereto.

23

Under the committee amendment the Corps will continue to

24

administer the entire Section 404 program in all navigable

25

waters until the approval of a state program for Phase II
35

1

and Phase III waters, and the Phase III waters which the

2

Corps was planning to get to in a couple of years time are

3

the waters at issue here.

4

So the whole premise of the Senate bill, which

5

is what the conference committee adopted, was that the

6

extension of jurisdiction to these Phase III waters would

7

be retained, but the states would be given the option of

8

administering the program.

9

that, New Jersey and Michigan.

Two states have chosen to do
New Jersey was one of

10

eight states that have filed a brief in our support in

11

this case.

12

I hasten to point out.

13

counterbalanced the retention of the broad jurisdiction by

14

providing for certain exemptions, including an exemption

15

of certain agricultural activities because of precisely

16

the concern that Justice Souter suggested might raise a

17

question of bizarre authority and also have --

Only one has filed a brief on the other side,

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. WALLACE:

And the Senate also

That is in the statute, Mr. Wallace?
That is in the statute. That was

20

part of the 1977 amendments that certain exemptions were

21

added.

22
23

QUESTION:

Could you give us -- is it in your

brief somewhere?

24

MR. WALLACE:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes, it is.

Could you tell us where?
36

1

MR. WALLACE:

It's Section 1344(f) of Title 33.

2

QUESTION:

Thank you.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, how -- I'm trying to get

4

a quantitative idea from what one of the amici briefs

5

suggested.

6

interstate commerce, maybe the word is substantially

7

affects or significantly affects, whatever the

8

constitutional test, but think of that set of water, all

9

the water that significantly affects interstate commerce

Your view is that all the water that affects

10

is included.

11

that affects interstate commerce is included provided it

12

also is either navigable or if not navigable, it flows

13

into navigable water, and I thought they were talking

14

about flows on the surface.

15

I take it that they agree that all the water

There is an amicus brief that says well, there

16

is only about 20 percent left over.

Is that right?

Now,

17

I think maybe today -- I'm not sure.

18

said it also includes the water affecting interstate

19

commerce that isn't navigable but flows underground, in

20

which case I would think that takes care of everything

21

else.

22

doesn't flow underground, and I take think it this

23

particular place, the Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA

24

think it does flow into the Fox River underground, and

25

they think it doesn't flow into the Fox River underground,

I think maybe they

Maybe there is a tiny little bit that actually

37

1

so I'm not sure what we're supposed to do.

2

get an idea of what the -- what we're talking about.

3

MR. WALLACE:

I'm trying to

Well, one of the rules specified

4

by the Corps in its elaboration of its regulations as to

5

what waters can affect interstate commerce are those that

6

are used as habitat by migratory birds protected under

7

bird treaty acts or that migrate between the states, which

8

happened to be the basis on which jurisdiction was

9

asserted here, on the basis of the factual showing that

10

was made to the Corps by an Illinois state agency dealing

11

with birds.

12

And perhaps if we get away from this particular

13

cite for a moment, much of the battle would be about the

14

so-called prairie potholes in the Dakotas and adjoining

15

states where about 50 percent of the waterfowl in this

16

country breed.

17

understand it, the commerce power would enable Congress to

18

protect the winter habitat of duck species and other

19

waterfowl in the Chesapeake Bay area with all of its tidal

20

waters and navigable rivers and et cetera, but not to

21

protect the summer breeding habitat of these same

22

waterfowl.

23

Under petitioner's position, as I

QUESTION:

I don't think that's his position.

24

think his position is not that the commerce power doesn't

25

allow you to protect them. It's that the navigable waters

I

1

aspect of the commerce power doesn't allow you to protect

2

them, and if Congress wants to come back and exert its

3

commerce power generally, it would be a different issue.

4

MR. WALLACE:

That is a statutory argument, but

5

he also is making the argument that that interpretation is

6

one that should be adopted because otherwise there would

7

be constitutional doubt about the authority of Congress to

8

protect this bird habitat, and of course any scientist

9

would look at this question and say, well, it's futile,

10

it's ineffectual to be able to protect the habitat that

11

they use in one season but not to be able to protect the

12

habitat that they use in another season, the breeding

13

season.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, just to be clear on one

15

thing, it is the Corps' position, is it not, that the

16

Phase III water, their power to regulate the Phase III

17

water applies whether or not the isolated ponds have an

18

underground connection to navigable waters?

19

MR. WALLACE:

That is correct, and the so-called

20

prairie potholes are perhaps the prime example of that.

21

The waters here, that's a more difficult inquiry.

22

Certainly they serve as storage for what would otherwise

23

be flood waters during periods of heavy rain that would

24

cause overflow. That was part of what the Corps had to

25

deal with in dealing with this application.
39

QUESTION:

Do the states exercise any regulation

over the prairie potholes?
MR. WALLACE:

They do.

This whole area is one

4

of concurrent and overlapping authority between the states

5

and the Federal government, as the states that have filed

6

amicus in our support have pointed out.

7

QUESTION:

Maybe the Federal government was

8

content to protect the navigable waters from pollution and

9

to leave the problem of the pollution of waters that don't

10

affect the navigable waters to the states.

11

perfectly rational approach.

12

MR. WALLACE:

It's a

Well, that is exactly contrary to

13

what the Senate committee said in adopting the 1977

14

amendments.

15

QUESTION:

But I mean, this case, it seems to

16

me, does point up the problem that petitioner's counsel

17

raised quoting from page 1 of the blue brief, it is the

18

primary responsibility of the states to eliminate

19

pollution and to plan development and use of land.

20

you have a 47,000-page report, did I hear that correctly,

21

that the Corps of Engineers issued?

MR. WALLACE:

This was a very --

It seems to me that this illustrates

24

that the way in which the Corps has promulgated its

25

regulation departs from the design of the statute.
40

1

MR. WALLACE:

Well, the Corps grants all but

2

less than one percent of applications each year, and about

3

85 percent of the permits that it issues are issued under

4

general permit programs which are streamlined and do not

5

require individual inquiries into the categories that they

6

fall, if certain conditions are met in the application.

7

9

QUESTION:

I don't see how that should affect

our determination.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, what we had in this case was

10

what turned out to be a very complex inquiry, although

11

petitioner characterizes that it's trenching on local land

12

use planning functions, but local land use boards seldom

13

have to deal with a project of this magnitude, and its

14

potential and long-range effects on the people who will be

15

affected by it in their posterity, which is why the states

16

supporting us say that the special expertise of the Corps

17

and of the other agencies, state and Federal, that weighed

18

in in this process, and of course responses were received

19

from petitioner and its supporters, were so important,

20

because what was implicated here was not only dangers to

21

migratory birds but a question of possible contamination

22

of an aquifer used by thousands of people for their

23

drinking water.

QUESTION:

Has Illinois showed no interest at

all or concern about this particular site?
41

Is this a

situation where the state has just turned its back and

said, we don't care?

3

MR. WALLACE:

The state agencies participated in

4

the Corps proceeding.

5

licensed a plan to which many mitigation measures were

6

added by the state so that the plan would have been a much

7

better one if the Corps had approved it than what

petitioner started with.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY S. BISHOP

22

24

connected on the surface or through groundwater to the

25

navigable waters, but the fact is any change made in the

of water.

3

it drains onto an impermeable surface where the water

4

evaporates rather than onto the garden where it goes down

5

into our water table and ends up in Lake Michigan.

6

The Corps cannot use this language which

I just switched the gutter on my garage so that

7

requires some physical connection to the navigable waters

8

to extend its jurisdiction in the same way that it's now

9

extending it endlessly through the effects commerce strand

10

of the commerce power, so -- and as to groundwater, I did

11

not and certainly do not mean to suggest that the Corps

12

can regulate any water that flows into groundwater.

13

law is clear in the 7th Circuit that the Corps does not

14

have jurisdiction over groundwater.

15

Circuit, for example, has held that if the groundwater

16

recharges surface water, there's jurisdiction.

17

simply an issue that is not in this case, and I do not

18

concede that if there is any connection to the groundwater

19

here that that would be jurisdictional. And the record in

20

this case which is 47,000 pages long contains no basis of

21

jurisdiction, no sourcible authority at all other than

22

presence of migratory birds on these waters.

23

The

Other courts, the 5th

That's

The parade of horrors that Mr. Wallace has

24

trotted out should also not be believed.

25

43

The Clean Water

birds.

The Migratory Bird Treaty Act which is authorized

2

under the treaty power gives Congress the authority to

3

protect birds and their habitats. The spending power has

4

been used to great effect in the prairie potholes region

5

whereas this Court considered in the South Dakota case,

6

the Federal government has either acquired outright or

7

bought easements over more than a million acres, and this

8

is 20 years ago, more than a million acres of prairie

9

potholes.

So taking out this strand, the bird rule and

10

the other waters rule, this strand from the Corps'

11

jurisdiction will have and should have no impact on what

12

Congress can do under the other statutes.

13

If you address this case as a statutory rather

14

than a constitutional case, it would also want to address

15

the question whether Congress can come back with a

16

different plan to protect clean waters. What we don't

17

believe the government can plausibly assert is that the

18

terms navigable waters defined as waters of the United

19

States, given the history, given the legislative history,

20

given the historical usage of those terms, in this Court

21

and other statutes, extends to isolated ponds regulated by

22

the states.
