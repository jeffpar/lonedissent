ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8
9

MR. OLSON:

And may it please the Court: Two

weeks after the November 7 presidential election, the

10

Florida Supreme Court overturned and materially rewrote

11

portions of the carefully formulated set of laws enacted

12

by Florida's legislature to govern the conduct of that

13

election and the determination of controversies with

14

respect to who prevailed on November 7th.

15

been formulated by the Florida legislature pursuant to an

16

express delegation of authority, to wit, by the United

17

States Constitution.

18

legislature developed conformed to Title 3, Section 5 of

19

the United States Code.

20

devise rules in advance of an election, to govern the

21

counting of votes and the settling of election

22

controversy.

23

QUESTION:

These laws have

The election code that the Florida

That provision invites states to

Well, Mr. Olson, isn't Section 5 sort

24

of a safe harbor provision for states, and do you think

25

that it gives some independent right of a candidate to
3

1

overturn a Florida decision based on that section?

2

MR. OLSON:

We do,

Justice O'Connor.

It is a

3

safe harbor, but it's more than that.

4

Title 3 needs to be construed in connection with the

5

history that brought it forth --

6

QUESTION:

Yes.

And Section 5 of

But I would have thought it was

7

a section designed in the case of, some election contest

8

ends up before the Congress, a factor that the Congress

9

can look at in resolving such a dispute.

I just don't

10

quite understand how it would be independently

11

enforceable.

12

MR. OLSON:

That's why I've mentioned the

13

context in which that section was adopted.

14

the extreme controversy that was faced by this country as

15

a result of the 1876 election, and as this Court knows,

16

that election was very close and led to controversy,

17

contest, discord, Congress was very much concerned about

18

the possibility of that happening again, and one of the

19

reasons --

20

QUESTION:

In light of

Yeah, but what they did was, and it's

21

typical of grant-in-aid programs, they said if you run a

22

clean shop down there, we'll give you a bonus, and if you

23

don't, well, you take your chances with everybody else.

24
25

MR. OLSON:

Justice Kennedy, I submit that it is

much like a compact that Congress is offering in the form
4

1

of Section 5, yes.

2

will happen.

3

to accomplish with Section 5 was not only to provide the

4

benefit to the states, but to provide the benefit to the

5

United States of the states accepting that implicit

6

proposal.

7

If you do these things, certain things

But among these things, what Congress wanted

QUESTION:

But what is there in the opinion of

8

the Supreme Court of Florida that indicates that it relied

9

on this Federal statute in the reasoning for its decision

10

and in its judgment?

11

MR. OLSON:

Well, I think the fact is that it

12

did not.

13

When the state adopted a code of ethics, or a code of

14

election procedures to govern the election and the

15

determination of disputes pursuant to the election, it

16

brought itself into that safe harbor and guaranteed to the

17

voters and the candidates in that state that the

18

controversy and turmoil that infected this country after

19

the 1876 --

20

What it did was it disregarded the compact.

QUESTION:

Well, we are looking for a Federal

21

issue, and I thought that you might have argued that the

22

Secretary of State was instructed by the Supreme Court not

23

to jeopardize the state's chances and then cited 3 U.S.C.

24

Sections 1 through 10.

25

supreme court relied on a Federal issue or a Federal

And so if the, if the state

5

1

background principle and got it wrong, then you can be

2

here.

3

MR. OLSON:

Well, I certainly agree that it

4

mentioned those provisions.

I'm simply saying that it

5

blew past the important provisions of Section 5 and the

6

benefits that Section 5 gives to the states to the voters

7

in that state and to the people running for office in that

8

state.

9

with, if disputes are resolved according to the rules that

That is to say that if the rules are complied

10

are set forth, then not only will the electors chosen by

11

the voters in that state be given conclusive effect at the

12

time they are counted by Congress but we will not have the

13

controversy, dispute and chaos that's been taking place in

14

Florida.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Olson, suppose a less, a less

16

controversial Federal benefit scheme, let's say the scheme

17

that says states can get highway funds if, if they hold

18

their highway speeds to a certain level, all right?

19

suppose you have a state supreme court that in your view

20

unreasonably interprets a state statute as not holding

21

highway speed to the level required in order to get the

22

benefit of that safe harbor.

23

raises a Federal question and that you could appeal the

24

state court decision here because it deprived the state of

25

the benefit of the highway funds?

And

Would you think that that

6

1

MR. OLSON:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. OLSON:

No, I don't think so.
Why is this any different?
This is a great deal different

4

because this is -- first of all, Article II of the

5

Constitution which vests authority to establish the rules

6

exclusively in the legislatures of the state, tie in with

7

Section 5.

8
9

Secondly, as this Court has stated -QUESTION:

5.

Well, let's just talk about Section

I mean, the constitutional question's another one.

10

Why is Section 5 in that regard any different from the

11

highway funding?

12

MR. OLSON:

I think it -- I think it can't be

13

divorced from Article II of the Constitution because it's

14

a part of a plan for the vesting in the legislatures of a

15

state, and Section 5 implements Article II in the sense

16

that it provides a benefit not just to the state but to

17

the voters.

18

QUESTION:

But just talk about the statutory

19

issue.

20

Justice Scalia's hypothetical, we could find a case where

21

a court adjudicated with reference to the Federal

22

principle and got the Federal principle wrong.

23

Indiana vs. Brand and that kind of thing.

24

here?

25

I assume that if we worked long enough with

MR. OLSON:

Did --

Did that happen

Well, I think that the state did not
7

1

pay, the state supreme court did not pay much attention to

2

the Federal statute.

3

did get the Federal principle --

4
5

QUESTION:

It was obviously aware of it.

Well, then there is no Federal

constitutional issue here.

6

MR. OLSON:

Well, there is a Federal--

7

QUESTION:

Pardon me, statutory issue.

8

MR. OLSON:

9

It

Well, we believe that there is,

Justice Kennedy, because although the state recognized it,

10

it blew right past it.

11

code that the Section 5 of Article 3 of Title 3 invited it

12

to do.

13

the Constitution, but I can't divorce the constitutional

14

provision from Section 5, then overturned the plan that

15

the state enacted through its legislature to make sure

16

that what happened down in Florida was not going to

17

happen.

18

full well that these provisions existed, overturned the

19

carefully enacted plan by Florida.

20

The state legislature adopted the

The state supreme court, which had no right under

And so what the state supreme court did, knowing

QUESTION:

Mr. Olson, do you think that Congress

21

when it passed 3 U.S. Code, intended that there would be

22

any judicial involvement?

23

just as easily be read as a direction to Congress, saying

24

what we are going to do when these electoral votes are

25

presented to us for counting.

I mean, it seems to me it can

8

1

MR. OLSON:

I think that it was intend --

2

directed to Congress, but it seems to me that in the

3

context in which it was adopted and the promise that it

4

afforded, that the conclusive effect would be given to the

5

state selection of electors, that is a somewhat empty

6

remedy and it doesn't accomplish Congress' objectives if

7

it cannot be enforced when an agency of the state

8

government steps in as the Florida Supreme Court did here

9

and overturn the plan by which the Florida legislature

10

carefully set forth a program so that disputes could be

11

resolved, and we wouldn't have the controversy, conflict

12

and chaos that we submit exists today in Florida.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Olson, your -- your submission is

14

based on the premise that the Florida court overturned

15

something that the statute did not. Is it not arguable, at

16

least, that all they did was fill gaps that had not been

17

addressed before?

18

MR. OLSON:

Justice Stevens, I don't think that

19

in this case that's even remotely arguable. What the state

20

supreme court did is take a set of timetables, a set of

21

provisions that --

22

QUESTION:

Yes.

And the first one was the

23

mandatory -- is it your view still that the shall date

24

controls in all respects?

25

MR. OLSON:

No.

Not necessarily.
9

But the 102

1

-- there is the two provisions, Section 102.111 and

2

102.112.

3

may date.

111 contains the shall date, 102 contains the

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. OLSON:

Correct.
Both of those statutes, both of

6

those provisions say that the returns must be, or shall be

7

filed by a certain deadline.

8

provisions simply relate to the possible remedy.

9

submit that under either interpretation the Secretary of

The shall and the may

10

State of Florida either must or shall ignore those

11

returns, or may set those aside in her discretion.

We

12

QUESTION:

Does that mean if there were an act

13

of God that prevented the returns from being filed that

14

she would have discretion either to accept or reject the

15

returns?

16

MR. OLSON:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. OLSON:

19

QUESTION:

20
21
22
23

Yes, I believe -She would have the discretion?
Yes.
Would she be compelled in that event

to accept the returns?
MR. OLSON:

I don't think so.

She took the

position -QUESTION:

24

to accept or reject?

25

MR. OLSON:

She has the total discretion either

That's -10

QUESTION:

Is there any circumstance in which

she would be compelled to accept a late return?
MR. OLSON:

I don't know of any.

thought of any, Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

Well, you are arguing in effect that

6

it's a mandatory deadline.

7

it's mandatory.

8
9
10
11
12
13

I haven't

MR. OLSON:

I wonder if you really mean

Well, the problem is that it's --

what we are saying is that either it's mandatory, in which
case she could not accept them.
QUESTION:

But you don't know whether it's

mandatory or not?
MR. OLSON:

Well, the Florida Supreme Court and

14

what the circuit court did in that case, it said that it

15

wasn't -- and we'll accept this for purposes of this

16

argument that it wasn't --

17

QUESTION:

Yes, but one of the things that's of

18

interest to me is the extent to which you say there was a

19

change in the law.

20

that question you have to know what your view of the law

21

was before this all happened.

22

MR. OLSON:

It seems to me that in order to answer

I think that we can answer that this

23

way, is that whether it was shall ignore or may ignore.

24

It was not must accept.

25

QUESTION:

Under any circumstance it was not
11

1

3

must?
MR. OLSON:
must accept.

No, under no circumstances was it

Now --

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. OLSON:

6

QUESTION:

Okay.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. --

8

QUESTION:

Isn't the law in Florida like as in

9

Even in an act of God or fraud?
I don't believe so, Justice Stevens.

most states, and in the Federal government, that when an

10

official has discretion, may accept or may not accept,

11

that has to be exercised within the limits of reason?

12

MR. OLSON:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.
Well, then, isn't it possible that

14

when the court says she must accept under certain

15

circumstances, what they mean is outside those

16

circumstances, given the circumstances here it would be

17

unreasonable to refuse?

18

MR. OLSON:

Well, what the court did was so

19

constrain those circumstances, virtually to make them

20

nonexistent.

21

QUESTION:

All right.

So then what you're

22

arguing about is a determination by the state court of

23

Florida as to what the circumstances are under state law

24

where the action of a state official would or would not be

25

reasonable.
12

1

MR. OLSON:

I think that -- yes, but I think

2

that it has to be looked at in the context in which that

3

was done when the state supreme court so constrained and

4

says in its opinion shall accept these late returns until

5

5 p.m. on November 26th, and in the context there was no

6

discretion left for the Secretary of State at all.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Olson, may I ask you, because

8

you've been skipping over what I thought was a key piece

9

of the Florida legislation.

The Florida Supreme Court

10

said, there's the deadline, and that conflicts with

11

another provision of this law, the provision that says

12

there shall be under certain circumstances recounts, and

13

then there's a rather detailed description of the process

14

that's necessary, the time line for when you can ask the

15

recount is on the 6th day.

16

MR. OLSON:

17

QUESTION:

Up to.
Yeah, up to.

And it would be

18

impossible in a populous county to in one day do what the

19

statute instructs must be done when there's a recount.

20

The Florida Supreme Court said, it's right in its opinion,

21

there's two conflicts, and the first one they mention

22

straight out on page 21A of your appendix, is that there

23

has to be a reconciliation between this, yes, there can be

24

recounts and, yes, there's a deadline.

25

to reconcile two provisions.
13

So they are trying

1

MR. OLSON:

The first part of the recount

2

provision to which you're referring, Justice Ginsburg,

3

says may conduct a recount.

4

after the sampling part of that process is taken, if it's

5

taken in the county canvassing board's discretion, then

6

under certain circumstances it's supposed to go forward

7

with a more fulsome process, but the legislature being

8

fully aware of the recount provisions and the importance

9

of -- this ties in with the protest period for the

Under certain circumstances

10

election, which overlaps the recount provisions, and the

11

contest provision for the election, and the fact that all

12

of this has to be done in the context of a presidential

13

election.

14

Under any other kind of election, these things

15

wouldn't be nearly as important, but we have very

16

important timetables, and as this Court has said a

17

presidential election is so important to the rest of the

18

nation, and there is such high Federal interest in

19

accomplishing these things in the right way, what the

20

Florida legislature did is balance the protest period, the

21

recount period with the contest period, and state that

22

there shall be certain deadlines before which certain

23

things need to be done and after which, so what those two

24

statutes say is that there may be a recount, but that

25

there shall be compliance with the time deadline.
14

It also

1

says that --

2

QUESTION:

But that's something that one can

3

certainly argue.

4

the Florida Supreme Court said, and I do not know of any

5

case where we have impugned a state supreme court the way

6

you are doing in this case.

7

have said we owe the highest respect to what the state

8

says, state supreme court says, is the state's law.

9

My problem is, one could also argue what

MR. OLSON:

I mean, in case after case we

This is a very unusual situation,

10

Justice Ginsburg, because it is in the context of a

11

presidential election, and it is in the context of Federal

12

rights.

13

described in our brief, undertaken to review the meaning

14

and the effect that the state supreme court or state court

15

decision under certain circumstances.

16

one.

17

This Court has, in the areas in which we've

We submit this is

What the Florida Supreme -QUESTION:

But I said, and even in the very

18

cases that you cite, because I checked them, that we owe

19

the highest respect to the state court when it says what

20

the state law is.

21

MR. OLSON:

Yes, but then the Court has also

22

said, then we go on to see the extent to which what the

23

state court did, as we cited in the Lindsey case, for

24

example, in the ex post facto context, we go on to see

25

what the import of that is in connection with the Federal
15

1

right.

2

Court did is basically essentially say, we're rewriting

3

the statute, we're changing it.

4

I would emphasize that what the Florida Supreme

QUESTION:

Does the Secretary have any

5

flexibility to accommodate the statute to the exigencies

6

was presidential election?

7

MR. OLSON:

The Secretary of State.

The Secretary of State did. It

8

doesn't -- she doesn't much anymore because what has

9

happened -- and I would like to finish that one point,

10

that the Florida Supreme Court said we are not going to be

11

bound by technical statutory requirements or what the

12

supreme court called hyper-technical statutory

13

requirements.

14

of the people, the will of the electorate, the will of the

15

voters, so to speak, and we are going to -- because we

16

can't rewrite the statute, but we are going to partially

17

rewrite the statute, we are going to resort to our

18

equitable powers.

19

the court did, and there are a range of them, as I have

20

indicated, they took away the discretion of the Secretary

21

and instructed her to accept these manual recount returns.

22

Instead, we are going to resort to the will

QUESTION:

So what -- and among the things that

Mr. Olson, on the equitable powers,

23

they were doing that in setting a new deadline, and I

24

don't think you would argue the case would have been more

25

acceptable if there had been no deadline?
16

1

MR. OLSON:

2

QUESTION:

No, it wouldn't have been, but -And on the fight between may and

3

shall, they relied on four traditional canons of statutory

4

construction and not equity at all.

5

MR. OLSON:

They recited four canons of

6

statutory construction, Justice Stevens, but when they

7

said they use those construction -- canons of statutory

8

construction to say that the words may and shall mean

9

shall not, that is not a reasonable exercise of statutory

10

construction.

11

that what the supreme court did is exactly what Article --

12

Section 5 of Article III intends not to happen.

13

the rules.

14

I think what the -- it's relatively obvious

QUESTION:

Change

I don't read their opinion that way,

15

Mr. Olson.

16

opinion dealing with statutory construction ends with a

17

conclusion that the Secretary has discretion.

18

of the opinion employing the canons of construction does

19

not place any limits upon the Secretary's discretion.

20

It seems to me that the portion of their

MR. OLSON:

The portion

Well, yes, I agree with that up to a

21

point, but then it says that she must accept these returns

22

that are after the deadline.

23

QUESTION:

That was not on the basis of any

24

canons of statutory construction.

25

of the state's constitution.
17

That was on the basis

1

MR. OLSON:

That's right, but -- so there was

2

both going on, and what the court was bound and determined

3

to do was to get to a consequence that the court

4

determined was consistent with the will of the people,

5

irrespective of what the statute --

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Olson, would you agree that when

7

we read a state court decision, we should read it in the

8

light most favorable to the integrity of the state supreme

9

court, that if there are two possible readings, one that

10

would impute to that court injudicial behavior, lack of

11

integrity, indeed dishonesty, and the other one that would

12

read the opinion to say we think this court is attempting

13

to construe the state law -- it may have been wrong, we

14

might have interpreted it differently, but we are not the

15

arbiters, they are.

16

MR. OLSON:

I would like to answer that in two

17

ways.

18

hope my words didn't, that there was a lack of integrity

19

or any dishonesty by the Florida Supreme Court.

20

we're saying, that it was acting far outside the scope of

21

its authority in connection with an exercise of power that

22

is vested by the Constitution of the United States --

23

In the first place, I don't mean to suggest, and I

QUESTION:

What

But if it tells us -- if it tells us,

24

we see these two provisions in conflict, they need to be

25

reconciled.
18

1

MR. OLSON:

But -- under almost any other

2

circumstances, yes, Justice Ginsburg, but in this context,

3

in this context, we are talking about a Federal right, a

4

Federal constitutional right, and the rights of individual

5

citizens under the Constitution and so therefore, this

6

Court has a grave responsibility to look --

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Olson, I'd like to get focused a

8

little more on this same area.

9

of state law, I suppose we normally would leave it alone

If it were purely a matter

10

where the state supreme court found it, and so you

11

probably have to persuade us there is some issue of

12

Federal law here.

Otherwise, why are we acting?

13

MR. OLSON:

14

QUESTION:

Yes.
And are you relying in that regard on

15

Title 2?

16

you like to characterize the Federal issue that you think

17

governs this?

18

I mean, would you like to -- Article II?

MR. OLSON:

Would

Well, we are very definitely relying

19

on Article II of the Constitution.

The framers of the

20

Constitution debated long and hard. It was one of the

21

longest debates that took place during the formation of

22

the Constitution.

23

the Federal legislature, in the state legislature, at the

24

ballot booth or what.

25

and rejected by virtually everyone is that the power to

Where should this power be lodged, in

The one thing that was discussed

19

1

select the manner in which electors would be appointed

2

would be in the state judiciary, and we quote -- in the

3

state judiciary.

4

That was rejected.

The notion that it would be vested in the state

5

judiciary was something that was rejected, and what the

6

framers decided to do is to vest it in the state

7

legislature and vested that authority under Article II,

8

not just in the state, but the legislature.

9

QUESTION:

And the state legislature could vest

10

it in the judiciary if it wanted, as I read the McPherson

11

case, and here they have done something less.

12

judiciary said, we are going to invoke the ordinary

13

election procedures, which you know, warts and all, it

14

involves some interpretation by the courts and contest

15

proceedings, et cetera.

16

MR. OLSON:

The state

Well, it is -- yes, it said that,

17

Justice Kennedy.

18

rules elect -- enacted before the election to govern the

19

election, for a set of rules made up after the election.

20

But what it did was supplant a set of

QUESTION:

All right.

Mr. Olson, let's assume

21

that it did that, for the sake of argument.

22

back to the issue that the Chief Justice raised a little

23

while ago, and I'd like you to comment on this line of

24

reasoning.

25

seems to have gone to great lengths to provide what to do

You've got Section 5.

20

I want to go

Congress in the statute

1

in the situation that you are describing, accepting your

2

view of the case.

3

Section 5, it says if you do certain things

4

within certain times, the conclusion that you draw is

5

going to be conclusive upon the Congress.

6

it sets out in fact an elaborate set of contingencies

7

about what the Congress is supposed to do and can do if

8

there is a dispute as to whether a given set of procedures

9

in the state have conformed to Section 5.

In Section 15,

Section 15

10

refers to regularity.

11

illegality.

12

stage of the proceedings, Congress has said if there is a

13

question about whether this if-then provision in Section

14

5, construing Article II, has been satisfied, then this is

15

the decisional tree for the Congress to follow in deciding

16

what to do about it and in resolving challenges.

17

It refers to legality and

It looks to me as though at least at this

It looks to me as though at this stage of the

18

game, the statute has committed the determination of the

19

issues that you raise and the consequences to follow from

20

them to the Congress.

21

the Federal judiciary be interfering in what seems to be a

22

very carefully thought out scheme for determining what

23

happens if you are right?

24
25

MR. OLSON:

Why should the Court, why should

Because I submit that that writes

Section 5 essentially out of existence if an agency of
21

1

state government, if a state legislature --

2

QUESTION:

No.

It doesn't write it out of

3

existence.

4

state agency does what you say it did.

5

It provides in Section 15 what happens if the

MR. OLSON:

If the state agency, if the state

6

legislature empowered by Article II of the Constitution,

7

does what it is invited to do by Section 5, and then

8

another agency of state government, in this case the state

9

supreme court, comes along and upsets that scheme, yes,

10

you have ultimate resort to the resolution of the dispute

11

under Sections 15 of Title 3, but that's precisely --

12

QUESTION:

Well, you say you have ultimate

13

resort.

14

precisely the resort that Congress has provided.

15

But that begs the question, that seems to be

MR. OLSON:

Well, I'm not making myself clear, I

16

think, is that the importance of Section 5 was to invite

17

the state to do things that would avoid the chaos and the

18

conflict and the controversy and the unsettled situation

19

that this country faced in 1876, and --

20
21
22

QUESTION:

Mr. Olson, did Section 15 exist when

McPherson was decided?
MR. OLSON:

I don't know, Justice Scalia. I

23

don't know the answer to that, when it was adopted. I

24

can't recall whether it was a part of the 1887 electoral

25

count statute or not.

I can probably answer that in
22

1

regard --

2
3

QUESTION:

That would make a difference,

wouldn't it?

4

MR. OLSON:

Well, it seems to me it wouldn't

5

make a difference, because of this.

It might -- yes, it

6

certainly might make a difference one way, but it still

7

wouldn't make a difference because our concept here, and I

8

think it's quite a rational and actually the only

9

explanation for how you can put these provisions together,

10

Article II and Section 5, and Congress' desire to avoid

11

the very controversy, chaos, conflict, which even --

12

QUESTION:

Well, but Section 15 assumes that

13

there is controversy and chaos.

14

MR. OLSON:

15

QUESTION:

Yes.
Section 15 isn't providing for

16

challenges except in situations perhaps exactly like this

17

one.

18

MR. OLSON:

But that's what the country -- what

19

essentially Section 15, although it modifies it and

20

structures it somewhat, it was still a situation that

21

Congress was facing in 1876 when it was dealing with the

22

Hayes-Tilden election.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. OLSON:

25

Right.
And by the time it got there, there

were dueling slates of electors that were buying -- there
23

1

were exchanges and a lot of things that everyone felt was

2

very destructive to the country.

3

QUESTION:

But Congress had to face the

4

constitutional fact that under Article II, it could not,

5

or its understanding was certainly, that it could not

6

mandate certain state procedures.

7

legislature shall decide what they are.

8

MR. OLSON:

9

QUESTION:

Article II did say the

Correct.
So the most that Congress could do in

10

providing for a more orderly resolution of what happened

11

in Hayes-Tilden was to do what it did in Section 5, and

12

that is to say if you do certain things, you can depend

13

upon the results, recognizing that the state might not do

14

those things.

15

present time it is provided in Article, in Section 15,

16

that if you don't do those things, there is a sequence of

17

issues that can be raised to be decided by the Congress.

18

And it then provided, or at least at the

If Congress wanted this Court to get into the

19

issue at this stage, it seems passing strange to me that

20

despite all the elaborateness of Section 15 there wouldn't

21

have been some mention of Federal litigation proceeding in

22

the Section 15 proceeding.

23

MR. OLSON:

I think that's a very important

24

point, and let me make it:

That Congress did say if you

25

do these things, certain consequences will flow from it.
24

1

Florida did these things, and we submit that there is,

2

that the courts are here to protect the benefit of the

3

bargain that Florida made when it responded to that

4

invitation, because --

5

QUESTION:

We have to separate your statutory

6

argument from your Constitutional argument. To the extent

7

that you are relying just on the Constitution, do you

8

think that Congress could by Section 15 exclude the courts

9

from adjudicating the constitutionality of what the state

10

has done?

11

MR. OLSON:

12

QUESTION:

No, I don't think so.
But it certainly could express its

13

preference for a scheme whereby the initial litigation, if

14

you will, at this level, would take place in the Congress.

15

To acknowledge that is not to say that the issue is

16

justiciable or that this Court has somehow been

17

necessarily excluded from the process for all time.

18

simply to say that the first line of litigation at the

19

Federal level seems under the statute to be Congress, and

20

not the Court.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. OLSON:

It is

Isn't that a fair reading of 15?
That's not a fair reading of Section

23

5, and let me answer this question, and I would like with

24

the Court's permission to reserve the time --

25

QUESTION:

Well, I don't think Section 5 goes to
25

1

the issue.

2

Section 15.

3

The question is whether it's a fair reading of

MR. OLSON:

I don't think that they can be read

4

in isolation.

I think that Section 5 was designed to

5

avoid the problem created by the controversy and the

6

having to resolve this in Congress, which is exactly what

7

did happen in 1876, and was a very unsatisfactory

8

situation.

9

QUESTION:

And in 1876, Congress did not have --

10

QUESTION:

1877.

11

QUESTION:

-- the rules with --

12

QUESTION:

1877.

13

QUESTION:

Congress did not have the rules with

14

respect to conclusiveness that it now has under Section 5.

15

MR. OLSON:

That's right.

And it put those

16

rules with respect to conclusiveness into Section 5.

17

Florida legislature bought into that scheme and now the

18

Florida Supreme Court, which doesn't have any

19

Constitutional authority pursuant to Section 2 to do so,

20

upset that scheme, deprived Florida of the benefit of

21

doing exactly what Congress wanted to have happen under

22

Section 5.

23

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH P. KLOCK, JR.

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS KATHERINE HARRIS,

3

ET AL., IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONER

4
5

MR. KLOCK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

6

Our argument is simply addressed to issues

7

having to do with Florida law, and the point being raised

8

by the Secretary is this, that the law in the state of

9

Florida on November 7 was changed by the Supreme Court of

10

Florida's decision on November 21. The Secretary is not

11

contesting the right of the Florida Supreme Court to

12

change the law of Florida, is simply pointing, she is

13

simply pointing out, that the law did change.

14

QUESTION:

Does the Secretary maintain that in

15

some instances she has a discretion that a court does not

16

or can a court do whatever she might do, under Florida

17

law?

18

MR. KLOCK:

Under Florida law, she has certain

19

discretion that I think a court probably does not have in

20

the protest period, Justice Kennedy, and that would be

21

that she had the discretion to decide whether or not

22

returns could be permitted after that seventh day, and

23

indeed that's based on two things that we have in the

24

record.

25

of Elections that talks about the circumstances in which

One is an opinion that was issued by the Division

27

1

the Secretary would exercise discretion, and the second is

2

the letter that the Secretary sent to the three or four

3

canvassing boards that requested an extension of time

4

after the 14th deadline had passed.

5

She sent the letter out, she said, please

6

indicate to me whether or not you intend to file returns

7

after the deadline, and if you do what the reasons are.

8
9

She collected a set of criteria, she applied the
criteria, and then sent a letter back, and what she did,

10

Justice Kennedy, in the case of the Division's letter, the

11

opinion which, of course, is binding under Florida law on

12

elections officials who receive them, she -- the Division

13

head said that there were certain circumstances such as

14

acts of God, hurricanes, and that kind of thing where the

15

discretion would be exercised.

16

additional reasons for considering whether or not she

17

would exercise her discretion, she indicated a number of

18

them which are also contained within the record.

19

the Joint Appendix at 21, she indicated where there was a

20

result of voter fraud with a substantial --

21

QUESTION:

It's at

She said she would exercise her

22

discretion.

23

discretion in those conditions?

24

MR. KLOCK:

When she came up with her

Did she say she would have to exercise her

I think she would have to exercise

her discretion.
28

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. KLOCK:

3

QUESTION:

4

The court did compel her to?
Yes, sir.
Do you think that was clear before

the opinion of the supreme court in this case?

5

MR. KLOCK:

6

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Let me just ask one general question

7

for your comment on whether it's a change in the law.

8

what extent, in your view, was the -- did the Supreme

9

Court of Florida consider itself bound by either prior

10

precedent or the constitution of the state which

11

preexisted?

12
13

MR. KLOCK:

In terms of handing down its

decision?

14
15

To

QUESTION:

In terms of the particular result it

reached in this case.

16

MR. KLOCK:

I believe the Supreme Court of

17

Florida was looking at its law in terms of articulating

18

the law that it wanted to have then and on a going-forward

19

basis.

20

court of the state, it has the right to do whatever it

21

wishes to do with respect to Florida law only bound by

22

whatever separation of powers --

23

What it did -- and obviously since it's the chief

QUESTION:

Do you think they thought their

24

decision was dictated either by prior precedent or by the

25

constitution of the state?
29

1

MR. KLOCK:

Your Honor, I don't know whether

2

they thought that or not, but that's not what the opinion

3

says.

4

they start out by talking about statutory construction,

5

and they hinge everything on the use of the word

6

interpret, and then they sort of turn the word interpret

7

to a use that it's not intended to be, but then when they

8

get to the point of designing the rule of law they're

9

going to go forward on, they don't talk about interpreting

As a matter of fact, the opinion is pretty clear,

10

the statute.

They then go and base it on principles of

11

equity in the Florida Constitution, and indeed what they

12

end up with, Your Honor, is this statement with respect to

13

the discretion that the Secretary is left with, and that

14

is this -- and it's on 35 of the Joint Appendix.

15

conclude that consistent with Florida's election scheme,

16

the Secretary may reject a Board's," that's the canvassing

17

board's, "amended returns only if the returns are

18

submitted so late that their inclusion will preclude a

19

candidate from contesting certification or preclude

20

Florida voters from participating fully in the Federal

21

electoral process."

22

Now, Your Honor, there's --

23

QUESTION:

24
25

I understand your position is that

was entirely new?
MR. KLOCK:

"We

Yes, sir.
30

1

QUESTION:

I'm just wondering, therefore your

2

submission is that it was not dictated by the constitution

3

or by prior precedent?

4

MR. KLOCK:

5

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.
I thought you said a moment ago that

6

the court, the Florida court did rely on the Florida

7

Constitution.

8

devoted to that.

9

There's a section of their opinion that's

MR. KLOCK:

Your Honor, in devising the remedy,

10

they refer to the Florida Constitution, but the issue that

11

we're here on, as I understand it, sir, is whether or not

12

the law changed.

13

right to do what they did. The only --

14

There's no question that they have a

QUESTION:

I think perhaps another statement of

15

the issue is to what extent did the Florida Supreme Court,

16

in construing this statute, rely on more general

17

provisions of the Florida Constitution which they cited in

18

their opinion?

19

MR. KLOCK:

I think they did rely, in creating

20

the remedy on the Florida Constitution, I believe they

21

created a right that had not previously been seen there,

22

which they have a right to do, but, Mr. Chief Justice, the

23

issue again is whether or not the law that they

24

articulated on November 21 is different than the law that

25

existed on November 7, and how the Secretary of State, in
31

1

exercising her discretion, was to divine the standard that

2

would be established on November 21.

3

QUESTION:

Your position is so long as it's

4

different, it violates Section 5 and therefore we have a

5

right to step in?

6

MR. KLOCK:

Well, Justice Scalia, we have not

7

addressed the Federal issues because, I mean, we're in a

8

situation where you have --

9
10

QUESTION:

Well, this is a Federal court what

are you here for, if you're not addressing --

11

MR. KLOCK:

I understand that, sir.

I

12

apologize.

13

have the Attorney General here, and the legislature has

14

filed by amicus, and of course the state has not appeared,

15

so it's a little unusual.

16

issues, but to answer your question, yes, sir.

17

But we have the Secretary of State here, we

QUESTION:

We haven't addressed those

Can you tell me when this petition

18

was filed here, the Secretary had not certified anybody

19

the winner, and now the Secretary has certified a winner,

20

and therefore, I guess, whether we win, whether your side,

21

the side you're supporting wins or loses, it doesn't

22

change that, and I guess that's moot, but my question is,

23

is there any respect in which this really makes a

24

difference, this case?

25

make a difference, numbers of vote, is that kind of thing

How?

I'm thinking, if it does

32

1

right for us to decide now?

How could it make a

2

difference?

3

or the other now in this case?

4

MR. KLOCK:

What's the consequence of our going one way

Your Honor, it makes an enormous

5

difference because the relief that has been requested

6

would be for the Court to determine that the law in effect

7

at the time of the election was that manual recounting of

8

ballots would not be permitted to address voter error,

9

which I think has been extensively --

10

QUESTION:

We don't have -- all -- suppose they

11

won and the relief was, suppose your side won, and the

12

relief was, fine, it should have been certified on

13

November 14th or 18th instead of November 26th.

14

what's the consequence of that? Just that?

15

what the reasoning is.

16

from that, that is real, adverse, you know, significant,

17

concrete that we can predict now as opposed to speculate?

18

MR. KLOCK:

Now,

Forgetting

Is there a consequence that flows

The only immediate result would be

19

that you would have a margin that instead of being 536

20

votes would be 900-some-odd votes, and it would only be

21

added to as a result of whatever was added by the overseas

22

ballots.

23

QUESTION:

Fine.

Then this case has said, we've

24

said a claim is not ripe if it rests upon contingent

25

future events that may not occur as anticipated or indeed
33

1

may not occur at all.

2

this realm of speculation as to whether or not it will or

3

will not make a difference, a difference to the outcome of

4

the election.

5

MR. KLOCK:

And so what I wonder, is this in

It will make a difference to the

6

outcome of the election because there is an ongoing

7

contest which is interrelated and is involved with the

8

Supreme Court's opinion, and of course because the Supreme

9

Court of Florida, in coming up with the remedy that they

10

came up with, completely changed the period of time from a

11

relatively short period of time, seven days for a protest

12

and much longer period for a contest, we now have a

13

situation where there is 19 days for the protest and 16

14

days for a contest.

15

QUESTION:

Well, it's too late -- it's too late

16

to lengthen the time for the contest.

17

extent that they have shortened the contest time, you

18

know, that's water over the dam right now, isn't it?

19
20
21

MR. KLOCK:

I mean, to the

Yes, Justice Scalia, but the issue

here -- I'm sorry.
QUESTION:

Is it not the case that if the votes

22

are, are as, as they have been shown to be under the

23

Florida Supreme Court's opinion, the race is much closer,

24

and therefore some counties under Florida law would

25

conduct recounts that otherwise would not conduct
34

1

recounts.

2

upon how likely it is that the recount is going to change

3

the outcome?

4

Doesn't whether a recount is conducted depend

MR. KLOCK:

Your Honor, if the law is returned

5

to the point it was on November 7, there is no right to a

6

manual recount to correct voter error, and that will end

7

the litigation that currently exists in the State of

8

Florida, which were the opinions of the Secretary of

9

State's Division of Elections that were issued and also

10

the state of the law as it existed at that point in time.

11

The record shows very clearly that there was no dispute

12

that there were any problems with voting machines or any

13

other tabulation problems with voting machines.

14

simply when they went through the process of what is,

15

Justice Ginsburg, a discretionary right to a manual

16

recount, not a mandatory one, when they went into that and

17

did the test, each of those canvassing boards did not find

18

any problem with a mechanical problem.

problem in terms of voter error.

implemented pursuant to the general election laws of the

State of Florida.

That manner is pursuant to a popular vote that's

In accordance with Article II of the

QUESTION:

I guess Article II permits the

legislature in general to make a choice that it could
itself select the electors?

11

MR. HANCOCK:

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

We agree

12

with that.

13

of the Florida government plays a role. For example, the

judiciary, or the executive branch of our government has

15

not found itself bound by the technical, hypertechnical

16

requirements of the election law.

that the, the executive branch has implemented a rule, not

An example of that is

Under the law of the State

In your brief you say, you conclude

24

that the Florida Supreme Court like, I think it's page 12,

like any state court, exercised its inherent equitable

powers to remedy a threat to fundamental constitutional

rights, and it rewrote the certification deadlines

setting the deadline.

Of course, the Constitution was there

15

before the election, the Due Process Clause is before the

16

election, but what we are talking about is having laws of

sufficient specificity and stability that people can rely

18

on them in advance and not have them changed after the

19

fact.

accordingly.

enviable standard, something we might all agree with in

the end, but as far as the requisite specificity to

25

satisfy 3 U.S.C. Section 5, I just don't see it as there.

And your brief makes it very clear that they

said, you know, seven days after, that's the date, and it

just does look like a very dramatic change made by the

Florida court, and I'm wondering if that is consistent in

5

that the result would be if it did go to Congress, it

6

would be a change.

7

MR. HANCOCK:

The -- I agree that the date was

implemented pursuant to the court's equitable powers.

9

Other than that, it was a routine exercise in statutory

10

construction.

11

of all where because of conflicting advice the counties

12

had started and then stopped conducting manual recounts

13

because of advice from the secretary of the state which

14

the supreme court ultimately concluded to be erroneous.

15

The court was faced with a situation first

QUESTION:

Yes.

And that advice was -- and this

16

was really the beginning of all of the problem, her advice

17

was that the provision providing for recounts, manual

18

recounts, not requiring them but giving them as one of the

19

options, only came into play when there was some defect in

20

the, in the machinery, and it was not available for voter

21

error, that is for voters who didn't punch the cards the

22

way they were supposed to.

23

came out with the opposite conclusion.

25

And the attorney, your office

The secretary's brief contends that that had
always been the rule in Florida.
39

Is that the case?

Do

of Florida for 100 years has put a duty on election

12

officials to discern the intent of the voter, and while

13

the secretary of the state refers to it as voter error,

14

when the ballot is punched, that's, under the laws of the

15

State of Florida as interpreted by the supreme court, that

16

voter has cast the ballot, even if the chad did not --

17

QUESTION:

But, I can say that the Supreme Court

Is it your position that any

18

interpretation the Supreme Court of Florida makes to

19

implement the will of the people is never a new law?

20

MR. HANCOCK:

The supreme -- yes.

I can't say

21

ever, but I'd say that on the case before the court, all

22

that was before the court was ordinary statutory

23

construction, which must be, the result of it whether this

24

Court would agree with it or disagree with it, must be

25

respected by this Court.

That's the very foundation of
40

1

federalism.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hancock, are you relying on the

3

Florida Supreme Court statement at least twice in its

4

opinion -- now I looked at the page to which Mr. Klock

5

referred, page 37-A, it says for the second time that

6

Section, the section governing manual recounts appears to

7

conflict with the sections that set a deadline, and it's

8

reconciling that conflict.

9
10
11
12

MR. HANCOCK:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Whether it was wrong or right, that's

what it said its mission was and that's what it did.
MR. HANCOCK:

Yes.

Both in words and in

13

operation, the statutes could not work together because of

14

the time for requesting manual recounts, the extent of the

15

job manual recounts --

16
17
18
19

QUESTION:

What is the section that requires

manual recounts?
MR. HANCOCK:

It's 102. -- well, 102.166

authorizes manual recounts.

20

QUESTION:

That's different from requires.

21

MR. HANCOCK:

Yes, but once it starts, Justice

22

Scalia, once it's authorized, if the initial sample

23

recount shows an error that might effect the outcome of

24

the election --

QUESTION:

Then -41

MR. HANCOCK:

The board is then required to,

among other things, conduct a full manual recount.

QUESTION:

No, no.

It's required to do one of

three things, one of which could be a manual recount.

could decide to do one of the other two instead.

QUESTION:

So there is really -- there is -- I

mean, the Court says that there is a requirement for a

10

manual recount but I don't see anything in the text of the

statute that requires a manual recount.

12

MR. HANCOCK:

The statute requires that the

election officials attempt to discern the cause of the

error.

15

counties, was that the machines were not able to read

16

ballots, 10,000 ballots in Palm Beach County, the machine

17

did not read as including a vote for president.

18

the issue so that the solution to that was not the

19

machines, even when they're operating properly would not

20

read these ballots, so what was left of the county

21

canvassing boards then was to do the full manual recount,

22

and the language of that statute again says they shall do

23

a full manual recount in those circumstances.

24
25

Here the cause of the error was that, in these

QUESTION:

That was

It says that the board may authorize

the manual recount, it doesn't require it. If it does
42

1

authorize it, then it tells it how to do it and says they

2

shall appoint as many counting teams as necessary,

3

presumably as necessary to do it within the time limit.

4

MR. HANCOCK:

Yes, Justice O'Connor, but, again

5

these -- under the law these requests can be made up to

6

the time of canvassing -- that means up to six or seven

7

days -- and also the number of ballots at issue here are

8

between 650,000 in Palm Beach County and also 900,000, up

9

to 900,000 in Broward County.

10

QUESTION:

If that is a statutory problem, the

11

court's resolution didn't really solve it, did it?

12

Because even with her extended time period the same

13

statutory problem exists.

14

under the extended deadlines for some of these counties

15

that have an enormous number of votes to conduct a manual

16

recount, isn't that right?

17

MR. HANCOCK:

18

QUESTION:

There still isn't enough time

Well, let me --

I mean to resolve a supposed conflict

19

in the statute in a manner that leaves in place the same

20

problem that existed before seems to me not a real

21

resolution of the statutory problem.

22

MR. HANCOCK:

The supreme court tried to blend

23

it all together to make it work, Justice Scalia, and again

24

it came up with a solution.

24
25

MR. TRIBE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I think I would want to note at the outset that
the alleged due process violation which keeps puffing up
44

1

and then disappearing and has as far as I can tell not

2

appeared at the state supreme court, did make one

3

appearance in the reply brief here, is really not before

4

the Court, and for understandable reasons, because

5

although it is part of the popular culture to talk about

6

how unfair it is to change the rules of the game, I think

7

that misses the point when the game is over, and when it's

8

over in a kind of photo finish that leaves people unsure

9

who won, and then the question is, how do you develop

10

great, sort of greater certainty, and a rather common

11

technique is a recount, sometimes a manual recount,

12

sometimes taking more time would be rather like looking

13

more closely at the film of a photo finish.

extraordinary.

MR. TRIBE:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

It's nothing

You're seeing no important policy in

No, no.
In fact, we can change the rules

after -- not important -- the popular culture -MR. TRIBE:

Certainly not, Justice Kennedy, but

22

I read U.S.C. Section 5 -- that is 3 U.S.C. Section 5 not

23

as a requirement that, for example, one never add

24

resources to checking how a particular ballot was cast.

25

If you look at the language, I think it's really much too
45

1

casual to say of it that all of the laws must stay fixed

2

in order to have the safe harbor apply.

3

argue in a few minutes, that's not really a question for

4

this Court, but for the Congress, but the language of

5

Section 5 is that -- and I'll just read what I think are

6

the key words, "if a state --"

7

QUESTION:

8

As I'll try to

Can you tell us where you're reading

from?

9

MR. TRIBE:

Actually, I'm just reading from a

copy of the U.S. Code, 3 U.S.C. Section 5, not from any --

11

the page I can identify --

MR. TRIBE:

Yes, although I'm afraid I don't

have it in front of me.

QUESTION:

17

MR. TRIBE:

18

It's in the appendix to the

Page 3A of the blue brief.
Thank you, Justice Souter. Page 3A

of the blue brief, I am reliably informed.

19

So if any state --

20

QUESTION:

21
22

That won't get you an extra two

minutes.
MR. TRIBE:

Well, I tried.

I tried.

If any

23

state shall have provided, and then it says by laws

24

enacted prior to the day fixed for the appointment of the

25

electors, a fancy way of saying election day, for the
46

1

final determination of any controversy or contest about

2

the appointment of electors -- and here's the key phrase,

3

I think -- by judicial or other methods or procedures at

4

least six days before the time fixed for the meeting of

5

the electors, that means in our situation, December 12,

6

then the final determination shall be conclusive and

7

govern the counting in Congress.

8
9

Now, the question for Congress, I suppose, would
be, although I don't see how this Court could get into

10

that question at this stage, but the question would be, is

11

a particular change extending a deadline for exigent

12

circumstances because a recount has been authorized, a

13

change in the judicial or methods of procedures for

14

resolving the contest.

15

QUESTION:

Let me just ask you a moment, you say

16

you don't think the statute permits this Court to get into

17

the matter at this time.

18

be any judicial review of a decision by the Congress to

19

count one set of electoral votes?

20

MR. TRIBE:

Are you suggesting there could

No, I don't think so, Mr. Chief

21

Justice, it's just that I don't trust my own imagination

22

to have exhausted all possibilities. For example, in the

23

case in, I think it was 1890, in Fitzgerald v. Green when

24

this Court held that only states can punish fraudulent

25

voting for presidential electors, it got into the act sort
47

1

of obliquely and at an angle, and that had a bearing on

2

the question of how the presidential electoral slate might

3

be composed, but it certainly didn't get into this.

4
5

QUESTION:

No, it certainly was quite different

from --

6

MR. TRIBE:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. TRIBE:

9

QUESTION:

Very.
-- this hypothetical.
That's certainly right.
You suggest in your reply brief that

10

it is not -- I think you said it's not self-evident that

11

the Florida legislature at this time has the right to

12

appoint any slate of delegates because the Congress has

13

set the date, and the date is the general election day.

14

If that is so, doesn't this mean that when we

15

talk -- think about justiciability, we must be very

16

careful to preserve the role of the Court.

17

or suggested here in your reply brief that the Florida

18

legislature now has no role.

19

this Court has no role.

20

Florida is it, so far as a judicial interpretation of the

21

consequences of 3 U.S.C. Section 5.

22

MR. TRIBE:

You have said

You are now suggesting that

That means the Supreme Court of

Well, Justice Kennedy, first of all

23

I do want to be clear that in our view the question of

24

whether and when and how the Florida legislature can enter

25

the picture is in no way presented here.
48

That paragraph

1

was intended to suggest that it's not obvious that the

2

views of some that there's no problem is right.

3

Secondly, if it were the case that the Florida

4

legislature could not simply decide, well, we're tired of

5

all this counting, we're moving in, and that this Court

6

cannot decide whether the conditions of 3 U.S.C. Section 5

7

are met, it would then remain only for Congress to make a

8

determination and adding the Florida legislature would

9

not, after all, have added an adjudication.

10

QUESTION:

And my point is that puts hydraulic

11

pressure on your nonjusticiability argument and makes it a

12

very, very important argument and a critical argument in

13

this case.

14

MR. TRIBE:

Well, perhaps, Justice Kennedy, but

15

I frankly can't see how it would affect the decision in

16

this case.

17

the highest court of the state.

18

others have suggested, it would ordinarily be the case,

19

surely, that one would not go out of one's way to read the

20

judgment as a breach of faith with the duties of trying to

21

reconcile provisions that are --

22

After all, you have before you a judgment of

QUESTION:

As Justice Ginsburg and

Well, I guess in the area, though, of

23

presidential electors it could be that that court, as all

24

courts would be, have to be informed, at least, by the

25

provisions of Section 5 in reviewing the laws enacted by
49

1

the legislature of the state.

2

somehow with the Florida courts that that statute was

3

there and that it might be in the state's best interest

4

not to go around changing the law after the election.

5

MR. TRIBE:

I mean, it had to register

Well, Justice O'Connor, I certainly

6

agree that if the Florida Supreme Court adverted to 3

7

U.S.C. Section 5, and as Justice Kennedy asked earlier,

8

got it wrong, then there would be a Federal issue for this

9

Court.

10
11

Would it be, I wonder, a Federal issue -QUESTION:

Court doesn't --

12

MR. TRIBE:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. TRIBE:

15

Well, is there a Federal issue if the

No.

The answer is no.

-- advert to that?
It would be nice.

But remember it

is --

16

QUESTION:

Because of Article II, which, after

17

all, does give the legislature plenary power and must have

18

wanted -- it must have wanted to have the laws in place so

19

that it wasn't -- so that Florida wouldn't risk losing its

20

electoral votes.

21

by enacting laws, and perhaps the Florida court has to be

22

aware of the consequences to the state of changing the

23

rules.

24
25

I mean, the legislature had to want that

MR. TRIBE:

But, Justice O'Connor, under Article

II, Section 1, Clause 2, the authority to regulate the
50

1

manner of the choice of electors is vested in the state

2

legislature.

3

beginning to exercise that authority by instructing the

4

various institutions, certainly not just the courts, the

5

attorney general, the secretary of state, in very

6

particular ways to exercise their roles in the process,

7

with a specific view of --

8
9
10

If the state legislature decides from the

QUESTION:
that date.

Well, it certainly did by enacting

Here is the certification date. How could it

have been clearer?

11

MR. TRIBE:

Well, I suppose it could be a

12

violation of Florida law if the enactment of that date is

13

construed as a direction to a particular authority like

14

the secretary of state or the state's highest court to

15

take certain actions in order to get the benefit of this

16

bonus, but only a violation of Federal law.

17

how you got a --

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. TRIBE:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. TRIBE:

Of state law.

I'm sorry.

Are you talking about the Florida

24
25

What Florida law would that be?

Constitution?

22
23

I don't see

QUESTION:

But then you run into the Blacker

case.
51

1

MR. TRIBE:

But it seems to me that the Federal

2

question, which is really what brings us here, can only

3

arise if 3 U.S.C. Section 5 is something other than what

4

Mr. Olson called the indemnification of the state.

5

QUESTION:

It can also arise under the section

6

of the Constitution that was construed in Blacker.

7

quite independent of 3 U.S. 5.

8

MR. TRIBE:

9
10

That's

That's right, if one concluded that

Florida had violated its duty to empower the legislature
to take these regulatory steps.

11

QUESTION:

If one concluded that the Florida

12

legislature had relied on the state constitution in a way

13

that the Blacker case says it may not in construing the

14

statute.

15

MR. TRIBE:

I think that's possible, Mr. Chief

16

Justice, but the judgment before you doesn't provide even

17

an inkling, I think of proof about those matters.

18

have --

All we

19

QUESTION:

That's what we have been arguing --

20

QUESTION:

As to whether it does or whether it

MR. TRIBE:

Well, I think we have been arguing

21
22

doesn't.

23

several interrelated things.

One of the things we have

24

been arguing is whether one could in good faith reach the

25

conclusion, novel as it was in some respects, as Justice
52

1

O'Connor points out, that the Florida Supreme Court

2

reached.

3

perhaps if there were a due process issue in this case,

4

and if someone had a protectable interest that was

5

injured, that would be relevant.

6

that makes that relevant here would arise only if one

7

forgot that 3 U.S.C. Section 5 is all carrot and no stick.

8

Now, if the answer to that question was no,

9

QUESTION:
Mr. Tribe.

No.

But the Federal question

I don't agree with you on that,

It seems to me a Federal question arises if

10

the Florida Supreme Court in its opinion rather clearly

11

says that we are using the Florida Constitution to reach

12

the result we reach in construing the statute.

13

Blacker is a strong argument they can't do that.

14
15
16

MR. TRIBE:

Well, that they can never avert to

their own constitution?
QUESTION:

Well, certainly it stands for the

17

proposition you couldn't do it then, in those

18

circumstances.

19

I think

MR. TRIBE:

Well, what would it be, I wonder,

20

about the circumstances here that would say that in

21

reconciling these provisions which at first we were told

22

were mandatory, then we were told they are not mandatory,

23

they give discretion, and now we are told that the real

24

issue is simply did the court in putting a boundary on

25

that discretion, do something federally impermissible.
53

1

What would it be about that sequence that would implicate

2

--

3

QUESTION:

Well, you know, if the Supreme Court

4

of Florida simply said in its opinion, look, these

5

sections of the statute conflict, we've got to under our

6

judicial principles resolve it one way or the other, but

7

-- but it doesn't say that.

8

the light of the Florida Constitution and the general

9

rights conferred there, we are construing it this way.

10

MR. TRIBE:

It goes on to say, look, in

It seems to me that as a tiebreaker,

11

as a way of shedding light on the provisions that are in

12

conflict, so long as it's not done in a way that conflicts

13

with a Federal mandate, they are not violating any --

QUESTION:

Mr. Tribe, I don't -- I don't agree

15

with that.

interpretation of this statute.

saying, having determined what the legislative intent was,

we find that our state constitution trumps that

to me, under Article II, because in fact there is no right

MR. TRIBE:

It seems to me that it's already

3

been conceded that the legislature can delegate that

4

function to the judiciary.

5

if it can delegate the function to the judiciary, and that

6

is what McPherson seems to suggest, then can it not

delegate something less, that is, can it not give the

judiciary a role of the sort that it's exercising here?

Isn't there another -- go on.

14

QUESTION:

No.

15

QUESTION:

Isn't there another way of looking at

That's all right.

16

what the Florida court did, and that was in effect to

17

apply the statute, the interpretative criterion, that

18

where there is any discretion for interpretation, an

19

unconstitutional result should be avoided, and because you

20

have here a statute as I understand it that regulates both

21

Federal and state recounts, that much is, I think is

22

clear.

23

MR. TRIBE:

24

QUESTION:

25

Right.
The only way to avoid an

unconstitutional meaning of the statute so far as Florida
56

1

law was concerned was to get into this constitutional

2

concern about preserving the franchise, and that because

3

the legislature intended one standard to cover both

4

Federal and state recounts, it therefore is valid to

5

consider the state constitution in order to derive a

6

general meaning that will apply to a Federal, as well as a

7

state election.

8
9

Can you look at it that way?

MR. TRIBE:

I fully accept that, Justice Souter.

I'd supplement it with one important point. We are not

10

dealing here with a decision in which within the gray area

where a court could reasonably go either way, this court

simply said we don't care about these Federal

considerations.

It in particular exercised its equitable

Can you -- can you just go back to

19

your characterization of the opinion.

20

all agree that given that the legislature has to select

21

22

the electors.

I suppose that's --

23

MR. TRIBE:

24

QUESTION:

25

I think we would

That's right.
All right, but thinking of this

opinion, suppose the court had said, look, we reach our
57

result based on the canons we found in Blackstone.

Now,

2

nobody is going to say they said Blackstone is selecting

3

the electors, right?

4

MR. TRIBE:

5

QUESTION:

I think that makes sense.
All right.

Now, I suppose they said,

6

we reached this decision based on the values found in the

7

Constitution.

8

they say, well, the legislature wants us to do X, but our

9

Constitution requires us to do not X.

10

That would be like Blackstone.

But suppose

Professor Tribe --- in such a way that -Isn't it also true, Professor Tribe,

that part 8 of the opinion relies on four things -- the

Florida Constitution, earlier Florida decisions construing

2

statutes, an Illinois case, and a Federal case.

3

MR. TRIBE:

Absolutely.

4

QUESTION:

Not just their constitution.

5

MR. TRIBE:

That's right, and surely --

6

QUESTION:

Is it also true that the inability to

7

use Section 7 depended in the Florida Supreme Court's

8

reasoning not on the existence of the constitution as the

9

sole reason, but on the inability to make the December 7

10

date final and provide for the recounts within the times

11

in which recounts can be called for.

12

didn't they say that the date of the 7th cannot stand, not

13

because of the constitution alone but because there are

14

other provisions in the statute that cannot be

15

accommodated with sections -- with the 7 date?

16
17
18

MR. TRIBE:

Exactly.

What I'm saying is,

They said that twice, and I think

that's critical if you add to that that we read a decision

of a state court in the light most favorable to that court

would be a possibility for this Court to remand for

clarification, but if there's two readings, one that's

Why bother with all the rest

You would bother with it because

having decided very clearly what the statute requires and

finding no way to get around the firm dates set, you say

the reason it's bad is because of the state constitution.

25

That's how it's written.
61

1

MR. TRIBE:

2

QUESTION:

3

But, Justice Scalia -They might have tried it another way,

but it seems to me they didn't --

4

MR. TRIBE:

They also say that the provision

5

that reaches the result that conflicts with the authorized

6

recounts was written in 1951, that in 1989 they wrote a

7

provision that unmistakably created discretion, and we

8

haven't yet discussed this provision, also created the

9

provision that when the returns are filed late, it doesn't

10

say throw them away, it doesn't say give them back, it

11

says fine every member of the canvassing board $200 a day.

12

That would be a totally crazy provision.

13

understands, if you were not to reach a reconciliation of

14

this sort, this result was overdetermined under Florida

15

law.

16

also points this way, but there isn't a sentence in the

opinion that suggests that without that constitutional

argument the result would have to be different.

What is the November 26th date? Is

that the seven day date moved or is that some kind of a

has to accept the late returns? Did it move the date from

MR. TRIBE:

2

exercise of the chancellor's foot, as it were, in this

3

particular case.

4

couldn't come up with an algorithm or a formula that would

5

generate it, but the court was confronted with the task of

6

drawing, as this Court has recognized, what are sometimes

7

inevitably arbitrary lines; that is, it said it was not

8

consistent with the overall scheme of the statute to

9

require these recounts, which had just begun, to

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. TRIBE:

15
16

If the legislature --- in the pauper's will.

Why tell

people the count if you won't count it?
QUESTION:

And if the legislature had jumped

17

into the breach and said this same thing, would that be a

18

new statute or new enactment under 5 U.S.C.?

19

MR. TRIBE:

I -- honestly, Justice Kennedy, I'm

20

not sure because the language that I quoted from 3 U.S.C.

21

Section 5 focuses on the institutional dispute resolution

22

arrangement that is in place, and if you look at the

23

legislative history in the decade of hearings in the

24

period after the Hayes-Tilden debacle, that history

25

focused on the importance of having a fixed tribunal which
63

1

you could look to rather than one cooked up at the last

2

moment, and indeed what they seem to be most afraid of was

3

the political entry of legislators and executives at the

4

11th hour.

5

There was no focus at all.
QUESTION:

But are you saying you can't tell us

6

whether they, in the hypothetical, supposed that it would

7

be a new enactment?

8
9

MR. TRIBE:
on the subject.

Well, there are certainly no cases

The language gives me very little

10

guidance.

11

neither my opinion about it nor the Court's opinion is

12

necessarily --

13

Since the section is addressed to Congress,

QUESTION:

You don't think you could tell us

14

what you might advise the Congress if you were the counsel

15

for the Judiciary Committee.

16

MR. TRIBE:

I think I would advise the Congress

17

that it is not a new enactment, that it is an entirely

18

reasonable construction of an existing enactment as to

19

which the only alternative construction is to make it

20

self-destruct, and to make it internally contradictory,

21

and I honestly don't think if I were advising Congress

22

that I would say it's a new construction.

23

I do think, also, that some people reasonably

24

could argue the contrary, and I guess I think that this

25

language should be interpreted whether by a court or by
64

1

Congress in a way that gives some deference to the state

2

government and its organs, and I think any degree of

3

deference here is inconsistent with saying that there's

4

been a Federal violation, especially when -- I want to

5

remind us all about the context.

6

this paragraph in this opinion says that Florida is in

7

breach of Article II of the Constitution in general? Hard

8

to say.

Are we going to say that

I don't think so.

9

QUESTION:

There should perhaps be some

10

deference, though, to the concept expressed in Article II,

11

that it is the authority of the legislature and some

12

special concern about what the legislature may have said.

13

MR. TRIBE:

Yes, but if the legislature is

14

entirely happy not to completely delegate this power to

15

the courts, which Article II would permit, but rather to

16

allow the courts to exercise a somewhat more flexible role

17

than the one that the critic of this opinion would be

18

embracing.

19

Florida.

20

That's within the power of the legislature of

QUESTION:

Yeah, but who would have thought that

21

the legislature was leaving open the date for change by

22

the court?

23

Who would have thought that?
MR. TRIBE:

Anyone.

If you just read the

24

statute in 1989 and it says may.

25

65

It says she may reject

QUESTION:

That doesn't change -- that's not the

date.

3

MR. TRIBE:

No, the date is the one from which

4

the may is measured.

That is, you're supposed to get it

5

in by seven days later.

6

don't, she may or she may not reject them.

7

reading that would realize that's a deadline only in a

8

kind of Pickwickian sense.

9

She's got discretion. Certainly if there's an act of God

What if you don't? Well, if you
Now, anybody

It's not a real deadline.

10

of the sort Justice -- was it Justice Stevens? -- asked

11

about --

12

QUESTION:

Yes, well, then the Secretary came in

13

and argued and said, yes, her discretion was if it were an

14

act of God or a machine breakdown she would exercise her

15

discretion.

16

MR. TRIBE:

And it's an entirely normal exercise

17

of judicial interpretation to say that this statute is not

18

limited to God and machines.

19

QUESTION:

Professor Tribe, can I ask you why

20

you think the Florida legislature delegated to the Florida

21

Supreme Court the authority to interpose the Florida

22

Constitution?

23

legislative branch is different from mine, but in my

24

experience they are resigned to the intervention of the

25

courts, but have certainly never invited it.

I mean, I -- maybe your experience with the

66

1
2

MR. TRIBE:

Well, I have to say my experience

parallels that --

3

QUESTION:

What makes you think the Florida

4

legislature affirmatively invited the Florida Supreme

5

Court?

6

MR. TRIBE:

The odd thing is that the system in

7

Florida involves their own repromulgation of the

8

constitution, and their scheme with respect to the

9

resolution of disputes over elections draws a sharp

10

distinction between elections to their own House and

11

Senate, which they won't trust the courts with as far as

12

they can throw them.

13

in the House and Senate, and all others are to be resolved

14

in the courts under a standard that they understandably

15

preferred.

16

QUESTION:

Those are to be resolved exclusively

They are resigned, that they are

17

resigned to, but they need not be resigned to the Florida

18

Supreme Court interposing itself with respect to Federal

19

elections, they need not be because the Florida

20

Constitution cannot affect it.

21

implausible that they really invited the Florida Supreme

22

Court to interpose the Florida Constitution between what

23

they enacted by statute and the ultimate result of the

24

election.

25

MR. TRIBE:

And I -- I just find it

Well, I suppose if they were at all
67

1

far-sighted, if they looked at their own work and saw how

2

self-contradictory it was, they might say we would want

3

someone with the authority to reconcile these provisions

4

to do so in the light not only of the literal language but

5

of the fact that they are dealing with something very

6

important, the franchise, that disenfranchising people,

7

which is what this is all about, disenfranchising people

8

isn't very nice.

9
10
11
12

QUESTION:
MR. TRIBE:

Wouldn't justice -And it violates the Federal as well

as the state Constitution.
QUESTION:

But wouldn't Justice Scalia's

13

suggestion be a stronger suggestion if they had dealt by

14

the statute only with Federal elections or only with a

15

presidential election as opposed to dealing with both

16

state and Federal in the same statute?

17

MR. TRIBE:

Well, it's not uncommon, given the

18

convenience of having similar regulations apply on

19

election day not to bifurcate.

20

all, confronted the nation with a problem --

21

QUESTION:

Right.

Oregon v. Mitchell, after

But when they -- when they

22

don't bifurcate, it's reasonable to suppose that they

23

expect their statute to be construed, number one, as one

24

statute, not as having different dates for different, for

25

state and Federal; and, number two, to be construed so far
68

1

as the state concern arises in accordance with the state

2

Constitution, and if that is so, then the result is they

3

would expect a state constitutional concern to inform

4

their interpretation of a statute which ultimately governs

5

Federal as well as state.

6

MR. TRIBE:

And they would recognize that when

7

the Federal election involved the presidency of the United

8

States with the special problems of the Electoral College

9

deadline, they might emerge with rather different

10

deadlines and to some extent a different approach for the

11

-- to elections.

12

QUESTION:

But there are already different

13

deadlines for Federal elections, aren't there, because of

14

the Federal statute concerning overseas ballots?

15
16

MR. TRIBE:

QUESTION:

MR. TRIBE:

And there is an administrative order

--

21
22

So that's, that's going to be

different anyway.

19
20

That's -- that's entirely

true.

17
18

Yes.

QUESTION:

But it's as a result of Federal law,

isn't it?

MR. TRIBE:

Well, there is a consent decree

QUESTION:

But it wasn't the legislature's

choice, it was Congress' choice that required that.

3

MR. TRIBE:

That's right.

In 1986, there was a

4

congressional statute that already created that

5

difference.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Tribe, before you finish, I would

7

like to know whether you are conceding some of the things

8

you said.

9

legislature under Article II, Section 1, could say we

Sounds like maybe you are.

But the Florida

10

don't want any judicial review of anything about the

11

manner in which we say electors should be appointed.

12

the Florida legislature have the authority to cut out

13

judicial review?

14

MR. TRIBE:

No.

Does

No, I certainly don't think so.

15

They cut out judicial review -- even this may not be

16

entirely consistent with the Florida Constitution.

17

cut out judicial review for the election of their own

18

members in the House and Senate.

19

they would have the authority to expel the Federal

20

judiciary from the election of senators and

21

representatives.

22

QUESTION:

No.

They

I certainly don't think

1

May the legislature direct as to the Florida

Supreme Court, and Florida Supreme Court we don't want you

3

to review whatever we do?

4

MR. TRIBE:

I'm not actually clear about that,

5

Justice Ginsburg.

6

seems to me that under Smiley v. Holm and similar cases,

7

the general principle is that the Constitution takes the

8

state government and its arrangement as it finds it, and

9

that when the legislature is identified, that really does

10

not mean the legislature in some specialized capacity, as

11

with Article V.

12

I have thought about it a lot.

It

Now, if that's the case and if it's therefore

13

assumed that the legislature is surrounded with both

14

executive and judicial authority, then a decision by the

15

legislature to completely exclude the judiciary from any

16

possible role, the state judiciary, might be inconsistent

17

with the underlying meaning of Article II itself.

18

QUESTION:

Well, could the state legislature at

19

least now say in light of all this confusion, we enact a

20

law today saying this is the way electors will be

21

selected?

22

Is that open to the legislature now?
MR. TRIBE:

I'm not sure.

That's very much like

23

my inability to answer because I honestly have not reached

24

a conclusion that it's not presented by this case.

MR. OLSON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. May it

It seems to me that it's very difficult

10

to read the Florida Supreme Court decision as saying

11

anything else other than the Florida Constitution in their

12

view, in that court's view, is trumping everything else.

13

The second paragraph of the conclusion says because the

14

right to vote is the preeminent right in the declaration

15

of rights of the Florida Constitution and so forth, this

16

opinion is full of language --

17

QUESTION:

But suppose they refer to the

18

declaration of the rights of man, to 1789, the French

19

revolution, I mean, the right to vote is a value in the

20

constitution.

21

it?

Are they actually saying -- I didn't see

22

MR. OLSON: They are sayihng --

23

QUESTION:

Or are they are saying the statute

24

means one thing, but the statute is unconstitutional

25

because the Constitution of Florida says the opposite.
72

I

1
2

didn't see that.
MR. OLSON:

I think that the only reasonable

3

fair reading of the decision is that the Florida Supreme

4

Court felt that, and it says it over and over again, that

5

we are going to be -- attempt to discern the will of the

6

people, the will of the electorate and discern, and

7

enhance in whatever way we possibly can the right to vote.

8

And because of that, these provisions of the statute which

9

are very much quintessentially legislative, the timetables

10

that are involved in this statute, particularly the

11

November 14th deadline, is a part of a composite package.

12

There is one week for a protest and certain recounts to
