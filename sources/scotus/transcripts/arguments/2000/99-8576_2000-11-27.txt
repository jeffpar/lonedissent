CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

next in Number 99-8576, Paul Glover v. United States.
Mr. Waldman.

Mr. Waldman, after reading the

6

briefs it seems to me that the Government has pretty well

7

conceded the question presented here, and is asking for

8

affirmance on alternate grounds.

cases on the basis of concessions, but you might be well

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL L. WALDMAN

13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

14
15
16

MR. WALDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In this case, the district court and then the

17

court of appeals concluded that an additional 6 to 21

18

months in prison caused by counsel's deficient performance

19

was not sufficiently significant to satisfy the prejudice

20

prong of the ineffective assistance of counsel standard.

21

We believe the lower court's attempt to transform this

22

Court's prejudice analysis under Strickland into a

23

requirement that defendant show a significant increase in

24

their term of imprisonment is misplaced.

25

should reject a significant prejudice test as inconsistent
3

This Court

1

with Strickland and this Court's prior treatment of the

2

prejudice test, as inconsistent with this Court's prior

3

holding in Argesinger v. Hamlin that the right to counsel

4

applies where any term of imprisonment is imposed, and

5

because a significant prejudice test is unworkable and

6

unfair.

7

Also in this case, as Mr. Chief Justice has

8

noted, the Government agrees with Glover on the basic

9

issue that the Seventh Circuit's significant prejudice

10

test is incorrect.

The Government, however, raises a host

11

of alternative grounds for affirmance in its brief on the

12

merits.

13

raised by the Government in the court of appeals, not

14

addressed by any lower court, not encompassed within the

15

question presented in the petition for certiorari, and not

16

persuasive even when examined on their own merits, this

17

Court should not reach these new arguments, but should

18

leave them to the lower courts to be addressed on remand.

Because these new Government arguments were not

Would it also be open to the lower

incorrect?

25

now we want to reassess that and give him the extra

1

points?

2

MR. WALDMAN:

Your Honor, I think the issues as

3

to what arguments have been waived, what arguments -- by

4

the Government or by Mr. Glover, whether to do a

5

recalculation is something that would have to be sorted

6

out by the Seventh Circuit, and I think that is one of the

7

very reasons why remand to the lower court is appropriate

8

in this case.

9

In Strickland v. Washington, this Court

10

established the prejudice prong for demonstrating

11

ineffective assistance of counsel.

12

defendant must show that but for counsel's unprofessional

13

errors the results of the proceeding would have been

14

different.

15

Court has quoted and adhered to this difference in result

16

language from Strickland.

17

It stated that a

In numerous decisions since Strickland, this

The court of appeals erroneously derived the

18

significant prejudice test by misreading this Court's

19

decision in Lockhart v. Fretwell.

20

misinterpreted Lockhart v. Fretwell as modifying the

21

normal Strickland test by purportedly adding a new, more

22

rigorous prejudice requirement.

23

Taylor, this Court rejected the proposition that Lockhart

24

has announced a new higher standard for showing prejudice.

25

This Court in Williams reiterated that Strickland's
5

The circuit court

Last term, in Williams v.

1

difference-in-result test remained the standard to be

2

applied in virtually all cases.

3

in its own words, a mere difference in outcome was

4

sufficient to satisfy the prejudice prong.

5

Glover's counsel's ineffective performance led Mr. Glover

6

to receive an additional 6 to 21 months in prison, clearly

7

a difference in outcome.

8
9

Williams emphasized that,

Here, Mr.

We also believe that this Court should be guided
by its decision in Argesinger v. Hamlin.

There, the Court

10

held that any term of imprisonment, no matter how short,

11

implicates the constitutional right to counsel.

12

Consistent with Argesinger and its progeny, this Court

13

should not tolerate 6 to 21 months of undeserved

14

imprisonment caused by the ineffective performance of

15

counsel.

16

Furthermore, as the Government itself notes in

17

its brief, a significant prejudice test is unworkable.

18

One sees this problem in the decision of the district

19

court below, where the district court struggled to figure

20

out whether 6 to 21 months in prison was sufficiently

21

significant.

22

the significant prejudice test for a number of years, it

23

remains unclear whether the significant increase in

24

sentence refers to some percentage change, some absolute

25

number of months, or some other factor.

Although the court of appeals has employed

6

1

For example, if significance is measured in

2

offense levels, as some courts have stated, the two

3

offense levels such as occurred in Mr. Glover's case, a

4

two-offense-level change can be as much as 8 or 9

5

additional years in prison in some cases, depending on the

6

crime and the characteristics of the offense.

7

QUESTION:

8

incarcerated?

9

incarceration?

10

Mr. Waldman, is your client still

Does this case affect his actual

MR. WALDMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

He has served

11

approximately 5 years of his term, but he has another 13

12

months remaining, so a favorable result on a section 2255

13

motion would allow him to be released.

14

We don't believe that one can seriously argue

15

that 8 or 9 additional years imprisonment which are

16

undeserved, and caused only by counsel's errors, can ever

17

be considered insignificant.

18

more basic point, the point which we believe lies at the

19

core of Argesinger, of Strickland, and the right to

20

counsel cases, which is that any term of imprisonment

21

which is undeserved and resulted from a lack of effective

22

counsel cannot be permitted to stand.

Moreover, we would make the

23

Turning to the new arguments in the Government's

24

brief on the merits, although now agreeing with Mr. Glover

25

that the lower courts erred in applying a significant
7

1

prejudice test, the Government goes on on its brief on the

2

merits to raise a variety of new grounds for affirmance.

3

The Government argues that Mr. Glover's counsel did not

4

perform deficiently at all.

5

that the Wilson case requiring grouping offenses such as

6

Mr. Glover's, that that case was wrongly decided by the

7

court of appeals and should be overruled by this Court.

8
9

The Government now argues

Finally, the Government now argues that
correctly recalculated under Wilson, in its view, Mr.

10

Glover's sentence would actually be increased.

11

these alternative grounds were not properly raised

12

previously in this case, and should not be addressed by

13

this Court in the first instance.

14

Government arguments were never presented to the court of

15

appeals.

16

court below, that 6 to 21 additional months in prison did

17

not satisfy the significant prejudice test established by

18

the Seventh Circuit, and we attach, in our -- as Appendix

20

of appeals.

decisions below to dismiss Mr. Glover's petition.

In these circumstances, this Court should not

5

merits.

6

as well as the numerous cases that we cite at pages 7 and

7

Court is not to address issues which appear for the first

9

time in the merits brief to this Court.

practice.

14

of great national import.

15

arguments involve complicated and detailed applications of

16

the sentencing guidelines and lower court procedures and

17

decisions.

18

this Court should not be addressing.

19

The Government's arguments do not raise

Rather, the Government's new

These are precisely the types of issues which

As this Court noted in Braxton v. United States,

20

this Court should be, in its own words, restrained and

21

circumspect in resolving sentencing guidelines

22

interpretation issues, since Congress expressly provided

23

the Sentencing Commission with the power to resolve issues

24

involving conflicts in interpretation of the sentencing

25

guidelines.
10

1

Here in particular, the Sentencing Commission

2

has announced that as one of its priorities this year it

3

will be examining the guidelines interpretation of section

4

3(d)1.2, which is the very section which the Government is

5

asking the Court to review.

6

This Court will also occasionally resolve issues

7

which were not raised below, where there is an obvious

8

plain error which this Court can quickly and easily

9

dispose of.

That also is not the case here.

As we

10

demonstrate at pages 12 through 20 of our reply brief, not

11

only are these issues not easily resolved, but the

12

Government's new arguments at the end of the day are

13

simply without merit.

14

The Government argues that there was no

15

deficient performance by Glover's counsel, yet Glover's

16

counsel on appeal never raised the issue of grouping the

17

kickback and money laundering offenses.

18

officer's report had recommended grouping, and at least

19

three circuits had ruled in favor of such grouping.

20

This was a pure legal issue.

The probation

It was a strong

21

viable claim that his appellate counsel should have

22

raised, and which, as the Wilson case shows us, would have

23

prevailed.

24

two claims which were raised by Mr. Glover's counsel on

25

appeal.

This grouping issue was far superior to the

These two claims involve challenges on
11

1

evidentiary and fact-findings by the district judge where

2

the standard of review required Glover's counsel to make

3

his case by clear error.

4

Ultimately the court of appeals found that these

5

two claims raised by Glover's counsel were wholly

6

unfounded, in its words, involved no error whatsoever, let

7

alone clear error, and also again in the opinion it says

8

it was not a -- these are not a close call.

9

grouping claim with those claims which he did assert, we

Comparing the

10

submit that Glover's appellate counsel clearly acted

11

outside the scope of a reasonably competent attorney in

12

not raising this grouping issue on appeal.

13

We also believe that it was clearly deficient

14

performance to not bring the Wilson case, a -- the Seventh

15

Circuit's new case which controlled this issue and was

16

directly on point, to not bring it to the attention of the

17

panel in Mr. Glover's case, even though that case was

18

still pending when Wilson was decided.

19

As to the Government's other elaborate

20

challenges to the sentencing guidelines calculation, we

21

believe that the Seventh Circuit's decisions in Wilson I

22

and Wilson II are controlling and correct.

23

has offered no compelling justification for this Court to

24

review these decisions, or to overrule their sound

25

reasoning.

The Government

QUESTION:

Was Glover's counsel on the first

2

appeal, was it retained counsel or furnished by the

3

Government?

4

MR. WALDMAN:

Retained counsel, Your Honor.

In summary, the Government's various new

arguments are inappropriate for this Court to address in

9

the lower courts.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

19

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

20
21
22

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We agree with petitioner that the Seventh

23

Circuit erred in adopting a significant difference test

24

for measuring the prejudice inquiry under Strickland v.

25

Washington.

We believe, however, that the judgment in
13

1

this case is correct, because petitioner's counsel at

2

trial and direct appeal neither rendered deficient

3

performance nor gave rise to prejudice.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, why didn't the

5

Government tell us this in the response to the petition

6

for certiorari?

7

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice O'Connor, at the stage

8

when we responded to the petition, we told the Court that

9

we thought the judgment was correct.

We did not defend

10

the rationale of the Seventh Circuit and, in fact,

11

indicated that the Seventh Circuit might wish to

12

reconsider it in light of this Court's intervening

13

decision in Williams v. Taylor and a Fifth Circuit

14

decision that had criticized it, but we had not formally

15

concluded our analysis of whether at the end of the day we

16

would or would not defend the approach that the Seventh

17

Circuit adopted at the time we filed our response to the

18

certiorari position.

19

After we told the Court not to grant the case,

20

and the Court disagreed and granted it, we then undertook

21

a complete analytical review of the Seventh Circuit's

22

approach and concluded that we could not submit that this

23

Court could affirm that approach consistent with its own

24

cases and principles governing the ineffective assistance

25

analysis, but we continued to believe that the judgment in
14

1

this case as rendered by the Seventh Circuit was correct

2

on alternative bases.

3

QUESTION:

But those grounds would be hard for

4

us, really, to address here for the first time, at least

5

on the grouping question.

6

below, and the Sentencing Commission is considering a

7

change, particularly hard for us to deal with.

8
9

MR. DREEBEN:

There's a five to five split

I agree, Justice O'Connor, that

the sentencing guidelines question and the intricacies

10

related to whether money laundering should be grouped with

11

the underlying offense are both complicated and the kind

12

of issue that this Court would ordinarily properly leave

13

to the Sentencing Commission to resolve, particularly

14

since the Sentencing Commission is aware of it.

15

We presented that analysis on the prejudice

16

prong of the case in order to illustrate how very

17

complicated the guidelines decisions that counsel faces

18

are when deciding whether to raise a particular claim or

19

not to raise a particular claim.

20

matters that are quite complex in Federal criminal law,

21

and more complex than most decisions that counsel has to

22

make, and it is therefore highly relevant to what this

23

Court says, if anything, about the proper analysis and

24

performance when counsel is charged with having failed to

25

raise a sentencing guidelines claim that the client later
15

These are intricate

1

believes that he should have raised.

2

The Seventh Circuit --

3

QUESTION:

That would come up, Mr. Dreeben, only

4

if we dealt on the merits with your effort to affirm on an

5

alternate ground.

6

MR. DREEBEN:

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

7

The fundamental point that the Seventh Circuit was trying

8

to make in adopting its significant difference test was

9

that there are a multitude of guidelines questions that

10

confront counsel who is handling a sentence or a

11

sentencing guidelines question on appeal, and that if it

12

were the case that any guidelines error could support

13

collateral relief, the defendant would often get the

14

chance for two full bites at the apple at sentencing

15

questions, first at trial and on direct appeal, and second

16

on collateral review, and --

17

QUESTION:

That may be, but it's hard to say

18

that's what the Seventh Circuit was talking about.

They

19

say Glover, to win on ineffective assistance he'd have to

20

show his counsel performed below a constitutional

21

threshold and that the deficient performance prejudiced

22

him.

23

performed inadequately, the second prong, prejudice, is

24

missing here, and then they go on to discuss that, so it

25

seems to me they didn't say one single word about was,

Even if we were to assume that Glover's attorneys

16

1

what was or what was not inadequate performance.

2

MR. DREEBEN:

I quite agree, Justice Breyer, and

3

my point is that the considerations that drove the Seventh

4

Circuit to adopt its rule on prejudice are actually far

5

more pertinent to analyzing the performance prong.

6

Sentencing guidelines claims, as the Court

7

knows, are not only complex but can have unpredictable

8

outcomes, and can --

9

QUESTION:

But Mr. Dreeben, may I just stop you

10

there to confirm that you recognize the Second Circuit did

11

not pass on the adequacy of the performance.

12

will assume, for purposes of this decision, that the

13

performance was inadequate.

14

prejudice.

It said, we

Even so, there was no

15

So we don't even have an answer in the first

16

instance on the deficiency of the performance from the

17

Seventh Circuit.

18

a matter of first view?

19

Why should we handle such a question as

MR. DREEBEN:

I think, Justice Ginsburg, the

20

reason why it is relevant for the Court to say something

21

about the performance issue, which was not addressed

22

squarely by the Seventh Circuit -- we did argue it in the

23

district court and the district court didn't address it

24

either, so it has not been resolved by the courts below,

25

but it is highly interrelated with the prejudice inquiry
17

1

in a sentencing guidelines ineffective assistance

2

collateral attack, and the point that the Seventh Circuit

3

was trying to make was to give courts a way to weed out

4

these collateral attacks in an efficient way.

5

QUESTION:

Well, why not let the Seventh Circuit

6

make it, because looking at its current decision, all it

7

said is, we're going to assume for purposes of this

8

decision that counsel's performance was inadequate.

9

MR. DREEBEN:

I agree that the Seventh Circuit

10

hasn't resolved it, but this Court is going to announce a

11

decision that will be influential in the way that the

12

lower courts address comparable sentencing guidelines

13

ineffective assistance of counsel cases, and I think that

14

it would be useful for the lower courts to have some

15

guidance from this Court as to some of the relevant

16

considerations and factors that ought to be brought to

17

bear on the performance inquiry.

18

QUESTION:

There's really nothing novel about

19

the points you make concerning adequacy of counsel's

20

performance.

21

you can't raise too many either at the trial level or

22

especially on appeal, you have to pick your good targets,

23

this wasn't a good target -- I mean, it's all standard

24

analysis, it seems to me.

25

You say, you know, these are complex issues,

I could understand it if you were presenting to
18

1

this Court some novel new theory of counsel inadequacy

2

that we have to signal to the lower courts, but there's

3

really nothing bizarre about the arguments you're making.

4

They're standard adequacy-of-counsel arguments, aren't

5

they, and can't we leave them to the Second -- Seventh

6

Circuit to figure out?

7

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I hope they're not bizarre,

8

but I do think that the arguments that we've made have

9

gone a little bit beyond what you, Justice Scalia, have

10

just accurately described as where this Court has thus far

11

gone in analyzing the performance inquiry.

12

Clearly, counsel has to be selective in raising

13

the issues that it chooses to present to an appellate

14

court especially, and clearly, as this Court stated in

15

Smith v. Robbins last term, just because a claim might

16

look good in hindsight doesn't mean that it's the kind of

17

claim that counsel should be deemed obligated to have

18

raised.

19

But there is a unique feature to the sentencing

20

guidelines claims, as well as a generally relevant point

21

to appellate advocacy that I think the Court could do well

22

to clarify.

23

can often be ambiguity about whether a particular claim

24

will indeed help the defendant when it is raised on appeal

25

and prevails and, if so, by how much.

In these sentencing guidelines claims, there

19

1

In this case, most starkly, our view is that if

2

petitioner got the grouping that he asked for, his offense

3

level should actually go up, not down, because the

4

grouping would have required that all of the financial

5

harm that he inflicted on the various victims be

6

aggregated into one group, so a counsel who was looking at

7

a sentencing guidelines claim, unlike claims that would

8

simply result in a reversal of a conviction, has to be

9

cognizant that there can be unintended adverse effects.

10

In addition, and this was the insight that I

11

think the Seventh Circuit was most concerned with,

12

sentencing guidelines claims can produce sometimes only

13

very modest benefits, and the length of the benefit that

14

would be produced is a relevant factor in considering

15

whether reasonable counsel would elect to raise a

16

relatively long-shot claim, or a claim that's not

17

established.

18

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Dreeben, I take it we have

19

three choices here.

We could say something on this issue

20

that helps the Government.

21

could say something that hurts the Government.

22

rather us have us say nothing than say something that

23

hurts the Government, I take it.

24

MR. DREEBEN:

25

(Laughter.)

We could say nothing.

We

You would

Correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

20

1

MR. DREEBEN:

I'm here seeking to affirm the

2

judgment, and if I can't affirm the judgment, at least get

3

some guidance that would be useful to the lower courts

4

that have been grappling with this problem.

5

Now, petitioner has, of course, pointed out that

6

it is unusual for the Court to go beyond the scope of the

7

question presented and address grounds that were not

8

decided below and the Government, of course, fully agrees

9

with that.

We recognize that it's unusual.

It's

10

certainly not unprecedented for the Court to decide a case

11

on grounds that weren't decided by the lower court or that

12

were not fully addressed.

13

QUESTION:

If I understand you correctly, you're

14

asking us either to affirm on grounds not relied on below

15

or, alternatively, to write an advisory opinion on the

16

general subject matter.

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. DREEBEN:

19

I would call it giving guidance,

Mr. Justice Stevens.

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. DREEBEN:

The Court similarly believed that

22

it was appropriate to give guidance to the lower courts by

23

showing how the rule of law applies to the particular

24

facts in Brook Group v. Brown & Williamson, a 1993

25

decision where the Court took a novel antitrust principle
21

1

and then applied it to the very intricate and specific

2

facts of that case.

3

In Siegert v. Gilley, a 1991 decision, the Court

4

actually affirmed the judgment on a ground that the lower

5

court had not reached at all.

6

said there was a heightened pleading requirement for

7

qualified immunity.

8

grounds that there was no underlying constitutional right

9

that was asserted in the Bivens action at all, and in that

10

case not only was that not the question presented, but the

11

parties hadn't even briefed it or addressed it.

12

QUESTION:

There, the lower court had

This Court decided the case on the

So --

There's -- on occasion -- I -- it

13

seems to me that case -- opinion perhaps represents a

14

decision that a particular claim is logically antecedent

15

to another one, and it seems to me you have a hard time

16

saying that here.

17

MR. DREEBEN:

I do have a hard time saying it's

18

logically antecedent, but the third case that I would

19

refer the Court to involves the elaboration of the

20

additional implications of a claim that the court decided.

21

That is Colstad v. American Dental Association, which was

22

decided in 1999, and there the Court elaborated a standard

23

for punitive damages in Title VII actions and then went on

24

to give guidance to the lower courts about how agency

25

principles apply, but then remanded -22

1

QUESTION:

And some members of the Court were

2

rather critical of that particular development, I would

3

say.

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. DREEBEN:

6
7

I am relying on the majority's

disposition in the case.
QUESTION:

Your brief was very effective on the

8

points you're raising.

9

MR. DREEBEN:

The Seventh Circuit obviously

10

could resolve these issues, and if this Court chooses to

11

give the guidance that we think is appropriate, it will

12

help the overall administration of the judicial system,

13

because we believe, on the one hand, that when a defendant

14

has not had adequate assistance of counsel,

15

constitutionally effective assistance of counsel in

16

litigating the sentencing guidelines claims, and he can

17

show a reasonable probability of a different outcome, then

18

he has satisfied the elements of a constitutional claim.

19

QUESTION:

Okay, so what you want us to say is,

20

we assume for argument's sake that the present defendant's

21

present interpretation of how this all works, the multiple

22

count thing is correct.

23

we'd have to get into who's right and who's wrong about

24

multiple counts, wouldn't we?

25

MR. DREEBEN:

We'd have to say that, otherwise

I think -23

1
2

QUESTION:

We'd have to say, we assume they're

right, I think.

3

MR. DREEBEN:

4

QUESTION:

I think that the Court could --

Or do you want us to get into

5

multiple counts, which is -- I know multiple counts.

6

like Hagel on his death bed.

7

ever understood me, and even he didn't understand me.

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. DREEBEN:

10
11
12
13

It's

He said, only one person has

That's perhaps why the Sentencing

Commission is going to clarify this.
I think it's also perhaps why counsel should not
be quickly branded ineffective.
QUESTION:

All right, so you want us to say, we

14

assume for argument's sake that they're right on the

15

merits of multiple counts, a thing you don't really

16

believe, but you want us to say that they're right, for

17

assumption.

18

MR. DREEBEN:

No.

I actually would like the

19

Court to say that the Seventh Circuit applied the

20

incorrect test for prejudice, but a properly analyzed

21

performance and prejudice inquiry would produce the

22

conclusion that petitioner's counsel is wrong.

23

be my first choice.

24
25

That would

My second choice is for the Court to do no harm
to the arguments that I'm making about ineffective
24

1

assistance, and that those are really the only two choices

2

that I'd like to submit to the Court at present.

3

(Laughter.)

4

QUESTION:

Is there any difference in the legal

5

standard applied to a performance by retained counsel as

6

opposed to appointed counsel for ineffective assistance of

7

counsel purposes?

8
9

MR. DREEBEN:

No, Mr. Chief Justice.

There is a

constitutional floor that applies regardless of whether

10

counsel is retained or appointed.

11

there's a different standard is where counsel is waived

12

altogether and the defendant represents himself.

13

then not charge himself with ineffective assistance of

14

counsel.

15

The only place where

He can

There is one legal point that has not been

16

clarified in this Court's cases regarding appellate

17

assistance by counsel that could also be usefully

18

clarified, and that is that we think the proper inquiry

19

would look to the state of the law facing appellate

20

counsel, rather than having an evidentiary hearing that

21

would analyze in great depth how much legal research the

22

particular counsel did in anticipation of filing his

23

appellate brief.

24
25

The inquiries here are essentially whether the
defendant's lawyer did not present a claim that was
25

1

sufficiently strong that it was ineffective for him not to

2

present it.

3

that should be measured by the state of the law that was

4

confronting the appellate counsel at the time, and should

5

be resolved based on the legal precedents that are in

6

existence.

7

We think that that is an objective inquiry

QUESTION:

But isn't the suggestion here that

8

sometime between the oral argument in the Seventh Circuit

9

and the Seventh Circuit's decision this intervening

10

decision in Wilson came down, so that any competent

11

counsel would have said to the Seventh Circuit, may I file

12

a supplement including this decision, which bears very

13

much on a case that is sub judica before you.

14

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think the answer is no,

15

for several reasons, Justice Ginsburg.

16

there's no authority that I know of that says that

17

competent counsel is required to continue to survey the

18

developing law on issues that he decided not to raise to

19

appeal to an appellate court to determine whether there

20

has been some change of law on an issue that he abandoned.

21

I don't think that competent counsel is required to stay

22

abreast of the law in that fashion.

23

First of all

Second, as we have pointed out, competent

24

counsel may well conclude that, rather than risking the

25

ire of the court of appeals by raising a claim that he had
26

1

previously abandoned and is now exploiting only because

2

some other defendant had successfully raised it might cost

3

him credibility with the court of appeals and is therefore

4

not appropriately done.

5

There was no authority in the Seventh Circuit at

6

the time, as there is today, that says that counsel has a

7

right to present new issues that are based on intervening

8

law.

9

QUESTION:

Do we know what the Seventh Circuit

10

practice is?

11

briefs based on intervening changes in the law?

12

Does it generally receive such supplemental

MR. DREEBEN:

I have spoken to the U.S.

13

Attorney's Office about that question and I have not

14

received a clear answer, because it doesn't come up all

15

that often, but I will say that the Seventh Circuit is a

16

procedurally strict circuit and it does make every effort

17

to ensure that parties get review only on those issues

18

that they've elected to raise in their opening brief.

19

Now, there is one piece of stray dictum in a

20

Seventh Circuit case that suggests that, of course, if the

21

law changes, maybe parties can raise new issues.

22

circuits are divided on that issue, so it's hardly

23

something that I think competent counsel should be

24

presumed required to do in order to meet the minimal

25

constitutional standard of adequacy.
27

Other

1

And the final reason why in this case I don't

2

think competent counsel was deficient even if he knew

3

about Wilson and didn't raise it to the court of appeals

4

is because Wilson, under its grouping analysis, produces

5

this strange anomaly of requiring more financial harm to

6

be included in each of the offenses that is grouped, and

7

for reasons that as Justice Breyer has pointed out, very

8

few people understand but we've attempted to lay out in

9

our brief, the offense level would actually go up, and it

10
11

would have a counterintuitive result.
This actually happened in the Wilson case.

The

12

judge on remand from Wilson I, the case that petitioner

13

says should have been cited to the panel, resentenced the

14

defendant to a higher sentence, faithfully applying the

15

guidelines as he understood them.

16

then reversed, saying, well, the Government had waived its

17

right to argue the increased offense level in that manner.

18

We don't agree with the Seventh Circuit's waiver

The court of appeals

19

analysis, but the more salient point here is that no

20

counsel could have foreseen that the Seventh Circuit would

21

later apply a waiver analysis, and thus, if counsel had

22

actually read the Seventh Circuit's decision and said

23

grouping is required under subsection (d) of the

24

sentencing guidelines, section 3(d)1.2, and had asked for

25

that, the sentence could go up, and that lawyer would not
28

1

be assured that there would be any purpose served by

2

raising that kind of an argument only to his client's

3

ultimate detriment.

4

So taking into account the complexities of the

5

guidelines, the potential for adverse results that can

6

occur, and the state of the law which hardly suggested

7

that this was, as Judge Easterbrook has called in another

8

context, a dead-bang winner on appeal, we don't think that

9

there was any deficient performance by petitioner's

10

counsel that would merit ineffective assistance relief on

11

collateral review.

12

If the Court has no further questions --
