ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK MEIERHENRY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. MEIERHENRY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, Ms. Brinkmann:

11

This case comes to you out of the State of South

12

Dakota, and I'd like to briefly put the setting for all of

13

you.

14

This is from Yankton, South Dakota, which was

15

the first territorial capital of the Dakota Territory.

16

a result of that, certain institutions were created, one

17

of which was Yankton College.

18

in the Dakotas and Montana.

19

in the 1980's, and it's now a Federal prison camp.

20

Federal prison camp has no walls.

21

College did for over a century until it was closed.

22

As

It was the oldest college
It's now closed.

It closed
That

It looks like Yankton

At that place resides today Chris Lopez.

Chris

23

Lopez came to the Yankton prison camp from the State of

24

Iowa.

25

to do so by the district court to self-report to this

He drove across the State of Iowa and was allowed

3

1

college campus, now Federal prison camp.

2

We're here today to talk about 18 U.S.C.

3

3621(e).

That statute at the time that Chris Lopez was a

4

convicted person, before he was a prisoner, unambiguously

5

grants to him an incentive, and before he knocked on the

6

door to be let into prison it said to him, if you are a

7

drug abuser, which he admits he is, and if you agree to

8

undergo the program, which he does, if you've been

9

convicted of a nonviolent offense, Congress has made a

10

deal with you.

11

complete the program, to be let out of prison up to 1 year

12

early.

13

We will allow you, if you successfully

He had 72 months to serve.
QUESTION:

But counsel, that's not what the

14

statute says.

The statute says the Bureau of Prisons may

15

reduce the sentence up to 1 year.

16

a right or an entitlement, does it?

17

MR. MEIERHENRY:

No.

It doesn't say you have

I don't urge this Court

18

that that is the case, that it's an entitlement.

19

legislative history is clear that that was considered by

20

Congress, and Congress did not wish to make it a right

21

that if you simply go through the program yet you led the

22

gang on the campus, or you created other disciplinary

23

problems, that the Bureau of Prisons shouldn't have

24

control over the prisoner while that prisoner was

25

incarcerated, but this is something I'd like -4

The

1

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

You're saying that it --

2

that -- I mean, that doesn't go far enough.

3

acknowledging is that the Bureau of Prisons didn't have to

4

give you that benefit unless you successfully completed

5

the program, right?

6

MR. MEIERHENRY:

7

QUESTION:

All you're

That's correct.

But you're still maintaining that if

8

you successfully complete the program, if you're a model

9

prisoner and everything else, you had a right to get that

10

benefit?

11

MR. MEIERHENRY:

12

next case.

13

Chris --

Justice, I think that's the

What we're here arguing today is whether

14

QUESTION:

Well, what does the statute say?

15

QUESTION:

It says may.

16

MR. MEIERHENRY:

The statute says may, but let's

17

consider the structure of it.

3621(a) is very clear.

18

3621(a) tells the Bureau of Prisons that they may not

19

release a prisoner until the expiration of the term

20

imposed, or there's a good conduct section 3624, so when

21

(e) was enacted -- and the legislative history is Congress

22

also amended section 3621(b), which says the bureau shall

23

make available appropriate substance abuse treatment for

24

each prisoner the bureau determines has a treatable

25

condition of substance addiction or abuse.
5

All right,

1

they enact that.

2

But 3621(a) would not allow anyone to be

3

released early, so they enacted subsection (c), which is

4

entitled, substance abuse treatment, so section (e), Your

5

Honors, had to be amended to give permission to the Bureau

6

of Prisons that if people took the substance abuse

7

treatment there would be some incentive.

8

congressional hearings are clear.

9

QUESTION:

The

Well, you're talking about

10

legislative history, Mr. Meierhenry, and those of us who

11

resort to legislative history usually do so only where

12

something is ambiguous.

13

here in section (b), and what is ambiguous about the word

14

may?

15

MR. MEIERHENRY:

We're dealing with the word may

I don't think there's anything

16

necessarily ambiguous if you use another meaning of the

17

word, give permission to.

18

the enactment of (e), if you had substance abuse

19

treatment, if you had an incentive, the Bureau of Prisons

20

could not turn anyone loose under any circumstances.

21

I urge Your Honor that until

What I am urging is a plain reading of this.

22

Before Mr. Lopez, so to speak, becomes a prisoner, as you

23

read this you would -- it would indicate that if you're a

24

substance abuse user and you go through the program and

25

you substantially complete it -- in other words, obey the
6

1

rules within the institution.

2

QUESTION:

3

And you may -- your sentence may be

reduced.

4

MR. MEIERHENRY:

5

QUESTION:

Right, but --

See, you've got to deal with that

6

word may, Mr. Meierhenry.

7

will be reduced.

8

MR. MEIERHENRY:

You're speaking as if it said

No, I'm -- what happened in

9

this case, Your Honor, was that Chris Lopez, before he

10

ever walked in the institution, has been categorically

11

eliminated because he has a sentence enhancement for

12

preconviction activity.

13

because of something that did not occur under the --

14

QUESTION:

He is categorically denied

But that -- that may be a perfectly

15

good argument, but it -- and it seems to me it takes

16

cognizance of the word may, that Congress has already

17

decided the categories of sentences, but I don't think

18

just bobbing and weaving around the word may does your

19

argument any good.

20
21

MR. MEIERHENRY:

Well, maybe I'm not being clear

that --

22

QUESTION:

You're not --

23

MR. MEIERHENRY:

That the Congress gave to the

24

Bureau of Prisons certain discretion, and that discretion

25

is over prisoners, not over creating categories of
7

1

prisoners.

2

Now, this is not a case where my client has any

3

opportunity to successfully complete for purposes of the

4

incentive the program.

5

To use an analogy, this statute clearly says if you go to

6

drug class, and the class --

7

QUESTION:

8

May I interrupt you?

He's not shut

out of the program, is he?

9
10

He's been shut out of the program.

MR. MEIERHENRY:

No.

No, and I don't want to

mislead the Court.

11

QUESTION:

Okay.

12

MR. MEIERHENRY:

He's not shut out of the

13

program.

14

incentive, obviously, we're talking about here.

15

prisoners, Congress declared -- that's part of our

16

argument.

17

prisoners by 1997 should have access to a drug treatment

18

program.

19

It's the incentive.

If I infer that -- it's the
All

Congress declared that 100 percent of all

QUESTION:

Mr. Meierhenry, how do you propose

20

that the Bureau of Prisons implement the may?

21

want them to use categories like, all prisoners who have

22

engaged in violent behavior in prison.

23

category?

24

MR. MEIERHENRY:

25

QUESTION:

You don't

Isn't that a

Yes, but it's --

All prisoners whom we do not believe
8

1

will be safe to let out on the streets even after the

2

program, isn't that a category?

3

you're being rational, if you're trying not to be

4

arbitrary, you establish categories, so your argument that

5

may cannot mean you establish categories just leaves me

6

cold.

7

It seems to me that if

It seems to me that that's exactly what you want

8

the Bureau of Prisons to do, to be responsible, not to

9

just arbitrarily say, yeah, you get it, you don't get it.

10

That's arbitrary.

11

tried to establish a rational scheme.

12

with that?

13

That's irrational.

MR. MEIERHENRY:

But here they've
What's the matter

Well, I could argue about,

14

which I think is the next case, of whether it's rational

15

to consider Mr. Lopez is a violent person when they put

16

him in a --

17

QUESTION:

Oh, I didn't think they were

18

considering him as a violent person.

19

considering him as a person who had committed his crime

20

while, I guess, carrying a gun.

21

MR. MEIERHENRY:

22

QUESTION:

I thought they were

He had --

I didn't under -- maybe I

23

misunderstand the Government, because I didn't think the

24

Government was saying that that qualified him as a violent

25

person, because if that were the case we wouldn't be
9

1

talking about any discretionary category.

2

MR. MEIERHENRY:

No, that's correct, and we've

3

been through that litigation history of them defining a

4

nonviolent offense as a violent offense, which was the

5

Eighth Circuit case of Martin v. Gerlinski,

6

answer to the problem, the problem is one of who gets in

7

the classroom.

8

Congress told the Bureau of Prisons who gets in the

9

classroom -- all --

10

QUESTION:

but the

Our argument today is very simple.

Well, everybody gets in the

11

classroom.

The question is, having been -- not who is

12

eligible for the program, but who is eligible for the

13

early release afterwards.

14

Stevens, there's no exclusion from the drug treatment

15

program.

16

MR. MEIERHENRY:

17

QUESTION:

As you've said to Justice

That's correct.

And the reason there's no exclusion

18

from the program is that it says that the bureau shall

19

establish the program.

20

really -- it just jumps out at you, is that it keeps using

21

shall.

22

of custody section, and there all of a sudden it shifts

23

from shall to may, which means discretion.

24
25

If you read through 3621, what is

Shall, shall, shall, until it gets to the period

MR. MEIERHENRY:

It means discretion, but it is

not a grant of discretion to categorically deny nonviolent
10

1

offenders consideration for the reduction.

2

QUESTION:

May I clarify two things?

If you are

3

now leaving your argument that all people who complete the

4

program successfully and are nonviolent offenders must be

5

given this reduction, if you are leaving that, and

6

shifting to an each individual is entitled to an

7

individual determination, not a categorical exclusion, if

8

you're doing that, then mustn't the bureau do the same

9

thing for nonviolent offenders who weren't carrying any

10
11

weapon?
I mean, if it's going to be a one-by-one

12

examination for a defendant that fits in your client's

13

category, wouldn't it also be one-by-one for anyone?

14

MR. MEIERHENRY:

It could be.

I don't have a

15

definitive answer of how to run the Bureau of Prisons,

16

except I'm here saying that this statute clearly tells the

17

Bureau of Prisons how people are to get into the program

18

for the purposes of the incentive, and that is all

19

nonviolent offenders are to be considered, and that's to

20

occur after successfully completing the program.

21

they've made that decision.

22

QUESTION:

Here

Well, could they make a decision

23

categorically that all people who are nonviolent offenders

24

who aren't carrying a firearm will get the reduction?

25

MR. MEIERHENRY:

I think they've done that.
11

I

1

think that's the way it practically works, unless they've

2

had disciplinary problems.

3

to one report, the Triad Report, indicates that they were

4

not allowed because of disciplinary problems within the

5

institution.

6

QUESTION:

I think 13 percent, according

It seems to me your argument has got

7

to be not that there can't be categorization by the

8

bureau, but that Congress has limited the kind of

9

categorization the bureau may use, that Congress has said

10

nonviolent offenders, and the bureau can't go beyond that

11

when it's talking about limiting the availability of early

12

release.

13

MR. MEIERHENRY:

14

that is essentially what I'm saying.

15

the purposes of the incentive, that everyone starts the

16

program and everyone has the opportunity to successfully

17

complete it, and call that a category if you may, that

18

it's while they're in the institution that they may be --

19

their activities may eliminate them from this category.

20

It's not something that occurred at the time of

21

sentencing, which was preconviction activity.

22

QUESTION:

Chief Justice, that -- I guess
I'm saying that for

You're saying that the only

23

precondition category that the bureau can use is the

24

precondition category which is set forth in the statute,

25

and which implicitly excludes other pre-imprisonment
12

1

categories, namely, violent offender.

2

MR. MEIERHENRY:

Well, there are two categories

3

when Chris -- before Chris -- when Chris Lopez is an

4

offender.

5

considered that the BOP's definition of that.

6

It's violent, and nonviolent.

The courts have

When he hits prison there are two categories,

7

violent and nonviolent, and my argument is that all of

8

those activities have been considered by Congress, have

9

been determined by Congress, and they wanted to broaden

10
11
12
13

the program.
QUESTION:

Then why didn't they use the word

shall, rather than the word may?
MR. MEIERHENRY:

Because I don't think they

14

wanted -- Congress wanted to create a right that just

15

based on completion of the program, without regard to

16

their other activities as a prisoner, that just the

17

completion of that program meant you were entitled to --

18

and I think that's the word, entitled to reduction.

19

QUESTION:

You say you don't think that.

I

20

mean, is there something in the legislative history that

21

specifically supports that argument?

22

MR. MEIERHENRY:

Other than that it was clear,

23

and I refer to the legislative history, the report.

24

clear from the legislative history that Congress said that

25

this subparagraph we're discussing, they use the word
13

It's

1

authorizes the Bureau of Prisons to shorten by up to 1

2

year the term of a prisoner who successfully completed a

3

treatment program.

4
5
6

QUESTION:

They saw it as an authorization -Yes, but authorization is not

equivalent to mandate.
MR. MEIERHENRY:

But the converse is also true.

7

Authorization is not a grant of power to create categories

8

which overrule the two made by Congress, violent and

9

nonviolent.

10

QUESTION:

Well, you know, your argument that it

11

relates only to -- your argument would be a lot stronger

12

if the section, the relevant section, 2(b), didn't have

13

the word successfully in it.

14

I could understand Congress saying the Bureau of

15

Prisons may cut a year off the term of somebody who

16

completes the program.

17

bureau can, you know, can decide for itself whether this

18

fellow, although he completed the program, has really been

19

cured or not, or, you know, factors like that, but it

20

doesn't say that.

21

has successfully treated -- completed the program.

22

Then you could say, well, the

It says, it may release somebody who

Now, what factors do you think the may was

23

intended to let the Bureau of Prisons take into account?

24

It isn't completion of the program.

25

successfully he completed it, he still is not entitled to
14

No matter how

1

it.

Now, what could disable him from the year, other than

2

killing another inmate while he's in there?

3

MR. MEIERHENRY:

I think the traditional

4

standards that are applied to good time clearly are going

5

to be the type of criteria for good time release under

6

section 36 -- 18 U.S.C. 3624, would obviously still be

7

used.

8
9

I mean, you have good-time release, which is the
only other way you can get out -- basically you can get

10

out of prison early.

11

legislation.

12

That was not affected by this

They added an incentive up to a year.

I think you've got to wed those two together,

13

and I think that's the discretion that the Bureau of

14

Prisons has and must have, not to create defining

15

categories of exclusion before they start, but you can

16

eliminate the good time type criteria that the Bureau of

17

Prisons is familiar with, and it would appear from

18

Congress, Congress recognized that this must be a

19

long-term program, 6 to 12 months, that it was not easy,

20

and they said the committee believes that such an

21

incentive is necessary to draw into treatment many inmates

22

who may not be willing to undergo a difficult program

23

otherwise.

24
25

They recognize that there's an 800-percent
greater chance of a drug-addicted person committing a
15

1

future crime, and Congress --

2

QUESTION:

May I ask how you would -- the

3

statute in your view would have meant anything different

4

if the word may had been replaced by the word shall or

5

must?

6

MR. MEIERHENRY:

I think then, successful

7

completion.

A prisoner would have said, I successfully

8

completed this program, I must be allocated up to a year,

9

some period of time off.

It is a right of mine, it is a

10

handshake Congress made with me, and I must be given it,

11

even though I violated every criteria for good-time

12

release, this and this alone --

13

QUESTION:

What are those criteria?

14

MR. MEIERHENRY:

Well, obviously, obeying the

15

rules of the institution, not having contraband, you know,

16

those type of --

17
18
19

QUESTION:

Because if you had contraband you

would not have successfully completed this program.
MR. MEIERHENRY:

Exactly.

That's the discretion

20

that obviously Congress had to give to them, because part

21

of successful completion of a program is to obey the rules

22

of the institution as well.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Then it should have used shall.

it should have used shall.
MR. MEIERHENRY:

Well, but if you use -16

Then

1

QUESTION:

Because they could have said, you

2

shall release him if he successfully completed the

3

program, and you say that successfully completion of the

4

program includes obeying all the rules in the institution.

5
6

MR. MEIERHENRY:
sense --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. MEIERHENRY:

9

Well, maybe I misspoke in this

things.

You certainly did.
Because those are two different

I mean, successful completion of the program --

10

let me use my analogy of the classroom, all right.

11

A student's in the classroom.

It's clear the

12

student has power over the student in the classroom,

13

whether they complete the program, whether they obey,

14

they're in charge of grading, correct, and here the Bureau

15

of Prisons has that.

16

control over is which students enter the school.

17

case, that's Congress.

18

of incentive, everybody with a nonviolent offense has a

19

right to be a student and pass the course.

20

But what the teacher does not have
In this

Congress has said, for the purpose

Now, here the Bureau of Prisons says, well, all

21

nonviolent offenders, yes, get to take the course, but

22

we've already said you kids in this row, you people in

23

this row will, even if you successfully do everything

24

correctly, you don't qualify, not based on what Congress

25

said -17

1

QUESTION:

Yes, but supposing you had a rule

2

that said, but there's a category of students who would

3

normally get a gold star but if they threw an eraser at

4

the teacher, they shall not get the gold star, and

5

supposing you have here a program that said, you are

6

entitled to the year, but if you have taken a poke at the

7

warden you shall not be released.

8
9

They just have a category, anybody who takes a
poke at the warden, even though he's successfully

10

completed the program, shall not get the 1-year benefit.

11

Would that categorical denial be consistent with the

12

statute, in your view?

13

MR. MEIERHENRY:

I think that is consistent,

14

because it is activities in the prison over which the

15

bureau --

16

QUESTION:

So it isn't the mere fact that it is

17

a category.

18

pre-incarceration category, it's bad.

19

Your position is that if it's a

That's correct.

20

care of that.

21

administration to the Bureau of Prisons.

22

Congress took

It created the two categories and left the

The Bureau of Prisons here has created

23

additional -- numerous additional categories.

24

client's case, a nonviolent offender drug case with a

25

sentence enhancement for possession of a firearm.
18

In my

They've

1
2

created these categories in advance.
I'm not arguing that the Bureau of Prisons

3

doesn't have discretion over its institution.

4

the statute clearly says.

5

QUESTION:

That's what

And they can exercise that discretion

6

by creating categories as long as the categories are

7

directed at postincarceration conduct.

8
9
10
11

MR. MEIERHENRY:

To the activities of the

prisoner while they're in prison, not to preconviction
activities.
QUESTION:

It's a very sensible and logical

12

theory, but what in the statute or the legislative history

13

identifies that particular theory?

14

MR. MEIERHENRY:

Nothing specifically identifies

15

it that way as opposed to my colleague's way.

16

is rational, it is something that makes sense, it is

17

something that when you --

18

QUESTION:

It's more than that.

To me, it

I thought -- I

19

mean, come on, you're -- you'll have to give us some text

20

to hang on to.

21

I assume that what your argument is, is the

22

familiar argument, inclusio unius exclusio alterius, that

23

in fact the statute does identify one pre-incarceration

24

factor that will disqualify you from obtaining the year's

25

benefit, and that pre-incarceration factor is conviction
19

1

of a violent crime, and by adding another pre-

2

incarceration factor, namely just merely possessing a

3

firearm, you're contradicting the implicit exclusion of

4

other pre-incarceration factors.

5

argument?

You're relying --

6

MR. MEIERHENRY:

7

QUESTION:

8

Well --

-- upon the fact that a violent

offender is explicitly excluded.

9
10

Isn't that your

MR. MEIERHENRY:

Our argument is clearly this is

an unambiguous statute.

11

QUESTION:

Well now, you -- but Justice Scalia

12

asked you a particular question.

13

your argument, and I think you --

14

MR. MEIERHENRY:

Is that or is that not

Well, it is my argument.

15

what I was going to say, first we believe it's

16

unambiguous, but if you get into the determination --

I --

17
18

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

Why is it unambiguous?

don't understand what you mean by, it's unambiguous.

I

19

MR. MEIERHENRY:

Well, because of the way they

20

constructed this.

First of all, subsection (e) on

21

substance abuse had never been the law of the land until

22

Congress identified that this was a serious problem.

23

Okay.

24

which they do.

25

treat 100 percent, or make available 100 percent all

So they've got to enact substance abuse treatment,
They require the Bureau of Prisons to

20

1
2

prisoners.
Then they recognize, this is a tough program,

3

let's give an incentive.

4

prisoners, then it was -- the Senate created two

5

categories, violent and nonviolent.

6

At first it was to all

Then it came down to substance abuse treatment.

7

They added the incentive that said -- and they couldn't

8

give them any time off up until the passage of part B,

9

period of custody, and they created two categories,

10

violent, nonviolent, and they said to the Bureau of

11

Prisons, as we have given you the discretion over the

12

years on good-time decisions, we give you that discretion

13

as well in determining who successfully completes a

14

treatment program, but we don't want to go the next step

15

and make it a right of release.

16

for successfully completing the program.

17

We want the discretion

So the common sense reading appears to be, you

18

don't have to, you can take into other considerations, but

19

nothing in that step-by-step process said, Bureau of

20

Prisons, you may create additional categories that

21

categorically exclude prisoners based on preconditions.

22
23

QUESTION:

So your answer to Justice Scalia's

question is basically yes.

24

MR. MEIERHENRY:

25

QUESTION:

Is that correct?
Yes.

If the Bureau of Prisons had a
21

1

categorical rule that extreme recidivists, someone who had

2

been convicted four times, has been in and out of prison,

3

that four-time offenders will not be released early, would

4

that be impermissible?

5

MR. MEIERHENRY:

I believe so, and I'm assuming

6

your question is nonviolent --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. MEIERHENRY:

9

Yes.
-- for nonviolent offenses.

think that's correct, that Congress considered that.

10

may not like it, the Court may not like it.

11

Bureau of Prisons doesn't like it.

12

QUESTION:

I
We

Clearly the

So -- but essentially your argument

13

then comes down to the may means shall.

14

any difference if the word shall had been used, or must,

15

that in this context may means shall or must.

16

MR. MEIERHENRY:

It wouldn't make

It would mean that again the

17

door -- in this case, there is no door to the prison wall,

18

but it would make the difference between the natural

19

discretion the Bureau of Prisons has over the activities

20

of the prisoners inside, as opposed to their activities

21

that occurred when they were just --

22

QUESTION:

So your answer is no.

You don't want

23

us to read may to be shall.

You want us to read may to

24

mean may, but that the scope of the discretion only

25

excludes -- only includes matters other than pre22

1

incarceration convictions, at least, right?

2

MR. MEIERHENRY:

Correct.

My argument is simply

3

that Congress created the excluding category, and that was

4

a violent offense, that the BOP, having created additional

5

excluding -- not based on any activity in the prison,

6

excluding categories, nothing in this act, legislative

7

history, or the purpose of this, supports reducing the

8

number of prisoners available for the incentive.

9

the opposite.

It was an inclusive statute.

10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

12

Thank you,

Mr. Meierhenry.

13

Ms. Brinkmann, we'll hear from you.

14

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BETH S. BRINKMANN

15

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

16
17

It is

MS. BRINKMANN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

18

The issue in this case is whether the Bureau of

19

Prisons permissibly exercised its discretion under section

20

3621(e)(2)(B) as reflected in its regulation and program

21

statement.

22

QUESTION:

Ms. Brinkmann, I take it that

23

discretion was exercised in the regulation adopted by the

24

Bureau of Prisons.

25

MS. BRINKMANN:

The regulation and program
23

1

statement that the Bureau of Prisons promulgated was a

2

statement of policy of how the Bureau of Prisons will

3

exercise its discretion.

4

QUESTION:

I notice that in an amicus brief it's

5

argued that the regulation was promulgated without

6

following the notice and comment requirements of the

7

Administrative Procedure Act, but I gather that issue was

8

not developed below and is not here.

9

MS. BRINKMANN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

It

10

wasn't raised below nor in this Court, nor did the court

11

below address it and, in fact, our understanding is that

12

no court of appeals has addressed that argument, but we do

13

believe, as we explain in a footnote in our brief, that it

14

is not subject to the notice and comment requirement.

15

It could go into effect as an interim

16

regulation, because it is a statement of policy, the way

17

in which the Bureau of Prisons will implement the statute,

18

and then in each case there is a determination of whether

19

a particular prisoner will be granted early release.

20

QUESTION:

Are there any other instances of

21

statutes -- are there any instances of statutes where the

22

Bureau of Prisons is explicitly authorized to make

23

distinctions and decisions based on preconviction conduct?

24
25

MS. BRINKMANN:

Yes, Your Honor, many.

In fact,

the good conduct time statute that we -- Mr. Meierhenry
24

1

was discussing is in a neighboring provision.

2

section 3624.

3

granting good conduct time, and there are two different

4

standards, and they're dependent on whether or not the

5

prisoner was convicted of a crime of violence, and in fact

6

this program statement also applies to that statute,

7

although there's no discretionary determination, so the

8

crime of violence is determined by the statutory

9

definition.

10

It's in

It talks about the Bureau of Prisons

QUESTION:

Well, do you think the bureau could

11

switch back and forth under that section that you just

12

referred to and say, although Congress said all nonviolent

13

people should be treated this way, we think some of these

14

should be treated the way violent people are?

15
16
17

MS. BRINKMANN:

No, Your Honor.

We believe that

that is a determination that Congress has made.
QUESTION:

Why isn't the same true here, that

18

Congress has said nonviolent offenders shall be eligible

19

for this, and the Bureau of Prisons has said categorically

20

some nonviolent offenders will not be eligible?

21

MS. BRINKMANN:

Because of the broad grant of

22

discretion given the Bureau of Prisons by the express

23

statutory language, Congress using the term may.

24

nothing in the statutory text to suggest that the

25

statutory eligibility requirements that Congress set,
25

There's

1

which are two, conviction of a nonviolent offense and

2

successful completion of the program, in any way then

3

eliminate the ability of the Bureau of Prisons to consider

4

other factors in making their determination.

5

QUESTION:

Suppose the bureau says, we're not

6

going to release in 1 year anyone guilty of a hate crime,

7

violent or not, we don't like people who commit hate

8

crimes, could they say that?

9

MS. BRINKMANN:

Yes, Your Honor.

We think that

10

would be subject to an arbitrary and capricious review,

11

but very --

12

QUESTION:

Or offenses, you know, against the

13

United States Treasury.

14

it's one thing, you know, harming other private citizens,

15

but boy, it really gets us mad when you steal something

16

from the U.S. Treasury, so you're not going to be eligible

17

for 1 year.

18

MS. BRINKMANN:

It really gets us mad.

Yes, Your Honor.

I mean,

It would be

19

subject to arbitrary and capricious review.

It's very

20

similar to the situation before the Court in the case of

21

INS v. Yang.

22

deportation for persons who committed --

That was a situation involving a waiver of

23

QUESTION:

Right.

24

MS. BRINKMANN:

25

QUESTION:

-- fraud at entry.

Why is a firearm use not arbitrary
26

1

and capricious, but -- and hate crime, is that arbitrary

2

and capricious, or not?

3
4

MS. BRINKMANN:

We think within the broad

expertise of the Bureau of Prisons and --

QUESTION:

MS. BRINKMANN:

QUESTION:

8

You say that's okay?

is not okay.

9

That's okay.
If the --

Treasury, stealing from the Treasury

That's arbitrary and capricious.

MS. BRINKMANN:

Why?

We -- I don't believe it would

10

be arbitrary and capricious.

11

QUESTION:

12

MS. BRINKMANN:

13

QUESTION:

14

MS. BRINKMANN:

Oh.
I think that --

So all of those are okay.
They very well may be, Your

15

Honor.

They would only be subject to arbitrary and

16

capricious to determine if there was some lack of total

17

penalogical reason for that.

18

QUESTION:

Well, but isn't this argument

19

available to just that point, that it is perfectly clear

20

from the legislative history that the object of allowing

21

the 1-year reduction is to provide an incentive without

22

which the drug treatment program could not be expected to

23

work.

24
25

I gather it's a difficult thing, and there just
isn't enough inducement for somebody to force himself
27

1

through this unless there really is going to be a

2

substantial reward, and it seems odd to me that if that is

3

the object, that Congress would have wanted, for example,

4

to exclude the entire class of gun carriers who are

5

obviously much more dangerous gun carriers, I assume, when

6

they're under the influence of drugs, from the inducement

7

that would lead, if the statistics are correct, to a

8

reduction in the number of drug-using gun-carriers.

9

would they exclude the inducement from all of these

10
11

Why

serious categories?
MS. BRINKMANN:

Several answers, Your Honor.

12

First of all, there is a significant participation in the

13

substance abuse treatment program of those who are not

14

eligible for early release.

15

prisoners that participate in this program --

16

QUESTION:

More than one-third of the

Well, that may be, but the concern of

17

the Congress was that we need an inducement to make our

18

program effective.

19

would they exclude such large categories, or entire

20

categories of offenders from that inducement?

21

Why -- if that is their premise, why

MS. BRINKMANN:

Congress' determination was that

22

they would give the Bureau of Prisons the authority to

23

grant that kind of incentive because, as Mr. Meierhenry

24

said, otherwise the bureau --

25

QUESTION:

Well, that's the conclusion, but in
28

1

providing authority, why would they want to give the

2

Bureau of Prisons the authority to exclude entire

3

categories from an inducement which they thought was

4

necessary to make the program work?

5

MS. BRINKMANN:

The legislative history does not

6

support the proposition that the incentive is necessary

7

for participation.

8

but what Congress did was give that authority to the

9

Bureau of Prisons consistent with its repeated grant to

Certainly it enhances participation,

10

the Bureau of Prisons of broad authority in recognition of

11

the bureau's expertise --

12

QUESTION:

Okay.

13

MS. BRINKMANN:

14

QUESTION:

-- in penalogical matters.

May I interrupt?

Help me out on the

15

facts, then.

16

in the legislative history that there was a distinct

17

difference between the expected successful completion rate

18

with an inducement and the expected, or the actual

19

successful completion rate without an inducement.

20

I thinking, if it's not in the legislative history?

21

I had thought that there was an indication

MS. BRINKMANN:

What am

There was certainly evidence

22

that there were State prison systems that had this type of

23

incentive, and it was quite effective.

24

QUESTION:

25

brought before the Congress?

Congress --

Where was the evidence?

29

Was it

1

MS. BRINKMANN:

I believe it was in some

2

hearings, and there was some discussion in some of the

3

reports concerning some -- a program in New York, for

4

example, but Congress did not then mandate that the Bureau

5

of Prisons grant early release to everyone who

6

successfully completed the program.

7

QUESTION:

But don't you -- can we not fairly

8

infer, might we perhaps not infer, be able to infer simply

9

from the text itself --

10

MS. BRINKMANN:

11

QUESTION:

No, we don't believe --

-- that Congress thought the

12

inducement was important, and if it thought the inducement

13

was important, why would it want to preclude the

14

inducement from working in whole categories like this?

15

MS. BRINKMANN:

16

Prisons the authority to decide --

17

QUESTION:

It wanted to give the Bureau of

But that -- with respect, I don't

18

think that goes to my question.

19

it want to allow the Bureau of Prisons to eliminate this

20

inducement entirely?

21
22
23
24
25

MS. BRINKMANN:

My question is, why would

The Bureau of Prisons has not

eliminated the inducement entirely -QUESTION:

For the categories -- for the

categories.
MS. BRINKMANN:

-- only for certain categories.
30

1

For the very reason that Congress repeatedly delegates

2

authority to the Bureau of Prisons in these matters.

3

Categorizing prisoners is the bread and butter of the

4

Bureau of Prisons.

5

QUESTION:

They do it all the time.
So you're saying we've got to look

6

beyond this statute to the fact that there is a whole

7

universe of statutes in which the Bureau of Prisons is

8

given quite extraordinary discretionary powers.

9

MS. BRINKMANN:

We point to that to support the

10

clear text of the statute.

11

early release for any prisoner.

12

QUESTION:

The statute does not mandate

No, but the clear text just talks

13

about discretion.

14

of discretion in which it can operate.

15

The question is, what is the category

You emphasize the expertise of the Bureau of

16

Prisons, which it does seem to me is terribly important.

17

They're experts on how well the prisoners have done in

18

prison, but are they experts in classifying which people

19

should be eligible for this offense?

20

Why are they experts in saying, for example,

21

hate crimes should be excluded but heroin possession might

22

not, or something like that?

23

that?

24

parole suggested that the prison expertise is just about

25

what happens in prison, not what happened before.

Why are they experts in

They don't even -- the whole notion of abolishing

31

1

MS. BRINKMANN:

Your Honor, we would disagree

2

with that.

3

basis of categorizing prisoners, for example, for security

4

classifications.

5

prisoner when they are placed in the custody of the Bureau

6

of Prisons is a determination of what kind of housing that

7

person should be in.

8

is their criminal history, their past conduct --

9

The Bureau of Prisons has expertise on a daily

The first thing that happens to a

QUESTION:

The main part of that determination

But that all applies to the

10

conditions of his confinement while he's there.

11

have any expertise in determining recidivism and making

12

judgments accordingly?

13
14

MS. BRINKMANN:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

They

make decisions about --

15
16

Do they

QUESTION:

What are the statutes which allow

them to do that?

17

MS. BRINKMANN:

They make decisions about

18

furlough.

That's granted authority to them by Congress,

19

about the good conduct release, about placement in

20

community correction centers.

21

QUESTION:

But those are things that happen

22

in -- good conduct release determines the conduct in

23

prison.

24
25

The furloughs depends on conduct in prison.
MS. BRINKMANN:

Your Honor, also it depends on

the criminal history of the individual, as does placement
32

1

in a community correction facility.

2

We would also point out that the statutory text

3

granting this authority does not have any restrictions on

4

other factors that the Bureau of Prisons consider and, as

5

I mentioned before, it's very analogous in that respect to

6

INS v. Yang, where the Court recognized that although

7

Congress had provided a statute that allowed the Attorney

8

General to grant a deportation waiver to an alien who had

9

committed entry fraud, that that nonetheless still allowed

10

the Attorney General to take into account circumstances

11

surrounding the fraud in exercising their discretion

12

whether or not to grant that waiver, and that's

13

particularly the situation here.

14

QUESTION:

So it would be permissible, I

15

suppose, for the Bureau of Prisons to decide that any

16

person who entered the country illegally would be

17

ineligible for this program.

18
19
20

MS. BRINKMANN:

Subject to arbitrary and

capricious review.
QUESTION:

Well, it wouldn't be arbitrary.

21

just have experience that these people tend to be

22

recidivists, or something like that.

23

MS. BRINKMANN:

They

Yes, Your Honor, and all this

24

does is eliminate one incentive to the program.

25

mentioned, there is substantial participation without it,
33

As I

1

and the Bureau of Prisons in its exercise of its expertise

2

and broad authority has also implemented other incentives

3

through regulation for the program.

4

QUESTION:

Ms. Brinkmann, may I ask how the

5

Bureau of Prisons implements this with respect to

6

possession of drug offenders who do not carry firearms?

7

Is that also categorical?

8

commits a nonviolent offense without using a gun, who

9

successfully completes the program, do they as a category

10

That is, does everyone who

get a reduction?

11

MS. BRINKMANN:

Yes.

Any prisoner who

12

successfully completes the program is granted -- and is

13

convicted of a nonviolent offense is granted early

14

release.

15

It may not be the full 12 months.
QUESTION:

How is that?

You've just answered my

16

first inquiry about, it's discretion both ways, exercises

17

discretion to have categories of inclusion, exclusion.

18

you fit that category you get released, so it's not that

19

they're doing it case-by-case for people who commit

20

nonviolent offenses without guns, but categorically for

21

the other.

22

MS. BRINKMANN:

If

Your Honor, it is case-by-case.

23

Except, it's incorporated in this categorical

24

determination of successful completion of the program.

25

That incorporates any type of infractions, disciplinary
34

1
2
3
4

problems -QUESTION:

Yes, but we passed that hurdle.

Everyone -MS. BRINKMANN:

After all of that is completed,

5

yes, that is when early release is granted.

6

up to 12 months, because in the exercise of discretion the

7

Bureau of Prisons tempers the amount of early release,

8

depending on the completion of the program.

9

It may not be

For example, if a prisoner is sent to the

10

community corrections facility the bureau ensures that

11

they complete the 6-month transitional drug abuse program

12

there, and that may cut into their year of early release.

13

They may end up only getting 6 months of early release,

14

for example.

15

QUESTION:

Let's take the case of a nonviolent

16

offender who does not come within the bureau's regulation

17

as the gun, and so forth.

18

early release, even though it's not the full 12 months?

19

MS. BRINKMANN:

Do all of them get some form of

If they successfully complete

20

the program, yes, Your Honor.

21

of course, as we point out in the brief, that are

22

categorically denied early release, and for similar

23

reasons in the expertise of the Bureau of Prisons has

24

determined that they pose a greater threat to the

25

community when they're released, prisoners with prior
35

There are other categories,

1

convictions for serious crimes such as homicide,

2

aggravated rape and assault, and also prisoners whose

3

current offense involves sexual abuse of children.

4

are also categorical determinations, and it is consist --

5
6
7

QUESTION:

Those

And they are regarded as nonviolent

offenses?
MS. BRINKMANN:

In some instances they may be,

8

Your Honor, and the Bureau of Prisons has set forth this

9

regulation in order to further its purpose of consistency

10

and even-handedness in applying this program, and to give

11

fair notice to prisoners.

12

I'd also like to emphasize that looking at the

13

prior convictions and circumstances surrounding an

14

offense, it's reasonable when predicting and looking at

15

the threat to the danger of the community, because in fact

16

that is all conduct that occurs in the community.

17

One can say it's more rational, perhaps, to look

18

at a prisoner's use of a gun when they were in a community

19

when deciding what their conduct may be when they return

20

to the community as a postinfraction during their term --

21

QUESTION:

The difficulty with that argument,

22

that assuming that the incentive does increase the success

23

rate of the scheme, the Bureau of Prisons argument seems

24

to say, we would rather have gun-carriers using drugs

25

released a year later than former gun-carriers not using
36

1

drugs released a year earlier, and that doesn't seem quite

2

so rational.

3

MS. BRINKMANN:

We think that's precisely the

4

type of expertise, though, that Congress relies on the

5

Bureau of Prisons to bring to this type of decision.

6

That's why Congress did not --

7

QUESTION:

No, but the way I just stated it, it

8

seems irrational, and are you saying that the Bureau of

9

Prisons has a reason to say that my factual assumptions

10

just don't operate, that in fact the gun-carriers just do

11

not seem to be subject to this inducement and therefore

12

it's better not even to get into the question of early

13

release?

14

Is that their reason?
MS. BRINKMANN:

Their theory, as they set forth

15

in the program statement, is that the use of a gun in the

16

course of a drug transaction increases the likelihood of

17

use of force and violence, and for that reason granting

18

early release is not appropriate.

19

effect of serving the entire sentence is something that

20

the Bureau of Prisons has determined is appropriate in

21

those types of cases.

22

QUESTION:

The full deterrent

Ms. Brinkmann, can I go back to one

23

of your responses to the Chief Justice?

24

you on the question of previous convictions for violent

25

crimes for -- you mentioned some specific crimes, and he
37

When he pressed

1

asked, are they nonviolent crimes, and you said in some

2

instances they are, but in some instances -- or in some

3

instances they aren't, you said.

4

they are.

5

MS. BRINKMANN:

6

QUESTION:

But in some instances

Yes.

And I assume that if we read the may,

7

or more precisely if we read the excluded category of

8

violent, of persons in prison for a violent offense as

9

being exclusive, so that the Bureau of Prisons cannot add

10

to that category, the result, I gather, would be that you

11

could have somebody who happens to be in this time for a

12

nonviolent offense, but who was convicted five times

13

before of the most heinous, violent offenses, including

14

murder, and that person would have to be released.

15

MS. BRINKMANN:

Precisely, Your Honor.

It's the

16

situation where the instant offense is a conviction for

17

money laundering of the hit man who has many, perhaps even

18

a series of convictions, whether in the Federal or the

19

State system.

20

the Bureau of Prisons looked to in deciding to exercise

21

its discretion --

22

That's exactly the type of categories that

QUESTION:

So it's quite plausible that when

23

Congress was enacting this thing, that one thing was

24

obvious, we don't want someone --

25

MS. BRINKMANN:

Yes.

offense to get out a year early, and there may be some

3

other categories, too.

all of them.

Prisons.

6

We don't want to trouble to list

We'll leave the rest to the Bureau of

You're asserting that that's what they did.
MS. BRINKMANN:

Absolutely, Your Honor, and that

7

is totally supported by the text, because of the point I

8

think Your Honor and some of the other members of the

9

Court made, when you look at the language of the

10

neighboring statute using the word shall to mandate the

11

provision of the substance abuse treatment program.

12

Bureau of Prisons does not have discretion to not make

13

available the substance abuse program to prisoners who are

14

eligible, and the terminology in the statute for that is

15

someone who --

16

QUESTION:

That's not the point.

The

I mean, we're

17

all agreed that it has discretion.

18

whether it has discretion or not.

19

the may that's the issue here.

20

other provision, namely the disqualification of non -- of

21

violent offenders is meant to be exclusive.

22

the crucial provision here.

23

MS. BRINKMANN:

The issue is not
It's really -- it isn't

The issue is whether that

That's really

And we believe it's clearly not,

24

Your Honor.

That sets a statutory eligibility

25

requirement, a threshold, but there's no indication that
39

1

then the Congress intended to impose restriction on

2

factors that may be related to that eligibility.

3

QUESTION:

Do we give the bureau chevron

4

deference on that question as to whether that provision

5

was meant to be exclusive or not?

6

MS. BRINKMANN:

Yes, we believe so, Your Honor,

7

and we believe that it's regulation here is a

8

authoritative statement of its implementation of the

9

statute.

10

QUESTION:

May I ask about the regulation?

The

11

whole regulation isn't quoted in your brief, but the part

12

that you have quoted on page 4 refers to the offense for

13

which -- the current offense is a felony, b) that involved

14

the carrying and so forth of a gun, so the regulation

15

we're fighting about in this case is one that speaks only

16

to the current offense.

17

MS. BRINKMANN:

18

QUESTION:

19

That's correct, Your Honor.

Then is there another regulation that

disqualifies people because of their recidivism character?

20

MS. BRINKMANN:

Yes, Your Honor.

Petitioner had

21

actually provided the full regulation in their brief.

22

It's in the blue brief, the appendix, beginning on page 3,

23

and --

24

QUESTION:

3 of the appendix?

25

MS. BRINKMANN:

Yes, and carrying over to
40

1

page -- well, page 3, you have to see that (a)(1) explains

2

that in the exercise of discretion the Director of the

3

Federal Bureau of Prisons is deeming certain categories of

4

inmates not eligible for the early release.

5

is INS detainees, then we go on to pretrial inmates,

6

contractual boarders, all of which are ineligible for

7

reasons that are clear to the Bureau of Prisons in their

8

expertise of the management of prisons.

9

The first one

Subparagraph (4) talks about inmates who have a

10

prior felony or misdemeanor conviction for homicide,

11

forcible rape, robbery, or aggravated assault, or child

12

sexual abuse offenses.

13

prisoners who are ineligible for the community-based

14

corrections program.

15

which talks about inmates whose current offense is a

16

felony, and then there are four subcategories of those,

17

one being the subcategory at issue here, a felony that

18

involved the carrying, possession, or use of a firearm or

19

other dangerous weapon.

The next category has to do with

Then we get down to subcategory (6),

20

One of those other categories are offenses that

21

are felony -- that involve sexual abuse committed against

22

children.

23

attempt or threatened use of physical force.

24

a felony that by its nature or conduct presents a serious

25

potential risk of physical force against that person or

The other two have to do with the actual

41

The other is

1
2
3
4

property.
QUESTION:

Would that be a violent offense?

Probably not, I guess, huh?
MS. BRINKMANN:

One of the reasons that the

5

Bureau of Prisons set forth these was to ensure that it

6

had exercised its discretion in a regulatory manner

7

because of problems that had arisen with inconsistent

8

statutory interpretations by the lower Federal courts,

9

which create inordinate problems for the Bureau of Prisons

10

because of the -- not only that they have personnel in

11

different areas of the country implementing different

12

standards, but also prisoners are frequently transferred

13

between different circuits.

14

So they set forth -- and as pointed out, some of

15

these offenses could also be covered under the violent

16

offense category, but they wanted to set forth, out of

17

fairness to prisoners also, notice beforehand, and also

18

for the even-handed administration of the incentive.

19

QUESTION:

One argument that's made is, because

20

a couple of circuits said the bureau was wrong initially

21

when it typed people who carried guns in connection with

22

possession offenses, drug possession offenses, typed them

23

violent and then said the -- and then the prison

24

responded, Bureau of Prisons responded by saying, we're

25

not -- no longer categorizing them as violent offenders,
42

1

we're exercising our discretion to exclude them.

2

That could be characterized as trying to do an

3

end run around the court of appeals decisions that said,

4

these crimes are not crimes of violence.

5

MS. BRINKMANN:

Your Honor, we do believe that

6

the Bureau of Prisons' initial regulation actually was a

7

permissible regulation.

8

circuits because the courts -- because of their reference

9

to 924(c).

They ran into problems in some

The court then held that they, the Bureau of

10

Prisons, could not look to anything beyond the elements of

11

the offense.

12

That was really the problem there.

So the Bureau of Prisons came back and decided

13

to, as a matter of discretion, exercise that authority and

14

make clear.

We don't think there's anything impermissible

15

about that.

In fact, it's consistent with

16

well-established administrative law principles that a

17

agency's hands cannot be tied because of the inartful

18

drafting of a prior regulation.

19

QUESTION:

You're saying end runs --

20

QUESTION:

Ms. Brinkmann, if you'll go back to

21

section 6 of appendix 4 of the petitioner's brief it says,

22

sets forth four categories, has an element, the actual

23

attempted or threatened use of physical force against the

24

person or property of another, involve the carrying,

25

possession, or use of firearm or other dangerous weapons
43

1

or explosives, c) that by nature conduct presents a

2

serious potential risk.

3

embezzlement and false tax returns?

4

MS. BRINKMANN:

What isn't included, other than

Any kind of drug offenses, Your

5

Honor, that don't involve the use or carrying of a

6

firearm, certainly, and all kinds -- I mean, this doesn't

7

just have to be drug-related offenses.

8
9

I can tell you, there's a substantial
participation, Your Honor.

The Bureau of Prisons informed

10

me that currently there are approximately 16,800 prisoners

11

participating in the program at one of -- either on the

12

wait list, in the residential program, or in the

13

transitional program currently, and --

14

QUESTION:

15

MS. BRINKMANN:

16

QUESTION:

17

Who are eligible?
No, Your Honor.

30 percent --

Well, but that's not responsive, is

it?

18

MS. BRINKMANN:

But Your Honor, at least

19

one-third of those prisoners are not eligible for early

20

release.

21

is a life change, and that in fact --

22

The real incentive in this program, Your Honor,

QUESTION:

But then you're saying the

23

congressional -- Congress was wrong in providing an

24

incentive.

25

MS. BRINKMANN:

No, Your Honor.
44

1

QUESTION:

It wasn't needed.

2

MS. BRINKMANN:

No, Your Honor, it is an

3

incentive.

4

to use in implementing the drug abuse program and, as I

5

mentioned before, the Bureau of Prisons has, in fact, by

6

regulation promulgated other incentives having to do with

7

the prisoner being able to obtain the maximum time in a

8

community correction facility.

9

incentives for completion of the various phases of the

There are financial

program.

11

So that is the Bureau of Prisons implementing

12

the program and fulfilling the mandate that they make

13

available this program to any prisoner who has a substance

14

abuse program and wants to participate in it.

15
16

QUESTION:

May I just ask, the 16,800 is a large

number, but compared to how many people in prison?

17

MS. BRINKMANN:

18

QUESTION:

19

MS. BRINKMANN:

20

QUESTION:

21

Approximately 130 to 140,000 --

About 10 percent, then.
-- is the current population.

But how many are eligible as

nonviolent offenders, of that total number?

22

MS. BRINKMANN:

23

QUESTION:

Yes.

Out of the 130 to 140 -How many are there because of

24

nonviolent offenses and therefore eligible for this

25

program?
45

1

MS. BRINKMANN:

I don't have that information.

2

that was not ascertainable, and I also must say, Your

3

Honor, out of that number you'd have to winnow it down to

4

the prisoners who are actually statutorily eligible under

5

(e)(1), which means a prisoner who has a documented

6

substance abuse program and who are willing to participate

7

in this very rigorous program.

8

QUESTION:

Clarify one thing for me.

You don't

9

have to be not -- nonviolent is only for eligibility for

10

the 1-year shortening of the sentence, but even a person

11

guilty of a violent offense is eligible for the program,

12

aren't they?

13

MS. BRINKMANN:

14

QUESTION:

15

MS. BRINKMANN:

16
17

That's correct, Your Honor.

Yes.
And they're also eligible for

the other incentives that the Bureau of Prisons provides.
QUESTION:

But to get either in the program or

18

the 1 year, you would have to have a history of drug

19

abuse, so I -- is that --

20

MS. BRINKMANN:

21

program, that's correct.

22

QUESTION:

Yes, to be able to get into the

So I guess if you were unfortunate

23

enough not to have a history of drug abuse, you can't get

24

that 1 year.

25

MS. BRINKMANN:

That's true, Your Honor.
46

1

QUESTION:

2

MS. BRINKMANN:

3
4
5

That's sort of tough, isn't it?
That was Congress'

determination, because -QUESTION:

I guess a lot of prisoners are trying

to show they had a history of drug abuse, right?

6

(Laughter.)

7

MS. BRINKMANN:

The bureau -- unfortunately,

8

there is a very high percentage of Federal prisoners that

9

do have problems, but again it goes back to the

10

determination that Congress wanted to provide the Bureau

11

of Prisons with this authority that it could grant this

12

early release.

13

authority or discretion without this statutory provision

14

to grant anyone early release.

The Bureau of Prisons does not have any

If there's nothing further, Your Honor.

Mr. Meierhenry, you have 4 minutes remaining.

Thank you, Ms. Brinkmann.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK MEIERHENRY

19

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

20

MR. MEIERHENRY:

21

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Counsel, I assume under your argument

22

that we would have to strike down subsection 4 of the

23

regulation, which applies to inmates who have a prior

24

felony or misdemeanor.

25

MR. MEIERHENRY:

Yes, Your Honor, I think that's
47

1

correct.

2

To answer statistically, and my source is the

3

website of the Bureau of Prisons, there -- as of August of

4

2000 there were 63,621 inmates, or 56.9 percent of all the

5

inmates in Federal prison were there for drug-related

6

charges.

7

website that 2,633 people in 1999 got the incentive.

The Bureau of Prisons also shows on their

8

QUESTION:

9

to Justice Kennedy?

Could I ask you about your response
I suppose you could have a theory

10

that the only thing that's explicitly excluded is an

11

additional disqualification based upon the offense for

12

which you're sentenced, because use of a gun involves the

13

very offense for which he's serving, right?

14

You don't have to carry the burden of saying

15

that recidivism or a prior violent crime can't be taken

16

into account, because that is not the condition that

17

Congress has set forth.

18

to was the very offense for which you're sentenced.

19

MR. MEIERHENRY:

The only condition Congress spoke

Correct, as a convicted person,

20

and maybe my definition isn't quite right, but I mean,

21

when you -- even when you get the chevron, the gap here,

22

there is no gap.

23

Nonviolent, convicted person.

24
25

Congress didn't create a gap.

What they left the discretion to is the
treatment or the actions of the prisoners, and those
48

judgments within -- once he was prisoner.

3

QUESTION:

I mean, the

Well, but Justice Scalia's question

would push it further than that and say it also, as I

understood it, would leave discretion to acts committed

long before you were sentenced this time.

MR. MEIERHENRY:
address that.

And I don't -- Congress did not

Congress did not address that.

9

QUESTION:

Well, even if --

10

QUESTION:

Well, if Congress didn't address it,

11

why doesn't it fall within the -- I mean, it doesn't

12

really affect your case, it but affects the argument

13

perhaps.

14

discretion?

15
16

Why doesn't that thing fall within the bureau's

MR. MEIERHENRY:

Because Congress, in creating

the incentive --

17

QUESTION:

Why do you want to hold that ground?

18

QUESTION:

You should -- it seems to me your

19

position is, subparagraph (6) would have to go entirely,

20

not just (6)(b), but subparagraph (4) would not have to go

21

under that theory.

22

QUESTION:

Right.

23

MR. MEIERHENRY:

I think one of the questions

24

asked by one of the members of the bench in the

25

INS v. Yang that my colleague brought up, some 4 years
49

1

ago, she was asked about the authority of the Attorney

2

General, and the question was, it's a longer question, but

3

the last part was, would it be within her, the Attorney

4

General's discretion to say, I will never exercise my

5

discretion in favor of a waiver, and Ms. Brinkmann

6

answered, yes, Your Honor, we believe it would be.

7

In the opinion, joined by all of you, it said,

8

it could be argued that if the Attorney General determined

9

that any entry, fraud or misrepresentation, no matter how

10

minor, no matter what the attendant circumstances, would

11

cause her to withhold waiver, she would be exercising --

12

she would not be exercising the conferred discretion at

13

all, but would be making a nullity of the statute.

14

my argument.

15

incentive.

16
17

The BOP is making a nullity of the

QUESTION:

We didn't say that argument was

right.

18

MR. MEIERHENRY:

19

QUESTION:

20

I understand that --

We just said it could be argued,

right?

21

MR. MEIERHENRY:

22

QUESTION:

23

That's

but I think it summarized --

And you're proving that it can be

argued.

24

(Laughter.)

25

MR. MEIERHENRY:

Your Honors, we would ask the
50

1

Court to overrule the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals and

2

find that the discretion that the BOP has is attendant to

3

within-the-prison and not preconviction activities.

Thank you.
