ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD J. LAZARUS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

MR. LAZARUS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
This case concerns the authority of a Federal

13

agency to promulgate a retroactive rule.

14

can be simply stated.

15

valid unless the agency's decision to impose the rule

16

retroactively is arbitrary and capricious.

17

Our position

A retroactive rule is generally

Unlike the D.C. Circuit, we do not believe

18

that the Administrative Procedure Act bars virtually all

19

retroactive rules regardless of their reasonableness,

20

nor do we believe that the Medicare Act prohibits all

21

retroactive cost limit rules in every circumstance.

22

Instead, in our view, retroactive cost limit

23

rules are valid in two different ways under the Medicare

24

Act, each sufficient by itself to support the rule

25

struck down by the lower court.

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Lazarus, I guess if we were to

2

find that the Medicare Act itself prohibits retroactive

3

rulemaking in this instance we wouldn't have to go on

4

and reach the APA question, would we?

5

MR. LAZARUS:

6

have to.

7

questions.

9

Technically the Court would not

We would urge the Court to address both

The Administrative Procedure Act issue is by
far the more important issue decided by the lower

10

court.

11

for administrative law questions, and it was decided by

12

that court, and there's no reason why the Court

13

logically has to address one rather than the other.

14

The D.C. Circuit is the most important circuit

So the Court technically does not have to, but

15

we would urge the Court to, and for the reasons in our

16

brief, present, we don't absolutely think the Medicare

17

Act itself does prohibit such rules.

The retroactive rule challenged in this case --

O'Connor's question is in the affirmative.

to, we would urge the Court.
The retroactive rule challenged in this case

24

finds its genesis in the 1981 determination of the

25

Secretary to make a wholly prospective change in the

1

Medicare Act cost limit rules.

2

At the time relevant to this litigation, the

3

Medicare Act allowed for reimbursement of providers of

4

health services for the reasonableâ€¢costs of their

5

services to Medicare beneficiaries.

6

To that end, the Act authorized the Secretary

7

to promulgate cost limit rules based on the estimates of

8

the costs necessary for the efficient delivery of health

9

services.

10

In 1981, the Secretary determined that his

11

then-existing rule regarding wage costs promulgated in

12

1979 required adjustment.

13

rule was based did not accurately reflect differences in

14

wage costs in different parts of the country.

15

The database upon which that

As a result the rule unfairly disadvantaged

16

certain providers in certain geographic areas.

17

providers were receiving inadequate reimbursement under

18

the Medicare Act while other providers were receiving

19

excessive reimbursement.

Those

20

Because the Secretary considered the

21

modifications necessary in the database to be of a minor

22

technical nature, he published the final revised rule

23

without first providing for public notice and comment.

24
25

Respondents filed suit, and in 1983 a Federal
district court invalidated the 1981 rule on procedural

grounds.

2

QUESTION:

Mr. Lazarus, before you go further

3

with the facts, I presume that the Secretary could have

4

amended the rule in such a fashion as to eliminate the

5

unfair disadvantage without eliminating what he regarded

6

as the unfair advantage, in which case there would have

7

been nobody to challenge the retroactive rule.

8
9
10
11

MR. LAZARUS:

The Secretary could have

approached it all kinds of different ways.

The question

is -QUESTION:

Well, I mean, you mentioned that it

12

unfairly disadvantaged some people and unfairly

13

advantaged others.

14

All we're really fighting about here are the

15

people that you assert it unfairly advantaged, because

16

you could have taken care of the people that it unfairly

17

disadvantaged.

18

MR. LAZARUS:

Well, not actually, I think,

19

under the way that the respondents would see the case.

20

They would suggest that any kind of retroactivity, and

21

if the Secretary is without authority to make any kind

22

of retroactive changes they would have been, in other

23

words confined to the 1979 rule, the Secretary should

24

have assigned recoupment from the others.

25

QUESTION:

But the Secretary could have issued
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

the rule eliminating the unfair disadvantage, not the

2

unfair advantage, and there would have been no one to

3

challenge it.

4

MR. LAZARUS:

5

QUESTION:

6
7

No, it was the same rule.

I understand it.

But the Secretary

could have split it in two and said -MR. LAZARUS:

What, provided two different

8

rules for two different -- the Secretary is certainly

9

within his discretion to announce one rule applying to

10

11

the entire -QUESTION:

My point is that we don't have to

12

find for you, in order to enable the unfair

13

disadvantaged to be eliminated.

14

about here is the unfair advantage.

15

MR. LAZARUS:

All we're fighting

Well, I think we're actually

16

fighting about, about both, particularly to the extent

17

that we're dealing with the broader questions of the

18

Secretary's authority in the future to promulgate

19

retroactive rules.

20

If the Secretary in the future decides that he

21

is incapable of promulgating a retroactive rule, then

22

other providers in this case who relied justifiably on

23

the 1979 rule would, I think, not have redress, and

24

instead the Secretary would have had to seek recoupment

25

against them.

QUESTION:

The Secretary can do all sorts of

things, so long as it doesn't hurt anybody.
MR. LAZARUS:

Right.

And the question still

4

remains whether or not it's within the Secretary's

5

discretion, I will grant you, to decide to treat them

6

all alike, under one rule.

7

The District Court invalidated the rule

8

concluding, the 1981 rule, that the APA required prior

9

notice and comment.

The District Court, however,

10

specifically declined respondents' request that it order

11

the Secretary to reimburse them pursuant to the 1979

12

prior rule.

13

the Secretary for further proceedings.

The court instead remanded the matter to

14

On remand, following a period of notice and

15

comment, the Secretary promulgated a new rule in 1984

16

that was identical in substance to the 1981 rule.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

But Mr. Lazarus, didn't they also

reimburse them under the 1979 rule?
MR. LAZARUS:

He did reimburse them under the

20

1979 rule as a matter of administrative grace.

21

doing so he made it clear that that determination was

22

subject to reopening, if he subsequently decided that

23

the appropriate cost limit rule was one that excluded

24

Federal wage data.

25

QUESTION:

But in

But it had an

Respondents were among the few providers to
receive less reimbursement under the retroactive rule,

10

brought suit arguing that it was invalid because of its

11

retroactivity.

12

The District Court agreed, narrowly concluding

13

that the statutory interest served by retroactivity did

14

not warrant the imposition of the burdens imposed on

15

respondents by a retroactive rule.

16

The D.C. Circuit affirmed, but did not so

17

narrowly grant its decision.

18

concluded that the Administrative Procedure Act bars

19

virtually all retroactive rules by defining them in

20

terms of their future effect.

21

That court instead

The court also concluded that retroactive cost

22

limit rules were not within the Secretary's general

23

rulemaking authority under the Medicare Act, nor the

24

court found were such rules within the Secretary's

25

authority under the retroactive corrective adjustment

1

provisions of that Act, known as Clause (ii).

2

We believe the decision of the Court of

3

Appeals, its judgment, should be reversed for two

4

independent reasons.

5

First, because the 1984 rule is a valid

6

exercise of the Secretary's general rulemaking authority

7

under the Medicare Act, and second, because it is valid

8

exercise for the Secretary's authority under Clause

9

(ii), which provides and authorizes the Secretary to

10

promulgate regulations for the making of retroactive

11

corrective adjustments.

12

The most important and the most sweeping

13

aspect of the Court of Appeals decision is also that

14

part which we believe is most clearly wrong.

15

Administrative Procedure Act does not bar all

16

retroactive rules.

17

The

The language upon which the Court of Appeals

18

relies which defines a rule in terms of its future

19

effect does not speak to the retroactivity issue at

20

all.

21

That language simply refers to when a rule

22

applies, not to what transactions, whether past or

23

present, applies.

24

of law that is not applied in the same proceeding in

25

which it is announced.

In other words, a rule is a statement

It just quotes the first

It leaves out the part which says,

"and

8

includes the approval or prescription, not in the

10

say,

13

here.

14

"costs or accounting or practices bearing on any of

It uses the phrase there "for the future."

15

You make a lot in your brief of the fact that it says,

23

testimony about ICC proceedings.

25

That language in the second part, to the extent

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

And because there was not unanimity on that question,

that particular language was added.

MR. LAZARUS:

No.

But let me get to the --

that was just basically the origin of that language,
which was dealing with a discreet problem.
But apart from that, the most, I think,

12

pertinent thing, if you look at the House report where

13

they added the terms, future effect, the House report

14

specifically states that it was, we think, not intended

15

to bar the kind of rule at issue here.

16

And the words they use in describing future

17

effect I think equate future effect in a way which both

18

shows that it wasn't intended to bar retroactive rules

19

and shows that the language "for the future" doesn't

20

mean anything different.

21

In the House report, it's on footnote 1, I

22

think it's cited in our brief.

But let me just read you

the pertinent language.

MR. LAZARUS:

And I think there are other

factors in the legislative history.

14

The fact that Congress considered bills which

15

would have explicitly barred retroactive rules and

16

decided not to include that language, and we have the

17

excerpt during the legislative hearings showing that

18

being discussed, and showing a distinction being drawn

19

between effectiveness and retroactivity and a notion

20

that there was a problem with barring retroactive rules,

21

particularly a problem because of the curative nature of

22

the rules.

23

One could read these things, as obviously

24

respondents do, differently.

25

reading, and certainly a reasonable reading,

is that,

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

and it's really unreasonable, we believe, to assume to

2

the contrary.

3

Retroactive rules were a traditional aspect of

4

administrative practice, rare, but appropriate in

discreet circumstances, before the APA was enacted, and

they have been ever since.

think there's no, it's not been litigated a lot.

drawing, both future effect referring to future

It wasn't designed to

prohibit certain kinds of rules.

It was designed to

describe generally what rules are.

But that's the purpose of the

about the notion that most, that rules generally have

It was designed to generally describe what a

When the words, Justice

If that's what future effect means,

19

that is it has some effect in the future though it also

Doesn't an adjudication have a future effect?

MR. LAZARUS:

They have

Well they only -- they have,

6

they have an ongoing future effect in terms of

effectiveness, while adjudication is different.

But I think it's more important to realize
that there are many different ways, as this Court has

realized, to distinguish rulemaking adjudication, each

one has its exceptions.

rule.

13

There is no real bright line

But I think that the most significant one, and

14

the one that is relevant for this case is the notion

that a rule is not applied in the same proceeding which

16

is then announced, while an adjudication is.

the handle which Justice Harlan also focused on in

And that's

As set out more fully in our brief, both the

language, both the structure and legislative history

support our view.

22

legislative history that we believe discuss directly the

retroactivity issue, both the House report and the

Attorney General's Manual on Administrative Procedure,

25

each of which we believe is consistent with our view.

There are two places in the

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Lazarus, it seems that

3

you're arguing that the APA allows retroactive

and capricious.

MR. LAZARUS:

That's right.

And it certainly

Well, that just seems to make

retroactive rulemaking totally available.
MR. LAZARUS:

Well no, we don't think it will

be totally available.

12

has before held it was barred, and they are rare.

13

In fact, as we've seen, no court

It's rarely done, because on fairness, which

14

is typically associated with retroactive rules, makes

15

the arbitrary and capricious standard a very significant

16

hurdle for the Secretary to overcome.

17

And all we're asking in this case is an

18

opportunity to show the Court of Appeals that this rule

19

instance?

2

MR. LAZARUS:

No, we think that this is a very

3

good case for the arbitrary and capricious standard,

4

because the respondents incurred all of their costs

5

prior to the time at which the 1981 was first

6

invalidated on procedural grounds.

7

Therefore, the rule that they had to rely on

8

was the '81 rule.

of the same problems of unfairness, because all those

advantage --

13

QUESTION:

Well, Congress could have done it.

14

Congress could have pulled his coal out of the fire, if,

15

if that was a problem.

16

And in that -- you make a lot in your brief

17

about, well, it's so necessary, just as it's necessary

18

for Congress to legislate retroactively now and then.

19

But if Congress can't legislate retroactively there's no

20

remedy.

21

There is a remedy here.

If the Secretary

22

can't issue a retroactive rule he can go to Congress and

23

say, enact a retroactive statute, can't he?

24

MR. LAZARUS:

25

QUESTION:

That's true.

So the situation is quite different
19

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

from the legislative situation.

2

MR. LAZARUS:

But we believe that Congress,

3

when it delegates general rulemaking authority to an

4

agency, it includes the authority in discreet

5

circumstances to deal with, to impose retroactive rules,

6

knowing that the kinds of concerns that one has with

7

retroactivity can be addressed through the arbitrary and

8

capricious review.

9

In the general rulemaking provision of the

10

Medicare Act, Congress gave the Secretary full power to

11

promulgate rules.

12

legislative power, which would include in certain very

13

discreet circumstances retroactive rules.

14

We think that it's essentially full

opportunity to show that in this case the types of

18

unfairness concerns are not really implicated, and that

19

this rule is for that reason not arbitrary and

20

capricious.

21

We're not saying that all retroactive cost
All we're asking for is an

Respondents notably do not rely heavily on the

22

Court of Appeals' construction of the Administrative

23

Procedure Act, but instead rely principally on the

24

argument that the Medicare Act, wholly apart from the

25

Administrative Procedure Act, bars retroactive cost
20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

limit rules.

2

The problem with their analysis is twofold.

3

First, we don't believe that anything in the language of

4

the statute states that cost limit rules must be

5

prospective, and second, the legislative history upon

6

which they rely does not speak to the type of

7

retroactive rule at issue in this case, which is merely

8

curative in nature.

9

The statutory language, which is in Section

10

1395x(v)(1)(A), reproduced on pages 2 and 3 of our

11

brief, does not have any kind of a hint of a

12

prospectivity requirement.

13

It states broadly that the Secretary may

14

promulgate cost limit rules based on estimates of the

15

costs necessary in the efficient delivery of health

16

services.

17

unambiguous, and there's no prospectivity requirement.

The language is straightforward,

it's

18

Respondents' only meaningful answer to the

19

statutory language are statements in the legislative

20

history that say that cost limit rules would operate

21

prospectively.

22

In our view, those statements reflect

23

Congress' understanding that cost limit rules generally

24

in practice would operate prospectively, which is in

25

fact what they do in practice.
21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

But we think those statements fall far short

2

of suggesting that Congress decided and considered the

3

possibility of retroactive rules being appropriate in

4

certain confined circumstances.

5

Indeed, the very reasons that Congress gives

6

for generally favoring prospective rules we believe are

7

the reasons it is most unlikely that Congress intended

8

to bar all retroactive rules.

9

Congress was concerned about providers

10

incurring costs before they knew the substance of the

11

cost limit rule.

12

of their costs before the 1981 rule was invalidated.

13

In this case respondents incurred all

In fact, as I mentioned earlier, for this

14

reason if the Secretary had not promulgated a

15

retroactive rule, the very concerns expressed by

16

Congress would have been realized, because other

17

providers relied to their advantage on the substance of

18

the 1981 rule in incurring their costs.

This is not a rule that the Secretary

promulgated to, despite its unfairness.

compelling reasons.

QUESTION:

And if you look at the

There's no question that under the,

6

under the provision of, of the subject legislation, the

7

Secretary could have recomputed for each of those

8

individual hospitals the charges and found that the

9

regulations didn't provide a fair return in this

10
11
12

situation.

There's no doubt he could have done that.
MR. LAZARUS:

It's within the Secretary's

discretion.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. LAZARUS:

Both sides acknowledge that.
That's right.

The question is

15

whether, how much further the Secretary can go, whether

16

the Secretary can approach these things in what we

17

believe is an efficient manner, and that is in a

18

systemic basis correcting the rule itself, rather than

19

being forced to go through numerous and we believe

20

duplicative and wasteful case by case review.

If there are no further questions --

QUESTION:

Are you going to address the point

23

of what regulation takes over, if the agency cannot

24

issue a new one retroactively?

25

MR. LAZARUS:

Our dispute with the Court of
24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Appeals on that, on that question is the following.

2

The Court of Appeals has stated that the

3

invalidation of the 1981 rule necessarily had the effect

4

of reinstating the 1979 rule, so as to preclude the

5

Secretary from on remand promulgating a new rule.
We believe that as a general rule a court's

6
7

authority to issue a remedy is confined to the nature of

8

the agency's error.

9

Now that may have the result, Justice Scalia,

10

that may have the result of leaving the only valid

11

agency action remaining to be a prior agency rule.

12

that does not preclude the agency on remand from

13

determining in the first instance what law should apply,

14

perhaps by subsequently promulgating a retroactive rule,

15

perhaps by immediately promulgating on an interim basis

16

a rule.

Does this argument of yours hinge

18

upon your retroactivity argument?

MR. LAZARUS:

If we reject your

Again, it would depend on the

22

nature -- in some instances, for instance, the court's

23

decision would only suggest that the substance of the

24

new rule was valid, and it might not, it might only

25

question the agency's determination that a substance of

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

a new rule was valid itself.

2

It might not question the agency's

3

determination that the old rule was invalid, in which

4

case it wouldn't necessarily leave the prior agency

5

action intact, and for that reason I think undermines

6

why it's important that the agency should be able to

7

decide on remand, because in the absence of that there

8

would essentially be absence of power of retroactivity,

there would be virtually no, no law to apply.

I, when I stated our four grounds I used the

8

O'Connor, we agree that if we are correct on the

In our view it is absolutely clear that the

12

Medicare statute precludes the Secretary from issuing a

13

retroactive cost limit rule.

14

provision, Section 223(b) of the 1972 amendment, uses

15

words that import prospectivity, and I think that is

16

specifically confirmed by the legislative history.

17

The governing statutory

Both the House and Senate reports expressly

18

state that the limits must be exercised on a prospective

The Secretary's regulations state that the

limits will be imposed prospectively, and the

22

prospectivity requirement is also confirmed by all of

23

the Secretary's prior schedules and by his own

24

administrative decision-making.

25

construction.

our public comments, but the Secretary did not respond.

We reminded the Secretary of this fact in

There is nothing in the record to reconcile

what the Secretary has done here with the statutory

language or the legislative history or the Secretary's

or the Secretary's own prior decision-making.

9

simply no explanation to reconcile.

10

QUESTION:

There is

Mr. Sutter, let me come back to the

11

problem of the Secretary revising the regulation in

12

order to give more money to some people.

13

I suppose even if, even if it was an improper

14

revision of the regulation retroactively, there'd be

15

nobody to challenge it, so he could do it with

16

impunity.

MR. SUTTER:

correct, I suppose he could, what, present a, in an

20

appropriations bill a little, a little line that says -MR. SUTTER:

possibility, Justice Scalia.
QUESTION:

MR. SUTTER:

14

country.

16

data.

17

18

He did not pay those other hospitals under the

And in other circumstances he has clearly

19

taken the position that he's not required to recoup in

20

circumstances similar to these, we have cited that in

21

the last paragraph of our footnote 36, which contains

22

those references.

23

And Judge Oberdorfer in his decision in this

24

case, at pages 38 and 39 of the petition appendix,

25

explains, provides further reasons why there, why

32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

recoupment would not be required from other hospitals.

2

So I think there's simply no merit at all to

3

that, to the suggestion from the Secretary on that

4

point.

5

The Secretary now relies on, although he did

6

not rely on during the rulemaking, the retroactive

7

corrective adjustment provision, which dates from the

8

original 1965 legislation.

9

He argues that that provision confers on him

10

the authority to issue retroactive rules, including

11

retroactive cost limit rules.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. SUTTER:

Which section is this, Mr. Sutter?

This is, Mr. Chief Justice, you

14

will find this in our appendix at page 4, before you get

15

to number 5, the public law, it's maybe, oh, about eight

16

or nine pages down from the top there's a little two

17

(inaudible), the language that begins, "provide with the

18

making of suitable retroactive corrective adjustments."

19

That is the language that the Secretary is now relying

20

on.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. SUTTER:

23
24
25

And that's a part of Section 1861.
That is part of 1861 (v) (1) (A) .

That's correct.
We believe that the Secretary's reliance on
that provision is clearly misplaced for several
33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

reasons.

2

Congress enacted Section 223(b) of the 1972 amendments,

3

it made as clear as it possibly could that cost limits

4

are to apply only on a prospective basis.

5

First, it subverts Congressional intent.

That clear expression of Congressional intent

6

must prevail, however the retroactive provision is

7

construed in other circumstances.

8
9
10

11

When

QUESTION:

And then for that you rely on the

phrase, to be recognized as reasonable, in another part
of 1861?
MR. SUTTER:

That is the statutory language.

12

That's correct.

13

both the House and Senate report, which state that the

14

limits must be exercised on a prospective rather than

15

retrospective basis.

16

And I rely on the specific words in

Section 223(b) would trump the retroactive

17

provision here.

18

more significant is, the interpretation which the

19

Secretary is advancing here is post hoc interpretation

20

conflicts with his own regulations.

21

But, the second point that may be even

His regulations have never construed the

22

retroactive provision as conferring on him the authority

23

to issue retroactive rules.

24

construed that provision as a year-end accounting

25

reconciliation process.

His regulations have always

did not.

8

rely on the provision in promulgating those rules.

9

that was a rule involving secondary retroactivity, not

He did not

primary retroactivity.

11

QUESTION:

Did he cite the statutory authority

12

for those recapture regulation -- or the recapture

13

rules?

14

MR. SUTTER:

Well at the end, I mean, he

15

always has a little section which, which cites the

16

authority.

17

And

I'm sure he included, I didn't specifically

18

look at this.

19

But there's nothing in the preamble which would suggest

20

that he thought he was acting pursuant to some kind of

21

special delegation of retroactive rulemaking authority,

22

as there was not in the preamble here.

23

I'm sure he included Section 1861 (v) .

And I might also note that the Secretary could

24

not in good faith have done that in the 1984 preamble,

25

because at the same time that he was publishing this

And for evidence of that you can look at the

5

9th Circuit's decision in Regents of the University of

6

California, which is reported as 771 F.2d.

the retroactive provision, means exactly what he says in

What the Secretary has done here, this

post-hoc construction, which he cannot cite any

from 22 years of consistent agency construction.

That's

his post hoc construction, is not a possible reading of

QUESTION:

It would also be strange to say

3

that the regulations shall provide for the issuance of

4

regulations, that's rather a strange --

5

6

MR. SUTTER:

That is correct, yes.

That's

correct.

7

I'd now like to consider the APA.

There are

8

two relevant statutory provisions, 5 USC Section 551(4)

9

and 5 USC Section 553(d).

Section 551(4) defines a rule

10

as something having, among other things, future effect,

11

and states it includes the prescription for the future

12

of certain matters, matters that would be encompassed

13

within this case.

14

I think Justice Scalia was entirely correct in

15

pointing out that there's a big difference between in

16

the future and for the future.

17

that if an agency publishes a rule in 1984, applies it

18

in 1985, to recoup from 1981, the Secretary is acting in

19

the future, at least from a 1984 vantage point.

20

is not acting for the future.

21

QUESTION:

It is certainly correct

But he

Well, do you think the definition

22

of rules set out in that definitional section of the APA

23

is kind of the be-all and end-all, that it meant to just

24

describe the full length and breadth of anything that a

25

rule could do?

MR. SUTTER:

I don't think it's the be-all and

2

the end-all.

3

illustrated when you look at the legislative history and

4

you also look at 5 USC Section 553(d), which generally

5

prescribes a 30-day delayed effective date.

But I think the significance is

I think it's important to look at those two

together.

And I think the legislative history does

8

confirm a plain meaning construction.

volume at page 254, that rules formally prescribe a

11

course of conduct for the future rather than pronounce

12

past or existing rights or liabilities.

13

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Sutter, do you take the

14

position today then that no retroactive rulemaking is

15

allowed under the APA?
MR. SUTTER:

16
17

No, Justice O'Connor, we do not.

We -QUESTION:

18

Well, what defines the exceptions

19

then, and how do you derive those from the plain

20

language?

21

MR. SUTTER:

Let me give you an example.

22

Justice Frankfurter stated in the Addison case that law

23

should avoid retroactivity as much as possible.

24
25

And I think the thing to focus on is whether
it is possible to avoid retroactivity.

I think there

38
ALDERSOIM REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

may be some instances in which it will not be possible

2

to avoid even primary retroactivity.

3

Suppose, for instance, that a statute requires

4

that a certain benefit be in effect as of a certain date

5

in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary,

6

the clear Congressional intent that the Secretary have

7

regulations in place as of a certain date, and the

8

Secretary simply doesn't do so.

9

In that case I concede that it would be

10

possible to allow him to issue them retroactively.

11

see that as simply a case of the more specific

12

prevailing over the general, the specific intent of

13

Congress that these regulations be in place as of a

14

certain date prevailing over the general rule in the

15

APA.

16

I see it as a general rule in the APA.

17

believe that's also how the D.C. Circuit saw it.

18

QUESTION:

I

Well, what if Congress provided

19

that the Secretary of Energy shall by such and such a

20

date issue regulations prohibiting anyone from charging

21

more than 80 cents a gallon for gasoline, and the

22

Secretary does not promulgate those regulations by that

23

date, he promulgates them 20 days later, but he includes

24

in that rule a statement that they shall be effective

25

from the date that Congress said the regulation should

2

MR. SUTTER:

Yes, it is.

Because I see

3

Congress' more specific intent controlling in that

4

case.

5

QUESTION:

Well, why, why should the rule be

6

different if the Secretary, he doesn't fail to issue a

7

regulation but he issues one that is invalid

procedurally?

MR. SUTTER:

That is -- I didn't

3

MR. SUTTER:

Well, there are two reasons that

he cannot here.

5

this rule is of no effect, it leaves in place what was

6

there before.

7

One is, he had a pre-existing rule.

If

That's one reason.

The cost limits would not, I think, in any

8

event allow the Secretary to act retroactively, not only

9

because Congress said they had to be prospective, but

10

also because Congress has never mandated that there be

11

cost limits.

12

The Congress authorized the Secretary to issue

13

cost limits.

14

the 16 years since Section 223(b) was enacted, for seven

15

of those 16 years there have been no cost limits, and

16

there haven't been any since 1983.

17

It did not require him to do so.

QUESTION:

And in

Mr. Sutter, depending on what the

18

procedural deficiency is, there's also some room for

19

courts of appeals to remand to the agency without

20

setting aside the rule, isn't there?
I mean, frequently when what is lacking is a

21

22

sufficiently precise statement of basis and purpose, the

23

Court of Appeals will simply remand for a more precise

24

statement.

25

MR. SUTTER:

That is correct.

9

And in DCHA, the Secretary did expressly ask

10

that Judge Oberdorfer stay his decision so that the

11

Secretary could take further action, and Judge

12

Oberdorfer declined to do that.

13

But he did cite several of the sort of cases

14

that you're referring to, and he distinguished those and

15

said, no, that that remedy would clearly be inapplicable

here.

17

One of the points I think is important is that

if the Secretary disagreed with Judge Oberdorfer at that

19

point in DCHA, he should have appealed.

21

clearly indicated that these corrective procedures would

QUESTION:

The Secretary doesn't want to waive

So what if the Secretary, after Judge Oberdorfer's

decision, had sued some of the hospitals who had

benefited from the regulation saying, we now think, we

12

have a court decision saying this is invalid, we want to

13

get our money back from you.

14

Now, presumably the hospitals would have a

15

right to litigate that question, because they're not

bound by DCHA.

agrees with Judge Oberdorfer, that this regulation was

invalid, can't the Secretary then get the money back?

I would like to briefly address the

13

that the, the Secretary's attempted curing* is something

that cannot be done because of the very nature of the

MR. LAZARUS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

have just a few points in rebuttal.

12

First, the District Court did not order the

13

Secretary to reimburse him pursuant to the 1979 rule.

14

The court found only one error in the 1981 rule, the

15

lack of notice and comment, and specifically declined to

16

order the Secretary to reimburse him pursuant to the

17

1979 rule.

21

just didn't go through the rulemaking proceeding, is the

22

only thing he did wrong.

MR. LAZARUS:

It was an, it was an error which

24

25

larger amount of Medicare reimbursement than they would

He recognized that for

that reason it would be appropriate, and he didn't do

so.
