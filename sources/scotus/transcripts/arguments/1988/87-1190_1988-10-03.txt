that right.

We contend that they do not.

In a ruling that

The Court also held that the question of one

In essence exactly what the First

approach Is exactly the one this Court should adopt*
We think that approach follows pretty readily
from henna

The

In that footnote two things that we think are

quite validly removes the Issue of factual

Second» the Court expressly

We think the upshot of

those two observations together

Is that when the

Indictment Is valid on Its face» and a claim of
Invalidity depends on factual matters* the plea of
guilty quite validly resolves those factual

Issues*
