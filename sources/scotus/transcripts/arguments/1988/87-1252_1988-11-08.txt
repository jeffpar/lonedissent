ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK REINHARDT

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12

MR. REINHARDT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is a review of the dismissal of

13

Petitioners' complaint brought under 18 U.S.C. 1961 and

14

1968, commonly known as RICO.

15

in our complaint were a series of bribes carried out by

16

Northwestern Bell Telephone Company affecting a number

17

of different Northwestern Bell charges ranging from pay

18

phone rates to the cost of buying home telephones.

19

The specific acts alleged

These bribes, carried out over a period of

20

years, involved various Bell officials, agents, passing

21

over $140,000 to members of the Minnesota Public

22

Utilities Commission.

23

is the rate setting, semi- or quasi-judicial body in

24

Minnesota that sets Bell's rates.

25

The Public Utilities Commission

As pointed out in footnote 1 at page 4 of our

brief, a later commission discovered this activity of

2

Bell and reopened one of the many affected rates because

3

of this undue influence.

4

$57 million by over $10 million.

They cut that tainted rate of

This discussion should be broken into three

5

6

parts:

7

dismissal of this case should be reversed; second, what

8

is a pattern of racketeering activity'; and third, a

9

brief discussion of amici's organized crime connection

10

first, the Eighth Circuit's multiple scheme

argument which we submit should be rejected.
First, this Court should reject the Eighth

11
12

Circuit's multiple scheme requirement.

Nowhere in the

13

plain words of the statute, or indeed, in the

14

legislative history, do we find the words "multiple

15

schemes."

16

acts of racketeering activity, not two schemes, just two

17

acts.

18

Indeed, a reading of 1962, the operative portion of the

19

RICO statute, shows the impossibility of the Eighth

20

Circuit's position.

Pattern is defined in statute 1961 as two

There's no multiplicity of schemes involved.

21

1962 forbids a pattern of, forbids a person of

22

acquiring an interest in an enterprise through a pattern

23

of racketeering activity.

24

pattern plus the goal of acquiring an interest in this

25

enterprise.

In other words, there is a

These two together form a single scheme, as

2

do all schemes.

You have a pattern --

QUESTION:

Mr. Reinhardt, at least you take

3

the position that there have to be separate criminal

4

transactions for the pattern.

5

MR. REINHARDT:

6

QUESTION:

7

8
9

Your Honor --

If not schemes, at least separate

transactions.
MR. REINHARDT:

There has to be separate acts,

a pattern of acts is the definition.

Those acts could,

10

in certain limited situations, be part of one

11

transaction, although the word "transaction" is hardly

12

self-defining.

13

QUESTION:

Well, I'm not sure about that.

14

How do we, how do we give meaning to the

15

continuity requirement that Congress clearly intended to

16

have a role in the pattern inquiry?

17

MR. REINHARDT:

Your Honor, I think continuity

18

can be thought of, of course, as a series, as you just

19

pointed out, a number of transactions.

20

believe it also has within it the threat of being a

21

series, and a prime example is the Watchmaker case cited

22

in our brief where some Hell's Angels shot some police

23

officers in one incident.

24

three acts in that case.

25

transactions that could be pointed to, but it was clear

However, I

There were two or perhaps
There was no other acts or

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

that through the Hell's Angels enterprise that these

2

acts were committed so as to allow for the threat of

3

continuity or for continuity.

4

So in certain very limited situations you can

5

have two acts that do allow for a threat of continuity.

6

And if that answers your question --

7

QUESTION:

8
9

Why is it that we require

continuity, in your view?
MR. REINHARDT:

The Congress continually, in

10

its debate and as pointed out in Sedima, said that a

11

pattern is made up of both relatedness and continuity,

12

that that is what a pattern is.

13

QUESTION:

Is not the reason that the concern

14

of the statute is to prohibit activities that have an

15

ongoing potential threat?

16
17
18

MR. REINHARDT:

Your Honor, Your Honor.

fact, it is this criminal enterprise -QUESTION:

Well, isn't the Ninth -- the Eighth

19

Circuit's scheme at least consistent with that?

20

not inconsistent with that, is it?

21

MR. REINHARDT:

22

It's

It is consistent with that,

Your Honor, but it is unduly restrictive in --

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. REINHARDT:

25

In

But it's consistent with that.
Correct.

However, as I

pointed out, it would write out of the law or -- well,
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

let me point out, 1962(b) forbids always only a single

2

scheme.

3

written out of the law 1962(b), if we follow this

4

multiple scheme restriction placed upon the word

5

"pattern" by the Eighth Circuit.

If we need multiple schemes, we would have

Furthermore, even if multiple schemes were not

6
7

a legal impossibility under 1962(b), there is little

8

merit in the concept as, well, Respondent would argue it

9

is a bright line test.

Rather, it becomes a semantical

10

game:

do we in this case have a series of bribes

11

committed by different Bell employees against different

12

commissioners affecting different rates, involving

13

different methods, or do we have one scheme to fix rats?
It's really all in the way that you look at

14
15

it.

The Eighth Circuit, in fact, in the criminal case,

16

Kragness, found multiple schemes where somebody sold two

17

different drugs.

18

been a scheme to sell drugs, and this is consequently of

19

no real assistance in trying to find out what "pattern"

20

means.

I submit that that easily could have

21

If pattern is --

22

QUESTION:

Are there certain crimes that are

23

more susceptible of an inference of continuity and

24

ongoing threat than others?

25

MR. REINHARDT:

Yes, Your Honor.
7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

QUESTION:

1

2

Say, extortion, blackmail, drug

dealing?
MR. REINHARDT:

3

Your Honor, the, I believe

4

acts listed, the 40 or 45 acts listed by Congress are

5

those that they in fact believed carried with it that

6

threat.
QUESTION:

7

Well, I'm not sure.

When we're

8

talking about pattern, would it be feasible, do you

9

think, for this Court to say that you have to show for a

10

RICO civil act that the criminal activity has a threat

11

of ongoing harm?
MR. REINHARDT:

12

Your Honor, I think there are

13

two answers to that that occur to me.

14

Congress spoke of a pattern of activity.

15

pattern of the two acts, pattern of activity, of

16

racketeering activity, racketeering activity being the

17

commission or two or more acts, or at least two acts, it

18

is that pattern that we must look at to find continuity

19

within it, not extraneous from it but within it.

20

act, does it have continuity while the pattern is being

21

committed?

22

The first is that
It is that

Is the

All patterns, or many patterns end when they

23

are discovered.

For example, a criminal enterprise, if

24

you arrest everyone, you end the pattern.

25

going to escape RICO now because they are all in jail?

Are they

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

I don't think that was the purpose of Congress.

It was

2

to look at the pattern during the period of time.

3

as the word "pattern" has that element, we must limit it

4

to the pattern.

Just

And those two elements, relatedness and

5

6

continuity, can be further defined, I believe.

7

Professor Michael Goldsmith, in a Cornell Law Review

8

Journal to be published next month, distributed, I

9

believe, to counsel and the Court, defined "pattern" as

10

two or more predicate acts that are related to each

11

other or to the enterprise, and secondly -QUESTION:

12
13

published next month?
MR. REINHARDT:

14
15

This is a Law Review article to be

QUESTION:

17

MR. REINHARDT:

Well, what value is that to us?

QUESTION:

Well, I'm not going to wait two

months for it.

21

MR. REINHARDT:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

Your Honor, the value I see in

it is that it was a definition that is --

19

20

We received

it in the mail and --

16

18

Yes, Your Honor.

for it.

Excuse me?

I'm not going to wait two months

So what's the value of it?
MR. REINHARDT:

information.

Well, Your Honor, that was my

It was supplied to me.
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

At any rate, the definition is a useful one,

1

2

and I did want to give credit and not be accused of

3

plagiarism, yes, Your Honor, thank you.
He said it was two or more predicate acts that

4
5

are related to each other or the enterprise, and,

6

Justice O'Connor, constitute the series, a threat of

7

series of acts or a series of acts, and that is the

8

continuity aspect.
This, by the way, would be, I believe,

9
10

excellent jury instructions, a simple definition, one

11

that is capable of being understood easily.

12

court wanted, it could toss in the -- the charging court

13

could use the illustration from Title X, which this

14

Court used in Footnote 14 of Sedima, the illustration of

15

various relationships and the fact that they can't be

16

isolated.

17

If the

This definition of Professor Goldsmith's has

18

the dual purpose of being limiting, but it does not

19

distort the clear, broad language of Congress and the

20

instructions that the Act be interpreted liberally.

21

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

22

How does that definition or your proposal

23

apply to a situation where, let's say, there is a

24

kidnapping, and the kidnapper makes a number of phone

25

calls offering to return the captive in exchange for
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

money?

2

and is that a pattern of racketeering activity?

3

Is each one of those phone calls a separate act,

MR. REINHARDT:

Your Honor, given those facts

4

alone, I would answer no, that they do not.

There is

5

no, within that, the facts that you gave me, I do not

6

see a threat of seriality or a threat of continuity.

7

However, if the kidnapper was part of an enterprise that

8

in the past had kidnapped other individuals, then

9

perhaps it would.

You have to look not only at the

10

relationship between the acts, but also to the

11

relationship to the enterprise.

12

QUESTION:

Would each phone call in that

13

situation be prosecutable and punishable by imprisonment

14

for more than one year, each individual phone call?

15

MR. REINHARDT:

It perhaps would, Your Honor,

16

yes, but pattern, Your Honor, carries with it not only

17

the acts and the relatedness of those racketeering acts,

18

but also the continuity, and I don't know if the

19

continuity there would be present.

20

QUESTION:

Are you sure about, are you sure

21

about the answer to that question?

I thought you would

22

just prosecute somebody for the one kidnapping.

23

mean every time they make a separate phone call you can

24

get a different sentence for each?

25

MR. REINHARDT:

You

Your Honor, I am sorry, I was
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

thinking if you were involved in mail fraud or

2

attempting to get monies falsely through the --

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. REINHARDT:

5

6

Right.
-- phone, is that your

predicate?
QUESTION:

Well, you could change it to that

7

situation, fraud through phone calls.

8

call a separate offense?

9

MR. REINHARDT:

10
11

12
13
14
15

16

QUESTION:

Is each phone

Yes, Your Honor.

When only you are asking for -- all

that you're asking for is one payment?
MR. REINHARDT:

I believe that each phone call

could be prosecuted separately, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Does the government generally do

that, do you know?
MR. REINHARDT:

No, they do not, Your Honor,

17

and perhaps that's because there is no threat of

18

continuity there, although --

19

QUESTION:

And you think that what the act

20

refers to, it seems to read that way, is what the

21

government could bring, not what the government normally

22

does bring.

23

MR. REINHARDT:

Well, Your Honor, that is what

24

they speak of when they speak of racketeering acts, but

25

we must -- we are speaking of a pattern of racketeering
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

2

the misuse of the statute.

You must have the

QUESTION:

Well, why isn't that continuity?

MR. REINHARDT:

6

I don't --

It's all surrounding one act.

12

there's only one.

13

It depends on what you consider the

If you consider the act the kidnapping,

MR. REINHARDT:

Your Honor, I am considering

14

the act the kidnapping, I guess, and the surrounding

15

elements of it.

16

Where the --

17

QUESTION:

But where you are, I take it, is

18

that you concede or you propose that there has to be

19

under the statute by its own terms the existence of

20

repeated criminal activity, not just repeated acts.

21

MR. REINHARDT:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

I

Your Honor, yes --

Because the statute uses the terms

differently.
MR. REINHARDT:

If you consider that

there's also the threat of continuity in certain limited

situations.

repetition or the belief that there would be a

repetition.

Continuity has with it not only seeing the

QUESTION:

7

You have to remember that

Does there have to be, then, some

8

sort of different criminal episodes or transactions

9

rather than just isolated acts?
MR. REINHARDT:

10

Your Honor, again that turns

11

to if there is no separate continuity that one can find

12

through the enterprise, then I would say yes, you need

13

separate criminal activity.

in different ways.

I hesitate to use the word

But generally speaking you would
You would have, in our case, we

Those would be different activities.

20

Whether because of lower court desire to --

21

QUESTION:

Hasn't the American Bar Association

22

endorsed the separate criminal episode or transaction

approach?

24

MR. REINHARDT:

Your Honor, I believe the

American Bar Association has accepted or proposed a

2

transaction or not -- or the threat of that activity.

3

would include the threat of that activity.

4

would be eliminating situations such as Watchmaker which

5

clearly should be within the statute.

6

Otherwise we

whether because of lower court desire to

7

judicially amend the statute or confusion, some courts,

including the Eighth Circuit, have ignored the fact

There is no wording in there if multiple

Sedima followed the plain words of the

statute, and I submit that this Court has an opportunity

17

to direct lower courts to do likewise.

18

Thirdly, there was argument presented by the

19

amici in this case attempting to support an organized

20

crime connection requirement, that you have to be

21

typical of organized crime, or the person has to be

22

characteristic of organized crime in order to violate

Now, that means you need at least

It doesn't say that that alone is enough.

11

MR. REINHARDT:

12

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

Couldn't one say that what you need

13

in addition is activity that can reasonably be

14

characterized as racketeering activity; that is to say,

15

the kind of activity that would normally be conducted by

16

organized crime?
MR. REINHARDT:

17

Well, Your Honor, in a way

18

that is what Congress said.

They defined racketeering

19

activity in (1), and they did not add, though, when

argument, trying to limit the person defendant has been

2

rejected, and now the amici are trying to work it in

3

through the word "pattern," through the action word in

4

the statute, not though the subject word.

5

But Footnote 14 in Sedima has already

6

recognized that Congress, and indeed this Court, finds

7

two elements in pattern:

relationship, relatedness and

There was no discussion of and being a

organized crime.

11

Indeed, Justice Scalia, the Congress did know

12

well the principle of including substantial income from

13

crime or expert criminality because they did it in Title

14

X, the next title of this act, where they said if you

15

have a pattern and you have substantial income and you

16

are an expert criminal, then you get enhanced

17

punishment.

19

Clearly those were not included within

Congress well knew that the purview of RICO

20

was beyond organized crime.

The Sedima decision is

replete with examples from the congressional debate, and

22

it's well laid out there.

QUESTION:

Mr. French, we'll hear now from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. FRENCH

5

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. FRENCH:

6
7

8
9

Thank you, Mr. Reinhardt.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
I think in order for this argument to make any
sense, it has to be put into a context, and I think the

10

context is this Court's decision in Sedima v. Imrex.

11

know there are three opinions written in that case, and

12

the three opinions come to quite different conclusions

13

about the issues of the case, but there is a single

14

theme running through all three opinions, and that is

15

concern about the disquieting problem that civil RICO is

16

running far beyond the intent of the Congress to attack

17

organized crime and to prevent its infiltration into

18

legitimate business.

19

Justice Powell in his opinion observed that if

20

Congress had intended to provide a federal forum for

21

plaintiffs for so many common law wrongs, it would at

22

least have discussed it.

23

I

Justice Marshall's dissenting opinion for

24

himself and Justices Brennan, Blackmun and Powell,

25

observed that in criminal application, prosecutorial
19
ALDERSOIM REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

discretion has had a desirable restraining influence in

2

bringing RICO actions, but in the civil application,

3

that desirable restraining influence is absence, and

4

indeed, the reverse is true, the lure of treble damages

5

and reasonable attorneys' fees is bringing about a

6

situation in which we are on the verge of federalizing

7

what has heretofore been state criminal and state common

8

law problem.

9

Justice White's opinion for the Court

10

expressly raised the need for imposing reasonable limits

11

on the scope of RICO by reference to the definition of

12

pattern of racketeering activity.

13

become certainly one of the most celebrated footnotes in

14

recent judicial history, Footnote 14, Justice White

15

pointed out that a pattern --

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. FRENCH:

In what has now

And that was a Court ruling there.
Justice White for the Court

18

pointed out that a pattern requires at least two acts of

19

racketeering activity but does not mean two acts, and

20

also that there are two factors, continuity and

21

relationship, that have to combine to produce a pattern.

22

In a somewhat less celebrated footnote,

23

Footnote 10, that I think is important here, the Court

24

also observed that while the remedial provisions of

25

Section 1964 of the statute may be liberally construed,
20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

at the same time the substantive provisions of 1961 and

2

1962 may legitimately be strictly construed.
The opinion for the Court observed that we

3
4

have come to a point in which private civil RICO actions

5

are being brought almost solely against legitimate

6

businesses rather than organized crime operations, and

7

it concluded this way.

8

its private, civil version, RICO is evolving into

9

something quite different from the original conception

We nonetheless recognize that in

10

of its enactors.

The extraordinary wishes -- pardon me

11

-- the extraordinary uses to which civil RICO has been

12

put appear to be primarily the result of the breadth of

13

the predicate offenses, in particular, the inclusion of

14

wire, mail and securities fraud, and the -QUESTION:

15
16

that Congress passed.

17

MR. FRENCH:

[Inaudible] problem with the law

I think there's a serious problem

18

with it, Your Honor, but I can't do anything about that

19

here.

20

The remainder, the remainder of the Court's

21

remarks relate to something that I think can be dealt

22

with here, and that is the failure of the courts to

23

develop a meaningful concept of pattern.

24
25

Now, that is what has happened.

Following

Sedima, the courts have tried, most of the courts have
21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

tried to react to the opinions, all three opinions

2

written in Sedima, and what they have done is take the

3

invitation in the opinion of the Court to try to develop

4

a meaningful concept of pattern.

5

remarks, in common parlance, two of anything do not

6

generally form a pattern.

7

As Footnote 14

Reaction to Footnote 14 in Sedima and the text

8

of Sedima is plainly what led the Eighth Circuit to the

9

test that it is now using.

The Eighth Circuit has said

10

that on three or four occasions, including in this

11

particular case, and the test that the Eighth Circuit

12

has adopted is that in order to deal with both

13

relationship and continuity, which have to mean two

14

separate things or you wouldn't use two separate words,

15

there has to be evidence or allegations that the

16

defendant has engaged in like activities in the past or

17

other criminal activities elsewhere.

18

I think this is a reasonable attempt to fathom

19

what "pattern" means under RICO, particularly in the

20

light of Sedima.

21

QUESTION:

Well, but, the Eighth Circuit has

22

focused on separate schemes, and that -- it seems to be

23

almost alone in doing that.

24

about separate criminal transactions but not schemes.

25

Other circuits have talked

I think it's a little hard to justify the
22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Eighth Circuit's separate schemes approach, and are you

2

going to address that?
MR. FRENCH:

3
4

I am, Your Honor, and I will do

that now.
Let me divide your question in half, if I may,

5

6

Justice O'Connor.

Contrary to the argument put forward

7

by the Petitioners, the Eighth Circuit is not alone.

8

The Tenth Circuit and the Fourth Circuits each expressly

9

use the word "schemes."

Also, even though the Second

10

and Seventh Circuits do not use the word "schemes," in

11

their recent decisions they are using reasoning and

12

reaching results comparable to the Eighth Circuit.
So the Eighth Circuit is not off on a frolic

13
14

of its own, and it is not true that this case would have

15

been decided differently in any other circuit in America.
QUESTION:

16

You don't think that this, the

17

facts in this case would meet the Seventh Circuit test

18

for separate transactions on the allegations?
MR. FRENCH:

19

20
21

I think, Your Honor, that they

would not.
The Seventh Circuit talks about continuity

22

plus relationship and talks about the predicate acts --

23

I'm reading from page 26 of Respondents' brief, Your

24

Honor, and I'm reading from Medical Emergency Service

25

Associates v. Foulke, which we quote -- "in order for
23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

the predicate acts to be sufficiently continuous to

2

amount to a pattern of racketeering activity,

3

predicate acts must be ongoing over an identified period

4

of time so that they can fairly be viewed as

5

constituting separate transactions, i.e., "transactions

6

somewhat separated in time and place."'"

7

'the

And I believe "transaction," as used by that

8

court, is the same as "scheme" in the Eighth Circuit or

9

"episode" as used by some other court.

10

I agree with Mr. Reinhardt that we oughtn't to

11

get bogged down in the semantics of the particular word,

12

but separate in time and separate in space seems to be

13

what most of the circuits are trying to comprehend here.

14

QUESTION:

Well, doesn't the Eighth Circuit

15

two-scheme rule run headlong into 1962 subpart (b) which

16

says it shall be unlawful for any person through a

17

pattern of racketeering to acquire any interest in the

18

control of an enterprise?

19

scheme, and it's right there in the statute.

20

MR. FRENCH:

That sounds to me like one

I keep reading commentators

21

saying that, Your Honor, but I disagree, and I think

22

it's wrong.

23

I think it's wrong for two reasons.

Let me take an example, Your Honor.

Here I

24

am, John French, age 55, no prior criminal record.

25

decide instead of continuing to practice law as I have

I

been in Minneapolis, I see an opportunity to steal money

2

from a client or to take over a business.

3

act of mail fraud, one act of wire fraud, one act of

4

securities fraud, and I have accomplished my objective.

5

I then retreat once again into the quiet practice of law

6

in Minneapolis.

I commit one

I don't believe that the Congress meant to get

7

8

at me with RICO if that's all I've done.

I mean, after

9

all, I can be prosecuted under the mail fraud statute,

10

under the wire fraud statute, under the securities fraud

11

statute, and the person whom I have cheated can sue me

12

civilly for fraud and for unjust enrichment.
QUESTION:

13

Well, that may be, and your example

14

happens to fit the two-scheme rationale, but that

15

doesn't answer the question that the two-scheme

16

rationale doesn't fit the statute.

17

if we agree with you that in the hypothetical you pose

18

there should be no liability, we need something other

19

than the two-scheme rationale to do it.
MR. FRENCH:

Honor.

It seems to me that

of illegal activities, and I believe I can be prosecuted

3

for all three, going all the way back to the first one,

4

because it is now evident that it is part of a pattern

5

of racketeering activity.

6

I have now committed three separate clusters

Moreover, Your Honor, I think if I can deal

7

with your specific, if you're still concerned about that

8

one opportunity that I took to commit illegal acts, it

9

seems to me that if I could do it with one act of mail

10

fraud, one of wire fraud and one of securities fraud,

11

it's not under RICO for the reasons I stated.

12

have to get complicated about it, if I have to commit

13

and illegal set of acts in Nebraska and another set of

14

illegal acts in Iowa and another set of illegal acts in

15

Minnesota, all of which have to come together in order

16

to produce the illegal result, I may very well, as this

17

Court might conclude, have engaged in a pattern of

18

racketeering activity.

19

But there has to be some way --

happy to take the words used by other courts, I am

perfectly happy to talk about transactions or episodes

hypothetical which included one act of mail fraud, one

act of wire fraud and one act of securities fraud.

But may I ask you,

if there were

two, a series of bribes and a rate increase, another

would satisfy your test?

if that

I believe that my test would be

satisfy my test, but it is not pleaded here.

increase, and I did it again in 1983 and obtained a

15

different kind of rate increase or other benefit from

the commission, and I did it in 1986, and I obtained

17

another rate increase or benefit from the commission, I

think it is possible within a scheme test or a

myself under civil RICO.

clearly come within it under your explanation as I

understand it.

Yes.

Why -- you say it's a minimum

of three?
MR. FRENCH:

2

I don't -- I can't say at a

3

minimum three because the Congress said two, and we're

4

stuck with that also.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. FRENCH:

Then we'll have two.
But as the opinion for the Court

7

said, two in common parlance don't ordinarily add up to

8

any kind of a pattern.

9

very rare case.

So I would think it would be the

Perhaps two coupled with the threat of

10
11

continuing illegal activity which you might infer if you

12

were dealing with an illegal enterprise like La Costa

13

Nostra instead of a public utility that's been serving

14

customers in Minnesota for 75 years, perhaps in that

15

limited situation two would be enough.

16

would be rare.

17

Your Honor, I --

18

QUESTION:

I would think it

Suppose that four or five members

19

of the Costa Nostra take over a very legitimate company

20

and over three or four years engage in a series of acts

21

of bribes to achieve one rate increase.

22

that's precisely what Congress sought to avoid.
MR. FRENCH:

I submit that

But it doesn't fit your test.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

MR. FRENCH:

1

I think it fits my test because I

2

can -- what I see as La Cosa Nostra engaging in illegal

3

conduct, which allows them to take over Northwestern

4

Bell Telephone Company, for example, and then once

5

they've got control of Northwestern Bell Telephone

6

Company, engaging in a series of bribes or other corrupt

7

acts which allows them to obtain more money than they

8

should have received from the Public Utilities

9

Commission, and then moving on to other criminal

10
11

activity.
As I was preparing for this argument, Your

12

Honor, a question such as yours was put to me by one of

13

my co-counsel, and I think the answer is that your

14

hypothetical doesn't reflect the real world.

15

am not supposed to fight a judge's hypothetical, but I

16

have to fight it a little here.

17

1 know I

I know what can be pleaded in a criminal

18

indictment against real criminals.

Yesterday while I

19

was preparing to come here, I read the indictment in

21

charge having to do with pattern of racketeering

22

23

of activities that would satisfy any judge on the Eighth

They were not, Mr. Chief Justice,

I can

20

remember Justice Powell's opinion saying I have to agree

21

with the Court that the issue is not here.

22

wer e.

I wish it

23

Now, perhaps if Sedima came back, the Court

24

would find no pattern of racketeering activity there,

25

but I'm not able to opine on that.
31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

With respect to the present case, there are, I

2

think, two possibilities, and that is that the Court can

3

agree that some variation of scheme or episode or

4

transaction is a correct test, and that as a result, the

5

judgment below should be affirmed.
It is also possible that the Court could

6
7

conclude that one of the other circuits that has

8

suggested a multiple factors test -- and I know I don't

9

have to labor the Court with multiple factors.

It

10

appears in many cases.

We've collected a number of them

11

at page 23 of our memorandum, and to my delight, the

12

Petitioner has cited an excellent multiple factors case

13

that I would be happy to live with in its memorandum.

14

It's the Morgan v. Bank of Waukegan case in the

15

Petitioners' memorandum at page 28.
I believe the Court could say that under a

16
17

multiple factors test, it can also affirm, and the

18

reason I feel so strongly about that is that that's

19

exactly what Judge MacLaughlin did in this case in the

20

district court in Minnesota.

21

argued to Judge MacLaughlin, I argued for dismissal

22

under the Eighth Circuit test, and Judge MacLaughlin so

23

ruled.

When the case was first

24

Petitioners then asked Judge MacLaughlin on

25

rehearing to reconsider what test he would apply, and
32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

having knowledge that he was bound by the Eighth Circuit

2

test, he went on to say, nonetheless, I recognize a

3

multiple factors test is being applied in other

4

circuits, and I will apply it here and see what I

5

conclude.

6

And as Judge MacLaughlin1s second opinion in

7

the Joint Appendix notes, he looked at the duration of

8

criminal activity, the threat of ongoing criminal

9

activity, the presence of single or multiple victims,

10

the independent harmful significance of the alleged

11

predicate acts, and whether the alleged conduct is a

12

regular part of Defendant's business.
And having done all of that, he nonetheless

13
14

found that the complaint failed to state a claim under

15

RICO.
Relating this case, if the Court please, back

16
17

to the concerns expressed in Sedima, I was impressed

18

yesterday again in my reading to read the testimony of

19

Senator McClellan before the House when S. 30 went over

20

for consideration there, and he talked about organized

21

crime quietly sneaking into a business, infiltrating it,

22

using it for corrupt purposes, bilking it of its funds,

23

letting it fall into bankruptcy and dissolving away into

24

the night.

25

activity that both the House and Senate were seeking to

I believe that is the kind of criminal

QUESTION:

2

None of that would be unlawful; I

3

mean, letting it decline into bankruptcy and all of

4

that, I presume, if they want a business that they have

5

acquired to go to seed, I suppose that's all right, but

6

it was the unlawful acquiring that Congress was

7

addressed to, and that brings us back to Judge Kennedy's

8

question which I'm not sure you've answered very

9

satisfactorily.
If you take over an enterprise in the fashion

10
11

you've just described, you're saying it has to be done

12

not by just one criminal enterprise or transaction or

13

grouping or whatever you want to call it, but you need

14

three different ones, or at least two different ones.
MR. FRENCH:

15
16

I'm saying exactly that because

encompass something more than that via RICO, and that's

what makes sense because, as I said earlier, in this

particular case, for example, the Ramsey County attorney

has convened a grand jury which didn't indict.

The Attorney General of Minnesota has an

racketeering activity being conducted in a manner that

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK REINHARDT

19

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

20

MR. REINHARDT:

Thank you, Your Honor.

21

Your Honor, in response to Mr. French's

22

argument that the floodgates of litigation are opened on

23

RICO, I'd like to point out to the Court that there are

24

but 85 RICO cases per month out of 23,000 federal cases

25

being pled today, and that has been double for
36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

approximately two years.
I would also like to point out that the

2
3

Court's decision in Shearson American Express where they

4

subjected RICO to arbitration surely will have a further

5

limitation upon that.

6

argument that you frequently hear bantered about, but I

7

submit that it simply hasn't come to pass.
Secondly, I submit that we will not have every

9

This floodgates argument is an

fraud case in America being brought before the federal

10

judiciary.

This case involved bribery over a period of

11

five years, in 1983, offering employment to a

12

commissioner while still sitting, before a major vote;

13

in 1985, making employment arrangements with a

14

commissioner, passing $30,000 after the commissioner

15

left the court, to an attorney who then deposited it

16

into his account.

17

That attorney then wrote separate checks to the

18

commissioner.

19

commission and, interestingly enough, neglected to

20

mention when required to do so by Minnesota ethical

21

requirements as part of his income, neglected to mention

22

this $30,000 he had just received.

It was listed as attorneys' fees.

The commissioner then got back on the

We don't say it affected one

As this

It is your contention that under

14

paragraph 75 of the complaint, more than one rate

15

proceeding could be referred to?

16

I think that was the section that Mr. French

17

called our attention to.

18

MR. REINHARDT:

Yes, fair and reasonable

19

charges, yes, that there were many charges, that they

20

received in excess of the fair and reasonable charges to

which they would have been allowed.

QUESTION:

were involved.
MR. REINHARDT:

proceedings over this period of time, Your Honor, and in

much material relating to different rate hearings.
Another instance here used by Mr. French as

one of -- well, before, I believe, in response to

5

Justice Kennedy, I mentioned that the continuity has to

6

be within the pattern.

8

That's not what Congress was addressing.

9

addressing the individual, they were addressing the

pattern.
Is there a pattern of racketeering activity,

12

two acts, or at least two acts -- it could be more acts,

13

many acts, but within those acts, is there a

14

relationship and an illustration of continuity, a

15

serialness?

Surely there is in the instant case.

16

QUESTION:

Seriality.

17

MR. REINHARDT:

18

QUESTION:

As Justice Kennedy --

Well, would this case -- this case

19

wouldn't turn out any differently if we held there had

20

to be continuity with reference to the criminal

21

enterprise, would it?

22

MR. REINHARDT:

Your Honor, many courts have

23

said that where you have a legitimate enterprise you

24

never have a problem of continuity because obviously the

25

continuity is ongoing.

I think that really addresses an
