Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Duquesne Light Company and Pennsylvania Power

We'll hear argument

Company are regulated public utilities in the State of
Pennsylvania.

They are obliged by statute to provide

adequate and reasonably continuous electrical service to
their customers.

To fulfill their statutory duty to

serve, Duquesne and Penn Power are required to
anticipate and provide for future energy needs and
demands.
During the 1970s, Duquesne and Penn Power
spent $50 million in planning and preparing for the
construction of four nuclear power plants.

The

22

utilities decided to build these plants in response to
23
24
25

extreme pressure from the Pennsylvania Public Utility
Commission as well as regulatory authorities in

decision to build was made that additional generating
capacity was needed to meet expected demand.
Accordingly, Duquesne and Penn Power spent $50 million
for, among other things, architectural and engineering
services, surveying, construction planning, supplies,
preparation of licensing applications and consulting
fees.
In January 1980, as a result of unforeseen and
unforeseeable changes of circumstances, Duquesne and
Penn Power cancelled the four nuclear plants and did not
proceed with the actual construction.
This case is here on appeal from the Supreme
Court of Pennsylvania because the state has sought to
deny Duquesne and Penn Power any opportunity at all to
recover any portion whatever of the $50 million the
utilities spent in planning for and preparing to build
the four cancelled plants.
QUESTION:

Counsel, the Pennsylvania Supreme

Court, I take it, remanded this case to the Pennsylvania
Public Utilities Commission for further proceedings.
MR. BUSCEMI:

Yes, I think that's correct,

Justice O'Connor.
QUESTION:

Is it -- is it possible that the

Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission could increase

say that the answer to your question is yes.

But I

honestly think that under the decision of the Supreme
Court of Pennsylvania and under its reading of the
statute, Section 1315 of the Pennsylvania Public
Utilities Code, we would not succeed in that effort on
remand.
Indeed, I suspect that my adversary here, the
Consumer Advocate, would say that that is just a way of
accomplishing in one manner what cannot be accomplished
in another, and that the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania
has said on page 14a of the Appendix to the
Jurisdictional Statement this shall not be done in any
way whatsoever.
QUESTION:

21

22

Well, Your Honor, we've

obviously thought about that, and I'd like to be able to

Is there some way that

Well, it wasn't altogether clear to

me, and it was not clear to me whether this then is a
final judgment.

MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, Your Honor, I think that

point in my mind also, whether you have a final judgment

here.
MR. BUSCEMI:

portion of this $50 million of expenses will be

I think we do have a final

You -- you're not interested in

recovering expenses.

You're -- you're -- you're

interested in getting enough money to run a -- a
profitable business whether it's done by computing your
expenses and then giving you enough over that to do so
or whether it's done in some other manner.

What do you

care whether they allow you the return on this nuclear
plant so long as you have a high enough rate of return?
Right?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Oh, I think that's quite

correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

So, what if the state, in light of

the fact that they have now exposed you to a -- a
greater risk than in the past -- that is, you -- you
have to build these plants and you can't get -- get that
thrown into your rate base unless they're used and

useful.

What if the state says in light of that added

risk, we're going to kick up your rate of return from 18
to 25 percent?

Would you have been harmed at all?

MR. BUSCEMI:
that question is no.

In theory I think the answer to
But as the statute that's at issue

here, Section 1315 of the Pennsylvania Public Utilities
Code, has been interpreted by the Supreme Court of
Pennsylvania, that can't happen because the statute, the
critical statutory language, which appears on page 241
of the -- of the Appendix says "nor otherwise included
in the rates charged."

And that is precisely the

language on which our opponents relied in the Supreme
Court of Pennsylvania to say that there was absolutely
nothing that could be done.
QUESTION:

Well, the hypothetical I gave you

does not include the cost of the plant in the rates
charged at all.

It just gives you higher -- higher

return in light of the fact that you are now undergoing
a higher risk.

That is the risk of not being able to

get that included in -- in your rate base if it turns
out not to be used and useful.
MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, Your Honor, I think it's

inescapable that if you accept the proposition that you
are suggesting, the $50 million, the prudent expenses
that were incurred by Duquesne and Penn Power, would be

That's a very broad reading of that

Maybe -- maybe it means that.

I wouldn't --

I wouldn't take it to mean that automatically.
MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, Your Honor, we've been

confronted in this case with a very broad reading of the
statutory language.

As you know, the Public Utility

Commission of Pennsylvania granted 10-year amortization
of the $50 million in expenses that are at issue here.
And that ruling, which appears in Appendices C
and E of the Appendix, was sustained by the Commonwealth
Court of Pennsylvania, both of whom interpreted the
statute not to apply to a situation involving cancelled
plants, but merely to be a timing measure with respect
to the time of recovering the cost of construction work
in progress.
Both the Commission and the Commonwealth Court
said that the statute was only designed to make certain
that the Commission understood that its pre-existing
practice was not to be changed and that with respect to
plants not yet on-line, construction work in progress

was not to be included in rates in any way until such
time as the plants went into service.
But both the Commission and the Commonwealth

3

6

Court thought that the statute did not apply to the
cancelled plant situation or to the plant taken out of
service before the costs incurred in building that plant
had been completely recovered.

they said were not covered by the statute.
But our opponents disagreed and the

9
10

11

Both of those things

Pennsylvania Supreme Court disagreed and said I believe
in no uncertain terms that these expenses were simply
/

12
13
14
15
16

out of the equation, not to be considered, not to be
recovered, to be treated as if they had not been made.
And that is what brings us to this Court today because
there are several key facts about this dispute -- about
this case that, I should say, are not disputed at all.
It's common ground that the utilities'

17
18
19

decision to begin work on these four plants was a
prudent one.
It's also accepted that the $50 million of

20
21

22
23
24
25

expenses were prudently incurred.

There's no

controversy about the amount of money that was actually
spent.
Finally, everyone agrees that the decisions by
the utilities in January 1980 to cancel the plants was

prudent under all the circumstances then prevailing.
So, the fact of the matter is that at every
step along the way, the utilities did just what prudent,
well-managed utilities were supposed to do.

They

behaved just the way the Commission wanted them to
behave and they invested their capital not for some
frivolous purpose, but for the purpose of providing the
electric service to their customers that they must
provide under Pennsylvania law.
These expenses that we're arguing about today
were not wasted in any real sense.

The money had to be

spent to put the utilities in the position to go forward
with construction if the conditions warranted it.
QUESTION:

Well, I think it's -- it's clearly

a frustration to the utility company under the scenario
you paint, but under the Hope Gas case, don't we look at
the bottom line to whether the economic impact overall
can be characterized as confiscatory?
the bottom line?

And isn't that

And how can we look at that bottom

line until we know what happens on remand?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Your Honor, I think the one

thing that we do know about what happens on remand -QUESTION:

Is that the test under Hope Gas?

MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, under Hope Gas, there's no

question that the -10

QUESTION:

You look at the overall effect to

see whether it's confiscatory.
MR. BUSCEMI:

The Supreme Court in that case

used the phrase "end result," a phrase that has been
much used by our opponents.

And the rate order as a

whole must be looked to to see whether it's
"confiscatory."

Of course, that begs the question of

what it means for a rate order to be confiscatory.
The first -- Mr. Justice Harlan back in Smyth
v. Ames said that the question of how you determine
whether a rate order is confiscatory and the necessary
elements in that inquiry will always be what he called
an embarrassing question.

Well, it remains an

embarrassing question today because it is not easy to
know how one tells whether a rate order is or is not
confiscatory.
In our view, this rate order is confiscatory
within the meaning of Hope Natural Gas simply because
$50 million worth of prudently incurred expenses,
expenses incurred for the sole purpose of providing

20
21

electric service, have been ignored, and on remand, they
must continue to be ignored.

22

QUESTION:

But one could read Hope Natural Gas

23
24
25

as saying that if -- considering all of your clients'
investment in the utility business and if the -- if the
11

rate of return allowed on that investment, even after

2

having subtracted this that you say should be included

3

but won't be, if that gives them a reasonable return,

4

that's good enough.
MR. BUSCEMI:

5

6
7

8
9
10
11

can be read that way, but the simple fact of the matter
is that the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, in
setting the rate of return to be permitted on Duquesne
and Penn Power's debt, preferred stock and common
equity, has done so in a way that does not take account
of these expenses.
They have fixed a rate of return that they

19

20
21

22
23

Your Honor, I agree that Hope

believe is a lowest reasonable rate of return wholly
apart from these expenses.

So, we know on the basis of

what has happened in this case that these expenses have
not been taken into account in setting that rate of
return.
QUESTION:

Well, you say then that it's a

matter of constitutional dimension.

Every time a public

utility commission refuses to allow a particular item as
-- on which the utility claims return.
MR. BUSCEMI:

We're saying, Your Honor, that

there is a constitutional component of utility rate
orders, absolutely, that expenses incurred for the
purpose of providing electric service are -- can rise to

talking about an expenditure of $50,000 or some much
lesser sum, and it was -- it was much more debatable as
to whether this sort of thing really should be included
in the capital base, I take it your position would still
be that if you could show that it should have been, then
it's a constitutional question.
MR. BUSCEMI:

20
21

Well, first of all, in this --

just to make sure that we have the facts right, there's
no question here about including this -- these
expenditures in rate base.

This is purely a question of

recovery of expenses, cash operating expenses or other
expenses that were used for electric service.

It's not

a question of the rate base on which your return should
be earned, at least as the case comes to this Court
today.
But, yes, Your Honor, I don't think that the

lots of other practical significance.

MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, as the -- the

Constitution, as this Court's decisions in Natural Gas
Pipeline and other cases make clear, does not fix a
specific rate of return.

It says that a rate of return

may not be confiscatory on the low end and it may not be
so high as to completely overwhelm the consumers'

interest on the other hand so that there is a range.
And I think it's generally accepted that public utility
commissions, particularly in this era of increasing
costs, have attempted to fix utility rates at the lowest
reasonable rate, which is the minimum rate that the
commission believes is necessary to satisfy
constitutional standards.

So, I think that's what's --

that's what's going on.
And I think that with respect to these costs,
we're not in the rate of return issue at all because
here we're only talking about the amortization of the
$50 million in expenses, not the question of whether a
return can be earned on the unamortized balance.

That

has not been litigated in this case.
QUESTION:

But the Chief Justice's point still

remains that no matter how small the excluded amount, if
it is excluded, you think there's a constitutional issue.
MR. BUSCEMI:

Your Honor, I don't think that

anything turns under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments
on the amount of property that has been taken.

I think

very small takings of property can rise to a
constitutional level in -- in the proper circumstances.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Buscemi, it's nice of you to

not ask for it, but -- but -- but really, we shouldn't
kid ourselves.

If you're right that you're entitled to

MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, Your Honor, we come here

this morning with two basic submissions.

The first is

that the Constitution requires a consistent neutral
adherence to one method of fixing rates.
QUESTION:

Are you going to get to the answer

to my question?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Yes, Your Honor.

And the reason that that's relevant is because
I think under that submission whether the public utility
commission chooses the so-called prudent investment
route or the -- some version of the so-called fair value
method, it should permit a return of prudent costs and a
recovery -- and a return on the unrecovered costs.

And

I think that that is inescapable under any consistent
method of regulating utility rates.
QUESTION:

All right.

I -- I just want to be

sure you didn't have some -- different constitutional
theory that it would somehow permit us to -- to require
the state to provide recovery of the investment, but not
recovery on the investment as well.
MR. BUSCEMI:
QUESTION:

Now, the second --

You don't know of any in particular.

line that Justice O'Connor suggested a moment ago and
relies on Hope Natural Gas and the end result principle.
Now, in Hope Natural Gas, it talks about

Well, the second submission,

balancing investor and consumer interests.

It provides

very little guidance for how that balancing is to be
done.

It doesn't address the question that I mentioned

in our first submission, namely, that there should be a
consistent, neutral method of ratemaking.

It simply

says balance and look at the end result.
Well, if -- if that's all that the
Constitution tells us, if that's the entirety of it,
which we don't think it is, but assuming it is, and if
all you have is that injunction in Hope to balance, then
our submission is in this case that balancing didn't
occur because the $50 million in expenses were simply
removed from the equation.

There was no opportunity for

anybody to balance them.
Indeed, we know what happened when the
Commission did balance them.

The Commission balanced --

the administrative law judge who first looked at this
22
23
24
25

balanced, and he said in Appendix H of the -- to the
Jurisdictional Statement I think on balance, when I
balance the investor and consumer interests, you ought

the statute, Your Honor, it simply says that this sort
of expense -- that is, expense incurred in building an
electric generating plant -- may not be included in the
rates charged in any way until the plant is in service.
Now, when that's applied to a cancelled plant as in -in this case, it means that there is no balancing.

It

means that there's -QUESTION:

What if the Commission had said

after thinking this over for a long time and considering
the interests of the consumers and the utility and
balancing things as best we can, we conclude, and then
they say exactly what the legislature said?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, Your Honor, the fact is

that that -- the legislature was not doing that.

I

mean, the legislature was not looking at the rate order
of Duquesne Light Company and Pennsylvania Power
Company, the tariffs that were filed by those companies,
and reviewing them.

That's not what the legislature was

doing or purported to be doing.

regard to the Hope Natural Gas balancing test that if

And that's

what we don't think Hope permits it to do.
QUESTION:

Well, you say then a legislature

has to leave up to its utility commission, which is
presumably almost an agency of the legislature -- it has
to leave to the utility decision -- commission all
decisions as to how each of these factors is to be
brought in.

It can't pass a general legislation that

would bind the commission.
QUESTION:

We're saying in our second

submission with -- under Hope that the entity, whether
it be the legislature or the rate -- or the public
utility commission that sets the rates, must have the
right to take everything into account which we think is
what Hope says.
But I return to what I said in response to
Justice Scalia's question, which is that our first
submission is that under Hope, under Natural Gas
Pipeline, under the earlier decisions of this Court as
well, there has never been a suggestion by the Court
that a ratemaking body, whether it be a state

choose among ratemaking methods so that it produces the
result that it wants to achieve.
This is a case in which the Public Utility

the balance.

occurs?

At each individualized decision, will this be

rate base?

It seems to me that the balancing occurs at

the moment of truth, when the state agency, whatever
state agency it is, determines how much money is this
utility entitled to get from the ratepayers.

And when

that judgment occurs, you can balance.
20

For all we know, whenvthat judgment comes

Therefore, whatever the rate

Now, how do we know that that balancing isn't
going to occur at that stage?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, with all respect, Your

Honor, I think we know it because the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court has told us that it will not occur and it
may not occur under the State law of Pennsylvania.

Well, there are -- there -- the

statutory language appears on page 24L, and the language
of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in interpreting it
appears on page 14a.
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court says Section
1315 "clearly conveys but one meaning:

that the cost of

uncompleted projects shall not only be excluded from the
rate base, but shall not, in any way whatsoever, be
included in the rates charged."

Well, the only way

that the utility obtains revenue is in the rates that it
charges, and the rates that it charges must be the rates

We'll hear now from you, Mr. Popowsky.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRWIN A. POPOWSKY
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. POPOWSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In our view, the question presented in this
appeal is a narrow one.

That question is whether a

public utility has a constitutional right to charge
ratepayers for the cost of any particular investment
even where the denial of recovery of that investment is
not alleged to have any significant impact on the
utility's overall rate level or financial condition.
Our proposed response to that question and the
framework for my argument today is twofold.

First, and

most importantly, I will argue that the Court should
simply reaffirm the Hope Natural Gas decision and
thereby reject the utilities' appeal in this case.

Hope

and the decisions of this Court which followed it have
made it clear that the proper focus of this Court's
review is on the overall end result of the rate order
not upon the individual components of that order and not
upon the methods used to arrive at that result.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Popowsky, what is open to the

23

Utility Commission on remand to do in terms of adjusting
24
25

the rate of return?

MR. POPOWSKY:

Your Honor, if the Commission

finds that the risk of investment -- and I'm talking
about the risk of investment rather than the costs of

these investments -- is increased, then in our view the
Commission is free to raise the rate of return on the
company's overall investment.
What I was going to suggest, Your Honor, is

that the more appropriate course would be the one which
I believe was indicated in Justice Scalia's question
which is what occurred in the State of Ohio; that is, if
as a result of this alleged change in the Pennsylvania
regulatory system -- and we would contend there has been
no change.

We would contend that the used and useful

principle as held by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has
long been in effect long before this statute occurred.
But if there has been an increase in the
company's overall risk, then the company is certainly
free -- and they have been free for the last several
months at least -- to seek a rate increase in which they
would allege that the rate of return that has been
allowed by the Commission is inadequate to meet their
capital needs.

And that, Your Honor, is the difference

between the risk of loss -- I'm sorry -- between
compensation for the loss on these particular
investments and compensation for risk.

-- that -- that the Hope decision -- if the company had
made a proper claim under Hope, if the company had

was confiscatory, then I would argue that the company's
arguments are premature.

22

We can't possibly know what

the final end result of this case will be because it's

but we're just not going to allow that to you this year
because the consumers can't afford it?
And so, you take -- you claim it as a

And the Commission says,

well, look, their overall base is -- figuring on the
rate of return is perfectly okay.

The fact that there

are these individual disallowances doesn't make any
difference even if they're for totally unacceptable
reasons.
MR. POPOWSKY:

Well, Your Honor, the -- the --

However, the

protections under the Constitution under the Due Process
Clause.

The ratemaking methodology cannot be totally

arbitrary.
QUESTION:

Would you say that would open to

review a claim by the utility here that the Commission
had been arbitrary in switching from prudently invested
to use -- used and useful?

No, because that's precisely

Well, I -- I was talking about the

Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision.

That made it very

clear that the constitutional guarantee was limited to a
fair return on property that is being used.

Wasn't that

the whole theory of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
decision?

And they say so specifically at page 21a of

the Appendix.
MR. POPOWSKY:

It's correct, Your Honor.

If

you recall, that -- that case was originally an appeal
brought by the Consumer Advocate's Office under -- under
statutory grounds.

The Consumer Advocate argued that

the -- the allowance was unlawful under state law
grounds. The companies came back and argued, no, we have
a constitutional right to recover these prudently
incurred expenses.

And it's correct.

The -- the

Pennsylvania Supreme Court responded, no, you don't have
that right per se.

And the Pennsylvania Supreme Court

based that on the fact that, in fact, these -- these
projects were not used and useful.
QUESTION:

But -- but that's not consistent

with Hope, is it?
MR. POPOWSKY:

Well, Your Honor, in -- in that

case the Pennsylvania Supreme Court also cited prior
decisions of the -- of that court, including the
Pennsylvania Electric case which came to this Court and

In that case the court did address the Hope

That was a case involving the -- the Three Mile

Island incident and whether a utility could recover the

argument.

The company did not present the

That is, in the Three Mile Island case, the

company clearly presented the -- the Hope end result
test and suggested that the Commission order in that
case violated that test.
In this case the companies argued essentially
that they have a -- as they've argued here is that their
right rests in that individual item of property and the
court responded, no, to the extent that you're arguing
that you have a right to recover the cost of this

First, it is necessary to determine that the

interest.

That's only the first part of the test in

Hope.
Second, one must consider whether the

violation or failure to satisfy those interests is
overcome by some countervailing public and ratepayer
concerns.
Now, the used and useful principle has
traditionally been used as one of those ratepayer
concerns, and in certain cases it may,

in fact, outweigh

the investor interests identified in Hope.
So, what I would suggest, Your Honor,

is that

that is an issue that this Court need not reach because

Pennsylvania -- and our Pennsylvania Supreme Court has

extent that by, for example, ordering a utility to build

would necessarily be included in rates, then that
company would have a stronger claim.

MR. POPOWSKY:

Your Honor, in that case, it's

quite possible that there could be some other protection
to the utility.

For example, it sounds as if there was

almost a contract at that point between the -- the state
and the company.

We're very far from that in this case.

What we have is basically a passive set of regulation
where the utility decides what to build and when to
build and what to cancel and when to cancel.

role of the Commission is to -- is to determine what is

of any particular ratemaking methodology.
It also makes no difference from a

15

Hope recognized that investors have a legitimate

constitutional perspective whether a particular rate
claim involves the return on an investment or the
recovery of that investment.

All that is protected

against in a constitutional sense is that the rates
fixed by the commission be higher than a confiscatory
level.
Hope held that if the overall rate level
cannot be said to be unjust and unreasonable, then
investors have no right to complain and judicial review
by this Court is at an end.

decision.
QUESTION:

Well, you certainly don't argue it

very strenuously in your briefs.
MR. POPOWSKY:

Duquesne and Penn Power

investors were never told by the state that they would
be guaranteed recovery of investments which provide no
service to ratepayers.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court

ruled in this case that the used and useful principle
was established as a matter of state law -- a matter of
state ratemaking policy long before the enactment of the
specific ratemaking provision at issue here.
Neither before nor after Hope, has this Court
ever ruled that a utility has a constitutional right to
charge ratepayers either a return on or a recovery of
non-used and useful investment.

There is, therefore, no

basis upon which the utilities can now claim that their
investors were unaware that there was at least a risk
that non-used and useful investments would continue to
be excluded from the ratemaking equation.
The companies' argument would turn nearly
every rate disallowance in every rate order into a
constitutional issue.

The acceptance of the companies'

22
23
24
25

argument would return this Court and all reviewing
courts to the pre-Hope era where generous rate increases
to financially sound utilities could be attacked as
45
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

2

specific cost item in a constitutionally proscribed

3

manner.

4
5

The states would be unable to apply any other

economic or policy considerations in determining how to
set just and reasonable rates.
The companies' argument also fails to

recognize that ratemaking is an ongoing, dynamic
process.

Duquesne Light Company has had five base rate

cases just during the pendency of the appeals in this
case.

In upholding the Federal Power Commission's order

in the Hope case, the court recognized that this is not
an order for all time and that the doors of the
Commission are open for increased allowances that prove
to be necessary.
Rather than assigning constitutional status to
every dollar of every rate claim of every public utility
in the United States, we would respectfully ask the
Court to reaffirm the Hope decision and deny the
companies' appeal in this case.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

My adversary has concentrated a lot on a
individual item and says that our claim is a claim for

an individual item of investment.

Our claim is a claim

for a constitutional method of setting rates.

If

Pennsylvania -- and my opponent has not denied it -fixes rates of return based on prudent investment and a
reasonable rate of return, the lowest reasonable rate
based on the original cost-prudent investment method,
which is what Pennsylvania does under Section 1311 of
the Public Utility Code, then Pennsylvania must under
the Constitution under the Fifth and the Fourteenth
Amendments permit the recovery of prudent expenses
incurred for the provision of electric service.
If Pennsylvania follows the fair value method,
which is what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court suggests,
Justice Kennedy, on page 21a of the opinion, but which
seems to fly in the face of what the Commission actually
does and what Section 1311 says, then the value of the
used and useful plants and the rate of return on those
plants can be adjusted to take into account expenses
prudently incurred but not producing electricity.
That is not what happens in Pennsylvania.
That's not what happened in this case, and that's why
we're here complaining because the $50 million that Penn

22
23
24
25

Power and Duquesne Light spent will never be recovered.
We will never be able to recover on a Mustang the losses
that we've incurred on an Edsel.
