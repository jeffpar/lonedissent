ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY L. AYERS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

We'll hear argument

MR. AYERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court.

11

Steven Penson was denied his right to counsel on his

12

direct appeal in the Ohio Court of Appeals.

13

The issue in this case is whether

We would submit the facts of this case clearly

14

demonstrate that Mr. Penson's lawyer deserted him with

15

the permission of the Court in a case that presented

16

arguable issues,

I'd first like to give the Court some of the

factual background of the case, and then get into our

legal contentions.

statement certificate with the Court stating that there

2

were no errors requiring reversal, modification, or

3

vacation of his sentence.
He further indicated that he would not file a

4
5

meritless appeal, and he moved to withdraw as counsel.

6

A week later, the Ohio Court of Appeals granted his

7

motion without reviewing the record or without requiring

8

a brief from him.

9

appoint counsel for Mr. Penson upon his request, and

The Court subsequently refused to

10

then, several months later, proceeded to decide the

11

appeal.

12

The Court, in its decision, expressly

13

disagreed with counsel as to whether there were

14

reversible errors in the case.

15

one reversible error, and reversed one of the counts on

16

the indictment.

17

In fact, the Court found

The Court further found that there were

18

several arguable errors as presented in the briefs of

19

the co-defendants.

20

as we submit the Court was required to do, the Court

21

determined that its own error in not appointing counsel

22

was not prejudicial to Mr. Penson, because it had

23

examined the record and the errors submitted by the

24

co-defendants in their briefs.

25

QUESTION:

But instead of appointing counsel,

Of course, the mere fact that the

Court found an error that counsel did not find doesn't

2

show that he was effectively deprived of the assistance

3

of counsel.

4

had filed a brief --

5

MR. AYERS:

6

QUESTION:

I mean, that could have happened if counsel

Well -That raised nine issues all of

7

which the Court rejected but found, the Court might have

8

found on its own a tenth issue, and you wouldn't -MR. AYERS:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

Well -You wouldn't be able to argue in

that case that he was denied effective assistance.
MR. AYERS:

12

Well, I agree with you, Justice

13

Scalia.

14

Penson, the benefit of one of the issues raised by one

15

of the co-defendants, and that was the count that was

16

reversed.

17

Where the Court denied Mr. Penson his

18

appellate right to counsel in this situation was where

19

the Court found arguable issues that this Court has held

20

in --repeatedly, in a number of cases, that the Court in

21

that situation must appoint counsel.

22

QUESTION:

What useful relief can we give Mr.

23

Penson in this case, assuming that everything you say

24

is, have said so far is correct?

25

have a lawyer argue his case again to the Ohio Court of

Appeals? Is there any real chance they would change

2

their mind?
MR. AYERS:

3

Well, that is precisely the relief

4

that we are asking.

5

to argue the appeals in his case.

6

in the reply brief a number of issues that were not

7

raised by co-defendants' counsel.

We have pointed out

Mr. Penson has not had a lawyer to review the

8
9

Mr. Penson has never had a lawyer

case from the perspective of his position in the case.

10

The co-defendants' lawyers were reviewing the case from

11

the perspective of the co-defendants.

12

--he was -- they were reviewing issues relating to the

13

co-defendants.

14

Mr. Penson, and it's a different kind of a

15

representation.

They were not advocating on behalf of

QUESTION:

16

They were review

Do you make any argument here as to

17

the fact that this error was not harmless, or do you say

18

no harmless error standard can be applied?
MR. AYERS:

19

We submit that where counsel was

20

denied, this Court has never applied a harmless error

21

standard.

The counsel didn't perform as he should have.

Well, counsel was effectively

sufficient to satisfy the Constitution, the counsel must

He must provide some

Counsel was effectively absent in this case.

5

6

He did not assist in any way.

7

he didn't do anything.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. AYERS:
QUESTION:

10

He did not file a brief,

You don't know that.
This is a -- this is now -He certainly purported to do

11

something, Counsel, didn't he?

12

MR. AYERS:

13

QUESTION:

I mean --

The only -He represented to the Ohio Supreme

14

Court that he had studied the case, and in his judgment,

15

there were no issues that would justify reversal.

16

his judgment turned out to be wrong.

17

turned out to be wrong if he had filed a brief as well.

18

You can't really say that counsel didn't work on the

19

case.

20

MR. AYERS:

21

QUESTION:

Now,

But it could have

Well -All you know is that counsel,

22

having worked on it, decided, incorrectly, that there

23

was nothing in the case worth arguing.

24
25

MR. AYERS:

Right?

Counsel did state that he

carefully reviewed the record, and that he found no

reversible errors in the case.
He did not say the case was frivolous.

2
3

not file a brief, as this Court has -QUESTION:

4
5

He did

Wasn't the same type of letter in

the Anders case?
MR. AYERS:

6

It was exactly -- it was exactly a

7

no merit letter.

It was a one-sentence statement saying

8

there was no merit to the appeal.
QUESTION:

9

MR. AYERS:

10

Like the Anders letter case?
Exactly.

He did not present

11

anything to the Court to convince the Court that it was

12

a frivolous appeal, and that is the bright line test

13

that this Court has drawn between providing counsel or

14

requiring counsel and not requiring counsel.

15

said in Anders that counsel must be provided in a

16

non-frivolous appeal where there are arguable issues.

This Court

In a frivolous appeal, counsel can withdraw.

17
18

But that is a very narrow exception, and that is only

19

allowed where counsel demonstrates to the Court that

20

it's a non-, that it's a frivolous case.

21

order to do that must present a brief to the Court and

22

must raise issues that might arguably support the

23

appeal.

24

to make that determination as to whether counsel is

25

correct.

But counsel in

And then the Court has to review the brief and

8

Neither of those obligations were met by

1

2

counsel in this case.

3

disagreed with counsel and found arguable issues.

4

Court's decisions in Anders and subsequently, this past

5

term, in McCoy indicate that counsel must be appointed

6

in that situation.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. AYERS:

9

QUESTION:

In fact, that Court expressly
This

Well, counsel was appointed here.
Counsel was appointed.
But he -- he didn't serve the way

10

he ought to have under the Anders rule.

11

a failure to appoint counsel, that's counsel's mistakes.
MR. AYERS:

12

But that's not

Well, of course in the McCoy case,

13

the Court said that count -- once the Court determines

14

that there are arguable issues, counsel must be

15

appointed and must be required to file an Anders brief.

16

Otherwise, the right to counsel becomes illusory.
And you can have a defendant with arguable

17
18

issues not getting his issues presented to the Court.

19

think the bright line test of Anders is a narrow

20

exception to the Douglas v. California right to counsel,

21

and it has to be a narrow exception, and it has to be

22

strictly applied or the right to counsel becomes very

23

illusory.

24

And --

25

QUESTION:

Anders doesn't assure that the
9

I

1

arguable issues will be presented to the Court either.

2

It doesn't -- an Anders brief would not give 100 percent

3

assurance that the good arguable issues would be

4

presented to the Court.

5

files an Anders brief that is simply a bad brief.

6

misses the real issues and decides to address non-issues.

7

MR. AYERS:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. AYERS:

You could have counsel who
He

That's -- it's -- that's possible.
That's possible.
That's possible.

But the Court is

10

still required to look at the brief, and once it reviews

11

the record, it can make that determination as to whether

12

counsel has made an adequate review.

13

arguable issues, and finds that counsel's conclusion

14

that these errors are frivolous is incorrect, then

15

counsel -- the Court at that point is required to

16

appoint counsel to protect the right to counsel and have

17

those issues presented.

18

and I think that the Court made that clear this past

19

term in McCoy, that once an attorney claims that an

20

appeal is frivolous, that two Constitutional concerns

21

must be met.

22

If it finds

That is what Anders requires,

One is that the attorney make a diligent

23

review of the record, and the Court is satisfied that

24

he's made a diligent review of the record for arguable

25

claims; and secondly, that his conclusion is correct.
10
ALDERSOIM REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Neither of those concerns were met in this case.
In fact, the lower court found that there were

2
3

arguable issues.

Under Anders and McCoy, the Court was

4

required to appoint counsel.

5

Mr. Penson being denied counsel.

6

advocate on appeal.

It in effect resulted in
He did not have an

And I think Douglas makes that very clear,

7

8

that that is not only a denial of due process, it's a

9

denial of equal protection.

In a situation where you

10

have arguable issues, a monied defendant can go out and

11

hire a lawyer and obtain the benefit of advocacy in a

12

brief, and have these issues presented to an appellate

13

cour t.
QUESTION:

14

We wouldn't say that Anders was not

15

satisfied if this same attorney -- let's assume this

16

same attorney, instead of filing a letter with the Court

17

saying "I don't see any arguable issues," suppose he

18

said, "Well, I'll write down nine issues that don't seem

19

to me arguable at all."

20

issues that he thought in this case were not worth

21

making -- but he writes them out, and he says, "I'll

22

make them anyway" -- missing three good issues.

23

right?

24

been satisfied?

25

He writes down those nine

What would be the result?

MR. AYERS:

All

Would Anders have

I think not, your Honor, because
11

1

once the Court gets his brief, then the Court is further

2

required to review the record and make sure that his

3

conclusion is correct.

4

then the Court is required to appoint counsel at that

5

point.

6

QUESTION:

Once they identify those issues,

Oh, I see.

What you're arguing in

7

this case is, it's not just the total absence of filing

8

a brief, but rather, whenever a Court finds an arguable

9

issue that is not raised in an Anders brief, it has to

10

appoint new counsel to argue that arguable issue.

11

MR. AYERS:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. AYERS:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. AYERS:

If the Court disagrees -I didn't realize --- with counsel -I see.
-- if the Court disagrees -- I

16

think in most Anders situations, the Court ends up

17

relying upon counsel and accepting counsel's

18

representation.

19

QUESTION:

We've never held that, have we,

20

that you have to -- if the Court disagrees with a no

21

merit presentation in Anders, the Court then has to

22

appoint another counsel?

23

MR. AYERS:

Yes, I think the Court has

24

expressly held that in Anders and McCoy.

The Court said

25

in McCoy, to repeat myself, that if the Court determines
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

that there are arguable issues then the Constitution

2

requires that a lawyer be appointed to argue those

3

issues.

4

in a situation where you've got non-frivolous issues,

5

and Anders draws the line in terms of the right to

6

counsel between frivolous and non-frivolous procedures.

Otherwise, the right to counsel can be denied

QUESTION:

7

Well, did either of those cases

8

involve a situation in which a Court had found -- had

9

found that the no merit statement was wrong, and that

10

there were arguable issues?
MR. AYERS:

11
12

situation?

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. AYERS:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

In either the Anders or McCoy

Yes.
In the -I mean, I was asking about a

holding, not about language in cases.
MR. AYERS:

Yeah.

In the Anders situation,

18

the no merit letter was filed, and the Court agreed that

19

there was no merit to the appeal.

20

finding that the no merit letter was not adequate to

21

protect the defendant's right to due process and the --

Yes, I believe it did hold it.
Do you understand what a holding is?
Yes.
And you say it held that?
The Court did find -Well, but find -- holding means

13

that a particular question is presented for decision,

14

the case turns on that, and the Court adopts one view or

15

another of --

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. AYERS:

That particular procedure

The Court -It wasn't in McCoy?
The -- the issue in McCoy wasn't

23

precisely that.

Right, the issue in McCoy was whether

was frivolous or explain to the Court why.

MR. AYERS:

10
11

Anders -- our position is that

Anders does cover our situation.

5

9

But if Anders covers you, why do

I think you are trying to extend

it, and for no good reason.
MR. AYERS:

12

Our position is that the Ohio

13

Court of Appeals did not comply with the Anders

14

exception.

15

issues, and under the Anders decision, the Court was

16

required to appoint counsel.

It found expressly that there were arguable

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. AYERS:

19

Was that, this, a harmless error?
That's expressly our position, and

I don't want the Court to misunderstand that.
QUESTION:

20

Does the harmless error test apply

21

there, or do you say that there can be no harmless error

22

analysis?

23

MR. AYERS:

Well, this Court did not apply a

24

harmless error test in Anders or in Douglas where the

25

Court had reviewed the record and made that conclusion.
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

We would submit that where there is denial of counsel,

2

this Court has never held that in a harmless error test

3

is applicable.

4

because the right to counsel is so fundamental to not

5

only the trial process but the appellate process also.

6

If counsel was not present and participating

This Court is automatically reversed

7

in the appellate process as an advocate, then the

8

process really hasn't occurred.
QUESTION:

9

Well, but you know, at the trial

10

stage, when you don't have counsel, you -- it's really

11

possible to say, it's hard to say that error is harmless

12

because you don't know what the record would have read

13

like, had you had counsel.

14

would have been in there.

15

the error could be harmless.

You don't know what facts
It's very hard to say that

At the appellate level, though, the facts are

16
17

there.

The record is already there, and you could say

18

that on the basis of this record -- I don't care what

19

appellate counsel you get -- on the basis of this record

20

which was made with counsel, there's no way that a jury

21

could have found anything except that this person was

22

guilty.

23

MR. AYERS:

24

QUESTION:

25

Well, I think that -Isn't that a basic difference

between the two levels?
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

MR. AYERS:

1

I think the problem with that,

2

your Honor, is that it overly burdens the appellate

3

Court to engage in speculation as to what appellate

4

counsel has done.

5

You've got two different rights here -- the

6

right to effective assistance at trial and a right on

7

appeal. You don't know what counsel would have done on

8

appeal. You can review the record to determine if

9

counsel's performance at trial was adequate, but you

10

have to speculate as to what counsel would have done

11

with that record.
Appellate Courts are not in good positions to

12
13

be advocates for defendants.

14

record does not satisfy the advocacy of a lawyer in an

15

appellate Court, because the appellate Court has to

16

speculate as to what would have been raised, the

17

arguments that would have been made, and how the issue

18

would have been decided.

19

shifts the burden from the lawyer to the Court to decide

20

the case --

Exactly, that a defendant on

12

appeal benefits substantially from a lawyer's

13

presentation in a brief of his examination of the

14

record, research of the law, and marshalling of the

15

arguments on his behalf, and that to deny that benefit

16

to an indigent violates the Equal Protection clause, and

17

that's the fundamental denial in this case.
This defendant, because he was indigent, was

18
19

not able to go out and hire a lawyer to present these

20

arguable issues, which the Court of Appeals found, to

the Court. He was stuck with the appellate lawyer, who

that when counsel fails to perform, when he fails to

engage the adversary process, that counsel is

effectively absent. That was the holding of this Court

So nothing was done.

Here, I

12

think, as Justice Scalia points out, the lawyer did

something. You say it was wrong, and grossly inadequate,

but I don't think that's the same thing as just saying

15

that he never -- he wasn't even there.

QUESTION:

If he

MR. AYERS:

Strickland says if it's

You look

Well, Strickland, first of all,

19

applies the prejudice test where you have a performance.

20

Strickland also says that where counsel is denied or is

21

absent or fails to participate in the adversary process,

22

then prejudice must be presumed, because counsel's

23

presence and participation in the adversary process is

24

essential to a reliable result.

25

Here we had no participation by counsel in the

So I think in -- we meet, clearly,

But I think as Justice Marshall has

The Court does not have to apply an

We would submit that the prejudice test

10

applied by the Court of Appeals in this case does not

11

protect the right to counsel.

12

Pennsylvania v. Finley that the Anders procedures were

13

designed specifically to protect the right to counsel,

14

and that necessarily -- it necessarily follows if those

15

procedures are not followed -- if counsel may be allowed

16

to withdraw from non-frivolous cases, then the right to

17

counsel becomes illusory, and indigent defendants are

18

not afforded equality with non-indigents on appeal.

19

That's the fundamental due process violation in this

20

case.

21

This Court held in

It further invites attorneys to abandon

22

appeals. If Courts, or if defense lawyers know that they

23

can be relieved without being required to file an Anders

brief and demonstrate to the Court that an appeal is

25

frivolous, then I think it would invite wholesale

the cornerstones of effective appellant decision making.
There must be an adversary process here, and

counsel did not engage that process.

That's why it

cannot be relied upon as producing a just result in this

case.
We submit that presuming prejudice, if the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK B. ROBINETTE
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

10

MR. ROBINETTE:

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

12

please the Court.

13

out that there's a critical factual distinguishing

14

feature between this case and the Anders case, and

15

that's that in this case, the Court of Appeals found

16

that although the record did contain arguable issues, it

17

also found that those arguable issues had already been

18

raised and decided in the appeals of the co-defendants.

19

I think initially I'd like to point

And I would cite to page 41 in the joint appendix

20

the language of the Court of Appeals, where it said "our

21

full consideration of each may be examined in the

22

decisions rendered in the companion defendants'

23

appeals."

24

factor from the Anders case.

25

So I think that's a critical distinguishing

Another point in Anders was that part of the
23
ALDERSOIM REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

reason for the reversal was that the appellate Court at

2

the State level made no finding of frivolity.

3

not find whether or not there were frivolous issues in

4

the case.

5

It did

I think basically what we're faced with here

6

is a case of ineffective assistance of counsel and not a

7

case of denial of counsel.

8

distinguishable from the Douglas case because in Douglas

9

the defendant had to make a preliminary showing of merit

I think the case is also

10

in order to have counsel appointed in the first place,

11

whereas in this case, counsel was appointed at the

12

outset. As soon as the notice of appeal was filed,

13

counsel was appointed on appeal.

14

There was no outside interference, there was

15

no State interference with Counsel's ability to handle

16

the appeal.

17

least two or three extensions of time to file his brief

18

in the case. There was no argument that there's -- that

19

counsel was laboring under any sort of conflict of

20

interest that would have caused him any problem in his

21

prosecution of the appeal.

22

He had plenty of time.

He received at

I think what the issue boils down to is

23

whether or not an indigent defendant in a criminal

24

appeal has an absolute right to have a brief filed on

25

his behalf, regardless of the merits of the case.
24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

And

1

it's the position of the State of Ohio that he has no

2

such right.

3

QUESTION:

Well, does he have the right --

4

QUESTION:

What does that leave of the Anders

5

rule?

6

undercut the Anders rule in any case where counsel

7

doesn't want to file a brief?

8

where we were before Anders.

9

Is it -- if we rule for you, doesn't that simply

MR. ROBINETTE:

We'll be right back to

Well, I would point out that

10

there's been a lot of criticism of the Anders briefing

11

requirement --

12

QUESTION:

Well, then we should overrule

13

Anders. But it seems to me that what you're saying, in

14

effect, almost does that.

15

MR. ROBINETTE:

I don't think it exactly

16

overrules Anders, because I think a key feature of the

17

Anders decision is the independent review requirement.

18

The Court is required to make an independent review of

19

the record in order to determine whether or not any

20

prejudicial error existed in the record.

21

a key here.

22

QUESTION:

I think that's

Well, but we're talking about the

23

duties of counsel, and Anders does have the

24

administrative convenience of requiring attorneys, at

25

least in the first instance, to identify the arguably
25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

salient issues in the case.

2

that aspect of Anders is completely gone if we rule for

3

you in this case, because counsel just files a letter

4

that he's withdrawn.
MR. ROBINETTE:

5

And it seems to me that

I think counsel is still

6

required to be appointed, and he's still required to

7

review the record.

8

flexibility on behalf of the State appellate Court.

9

Court has a number of options.

I think what's needed is more
The

The Court doesn't have

10

to take counsel at his word.

It can review the record.

11

If it's not satisfied with his review of the record, the

12

Court can say, "Go back and do it again.

13

satisfied with the job you did."

We're not

The Court can refuse to pay counsel if it

15

doesn't think he did an adequate job.

QUESTION:

The Court can

Well, you sure, if you've got those

options.

the question.

22

then having found that there were arguable issues, did

23

it have any duty to appoint counsel to argue them?

24
25

But is there any duty to do anything?

That's

Here it did find arguable issues, and

MR. ROBINETTE:

I don't believe so in this

case, because the arguable issues had already been

that did not let this litigant have a lawyer argue his

view of those issues.

8

agree with that.

9

13

But he did have a lawyer --

QUESTION:

The question is whether he was

entitled to have that done for him.
MR. ROBINETTE:

I don't believe so, under the

circumstances of this case.
QUESTION:

And what is the circumstance that

14

justifies that result?

The fact that somebody else

15

argued them for some other client?

16

MR. ROBINETTE:

I believe if the Court finds

17

arguable issues in the record, and those issues have not

18

been raised and have not been litigated, then I think

19

the Court has the option -- perhaps the duty -- to

20

appoint counsel under Anders.

21

QUESTION:

22
23

It would have --

Well, if you say "duty", then why

didn't it -- then it violated that duty.

I don't believe so in this

That can happen sometimes.
it's possible,

isn't it?

I think, though, there's a key

I think that's

another part of the problem.
QUESTION:

16

Mr. Robinette, why can't you, why

17

can't you answer the question by saying what equal

18

protection requires is that you have a lawyer who exerts

19

his best efforts to find something in your case that

20

will justify reversal on appeal?

21

there's no way of saying that the defendant here didn't

22

get that.

23

MR. ROBINETTE:

24

QUESTION:

25

And you can't say --

Well, I agree with that.

16

MR. ROBINETTE:

I think if we have error

issue in the case, and it's close because of the factual

distinguishing features between this case and the Anders

On your harmless error argument,

are you arguing that we should search the record for

6

MR. ROBINETTE:

I think in the ordinary sense,

the Court would review the record to see if any error -QUESTION:

7

That's your argument, that we

8

should make the harmless error, because the Court of

9

Appeals didn't do that?
MR. ROBINETTE:

10

I -- I -- no, I'm not saying

11

that at all, because I think the Court of Appeals in

12

effect made a finding that there was -QUESTION:

13

They said there was no prejudice,

14

but they didn't say that they could find beyond a

15

reasonable doubt that there was -- that the error was

16

harmless.

17

MR. ROBINETTE:

I think initially this Court

18

has to decide whether or not harmless error analysis is

19

appropriate.

20

21

22

QUESTION:

If they -- if we should decide

that, then what do we do?
MR. ROBINETTE:

I would like to see the Court

23

decide the case.

I don't believe remand is necessary,

24

although the Court may feel that the Court of Appeals

25

did not precisely apply a harmless error test, and you

may remand for that purpose.

That's a closed question

I think in effect they made a finding there

5

sustained in the case was harmless.

And I would like to address briefly some of
the issues that were raised at the eleventh hour -QUESTION:

Well, just before you do that,

11

more burdensome from the Courts?

12

13

Suppose we

Isn't that really administratively

MR. ROBINETTE:

Why not just have them

Well, there's a lot of

14

arguments made that Anders briefs are much more

15

burdensome than requiring a Court appointed counsel just

16

to file a frivolous brief on the merits --

17

QUESTION:

Burdensome to whom?

18

MR. ROBINETTE:

Burdensome to the Courts,

19

burdensome to counsel -- there are four States now that

20

are refusing to follow the Anders briefing procedure.

21

And they follow the so-called Idaho rule, which is

22

discussed in some of the articles mentioned in the

23

amicus brief of the Ohio --

24

QUESTION:

How does that work?

25

MR. ROBINETTE:

-- Defense Lawyers Association.
36

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

The Idaho rule merely says, straightforward,

1

2

that counsel, appointed counsel may not withdraw from an

3

appeal on the ground that it's meritless or frivolous.

4

So, in effect, what those States hold is he must file a

5

frivolous brief.
QUESTION:

6

Well, that's Anders plus.

7

you're talking about Anders minus, and there's a

8

difference.
MR. ROBINETTE:

10

That's true.

But

I -- I think

11

So I think the Idaho procedure is a

12

more, more stringent than Anders, and you're talking

about something that is less.

unethical, because it requires -QUESTION:

Well, the Idaho rule is also

about the Idaho rule?

Well, then, why are we talking
It doesn't apply.

MR. ROBINETTE:

18

That's true, it doesn't apply

here.

But I think there's some policy considerations to

20

be considered.

21

of the problem with the Anders case.

I think the Anders case -- that's part

QUESTION:

22

Well, you're telling me some States

23

have a more strict rule than Anders, and therefore it

24

follows that others should be able to have a less strict

25

rule.

That doesn't seem to me to follow.
37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

MR. ROBINETTE:

1

Well, I think it goes to what

2

Justice Stewart said in his dissenting opinion in

3

Anders. Part of the problem is, there may not be one

4

right answer to cover every situation in the 50 States

5

dealing with court appointed counsel on appeal.

6

think the McCoy case has recognized that, because in

7

McCoy, this Court upheld a Court rule in Wisconsin that

8

went beyond Anders. I think that's a recognition that

9

maybe there's not just one right answer in the situation

10

-- that there may be other ways of handling the

11

situation.

12

QUESTION:

Do you think Anders was an equal

13

protection case, or does it rest on the right to

14

counsel, if there was one?

15

And I

MR. ROBINETTE:

I think it was primarily -- I

16

think there's some overlap there, as the Chief Justice

17

has noted in some opinions, between due process and

18

equal protection.

19

protection case, because they felt like it was not

20

substantial equality in the case, and you had to have

21

substantial equality, although you don't have to have

22

absolute equality.

I think it was primarily an equal

23

But in this case, I think you've got --

24

QUESTION:

25

Well, the real issue then could

never be harmless error, in this case, could it?
38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

It

should be, just as Justice Scalia suggested, it just

don't -- no error at all, no denial of equal protection.

QUESTION:

6

8

10
11
12

Well, then it's an equal protection

case.
MR. ROBINETTE:

there was no equal protection violation.
QUESTION:

Well, that's not an equal

protection case.
MR. ROBINETTE:

14

QUESTION:

16

This case, I think, is

primarily ineffective assistance of counsel, because

13

15

I don't think there

Pardon?

That's not an equal protection

inquiry, is it?
MR. ROBINETTE:

No, it's not.

And effective

assistance is due process.

18

there was no equal protection violation.

19

substantial equality because he had counsel appointed in

20

the first instance, and counsel had the opportunity to

21

review the record.

22

But my argument here is,
He received

That basically the claim is, he just didn't do

23

an adequate job reviewing the record, did not file a

24

brief, and I believe the claim is they think he should

25

have filed a brief.
39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

And I believe the amicus brief filed by the

1

2

ACLU basically advocates a position that they would

rather have a brief filed in every case.

think that's required by the Constitution.

the procedure that was employed in this case satisfied

both due process and equal protection.

however, of making sure that counsel is doing his best,

MR. ROBINETTE:

13

But I don't

At least you make him file

You're referring to the Anders

procedure?

14

QUESTION:

Right.

15

MR. ROBINETTE:

It's a way of assuring that.

16

I'm not so sure how efficient it is, because a lot of

17

counsels don't understand exactly what they have to do

18

to comply with the true Anders brief.
QUESTION:

19

Well, what alternative do you

20

have?

I mean, suppose, suppose we really want to make

21

sure that this requirement we've imposed in Anders is,

22

is not just symbolism -- that we're really not just

23

naming counsel but getting counsel to work on the case?

24

What, what better way would there be except to make them

25

require either an Anders brief or an un-Anders brief, a

MR. ROBINETTE:

QUESTION:

4

MR. ROBINETTE:

Um-hum.

Wouldn't that be a -I agree.

I think part of the

5

problem is, however, a lot of attorneys don't like the

6

Anders briefing procedure, because they feel like it

7

forces them to brief the case against their client.

8

puts a counsel into a very difficult situation, because

9

on the one hand, he's moving the Court to withdraw on

It

10

the grounds that the appeal has no merit, and on the

11

other hand, he's pointing, raising issues in the brief,

12

so-called arguable issues, but he's saying these issues

13

are frivolous.

14

case on that basis, and that puts counsel in a very

15

difficult situation.

So, therefore, he withdraws from the

16

A lot of attorneys, quite frankly, would just

rather file a frivolous brief on the merits and be done

with it.

know, but it's --

That's the easiest thing to do.

QUESTION:

I mean, you either file an Anders brief, a McCoy

the case?
MR. ROBINETTE:

Well, I think again, the

3

problem with requiring that brief on the merits to be

4

filed is it would be unethical in some cases.

5

the independent review requirement where the Court of

6

Appeals independently reviews the record is a way to

7

provide a safeguard --

QUESTION:

I think

It's no safeguard at all.

wouldn't need counsel.

You

I mean, you know, the whole

10

reason you need counsel is because you don't trust an

11

independent review by the Court of Appeals.

12

why you have counsel?

13

MR. ROBINETTE:

Isn't that

I think you have counsel so he

14

can act on client's behalf and raise the issues that he

15

thinks ought to be raised in the case.

16

QUESTION:

And if you had full confidence that

17

the Court of Appeals would find it on its own, you

18

wouldn't require counsel.

19

MR. ROBINETTE:

I think you at least have to

20

require counsel to examine the record, and obviously

21

this court in Anders didn't feel like that was enough.

22

They felt like the Anders brief was required to ensure

23

that factor, but in any event, even with the Anders

24

requirement in place -- and it doesn't appear this Court

25

is ready to do away with the Anders briefing requirement
42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

-- based on my reading of the McCoy decision, I think

2

there still was no Anders violation in this case by the

3

Court of Appeals.
It still boils down, in my view, to a

4
5

situation where it's claimed that council just did a

6

sloppy job and did not brief the case, and should have

7

briefed the case. But I think that ought to be judged on

8

a deficient performance standard, not on presumption of

9

prejudice standard.

It makes no sense to presume

10

prejudice in a case like this when the Court doesn't

11

presume prejudice in many cases of right to counsel

12

violations at trial.
Recently in the Satterwhite case, Satterwhite

13
14

v. Texas, the Court held that harmless error analysis

15

applied to a counsel, right to counsel deprivation in a

16

capital sentencing proceeding.

17

difficulty of measuring prejudice in a case like that is

18

much greater than the difficulty of measuring prejudice

19

on an appeal situation like Anders, where regardless of

20

who the attorney is, he's bound by the same record.

And certainly the

It doesn't matter who you appoint -- you could

21

22

appoint 15 different attorneys.

They've all got to

23

examine the same record.

24

record.

25

to pull their issues out of that record.

They can't go outside the

They can't introduce new evidence.

They've got

And I think

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

that's -- makes prejudice much easier to measure, and I

2

think certainly if the Court does not want to adopt a

3

Strickland type test in a situation like this, certainly

4

harmless error analysis is appropriate in any event.

5

There's no good reason why harmless error analysis would

6

not apply in a case like this.
Briefly, as far as some of the issues that

7
8

were raised in the reply brief -- and I'll refer to

9

pages 9 through 11 of Petitioner's reply brief -- he

10

raised some issues that he says prejudiced Mr. Penson,

11

because they were not raised, and they could have been

12

raised.

13

I would note, also, that Mr. Penson had the

14

same attorney that he has now -- the same office

15

represented him on his discretionary appeal to the Ohio

16

Supreme Court, and basically they were complaining about

17

the job that the Court appointed appellate counsel did

18

in that Court, that they made no effort to raise any of

19

these issues before the Ohio Supreme Court, nor did they

20

make any effort to raise any of these issues at any time

21

until the reply brief was filed in this case.

22

The first thing they refer to is that the

23

trial court erred in convicting and sentencing Penson

24

for both having the weapon under a disability in Count

25

29 of the indictment and the firearms specification that
44
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

accompanied that indictment.

And they claim that that's

2

a violation of Ohio's multiple-count statute, and also a

3

violation of double jeopardy provisions.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. ROBINETTE:

6

The issues they raise go from page 9 through

7

8
9
10

What page is that?
That's on page 9.

page 11.
QUESTION:

It's difficult to see how we could

evaluate some question of Ohio law.
MR. ROBINETTE:

That's true.

That may be one

11

reason why the Court would want a remand on a

12

consideration of those issues.

13

those issues are clearly without merit, and that's why

14

they were not raised until such a late time in this

15

proceeding.

16

However, I think that

There's Ohio case law that holds that those

17

statutes are not one and the same statute, and they do

18

not violate the multiple count statute.

19
20
21

22
23

QUESTION:

Well, were these issues decided in

a State Court?
MR. ROBINETTE:

No, because they were never

raised in the State Court.

to consider those questions?

MR.

1

ROBINETTE:

Yes .

And I think Petitioner's

2

argument is that he was deprived of the opportunity to

3

have those issues decided.

4

issues could have been raised under the guise of an

5

ineffective assistance of counsel claim to the Ohio

6

Supreme Court,

7

often used to get around the ordinary rule that the Ohio

8

Supreme Court will not rule on an issue that wasn't

9

raised in the lower court.

But my position is,

that's often done.

That's a way that's

is he didn't have a lawyer.
MR. ROBINETTE:

the argument.

You could come up with any number of

20

issues that could have been raised in hindsight.
QUESTION:

21

is,

Well,

that's not your answer.

Your

22

answer

it's not because he didn't have a lawyer, but

23

because he did have a lawyer who knew Ohio law, and knew

24

that since they hadn't been raised in the trial court,

25

they couldn't be raised on appeal.

2

MR. ROBINETTE:

Some of these issues could

have been raised on appeal, I think, because --

3

QUESTION:

Oh, some could?

4

MR. ROBINETTE:

It's a judgment call whether

5

or not the lawyer thinks they have any merit.

6

these issues had already been decided by the same

7

appellate Court adversely to the position that

8

Petitioner now takes.

9

Some of

I mean, is the lawyer obligated to raise an

10

issue that's already been decided by the appellate Court

11

in his district?

12

13
14

I don't think so.

QUESTION:

I don't see how we can decide that,

when there was no lawyer there.
MR. ROBINETTE:

Again, we get back to the

15

situation where a lawyer was appointed in the first

16

instance, and he made a judgment call not to raise

17

certain issues.

19

20

QUESTION:

Douglas case, that's where we get.

He's -- you haven't touched it.
MR. ROBINETTE:

He may not have done a lot,

that's for sure.

But he was appointed.

I don't think

22

you can blame the appellate Court for the lawyer's,

23

perhaps poor, performance in the case.

24

situation where you have to judge the lawyer's

25

performance, because I don't think the appellate Court

I think it's a

47
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

has violated Mr. Penson's rights.
QUESTION:

2

Well, what should an appellate

3

Court do, if midway through an appeal, it's perfectly

4

obvious that the counsel they appointed is a, is a, if

5

he isn't a nitwit, he's pretty close to it, and there's

6

just not going to be any effective assistance?
MR. ROBINETTE:

7

If the Court comes to that

8

conclusion midway through the appeal, they always have

9

the option to dismiss this attorney from the case and

10

appoint another attorney.
QUESTION:

11

There's no problem with that.

Well, didn't they here come to the

12

conclusion that the lawyer really didn't, didn't do what

13

he was supposed to?
MR. ROBINETTE:

14

I don't think they were

15

particularly pleased with the job that he did.

16

think the viewpoint of the Court was there was no

17

prejudice from what he did, based upon the issues raised

18

in the other cases and its own review of the record, and

19

to appoint another attorney at that point in time to

20

review the same record would have been a fruitless

21

exercise.

position. That's basically a no prejudice, harmless

correct in that determination.

Is counsel paid in Ohio for

representing people on appeal?
MR. ROBINETTE:

Yes, yes.

I'm not sure what

the pay schedule is, but they are appointed by the Court

11

and they are paid by the State.

12

Now,

in this case, maybe he should not have

been paid, but as it's been pointed out, it's hard to

judge from what appears in the record exactly how much

of their hours in the case.

I don't know how many hours he claimed to have put in,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY L. AYRES

7

MR. AYERS:

I'm shocked that counsel for the

8

State of Ohio describes this Court's decision in Douglas

9

v. California as a windfall.

I think the right to

10

counsel on appeal, like the right to counsel at trial,

11

is much more fundamental than that.
This Court indicated in Evitts v. Lucey that

12
13

counsel's presence is essential to adequate and

14

effective review.

15

windfall.

16

It certainly cannot be described as a

QUESTION:

So do you think the -- do you think

17

that our decisions, the Court's decisions have now

18

clearly come out to require counsel on appeal, not as a

19

matter of equal protection, but as a matter of some

20

other provision in the Constitution?

21

MR. AYERS:

I think as a matter of due

22

process, equal protection, of course guarantee the right

23

to counsel, but the right to effective assistance is

24

required with the Evitts decisions.

25

cannot just be present.

The counsel just

He must engage in an effective

performance.

QUESTION:

This is not a matter of due process?

3

MR. AYERS:

Well, the Court did rely upon the

4

due process clause in the Evitts decision.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. AYERS:

That was --

Not the equal protection clause?
No.

That was the only issue

7

presented by the record on the appeal in Evitts, so that

8

was the only Constitutional provision relied upon by the

9

Court, the due process clause.
But Evitts made it very clear that an attorney

10
11

process.

16

Evitts specifically

That denies due

Well, that's exactly what occurred here.

And

17

for counsel for the State of Ohio to say that it's a

18

windfall just goes against a whole line of decisions,

19

beginning with Douglas and ending with McCoy, four or

20

five decisions in between.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Ayers, can I ask you a question

22

about your opponent's suggestion that one possible

23

disposition of this case would be to remand it to the

24

Ohio Court of Appeals to decide whether there would be

25

error, assuming it was error -- was harmless or not?

If

1

we should do that, would your client be entitled to have

2

a lawyer represent him in the proceedings before the

3

Ohio Court of Appeals?

4

MR. AYERS:

Well, of course.

He's -- our

5

position is, he should have a new appeal which he didn't

6

get in the first place.

7

remand the proceeding, certainly he should have -- if

8

it's back to the first appeal level, he should certainly

9

have a lawyer.

10

If the Court were going to

That's what Douglas requires.

QUESTION:

But their disposition would give

11

him a lawyer, as I see it now.

12

would be any more expensive than the other.

13

know whether it makes any difference whether we would do

14

that, and let your client then have a lawyer to argue,

15

file a brief, or to reverse, since they appoint a lawyer

16

on the appeal.

17

MR. AYERS:

And I'm not sure one
I don't

Well, I think that points up the

18

whole problem with this process, your Honor.

If the

19

Court of Appeals had applied Anders, the crisp, bright

20

line rule, we wouldn't be here.

22

had -- I'm sorry, if Mr. Penson had gotten his appeal in

the Ohio Court of Appeals, we wouldn't be here.

be here on some other issue, but we wouldn't be here on

the denial of right to counsel.

This simple case has

when counsel is denied and the Court has to engage in a

QUESTION:

here if you would have won, would you, counsel?

MR. AYERS:

6

QUESTION:

7

Well, of course.
And how do you know you wouldn't be

here if -- if

MR. AYERS:

9

QUESTION:

10

Well, you certainly wouldn't be

Well, not on this issue -If counsel has been appointed and

you are?

11

MR. AYERS:

Not on this issue, your Honor.

12

And I think that that points up the problem

13

with the denial of counsel.

14

in a speculative exercise to figure out what counsel

15

would have done, or should have done, and would it have

16

-- what he would have argued to the appellate Court,

17

what the appellate Court would have decided -- and this

18

Court said in Strickland, when counsel is denied, it

19

really isn't worth the cost of trying to figure out the

20

effect of the denial of counsel.

QUESTION:

May I ask another -I think that's the problem with

applying a prejudice test in this situation.
QUESTION:

May I ask another question about

the practice in Ohio in appointed cases?

Does the

lawyer get paid so much per case or so much per hour in

2

a case of this kind, the appointed counsel?

3
4

MR. AYERS:

There are maximums established by

the County, and the lawyer gets paid so much an hour.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. AYERS:

7

QUESTION:

So much an hour.
But -- yes.
So that he wouldn't get the same

8

amount for filing this, this Anders letter as he would

9

if he'd filed a brief?

10

MR. AYERS:

11

QUESTION:

I hope not.
Yeah.

Well, of course, if he spent

12

the same amount of time on it, though, I suppose he

13

would. If he put in an hourly statement, showed --

14
15

MR. AYERS:

If I were on the appellate Court,

he wouldn't get anything.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. AYERS:

Yeah, I think counsel did --

Yeah.
-- did nothing other than review

18

the record in this case, and didn't do his job as he is

19

required Constitutionally to do.

20

its job in requiring him to file an advocate's brief

21

where there were arguable issues.

22

The Court did not do

This Court made it very clear in McCoy that

23

where there are arguable issues, the attorney cannot

24

serve the client's interest unless he files an

25

advocate's brief. That did not occur here, and for the
54
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

State to argue that Mr. Penson's right to counsel was

2

satisfied by a co-defendant's lawyer is just totally

3

inadequate.

4

When you're reviewing a record as an advocate,

5

as an appellate lawyer, representing a client, you first

6

of all consult with your client, and then you review the

7

record with a view to seeing if there were errors in the

8

record that pertained to him.

9

the other co-defendants.

You're not thinking about

You're looking for errors that

10

specifically pertain to him, and then you're filing an

11

advocate's brief advocating on his behalf those

12

particular errors.
Mr. Penson did not get that.

13

This Court made

14

it very clear in Ross that every defendant must be

15

afforded an adequate opportunity to participate in his

16

appeal, and to have meaningful access to the appellate

17

process.

That was completely denied here.
One further point that I would like to address

18
19

is that the State argues that we should apply a

20

prejudice test here because we have a performance.

21

Evitts again points out that counsel, in order to be

22

effective, must engage in a performance.

23

does not file a brief on appeal, he's engaged in

24

nothing.

25

talks to all the witnesses but doesn't come into the

When counsel

It's like a lawyer at trial who goes out and

courtroom and represent his client.
A brief on an appeal is the primary tool by

2
3

which the appellate advocate acts as a sword to convince

4

the Court that error has occurred.

5

effectively absent in this case.

6

in the appeal.
QUESTION:

7

The attorney was
He did not participate

What if paid counsel spends a lot

8

of time examining the case, finds that there's nothing

9

to it on appeal?

He tells his client, "I'm sorry, you

10

have no basis for an appeal."

11

Could he send him a bill for that time?
MR. AYERS:

12

Has he done his job?

Well, that's between he and his

3

client, I suppose.

But the point is, with respect to

4

your question, Justice Scalia, is that client can go to

5

another lawyer and ask him, and that lawyer may find

6

issues.
The monied defendant can get a lawyer to

7
8

present issues, especially if they're arguable issues as

9

in this case.

Mr. Penson could not do that.

He was too

20

poor, and he was denied the equal protection which

21

Douglas v. California gives him.
