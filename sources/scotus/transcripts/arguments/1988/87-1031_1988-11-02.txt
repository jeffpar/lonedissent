ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN W. GRESHAM

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GRESHAM:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In this case the Court must determine whether

12
13

it will apply its longstanding practice of borrowing the

14

analogous State statute of limitations and apply that to

15

a free speech claim under Title I of the LMRDA, or

16

whether it will apply the narrow exception to that

17

normal borrowing procedure which was described in

18

DelCostello v. Teamsters, and in applying that

19

exception, then select the six-months' limitation period

20

of 10(b) of the NLRA.
The facts in this case indicate that it is a

prototypical Title I claim.

union member for protesting both the improper use of

24

union funds and for opposing a dues increase in the

25

local.

What are these facts?

1

Well, Mr. Reed was the

2

treasurer of his local.

3

chairman was obtaining funds that he was not entitled

4

to. He was getting funds for the local for time for

5

which the company had paid him.

6

repayment of this money from the general chairman.

9

he opposed the general chairman's efforts to get a dues
increase in the local.
Reed went so far as to tell the auditor from

10
11
12
13
14

the international about the general chairman's double
dipping, getting union funds for work where he'd been
paid by the company.

What was the auditor's response?

He didn't have time to think about that sort of matter.
The auditor, however, then demanded that Reed

Mr. Reed demanded

response?

The problem with that

There had never been a prior approval

requirement.
At the same time that Mr. Reed was being
required to repay this money, one of the general

chairman's subordinates, the vice general chairman, went

2

to another dissident union member, told him they could

get him too, but at that point, they were just after Mr.

4

Reed.

5

this other union member might want to withdraw from the

What did Mr. Reed do?

It was equal to about six months of the

small stipend that he received for his usual duties as
treasurer and he protested to the international
president, Mr. Hardin.

And Mr. Hardin denied the

protest.
Mr. Reed then tried to apply the same prior

He paid back the money

approval policy to reimbursement requests by other local
members.

He was chastised by the international

president and required to pay the money in spite of the
fact there was no prior approval.
This discriminatory treatment ultimately led
Mr. Reed to file this claim, and the Title I claim, we
argue to this Court, is not one which necessitates
departure from the longstanding practice of this Court
in labor law, as the Court said in DelCostello, as
otherwise of borrowing the appropriate state statute of
limitations.

The reason that there is no need for such

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

3

a departure is that the conditions present in
DelCostello are not present in this case.
The claim in DelCostello that hybrid duty of

4

fair representation, Section 301 claim under Taft

5

Hartley, unlike the Title I claim, which is simply a

6

straightforward claim, a union member suing union for

7

violation of rights under Title I, this DFR 301 claim

8
9

directly challenged the collective bargaining agreement.
And the private resolution of disputes under that

10

agreement which are at, as this Court indicated in

11

DelCostello, at the center of the labor law policy

12

passed by Congress in the NLRA and Taft Hartley.

Indeed, I think the hybrid DFR 301 action that
was brought in DelCostello is perhaps the most direct
challenge that can be made to that consensual process.
What is the worker asking there?

He's asking the

federal court to set aside the private dispute
resolution.
His basis and to get to court and to avoid the
requirements of exhaustion and the way the court would
normally look at the arbitration, what must he do?

He

must show that the union has failed to properly
represent him.

Not only that, he must show that the

arbitrator made the wrong decision and, in fact, he was
entitled to relief.

He has a very heavy incentive to

sue both, the union and the employer, for otherwise he
will not collect his full measure of damages.
As this Court indicated in DelCostello, the -it spoke to its concern because there was no doubt that
there was an unquestioned impact by the hybrid DFR 301
action on the consensual and private dispute resolutions
process, and I think that it was that fact that drove
the Court to apply the exception which it did in
DelCostello.
This Title I claim, however, does not involve
a work place dispute as did DelCostello, DelCostello
being that situation where Mr. DelCostello had been
terminated from his job.

The other plaintiffs in

DelCostello had varying disputes over the work place,
layoffs, poor job assignments.

It does not implicate

the collective bargaining agreement.

The employer is

not a party.
Rather, the claim is very straightforward.
The union member asserts that the union has violated his
rights under the union members' bill of rights, Title I
of the LMRDA.

This bill of rights was promulgated

because of policy considerations present in neither the
NLRA nor the LMRDA.

Congress, at the time of the

passage of Title I, had become aware that some unions
were acting in a very autocratic fashion and, indeed,

some unions were corrupt.
Congress was casting for a way to deal with
these problems.

One would have been far more direct

government interference, but Senator McClellan rejected
that approach when he put forward the labor union
members' bill of rights.

His approach was by granting

union members the rights of free speech, of assembly, of
due process, of participation in elections, of the vote,
that by applying the very model which had worked so well
for this country in the relationship between citizen and
government to the relationship between union member and
union, that the democratic process itself would correct
the abuses which Congress had found.
I think you can see how wide Congress sought
to sweep and that it applied Title I not just to unions
that are governed by the NLRA or unions that are
governed by the Railway Labor Act but, indeed, to all
unions, even the agricultural unions which are not
subject to the other federal labor policies.
At the time of the passage of the LMRDA,
commentators realized that this democratic process which
Congress sought to establish was a fragile one.

As

Archibald Cox recognized in his- article in the Michigan
23

24

25

Law Review, most men are reluctant to risk the cost
incurred in vindicating those intangible rights that
8

were set out in Title I, and those who sued under Title

2

I ran, in Mr. Cox' words, enormous risk for they were

3

going up against the power, the entrenched power of the

4
5

8

union.
But as this Court has noted in Hall v. Cole,
the principal beneficiary of these Title I actions is
not the individual union member, it is the union
membership as a whole, it is the general public interest
that labor unions in this country be run
democratically.

Indeed, as Justice Marshall in

rejecting a six-months' limitation in a case involving
similar rights asserted against the government noted,
these are the very claims which belong in court.

They

do not or should not be curtailed by a short statute of
t

15

limitation.
Secondly, what about the practicalities of the
litigation because that again was a factor which
concerned this Court in DelCostello and again drove it
away from the usual practice?

I think the

practicalities of this litigation indicate that there is
a need for the longer state statute of limitations, the
analogous statute in this case being the personal injury
statute in North Carolina.
QUESTION:

And how long is that, Mr. Gresham?

MR. GRESHAM:

That is three years under

GSl-51-5.

It is a general statute of limitation for

personal injury.
That -- that longer state statute of
limitations is the more appropriate vehicle, again
quoting the language in DelCostello, for this bit of
interstitial lawmaking.

As both Archibald Cox

recognized in his article and Judge Coffen recognized in
his decision in Doty v. Sewall where he applied the
normal practice and rejected any exception, there are
good reasons for a union member who has suffered
internal union harassment not to come forward
immediately.

After all, he still has his job.

This is not a work place dispute.
dispute over his rights in the union.

It's a

Maybe if the

union member keeps quiet, the problem will go away, or
maybe someone else will step forward.

After all, I

think the union member must always keep in mind those in
power, as Judge Coffen indicated, do have long memories.
Yet, if the union membership as a whole and
the public interest is to be served, the union member
must step forward, and when he does, what must he do?
He must in most cases find and pay a lawyer.
must the lawyer do?

And what

The lawyer must investigate.

The

lawyer -- the lawyer must ensure himself that the facts
are there sufficient to meet any challenge under Rule 11

That is different from the situation in

He was casting about for one more

back his job and his wages.
Additionally I would note that there were
practicalities in the DelCostello litigation after the
case was filed.

It's a problem of the two different

actions with the two different conceptual underpinnings.
In the issue of damages, as this Court has noted, one
collects damages from the union only to the extent that
the union has created damages over and above the actions
of the employer.
If you apply the short statute of limitations

The DelCostello plaintiff, Mr.

in DelCostello, the 90-day arbitration period, to the
action against the employer, you've truncated the
damages.

If you apply the long statute, the two-year

statute of limitations that this Court found was the
most analogous statute to the -- for the duty of fair
representation claim, you again run head on into the
problems of the effect and interference that that long
statute of limitations would have on the private dispute
resolution process that is at the heart of the
11

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

collective bargaining agreement, again, not something
that you have in this case.
And the difference, the difference in the

me to a third point.
good state analogy.

15

19

20
21

22

25

The Court thought perhaps after

wrestling with the issue in Mrtchell, 90 days, the very
short statute of limitations for arbitration in most
states -- some states had 60.

I think some had perhaps

a bit more -- was not sufficient.

It did not allow the

union members sufficient time to come forward if you did
have a legitimate grievance.
And the two-year malpractice statute had no --

13
14

In DelCostello there was simply no

no connection at all with the action against the
employer.

And again, if it were implied -- if it were

applied, it would again cause that disturbance with the
underlying collective bargaining.
I would note that that interference is set
forth in the NLRA and in the Taft Hartley Act.

And in

the DelCostello case, those were the acts which gave Mr.
DelCostello his claim, the act or the action inferred
against the union in this Court and the duty of fair
representation and the specific statutory right under
Section 301.

Those statutes brought forward the

problem, the labor policies that were being interfered
12

with, at the same time that they granted the right.

There is no such problem with the analogous three-year

statute of limitations here.

This Court's analogies I think in Wilson and
Goodman in selecting the general personal injury statute
for the federal rights which again are the rights of a
citizen, those intangible rights to vote, to participate
in the elections, for due process -- this Court quoted,
as had the Fourth Circuit in a pre-DelCostello decision
in which they also applied the three-year personal
injury statute to Title I actions -- quoted -- and I
think the Court's word -- the persuasive analogy of Kent
v. Alman, that indeed actions such of this are personal
rights and that violations of those create a personal
injury such that the appropriate statute is the general
personal injury limitations period.
We note that although this Court was faced in
DelCostello with the lack of a viable state statute of
limitations, the potential for the direct interference
with the collective bargaining process and the private
dispute resolution thereunder and the practicalities of
the litigation involved, it still was hesitant to move
away from its traditional policy and only did so because
it had a good analogy, Section 10(b) of the NLRA.
In this case, I do not think the Court has to
13

look to see if Section 10(b)

11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21

is analogous, I think the

Court will find that that close analogy -- clearly a
closer analogy is I believe the language of the Court in
setting out its standards in DelCostello -- is not
present here.
First of all, what did the Court find with

9
10

But should the Court -- should the Court

regard to the DFR hybrid action and the unfair labor
practice statute of limitations?

They found, if they

took the NLRB's position, a complete overlap of those
claims.

The Court said, not -- not yet ready to decide

that point, we at least understand that there is a
substantial overlap.

Yet, with the Title I claim, which

involves the internal union procedures used to violate
the rights of the union member, both the NLRB and this
Court have consistently held that those internal union
procedures and that discipline, no matter what the
motive, is excluded from the reach of the unfair labor
practice.
As recently as Pattern Makers' I think in

22

1985, this Court reaffirmed that the union in its
23
24
25

internal procedures was not subject to an unfair labor
practice. Indeed, the amicus for the respondent, the
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

2

4

AFL-CIO in that case, argued that that exception reached
so broadly that the NLRB could not reach the situation
where the union tried to discipline members that
resigned.
I would note that that position is entirely

5

6
7

8
9
10
11

opposite from the one that the AFL-CIO takes in its
amicus brief here today where they talk of the
substantial overlap of the two claims.

a shift of that major proportion is such as to make the
argument of the AFL-CIO what they term in their brief
"content-free."
Additionally, the policy considerations of

12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19

20

Section 10(b), as this Court noted in DelCostello, were
specifically attuned to that balance which the Court was
trying to find in DelCostello, the balance between the
worker, the worker with the work place dispute, trying
to assert his claim and the need for speedy resolution.
The Court found that that was what Section 10(b) was
attuned to and that that's what was at issue in
DelCostello.
That is not what is at issue in this case.

21

22
23
24
25

Indeed, I think

There is no work place dispute.

There is no dispute

over the collective bargaining agreement.

There is no

effort to set aside that private resolution of the
dispute.
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

Thus, Section 10(b)

appropriate analogy for this case.

13
14

16
17
18
19

20
21

Even if the Court

were to determine that given the practicalities of the
litigation, given the federal policies, given the
available limitations, it had to look elsewhere, it is
not a clearly more appropriate statute of limitations.
Rather, it is an action by a member of a private
organization to protect his federally protected rights
and to ensure that his organization functions
democratically.
DelCostello in some way does apply to this

11
12

is simply not an

case.

It applies in its directive that the prior

practice of borrowing state statute of limitations is to
continue in labor law as elsewhere unless the stringent
conditions of DelCostello have been met.

They have not

been met here, and the three-year statute of North
Carolina is to apply.
I will reserve my additional time for
response, if I may.

No, Your Honor.

limitations?

That is correct, Your Honor.

Additionally, the Title V claim that the
Plaintiff brought in the district court below was
dismissed as procedurally defective.

When the matter

was granted interlocutory review on the DelCostello
statute of limitations question, there was no
cross-appeal with regard to the Title V claim that had
been dismissed by the district court.

allegations set forth in the complaint are true.

MR. MILLER:

The

only reason that I mentioned it was that the -- there
were counter-affidavits that were filed in opposition to
the motion for summary judgment.

But I recognize, Your

Honor, everything must be construed in favor of my
opponent since we were the moving party with regard to
limitations grounds.
The Petitioner, as well as the United States,
and the other amici supporting the Petitioner's
position, would have this Court narrowly construe its
decision in DelCostello out of existence by failing to
give effect to all that was said in that decision and by
cutting too finely the language chosen to be analyzed.
In DelCostello, while this Court noted the
general rule that in the absence of a specific statute
of limitations in federal statutory law, it is not to be
assumed that Congress intended that there be no statute
of limitations, but rather to borrow from some other
source, usually state law.

It further noted that state

legislatures do not devise their statutory statutes of
limitations with -- with national interests in mind.
In so doing, this Court noted that United Auto

22

Workers v. Hoosier Cardinal, the bench mark that we're
23

25

using here for the normal rule of application of a state
statute of limitations, involved a straight Section 301

that the ordinary state statute of limitations with
regard to contracts was applied.

We learned later that

the reason the six-year oral contract statute was
applied was because this Court felt the 15-year written
statute of limitations on written contracts did not
provide sufficiently for the rapid resolution of labor
disputes.

Labor disputes were spoken of generically.
DelCostello did, in fact, involve a hybrid

suit, that is, a suit by the member against his employer
for breach of the contract and a suit against his union
for breach of the duty of fair representation implied in
the law owing to the exclusive representative status
that the organization has.
This Court found that, obviously, those claims
were inextricably interdependent because of its previous
decisions in Vaca v. Sipes and Hines v. Anchor Motor
Freight for that reason, deciding that there could not
be one statute applicable to the employer without a
comparable statute being applicable to the union in the
case if the party were to be afforded complete relief.
The Court noted that these difficulties cannot
be tolerated in the Court's view where there is a

In DelCostello, it was very important to this

Court that the National Labor Relations Board has
consistently found all breaches of the duty of fair
representation to constitute unfair labor practices,
thus triggering the operation of Section 10(b) with
regard to any charge filed with the general counsel at
the Board.
However, the Petitioner, as well as the amici
on that side of argument, totally ignore in their
briefing the fact that the National Labor Relations
Board has taken a consistent view, not always agreed to
by the AF of L-CIO, that any union coercion constitutes
the basis for an appropriate 8(b)(1)(A) charge.

There

is ample precedent for the National Labor Relations
Board having so held, and even as late as 1985.
This Court in DelCostello noted that this
Court itself has never passed upon the validity of that
Board policy, that is, that all breaches of the duty of

22

25

fair representation are unfair labor practices.
Nonetheless, that wasn't important to this Court because
the family resemblance was there.

We submit that since

Many of the defects that are discussed here
today by the Petitioner are satisfied in the accrual
analysis.

For instance, an action has been consistently

held by the circuits to accrue only when a member knows
or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should know
of the acts constituting a claim of breach of the duty.
With respect to investigation, that won't occur until
adequate investigation and knowledge is present.
In this case the counsel sitting at this table

for Petitioner wrote a letter to the president of the
union -- this is in the record -- stating that since the
organization had not adjusted matters satisfactorily to
his -- to his client, that he had advised his client to
sue within six weeks, stating that -- that suit -- that
he had recommended to his client to sue by September 15,
1983.

Yet, this -- this counsel and Mr. Reed waited

nearly two years after the sending of that letter.
This case doesn't present a very good one for
retention of counsel as a factor to be considered

because counsel was already retained.

The action did

not accrue until the counsel wrote a second letter to
the organization noting his dissatisfaction with the
resolution of the matter with the organization itself.
Moreover, the factors with regard to
practicalities of litigation that are mentioned by the
Petitioner were also considered by this Court in
DelCostello, the very same factors.

It was for that

reason -- that -- that is the presence of the very
factors that we're talking about today -- that this
Court chose to apply the six months from Section 10(b)
of the LMRA rather than the shorter arbitration statutes
from the states.

With regard to those litigation

factors, this Court determined that was just
insufficient time.
We would submit that therefore the presence of
the factors that are mentioned by the Petitioner have
already been considered by this Court and have already
been determined to be fully served by applying Section
10(b) of the Act.
This Court also observed in DelCostello that
it was not only the private settlements under the labor

22

laws that were at issue, but also the formation of the
23
24
25

agreement which is too little recognized by the
Petitioner and amici on that side.

noted in the Steelworkers case, which is the principal
case for the pro-Costello -- DelCostello view here, if
internal problems are permitted to fester too long,
union officials become overly concerned with regard to
their political struggles and that detracts from their
ability to deal with management.
In other words, whether a breach of either

Landrum Griffin or the duty of fair representation
occurs internally or externally, the effect is the
same.

Both have been held by the National Labor

Relations Board to constitute unfair labor practice
charges.

There is no reason to treat them differently.
Indeed, the rights that are protected by

Landrum Griffin are the very same rights that are at the
core of the federal labor laws, the Section 7 rights
that were granted by the Wagner Act.

In -- in Taft

Hartley, the Congress acted to ensure that those rights,
the rights to engage in concerted activity, were not
taken away by unduly harassing tactics by unions, added
a whole class of unfair labor practice charges in
Section 8 (b) .
In 1959 with Landrum Griffin, the Congress

again was concerned that the rights that were so granted
and so insulated from harassment by Taft Hartley would
not be driven by undemocratic processes, but we're still
talking about the rights to collective -- to
collectively bargain.
constitutional rights.
As this Court soundly noted in Steelworkers v.

7

8
9
10
11
12
13

Sadlowski, the bill of rights in Landrum Griffin are not
coextensive with First Amendment rights because the
offering of the bill of rights by Senator McClellan on
the floor was modified by virtually unanimous adoption
of a floor amendment which permitted the union
reasonable regulation of those rights.
This Court does not permit reasonable

14
15
16

regulation of First Amendment rights.

19

20

And in that

regard -QUESTION:

17
18

We're not talking about

How -- how does that bear on the

statute of limitations issue?

Are you suggesting that

constitutional rights, because they're at the top of one
hierarchy, must have the longest statute of limitations?
MR. MILLER:

21

Not at all, Mr. Chief Justice.

I'm merely suggesting that constitutional rights will be
22

handled differently because there's an appropriate state
23
24
25

statute.

In other words, this Court has determined with

regard to, for instance, the civil rights acts, 1983 and
26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

1981, that those are more in the nature of personal

2

injury, and the Constitution is at the core of the

3

enforcement of those rights.
My point here is that one can't leap to the

conclusion that just because the statute says bill of
rights, that that automatically makes it civil rights.
These are labor law rights, federal statutory labor law
rights.

And this Court has consistently made that

clear. By quoting Professor Cox that Landrum Griffin
being a product of political compromise, one can't
absolutely apply every word, but must realize the
context in which it arose.

This Court has consistently

done that and has recognized that those rights are not
coextensive with the First Amendment.
Again, it just bolsters the argument that the
organization has here that this class of rights are
labor law rights.

They all relate back to the right to

bargain collectively.

They all were an attempt to

assure democratic processes within the union so that
bargaining collectively meant something.

The union

can't, by its reasonable regulation, take away or
detract from those rights.
If it does, it perforce commits an unfair
labor practice and it should dealt with appropriately
but within a relatively short span of time because the

rapid resolution of labor disputes of any character,
internal or external, are at the core of the national
labor policy whether they deal with private settlements
or whether they deal with the formation of agreements
initially.
Some lower courts prior to this Court's
decision in Plumbers', as observed by the AFL-CIO in
this case, felt that one had to analyze the propriety of
a Section 301 action to enforce a union constitution.
This Court had little difficulty in holding that Section
301 was available as a remedy for a violation of a union
constitution.
For the same reason that this Court found
Section 301 available to remedy a violation of a union
constitution, we suggest that Section 10(b) amply
supports an appropriate limitations period for
enforcement of the rights here.

It should be a

It should be the same time period for

all violations, and it should be Section 10(b) because
that governs unfair labor practice charges, and the
National Labor Relations Board has consistently held
violation of Landrum Griffin Title I bill of rights

practice charges.
Whether these rights can be characterized as

Thank you very much.
QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Miller.

Mr. Gresham, you have 10 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN W. GRESHAM
MR. GRESHAM:

I think the most important point

that I would make on rebuttal is the great disagreement
I have with Mr. Miller's contention with the question
from Justice White that this would constitute an unfair
labor practice that Mr. Reed could have, in fact, gone
to the Board.

I think this Court's law and cases -- I

think the very recent decision of the Third Circuit in
NLRB v. Local 139 which said that the 8(b)(1)(A) should
not be interpreted so literally as to make it a unfair
labor practice to enforce compliance with internal rules
and policy is precisely what is at fact here.
The government in its brief makes exactly the
same point.

There is very, very little overlap between

the Title I claim and the unfair labor practice claim.
The year after Title I was passed in its 25th
annual report, the Board itself said we don't reach
these disputes, these internal union matters, even if
there is a bad motive.

For -- for the union to now

argue essentially, as I understand it, that Title I
really wasn't needed, that -- that Senator McClellan's
bill was simply to in somehow reinforce rights that were

already granted, I think would make a mockery of the
legislative history of Title I.
QUESTION:

Wouldn't you think there are some

things that broadly are matters of internal union
business that are unfair labor practices?
MR. GRESHAM:

There are and I have been able

to identify two areas where the Board has taken those.
One is where they beat the fellow up.

The second is

where they try to discipline because he has gone to the
Board or he has gone to the Department of Labor before.
They protect their jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

Well, and are -- and are those --

are those suable on without going to the Board?
MR. GRESHAM:

They would be suable on as a

Title I claim, yes.
QUESTION:

Yes, exactly.

And even in those circumstances you think the
six months should not apply?
MR. GRESHAM:

That is correct because there is

such a minute overlap between the two.

We don't have to

reach that in this case because I think it -- it is
clear that this type of discipline simply would not
constitute an unfair labor practice under any of this
Court's decision, under the recent Third Circuit
decision, under the Board's own language.

The proviso -- I did not hear Respondent
mention that all the proviso that is -- that is included
in 8(b)(1)(A) which is that it does not reach these
mechanisms.

And I think that -- that keeps this from

being an analogy.
And I think the important point there is that
when this Court looked in DelCostello to see whether
10(b) should apply, I think the terms this Court used
was "substantial overlap."

I would -- I would submit to

this Court that at most in this case there is a very
minimal overlap.
I think as -- as -- as the Solicitor General
indicated in his brief, these actions vindicate
important public rights.
There is no basis for this Court to depart
from its usual practice.

None of the problems noted in

DelCostello are present here.

There is no interference,

direct interference -- and I believe again that is the
language of this Court in DelCostello -- with the
collective bargaining agreement.

Therefore, the usual

practice is the practice that is available here.
