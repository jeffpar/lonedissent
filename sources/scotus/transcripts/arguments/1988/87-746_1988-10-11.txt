ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A.W. BORAKS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. BORAKS:

8
9

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice,

may it please the Court:

10

Before the Court is the case of a natural

11

father whose claim of paternity was precluded by the

12

operation of a California state statute, which had the

13

effect of terminating an existing parent-child

14

relationship.

15

Also before the Court is the natural father's

16

daughter, who is represented by a court-appointed

17

independent guardian ad litem.

18

challenging the Constitutionality of that California

19

statute.

Both are here

With the Court's permission I would like to

20
21

begin with a synopsis of the pertinent facts in this

22

case.
In the fall of 1980, Michael was having an

23
24

intimate relationship with Carole, who was married to

25

Gerald.

Carole became pregnant with Michael's child.

1

Victoria, the child, was born in May of 1981.

2

Carole and Victoria subsequently had an HLA test done

3

which showed a 98.06, I believe, percent probability of

4

paternity.

5

Michael,

In November of 1982, Michael filed suit in the

6

California courts to have himself declared Victoria's

7

father.

8

11

QUESTION:

This was while the mother was

married to Gerald, right?
MR. BORAKS:

I'm describing, Your Honor, occurred while --

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. BORAKS:

14
15

I believe that all of the events

They have never been divorced?
Not to my knowledge.

Certainly

not as of the end of the record in this case.
In his suit Michael asked to be declared

16

Victoria's father, he asked that the court set a

17

reasonable support level for him to provide, and he

18

asked for the court to allow him visitation.

19

After the suit was filed, there came a time

20

when Carole and Victoria lived with Michael, and they

21

lived with Michael throughout most of the third year of

22

Victoria's life.

23

During that period Michael was held out by

24

Carole and by himself to the world and to Victoria as

25

Victoria's father.

He cared for the child, he supported

5

1

the child and the mother, and in all respects he assumed

2

the role of father.

3

And as a consequence, Victoria came to know

4

him as her daddy and a parent-child relationship

5

developed between the two of them.

6

This lasted until around May of 1984 when

7

Carole broke up with Michael.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. BORAKS:

10

There were two separate periods,

the one I've just described --

11
12

How long was that period in all?

QUESTION:

When the child was living with

Michael.

13

MR. BORAKS:

As I say, there were two separate

14

periods.

15

of 1983 till around late April, early May of 1984.

16

Eight, nine, maybe 10 months.

17

QUESTION:

18

The one I just described was from about August

Nine months.

August to April, eight months.

Give you nine.

19

MR. BORAKS:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. BORAKS:

I accept your arithmetic.
What, what was the other period?
The other period was a period in,

22

for about three months in early 1982, January, February,

23

and March.

24

whether it was a full three months or only part of that

25

quarter, but --

I'm not sure exactly how many days or

QUESTION:

period that the child was living with Gerald?
MR. BORAKS:

3
4

As of May of 1984?

Or as, as of

what point in time -- as of May of 1984 -QUESTION:

5

6

And that contrasts to how much of a

As of the time of the decision

below.

7

MR. BORAKS:

Oh, as of the time -- in January

8

of 1985, as of the time of the summary judgment being

9

granted to Gerald, I would say that Gerald probably had

10

the edge in terms of time.

11

much.
QUESTION:

12
13

a good deal, no.

Well, you know he had the edge, by

I mean, the facts are the facts.

MR. BORAKS:

14

But I'm not sure by how

Well, yes, they are, and I'm not

15

trying to play with them.

16

good deal, Your Honor.

I don't think it was by a

I think maybe by three, four months.

17

But I

18

don't have, I don't have it clearly fixed in my mind

19

what the discrepancy might have been as of that point in

20

time.

21

In any event, after Carole and Michael broke

22

up, the court below awarded Michael pendente lite

23

visitation for a period of time, and then also ordered

24

an evaluation of the situation by an independent

25

court-appointed psychologist.
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

7

And that evaluation did take place prior to

1

2

the granting of the summary judgment motion.

3

psychologist interviewed and examined Michael, Carole,

4

Gerald and Victoria, wrote an extensive report.

5

The

And his bottom-line recommendation was that

6

Michael be recognized as a parent of Victoria and

7

allowed visitation.

8

solely on his assessment, that is they psychologist's

9

assessment of what was in Victoria's best interest.

And this recommendation was based

After that report came out, Gerald filed a

10

11

motion for summary judgment, which was granted in

12

January of 1985.

13

judgment, the trial court applied the conclusive

14

presumption of California Evidence Code Section 621.

15

And based on that provision he adjudicated

In granting the motion for summary

16

Gerald to be the father and terminated the relationship

17

between Michael and Victoria.
What Section 621 says is that, given certain

18
19

predicate facts, a child conceived by a married woman is

20

conclusively presumed to the child of that woman's

21

husband.

22

Michael and Victoria appealed, and the summary

23

judgment decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.

24

In affirming the lower court's granting of summary

25

judgment, I believe that what the Court of Appeal did
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

8

1

was close a question left open by the California Supreme

2

Court in a previous case called Michelle W.

3

In that case the California Supreme Court left

4

open the question of whether Section 621 could be

5

Constitutionally applied to terminate an ongoing

6

parent-child relationship.

7

The Court of Appeal, without saying so

8

explicitly but in logic, necessarily answered that

9

question, yes.

And in our view erroneously so.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. BORAKS:

Mr. Boraks, where is Victoria now?
Well, I'm not entirely sure, Your

12

Honor.

13

to believe that she's in New York living with Carole and

14

Gerald.

I believe that she's in New York.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. BORAKS:

17

QUESTION:

I have reason

Mr. Boraks -Justice O'Connor.
I guess this Court has articulated

18

the view that the biological relationship of the father

19

with the child alone is not sufficient to give him any

20

Constitutionally protected liberty interest in that

21

relationship.

There has to be something more.

And in the Stanley against Illinois case, I

22
23

believe, the father had lived with the child for 18

24

years.

25

in the nature of four years.

And in the Caban case, I think, it was something

8

9

Do you think that this off and on period of

1

2

seven or eight months in your situation representing the

3

father here effectively presents a substantial

4

relationship of that nature?

5

MR. BORAKS:

Yes, Your Honor.

I don't think

6

the analysis is quantitative, or is meant to be in those

7

cases.

I believe it's qualitative.

8

I believe that it depends on the quality of

9

the relationship and the nature of the conduct of the

10
11

natural father.

I believe --

QUESTION:

12

that would be enough?

13

MR. BORAKS:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. BORAKS:

16

If, if -A week.
If that were enough, in fact,

which I doubt it could be --

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. BORAKS:

19

So it could be a month or so and

So it is quantitative in a sense.
No, it's qualitative, but there's

a relationship between quantity and quality.

20

There's a relationship between the -- there's

21

a connection, a logical connection involving the amount

22

of time it takes to develop a qualitative relationship

23

that gives rise to the Constitutional rights.

24

I'm not qualified -- no pun intended -- but

25

I'm not qualified to say what that period of time is.
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

10

1

But I think that clearly that relationship did develop

2

on this record in this case.

3

QUESTION:

What you're asking for on behalf of

4

the father is a recognition of a right to a hearing, to

5

establish the parental relationship.

6

MR. BORAKS:

7

QUESTION:

Is that correct?

Yes, Your Honor.
Would there any, be anything at

8

issue in that hearing other than that parental

9

relationship?

Doesn't involve custody.

10

MR. BORAKS:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. BORAKS:

13

come up in this case.

14

visitation.

15

Well, that has never -Or visitation.
That has never -- custody has not
Certainly it would involve

I think it involves the status, the legal

16

status of parentage, and to borrow a phrase, a bundle of

17

rights attendant to that legal status.

18

QUESTION:

Let me ask you this.

If this Court

19

were to determine that the father was entitled to some

20

hearing to establish the parental relationship, would

21

the child through her guardian be entitled, under

22

California law, to appear at that hearing and to be

23

represented and to be heard?

24
25

MR. BORAKS:

I can't cite chapter and verse of

why I believe this is so, but I do believe that the
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

11

1

child would be entitled to --

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. BORAKS:

As a matter of California law.
I believe as a matter of

4

California law, and I believe as a matter of

5

Constitutional law.

6

QUESTION:

Then why would we have to address

7

here any question concerning the child's

8

Constitutionally protected liberty interest?

9

anything that we have to determine then here?

10

MR. BORAKS:

I think that they're reciprocal

11

in nature.

12

relationship involves a symmetry.

13

It's a symmetrical concept.

QUESTION:

The

Well, that's a pretty big

14

unanswered question.

15

apart from the parent.

16

Is that

What the right of the child is,

What I'm trying to explore is why there's any

17

need to determine that, if in any event she would be

18

entitled to be heard in any hearing in California.

19

MR. BORAKS:

I understand.

If the Court were

20

to determine that Michael is entitled to a hearing, I

21

believe the Court could stop there, and not have to go

22

on to reach the question of whether Victoria is entitled

23

to a hearing as a matter of Constitutional analysis.

24
25

QUESTION:

Are you going to argue here this

morning that she is entitled in her own right to have
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

12

1

that hearing?
MR. BOPAKS:

2

Well, I was certainly planning to

3

argue that the failure to hold a hearing, the failure to

4

inquire into, on the merits into the issue of where her

5

best interests lay is a Constitutional deprivation with

6

respect to her.
And I had not planned to abandon that

7

8

argument, but I do agree that what you, what you say,

9

Justice O'Connor, is correct.

10

QUESTION:

Well, suppose there's been an

11

adoption proceeding, and some child has been adopted.

12

Now, does that child have a right then to go in later

13

and establish a parental relationship with a biological

14

parent?

15

MR. BORAKS:

Well, with whom the child has had

16

a relationship?

That's a much tougher question.

17

not sure of the answer to that.

18

sure of the answer.

19

QUESTION:

I'm

But in this case I am

And I suppose the child in this

20

case could, if the parent, if parentage was proven,

21

could ask for support.

22

MR. BORAKS:

The, the notion of a support

23

obligation was inherent in Michael H.'s complaint.

24

understood that, he acknowledged that --

25

QUESTION:

He

I know but, I know he understood
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

13

1

it, but whether he understood it or not --

2
3

MR. BORAKS:

Even if he didn't

understand it --

4
5

Right.

QUESTION:

I suppose the child could press for

support if the child proved the parentage.

6

MR. BORAKS:

Right.

Michael could be made to

7

understand his support obligation, whether he understood

8

it or not.

9

QUESTION:

So any time a wife has a child by

10

somebody other than the husband it kind of becomes a

11

menage a trois?

12

structural relationship of the marriage.

13
14

MR. BORAKS:

Well, not any time, Your Honor,

because

15
16

The lover is introduced into the

Well, with one, one week, you said,

21

necessary to --

it would be a

factual determination in every case.

I mean,

if you

if it's strictly a question of, you know,

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

14

1

rule.

It's got to have a hearing every time this

2

happens, and the lover-father wants to get in the act.

3

MR. BORAKS:

What the rule has to be, Your

4

Honor, we contend, is that any time a relationship has

5

been established between natural father and natural

6

child which qualifies for a liberty interest under this

7

Court's test, that any time that occurs there must be a

8

hearing.

9

QUESTION:

Well, but that's tautological.

10

Well, what, what relationship does qualify for a liberty

11

interest?
MR. BORAKS:

12

It's a relationship that has two

13

elements.

Number one, biological paternity under this

14

Court's decisions, and number two, action by the natural

15

father to come forward and grasp the opportunity to

16

serve as father in fact and develop, to develop a

17

father-child relationship with his natural child.
QUESTION:

18

Well, what if, what if the natural

19

father comes over to the house and says, I want to see

20

my natural father, the husband says, get out of here.

21

Now, is the natural father entitled to pursue

22

that relationship even though the husband does not want

23

him to?

24
25

MR. BORAKS:

Well, that's harder question, and

not one that I have to answer for this case.

But I

14

ALDERSOIM REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

15

would answer it, no.

That that's not required.

That

2

the second element of what is necessary to establish a

3

liberty interest is absent.

4

The man may, the natural father may be

5

pursuing that element, may be trying to get that

6

element.

7

have a liberty interest under this Court's decisions.

8
9

But if he hasn't gotten it, then he does not

And the problem with Section 621 is it makes
no distinction between two distinct subclasses, natural

10

parents who have developed a relationship, and natural

11

parents who have not.

12

QUESTION:

They're treated the same.
But as far as the child is

13

concerned it seems to me it wouldn't make any difference

14

whether there's been a father-child relationship

15

established.

16

can, if you can prove parenthood, can get support.

17

is entitled to a hearing for that.

As far as the child is concerned the child

18

MR. BORAKS:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. BORAKS:

Well -Isn't that right?
I -- no, I don't think the child

21

has a Constitutional right in the absence of a

22

relationship to support.

23

And

I think that's a matter that could be

24

committed to state law, and that California could say

25

that a child is not entitled to support from a natural
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

16

1

father in a circumstance covered by Section 621 where

2

there has been no established relationship.

3

California's free to do that statutorally.

4

QUESTION:

I think

I'm somewhat surprised you conceded

5

in your answer to the Chief Justice that the father does

6

not have the right to establish the relation, because

7

under your theory of the case it's the father's natural

8

expectations, his great desire to be a father that is

9

really the propelling force of your case.

It's not just

10

protecting the relation that's happened for seven

11

months.
So it seems to me that the logical thrust of

12
13

your case would require you to answer the Chief

14

Justice's question differently, that the father, if you

15

prevail, does have this right to establish a relation.
MR. BORAKS:

16

Well, the reason I answered the

17

Chief Justice the way I do is because I feel compelled

18

to answer within the parameters of this Court's

19

decision.

20

QUESTION:

Well, we're trying to, we're trying

21

to explore the dimensions and the articulation of the

22

theory that we would have to adopt in order to rule for

23

you in this case.

24
25

MR. BORAKS:

Well, I don't want to discourage

the Court from adopting a principle that mere biological
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

17

1

paternity, that being a natural father in and of itself

2

gives rise to certain rights.

3

QUESTION:

4
5

But it seemed to me by your answer

to the Chief Justice you foreclose that.
MR. BORAKS:

Well, I've only not argued it.

6

don't know that the Court is not free to re-examine the

7

limitations of Lehr v. Robertson and to say that, upon

8

further consideration, the question wasn't really

9

foreclosed in that case but it was pretty soundly dealt

10

with, that upon further consideration there aren't

11

necessarily two elements to the liberty interest, that

12

is biology and the assumption of parental

13

responsibilities, but mere biology has attendant to it

14

certain rights.

15

That was, that idea was not foreclosed by Lehr

16

v. Robertson, but the language was pretty discouraging

17

in terms of my standing and making an argument in the

18

face of that, that mere biology would suffice.

19

So perhaps I chickened out, but -- it feels, I

20

feel that the prudent way for me to proceed is based on

21

this Court's decisions.

22

I

QUESTION:

Well, absent, absent this

23

Mr. Boraks, do any of those prior

is the one in which the state says that the biological

parent who's been raising the child for many years is

15

simply automatically, simply by reason of having sired

the child out of wedlock, not a fit parent.

You're being told that the statute is applied

14

blindly and mechanically to establish the fact, by

15

presumption, that a husband invariably in every case is

16

the man who is responsible for the conception of his

17

wife's child.

18

That is a misrepresentation of Section 621's

19

purpose or of its effect.

What Section 621 is is a rule

20

for identifying the father of a child which does not

21

look to the facts of conception as the basis for

22

identifying the man on whom the state will confer the

23

rights and impose the obligations of paternity.

24

We simply don't think in these cases that the

25

fact of biological responsibility is as significant as,

2

But I ought to mention the case simply to

point out that, in this case, it was the putative father

who relied on Section 621.

5

The man who was biologically responsible, who

6

in that case had established a relationship with the

7

child, after the mother and the husband had divorced,

8

with the husband and mother agreeing that the husband

9

was not the father of the child, the putative father

10

assumed that responsibility informally when he then

11

separated from the mother after a period of about 17

12

months of living with the child, the putative father

13

then stopped paying for support for the child, the

14

mother brought an action against him.
And the putative father relied upon Section

15
16

621 arguing that you can't impose the responsibility on

17

me, Section 621, just read the words of the statute, it

18

says that it's the husband that's responsible and not

And by the way, I would point out that one of

19

20

the major issues in this case is that, once we determine

21

which of these two men is the father of the child, that

22

man becomes the father for all purposes, so that if

23

tomorrow Carole were to die, under California law, the

24

father would have the sole and exclusive right to

25

custody.

ALDERSOIM REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

And if Carole were to die tomorrow, or the day

2

after tomorrow, but tomorrow the court were to say that

3

Michael -- excuse me -- is entitled to recognition as

4

Victoria's father, Victoria would be removed from the

5

only home that she's known since her birth, and required

6

then by the law, at Michael's request at least, to

7

reside with him.

8
9

So we think that the scope of this question is
enormous.

And I think all of these matters have to be

10

taken into account, as they have been by the California

11

legislature in adopting the law, and the California

12

courts in applying and interpreting it.

QUESTION:

Well, I take it what the biological

14

father is asking is just for the right of visitation.

In fact, at the hearing on the summary

6

judgment motion, Michael was, at Michael's counsel, told

7

the judge, who indicated his intention to rule in favor

8

of Gerald, that, well Your Honor, if you're going to

9

deny me my claim for visitation, for paternity, why

10

don't you then award me visitation under Section 4601?

11

And the court responded, because you haven't

12

asked for visitation under Section 4601, this is a

13

paternity action.

14

that relief, file an action and ask for it.

QUESTION:

If you think you have the right to

What is your position on whether,

does the presumption effect the right to that relief?
MR. HOFFMAN:

The presumption, I think, has

nothing to do with the right to that relief.
I'm assuming that if Section 4601 allows the

20

court to award visitation to non-parents, then the

21

presumption -- of course the effect that it has is that

22

it puts Michael on a much different standard in

23

requesting visitation than he would be if he were

24

recognized as Victoria's father.

25

Because in that, under 4601, insofar as it

relates to non-parents, the court has the discretion to

2

grant or not grant visitation in the court's

3

discretion.

4

QUESTION:

So if you were the judge and

5

Michael brings that action, and he puts on evidence, he

6

says I want to show that I'm the father, I want to

7

testify that I'm the biological father, I -- don't you

8

exclude that evidence based on the presumption?

9
10

MR. HOFFMAN:

Correct.

It's irrelevant that

he claims to be the biological father.

11

QUESTION:

Well, so then he really can't, then

12

he, then he's standing there and he has nothing to say

13

at all.

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, if he's never established

15

a relationship and the court determines that this is a

16

person who does not have an interest in Victoria's

17

welfare, then that's correct.

18

the opportunity to establish court-ordered visitation

19

with Victoria.

20

QUESTION:

Then he would not have

Well, so then the presumption does

21

apply, does have some application in a purely visitation

22

proceeding.

23

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes, it does.

As has been

24

indicated earlier, I think that there's been a

25

misstatement made in the briefs and in the argument here

concerning the way in which Section 621 works.

2

We've been told that 621 acts to terminate an

3

ongoing, an existing relationship, and in fact that's

4

not the case at all.

5

terminated the relationship that existed between

6

Victoria and Michael.

It is the mother who in this case

The only purpose served by the statute in this

7

8

case was to preserve a relationship.

9

relationship that it preserved was a relationship of my

And the

client with Victoria.

11

The appellants mentioned, and I heard the

12

argument during Mr. Boraks' time up here, that there was

13

a significant relationship that existed between Michael

14

and Victoria, and that has Constitutional significance.
But the fact of the matter is that Section 621

15
16

says that Michael has no opportunity to develop a

17

relationship with Victoria.

18

Carole's acquiescence that Michael even had a chance to

19

see Victoria at any time during her minority.

It was solely by reason of

The state of California would not have

20
21

permitted him, had she been more resistant to his

22

efforts.

23

Because of that, I think that, while I

24

understand Mr. Boraks wants to bring this case under the

25

cases of this Court that have referred to the

2

and child, he can't.
QUESTION:

3

If Carole had never gone back to

4

Gerald, and was living with, just living with Michael,

5

could they have together gone to court and had Michael

declared -MR. HOFFMAN:

7

They could well indeed, Your

8

Honor, under the statute within the child's first two

9

years
QUESTION:

10
11

This presumption would not have

applied?
MR. HOFFMAN:

12

The mother joined by an

13

acknowledgment of paternity by the putative father, so

14

again the child is not being left fatherless, may file a

15

motion which, in practice what it does is it requires

16

the husband then, notwithstanding the provisions of

17

Section 621, to submit to a blood test in order to

18

establish the facts of conception.
QUESTION:

19

Well now, is that -- why does, why

does this presumption statute permit that?

21

terms, or by another provision?

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

23

QUESTION:

By its

Yes, expressly by its terms.

So in effect its application

24

depends to a certain extent on the position the mother

takes.

That's right.

4

responsibility by the putative father, also within the

5

first two years.

And he, without the acknowledgment of

I think the theory underlying those two

6
7

exceptions is -- well, of course, in this case we have

8

mother and husband united in a family wanting to raise

9

this child together.

10
11

QUESTION:

And that's where the presumption

applies.

12

MR. HOFFMAN:

That's where it applies, and it

13

excludes Michael, it excludes the guardian ad litem for

the child.

So, so suppose the husband takes

16

this action and he wants to prove that Michael is the

19

So he proves it, then what happens?

MR. HOFFMAN:

available to him at that point.

QUESTION:

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes, all right.
I think to the extent that the

3

appellants look for a significant relationship between

themselves in order to come under the protection, the

5

rules that are formulated in Stanley and Caban and Lehr

and Quilloin, they do themselves a disservice, because

a relationship with Victoria by coming to court.

And I think that there simply is no relevance

to the development of any relationship between the

putative father and the child in cases coming under

QUESTION:

15

Well, of course, under your view of

16

the statute, if Michael had lived with the child for

17

three years, and then the husband and the wife had

re-united, the presumption would go into effect, would

19

it not?

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

The presumption would remain in

21

effect, if no one had actually taken steps to rebut it

22

during that period of time.

23

But of course Carole and Michael could have,

24

within those three year period, taken the action that

25

they needed to preserve the relationship -41

2

QUESTION:

But if they didn't, the presumption

goes into effect.

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

That's correct.

There has also

4

been discussion of whether the result in this case was

5

in Victoria's best interests.

6

We don't think that that's relevant, that in

7

this particular case it makes no difference whether it

8

would or would not have been in Victoria's best

9

interests that Michael be recognized as her father.

10

This is a paternity action.

And in paternity

11

cases we don't determine the question of paternity in --

12

in those cases where we use the rule of biological

13

connection, we don't consider the question of the

14

child's best interest in that particular case in

15

deciding whether a man is or is not the father, we look

16

to the facts.

17

We look to the fact of whether there was

18

intercourse between the child and the mother which

19

resulted in the child's conception and ultimately her

20

birth.

21

QUESTION:

I suppose the Court could find that

22

a particular person is the child's father and yet deny

23

that person custody, and indeed forbid that person from

24

even seeing the child.

25

MR. HOFFMAN:

Is that possible?
That's, that certainly is a

In other words, simply a hearing to establish

2
3

the fact of a biological connection with, which has no

4

operative significance?

5

QUESTION:

I think that certainly could --

It would have, it would have

6

operative significance insofar as liability for support

7

is concerned.

8

MR. HOFFMAN:

9

QUESTION:

So he --

If you have a father who's violent,

10

something of that sort, I suppose a court could keep the

11

child away from that father, even though the parentage

12

would be acknowledged as his.
MR. HOFFMAN:

13

That's correct.

But the fact

14

that the, it would or would not be in the child's best

15

interests to visit with that particular man is not

16

relevant to the question of whether he's entitled to

17

recognition as her father.
QUESTION:

18

So it isn't really getting to see

19

at all.

44

MR. HOFFMAN:

1

That's correct.

I mean, if it

2

would be harmful to the child that the man would have

3

contact with her, then he could be recognized as her

4

father and yet kept away from her.

5

If there are no further questions --

6

QUESTION:

Yes, I have a question.

Would you

7

comment on the, there's an allegation in the complaint

8

that the natural father has some kind of a genetic

9

disease that the, his descendants might also have,

10

including the child here, I suppose, and it would be in

11

the best interests of the child's medical future and all

12

to have that fact established so they can know how to

13

treat her if the problem arose.

14

to this problem?
MR. HOFFMAN:

15

Has that any relevance

We think not.

I mean, if in

16

fact Michael were Victoria's biological father, then

17

that information has been made known to Carole, and is

18

available to her.
And unless we can believe that Carole and

19

20

Gerald are not going to do what they believe to be in

21

the best interests of the child which might involve

22

genetic counseling for the child, I think that ought not

23

to have any, any part in the decision of whether Michael

24

is or is not entitled to recognition as Victoria's

25

father.
44

45

But those are questions of custody and support

1

2

and visitation, that's what follows from the

3

determination of paternity.

4

fact such as that that ought to be made known to

5

Victoria, we hope that it will be, and we have no reason

6

to believe that it won't be.

If there's an interesting

But certainly not to go so far as to say the

7

8

question of paternity, where the law identifies a

9

particular man as the one who bears that legal

10

relationship with the child, ought to be governed by

11

facts such as those.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

16

MR. BORAKS:

Thank you, Your Honor.

I would

17

like to say something about what happens under

18

California state law absent the so-called conclusive

19

presumption, if, if in fact, let's say, Gerald and

20

Carole had not been cohabitating for the month during

21

which Victoria was conceived.

22

Both Michael as a person who took the child

23

into his home and held the child out as his own, and

24

Gerald as a person married to the child's mother, would

25

be presumed father under the California statutory

scheme, but they would be rebuttable presumptions.
And in that instance a hearing would be held,

3

the purpose of which would be to make a determination

based on -- which on the facts is founded under

5

weightier considerations of policy and logic.

6

what would happen in this case absent the conclusive

7

presumption.

That's

8

Now, I'd like to say something about --

9

QUESTION:

10
11
12

Does the presumption apply when the

husband and wife are cohabiting on the date of birth?
MR. BORAKS:

I think the presumption is geared

to conception, Your Honor.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. BORAKS:

Because if you look --

Do California cases say that?
Well, if you look at the

15

statutory scheme, there's a whole set of these

16

rebuttable presumptions that have to do with the status

17

of marriage as of the time of the child's birth.

18

the issue of -- and the idea of cohabitation really

19

seems to relate to conception rather than birth.

20

And

I would like to say something about

21

visitation.

Number one, Victoria did ask for

22

visitation.

And number two, visitation may not

23

necessarily go along with Michael's ability to establish

24

his paternity here.

25

along with his inability to establish his paternity.

But no visitation certainly went

11

You say Victoria asked for

Yes, Your Honor.
How old was the child when she made

this -MR. BORAKS:

Well, the guardian ad litem asked

for visitation.
QUESTION:

And how does the guardian ad litem

get the authority -- I mean, just, well I'm a little
puzzled by that.
MR. BORAKS:

Well, I think the guardian ad

12

litem has an obligation to act in what she perceived to

13

be the child's best interest under the circumstances.

14

think the authority is based on the order of the court

15

establishing the relationship.

16

And lastly, Your Honors, it is not I alone who

17

stand here to tell you that the relationship was

18

significant or how significant or whatever.

19

I

I'm relying on what the California Court of

20

Appeal found and what it based its decision on, which is

21

that we appreciate that Michael H. has shown an interest

22

in Victoria D., almost since her birth, has established

23

an affectionate relationship with her, and has at times

24

even contributed to her support.

25

So the California Court of Appeal based its

decision on the assumption that there was a

2

relationship, but found it, the implications of that to

3

be outweighed by the state interest.
And our position is, the state interests are

5

legitimate and weighty, but they're insufficient to

justify the denial of any right to be heard on the

merits of the contention made by Michael or Victoria.
