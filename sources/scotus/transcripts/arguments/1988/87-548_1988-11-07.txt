ORAL ARGUMENT OF MURRAY GARTNER, ESQ.

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

11
12

MR. GARTNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case arises from an economic strike

13

against TWA by the union representing its flight

14

attendants, known as IFFA.

15

When the strike was called off by the union in

16

May of 1986, after more than two months, TWA was

17

operating a full schedule with a workforce consisting of

18

2,800 new hires and some 1,200 incumbents, or crossovers

19

-- that is, pre-strike flight attendants who chose to

20

remain at work or to resume working during the strike.

21

At that time, there were only 200 vacancies.

22
23
24
25

TWA filled them by re-hiring unreinstated strikers in
seniority order.
Since that time, more than 2,500 strikers have
been rehired to fill additional vacancies.

Upon rehire,

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

they have been credited with their full pre-strike

2

seniority.
The Eighth Circuit, however, held that TWA had

3
4

violated the Railway Labor Act when the strike ended

5

because it did not remove incumbents from their jobs and

6

replace them with strikers who had more pre-strike

7

seniority.

8

right of new hires under the Railway Labor Act to keep

9

their jobs against the claims of unreinstated strikers,

Since the court below, however, affirmed the

10

the question raised by its decision is why the Railway

11

Labor Act, unlike the NLRA, requires a carrier at the

12

end of a strike to treat some 1,200 incumbent employees

13

less favorably than new hires.
QUESTION:

14
15

Maybe they were wrong about new

hires.
MR. GARTNER:

16

I don't think they were, Justice

17

Scalia.

18

they're right, and the Solicitor General has filed a

19

brief on behalf of the National Labor Relations Board

20

which says that they were right.

21

22
23
24
25

There's 50 years of precedent which says

The District Court thought they were right and
I think -- I think they're right.
(Laughter)
MR. GARTNER:

To the extent that that

decision, however, was based on the Eighth Circuit's
4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

view of the NLRA decisions, I will leave the argument

2

that the Court misapprehended long-established NLRA law

3

to the Solicitor General, who is here on behalf of the

4

National Labor Relations Board.
I will address the arguments about the RLA,

5

6

which the Respondent now makes without any support from

7

the decision below.

8

section 2 Fourth -- and this Court's decision in Florida

9

East Coast Railway, require that the risk of job loss

10

inherent in any strike much be shifted from those who

11

choose to remain on strike to those employees who choose

12

to work.

13

Respondent says that the RLA

Neither the statutory section, we believe, nor

14

the Court's decision, separately or together, lead to

15

that result.

16

Section 2 Fourth clearly is focused, as its

17

first sentence reveals, on the employees' "right to

18

organize and bargain collectively through

19

representatives of their own choosing."

20

mention strikes, strikers, or concerted activities.

21

22
23

It does not

By contrast, the NLRA has Section 23, which
defines strikers as employees until they secure
substantially equivalent employment. RLA section 1

24

Fifth, however, contains no such definition.

Section 7

25

and 8(a)(1) of the NLRA taken together like RLA section
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

2 Fourth prohibit interference or coercion in the

2

employees' right to form or join unions or not to do so.

3

But in addition, those sections specifically

4

and broadly protect concerted activities, and have no

5

counterpart in the RLA.

6

NLRA Section 13 also without any counterpart

7

in the RLA specifically protects the right to strike.

8

RLA section 2 Fourth, therefore, cannot reasonably be

9

thought to give more protection to strikes and strikers

10

than the specific provisions of the NLRA dealing with

11

those subjects.

12

If anything, it must give less.

Most of the decisions of the lower courts

13

construing it, in fact, as the amicus brief of the Air

14

Conference shows, have confined that section to

15

pre-certification interference with the organization of

16

unions, or with an egregious threat to the

17

representation function of a union.

18

Certainly Respondent cites no case in which

19

Section 2 Fourth has been construed as broader in scope

20

than the NLRA provisions.

21

under the NLRA have made it very clear that even though

22

the filling of places left vacant by strikers may have a

23

coercive effect on the exercise of the right to strike,

24

it is not prohibited coercion.

25

And this Court's decisions

Congress permitted that effect as part of the
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

intended balance between the exercise of self-help by

2

employer and employees.
The remainder of Respondent's argument about

3
4

the RLA is that this Court's decision in Florida East

5

Coast Railway -- of course the Court is familiar with

6

that decision, and the discussion of it which we had in

7

the case which we refer to as TWA 1, which is still

8

pending, petition for rehearing in this Court.

9

Respondent says that that decision requires the

The

10

continuation of pre-strike working conditions into and

11

beyond the self-help period.
Respondent argues that therefore the seniority

12
13

system as it refers to it, in the 1981-84 contract

14

between TWA and IFFA, which the District Court held did

15

not include any right of unreinstated strikers to

16

displace incumbents -- that that seniority system

17

somehow expands because of the statute to confer that

18

right of displacement after the expiration date of the

19

contract.
In other words, Respondent says that a right

20
21

conferred neither by contract nor by statute somehow is

22

born from the interplay of that contract and that

23
24
25

statute.
QUESTION:

You would argue that even if you

lose TWA 1, you win this?

1

MR. GARTNER:

2

QUESTION:

Yes , sir.

But even if the -- even if the

3

contract does subsist, there is no right in that

4

contract of the sort that was the basis for the decision

5

here?
MR. GARTNER:

6
7

Scalia, we would.
As a matter of fact, we argued in TWA 1, as

8
9

Yes, Your Honor, yes, Justice

Your Honor

is aware,

that FEC does not require the

10

continuation of contracts which have expired by their

11

terms.

12

carrier the obligation to observe a seniority right not

13

granted by the contract.

But even if it did,

it could not impose on the

14

And clearly if this Court should hold that the

15

contract including all of the seniority provisions which

16

it did have has expired, there then cannot be any basis

17

on which to say that because those particular and

18

limited seniority provisions once existed, seniority

19

principles in Respondents' words require the carrier

20

the self-help period to allow unreinstated strikers to

21

displace incumbent employees.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Gartner,

in

I got the impression

23

that the Eighth Circuit decision in what you called TWA

24

1 depended more than its decision in this case did upon

25

its construction of the contract.

Am I right or wrong

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

on that?
MR. GARTNER:

2

Your Honor, we thought you were

3

wrong, and we argued that at that time, that the Eighth

4

Circuit clearly said in that decision that the

5

construction of the contract was driven by its

6

interpretation of the statutes.
QUESTION:

7

Yes, I remember that from TWA 1, I

8

think.

9

in this case as putting that much emphasis on the

10

But I didn't read the Eighth Circuit's opinion

contract.
MR. GARTNER:

11
12

Oh, well, I'm sorry.

I

misunderstood the question.
I think that's correct.

13

The Eighth Circuit,

14

however, relied upon the survival of the Union Security

15

Clause, which was one result of its decision in TWA 1.

16

But the Respondent has now disavowed that ground for the

17

decision.

18

irrelevant, and we agree.

19

Respondent says in his brief that that's

The -- as things stand, it appears that

20

Congress left the resolution of whatever disputes remain

21

after the stage of economic warfare to agreement by the

22

parties, and here there was no back-to-work agreement.

23

As this Court said in Burlington Northern, if

24

the statute does not deal with the subject, it is for

25

Congress, not for this Court, to establish rules to
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

govern the exercise of self-help.
On the other hand, if the Court discerns in

2
3

some language of the RLA some intent by Congress to

4

confer rights on strikers, in the absence of expressed

5

language, legislative history or other guidelines, and

6

in view of the different provisions in the two statutes,

7

Congress cannot have intended those rights to be greater

8

than the rights which the Court has held exist under the

9

NLRA.

QUESTION:

Well, in your view, could you have

11

entered a contract requiring replacement of the

crossover strikers by the full-time strikers?

Well, then it doesn't follow that

by statute there's a right to -- to reinstatement.

15

The statute by itself doesn't grant that

All right.

Yes.
Then it must follow

that the statute does not give a right to the crossover

QUESTION:

It's not a question of

Well, did they have a right to

those jobs, when they sought them?
MR. GARTNER:

Of course.

They were permanent

20

employees when they were -- before the strike, and they

21

came back to their jobs.

22

QUESTION:

I don't see how that's consistent

23

with your view that by contract you could have

24

stipulated otherwise.

25

MR. GARTNER:

Because the union is the

representative, or it claims to be the representative,

2

of all of the employees, and if the union decides that

3

it wants to negotiate to favor some of its people on the

4

basis of seniority, if that's the basis of which they

5

choose, they are the representative.

6

right to enter into that kind of an agreement.

They have the

That does not mean that the company would not

7

8

still be liable in state court for the promises which it

9

made to the new hires and the crossovers that we would

10

not enter into such a contract.

That was the promise

11

that we made, that TWA made to them, that we would not

12

enter into such a contract.
And we're not -- we are not arguing that the

13
14

crossovers have a statutory right to their job.

15

simply saying that they are in the job, and the union

16

has no claim to displace them by statute.
QUESTION:

17

We're

But if you -- let's take it a step

further.

demand, just on the facts of this case, with no contract

provision, there would be no statutory violation?

If you acceded at this point to the union's

MR. GARTNER:

There might be a violation of

the duty to represent, to fairly represent the employees.
QUESTION:

So far as the employer, the

employer would not be violating the statute?
MR. GARTNER:

I don't -- from the standpoint
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

of the employer, I don't believe there would be a

2

statutory violation.

3
4
5

QUESTION:

So then this is not a case where

the employer is caught between two conflicting duties?
MR. GARTNER:

Well, it is, because he's caught

6

between the conflicting obligation which he has to the

7

crossovers and to the new hires that he had promised

8

them that he would not enter into such a contract.

9
10

It's one phase of Belknap v. Hale.
QUESTION:

All right, then the duty arises

11

only because of the promise that the employer makes, and

12

that doesn't tell us whether or not what the employer

13

promised was legally binding.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Gartner, were there any

15

employees here who were on strike and then volunteered

16

to come back to work, but couldn't be hired because

17

there were no vacancies?

18
19

MR. GARTNER:

Not while the strike was on,

Justice O'Connor.

20

I have -- I'd like to reserve the rest of my

21

time, if I may, simply with the comment that there has

22

not been any sound reason advanced why the rule as to

23

the rights of crossovers to their jobs should be

24

different under the RLA and under the NLRA, creating a

25

dichotomy in national labor policy.

We'll hear now from you, Mr. Robbins.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE S. ROBBINS

8

AS AMICUS CURIAE FOR THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

Thank you, Mr. Gartner.

MR. ROBBINS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Justice Kennedy, I'd like to begin by

12

addressing the question that you were asking at the

13

outset to my co-counsel.

14

The fact is that although the statute does

15

plainly create a right in the crossovers to return to

16

their job, a right that we think is fairly entailed by

17

this Court's decision in Fleetwood and in the Board's

18

decision in Laidlaw, that right, like many other rights,

19

are waivable, and it is waivable by virtue of the

20

union's duty to represent all employees, crossovers,

21

full time strikers alike.

22
23
24
25

The collective bargaining agreement is the
form in which the waiver takes place, and if the waiver
is articulated in that collective bargaining agreement,
the crossovers have no claim, unless it's a claim
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

against their union for a breach of their duty to

2

represent all employees fairly and equitably.

3

But the mere fact that an agreement, a

4

collective bargaining agreement can waive that right

5

does not mean that there's no underlying right to be

6

waived, and it's our position that indeed there is.

7

There's no inconsistency.

8

implicit in this Court's decision in Belknap, and in

9

particular footnote 8 of Belknap.

I think this point is fairly

And the Board has

10

recognized in some of its decisions that this is a right

11

that's waivable, and yet the right exists.

12

QUESTION:

Is it waivable only by contract?

13

MR. ROBBINS:

I believe that the only

14

circumstances that I know of, or that the employer may

15

displace the crossovers if he agrees to do so by

16

collective bargaining agreement, or alternatively -- and

17

this is of course not this case -- if the strike was an

18

unfair labor practice strike, in which case the unfair

19

labor practice strikers have a right of reinstatement

20

and a right to bump the crossovers or the new -- and the

21

new hires, notwithstanding the Mackay decision.

22

We are here today on behalf of the Labor Board

23

because the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit,

24

although this case arises under the Railway Labor Act,

25

decided it under principles established by the National
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Labor Relations Act.
Now, Respondents may well be correct to disown

2
3

that basis for the decision, but assuming that the NLRA

4

principles do apply, it is the Labor Board's view that

5

the Court of Appeals applied that statute in an odd and

6

untenable way.
In this Court's Mackay decision, and for 50

7

8

years since, two propositions have been firmly settled

9

under the NLRA.

First, an employer is entitled to hire

10

replacements for economics strikers and to offer them

11

permanent status.
Second, the employer is not obligated to

12
13

dismiss those replacements at the end of the strike by

14

bumping them, as it were, in favor of strikers who wish

15

to return. Rather, as the Mackay case makes clear, an

16

employer need only reinstate -- and I'm quoting -- "so

17

many of the strikers as there were vacant places to be

18

filled."

19

In our view, the Court of Appeals

20

misunderstood those principles by drawing a distinction

21

for purposes of the Mackay rule, between so-called

22

crossover employees and new hires.

23
24
25

The Court of Appeals held that TWA could
indeed lawfully replace the strikers with new hires, but
that it could not do so in the case of the crossover
17
ALDERSOIM REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

employees, who in the Court's view had to be discharged

2

to make room for the returning full-time strikers.

3

We believe that distinction cannot be squared

4

with the Mackay decision.

5

in the facts of Mackay, because in Mackay, after all,

6

the strikers in that case were replaced by other company

7

employees who were based in other company offices, at a

8

time when the entire workforce of the company was

9

supposed to be on strike.

10

Certainly it finds no basis

And it's fair to say, therefore, that Mackay

11

itself dealt with crossovers, yet there's no intimation

12

in this Court's opinion in Mackay that that fact made

13

any difference at all.

14

Appeals' distinction find any basis in the purpose of

15

the Mackay ruling.

16

Nor, we think, does the Court of

The Mackay rule, as the Court said in the

17

decision, is based on the employer's "right to protect

18

and continue his business by supplying places left

19

vacant by strikers."

20

justify drawing the distinction that the Court of

21

Appeals drew. An employer may well need to draw on both

22

sources of employees to run his business during an

23

economic strike.

That purpose, we suggest, does not

24

Indeed, in an industry like the airline

25

industry, which is of course safety sensitive and
18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

effected with an important public purpose, it's rather

2

odd to suppose that the employer is relegated only to

3

replace the strikers with new hires -- people who've

4

never worked in the industry before, perhaps, instead of

5

making use of the experienced pre-strike workers who

6

either stayed on the job or returned early.

7

Now, the Court of Appeals based its decision

8

not on these principles, but on a notion of

9

discrimination. It viewed the decision of TWA as in

10

effect a discrimination on the basis of union activity.

11

That thesis, we believe, makes no sense once you

12

recognize that MAckay itself involved the same kind of

13

discrimination -- a discrimination in favor of new hires

14

who were replacing the full-term strikers.

15

And it's impossible to see how the Court of

16

Appeals decision would not equally apply to the decision

17

to replace the full-term strikers with new hires.

18

too, in that case, could it be said that that is a

19

discrimination on the basis of union activity, but no

20

one, not the Respondents nor the Court of Appeals is

21

pressing that proposition on this Court today.

22
23

So,

The Court of Appeals anchored its decision in
Erie Resistor, but we believe the analogy cannot hold.

24

There, unlike here, the employer chose a novel and

25

rather extreme form of, in a sense a punishment, by
19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

awarding 20 years-' of super-seniority, which worked

2

against all strikers, not just those who were replaced

3

and had a long term effect on the workforce, both before

4

and after the strike was completed.

5

What's more, the Court of Appeals' decision

6

has the anomalous consequence, we believe, of treating

7

crossover employees who may have many years on the job,

8

more unfavorably than new hires.

9

Court of Appeals concluded, were entitled to permanent

The new hires, the

10

status -- the crossovers were not, despite the many

11

years they may have had on the job.

12

13
14

We can find no basis in the Mackay decision
for that kind of result.
Indeed, the crossovers have a claim that the

15

new hires do not.

16

were permanent employees before the strike, they are

17

permanent employees after the strike, and as we read the

18

Fleetwood decision and the Laidlaw decision of the Board

19

which followed on this Court's Fleetwood decision, it

20

would have in fact been an unfair labor practice for the

21

employer to have denied the crossover employees their

22

jobs back, to have deprived them of full-term status.

23

They have a claim of right.

They

And the Court of Appeals' construction of the

24

NLRA, assuming it is indeed applicable here, has the

25

curious feature of requiring the employer to violate the
20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

law in order to avoid this discrimination that is

2

alleged to persist.

3

the statute so inside-out as to reach a result of that

4

sor t.

5

We think it makes no sense to turn

In short, we believe, there is simply no

6

warrant under the NLRA for ousting the crossovers from

7

the permanent positions that they had always enjoyed.

That's correct.

They were not

that way, in effect, the burden of the strike and the

18

MR. ROBBINS:

That's true, but a layoff

19

affects all persons and is a decision of the employer.

consequence of other people's striking decisions being

that you're entitled, with respect to the crossovers -21

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, no, we don't think that it

operates in quite that way.
QUESTION:

They --

Well, the employer kept them on.

They wanted to stay on, and they stayed on.
MR. ROBBINS:

That's correct, and we believe

that that was their right under the statute.

The only

10

reason they've been ousted is because other employees,

11

exercising their rights to be sure, let the strike go on

12

long enough to be replaced themselves.

13

Now, at the end of the strike, in the absence

14

of a back-to-work agreement, they would have the

15

foreseeable consequences of that NLRA protected

16

decision, be in a sense reallocated to other employees

17

who themselves were exercising their right not to strike.

QUESTION:

But they have to claim, in order to

overcome the returning strikers' seniority, they have to

use the same argument that the new hires use, I suppose?

the employer's entitled to do when you have a war.

MR. ROBBINS:

No, I don't think so.

I think the finding of the

Mr. Hurley, we'll hear now from you.

12

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. HURLEY

13

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

14
15
16

MR. HURLEY:

Thank you, Mr. Robbins.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
I'd first like to try to set a couple of

17

things straight, based on what I heard on the other side

18

here this afternoon.

19

First of all, we are not attempting to claim

20

that under the RLA, the right to strike should have a

21

greater protection than it does under the NLRA.

22

-- neither are we necessarily disowning, as the

23

We are

Solicitor General put it, NLRA precedent that the Eighth

24

Circuit utilized in its decision in finding that TWA

25

violated the RLA.
23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

For, as this Court knows, NLRA precedent,

1

2

especially in an area where under the RLA case authority

3

has not sufficiently developed, can be quite useful, can

4

be conceptually useful as long as careful analogies are

5

drawn.

6

precedent utilized by the lower court, in our opinion,

7

was right on point, especially the case of Erie Resistor

8

and the parallels that the lower court drew from this

9

Court's decision in that particular case.

10

And I think it bears repeating that the NLRA

Now, having said that, we readily acknowledge

11

that the RLA does not contain express limitations in the

12

Act concerning the parties' use of self-help measures.

13

But this Court has held that the parties' use of

14

self-help is not totally unlimited.

15

fact, in the Jacksonville Terminal decision, this Court

16

held that while the parties may utilize the full measure

17

of peaceful economic action as self-help, it cannot do

18

os if that self-help conflicts with any other statutory

19

obligation.

QUESTION:

Would you just -- you say that's

the holding of Florida East Coast?

MR. HURLEY:

MR. HURLEY:

25

As a matter of

Well, I -You said "held."

East Coast, I misspoke.

I'm sorry.

Florida East Coast

Now, one of these statutory obligations, we

5

maintain, and apparently we have a very fundamental

7

disagreement with counsel for TWA -- one of these

8

statutory obligations, we maintain, is the right to

9

strike.

It is protected under the RLA, and under

10

section 2 Fourth this Court again, in Jacksonville

11

Terminal, made it quite clear that the employees' right

12

to strike is a core RLA right.

13

Act.

It is integral to the

14

In fact, other courts have described the right

15

to strike in an RLA context as it has in the NLRA -- one

16

of the union's more cherished weapons.

17

So, we maintain that there can be no question

18

of the obligation under section 2 Fourth on the part of

19

a carrier to avoid influencing or coercing the

20

employees' right to strike through the use of self-help

21

measures.

22
23

QUESTION:
MR. HURLEY:

You mean like hiring replacements?
Well, hiring permanent

24

replacements is an exception to the statutory rule under

25

2 Fourth, as it is under the NLRA section 883.
25

It has

been deemed

QUESTION:

3

MR. HURLEY:

Why is it?
Because when this Court, in

4

Mackay, balanced the two conflicting rights, it deemed

6

case -- it nevertheless deemed that the right of the

7

employer to operate its business by hiring new hire

MR. HURLEY:

And wouldn't that -- why isn't that

of factual circumstances.

QUESTION:

23

At the conclusion of the strike,

I think the employer's right to

24

MR. HURLEY:

But I think it has to be

25

carefully balanced, against the

expressed statutory

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

right that employees have to be free from employer

2

retaliation when it engages in one of the critical

3

aspects of union --

4

QUESTION:

5

But the Court balanced that in

Mackay.
MR. HURLEY:

6

That's correct, Mr. Chief

7

Justice, and I have no quarrel with the balance at this

8

point that this Court drew in Mackay.
We're not talking about the right of the

9
10

permanent new-hire replacements to have and keep jobs at

11

the conclusion of the strike.

12

QUESTION:

Your opponent says that the people

13

who were used as replacements in Mackay were actually

14

employees of the company, not just people taken off the

15

street.

16

MR. HURLEY:

I disagree with that assessment,

17

and I've looked at the facts as carefully as I can in

18

Mackay. It's not particularly clear when you read both

19

the Board's decision in the original Mackay case and

20

this Court's decision, exactly what the facts were.

21

if I could quote in the NLRB's Erie Resistor decision,

22

which this Court approved, it interpreted -- the Board

23
24
25

But

interpreted -- Mackay as follows:
"An employer during an economic strike, is
permitted to secure new employees or employees outside

There were crossovers involved.
Weren't they allowed to keep their

1

the Court in Erie Resistor.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. HURLEY:

Well -The issue of super-seniority and

4

the devastating effect that that particular benefit that

5

was promised to the crossovers was at issue.
QUESTION:

6

Well, I know, but on your theory,

7

the crossovers in Erie shouldn't have kept their jobs at

8

all.

9

MR. HURLEY:

That's correct.

If it had been

10

raised, that's what the counsel for the union, I think,

11

would have been arguing.

But it was not raised.

12

Now, I think it's clear --

13

QUESTION:

14
15
16
17
18

Did the Court in, perhaps, dictum

say anything about that?
MR. HURLEY:
but it had not.

I wish that it had, Your Honor,

It did not.

(Laughter)
QUESTION:

Would you explain to me -- never

19

mind the precedent -- why it is that hiring a new

20

employee impermissibly trenches upon the right to strike

21

of those that have chosen to do so?

22
23
24
25

MR. HURLEY:
QUESTION:

Hiring a new hire?
Yes, impermissibly interferes with

that right to strike but keeping on a crossover who
chooses to stay on -- I'm sorry, does not impermissibly,
29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

whereas keeping on a crossover does.

2

the one worse than the other?
MR. HURLEY:

3

Why does -- why is

Because I think in the latter

4

case, the case, the question we're arguing, where

5

promises are made to crossovers who are members of the

6

pre-strike working force and the striking community --

7

those promises unlike the promise of permanence to the

8

new hires, an outside group -- those promises to the

9

crossovers, they impact upon the striking group seeking

10

to divide that group and to create individual

11

competition among the striking group, to abandon the

12

strike.
QUESTION:

13

Well, that's a different argument.

14

That isn't punishing somebody for striking, any more

15

than something else.

16

well

17

MR. HURLEY:

This is an argument that it --

Well, the result of promising

18

that they would be able to retain their jobs in the

19

post-strike workforce, that result is that when

20

full-term strikers who exercise their right to fully

21

engage in strikes ask for reinstatement, they are denied

22

that reinstatement because of the previous -- what we

23

maintain -- illegal promises made to these crossovers by

24

the employers.

25

QUESTION:

Is there a right not to strike, as
30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

2

well as
MR. HURLEY:

Yes.

There is an individual

3

right that employees have under both Acts to refrain

4

from engaging in union activities.

5

QUESTION:

Don't you think it punishes the

6

right -- exercises the right not to strike, to tell

7

somebody you're welcome not to, but you're going to pay

8

whatever cost the strike entails anyway, whether you

9

choose not to or not.

10
11

Doesn't the punish the exercise

of the right not to strike?
MR. HURLEY:

No, I don't think the arguments

12

that we make infringes upon the individual right to

13

refrain, because number one, the employee is free to

14

refrain from striking at any time and return to his or

15

her job and earn his or her livelihood during the

16

pendency of the strike. And if he or she has sufficient

17

seniority or whatever neutral basis the employer should

18

use, that person may very well remain in the active

19

workforce after the strike.

20

QUESTION:

Maybe, but surely the biggest risk

21

of a strike for an employee is that the employee will be

22

replaced entirely and there will be no job left when the

23
24
25

strike is over -- isn't that the biggest risk?
MR. HURLEY:
QUESTION:

That is one of the risks.
And you are telling the employee
31

ALDERSOIM REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

who stays on, and chooses not to strike, that even

2

though you stay on, and choose not to strike, the

3

biggest risk of the strike will be visited upon you.

4

you are the last in the order of seniority, and there is

5

one new hire or one new employee put, one new hire,

6

you're the one who's going to be bounced because of it.

7

Now, why isn't that punishing that employee's decision

8

not to strike?

9

MR. HURLEY:

If

Well, because, to put the shoe on

10

the other foot, if the employer is also telling those

11

who want to exercise fully their right to strike that

12

they will most likely not only be replaced by permanent,

13

new hire replacements, but also by early returning

14

strikers because they chose to show fealty to the

15

company at an earlier point, that they will not be

16

allowed to keep their jobs, is blatant discrimination

17

for engaging in union activities.

18

And so this balancing has to occur, and we

19

argue in this case that the violation is because TWA did

20

not use a neutral basis in determining, in distributing

21

the post-strike active workforce jobs, beyond those in

22

which permanent new hire replacements were in, and could

23

not be displaced.

24

lower court used, was the most appropriate neutral basis

25

that they could have utilized.

And we argue that seniority as the

32
ALDERSOIM REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

TWA did not do so, and indeed trumpeted the

2

fact even before the strike began that they were not

3

going to use any neutral basis, or continue to use the

4

seniority system.

5

going to use a system that would favor the early

6

abandonment of the strike. If you did not go in and get

7

your job early, you might risk the chance of losing it

8

for engaging in the strike full-term.

9

They announced early that they were

So, we really feel that the real question here

10

is not whether this activity, this conduct on the part

11

of TWA is coercive, as we clearly think it is, but

12

whether there is any reason that this type of coercion

13

should be somehow privileged under the RLA as the hiring

14

of new hire replacements under the Mackay rule would

15

appear to be under the RLA.

16
17

QUESTION:

Mr. Hurley, can I interrupt you

with a question?

18

MR. HURLEY:

19

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice Stevens.
As I understand it, a crossover

20

with a great deal of seniority might retain the job even

21

under the Court of Appeals' holding.

22
23
24
25

MR. HURLEY:
QUESTION:

Is that right?

Yes, absolutely.
Do we know how many of the

crossovers -- under the Court of Appeals' holding, how
many of the crossovers will retain their jobs, and how
33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

many will lose them to strikers?
MR. HURLEY:

2
3

seniority?

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. HURLEY:

6

Based upon the application of

Yes.
The numbers were not gone into

during the litigation, in terms of the breakdown.

7

It's difficult for me to speculate, although I

8

would represent that there would be a significant number

9

of crossovers, not an insignificant number, at least,

10

that would have remained, based upon their seniority

11

standing.

12

QUESTION:

On the theory that they would -- by

13

remaining, they would in effect jump ahead of those who

14

otherwise would have seniority over them?

15

MR. HURLEY:

Well, under the theory that we

16

argue, and which the lower court upheld, I was answering

17

your question.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. HURLEY:

20

Yes.
But there would be a significant

number of crossovers that would not have been displaced.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. HURLEY:

Yes.
As I said earlier, I think that

23

the -- unlike under the NLR, where the NLRB balances

24

these conflicting interests, the Federal Courts are

25

called upon, under the RLA, to engage in this
34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

balancing.

And I think one has to not only refer to

2

NLRA precedent, as I previously mentioned, in this

3

balancing process, but one has to refer to the Florida

4

East Coast case, that I earlier had misspoken about.
The Florida East Coast case provides a

5

6

conceptual backdrop for our argument.

7

Coast decision illustrated the strong Congressional

8

concern that Congress had for labor stability under the

9

RLA.

10

The Florida East

It clearly emphasized in regard to this labor

11

stability concern that it was served by certain

12

continuity factors -- continuity of the existing rules

13

governing the striking community that had not been

14

previously placed in the Act's bargaining processes,

work for his union activities, then I think that would

be a violation.

QUESTION:

Well, he just says "I'm not hiring

crossovers.

I'm not going to take back crossovers.

that case the Supreme Court decided."

MR. HURLEY:

circumstances, Justice White, whether that would be

13

that they should, that the reinstatement of these

14

crossovers to jobs may be subject to defeasance, namely

15

if the crossover's seniority or any other basis that is

16

fair, say, would not hold that person's position.

QUESTION:

I can't conceive that the

19

more seniority?

MR. HURLEY:

I certainly think that's what

we're arguing for.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. HURLEY:

I mean he could expressly?
I think so.

I think that could

24

be made clear, that when a crossover comes back, he has

25

no guarantees but rather may be subject to displacement

1

based on some neutral basis that the employer is going

2

to utilize, and I certainly think seniority would be one

3

of those.

4

QUESTION:

So it's really plausible to have

5

this sort of conversation between two union members, one

6

of whom has a lot of seniority and one of whom has

7

virtually none.

8

the former tells him, "Well, you're welcome to go back

9

in, if you want, but you'll just be holding my job for

The latter does not want a strike, and

10

me, because as soon as this strike's over, I'm going to

11

take it, and you'll be laid off."

12

MR. HURLEY:

That would depend upon whether

13

there were any permanent replacements, new hire

14

permanent replacements hired.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. HURLEY:

Quite so.
And essentially that's true,

17

because in most industrial situations, most plants or

18

whatever, especially having collective bargaining

19

agreements, when there are not enough jobs to go around,

20

usually collective bargaining agreements provide for

21

seniority to determine who gets the available job, and

22

not any basis such as what TWA used.

23
24
25

In that vivid example that you put forth, I
think that basically the senior striker is saying "I'm
not going to be penalized merely because you go in early

MR. HURLEY:

in which a carrier cannot, in accordance with the

dictates of the Florida East Coast decision, cannot

demonstrate that there is a real need to offer

Now, I would like to also address briefly the

15

notion that counsel for TWA and the Board raises

16

concerning the fact that there seems to be some sort of

17

anomalous result created by the ruling below.

18

I want to emphasize that what we urge here --

19

what we argue for -- is the application of one standard

20

approach, or analysis, but to diverse circumstances, two

21

entirely different sets of circumstances.

22

We are talking about the promises made to

crossovers which involve different factual matters, and

which call for a different, but certainly not an

Even the NLRB recognizes certain fundamental

distinctions under the NLRA in the way an employer can

treat new hire permanent replacements during a strike

4

versus its treatment of crossovers who cross over and

5

also work during a strike.

the new hire replacements and does not commit an unfair

14

MR. HURLEY:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. HURLEY:

I don't read it as that.
But -- but that's the result.
I think the result is that the

17

Board says that crossovers must be treated under the

18

terms that exist even throughout the strike that were

19

established in the previous collective bargaining

20

agreement -- that no alternations can be made in those

21

terms as they apply to working crossovers unless they

22

are bargained about with the crossovers' collective

23

bargaining rep.

24
25

QUESTION:

Whereas you wouldn't have to treat

new hires that favorably?
43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

MR. HURLEY:

1

2

During the strike, that is

correct, Mr. Chief Justice.
We say that the Mackay rule created an

3
4

apparently permissible division or conflict between a

5

group of outside workers, outside people, and the

6

striking workforce as a whole, in competition for

7

post-strike jobs. The balance tipped in that instance in

8

favor of the employer for the reasons I've already spoke.
But the decision below recognized that Mackay

9
10

was not intended to allow the employer to also create,

11

or in addition create a division among the striking

12

workforce, and that's where they analyzed and applied

13

the principles in Erie Resistor, and we think correctly.

14

In the post-strike distribution of jobs in the

15

active workforce, the employer has to use a neutral

16

basis, a non-discriminatory basis, and that's exactly

17

what TWA did not do here.
Under the decision below, the result is that

18
19

neither the crossovers nor the full-time strikers are

20

totally shut out of post-strike jobs in the active

21

workforce.

MR. GARTNER:

But the seniority --

And they had permanent jobs too.
-- is not an issue in this case.

22

As Mr. Hurley said, seniority is a creature of

23

collective bargaining agreement, and normally what

24

happens after a strike is that you have a collective

25

bargaining agreement known as a back-to-work agreement.
46
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

There was no such back-to-work agreement here.

The District Court found that the original contract,

whether it expired or not doesn't matter, did not

something which is a neutral principle, as Mr. Hurley

says.

to work as a new hire.

3

Now, that is something that Laidlaw says is an

4

unfair labor practice, to force a crossover to come back

as a temporary employee or to give up his seniority

rights when he comes back, and yet that's what the union

says has to happen in this case.

then the union can't use their so-called seniority.

apply in this situation, and there is no discrimination
