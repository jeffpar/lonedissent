ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOIS G. WILLIAMS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. WILLIAMS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
In the Customs program at issue today, large

13

numbers of innocent people are subjected to what they

14

regard as a degrading and embarrassing search of their

15

urine when the government has no reason to believe that

16

they are guilty of any drug use and when the government

17

admits that it does not expect to find significant

18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

evidence of such misconduct in these searches.

We will

argue, therefore, that these suspicionless searches are
unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.
I'd like to consider first today the
government's justification for this search because under
any analysis the Court may employ, the government must
have a need to intrude upon the privacy of its citizens,
even its employees.

And if that need does not exist, if

it is not -- if the search is not justified, even a
minor intrusion cannot be justified.

Therefore, the --

the government argues that this is a minor intrusion.

I

would like to -- to address the intrusion question
second.
Now, the government recites an interest in
this case in a drug-free work force.

But on this

record, as we will show, that interest is already met
and it is not threatened.

And in that event, the

government has failed to establish any need to undertake
new and intrusive searches beyond the many tools it
already possesses, let alone searches without any
individualized suspicion whatever.
May I turn then to what the record actually
shows about the origins of this program?
QUESTION:

(Inaudible) be a warrant --

MS. WILLIAMS:
QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor --

-- on that basis.

MS. WILLIAMS:

We have -- we have -- the

government has never really made an argument that it
should be freed of the traditional requirements of the
Fourth Amendment.
QUESTION:

Well, are you arguing that in order

to justify these tests that there must be a warrant?
MS. WILLIAMS:

I -- we have -- we did preserve
4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

that argument, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

2
3

Well, do you -- is that what

you're
MS. WILLIAMS:

4

But we are not -- we do not

5

believe that the Court would require a warrant in this

6

circumstance.
QUESTION:

MS. WILLIAMS:

12

So, individualized -But --

-- suspicion would be enough even

though there the government has plenty of other ways to
do this?
MS. WILLIAMS:

Well, let ne suggest I -- I

13

really believe that this -- these searches ought to be

14

conducted only on probable cause.

15

willing to -- to see that the warrant requirement is a

16

-- is a bit different.

17

that's because in a suspicion circumstance, we have a

20

22
23
24
25

The -- I am perfectly

And I -- although I think -- and

more imminent situation.
In this situation, however, we have people who
have done nothing.

There is no triggering event of any

sort which would suggest that a warrant requirement
could be abandoned.

I mean, usually it's justified in

abandoning the warrant requirement when there are some
sort of exigencies.

And when you are looking at people

who have given you no cause at all, it is rather more
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

like the situation where at least some sort of area-wide

2

warrant or work force-wide warrant might be obtained.

3

I frankly believe that that is less --

4

QUESTION:

5

MS. WILLIAMS:

6

-- far less important than the

-- than the requirement of cause.
QUESTION:

7

8

Would a work force --

Would a work force-wide warrant

really be of any benefit to -- to your clients here?
MS. WILLIAMS:

9

Your Honor, it -- it -- I am

10

perfectly satisfied that the -- the warrant would give

11

very little more than we already have, which is why we

16

20
21

22

24
25

don't place great stock in it.

But the analysis to be

sound -- true to the analysis, normally the government
would have to justify abandoning the traditional
requirements.

It hasn't really made that argument in

this case..
But the regularity of the procedure is not
really the problem in this case.

The problem is in

taking people who have done nothing for which they can
be criticized.

Indeed, the selection of this group is

almost perverse because they have recently been examined
and their work record evaluated.

They are current

employees, many with long histories, who have been
selected for promotion.

It -- they would appear to be

on common sense the least likely to create any problem

for the Customs Service.
QUESTION:

2

Mr. Williams, how -- how do you

3

reconcile the notion of the need for particularized

4

suspicion with the requirements that -- you know, when

5

we think of these privacy cases, I suppose every federal

6

judge thinks of the annual financial disclosures that

7

every federal judge has to file every year showing all

8

-- all income received by the judge and by his spouse

9

and children.

10

Now, is there -- is your position that

that is invalid or -- or is there -MS. WILLIAMS:

11

QUESTION:

12

No.

-- some reason why that invasion of

13

privacy, which is much greater because that goes to the

14

entire public, whereas these -- these tests just go to

15

-- are not published, of course.

16

public.
MS. WILLIAMS:

17
18
19
20
21

They don't become

Well, it is true, indeed, Your

Honor, that there are many invasions of privacy that we
suffer.

But I take it even a federal judge, who is

subjected to the most rigorous scrutiny and who
discloses -- who permits disclosure of financial records

22

and even medical records and the like, might well object

23

if it -- if it were announced that his home should be

24
25

subject to search or that his desk perhaps should be
subject to search.

This is a search.

That's the

7

1

difference.
QUESTION:

If you're asking me to decide this

3

on -- if you're asking me to decide this on the basis of

4

whether it's a greater invasion of privacy that -- that

I should give a urine sample when I'm up for a promotion

or a transfer versus whether I should publish my entire
financial background every year, you're going to lose.
(Laughter.)
MS. WILLIAMS:

That's right.

That's why I

would not make that argument.
(Laughter .)
QUESTION:

Well, then â€”

(Laughter.)
MS. WILLIAMS:
QUESTION:

It is -- there are --

I thought -- I thought you just had.

MS. WILLIAMS:

No, there are --

(Laughter.)
MS. WILLIAMS:

There are very -- there are

many very substantial intrusions that are not searches
within the Fourth Amendment.

We do suffer those, and I

think in the -- the problem in the employment context is
perhaps we feel that we have opened ourselves to
practically every question, and we have practically no
privacy left when we're applying for a promotion in a
job, let us say. But that's not so because all of us
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

would draw lines at being personally searched even

2

though we -- we do permit vast disclosures of our

3

private information.

4

distinguishes this from the many other privacy invasions

5

involved.

That personal search is what

And let me say that when those other areas of

6
7

privacy are yielded up, there is even less justification

8

for the search of this sort because we have disclosed,

9

in fact, so much.

Do -- does society really require

10

this further indignity that is wrought upon us?

11

the justification decreases in that situation rather

12
13

I think

than saying, well, we've -- we've -- we've let our
privacy go. We have no expectation left.
QUESTION:

14

Do you think that a periodic

15

physical inspection, including urine and blood tests for

16

employees, for example, engineers of trains or pilots of

17

airplanes, is not a reasonable requirement on an ongoing

18

basis?

19

20
21

22

MS. WILLIAMS:

Yes.

I think it may be a

reasonable requirement in -- in the right sort of
safety-connected jobs.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't the government's

23

argument here that these are in a sense safety-connected

24

jobs at stake in the Customs Service.

25

out there in the field trying to stop the flow of drugs

into this country, for example -- should they not -- is
there no heightened concern for those employees that
they also be drug-free, not users or abusers of drugs
themselves?
MS. WILLIAMS:

and I think these are the kind of employees for which we
might ask is -- is probable cause required or might we
do some kinds of searches on reasonable suspicion.
QUESTION:

MS. WILLIAMS:

11

There is a heightened concern,

that in a situation like this where we have a 200-year

12

old agency and no incident in this record -- none -- no

-- it is --

-- do we know how many applying for

MS. WILLIAMS:

Ms. Williams --

We have -- the record -- the

record in the case shows that at the time the case was

decided in the Court of Appeals, there were

And we -- we have before us

So, we â€” we know at most it was

I have no information about what has been done

But I would say with the size of the Customs

Service, even if you assumed that every single one of

3

those was a current employee and we tested everybody

QUESTION;

Of course, we don't know how many

might have not applied for promotion or might have left
the Service because they simply could not get rid of a
drug habit which they knew would turn up in these tests.
MS. WILLIAMS:
QUESTION:

Yes.

There's no way --

MS. WILLIAMS:

We do not know that.

But we

have, as I say -QUESTION:

And that's really the crucial

figure, isn't it?
MS. WILLIAMS:

Yes.

that question of deterrence.

But -- but let's look at
When -- it 's very

difficult to evaluate that when we've had no problem
that we know of ever.

So, when we talk about deterrence

as a feature of the government's argument, I think it's
very easy to say -- and it's impossible to evaluate.
One can't really speak meaningfully of deterring a
non-problem.

First of all, the tests would have to be

highly effective I think to serve as an effective
deterrent. And as we've argued in our brief, this
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

particular test is unusually ineffective since it's

2

given one time and on -- on several days' notice.
But in any event, there's nothing in the

3
4

record that would help us evaluate the deterrent effect

5

and note the -- the argument that the government makes

6

allows it to claim success either way.

sense.

If we catch any

was a problem.

There

It was a -- it was a terrible problem.

And we knew it, and we could see it, and we could
measure it. And when magnetometers were instituted all
around the country, we no longer had to think when we
got on an airplane am I going to end up in Cuba at this
time.
QUESTION:

But must the government wait until

the dimension is that of a terrible problem?
MS. WILLIAMS:
QUESTION:

No.

Can't it anticipate?

MS. WILLIAMS:

It could anticipate it, but it
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

has to be a reasonable anticipation.

2

it's very clear that -- that it has many tools to see

3

whether it has the kind of problem it purports to look

4

for.

5

whose sole reason for being is to investigate the

6

conduct of its employees and it does that with a

7

vengeance.

8
9
10
11
12

This agency has --

It has a very aggressive internal affairs division

And it never has turned up any of the kinds

of problems that the Commissioner refers to related to
employee drug abuse.
Moreover, the Commissioner himself said drug
abuse would create these problems in the work force.
And he points to things like theft, health insurance,

13

accidents, lowered productivity, morale problems though

14

every one of those is a visible manifestation.

15

look at the work force and you can see whether you have

16

those sorts of problems.

17

as the basis for individualized suspicion.

You can

And you can perhaps use those

I suggest the analysis this Court employed in
Delaware v. Prouse is very appropriate here when it -when it inquired into the effectiveness of the -- of the
search in service of the stated goal.

And what the

Court said is it does -- it is not necessarily a matter
of common sense that we will catch more people if we
just set out to do it without any suspicion.

Isn't it

far more sensible, in fact, to look for the
14
ALDERSOIM REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

manifestations, to -- to -- to see what kinds of

2

problems you have bearing in mind that none has

3

emerged?

4

some kind of significant problem before that -- that has

5

never surfaced.

6
7

8

11
12
13

here c.ny kind of work place infractions -- and use those
as the basis for individualized suspicion.
In that event, I suggest -- and the record I
-- I think there is not a suggestion in this record to
the contrary -- that that would be a far more effective
way to search out whether, in fact, there is anyone in
this work force to be concerned about.
There is -- the deterrence rationale seems to

14
15
16
17

20
21

22

25

But look for those kinds of infractions

-- in Delaware v. Prouse, it was traffic infractions;

9
10

It's inconceivable that there should have been

me to go to the heart of what the Fourth Amendment is
all about.

And if deterrence alone is enough to justify

dragnet searching of innocent people, I do not see any
principled way that lines can begin to be drawn after
that.
Now, perhaps if we are talking about dramatic
public safety concerns, that is a place where we would
want to draw a line.

But the further we get from that

into areas of integrity and responsibility -QUESTION:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES FRIED

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FRIED:

3
4

Thank you, Mr Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

5

The Fourth Amendment says that the right of

6

the people to be secure against unreasonable searches

7

and seizures shall not be violated.
Our principal contention here is that what the

8
9

Customs Service has done is entirely reasonable.

Let me

10

focus in a little bit more on the -- on the program we

11

have, and I think it's very well described in

12

Petitioners' amici, the AF of L-CIO.
On page 4 of their brief, the AF of L-CIO

13
14

writes, this program "applies only to a self-selected

15

subgroup of employees:

16

a promotion to a new job for which some inquiry into the

17

employees' fitness for duty must be conducted."

18
19

20
21

those who voluntarily apply for

then a footnote goes on to say:

And

"Indeed, of these

applicants, only those who are tentatively selected for
promotion are required to undergo the test, and before
being so required these individuals are permitted to

22

withdraw."

23

this has no employment consequences and they are free to

24
25

I would only add that if they do withdraw,

reapply at any time.
It seems to us that this program so described
27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

is a very long way from what the Fourth Amendment was

2

originally intended to cover.

3

nevertheless -- over the years and through many

4

decisions of this Court, it's quite clear that

5

government programs that implicate privacy and dignitary

6

interests of the individual come within the

7

gravitational force of the Fourth Amendment.

8

don't dispute that.

9

Nevertheless --

And we

What's also clear, however, is that the

10

further you come from the central case of an abrupt,

11

coercive intrusion upon the individual in a criminal

12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23

context, the less appropriate it is to think in terms of
probable cause and the warrant and the more we're thrown
back on the overarching test of reasonableness which the
amendment itself specifically sets forward.
Now, that reasonableness is the product of a
balance, a balance of the seriousness of the
government's interest, on one hand, and the intrusion on
the individual, its nature, its context, its timing.
QUESTION:
this question?

Mr. Solicitor General, may I ask

Is one element in the balance the

probability that some useful information will be
discovered?

When we talk in -- in the normal warrant

24

case probable cause to find something or -- is that an

25

element in the balance?
28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

MR. FRIED:

1

It is an element in the balance,

2

and I think that's an important point to talk about

3

because it's hard to argue -- and nobody seriously

4

argues -- that the government does not have a very

5

serious interest in assuring that those who are on the

6
7

8
9

front line of drug interception are not themselves
involved in drugs.

And that does not mean just on the

job, but the weekend before or the week before or the
month before. That's quite clear.
What is urged against this program and what is

10
11

said to argue against its reasonableness is that this is

12

not as effective as it might be in weeding out drug

13

users.

14

We are told that it's possible to defeat the test.

15

you have to do is abstain from drugs for a period of

16

from five days to -- we heard Mr. Mann say in. the

25

All

Now it seems to us that the very

18
19

But that seems to us a rather curious objection.

indefiniteness of that time horizon is going to have an
effect.

It will deter persons from applying for the job

because they can't be sure if they have been involved in
a drug, that they're going to be drug-free.
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, may I

interrupt because I don't think we should talk about
applicants.

We're talking about a group of people who
29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

And as your brief points out, they

2

have a 50 to 67 percent capacity under drugs and they

have absenteeism and all the rest of it.

have it -- they have a track record of not disclosing

5

that kind of behavior.

And they don't

It's a very

But, again, let me just -- let me

just -- so you have time to address it.

If in the

12

produce incriminating evidence and you have a test of

13

two people out of a couple of thousand or whatever it

is, is that a sufficient probability you think to be
reasonable?
MR. FRIED:

22

with respect, apples and oranges because the point of
probable cause is to focus and -- to focus and to
confine discretion.

25

In this case there is no need to

confine discretion because the program specifies the
threshold and persons voluntarily approach that
threshold.

It is an important part of our argument not
only that the government's need is an important one, but
that intrusion is minimal.

intrusiveness of a search that would reveal financial
information.

Yes, it is.

This is a very

23

the intrusiveness of this search is much less than the

circumstances than we have here.

10
11

But of their persons.

Which I might point out is the

exact opposite of the position Justice Scalia suggested
earlier .
MR. FRIED:

Justice Scalia, I think, was

saying that the financial search which he and I and you

This is much less intrusive, and

That -- that is,

Are you saying, General Fried, that

one of the principal interests the government has here
is to vindicate the idea and the image of an elite corps
within the government?
MR. FRIED:

10
11

This is

Well, yes, I think one can put

that in a way which makes it seem rather showboating and
insubstantial or something which is very, very sensible.
I think there's a sensible aspect here and that is these

16

customers of the very illicit trade which they are the

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

And they should, therefore, not be the

front line of interdicting.

And this is a way of

indicating that any involvement, not just the day
before, but perhaps up to 60 days, is incompatible, and
it's really one of the most secure ways of showing that
there is no such involvement.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Fried, I guess this

program though extends to employees other than those on
the front lines of drug interdiction, for example, in
the classified information area.

Apparently it extends

even to messengers and food service workers.
MR. FRIED:

The three categories which the

program designates are persons actually involved in drug

4

interception, persons who carry or use firearms and

5

persons who have access to classified information.

6
7

8
9

Now, it may be that certain individuals have
been included under those major categories improperly or
who shouldn't have been.

And then we could have a

discussion about that, and that would be a basis for a

10

complaint if somebody said that, look, I -- I carry

11

sealed envelopes and I shouldn't be included.

QUESTION:

Is this purely a facial challenge

so that we leave room for those degrees of difference -MR. FRIED:

The challenge has not been

litigated at all on the basis that it's a little bit
over-inclusive here and might have been a little bit
more -- more inclusive there.

So, it is in the nature

of a facial challenge.
As we consider the intrusion -- and this is
the point that Justice Stevens was concerned about -- it
is minimally intrusive for a number of reasons.

the very fact of self-selection makes an important point
about how unintrusive it is.

privacy in our society, and that's -- we don't quarrel
with that.

We don't try to belittle it.
In fact, the HHS regulations under which this

3
4

and all employee drug -- federal employee drug testing

5

must take place was developed as a result of a

6

rulemaking procedure in which these very concerns, these

and there was an adjustment.

Judge Gezell noted in a

controllers that this program was designed to somehow

11

At first it was thought that the collection

would take place under direct observation, and as a

14

result of hearing exactly the kind of objections which

15
16

18
19

stepped back.

said, no, there will not be direct observation unless
there's some reason to believe that something unusual is
going on.
Now, it seems to me that that very stepping

21

24
25

It averted its eyes, as it were, and

back is exactly the kind of acknowledgement that there
is a privacy concern which should go a long way to
assuage the sense that something unpleasant is going
on.

There -- you go into a stall, and that -- it's an

area which is designated to be private.

Now, it's not

and off-duty behavior of the employees.

There's a drug testing program which is

5

that nothing will be said to preclude them either.

6
7

But we ask neither that we get a hint

That

really lies in the future.
No doubt both the Customs Service and the

8

Department of Transportation are contemplating much more

9

extensive programs.

And those programs will have to

10

await the day of review in the Department of Justice and

11

review in the lower courts.

12

I would hope that the Court will consider this

case with this case's justification and its rather

because we are here dealing with the borders across

QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, this -- this

program is limited to urine testing, isn't it?
MR. FRIED:
QUESTION:

Yes, it is.
Was there any consideration of

blood testing and any reason for not including it?
MR. FRIED:

There was no consideration of

blood testing, and one reason is that the urine test is
really pretty good in showing not current impairment
because current impairment is not our focus.

Our focus

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

What did you mean by that?
MR. FRIED:

2

What I meant by that is that the

Customs Service is, indeed, entitled to take a very fine

4

filter, which this is, to show to itself, to its

5

employees and to the public that persons who will be in

-- who will be on the border across which these drugs
come are persons who, as far as we can tell, are not
themselves involved in drugs.

nonintrusive, rather familiar kind of step that's taken

That symbolic assurance would be

precisely the same for searches for financial
information too.

It is a balance. It's not very intrusive,

QUESTION:

level employees must give that financial information and

important element in the balance.

21

23

25

course, the employer is entitled to inquire about all
sorts of things when one applies for this kind of job.
The question is saying that I have an interest in
whether or not you ever used drugs -- does that give me
the right to conduct searches to find out whether you
are telling me the truth?

And one of the most

unsettling arguments the government makes is we can take
no risk.

We can take no risk at all.
