ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case arises under the vaccine injury act

12

and involves an interpretation of two related provisions.

13

The first creates a presumption that a vaccine has caused

14

a child's condition when the first symptom or

15

manifestation of the onset of that condition occurs within

16

a specified period after the administration of a vaccine.

17

The second permits the Secretary to rebut the presumption

18

of causation by showing that the child's condition is due

19

to factors unrelated to the vaccine.

20

Our position is that the court of appeals erred

21

in its interpretation of each of these provisions.

22

start with the statutory presumption in section 300aa-ll,

23

which appears in page 2 of our brief.

24
25

Let me

The court of appeals interpreted the requirement
that the first symptom or manifestation of onset must

1

occur in the statutory period to mean that a presumption

2

of causation will arise whenever any manifestation of a

3

covered condition occurs after the administration of the

4

vaccine, even if that condition has already manifested

5

itself beforehand.

6

So under the court of appeals decision, if a

7

child has very clear manifestations of a serious brain

8

injury, and then has the vaccine, and then another

9

manifestation of the same condition, under the court of

10

appeals decision, there will be a presumption that the

11

vaccine caused the onset of the child's condition, and we

12

think that interpretation is incorrect for two reasons.

13

First, it is inconsistent with the use of the

14

statutory terms, first, and onset.

15

already manifested itself prior to the administration of a

16

vaccine, any manifestation of that same condition that

17

occurs after the administration of the vaccine cannot be

18

first, and it cannot be a manifestation of onset.

19

very first symptom or manifestation of onset necessarily

20

implied the absence of any preexisting symptom or

21

manifestation of that same condition.

22

When a condition has

The

The second reason that we think the court of

23

appeals erred in its interpretation is that its

24

interpretation fails to take into account the fact that

25

Congress specifically addressed cases where conditions had

1

already manifested themselves prior to the administration

2

of a vaccine through the significant aggravation

3

presumption.
Under section 300aa-ll, there is a separate

4
5

presumption of causation when the first symptom or

6

manifestation of a significant aggravation of a

7

preexisting condition occurs within the statutory period.

8

We think the clear import of that separate presumption is

9

that when a condition has already manifested itself prior

10

to the administration of the vaccine, a presumption that

11

the vaccine has something to do with the child's condition

12

can only arise when that preexisting condition has gotten

13

worse after the administration of the vaccine.

14

So under a simple and straightforward reading of

15

the statutory language, the simple existence of a symptom

16

or manifestation of a covered condition in the statutory

17

period is never enough by itself to trigger the

18

presumption that the vaccine has caused the child's

19

condition.

20

there's no preexisting symptom or manifestation of that

21

condition, or the child's condition has gotten markedly

22

worse afterwards.

23

In addition, it must either be the case that

By holding the court of appeals holding that the

24

existence of a symptom or manifestation of a condition in

25

the statutory period was sufficient by itself to trigger

1

the statutory presumption, we think the court of appeals

2

clearly erred.
QUESTION:

3

Mr. Gornstein, if we had only the

4

language that was in that table and not the statutory

5

language, wouldn't there be more of a case for the

6

opposite interpretation?

7

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Justice Ginsburg, I think even

8

if we were just looking at that table language, and that

9

appears, by the way, at page 4 of our brief, and says,

10

"Time period for first symptom or manifestation of onset

11

or of significant aggravation after vaccine

12

administration," there would be more of a case, but I

13

still think you would come to the same conclusion, because

14

the words "first" are still used in relation to the term

15

"onset" and I think when a condition has manifested itself

16

prior to vaccine administration, anything that comes after

17

that cannot be the first manifestation of onset.

18

Even trying to give some meaning to the word

19

"first" in the table period is difficult, given the way

20

the court of appeals interpreted that phrase, because if

21

Congress had set out to do what the court of appeals had

22

done, it wouldn't have needed to use the word "first" at

23

all.

24

administration, because any symptom is always first in

25

relation to what came -- comes after the statutory period.

It could have just said, any symptom after vaccine

(800) FOR DEPO

1

The only real reason to use the word "first" is

2

to make clear that you're talking about first in relation

3

to what came before the statutory period.
But whatever ambiguity you have when you just

4
5

look at this language, I think the bigger problem with

6

what the court of appeals did is that it looked here at

7

all, because the purpose of the Vaccine Injury Table is

8

not to set out what the claimant is required to show in

9

order to trigger the statutory presumption.

It's set out

10

to show the time period in which the claimant has to make

11

that showing.
QUESTION:

12

Isn't the term "first" somewhat

13

superfluous with the term "onset"?

14

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Well, I think you have the first

15

symptom or manifestation of onset, or significant

16

aggravation.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

So first doesn't modify onset, in

your view?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

I think it -- it does modify

20

onset, yes, but I think it's just first symptom or

21

manifest -- it's somewhat superfluous, I would agree, but

22

I think it makes it more clear.

23

relationship between "first" and "onset."

It describes a

24

So I think that that is the basic mistake, is in

25

looking to the Vaccine Injury Table, because what -- under

1

section 300aa-13, it tells you that compensation is

2

appropriate when the petitioner has demonstrated the

3

matters in 300aa-ll, and 300aa-ll is the part of the

4

statute we're relying on, which is very clear, and I

5

believe even the court of appeals acknowledged that when

6

you look at 300aa-ll, it's very clear that the claimant

7

has to show, in effect, the first of all manifestations.

8

QUESTION:

Mr. Gornstein, if we were to agree

with you on the interpretation of the statute as to
10

question 1 in the cert petition, do we need to reach the

11

question of the standards under question 2, as posed in

12

the cert position?

13

MR. GORNSTEIN:

You do not.

We have presented

14

both questions because we think that in this case one or

15

the other has to be suffic -- there are two independent

16

grounds, and either one will do.

17

QUESTION:

The respondent spends a good deal of

18

time discussing how the district court might have reached

1

the wrong conclusion on the facts here.

20

those matters are open on remand.

MR. GORNSTEIN:

We would agree that those

matters are open on remand.

1

symptom?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

2

The first symptom or

3

manifestation was the abnormally small head size at birth,

4

which was -- the special master found was a positive

5

indication that this child was -- already had a very

6

serious brain injury.

7

The second clear manifestation occurred at

8

between 3 and 4 months, and that was the fact that she

9

fell further behind on the growth chart in head size, and

10

so that was also, the special master said, a manifestation

11

that she had a preexisting brain injury, serious brain

12

injury.

13

QUESTION:

Is there any question in the record,

14

just as an evidentiary matter, that the head size can be

15

treated as a cause of the brain injury?

16

MR. GORNSTEIN:

I would say it's not the head

17

size that's the cause, it is the abnormally small brain

18

that is the cause of the injury, and it is the abnormally

19

small head size that tells you you have an abnormally

20

small brain, and sometimes the term microcephaly is used

21

to refer to both of those things, but what you have is an

22

abnormally small head size that tells you you have an

23

abnormally small brain, and that's what the special master

24

found.

So there's no question about the

evidentiary basis for that relationship.

MR. GORNSTEIN:

3

QUESTION:

4

No.

If we therefore reverse, there's not

going to be a fight over what the evidence shows.
MR. GORNSTEIN:

5

Well, the other side may have a

6

different view on whether the kind of - - the head size

7

here was sufficiently indicative of an abnormally small

8

brain, the kind of abnormally small brain that would

9

result in the conditions, and that was the dispute that

10

was had at trial.
The special master resolved that by finding that

11
12

there was sufficient evidence that it was so abnormally

13

small as to indicate abnormally small brain that would

14

give rise to these conditions.

15

QUESTION:

You say there's no question about the

16

evidentiary basis for that finding.

17

MR. GORNSTEIN:

I think that's clearly

18

supportable in the evidence.

19

disturb the special master's findings on that, and in

20

answer to Justice O'Connor's question, I was simply saying

21

that that is open on remand for them to argue that there's

something wrong with that finding.

4

Is that what the

I think that's the factual

dispute, that the head -- they would agree, I believe,

6

that at some point the head size is so small as to let you

7

know that there is a real problem and that brain injury

8

has already occurred, but they'll have to speak for

9

themselves on that issue, but I think what they would say

10

is, it wasn't small enough, and that the special master

11

heard conflicting evidence about that and concluded that

12

it was.

13

He also concluded -- really, the main dispute

14

was at birth, but there was really no -- what was even

15

clearer evidence is the further fall-off below the second

Well, let me ask you, and perhaps

this will bring you to your second point, was it the

that the ultimate condition, the encephalopathy, was

25

related to the microcephaly?

MR. GORNSTEIN:

1

Yes, that's right, that the

2

abnormally small brain led to the difficulties that this

3

child later experienced in life, including mental

4

retardation, and cerebral palsy, that these are, in fact,

5

children with microcephaly, over 90 percent turn out to

QUESTION:

There's only a small

And is that the reason --or perhaps

there are other reasons.

Is that the reason that the

ultimate condition is not idiopathic?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

11

The reason that the ultimate

12

condition is nonidiopathic is that we take a different

13

view of what that term means than did the court of

14

appeals.

15

the Secretary saying something like, we know, we have

16

evidence that the vaccine did not cause the child's

17

condition, but we have no idea what did.

18

We think that what not idiopathic rules out is

The court of appeals took that one step further

19

back and said, even if we can identify a factor that

20

caused the child's condition, we then have to go back and

21

show what caused that factor, effectively requiring a dual

22

layer of causation.

23

So it wasn't enough for the Government to show

24

that the small brain, abnormally small brain led to the

25

child's condition unless the Government can then go back

and show what caused the child to have a small, abnormally

2

small brain size in the first place.
QUESTION:

3

So are you saying that you can

4

concede that the microcephaly is idiopathic, in the sense

5

that we don't know what caused it, but that you still

6

prevail in this case?

7

MR. GORNSTEIN:

That's right, because I think

8

idiopathic within the meaning of this statute simply -- it

12

That's not this case.

I have no idea

The Secretary is saying,

we know what caused the child's condition.

just don't know what caused that.

QUESTION:

It is the
We

So idiopathic depends on the question

17

we're asking, I take it.

18

MR. GORNSTEIN:

That's exactly right, and I

19

think that to resolve that ambiguity I think you should go

20

back to the core language in section 300aa-13, which says

21

that the Secretary --

22

can rebut the presumption of causation by showing that the

23

child's condition is due to factors unrelated to the

24

administration of that vaccine.

25

(b), that shows that the Secretary

1

get the sense that the Secretary can rebut the presumption

2

of causation by showing an alternative cause, but nothing

3

in that would require the Secretary to establish the cause

4

of the cause, and I think when you move down to the later

5

references to idiopathic, you should -- and unknown, you

6

should read them in light of that basic distinction.

7

What must be known is the cause, not the cause

8

of the cause, and the purpose of this idiopathic provision

9

was to clear up an ambiguity that would otherwise have

10

existed if they had just said, factors unrelated to the

11

administration of the vaccine, because at that point it

might have been the case that the Secretary could have

Does the medical profession use the

word, idiopathic, in the same sense that we're using it

here, relative depending on which question we're asking?

MR. GORNSTEIN:

I think that's right.

I can't

20

say that's 100 percent true, but I think they would

describe -- they could easily describe it either way,

22

depending on the question you're trying to answer.

enough to cover this situation:

when that condition is part of a recognized disease, in

and of itself, although we don't know what causes the

disease?
For example, if you had a vaccine, one of the

symptoms of which is people get -- sometimes get forgetful

after a couple of days, and someone with Alzheimer's

disease had the vaccine and was indeed forgetful.

wouldn't say, in effect, I suppose, that Alzheimer's

disease causes forgetfulness.

We

That's what we mean by

10

Alzheimer's disease, so in that case, if the Secretary

11

came in with evidence there was preexisting Alzheimer's

disease, would that be sufficient for rebuttal under your

understanding of idiopathic?

2

in the sense that we don't know what caused the cancer,

it's not idiopathic within the meaning of the statute,

because it is a specific factor that the Secretary is

The

support of our interpretation, other than the statutory

language that I relied on, is that the court of appeals'

interpretation is really inconsistent with the purposes of

the compensation program, because by adding a second layer

13

of causation, they are really requiring compensation in

cases in which everyone would agree that the vaccine could

not have caused the child's condition because something

else did.

that the first symptom or manifestation of the injury or

11

the aggravation occurred within 3 days after the DPT

13

MR. MOXLEY:

14

QUESTION:

I agree, Your Honor.
And yet the Fed Circuit seemed not to

15

do that simple thing.

16

even if it were just the case I was describing, that that

17

words wouldn't apply.

18

Rather, they seemed to say that

That's what I thought the issue was initially,

19

and then that seems to be mixed up with a different issue,

20

is, is this small head size like the prevaccine seizures

21

or not like the prevaccine seizures?

22

it wasn't a symptom or manifestation, and I guess

23

initially the other side said it was.

The Office of

Special Masters has articulated a presumption of normalcy
for the child at the time of the shot if the child has had

no overt symptoms of encephalopathy, and if you'll look at

11

the Government's reply brief, they would put the burden on

12

us of proving that the child was normal at the time of the

shot, and we believe that we need an articulation of what

this statute means in terms of what it means to our

this child has the right to be presumed to be normal if

she had no symptoms of encephalopathy that fit the

And that's what the table -- that's

the theory of the table under his view of the statute.
MR. GORNSTEIN:

His theory was that the seizure

12

was the manifestation of a significant aggravation, and

13

the special master addressed that and said that it wasn't

14

because the seizures were very brief and transient, that

15

after the seizures in the table period, that the child

returned to her prevaccine neurological status, that she

continued to progress at the basically kind of slow but

7

QUESTION:

8

QUESTION:

But Mr. Gornstein I think has raised

9

a point which he'd like guidance on in this, because

10

suppose that this child has the seizure within 3 days

11

after the DPT vaccine is administered, and suppose that

12

really is the first seizure, and the purpose of this

13

statute is so you don't have to go into a long thing about

14

causation, you don't have to go into a long thing about

15

whether there was some other, mysterious thing that caused

16

it.

17

Well, you could, on your interpretation, have to

18

go into that long thing, because if mysterious disease X

19

that nobody knows about in fact had caused something,

20

arguably, prior to the administration of the vaccine, like

21

a head-twisting, or something, then it would be open to

22

the Government to say, oh, you see, that was really the

23

first symptom, in which case by the back door you'd bring

24

in all these other mysterious, idiopathic or whatever,

causes.

before the vaccine was administered.

MR. GORNSTEIN:

You see,

You could, but I'm not sure I

see what the problem with that is, when the statute, the
10

terms of the statute say that the claimant has to show

11

that the first symptom or manifestation of encephalopathy

12

occurred after a vaccine administration.

13

And if there is a preexisting manifestation of

encephalopathy, and there is medical evidence to that

effect, it's just that we don't know what caused the
