ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM W. ALLEN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. ALLEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
The petitioners contend that section 27A(b) of

12

the Securities Exchange Act, 1934, was a valid exercise of

13

the legislative power, and that the decision of the Sixth

14

Circuit Court of Appeals invalidating that statute

15

primarily on separation of powers grounds was erroneous

16

and should be reversed.

17

This Court has recognized since its decision in

18

The United States v. The Schooner Peggy that final

19

judgments may be subject to congressional influence even

20

in the case of a final and appealable judgment as long as

21

the case is pending.

22

QUESTION:

I think this -You say -- you say a final judgment.

23

You mean a final judgment in, say, a trial court, or do

24

you mean a final judgment that has run through the appeal

25

process and has become final against direct review?

MR. ALLEN:

1

Your Honor, I am referring to a

2

final judgment in a case that is still within the

3

appellate process.

4

judgment in a pending case and a final judgment that has

5

become -- has become final through the expiration of the

6

parties' right to further appellate review, and I refer to

7

that as a final case, and I think those distinctions are

8

important to an understanding of the argument that the

9

petitioners make.
QUESTION:

10

I'm distinguishing between a final

Which are you calling which?

The one

11

where there's no further review possible you're going to

12

call what?

3
4

MR. ALLEN:

I'm saying that a case becomes final

at that point.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. ALLEN:

Okay.
Up until that point, the case is

7

pending, although a final judgment may have been entered

8

in that case, final in the sense that the court has issued

9

its result in the particular dispute.

20

It has pronounced what the result of the

21

adjudication is, but the case is still somewhere within

22

the appellate process and is therefore still pending, and

23

it's -- as I was saying, under The United States v. The

24

Schooner Peggy, if a final judgment is entered in a case

25

that still is pending within the process, the appellate

power changes the law at that point, under The Schooner

3

Peggy and its progeny,

affirming its earlier final judgment that was rightfully

MR. ALLEN:

Well, I think that that's correct,

11

Your Honor.

12

calls for, 1 think, is to specifically identify the

13

institutional interest of the court that requires

14

separation of powers protection and requires the adoption

15

of the absolute rule that was adopted by the Sixth

16

Circuit, and that final judgments in final cases are

17

absolutely sacrosanct and are forever beyond the reach of

18

Congress, at least in private actions involving the

19

adjudication of private statutory rights.

20

The issue that -- or the -- what this case

QUESTION:

Has this Court ever upheld a

21

legislative invalidation of final judgments of an

22

Article III court?

MR. ALLEN:

I think that it has.

The closest

24

statute, or the closest analogy here, Your Honor, I

25

believe is the statute in The United States v. Sioux

Nation of Indians.
QUESTION:

2

Well, but in Sioux Nation it involved

3

the Government and the opinion of this Court at least said

4

Congress did not interfere with the finality of the court

5

of claims judgments and went on to justify it on the

6

theory that a new action had been created, so how does

7

that support your position?
MR. ALLEN:

8

9

Well, actually, I think -- I agree

that the holding in United States v. Sioux Nation does not

10

directly address the question that's presented in this

11

case.

12

In fact, I think for separation of powers

13

purposes Sioux Nation was actually a more difficult case

14

than is presented by section 27A(b), because 27A(b)

15

clearly changed the law.

16

the law and provided a mechanism by which this case and

17

the defined group of cases could be reinstated for further

18

adjudication by the courts of the new statutory rights.

19

QUESTION:

It made a substantive change in

In another sense, Sioux Nation was an

20

easier case, since the party defendant was the Government,

21

the party who had the benefit of the prior judgment, and I

22

think the Court opinion suggested that the Government as a

23

litigant could waive rights but it might not be able to

24

impose the same sort of waivers on other parties who are

25

not the Government.

MR. ALLEN:

1

Your Honor, I understand and agree

2

that that language is in the opinion.

3

that that really addresses more squarely the due process

4

argument in this case rather than the separation of powers

5

issue, which I believe is really specifically why Congress

6

should be prohibited from enacting a statute which

7

authorizes the restoration of a case to pending status for

8

further adjudication of rights that are created in that

9

statute.

10

QUESTION:

However, I believe

Well, that's certainly not what Sioux

11

Nation said.

12

holding does refer to separation of powers.

13

Congress' -- this is a quote -- "mere waiver of the res

14

judicata effect of a prior judicial decision rejecting the

15

validity of a legal claim against the United States does

16

not violate the doctrine of separation of powers."

17

I mean, the case's own description of its
It says that

So we were using simply a waiver of res judicata

18

by the Government as a vindication of the separation of

19

powers validity of the case.

20

that's wrong, but that's at least what we said.

21

QUESTION:

Now, you may persuade us

Well, Your Honor, I agree that that's

22

what the Court said, but I do believe that this is a

23

different case than Sioux Nation.

24
25

It is different because, again, the Court, or
the Congress changed the law and created new rights, and I

1

think the difference, or the constitutionality of the

2

statute is illustrated by postulating a statute that very

3

well may violate and be unconstitutional under separation

4

of powers principles as well as due process principles,

5

and that would be a statute involving private statutory

6

rights that calls for the following:

7

The judgment in favor of the plaintiffs in Civil

8

Action Number 1234 is hereby set aside and remanded for

9

further trial or for retrial on the same facts and on the

10

same law, with the further congressional admonition that

11

you will continue to retry this case on the same facts and

12

the same law until you obtain the result that Congress

13

wants, to wit, judgment for the defendants.

14

Now, that is a statute that -- involving private

15

rights that I think would clearly be a judicial act, no

16

change in the law, simply setting aside a judgment with an

17

instruction to retry the case and attempt to come up with

18

another result.

19

I --

QUESTION:

Suppose Congress changed the statute

20

of limitations and then added a second clause which said,

21

res judicata shall not apply in any 10b-5 case that has

22

been commenced after a certain date, and sets that date

23

5 years back, so that all cases can be reopened if they've

24

been filed within 5 years.

difficult problem than is presented by this case.

2

think, again, referring to the institutional interests of

3

the Court that are protected by the separation of powers

4

doctrine, the Court has an interest in preventing

5

impairment of the judicial power and the exercise of the

6

judicial power, and I think there may be limits under the

7

separation of powers doctrine for legislation which just

8

wholesale reopens masses of cases that might overwhelm the

9

judicial system.

QUESTION:

Well, isn't the whole story that the

16

judgments of this Court and of the Article III courts

17

ought to be rendered without fear of their being corrected

18

in a supervisorial way by the political branches?

19

MR. ALLEN:

Well, Your Honor, that gets, again,

20

back to the identification of the institutional interest

21

that's being served by the rule that you're suggesting,

22

which is that judgments are inviolate and that the rights

23

that are fixed in those judgments are forever beyond the

24

reach of Congress.

but ultimately they can send it back and say, do it again.
MR. ALLEN:

Well, Your Honor, I don't believe

16

they can just send it back without more.

17

they can change the law and the fact that the parties

18

whose rights are affected, or the -- involved in a prior

19

adjudication and a final judgment that became final, is

20

not the bright line between the constitutionality of the

21

legislative act, or does not define the constitutionality

22

of the legislative act.

23

The Congress makes the law.

We contend that

It's the duty of

the court to apply the laws, and to apply the laws as they

are at the time the court acts.

The court has an institutional interest in the

1

2

integrity of the judicial process, and I don't think that

3

Congress should be able to come along and run through and

4

interfere with the process of finding facts, determining

5

and applying the law, and coming to a result, but Congress

6

can, in its discharge of its political and policymaking

7

functions, change, enhance, withdraw, contract the private

rights of parties, and I don't think that the --

QUESTION:

It can create whole new rights,

couldn't it?

11

MR. ALLEN:

12

QUESTION:

Indeed, Your Honor, yes.
So long as the Due Process Clause

13

didn't prevent it, it could retroactively create a new

14

right.

15

process problems if you did that, but short of those due

16

process -- it can do that, but it didn't do that here.

17

wants the Court to repronounce the prior right which it

18

said no longer existed.

19

ultimately, this right does not exist.

20

Now, I think you would come up with some due

MR. ALLEN:

It

The Court said, finally and

Your Honor, I -- I think that

21

that -- I understand the point that you're making.

I

22

don't agree, though, that the fact that the judgment has

become final is the bright line here, and that it limits

24

at that point forever more the power of Congress to affect

25

those private rights.

Another example that might shed some light on

1

2

this would be a statute which restores the aiding -- or,

3

creates a cause of action for aiding and abetting a

4

violation of section 10(b) and makes that retroactive and

5

establishes a limitations period for 10 years.

6

Let's postulate that some individuals might have

7

been sued for aiding and abetting a violation in the past,

8

prior to the enactment of the statute, and the court held

9

that no such cause of action existed, and that judgment

10

became final.

11

would have been correct when rendered, but is that group

12

of people forever immunized from the reach of Congress

13

simply because they happened to be party to an

14

adjudication that adjudged that no such cause of action

15

existed.

16

There's no question that that judgment

point, that upholding the statute in this case is not

1

What would those limitations be as to

the separation of powers?

action just deals with a few cases?

MR. ALLEN:

No.

So long as the congressional

I think that, again, I'm not

sure where the outer limits of this would be, and I don't

6

think it's necessary to define the outer limits of it

7

under the Separation of Powers Clause.

8

that the limits might come in the due process rationality

test.
QUESTION:

10

Actually, I think

So you say, in effect, very likely

11

the Separation of Powers Clause doesn't provide any

12

limits.

13

MR. ALLEN:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. ALLEN:

Well, I think it does.
Then what are they?
Well, the limits are that the

16

separation of powers doctrine prohibits the direct

17

exercise of the judicial power.

18

power, the essence of it is the process of finding facts,

19

of determining and applying the law, and reaching a

20

result, and I think that if Congress unduly interferes

21

with that, and again, the statute that I postulated as an

22

example, it simply sets aside a judgment that that kind of

23

legislation is the kind of legislation that the separation

24

of powers doctrine was intended to prohibit.

something else that makes us different.

was the fact that we could render final decisions, but you

may it please the Court:
The court of appeals holding in this case rests

2

3

on the view that there is an indispensable attribute of

4

finality in judicial decisions that is completely immune

5

from any congressional action, and accordingly, the court

6

found this statute invalid under the separation of powers

doctrine.

8

Our position is that there is a sense in which

9

judicial decisions do have an attribute of finality, but

10

it is not in the sense that the court of appeals found it

in this case.

12

decision is fairly accurately captured by the opinions

that were rendered in Hayburn's Case, namely, a decision

Mr. Dreeben, let's assume that

call them the blind-sided plaintiffs who suffered in the

aftermath of Lampf, that with respect to them there was --

as it were, by definition this was intended to have

retrospective effect.

Those plaintiffs could then -- if Congress had

courts would have been that these people were blind-sided

3

by what we have to accept was simply a lightening bolt of

legal change, and that therefore they have a strong reason

5

for equity on their side, assuming there is no due process

QUESTION:

All right.

Do we have the option,

3

then, in this case, to say that just as we try to avoid

4

the resolution generally of constitutional issues that we

don't have to reach, that what should have occurred in the

6

lower courts was the consideration of applying Rule 60(b)

7

in combination with the new statute of limitations and not

8

even reaching the issue of whether Congress itself can

MR. DREEBEN:

I am not sure whether in this

question it probably wasn't made here, but shouldn't a

effect, I'm not going to reach the constitutional issue

17

unless you somehow tell me that I've got to reach it

18

because we can't get to the same point by applying the

19

statute, by applying the statute of limitations under Rule

20

60(b), and shouldn't the Court have done that?

21

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, the reason why some courts

22

may not have done that is, there is a line of 60(b) law

23

that changes in statutory law does not justify reopening

24

of an otherwise final judgment, and it may be in the view

that that was the requirement under 60(b) that those

MR. DREEBEN:

6

No, I don't think that it is a

7

rule suggested by the separation of powers, Justice

8

Scalia, because what is going on in these cases is that

9

Congress has acted legislatively to change a governing

10

rule that was conceded by everyone when this Court -- when

11

Lampf was before this Court, namely, what should the

12

statute of limitations be for a statutory cause of action?

QUESTION:

But under your answer to Justice

Souter, you indicated that it would be in that

itself, a mandate to reopen.

QUESTION:

The -If we assume that there's no due

process problem in the enactment of the new statute of

limitations, then basically, doesn't the question of abuse

6

of discretion turn on a kind of traditional notion of

7

equity?

8

In other words, should those who are blind­
sided be given a second chance, and if that is in fact the

10

criterion, is it fair to say that it's the mandate of

11

Congress, rather than the application of a kind of garden

12

variety criterion for reopening judgments, which is

13

operative here?

14
15
16

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't think it's quite as garden

variety as all that, Justice Souter.
The cases that have addressed whether final

17

judgments should be reopened because of changes in

18

statutory law do not clearly indicate the courts must

1

reopen final judgments that were otherwise not appealed,

20

and I believe that it is for that reason that Congress

21

prescribed a rule of law in section 27A, subsection (b),

22

that in effect amends Rule 60(b) for this particular

23

purpose and requires courts to reopen otherwise final

24

cases for the application of new substantive law.

is nothing in that legislative action that is improper.

MR. DREEBEN:

12

That is generally the way that

13

this Court operates when it interprets a statute.

14

may qualify as a rare exception to that, because the Court

15

very freely conceded that there was no underlying

16

statutory right that Congress had ever created or that it

17

was ever aware of, and that in fashioning a statute of

All right.

So I've a human question,

rather than an institutional one.

3

I'd always thought that the human purpose

4

underlying separation of powers was to prevent what I'd

5

call a vendetta, where one group of people decide to pass

6

a law, then apply it, then adjudicate it as well.

7

Now, why isn't this one of the strongest cases

8

of vendetta one can imagine, an unpopular, small group of

9

people who, in fact, are affected by a law that applies to

10

no one else, that does not apply to the future and

11

therefore doesn't affect general policy, and is

12

retroactive, and reopens a closed judgment by a court?

13

there's a stronger example of a vendetta, I'd like to know

14

it.

If

I mean, that's what I'm concerned about in terms

of the policy underlying separation of powers, and I guess

they are, why isn't that also a violation of the Due

such as in Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Society that was

2

enacted with the specific purpose in mind of affecting a

3

particular pending case, so I don't think that by itself,

4

retroactivity constitutes a separation of powers problem.

5

What Congress was doing here was something quite

6

similar to what the Court itself had done under the rule

7

of Chevron Oil v. Huson, namely, taking into account that

8

people rely on what the statute of limitations is when

9

they choose to bring a lawsuit.

10

Plaintiffs in these cases relied on the statute

11

of limitations in their respective jurisdictions, and this

12

case, for example, was filed before any Federal court had

13

ever applied a Federal statute of limitations to a Rule

14

10b-5 case, borrowing it from another section of the

15

securities laws.

16

When this Court decided Lampf, many people who

17

justifiably relied on the existing state of the law were

18

surprised, or Congress could have so found, and this

19

Court, while it could have taken action to protect

20

similarly situated plaintiffs under Chevron Oil v. Huson,

21

and it had indeed taken such action in other statute of

22

limitations cases where the statute was, in effect,

23

retroactively made shorter, had declared in Beam that it

24

would not take action to affect these particular cases.

It does seem to me we have to assume,

Justice Ginsburg, that when the Congress of the United

greater where the cases have not been brought or the cases

have not been litigated.

17

If the cases are already in the litigation

process, and decisions have been made by Article III

I don't think -- I hadn't thought of

I don't think that there would be a

refer to the Federated Department Stores case and the fact

that as far as I could tell in my research for this

QUESTION:

10

It seems to me you're on the horns of

a dilemma.

If you must reopen under 60(b) you violate the

I can't imagine it wouldn't violate due process.

procedures, decide the rights of individuals and

It's another thing entirely under the Due

attempts to redecide, or to decide, what the rights are

between individuals, and that is where the Due Process

8

Clause joins the separation of powers -QUESTION:

But there, your due process objection

is in effect to the retroactivity of a rule applied to a

saying, yes, there is a due process problem in effect in

the very notion of retroactivity, because there can only

would occur based upon their arguments if Congress decided

QUESTION:

Weren't we -- whatever limitation

8

to determine what Congress meant.

with some judicial notion of laches.

10

MR. OLSON:

QUESTION:

We were not dealing

That's correct.
The question was, we recognize that

12

Congress has the power to set time limits.

13

any question about --

14

MR. OLSON:

There isn't

No question about that, just in the

15

same way that Congress had the power to decide whether

16

aiders and abettors could recover, just as Congress had

17

the power to decide whether buyers or sellers should have

18

a right of action under section 10(b).
My point in answer to your question is that the

19
20

statute of limitations is not some different species of

21

law.

22

limitations is an important part of the judicial process.

23

It's the part -- and this Court in Lampf decided that it

My point is that neither the Government nor my

opponent contends that there would be any difference in

this case if it was the aiding and abetting defense, or

6

the in pari delicto defense, or other aspects of the

7

section 10(b) right.

8

9

The other point that I would make is that this
was very much like a bill of attainder.

The legislative

10

history makes it clear that the Members of Congress that

11

addressed section 27A were disturbed by and unhappy with

12

this Court's decision in Lampf.

13

They named the plaintiffs that they felt --by

14

name, by individual name, that they felt were unfairly

15

deprived of their rights, they named the defendants by

16

name who they said should not benefit by their greed, and

17

therefore the decision by this Court should be set aside

18

and, furthermore, there was considerable discussion --

19

it's impossible to tell how dispositive it was -- that

20

certain Members of Congress were concerned about the fact

21

that it would make it better for the Government if more

22

plaintiffs won more 10b-5 cases because it would cost the

Government less in terms of the savings and loan bail­

opposite to the Sioux Nation decision, Congress was

2

requiring courts to set aside their judgments in order to

benefit the Government, in part.

QUESTION:

Mr. Olson, could Congress have

5

created a new cause of action somehow and waived any res

7

MR. OLSON:

I find no decision from this Court

8

that would suggest that Congress could do that with

9

respect to the res judicata effect of prior decisions when

10

individuals were involved.

11

return to the Sioux Nation point, in that case, Congress

12

and the executive branch, the Solicitor General, and this

13

Court, determined that all that was involved in the Sioux

14

Nation case was waiving the res judicata effect of a

15

judgment against the United States and acknowledging a

have been Justice Breyer's question that focused on the

2

fact that the significant reason for the separation of

3

powers discussed by the framers of the Constitution was

4

that if you concentrated power -- or the power of the

5

legislature, the power to make the law, with the power to

6

enforce the law, with the power to decide how it would be

7

applied, that would be the very definition of tyranny, so

8

the separation of powers is intended to protect individual

9

rights just as the Due Process Clause is.
I believe that the doctrine of res judicata, the

10
11

finality of judgments, is a significant and fundamental

12

component of the judicial power.

It's also something that

exists to protect individuals.

I think that I would go back --

Congress can't create a 10-year-old cause of action.

more than a means to an end, like the Sioux Nation

11

characterized the Klein situation, that Congress was

coming along, setting aside judgments in order to pick

winners and losers after the fact, and I think that that

would bother this Court a great deal from the standpoint

QUESTION:

because this statute embraces all of the weaknesses that

activity.

The interesting thing is that what Congress did

here is strip -- what this Court customarily does, as

Congress has now taken away all of that effect.

2

The rights of individuals are now as decided by Congress,

but Congress didn't change the prospective effect of the
