ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES D. HOLZHAUER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. HOLZHAUER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The primary issue in this case is whether the

12

courts should give normal deference to an arbitration

13

decision on the issue of arbitrability when the objecting

14

party asks the arbitrators to decide that issue.

15

First Options filed claims against MK

16

Investments, its president and sole shareholder, Manuel

17

Kaplan, and his wife, Carol Kaplan.

18

as to the arbitrability of the claims against MK

19

Investments, but the Kaplans objected to the arbitrability

20

of the claims against them individually.

21

There was no dispute

They withdrew those objections at a prehearing

22

conference, but 2 years later, they filed a motion stating

23

that the arbitrators had not yet ruled on their

24

objections, and asking the panel for a ruling.

25

motion included a detailed memorandum of law addressing

Their

all of the bases for arbitrability asserted by First

2

Options.

3

consideration, and ruled that the claims against the

4

Kaplans individually were arbitrable.

5

The arbitration panel gave the issue full

Respondents' arguments cannot diminish the fact

6

that they asked for and received the arbitrator's ruling

7

on the arbitrability issue, so the question is whether

8

such a ruling, like rulings on other issues submitted to

9

arbitration, is entitled to deference, or must be reviewed

10

by courts de novo.

11

Although parties are clearly entitled to an

12

initial judicial determination of arbitrability, this

13

Court's decisions in AT&T Technologies and Warrior & Gulf

14

make it equally clear that the parties can submit the

15

arbitrability issue to the arbitrators instead.

16

Now, respondents agree that if the parties

17

formally agree to submit the arbitrability issue to the

18

arbitrators for a conclusive determination, deferential

19

review may well be appropriate, but they apparently

20

believe that deference is due only if the parties enter

21

into a formal written agreement or stipulation to have the

22

arbitrators finally decide that issue.

23

There is no principal distinction --

24

QUESTION:

25

What do you have here -- what is the

closest thing to a formal stipulation to have the

arbitrator decide that you have here?

2

MR. HOLZHAUER:

We have a motion that they filed

3

with an accompanying memorandum of law saying, addressing

4

the issue of jurisdiction, and asking the arbitrators to

5

determine whether or not they had jurisdiction.

6

course, they asked the arbitrators to determine they did

7

not have jurisdiction.

QUESTION:

Of

Where did it say that moreover, we

will be content with whatever determination the arbitrator

10

makes?

11

that whenever you choose to litigate jurisdiction before

12

the arbitrator, you have automatically conceded that

13

whatever the arbitrator says goes, and I don't see that

14

that follows.

It seems to me what your case comes down to is

15

I --

MR. HOLZHAUER:

We don't say that whatever the

16

arbitrators say goes.

17

arbitrator says is in entitled to the usual form of

18

deference.

19

QUESTION:

We're saying that whatever the

Not an arbitrator's determination

20

that the parties have agreed to submit the dispute to

21

arbitration.

23

Don't you agree with that?

MR. HOLZHAUER:

The determination of whether

they've agreed to submit it to arbitration?

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. HOLZHAUER:

Yes.
I think that that is obviously

entitled to -- that should be reviewed by the Court.
In AT&T Technologies in particular, the question

2

3

was whether the parties -- the issue that was raised by

4

the dictum in that case was whether the parties had

5

clearly and unmistakable agreed to submit the

6

arbitrability issue to the arbitrators, but it's important

7

to keep in mind that in that case the issue came up in the

8

first instance in the courts.

9

QUESTION:

10

But that's a different thing than

whether the parties agreed to arbitrate at all, isn't it?

11

MR. HOLZHAUER:

12

QUESTION:

Yes, it is.

Yes, it is, but --

What was the law in the Third Circuit

13

at the time of this arbitration?

14

Third Circuit had taken the position that by objecting to

15

the arbitrator's jurisdiction, which the respondent did

16

here initially, a party does not waive the right to

17

judicial determination of arbitrability.

18

MR. HOLZHAUER:

I understood that the

The law in the Third Circuit was

19

very confused before this case, and continues to be

20

confused.

21

said that in all situations there will be judicial review

22

on a de novo basis of arbitrability determinations, but

23

the Third Circuit wasn't one of those courts.

24
25

There have been a number of courts that have

In at least four cases that I know of, the
United Industrial Workers case, the Yorkaire case, which

1

was a district court decision affirmed by the Third

2

Circuit, Pennsylvania Power, and a case called GK

3

Management, the Third Circuit took our position and said

4

that when the arbitrators argue the issue of

5

arbitrability, when the parties argue the issue of

6

arbitrability to the arbitrators, the arbitrators'

7

determination is entitled to deference, so the issue is

8

quite up in the air in the Third Circuit.

QUESTION:

Mr. --

10

QUESTION:

What if the parties were expressly

11

reserved judicial review before submitting it to the

12

arbitrator.

13

MR. HOLZHAUER:

Sure.

That's the question that

14

is posed most directly by the Ninth Circuit's George Day

15

decision.

There --

QUESTION:

17

MR. HOLZHAUER:

18

would not be sufficient.

19

The parties didn't do anything like that here, object and

20

say, we'll go on but we don't want you to reach that

21

issue.

QUESTION:

What would your position be?
My position would be that that
Now, that's not in this case.

So you would force anybody who didn't

23

want to lose the right of judicial review to litigate that

issue first.

I would force them to litigate

MR. HOLZHAUER:

Clearly they have the

If they wanted district court

7

review on a de novo basis, yes, I would say they would

8

have to go to district court at the outset, but as the

9

slew of cases that this Court sees and that we all see

10

going to arbitration demonstrates, parties submit very

difficult and complex issues to arbitration all the time.

That just seems to kind of defeat the
It just -- it complicates

I don't see why we have to do that.

MR. HOLZHAUER:

I don't think that's correct at

17

all.

18

we've had the rule for some time that arbitrability

19

determinations of arbitration will be entitled to

20

deferential review, and I don't think that there's any

21

evidence that respondents have cited or that I've been

22

able to find that in those circuits we have a difficulty

23

with arbitration --

You could even -- you could make a

MR. HOLZHAUER:

arguing at all that the parties waive or forego their

right to determination of arbitrability when they present

that issue to the arbitrator.

QUESTION:

1

the parties.

2

they're going, rather than go through the more lengthy and

3

perhaps more expensive process in the Federal courts or

4

the State courts, they're going to submit that dispute to

5

arbitration.

6

They have a dispute, and they decide that

In this case, the parties had a dispute as to

7

lots of issues, and one of the issues they had a dispute

8

as to was arbitrability, and in this case the party that

9

objected to arbitrability, the two parties that objected

10

to arbitrability, submitted that issue to the arbitrator.

11

Now, clearly --

12

QUESTION:

Are you saying there's no difference

13

between a who and a what question?

14

MR. HOLZHAUER:

Yes, as far as whether the

15

parties have the authority or the right to submit that to

16

arbitration if they want to.

17

QUESTION:

But I thought you -- I thought in

18

response to a question I asked you earlier you agreed that

19

the parties always had a right to de novo review of the

20

question of whether they had agreed to arbitrate at all.

21

MR. HOLZHAUER:

Whether they had agreed to

22

arbitrate at all?

23

that question, and no, I don't think they have a right to

24

de novo review of whether they agreed to arbitrate at all

25

if they submit that question to the arbitrators.

No, I don't think -- I misunderstood

1

QUESTION:

And you say the only way to avoid

2

submission is you don't simply say to the arbitrators, we

3

didn't agree to submit this, or we didn't even agree to

4

arbitrate, you must go into district court and get a --

5

file an unnamed action of some sort?

6

MR. HOLZHAUER:

If you're not satisfied with

7

having the arbitrators determine arbitrability, the

8

alternative is to go into court.

9

QUESTION:

But you talk about arbitrability

10

as -- when you say arbitrability, do you mean the

11

agreement to arbitrate, or do you mean whether a

12

particular part of the dispute is subject to the agreement

13

to arbitrate?

14
15
16

MR. HOLZHAUER:

Both.

Whether a dispute is

arbitrable -QUESTION:

Well, but I think you would clarify

17

things for several of us up here if you could break it

18

down and look at it as first, did a party agree to

19

arbitrate at all, and second, what did the party agree to

20

arbitrate, as Justice Ginsburg suggested in her question.

21

MR. HOLZHAUER:

I think that we can make those

22

issues quite separate, but I believe the result is the

23

same under both situations.

24

is whether somebody had agreed to arbitrate a dispute,

25

that that party has -- is perfectly entitled to submit

I believe that the question

1

that issue to the arbitrators, and I don't think that the

2

respondents disagree with that, that the parties can

3

submit the question of arbitral jurisdiction over them to

4

the arbitrators.

5

QUESTION:

Sure, but it's a question of what is

6

the reasonable implication of the mere fact that the party

7

appears to argue the point.

8

If what's at issue is whether a particular

9

action came within the scope of the arbitration or not,

10

arguing that point before the arbitrator is arguably an

11

implicit submission of the point to the arbitrator, but

12

where what your contention is quite simply,

13

Mr. Arbitrator, you have no jurisdiction over me at all, I

14

don't even want to be before you, arguing that before the

15

arbitrator is not implicitly, is in no way implicitly

16

saying, and moreover, even though you have no right over

17

me, whatever you decide is okay with me.

18

certainly not reasonable a implication to take from the

19

mere appearance in argument.

20

MR. HOLZHAUER:

That is

I disagree with that.

I think

21

that the party has the right to submit that issue, along

22

with the subject matter issue, to the arbitrators, and

23

that by going to the arbitrators and saying, okay, we have

24

this objection to arbitrability, these are the four issues

25

that we claim, reasons why we claim this is not

arbitrable, we're going to go ahead and argue those to you

2

and submit those to you along with our counterclaim and

3

along with our defense to the rest of this case.

4

QUESTION:

Are you saying if they had not done

5

that, they had just said to the arbitrator, we don't think

6

you have this authority, but we won't argue it because we

7

don't want to waive it, would they then have been entitled

8

to de novo review?

9

MR. HOLZHAUER:

That's the George Day decision,

10

and I agree with respondent's point on that.

11

thought that that would be a very inefficient and wasteful

12

way, that it would be better off having the parties argue

13

the issue of arbitrability either to the court or to the

14

arbitrators in the first instance.

15
16
17

Respondents

I also think that that kind of scheme could
result in an inappropriate form of gamesmanship.
QUESTION:

I'm not sure I have your answer.

18

they consented to a -- if they had not, would they have

19

consented had they not made these arguments before the

20

arbitrator?

21

MR. HOLZHAUER:

Had

My -- that again, you know, it's

22

not this case, but my view is that would be a waiver of

23

the argument, and I think there's a big difference between

24

waiver and deference in this case.

25

QUESTION:

Well, what's the difference also,

1

then, between that situation and the situation which I

2

thought your brief was referring to in which there is

3

simply a straight refusal to arbitrate?

4

stay home.

5

I am going to

I thought you were arguing that in the absence

6

of a default rule, you can perfectly well do that, and

7

that simply puts the burden on the other side to haul you

8

into court.

9

MR. HOLZHAUER:

Absolutely.

Under the Federal

10

Arbitration Act, under those circumstances, the parties

11

seeking arbitration would be required to file a motion to

12

compel to get that --

13

QUESTION:

So you haven't changed --

14

MR. HOLZHAUER:

15

QUESTION:

-- before them.

A moment ago, I thought you might be

16

changing your position on that --

17

MR. HOLZHAUER:

18

QUESTION:

No.

-- because I thought you said that if

19

they did not want to suffer the effects of implicit

20

agreement by submission, they would have to, they the

21

objecting party would have to go into court, and you're

22

not saying that --

23

MR. HOLZHAUER:

No, I'm not.

As I understood

24

the question, it was whether -- it was basically the

25

George Day question, whether a party can say, I object to

arbitrability.

I don't want to even waive that question

2

here because I'm afraid of waiving it.

3

the rest of the case, but I want the courts to determine

4

arbitrability de novo.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. HOLZHAUER:

7

QUESTION:

I'll go ahead with

This is -I think that should be a waiver.

Well, that's what I wonder, maybe.

8

Why should we decide this question, aside from the fact we

9

granted cert to decide it, but the -- look, as I

10

understand it, someone has a piece of paper called a

11

contract, and it's filled with references to arbitration.

12

And then they get into a fight.

13

MR. HOLZHAUER:

14

QUESTION:

Mm-hmm.

And the question is, is this part of

15

the thing subject to arbitration, and Smith says it is,

16

and Jones says it isn't.

17

MR. HOLZHAUER:

18

QUESTION:

19

Now, that fight, they're free to

submit to arbitration, aren't they?

20

MR. HOLZHAUER:

21

QUESTION:

22

That's right.

So the whole question is, have they

agreed to do it?

23

MR. HOLZHAUER:

QUESTION:

Right.

Right.

All right.

Why do we need some special rule?

MR. HOLZHAUER:

The reason we need a special

rule in this situation is because we have a Federal

16

Arbitration Act and a well announced Federal policy

17

regarding arbitration that encourages arbitration and

18

enforces agreements to arbitrate and gives strong

deference to arbitral decisions, and the question, I

think, should be is, not why should this contract question

an arbitrator be treated differently than any other

MR. HOLZHAUER:

1

Well, there also is a question

in this case, for example, as to whether Mr. Kaplan had

agreed to pay over certain money, and as to whether First

Options had agreed, or First Options had increased

Mr. Kaplan's losses and therefore was responsible for some

of those debts, and those questions were in large part

contractual questions governed by the four-part workout

I think this Court's rulings and the entire

scheme of Federal arbitration is quite clear that we don't

as we treat other contract questions.

QUESTION:

Isn't there a line of authority -- it

17

MR. HOLZHAUER:

There is, and that's often in

the rules that parties have agreed to.

19

the Philadelphia Exchange rules, there was a provision

20

that if a party doesn't show up he can be subjected to

liability, and that's one of the reason why in some

situations merely refusing to show up may not be an

adequate remedy.

that there's been a clear agreement to arbitrate in the

first place, if that can happen to you if you do agree to

MR. HOLZHAUER:

QUESTION:

The essence of your argument, I take

it, is that everything must be made a Federal case by the

alternative to either refuse to arbitrate, which can be a

viable option in some cases, or to go to Federal court

themselves, or to submit the arbitrability issue along

with everything else to the arbitrators, and in this case

that's what the parties did, and the question in this case

rule for quite some time, and we haven't found that to be

a huge problem.
The parties in those circuits defer to the --

decide to go ahead with the arbitration and have the

arbitrators decide the issue.

10

The second point is, we're not saying that the

parties get no review at that point.

MR. ROBERTS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may

it please the Court:
This Court has emphasized as recently as

Mastrobuono that arbitration is a matter of contract, of

8

agreement between the parties.

9

to enter into binding arbitration unless it has agreed to

10

do so and because arbitration involves the relinquishment

11

of constitutional rights, this Court has held that the

12

question of arbitrability -- did the parties agree to

13

arbitrate? -- is for the courts to decide, not

14

arbitrators, unless the parties "clearly and unmistakable

15

provide otherwise.

A party cannot be forced

Here, the Kaplans never signed an agreement --

QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, when you use the term,

18

arbitrability, you mean the agreement of the parties to,

the consent of the parties to have a dispute arbitrated?

MR. ROBERTS:

That's arbitrability, and the

21

question in this case is, did the Kaplans agree to

arbitrate that question, the question of arbitrability?

Did they agree to be bound by the arbitrator's decision on

question of whether a particular subject is subject to the

arbitration agreement, which the parties concededly agreed

to?

4

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, in other words, there is an

arbitration contract, and there's a dispute.

6

that's also called arbitrability.

QUESTION:

Is that --

Yes, that's what confuses me.

It

8

seems to me it's two distinct things, and people call them

the same thing.

The term is used simultaneously in

both instances.

13

think there's any arbitral jurisdiction, but we're going

14

to let the arbitrators be judge in their own case, and

15

decide whether there's arbitral jurisdiction, and in that

16

instance, as the Court said in the AT&T case, the party

17

arguing that that situation is applied has the burden of

proving that by a clear demonstration of evidence and

Yes, I do, and particularly --

So you think there's no difference in

the two instances?
MR. ROBERTS:

I think as a practical matter in

applying the standard there may be a difference when you

12

have a conceded agreement to arbitrate, and the parties

13

said yes, there is an arbitration agreement between us,

14

but we don't think this issue is within it.

15

There, it may be more likely that that would go

16

to the arbitrators, but when the basic claim is, we never

17

agreed to arbitrate at all, then I think you have the

18

clearest case for judicial determination and no deference

19

to the arbitrators.

20

QUESTION:

Well then, you are making a

21

difference between a personal jurisdiction question and a

22

subject matter jurisdiction question.

23

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, I think a subject matter

jurisdiction question is also a question of arbitrability.

I guess what I'm saying is that

far -- it's far less likely that you would defer to an

QUESTION:

Well

Why isn't that a submission to the

MR. ROBERTS:

First, it's very unclear whether

5

those were compulsory counterclaims or not, and once the

6

Kaplans -- first of all, Mrs. Kaplan did not submit any

7

counterclaims, so that rationale would not apply to

8

submitting her to arbitral jurisdiction, but once the

9

arbitrators had decided to go forward, it would have been

10

foolhardy for Mr. Kaplan to sit on his rights and not

11

raise his claims so that they wouldn't have a full picture

12

of what happened under his version of the facts.

13

There's no requirement.

If you have objected to

14

jurisdiction, done your best to explain to the arbitrators

15

why they have no jurisdiction, and they're going to go

ahead anyway, you had better put in your side of the

different question, once they agreed to arbitration, what

2

was the scope of the arbitration from, did they ever agree

3

to arbitrate.

4

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, arbitration is a matter of

5

contract, and the question is, is this within the scope of

6

the contract, and if, for example, you have an agreement

7

with a broker to arbitrate issues, disputes with respect

8

to investments, and you're walking down the street, and

9

your broker happens to be driving by and hits you, your

10

tort suit is not subject to that arbitration agreement,

11

and it seems to me that that's as clear as a situation

12

where you have a contract between First Options and MKI

13

Investments with an arbitration clause, and they try to

14

say, well, because of that contract, you, Mr. and

15

Mrs. Kaplan, have to arbitrate.

16

It seems to me that the distinction is between

17

the scope of the contract and not whether it covers

18

individuals or events.

19

arbitrate can single out particular disputes and events,

20

and can single out particular individuals.

of draw fine lines as to what you were rough and ready

about.
But on the question of whether you decide or

4
5

agree or not to appear before an arbitrator in the first

6

place, that in fact is an agreement sort of to be

7

distinguished, because if you didn't agree to that, then

8

nobody can claim that, in effect, you asked for a rough-

9

and-ready procedure and that's what you got, so why don't

10

you say that there is, in fact, a superior value to be

11

served by making this distinction between subject and

12

person, and the person agreement at least must be clear

13

and unmistakable, regardless of what the subject agreement

14

is?

15

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, I suppose it's a workable

16

distinction, although I think it may have been just backed

17

to where we were a while ago, in suggesting when you have

18

a conceded agreement to arbitrate between parties, the

19

questions are going to be closer than when the basic

20

dispute is over whether there's an agreement at all.

QUESTION:

So simply by varying the standard,

we'd get to the same point that we would get to on your

close when you get into agency and so on.

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, again there are questions,

though, about the scope of a conceded agreement.

6

the questions are not close, and you're in AT&T's clear

When the

Now, the approach of the Third Circuit, which is
also the approach in the First, the Fourth, the Seventh,

10

and the D.C. Circuits, allows arbitrators to consider

11

jurisdictional objections in the first instance without

12

penalizing a party by saying that it forfeits its right to

13

a judicial determination of arbitrability.

14

The main benefit of that approach is that it may

15

obviate the need for court involvement at all if the

16

objecting party wins, if the arbitrators arrive at a

17

compromise, or if the development of evidence before the

18

arbitrators dissuades the objecting party from pursuing

19

its objection.

20

Petitioner's approach would require, as counsel

21

he never agreed to arbitrate, and will not be defaulted,

6

or prevented from later getting review.

7

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, that depends on what the

8

rules of the arbitration forum provide.

Here, the rules

9

of the Philadelphia Exchange said if you don't show up,

10

the arbitrators can go ahead without you, and so what the

11

petitioner apparently would have us do is show up, because

12

we don't want a default entered, object in some way so

13

that we don't waive our objection, but don't say too much,

14

because if we say too much, then we're going to be held to

have submitted the issue to the arbitrators.

That's a very fine line, and it's a fine line in

17

an area where the Court has emphasized we don't want fine

18

lines.

19

to arbitrate arbitrability, you have to show that by a

-- and not as individuals, but as --

some issue here about whether, was it Manuel Kaplan was

You had in the workout agreement four separate

The court of appeals concluded that that was

Only one contained an arbitration clause.

10

That was signed only by First Options and MKI, and the

11

Kaplans only signed one, and it did not contain an

12

arbitration clause.

13

Now, the district court, reading those, said

14

well, we're going to read them altogether so that

15

everybody arbitrates, but it seems to me the more natural

16

reading is to say, they knew how to put an arbitration

17

clause in the contract when they wanted to, and they

18

didn't put one in the one that the individual signed.

QUESTION:

Did the district court hear live

important to consider why we defer to arbitrators'

decisions on the merits when we do defer.
It is not because of any presumed experience or

Parties can

MR. ROBERTS:

When the very question is, is there an

agreement to be bound, there's no basis for deference.

Now, we didn't hear much about the Federal

Arbitration Act from the petitioner, and I think the

reason is that it strongly supports the Third Circuit's

position.

arbitration vacatur of an arbitral decision if the

12

arbitrators exceeded their powers.

13

The Federal Arbitration Act provides for post

It doesn't provide any mechanism for a

prearbitration determination of arbitrability on the part

15

of an objecting party.

16

is no such judicial remedy, but we do think it's hard to

17

argue that the act contemplates only prearbitration

18

judicial determinations of arbitrability when the only

19

mechanism in the act is for post arbitration

20

determinations of arbitrability, and if you look at

21

section 10(a), it seems clear that the 10(a)(4)

22

determination that the arbitrators exceeded their powers

is one that calls for de novo judicial review.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES D. HOLZHAUER

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. HOLZHAUER:

17

I think everyone in this case agrees that the

18

parties are entitled to allow the arbitrators to decide

19

the issue of arbitrability.

20

do that, or how they signal that, whether that has to be

21

for some reason especially clear and unmistakable, and

that the action of submitting it to the arbitrators itself

25

Thank you.

The only question is how they

based on a misreading of this Court's cases in John Wiley

4

and Sons, Warrior & Gulf, and AT&T Technologies.
In none of those cases, remember, had an

5

arbitrator decided the issue of arbitrability, and the

7

central principal underlying those cases is not involved

8

here.

9

The issue there was whether the courts could

10

compel a party to submit a dispute to arbitration without

11

first determining that the party had agreed to arbitrate.

12

As the Court put it in John Wiley, a compulsory

13

submission to arbitration cannot precede a judicial

14

determination because a party can't be compelled to

15

arbitrate if arbitration does not bind it at all.

19

done so, they're bound by the result, and the only

question that really is before this Court is whether their

act of submission constitutes an agreement to submit that

22

issue and have it considered in a binding way by the

23

arbitrators.

As Mr. Roberts pointed out, the case could wash

in many ways before the arbitrators, so the issue -- there

MR. HOLZHAUER:

Right.

If they want to do that,

6

if they want to preserve judicial review de novo, they

7

have to get the court to do it initially.

objection, and that should suffice, but that's not this

case and shouldn't be decided here.

There's no initial objection here, there was actual

I think the notion that there's some special

magic to going to court and getting a de novo review is a

manifestation of the old hostility to arbitration.

Parties submit this issue to arbitration all the time.
