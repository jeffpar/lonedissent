CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. McCONNELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
It is common ground in this case that if a group

12

of students satisfied all of the objective eligibility

13

requirements to form a student newspaper, or in the terms

14

of the university guidelines, a student news, information,

15

opinion, entertainment, or academic communications media

16

group, that they could not be excluded from funding under

17

the guidelines simply because they espouse a controversial

18

or otherwise political, ideological, philosophical

19

position of a secular sort.

20

Thus, if my clients this morning were the SDS,

21

if they were vegetarians, if they were members of the

22

Federalist Society, or black separatists, or whatever,

23

there would be no need to be here this morning.

24

QUESTION:

What if they were Republicans?

25

QUESTION:

That's just the question I was going

to ask.
(Laughter.)

2

MR. McCONNELL:

3
4

Well, then I'll ask Democrats,

just to make it -(Laughter.)

5

MR. McCONNELL:

6

Your Honor, even if they were

7

Republicans or Democrats, they would not be excluded,

8

because under the university's guidelines, an otherwise

9

eligible organization is not excluded merely because it

10

espouses political viewpoints within its activities, no

11

matter how unpopular those may be.

12

Your Honor, this case is different because my

13

clients are not the SDS or the Republicans, they are --

14

their orientation is religious.

15

QUESTION:

You have to help me a little more on

16

this question.

17

me.

18

political groups such as Republicans and Democrats.

19

wrong on that?

20

I thought -- I don't have it in front of

I thought there was a provision that did exclude

MR. McCONNELL:

Am I

Your Honor, there are two

21

relevant exclusions for political groups.

One of those is

22

for political organizations, and it might very well be

23

that an organization set up affiliated with the Republican

24

or Democratic Party could be excluded at the University of

25

Virginia on that ground.

Of course, that is not

applicable here.

My clients are not affiliated with any

2

national or other religious organization.
QUESTION:

3

Would not the rule that you are

4

arguing for entitle such a political group also to get

5

funding?
MR. McCONNELL:

6

Your Honor, the guidelines

7

expressly provide, and I refer to page 66 -- 65 to 66a of

8

the appendix to the petition.

9

provide that these restrictions on funding political

The rules specifically

10

activities are not intended to preclude funding of any

11

otherwise eligible student organization which espouses

12

particular positions or ideological viewpoints, including

13

those that may be unpopular, or that are not generally

14

accepted.

15

As I understand this rule, Your Honor, the point

16

is that if there's an organization that is simply engaging

17

in electioneering, or lobbying, which are much more

18

narrow - - much narrower categories than the espousal of a

19

viewpoint, that such groups can be excluded, but groups

20

cannot be excluded because they are expressing even

21

controversial political viewpoints in a student newspaper.

22

QUESTION:

As I understand it, Mr. McConnell,

23

there are two bases for exclusion of religious

24

publications.

25

religion -- I mean, if it's a prayer group, or something

One is if the organization practices

1

like that -- and then there's a separate one if the

2

publication exhibits religious belief?
MR. McCONNELL:

3
4

That's right, Your Honor, and

there's been no - QUESTION:

5

And the latter does not apply to the

6

political exclusion.

If you exhibit the belief of a

7

Republican, your publication is not necessarily excluded,

8

although if you are a Republican, Young Republicans or

9

something like that, you would be excluded.

10

MR. McCONNELL:

11

QUESTION:

That's exactly correct.

Whereas for religions, if you are

12

either a religious group or you exhibit religious belief,

13

you're out.

14

MR. McCONNELL:

That's correct, and there's been

15

no claim in this case that my clients are a religious

16

organization.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. McConnell, the religious

18

provision to which Justice Scalia refers is an activity

19

which primarily promotes or manifests a political belief

20

in and about a deity or an ultimate reality.

21

provision you say is the equivalent of exhibiting.

22

MR. McCONNELL:

23

QUESTION:

That's the

Exactly.

Yes, I see, and the political one is

24

an organization primarily involved, and so forth and so

25

on.

I don't see the dramatic difference between the two

provisions that you rely on.
MR. McCONNELL:

The difference is the language

3

that I was just reading a moment ago, which excludes from

4

the definition of political activities the mere, 65a to

5

66a, very top of the page of 66a, are not intended to

6

include funding, preclude funding of any otherwise

7

eligible student organization which 3) espouses particular

8

positions or ideological viewpoints.

9

QUESTION:

Yes, but they're not otherwise

10

eligible, if they fall within the political

11

organization --

12

MR. McCONNELL:

By otherwise eligible, I assume,

13

Your Honor, that they're referring to the criteria for

14

being a news, information, opinion, entertainment, or

15

academic media group.

16

I might add here, I'm not sure that this is --

17

QUESTION:

You acknowledge that the Young

18

Republicans would still be excluded, that that exception

19

would not let the Young Republicans run a newspaper that

20

espouses Republican views.

21

Republican political organization, no?

22

MR. McCONNELL:

They would be excluded as a

Your Honor, whether the -- the

23

Young Republicans would presumably be a political

24

organization, but that is not --my clients have not been

25

excluded because they are a religious organization.

are not a religious organization.

I'm just asking about

Republicans would not be able to publish a magazine of

Republican viewpoints.

You acknowledge the Young

MR. McCONNELL:

Under the guidelines, that's

exactly correct.
QUESTION:

But any other organization, if it's

not a Republican organization, would be?
MR. McCONNELL:

That's right, and the very same

11

students could get together and put out a newspaper.

12

fact, the Virginia Advocate, which is a funded

13

organization, looks very much like the sort of newspaper

14

the Young Republicans would publish, and that is funded.

15

QUESTION:

Let me make sure I understand you.

16

You agree that a Republican publication would be

17

prohibited by the guidelines.

18

may constitutionally be prohibited by the guidelines?

In

MR. McCONNELL:

Do you also agree that it

Your Honor, the line that we

20

believe that this Court's cases establish, and that the

21

First Amendment imposes, is a line that prohibits

viewpoint discrimination.

all political organizations whatever their orientation or

24

persuasion, our position is that that is not

unconstitutional.

QUESTION:

Well, do you agree that it would not

be unconstitutional to deny funding to a publication that

says, vote Republican in the next election?

QUESTION:

Those other newspapers are not

affiliated with an identified partisan organization, I

suppose, or at least in theory they're not.

MR. McCONNELL:

identified with any religious denomination or other

organization.

Let me point out - -

QUESTION:

Suppose -- just on this one point,

20

suppose the religious newspaper engaged in soliciting

21

members, proselytizing, coupons to fill out and return

22

that are contained in the newspaper, does that change the

23

case, or make it a more difficult case?

wouldn't think that Wide Awake would be any more precluded

from inviting others to join in Wide Awake's activity than

That cannot be equated with the

political restrictions against campaigning.

MR. McCONNELL:

Well, again I don't think that

the Virginia Advocate is precluded from trying to persuade

students to join the Virginia Advocate, or to join in its

causes, and -QUESTION:

QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor --

It's one thing -- it seems to me the

distinction is made, it's one thing to recruit members of

recruit adherence to God, to religious tenets.

QUESTION:

You admit the distinction, don't you?

2

MR. McCONNELL:

Your Honor, I'm not at all sure

that a distinction of that sort would be administrable.

I'm not -- I don't know how you can tell the difference.

Just as there is a Marxist world view, there is

10

a libertarian world view, there are a number of world

11

views, and one is either convinced of the truth of those

12

world views or not, and those world views have application

13

to numerous issues, such as the questions that are

14

addressed in this magazine.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. McConnell, may I ask you a

question that I think fits into this same line of inquiry?
You argue for an overarching principle of

18

neutrality, and you say, if we will look at the program

19

and see if it's neutral, that should be the test, and do

20

you think that means that Government must never single out

21

religion in legislating, or do you think that the

22

constitutionality of a program under the Establishment

23

Clause depends on its effects, its overall effects with

24

respect to religion?

25

MR. McCONNELL:

Well, Your Honor, I can imagine

1

situations in which the Government might be operating

2

according to formally neutral criteria that have such

3

disproportionate effects that one suspects that there's a

4

religious gerrymander going on.
QUESTION:

5

Would some of our school funding

6

cases fall in that category, where the Court spoke in

7

terms of well,

8

schools that will benefit are religious schools, and so

9

forth?

10

if we support this,

MR. McCONNELL:

95 percent of the

Yes, Your Honor, and in each of

11

the parochial school cases the Court went out of its way

12

to point out that the category, ostensibly neutral,

13

private schools, is a category that in fact contained

14

overwhelmingly religious schools, and more than that,

15

overwhelmingly religious schools of one particular

16

religious denomination.

17

And I think that those cases can be understood

18

as the Court's reaction to - - not to aid which is general

19

in nature to viewpoints of all sorts, but rather to aid

20

which the legislature knew, everyone knew,

21

knew, was being enacted in response to the needs of a

22

particular -- to religion in general, but especially to

23

one particular religious denomination.

2

think it's appropriate to look at the effects of the

publication?
MR. McCONNELL:

Well, Your Honor no.

I think

that it's appropriate to look at the effects of the

Government's action.

7

drawing categories that have disproportionate effect, thus

8

leaving us room to suspect that there's a religious

That is, if the Government is

gerrymander going on, we should look at effects in that
10

sense, but just as in Widmar v. Vincent, this Court was

11

not concerned with the students benefiting from free

12

facilities at the university might try to gain members, or

13

recruit people to the Presbyterian Church, or whatever.

14

All that mattered to this Court was that all

15

groups, all student groups at the University of Missouri

16

were being given an equality of free speech rights, and

17

that is our position here.

18

I might - - on this - - on the question of the

political groups, I just want to remind the Court of one

20

thing.

21

sense upon whether the university is allowing or

22

disallowing the Republicans, because remember in Lamb's

23

Chapel, two terms ago, a unanimous decision of this Court

that the school -- that the policy at issue, there,

25

expressly allowed political activities as well as - - and

excluded religious activities.
QUESTION:

The --

Mr. McConnell, may I ask you a

3

question directed specifically to religious activities and

4

the state of our precedent?

5

Is there any decision so far that has authorized

6

a direct cash contribution from the State organ in support

7

of a religious activity?

8

MR. McCONNELL:

9

Your Honor, I think that the

closest case to that is the Witters decision, in which

10

direct cash payments were made for vocational education at

11

the Inland Empire School for Bible for courses in biblical

12

studies and training to become a minister.

13

QUESTION:

Not for a purpose directed by the

14

State, that is, vocational education, but for a pursuit

15

that the religious group -- that the group engaged in an

16

avowedly religious activity has charted for itself.

17

don't -- I'm not aware of such a case.

MR. McCONNELL:

Well, Your Honor, in this case,

the University of Virginia is not channeling money to

religious groups.

QUESTION:

It is trying to support the activity of

Well, I just -- Mr. McConnell, I just

wanted to know if there was any precedent.

education, and you said, that's the closest case to this

You gave me

1

one.
MR. McCONNELL:

2

And Your Honor,

I'd like to urge

3

you that that is in fact a very close parallel, because --

4

and there the State was supporting vocational education.

5

Here,

6

both cases the State is completely,

7

completely indifferent as to whether the individuals who

8

benefit or participate in those programs themselves decide

9

to participate,

the State is supporting student journalism, and in
or should be,

to use those benefits in a way that

10

participates in a religious activity, because the

11

establishment --

12

QUESTION:

There's a distinction in this case,

13

because the claim is that the very nature of the

14

publication itself is an espousal of religion.

15

your phrase, a religious activity, so there's nothing left

16

to chance here.

17

MR. McCONNELL:

It is, in

But, Your Honor, the very

18

activity in Witters was a religious activity, too.

19

Witters was engaged in learning about --he was studying a

20

religion,

in a deeply, pervasively religious way.

21

The point is that the establishment --

22

QUESTION:

Well,

is it your point that so long

23

as the criterion for giving out the aid is at a

24

sufficiently high level of generality that it does not

25

identify religious purpose as its object, e.g.,

funds for

1

education, funds for publications, that that is the end of

2

the inquiry about a possible establishment violation?
MR. McCONNELL:

3

Yes.

To use this Court's words

4

in Texas Monthly, when a subsidy is distributed to a broad

5

array of organizations, both religions and secular on the

6

basis of objective criteria, the fact that some of the aid

7

may go to religious advocacy does not violate the

8

Establishment Clause.

9
10

QUESTION:

Unless it's a gerrymander.

You do

make that exception.

11

MR. McCONNELL:

12

QUESTION:

That's right.

You could have it at a very general

13

level, but if, in fact, the way it winds up is that all

14

the money is going to one sect, that might be a different

15

situation.

16
17
18

MR. McCONNELL:

But here, of course, there is an

extraordinarily broad array of groups.
QUESTION:

On your criterion, then, if the State

19

were to dispense funds for moral betterment, it could make

20

direct cash payments to any organized religious group.

21

MR. McCONNELL:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. McCONNELL:

QUESTION:

25

Your Honor, if a group --

Well, isn't that the -I do not think --

-- consequence of what you just said?

1

that we know the object, absent a gerrymander, is not a

2

peculiarly religious object, that makes it okay.
MR. McCONNELL:

3

No, Your Honor, because in order

4

to administer that category, money to morally uplifting

5

groups, the Government would have to decide whether a

6

religious group is in fact morally uplifting.

7

agree that such an inquiry on the part - -

determine is

MR. McCONNELL:

Your Honor, so much depends

upon -- it depends upon the practice with which such a

3

category was administered.

virtually anyone who espoused any views that was remotely

related to the good life received money, I think that

6

would be fine, but if in fact it meant that the Government

7

was engaged in a searching, case-by-case inquiry, deciding

8

this group promotes the moral life and this group doesn't,

9

then that kind of selective funding I think would be

If, in fact, that meant that

10

unconstitutional, and religious groups could not be

11

included, because then the Government would be putting its

12

imprimatur upon particular religious views and saying

13

these are good views.

14

Here, the only thing that's going on is that the

15

Government has found that this is a student news, opinion,

16

entertainment, or academic media group.

The - - as I was saying, the religious nature of

the students is what makes this a case different from

cases that even the university concedes are correct about

7

Now, there are two ways in which the religious

8

9

character of their viewpoint might be considered relevant.

10

One is the university's position, which is to draw the

11

line between religious and nonreligious is not viewpoint

12

discrimination.

13

plainly foreclosed by this Court's unanimous decision two

14

terms ago in Lamb's Chapel, I would like to turn instead

MR. McCONNELL:

Yes, but even with -- Your

17

Honor, even within the context of a State university, the

18

State university is in some cases speaking itself, and in

19

other cases it is providing a platform or a means for

20

private speakers to be able to speak their own minds.

21

That distinction is central to our position, and

22

it is our view that the Free Speech Clause protects

23

private speech where the content and viewpoint are

initiated by the private speakers, that it protects

private speech against viewpoint-based discrimination

Indeed, it is not at all clear to me why one

sensible to take a step back and look at how the

should lead a holy life, spread the Gospel, make social

justice, follow the Holy Spirit, and pursue intellectual

QUESTION:

But isn't there a difference between

when the university decides, you know, what kinds of

subjects to teach, say, in its Department of Religion,

where it's putting out its own message, and where the

MR. JEFFRIES:

That is entirely correct.

They're not -- well, the first part is entirely correct.

They are not devoted to espousing a particular point of

14

QUESTION:

But according to a case like Widmar

15

v. Vincent, where you're talking about student activities

16

like this, you can't exclude religion.

17

MR. JEFFRIES:

Mr. Chief Justice, Widmar makes

18

explicit reference to the fact that it is not intended to

19

apply to funds.

20

QUESTION:

So you say providing space, or

21

facilities and lighting and so forth, in doing that the

22

university can't discriminate, but if instead of that it

23

decides to make cash payments, it can?

24

MR. JEFFRIES:

That's exactly right, and the

university does not discriminate in any way.

If I may just explain why that --

QUESTION:

Well, you could really help these

people out and even the playing field by not distributing

your student activity subsidies in cash, just provide

printing presses for all these organizations.

would be okay to give these people what they want.
MR. JEFFRIES:

9

Then it

Justice Stevens said in Widmar

that if access were short, that is, if it needed to be

10

rationed, that would warrant the university giving access

11

on the basis of the content of speech.

12

The distinctive fact about higher education, and

13

about public education generally, is that owing to the

14

demand at peak hours, classroom space always is in

15

abundant supply after hours, so on the facts of Widmar, on

Yes, ma'am, and I agree with’

Justice Stevens that if access needed to be limited either

MR. JEFFRIES:

Mr. Chief Justice, my

understanding of the Widmar and Lamb's Chapel line of

Could I go to a question peculiar to

Your opponents say that your argument there is

specious, because you rely upon cases in which the

Government is deciding, as it were, to speak for itself,

and it can decide what speech to make, whereas the

University of Virginia is not speaking for itself, it is

speech side of it?
QUESTION:

10

Let me try to state as clearly as I

11

,can, since the briefs are so different in their emphasis

12

on the Establishment Clause, what we think the relevance

13

of that question is to this case.

14

Petitioners say that the fact that this case

15

involves funding doesn't matter at all, and they rely

16

heavily on access cases, Widmar, Lamb's Chapel.

17

the fact that this case involves scarce dollars is

18

decisively important, and we rely very heavily on Regan,

19

and also on Rust v Sullivan.

We say

From petitioner's point of view, the

20
21

Establishment Clause is a grave problem, because there are

22

many decisions of this Court stating that where religion

23

is involved funding does matter, that it matters quite a

24

lot.

So petitioners are essentially coming to the

Clauses need to be distinguished within an inch of their

tell from the exchange, including the exchange among

it is only the first step in petitioners' argument.

That is, as you can

Petitioners not only want this Court to overrule

8

Establishment Clause cases and permit Government to give

9

direct aid to religious activities where other activities

get such aid, petitioners want to go farther.

1

2

They write it a news -- they write it

in a little magazine.
MR. JEFFRIES:

3

All those may be published, and

4

they all may be published in a newspaper which publishes

5

lots of points of view.
QUESTION:

6

And isn't it the case that when you

7

were using religious speech in this argument, and when

8

Virginia is deciding what it means to fund, specifically

9

when Virginia uses the word manifest, aren't you, in each

10

instance, talking about speech which does not merely

11

explain a point of view, but espouses it, speech which in

12

effect recognize the difference between, this is a way of

13

thinking, and speech which says, this ought to be your way

14

of thinking.

15

in your entire argument, and in these guidelines as you

16

read them?

17

Isn't that the distinction that is implicit

MR. JEFFRIES:

Yes, sir, and as those guidelines

18

are applied, they focus for the hallmarks of a religious

19

activity on observances or proselytizing, which we do not

20

wish to fund.

21

QUESTION:

Was there a finding of proselytizing

22

intent as the basis for the -- I don't find that anywhere

23

in the record.

25

I think manifest means manifest.

Do you mean that it would be okay if this group
said, we're not going to try to convert anybody, we just

consequences on a whole range of public issues?

MR. JEFFRIES:

4

QUESTION:

5

The opening --

Would that be accepted?

The

university will accept that publication?
MR. JEFFRIES:

6

It might be, depending on the

7

facts more carefully defined.

Oh, but in theory, it would.

to answer Justice Souter the way you did.
MR. JEFFRIES:

12

The only reason I haven't said

13

yes is because I don't know enough about your hypothetical

14

magazine to have a confident reaction to it.

15

QUESTION:

It may be tough to identify it as one

16

or the other, but the distinction is a distinction that

17

the university would honor, isn't it?

18

MR. JEFFRIES:

19

QUESTION:

And that is -- yes, sir, exactly.

And the university would -- who wrote

20

these regulations for the university, then?

The

21

university would consider that that -- such a publication

22

does not manifest a particular belief?

23

is, Christianity provides these answers to a whole range

24

of certain -- that magazine does not manifest a particular

25

belief?

It's whole basis

MR. JEFFRIES:

1

I think the best answer I can

give you is that the magazines in the record do manifest a

religious belief.

Christians to live in word and deed according to the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. McCONNELL:

12

Mr. Chief Justice, I'd just like

13

to conclude with a practical observation about the real

14

impact of -- on free speech of the Government's use of the

15

power of the purse.

16

Effectively, Ronald Rosenberger and his fellow

17

students were enabled to put together a newspaper, and

18

there's a carrot dangling in front of them, and the carrot

19

has attached to it something about their speech, that they

20

can address issues if they want to, but if they want to

21

receive the carrot, they have to do them in a particular

22

way.

23

They have to censor their own religious

24

viewpoints, they have to make sure that they don't quote

25

from one book, the Bible.

They could quote from others.

They have to
QUESTION:

2

I don't think that's what your

brother is saying.

4

is, they cannot cross that line between saying, this is

5

the Christian viewpoint, and this ought to be your

6

viewpoint.

7

certainly admits it.

8

only censorship that we're talking about.

9

I think what your brother is saying

Now, that may be a tough line to draw.

But that, it seems to me, is the

MR. McCONNELL:

Your Honor, if their viewpoint

10

were secular, they're certainly entitled to write a

11

magazine saying, this is our viewpoint, and you should

12

share that viewpoint.

13

precisely that.

14

Every other group is permitted to proselytize, which I'd

15

just like to note is nothing but an ugly word for

16

persuade, which is just exactly what the Free Speech

17

Clause is designed to protect.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

21

Animal rights groups are doing

Feminist groups are doing precisely that.

They like the word manifest.

Thank you,

Mr. McConnell.

The case is submitted.

24

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
