CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. FELDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case arises out of the conviction of

11

respondent, a United States Federal District Court judge,

12

on two counts.

13

obstruction of justice in violation of the omnibus clause

14

of 18 U.S.C. section 1503, and it was based on his attempt

15

to obstruct a grand jury investigation by making false

16

statements to FBI agents that he knew would be reported to

17

the grand jury.

18

The first count charged him with

The second count charged him with disclosing a

19

wiretap application in violation of 18 U.S.C. 2232(c).

20

That -- the court of appeals reversed the first count on

21

the ground that his conduct could not constitute

22

obstruction of justice as a matter of law, and it reversed

23

his conviction on the second count on the ground that the

24

wiretap that he disclosed had already expired by the time

25

he disclosed it.

QUESTION:

Mr. Feldman, no charge was brought

2

under section 1512, I take it.

3

MR. FELDMAN:

4

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And do you think the conduct here

5

would have been covered by 1512?

6

MR. FELDMAN:

7

covered.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. FELDMAN:

10
11
12

13

I think it likely would have been

Might have fitted it rather closely.
I think it likely would have been

covered under section 1512.
QUESTION:

Why was no charge brought under that

section, do you suppose?
MR. FELDMAN:

Well, I think the main reason is

14

that respondent's conduct, if you looked at what he did,

15

was aimed -- it was felt was aimed directly at the grand

16

jury investigation, and that therefore the count that had

17

to do with obstruction of a grand jury investigation was

18

the most appropriate count.

19

About a month before he made the false

20

statements to the FBI agents, his coconspirator informed

21

him there was a grand jury investigation going on, and he

22

said he was concerned about what would happen if he was

23

subpoenaed to testify.

24

At the beginning of the interview with the FBI

25

agents, almost at the very early stages he asked, am I a

1

target, a term which he later testified was known to be

2

used by FBI agents in connection with grand jury

3

investigations.

4

At the end of the interview, near the end of the

5

interview when they asked him, do you have any questions

6

for us, his response -- almost his first response was

7

first whether, again, whether he was a target, and

8

secondly, expressing concern that he might be indicted,

9

and finally, when he testified at trial in this case, he

10

specifically said that he knew that his statements would

11

be reported to the grand jury, at least at the end of the

12

interview.

13

Now, the --

14

QUESTION:

15
16
17
18

Did the FBI agents testify before

that grand jury, the ones that talked to him in Honolulu?
MR. FELDMAN:

At least Agent Carlon did.

I'm

not sure whether the other one did or not.
QUESTION:

Was there any showing, or was it the

19

Government's theory that they were more or less in charge

20

of bringing the matter to the grand jury?

21

MR. FELDMAN:

I don't think there was a feeling

22

that they were in charge of bringing it to the grand jury,

23

because I don't think the count rested on any showing that

24

they were in charge of the investigation.

25

of the --he was trying to get false information to the

His obstruction

1

grand jury in the same way that somebody who alters or

2

destroys documents is trying to get that false information

3

to a grand jury.
The medium he chose, which was an effective one,

4
5

could have been an effective one, was through the --

6

making false statements to the FBI agents that he knew

7

would be reported to the grand jury, but I don't think

8

their status as being in charge of the investigation was

9

essential to the charge, or even important.
QUESTION:

10

Was he charged under, what is it,

11

1001, for simply making false statements to an executive

12

official in the performance of his duties?

13

MR. FELDMAN:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. FELDMAN:

No, he wasn't charged under 1001.

That would have applied, wouldn't it?
In our view that would have

16

applied.

17

very expansive view of what's been called the exculpatory

18

no doctrine, and it's not clear to me whether it would

19

have or wouldn't have in the Ninth Circuit.

20

hard to make that out.

21

I do have to say that the Ninth Circuit has a

It's kind of

But in any event, the reason he was charged

22

under 1503 as opposed to that count was, once again, that

23

when the case was analyzed it was seen that his conduct

24

was aimed directly at the grand jury investigation, and

25

that therefore that was the most important and the most

1

2

appropriate charge to bring before the trial jury.
QUESTION:

Mr. Feldman, I suppose if we went

3

about statutory interpretation sort of in the usual way

4

and looked at the series of related statutes, 1503 and

5

1512, and we looked at them cold, we'd probably say, well,

6

1512 is the one which is obviously aimed at this

7

situation, and so the catch-all in 1503 probably shouldn't

8

be construed to cover it.

9

As I understand, as I recall your brief, an

10

answer to that is that in fact 1512(b) in fact does not

11

have the same kind of coverage that 1503 would have on

12

your theory.

13

distinctions are?

14
15

Would you explain to me what the

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, 1512 in some respects is

broader than 1503, and --

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. FELDMAN:

18

QUESTION:

That's the omnibus character.
Right.

But I thought there was another

19

distinction that you were making, and I don't remember

20

what it was.

21

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, I think the main point would

22

be that section 1503 is a catch-all provision, and it

23

covers a great deal of conduct that doesn't have anything

24

to do with what would be covered by section 1512.

25

QUESTION:

Well, yes, but that's always true of

1

a catch-all, so --

2

MR: FELDMAN:

Right, and I think it's also, I

3

guess I would -- I'd just --

4

QUESTION:

But I mean, if that were the

5

distinction, then in effect the catch-all would always be

6

duplicative of the more specific statute on your theory,

7

then.

8

9

MR. FELDMAN:

But I don't think that that's true

that it would always -- it has some overlap both with the

10

earlier clauses of section 1503, with section 1512, and

11

with some of the other obstruction of justice statutes,

12

but the fact that it has that overlap is necessarily a

13

result of the fact that it is an omnibus clause and a

14

catch-all clause.

15

conduct that's not covered by section 1503.

16

QUESTION:

Those other statutes in turn cover

Mr. Feldman, though, did I understand

17

you correctly in answer to Justice O'Connor's question

18

that you didn't have doubts about the fit of 1512, that

19

you would think that 1512 did fit, but for whatever reason

20

you chose 1503 instead.

21

MR. FELDMAN:

I do think he could have been

22

charged under 1512.

23

prosecutions that there's a number of different statutes

24

that would apply to a given defendant's conduct, and it's

25

up to the prosecutor to decide which is most appropriate.

It's not uncommon in Federal criminal

1

I'd also point out that under section 1512 the penalties

2

are -- I think the monetary penalty is five times as high,

3

the term of imprison -- the maximum imprisonment is twice

4

as high, and there are differences of that sort between

5

the two statutes that might make one -- that might go into

6

the decision as to which one to charge, but the main

7

reason was that we felt that his conduct was aimed

8

directly at the grand jury, and that that's what should be

9

charged.

10

I'd also say that I don't think that it's

11

appropriate to construe a catch-all provision such as 1503

12

by first looking to other provisions and seeing what the

13

coverage of those is and cutting out holes from 1503 to

14

correspond to other provisions.

15

1503 has always been understood to cover not

16

only some of the territory that the other provisions

17

cover, but some of the territory that they don't cover,

18

and where the conduct comes within the plain meaning of

19

the omnibus clause of section 1503, there's no reason to

20

then look at some other statute to see that even though

21

it's within the plain meaning of that omnibus provision,

22

we're going to cut a hole for 1512, or 1513, or 1508, or

23

any of the other obstruction of justice statutes.

24
25

QUESTION:

Mr. Feldman, what is the closest case

in the courts of appeal supporting your position in this

1

case?
MR. FELDMAN:

2

Well, before -- well, I think the

3

closest case probably is the Grubb case, United States v.

4

Grubb.

5

the court of appeals in that case reversed the conviction

6

on grounds that are not that clear to me, so we wouldn't

7

agree with the result in that case.

There was also the Wood case, where, of course,

But in addition to that, even before 1982, when

8

9
10
11
12

Congress made the change and enacted -- when Grubb was
enacted -QUESTION:

The Grubb case was testimony before

the grand jury, wasn't it?

13

MR. FELDMAN:

14

QUESTION:

I beg your pardon?

Wasn't the Grubb case testimony

15

before the grand jury?

16

MR. FELDMAN:

No.

The Grubb case was testimony

17

to an FBI -- it was statements that were made to FBI

18

agents that were investigating, just as the agents were

19

here, and would be reported back to the grand jury.

20

In addition to that, before -- even before 1982,

21

when section 1512 was enacted, there was a case called

22

Hawkins, which we cite at page 19 of our petition, that

23

involved very similar conduct, also false statements to

24

FBI agents.

25

QUESTION:

In your earlier case, was the FBI

agent acting sort of specifically as the grand jury's

2

agent at the time?

3

grand jury, in effect, requested the agent to gather

4

information?

Was he going back and forth and the

MR. FELDMAN:

5

There's no -- as far as I can

6

tell, and certainly as far as you can tell from the

7

reports of any of those cases, there's no reason to think

8

that he was acting any closer, in any closer connection to

9

the grand jury than the FBI agents were here.
That is -- you have to remember that as the case

10
11

comes to this Court, there was a pending proceeding and

12

respondent knew that that pending proceeding was going on.

13

He also knew that his false statements would be reported

14

to the grand jury.

19

That's what he told the jury, the

I think, in fact, he was right, because there

I think that's as close a connection as

Respondent has argued that you need some kind of

20

"direct nexus" between the defendant's conduct and the

21

grand jury in order to be charged under the omnibus clause

of section 1503.

not one that any court of appeals has ever used in

24

connection with this statute.

25

I don't know what that term means.

1

connection, in that ordinarily people don't -- ordinarily,

2

in order to be said to endeavor to obstruct something, you

3

ordinarily would use some means that has some capability

4

of affecting that proceeding that you're trying to

5

obstruct, we don't have any quarrel with it, but I don't

6

know how directness would be measured, and nor do I see

7

anything in section 1503 that distinguishes between direct

8

and indirect, or allows you somehow to draw degrees of

9

directness and say well, this is direct enough to be

10
11

prosecuted under 1503, and that is not.
If the defendant's intent is to obstruct the

12

grand jury, and if there's a pending proceeding and the

13

defendant knows that that pending proceeding is going on,

14

his conduct is -- can be prosecuted under the omnibus

15

clause of section --

16

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose under the omnibus

17

clause you could prosecute a person for lying before his

18

own -- at his own trial on the witness stand.

19

MR. FELDMAN:

20

You probably could.

21

QUESTION:

I think that's probably right.

What about the word "corruptly"?

22

Does that add anything to -- is a plain lie enough?

23

so, then "corruptly" doesn't seem to add anything on your

24

view of it.

25

MR. FELDMAN:

If

I think "corruptly" has, I think,

1

uniformly been construed by the courts of appeals to mean

2

that you need the specific intent to obstruct, and in fact

3

it has a number of different meanings depending on what

4

the specific offense probably is that's being charged,

5

because there's such a broad range of conduct that does

6

come in within the omnibus clause.

7
8

QUESTION:

Well, then it's still redundant.

Doesn't "endeavor" bring in intent?

9

MR. FELDMAN:

I think in combination with

10

"endeavor" it brings into intent.

11

"endeavor" was added -- the history of the statute is that

12

"endeavor" was added in order to eliminate the niceties of

13

the law of attempt of the statute.

14

QUESTION:

I mean,

"endeavor" --

Can I read you an entry in Black's

15

Law Dictionary?

16

term generally imports a wrongful design to acquire some

17

pecuniary or other advantage."

"Corruptly.

It appears in a lot of statutes, and it usually
means by bribery, to do it corruptly.

MR. FELDMAN:

In other words I think what Justice

22

Ginsburg and I are asking is, how much of a -- you say

2

force, or by any threatening letter or communication.
MR. FELDMAN:

I think, first the jury was

3

instructed in this case that respondent had to be trying

4

to obtain some advantage for himself, and they found that

5

he was, and in fact he was trying to obtain an advantage

6

for himself.

7

the grand jury, and he was trying to avoid being indicted

8

in improper ways, so that -- as far as the definition that

9

you read, I think that this case satisfies it easily.

10

He was trying to avoid being called before

QUESTION:

But a lie would be a deliberate

11

falsehood, would be for some purpose, and my concern is,

12

you seem to be reading this as though "corruptly" just

13

wasn't there, to add nothing more than a deliberate or

14

conscious factor to it, but that's what a lie is.

15

consciously tell an untruth.

16

MR. FELDMAN:

You

In some -- I guess the -- stating

17

the fact that the defendant has lied is not itself a

18

statutory term.

19

why that would create a problem.

20

that you have to have the specific intent to obstruct.

21

I mean, I'm not sure that I understand
"Corruptly" indicates

There's been numerous cases, not only about

22

false statements made directly to a grand jury, but

23

about -- I think a core application of section 1503 is the

24

alteration or destruction of documents for presentation to

25

a grand jury, and that conduct really is identical to the

1

conduct that respondent engaged in here, except that

2

instead of by altering a document and giving that to the

3

grand jury, you're making a statement to the FBI agent

4

that will bring an equally false piece of information

5

before the grand jury.
QUESTION:

6

Maybe we can get at my problem this

7

way.

8

not fit because it isn't corrupt, that is a false

9

statement, but would not fit within the catch-all but is

10

Can you give me an example of something that would

not corrupt?
MR. FELDMAN:

11

I guess -- I don't know if I -- I

12

can't think of an example offhand for that, but again, I'm

13

not sure why the fact of whether -- why you -- false

14

statement cases may, just like alteration or forgery of

15

document cases, may always be corrupt, because whenever

16

they're altering or forging a document knowingly, it's

17

going to be a corrupt action in the sense that the statute

18

means it.

19

I suppose if the defendant was not trying to

20

gain any benefit for himself or other, someone else,

21

perhaps it wouldn't be corrupt in that sense, although

22

it's hard to envision a case where the defendant would

23

engage in that --

QUESTION:

Is the answer to what's bothering

people possibly an historical answer?

Is this particular

1

point of drafting, the use of the word "corruptly,"

2

something from the -- a much earlier statute?

3

thinking of is, I can remember reading old statutes that

4

speak of feloniously, for example, committing acts.

What I'm

5

Well, the fact that they're made crimes by the

6

statute means, in a sense, they're all feloniously done,

7

and all that's trying to pick up is the general notion of

8

criminal intent.

9

in this statute, that it's sort of a piece of antique

10

drafting?
MR. FELDMAN:

11
12

I think so, except the only

thing --

13
14

Are we in the same boat with "corruptly"

QUESTION:

Do you know when it first appeared in

the statute?

15

MR. FELDMAN:

It was in the statute at least as

16

far back as the Pettibone case 100 years ago in 1893, or

17

'92.

18

to the origin of the statute, which was, I think, 1831.

19

I'm not sure -- I have a feeling it may well go back

QUESTION:

Mr. Feldman, your time is going to be

20

21

defendant was charged, section 2232(c), giving notice or

MR. FELDMAN:

1

It's our theory that he actually

2

did give notice, although only an attempt would be

3

necessary for violation of this statute.
I think the dispute about that provision

4
5
6

centers -QUESTION:

Is over the fact that at the time of

7

the defendant's action the wiretap authorization had

8

terminated?

9

MR. FELDMAN:

Right, and the question is

10

whether, when the statute says, what he has to disclose is

11

the possible interception, really the dispute concerns the

12

meaning of the word "possible" there.

13

Now, what the statute requires is that a

14

defendant have knowledge of either an authorization or an

15

application to intercept telephone communications, that he

16

act in order to obstruct such interception, and that he

17

give notice of the possible interception.

18

Now, when you talk about the interception that

19

might result from an application or authorization for

20

wiretapping, the interception has to be understood to

21

extend not simply to the initial period of up to 30 days

22

that you can get an order for, but any additional

23

extensions of that period that might be added, and

24

respondent plainly thought that that's what had occurred

25

in this case, when 5 months after he found out about the

1

authorization he gave notice -- he gave notice to the

2

target of it in order to obstruct it.
In our view, the term, "possible," there, was

3
4

used to tie back into the first clause of the statute.

5

That is, it ordinarily will be the case that a defendant

6

will not know whether interception actually is going on,

7

and defendant didn't know that in this case.

8

all the defendant will find out about is an application or

9

an authorization.

10

Ordinarily,

He doesn't know what's happened to it

after that.

11

And so when Congress referred in the final -- in

12

the last part of the statute to the possible interception,

13

what they -- what Congress was referring to is, what he

14

has to disclose is that of which he has knowledge, that

15

there is a possible interception, and that's the act of

16

disclosure that's prohibited.

17

In other words, if the defendant goes to someone

18

and says,

19

be an interception on your phone.

20

better not talk on the phone."

21

of violating the statute.

22

"There's a possible interception, or there might
I heard about it.

You

Then I think he's guilty

That, I think, is clearly the meaning of the

23

term "possible" in the statute, and I don't think there's

24

any question that defendant violated -- that respondent

25

violated it.

Now, respondent says, and the court of appeals

1

2

believed, that the term "possible" was a term of

3

limitation on the statute, and that Congress wanted to let

4

the people who disclose a statute with -- a wiretap with

5

intent to disrupt it should be -- should not be able to be

6

prosecuted if for some reason entirely unbeknownst to them

7

the interception is not going on, or can't go on.
If, for instance, the target is deceased, if the

8

9

target's moved to a new house and isn't at the same

10

telephone number anymore, if the target's already been

11

informed of the wiretap, and therefore wasn't going to be

12

talking on the phone under any circumstances, or if the

13

wiretap has expired, as happened in this case.

14

But I don't think that there's any reason why

15

Congress would have created a -- would have written a

16

statute, and I really find it hard to believe that

17

Congress would have wanted to create those kinds of

18

windfall defenses that are based on the fact that the

19

defendant didn't know about the -- didn't know about the

20

fact that he's now saying precludes his prosecution.

21

QUESTION:

Is there some disagreement in the

22

lower courts about the impossibility question?

23

there is.

there's only one or two other reported decisions.

I think

The charge to the jury with respect

to the 1503, would that have been different if the

8

respondent had been indicted under 1512?
MR. FELDMAN:

9

I don't

It would have been -- I -- you

10

know, I -- it would have been -- you would have had to

11

show under 1512 was that there was an official proceeding,

12

and in this case you had to show there was a pending

13

proceeding.

14

out to the same thing.

15

I think it really, as a matter of law, works

QUESTION:

So could respondent perhaps be

retried under 1512 without the bar of the statute of

limitations?

MR. FELDMAN:

It's possible that he would be

able to.
I can't definitively say whether he would or

21

not, but I do think that -- I do think it's important in

22

this case that -- to realize that the omnibus clause of

23

24

cover lots of territory, not only territory that's also

other statutes but also far beyond that, that when

2

Congress enacted 1512, they would have had no way to know

3

the courts would later -- and at that point they didn't

4

change the omnibus clause at all.

5

Congress would have had no way to know that courts later

6

would come along and construe the statute as if they had

7

narrowed the scope of the omnibus clause.
In fact, what Congress knew at that time was

9

They would have had --

that, as in the Hawkins and Haldeman cases that I was

10

talking about before, was that people had been prosecuted

11

for conduct that was very similar to the conduct that

12

respondent engaged in here, and they also knew that the

13

omnibus clause of 1503 was not limited to simply covering

14

gaps that weren't covered by other statutes, that it was

instead intended to cover a broad range, including many

things that were covered by other statutes.

Yes, there were.

There were

11

the answer to this, is imagine, say, that the defendant

12

says something about the tap, but his motive is simply to

tell his relative why he shouldn't come to the house, or

suppose that he isn't really interested in whether or not

MR. FELDMAN:

I don't think so, and I don't

think that that kind of guesswork is what I'm talking

about when I say that he knows that it's expired.

7

think it's whether he's guessing that it might be expired,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. LUSKIN:

12

13

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

14

By this prosecution, the Government seeks to use

15

two statutes, section 1503 and section 2232(c) of

16

Title XVIII, in ways in which they have never been

17

employed before.

and capriciously extend the scope of those statutes

without safeguarding a single interest that those statutes

20

are designed to protect.

Their construction would dramatically

With respect to section 1503, it's the

Government's position that the words of the statute, in

themselves.

clearly.

If they do, they do not speak loudly or very

1

The omnibus clause in essentially its present

2

form has been on the books for more than 150 years, and

3

with the possible exception of the Grubb case, this is the

4

first prosecution in which the Government has attempted to

5

use the omnibus clause to reach simple false statements to

6

undisclosed potential witnesses before the grand jury.
The Government's construction of section 1503 is

7
8

flawed in at least two distinct respects.

In the first

9

place, simply on the basis of its terms, the Government

10

through this prosecution ignores the significant

11

qualitative distinction between the types of conduct that

12

have been traditionally punished under the omnibus clause

13

and the type of conduct it seeks to punish here, and in

14

the second place, the Government's construction of the

15

omnibus clause ignores its place in the statutory scheme

16

of which it plays but a small part.

17

Since 1982, Congress has made as clear as it

18

could possibly make it that misconduct in relation to

19

witnesses, and specifically misconduct in relation to

20

witnesses that is expressly covered under the terms of

21

section 1512, should be prosecuted there and nowhere else.

22

QUESTION:

Well, are you saying that Congress in

23

1982, Mr. Luskin, impliedly narrowed the omnibus clause of

24

1503?

that Congress narrowed the scope of 1503 and by doing

that, yes, impliedly narrowed the scope of section 1503.

3

There was nothing implied about what it did to section

4

1503, which was to eliminate --

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. LUSKIN:

It took witnesses out.
It took everything in relation to

7

witnesses out, and it's important to bear in mind the

8

Government's theory of this prosecution, which is that

9

Judge Aguilar, by his false exculpatory statements to the

10

FBI, influenced the FBI agents as potential witnesses so

11

that they would convey false information to the grand

12

jury.

13

QUESTION:

How, mechanically, did Congress

14

accomplish this process of narrowing the omnibus clause?

15

It didn't rewrite any of the language in the omnibus

16

clause.

17

MR. LUSKIN:

No, sir.

I would say that this is

18

a paradigm example of what this Court recognized in

19

Fausto, which is that when Congress reorganizes a coherent

20

legislative scheme, that it's important to go back and

21

look at the prior text with a view towards what Congress

22

attempted to accomplish in the future.

the Government suggest it be used here.

1

Well, that's a perfectly good

2

argument for saying it shouldn't be used that way after

1982, but it's not a very good argument for saying that

4

Congress changed the meaning of the clause in 1982.
MR. LUSKIN:

5

What I think it is, it's an

6

argument to say that in looking at what Congress

7

accomplished in section 1512, it's important to look at

8

the prior statutes, as this Court did in Fausto, with a

9

view to what the Court was trying to accomplish.

10

What

Fausto --

11

What Congress was trying to --

MR. LUSKIN:

to repeal a prior construction of the Back Pay Act, which,

by negative influence from the new statutory scheme,

should no longer be maintained.

implied repeal is disfavored, and as I understood it,

you're not -- are you relying here on the doctrine of

implied repeal?

23

MR. LUSKIN:

No, sir.

common sense rule of where the Congress enacts a coherent,

in this case wrongful conduct in relation to witnesses or

potential witnesses, it's important to go back and look at

other historical provisions with a view towards what

Congress was trying to accomplish.
QUESTION:

7

Well, if we disagree with you that

8

somehow the amendment of section 1512 affected the meaning

9

of the omnibus clause in 1503, if we disagree on that, do

10

you place reliance on the meaning of the word "corruptly"

11

in 1503?
MR. LUSKIN:

12

Well, if we were solely to look at

13

section 1503, Your Honor, I think what we place reliance

14

on is corruptly endeavoring to disrupt the due

15

administration of justice.

16

provision, which arose out of the Court's -- the Congress'

17

effort to codify the contempt provision, required a nexus

What I'm saying is that there are really two

that one does outside the court could eventually have some

8

impact on something that happens in the court, but the

9

other thing that I'm suggesting is that it has a

11

qualitative component as well.
And I think this Court's decision in In Re

Michael, which was a contempt case but was also

13

considering the question of the due administration of

14

justice in which the Court said that even perjury in court

15

was not necessarily obstructive of the due administration

of justice unless it could be demonstrated qualitatively

17

that there was a risk of harm, and all of the cases relied

18

upon by the Government, have one of two defining

19

characteristics that's just not present here.

In the first place, where the grand jury

21

affirmatively exercises its authority to secure particular

22

testimony, for example by a subpoena or by compelling the

attendance of a witness before the grand jury, it's

perfectly clear in those circumstances that wrongful

No, ma'am.

I think, for example --

and I think the destruction of evidence cases are

perfectly good examples of that.
Where the grand jury has expressed its interest

in a particular subject matter, or seeing a particular

The second defining characteristic, Your Honor,

is affirmative conduct by the defendant that substantially

It makes a difference only insofar

Your Honor, and it's been captured by the decisions of the

Tenth and Eleventh Circuits in the Wood and Thomas cases,

is to impose a requirement that in addition to this

I think what's called out for here is some

notion in addition to the but-for causation which the

whether or not Judge Aguilar had any idea that there was

desire to influence anybody who might be a witness in that

I think the closest charging analogy here would

be,

of course,

1001, which is the provision under which

these charges are traditionally brought and,

it's our speculation here that the reason that it wasn't

done so was that Judge Aguilar was initially charged also

10

with a substantive RICO offense under section 1962 (c) ,

11

which this act was charged as a predicate offense of

racketeering.

14

MR. LUSKIN:

I'm not sure why there

Well, as a practical matter, Your

and had the FBI agents actually believed the exculpatory

false statements that Judge Aguilar had made, as a

statements would not have been reported to the grand jury,

in fact, testify to the grand jury on this matter.

The Government's theory is that they were linked

by the fact that the FBI agents as potential, undisclosed

witnesses before the grand jury, might have carried Judge

Aguilar's false statements in to the grand jury and

thereby confused them.

difference between our position and that of the Government

one, and one thing only, and that is the integrity of an

the second place from the statute from which that

MR. LUSKIN:

That's correct, but in the final

14

clause, which defines the class of disclosures which may

15

not be made, the way in which Congress has defined that is

16

to say he may not disclose a possible interception, and

17

that doesn't modify the defendant's state of mind, it

18

defines the class of things which may not be disclosed,

19

and I think the Government moves "possible" back into the

20

state of mind.

Mr. Luskin, you're discussing

possible interception as though it means possible

Congress to punish the disclosure of an application.
If you were to find out from me, and I were an

FBI agent, that I'd applied for a wiretap but the court

16

had not yet ruled on it, and you were to disclose that

17

fact, you would be disclosing the existence of a possible

interception, and the interception is possible because I

have applied for it but it hasn't been received.

MR. LUSKIN:

And I think that that confuses two

separate statutory provisions, Your Honor.
Section 2518(8), which allows the continuation

22

of a secrecy order, allows that secrecy order to be

23

continued for good cause, and that good cause can include

24

any number of things, including protecting the integrity

of an ongoing criminal investigation.

There would not

I think looking at it precisely the opposite

10
11

way, the Government's construction of this statute would

12

lead to altogether absurd results, which is that if an

13

individual under section 2518 were to receive notice of

14

the existence of a wiretap and were mistakenly to believe

15

that that statutory notice under section 2518 meant that a

16

wiretap was still possible, or might, indeed, be in

existence, and were to disclose that fact for the purpose

18

of thwarting the wiretap, under the Government's view of

the statute, that individual who has received required

statutory notice would violate section 2232(c).

there's no possibility of harm.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS A. FELDMAN

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4

MR. FELDMAN:

I just had two brief points I

5

wanted to make.

6

the questions that arose concerning Agent Carlon's

7

testimony, section 1503 is a statute that prohibits

8

endeavors, and the one principle that's been quite clear

9

from this Court's decisions about the statute is it

10
11

First, with respect to section 1503 and

prohibits endeavors to obstruct justice.
Therefore, although it's not important whether

12

Agent Carlon actually testified, what is crucial,

13

especially in light of counsel's argument, I think, is

14

that respondent himself testified at trial that he knew

15

that the false statements that he made to Agent Carlon

16

would be reported to the grand jury, and I think that's

17

what makes it sufficient to violate the statute.

18

With respect to section 2232(c), I think that

19

I'd just like to make two other brief points.

20

the statute was clearly designed not just to address, to

21

be retributive of an actual evil that occurred, an

22

obstruction of an interception, but to have a broader

23

deterrent effect.

24
25

One is that

That's clear from the legislative history of
the -- aside from the language of the statute.

I think

1

it's clear from that, but also the legislative history,

2

which where the -- both the Senate and House committee

3

reports on the statute describe in identical terms the

4

coverage.

That is, it is intended to deter.
QUESTION:

5

May I ask you a question that's

6

troubling me, Mr. Feldman?

7

there's a wiretap, and knows that it authorizes

8

interception of X's conversations with Y, thinks it

S

authorizes X's conversations with Z, but in fact, it

10

doesn't.

He tells Z.

Does he violate the statute?

MR. FELDMAN:

11

Supposing the defendant knows

I guess that would -- I think that

12

would depend on whether in the first clause of the statute

13

it -- what it is that he has to have knowledge of, when it

14

says

he has to know of an application or authorization.

15
16

QUESTION:

He knew about the application.

He

knew --

17

MR. FELDMAN:

18

QUESTION:

Right.

There was an existing application.

19

He knew --he thought it was a little broader than it was,

20

and he, for bad purposes, told the person who's not

21

affected by it at all, with the intent to violate it.

22

Would that violate the statute?

23

MR. FELDMAN:

24
25

I think -- it's hard -- I tell

you, frankly, it's hard for me to tell -QUESTION:

seems to me.

2

MR. FELDMAN:

3

QUESTION:

4

I --

It's -- that's sort of lateral rather

than vertical, but it's the same sort of impossibility.
MR. FELDMAN:

5

No, I really don't think it is.

6

Well, at least in this case it's clear that what he knew

7

and what he repeatedly said he knew was that there was an

8

interception going on.
QUESTION:

9

He's wrong about that, just as in my

10

hypo he's wrong about the person who might be affected by

11

it.
MR. FELDMAN:

12

Yes, well, I mean, I suppose in

13

that -- in the case that you posit, I think he could be

14

prosecuted for that, too, if he acted in order to obstruct

15

the interception that he knew about -- so long as he knew

16

about it, and as long as what he acted was in order to

17

obstruct it, and what he said was, there's a possible

18

interception, again referring back to what his actual

19

knowledge was.
QUESTION:

20

What do you do about the last example

21

that Mr. Luskin gave about someone who receives notice of

22

a wiretap and --

23

MR. FELDMAN:

I don't -- I do a couple of

24

things.

authorization, and what you get at the end of the process

2

is knowledge of a completed wiretap, not necessarily an

3

application or an authorization.
QUESTION:

4
5

So you're saying that the knowledge

he gets would preclude the intent which is necessary?

6

MR. FELDMAN:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. FELDMAN:

9

In some sense --

I think it would be likely to be.

But for that, though, you'd have him.
Well, I think also because there

would be the question of whether you would construe that

10

to be knowledge of an application or an authorization, not

11

just merely because of the fact that it's completed, but

12

it's not -- what he's finding out there is the inventory

13

of the actual conversations, not the application or

14

authorization.
