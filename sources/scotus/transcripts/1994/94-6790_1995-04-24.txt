ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN D. BOYLE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BOYLE:

8

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Petitioner Harvey Garlotte has been confined in

10
11

Mississippi since 1985 under a consecutive term of 3 years

12

imprisonment and two follow-on concurrent life terms.

13

In this habeas action, Mr. Garlotte challenges

14

the conviction that resulted in the 3-year term, and the

15

question in the case is whether Mississippi's treatment of

16

all of Mr. Garlotte's consecutive sentences as a single,

17

essentially general sentence for penalogical purposes

18

means that Mr. Garlotte was in custody for purposes of

19

habeas corpus when he began this action in 1989.
QUESTION:

20

What do you mean by saying

21

Mississippi treated it as kind of a generic sense, or

22

something like that?

23

but I gather it's something of importance to your

24

argument.

25

MR. BOYLE:

I didn't catch your exact phrasing,

Well, we argue, Mr. Chief Justice,

1

that Mississippi essentially aggregates, or treats as

2

unitary, a series of consecutive sentences, and by that I

3

mean the prisoner is assigned a single date of parole

4

eligibility, which turns on the total period of

5

confinement, not on the individual sentences, the order in

6

which those sentences have been prescribed is irrelevant

7

to the prisoner's release date, and such penalogical

8

functions ds calculating earned time, calculating good

9

time, those functions are made on the basis of the total

10

term of confinement, so I analogize consecutive sentences

11

to a general sentence for multiple convictions.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. BOYLE:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. BOYLE:

And what is a general sentence?
A general sentence -That's simply a single sentence?
Your Honor, a general sentence at

16

common law was a single term of confinement for

17

convictions upon multiple counts.

treats consecutive sentences, administers them as a

QUESTION:

marijuana conviction were set aside the petitioner would

MR. BOYLE:

Our argument, Justice O'Connor, is

that Garlotte is being held under all of his convictions,

21

including the marijuana --

I know that.

I'm asking whether

MR. BOYLE:

2

Looking at the marijuana sentence

alone, Your Honor, no, he was not marking time on that

MR. BOYLE:

When he first challenged it.
When he first brought his Federal

petition, when he first went to Federal court.

matter of debate in terms of when he first went into State

9

court to exhaust his State remedies.
QUESTION:

10

It's a

Of course, your position is that he

11

was serving time on that, because you can't separate the

12

time on that from the time on the rest.
MR. BOYLE:

13

That's precisely our position, that

14

it's impossible to parse the consecutive sentences that

15

Mr. Garlotte is serving under, and indeed inappropriate to

16

do so, because the State doesn't do so for any penalogical

17

purposes.

18

QUESTION:

Well, surely it's not literally

19

impossible to parse.

20

say, but one can tell a 3-year sentence from a much longer

21

sentence, I take it.

22

MR. BOYLE:

Maybe it's inappropriate, as you

I think that's right, Mr. Chief

Justice.
Let me make a slightly different point.

1

marijuana sentence is somewhat separate from the question

2

whether he's being held under the marijuana conviction,

3

and as I answered Justice O'Connor's question,

the marijuana sentence alone, he is not -- he was not

That had expired by the time he - Well, the State insists that it

expired at that point.
QUESTION:

Well,

if it was a sentence for 3

years, one can tell simply by looking at State law,

11

suppose, whether or not it had expired.

MR. BOYLE:

I

Looking at the sentence

individually, that's correct, Your Honor.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. BOYLE:

Yes.
But you have a different argument,

16

as I understand it, based on Peyton.

17

reason the sentences were amalgamated in Peyton in order

18

to be able to "anticipate" a sentence for purposes of

19

habeas attack was to satisfy the jurisdictional

20

requirement that he be in custody.

21

Well,

You're saying the

if you can amalgamate in order to

22

anticipate, the you've got to follow the same

23

jurisdictional rule when in fact you're looking backwards,

24

so I think you're -- you have a separate argument saying

25

you can't have Peyton for jurisdictional purposes and not

1

allow me to attack, i.e. on the basis of custody for

2

jurisdictional purposes, and that's a separate argument,

3

isn't it?

4

you're saying you can't have it both ways.

5

I mean, that's an argument based on Peyton, and

MR. BOYLE:

That's correct, Justice Souter.

The

6

principle that derives from Peyton is that a prisoner

7

serving consecutive sentences is in custody under any one

8

of those sentences for the balance of his confinement.

9

QUESTION:

Well, maybe it wasn't principle that

10

was driving Peyton.

Maybe it was a practicality that was

11

driving Peyton.

12

makes up these categories.

13

know, whether it's separate or amalgamated.

14

how you choose to look at it, and we choose to look at it

15

as amalgamated in Peyton in order that you didn't have to

16

wait a long time before you could try the factual matters

17

necessary to determine the earlier incarceration, but in

18

this case that practicality cuts in precisely the opposite

19

direction, doesn't it?

20

Why can't you say, you know, the law

MR. BOYLE:

There's no such thing as, you
It's simply

Oh, undoubtedly there were practical

21

considerations that motivated the Court in Peyton, and

22

those you described, and it is clear that the rule that we

23

propose would permit Mr. Garlotte to challenge his

24

marijuana conviction for as long as he remains in iron bar

25

confinement in Mississippi, just as it would permit

1

another prisoner serving a life sentence to challenge that

2

life sentence for as long as he remains confined.

3

But the practical considerations that motivated

4

the Court in Peyton led to a principle in the case that

5

obviously spans beyond the narrow factual circumstances

6

that the Peyton Court confronted, and the principle is

7

that the prisoner serving consecutive sentence is for all

8

intents and purposes really serving a general sentence on

9

multiple convictions, and can bring the petition in time.

10

QUESTION:

Was there any rhyme or reason to the

11

sentence order, Mr. Boyle?

12

was indifferent.

13

MR. BOYLE:

I think the prosecutor said he

That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.

14

At the sentencing hearing the prosecutor expressed total

15

indifference to the order in which Garlotte would be

16

required to serve his sentences, and for good reason.

17

doesn't matter for purposes when he will -- for purposes

18

of the most important event for the State and the

19

prisoner, which is when he might be released into the

20

community, the order in which those sentences appear in

21

the commitment order makes no difference.

22

QUESTION:

It

Is there a reason the judge might put

23

the longer sentence first and the shorter sentence second,

24

or the other way around, as in this case, the shorter one

25

first and the longer one second?

1

MR. BOYLE:

No reason that occurs to me, except

2

perhaps -- and we don't make this argument at all here --

3

except perhaps to foreclose collateral review if we're

4

wrong here.

5

I think we've canvassed the cases pretty

6

carefully in Mississippi, and there's no - - appears to be

7

no rhyme or reason to the order of sentences such as we

8

have here, a short, fixed period of confinement followed

9

by a consecutive life term.

10

In many cases, you find the life sentences first

11

to be followed by the fixed terms of imprisonment, and in

12

that instance, of course, the prisoner becomes eligible

13

for parole, eligible for release without having even begun

14

serving the fixed terms of imprisonment that follow the

15

consecutive sentences -- follow the life terms, so I think

16

that provides a handy illustration of how consecutive

17

sentences really do amount to a general sentence.

18

QUESTION:

May I ask -- you've been very careful

19

each time to say he's eligible for parole earlier if the

20

shorter sentence is set aside.

21

Missouri -- Mississippi law on the following hypothesis.

22

The -- say there's no bail or anything pending appeal.

23

The person starts serving a sentence immediately, and the

24

short sentence is fully served before the appeal process

25

is over, and the appellate court sets aside the short

So it's not just eligibility for

He would in fact get the earlier -MR. BOYLE:

Right.

One of the other features of

8

consecutive sentences that we point out in our opening

9

brief is that time served, or time marked under one of the

10

consecutive sentences is really only provisionally

11

credited against that sentence.

12

If one of the sentences positioned earlier is

13

invalidated for any reason, subject -- or pardoned, the

14

later consecutive sentence sort of slides forward, and the

15

person gets full credit, and that's another point we make

16

about -- or another basis for our conclusion that

17

consecutive sentences really do amount to a single,

18

general sentence upon multiple convictions.

19

QUESTION:

Whereas if you had been sentenced to

20

that separately and then had been released, and then

committed another crime, and then later it was disclosed

that you didn't actually commit the earlier crime, that's

this reason.

I don't think States want to be in the

2

position of giving a prisoner an opportunity to bank time

3

under an unconstitutional conviction they can apply

4

against a future offense.

5

I've described Mississippi law, and how

6

Mississippi's position on the custody question is

7

inconsistent with the statutes that define Mr. Garlotte's

8

custody, but Mississippi's position is likewise

9

inconsistent with its own actions in administering Mr.

10

Garlotte's sentences, and profoundly inconsistent.

11

one hand, we're told that Mr. Garlotte's sentence expired

12

and was supposedly beyond redetermination, beyond

13

adjustment, sometime between 1988 and 1986.

14

15

On the

It's hard to

It depends on when you look at it.
But in 1992, pursuant to recently enacted

16

legislation, the Mississippi Department of Corrections

17

credited a significant amount of earned time, meritorious

18

earned time to Mr. Garlotte's confinement.

19

was that his marijuana sentence was cut in half, and the

20

Mississippi Department of Corrections credited the time

21

that was freed up against the life sentences.

22

The net result

Now, I don't know how that action can be

23

reconciled with Mississippi's position here that the

24

sentence is over and done with and beyond adjustment.

25

The critical point I'd like to make is that the

1

credits that were awarded in 1992 remain reversible, and

2

for as long as Mr. Garlotte is in iron bar confinement.

3

think that illustrates how the marijuana conviction

4

restrains Mr. Garlotte throughout the aggregate duration

5

of his confinement.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. BOYLE:

Why is that reversible?
The Mississippi statutes which are

8

cited in the -- or quoted in full in the appendix to our

9

brief provide for the computation of earned time, or

10

commutation on the basis of the total period of

11

confinement when a prisoner is under consecutive

12

sentences, and separate provisions of Mississippi law

13

provide for forfeiture --

14

QUESTION:

I

So if he misbehaves later, the earned

15

time that he got earlier which shorted his marijuana

16

conviction will be put back on the marijuana --

17

MR. BOYLE:

18

long as he remains in prison.

That's right, Your Honor, for as

19

If he violates -- I can't remember the exact

20

words, but if he commits a serious violation of prison

21

rules 20 years from now the State, under my reading of the

22

Mississippi statutes, can withdraw that earned time, and

23

in that situation, of course, he will be deemed to have

24

begun technically serving the life sentences a year-and-

25

a-half later.

1

Now, Mississippi contends that the so-called

2

discharge dates of each consecutive sentence must be,even

3

though they're irrelevant for penalogical purposes in

4

Mississippi, they have to be treated as sacrosanct by

5

Federal courts in confronting a habeas challenge.

6

I think that argument is the one that is

7

foreclosed by Peyton, and quite clearly so.

8

that case tried to block a prisoner from challenging the

9

second of two sentences -- I think they were 30- and 20-

Virginia in

10

year sentences -- in that case on the ground that he'd

11

only been in prison a few years and hadn't yet begun to

12

serve the second term.

13

Observing that the prisoner in that case had a

14

single parole date under Virginia law, the Court held that

15

he was for all practical terms serving a 50-year sentence

16

and it would be treated as such for habeas purposes.

17

Essentially, what the Court held is that the

18

sentence under which a prisoner is technically marking

19

time is - - that question whether the prisoner is marking

20

time under the challenged sentence is a separate one from

21

whether he is held or in custody under the conviction, and

22

that's amplified by some of the Court's other decisions,

23

Hensley v. Municipal Court, Estelle v. Dorrough, and

24

Braden v. 30th Judicial District Court, which permit a

25

prisoner to challenge confinement that he is scheduled to

1

serve in another jurisdiction before that -- before he's

2

begun to serve that confinement.
I think the theory is that in that situation the

3
4

prisoner is not only being held by the first jurisdiction

5

to discharge the first sentence, but he's also being held

6

in anticipation of serving another sentence.

7

Mississippi relies a great deal on Maleng v.

8

Cook, and submits that the issue has already really been

9

decided in Maleng, but all Maleng held was that a sentence

10

or a conviction that no longer poses any present

11

restraints on a prisoner does not become a source of

12

custody for purposes of Federal habeas corpus simply

13

because it's been used to enhance a sentence upon a

14

subsequent conviction.

15

QUESTION:

Do you think it's fair to say,

16

Mr. Boyle, that neither Maleng nor Peyton cover the facts

17

of this case, that one is on one side and one is on the

18

other?

19

MR. BOYLE:

I think that's fair, Your Honor.

20

The actual facts of Peyton were such that the prisoner had

21

not yet begun to serve the sentence he was challenging.

22

QUESTION:

And the actual facts of Maleng were

23

that the sentence had been served and was not affecting

24

his present custody at all.

25

MR. BOYLE:

That's correct, but the sentence at

1

issue in that case was not imposed consecutively.

2

was no basis to conclude that the earlier sentence that

3

had been used, or earlier conviction that had been used to

4

enhance the subsequent sentence was somehow aggregated or

5

combined into a single sentence by the jurisdiction for

6

purposes of such things as parole eligibility,

7

commutation, and so forth.

8

There

The only continuing influence of that prior

9

conviction, in fact, was the prisoner's status as a felon,

10

which was obviously influential to the sentencing judge in

11

the subsequent conviction in seeing that the prisoner is a

12

danger and thus enhancing the sentence.

13

I think the principle to be derived from Maleng

14

is that in that situation where a prior fully expired

15

conviction is used to enhance a sentence for a subsequent

16

offense, that the source of the prisoner's injury and the

17

proper object of his habeas petition is that subsequent

18

sentence, that subsequent conviction, and that's in fact

19

what the Court held in that case.

20

jurisdiction over the claims in the case, but albeit

21

through the subsequent offense and subsequent sentence.

Now - -

practical effects of what you urge us to do here.

That

convictions on the basis of evidence that's, I mean, 20,

2

30, 40 years old.

3

You're saying anyone who's serving under

4

consecutive sentences can now go back, even though he

5

didn't raise the challenge at the time, and challenge a

6

sentence, 2, 3 year sentence that he served at the

7

beginning of his incarceration.

8

create that kind of problems for the State and Federal

I agree that, Your Honor, that

14

Mr. Garlotte delayed inexcusably his habeas petition here,

15

and I think our position is that the jurisdictional scope

of the statute, which Congress delimited in terms of

confinement, in terms of custody such that a prisoner

serving a life sentence could conceivably wait 40 years

before bringing a habeas challenge --

The State doesn't argue that

mitigates that argument somewhat in that a petition can be

to -- or the jurisdictional inquiry as ill-suited to try

It seems Rule 9(a) is

I'd make another point, and that is where you

6

have a prisoner serving a continuous period of confinement

7

under multiple convictions there is - - there's no real

8

incentive for a prisoner to delay bringing his habeas

claims.

10

Each day that passes is potentially another day

in unconstitutional confinement.
QUESTION:

11

Each day that --

Certainly the Court in Peyton used

QUESTION:

But do you take the position that

Peyton does not control?
MR. BOYLE:

I think, Justice Souter, the

21

principle of Peyton does control this case, the principle

22

being that a prisoner serving consecutive sentences is in

23

custody under each conviction supporting those sentences

24

throughout the aggregate duration of the confinement.

7

would make the availability of redress for constitutional

claims turn arbitrarily and capriciously on the order in

9

which those sentences are positioned in the commitment

11

that the order in which they are to be served makes no

12

difference for important penalogical events.

13

I'll mention a few of

The first is that the rule sought by Mississippi

QUESTION:

But I think you would have a hard

14

time justifying your characterization of that as

15

arbitrary, saying that you have to challenge a sentence

16

during the time in which you're serving it.

17

Now, your argument may be that the statute

18

permits that, which I understand, but I don't think

19

it's -- I think it's hard to say it's arbitrary if it

20

doesn't permit it, to simply say, you had a sentence for

21

3 years imposed upon you and you have to challenge it

22

during the time you're serving that sentence.

23

MR. BOYLE:

Our threshold position, Mr. Chief

24

Justice, is that each of the convictions supporting the

25

consecutive sentences poses a present restraint throughout

1

the duration of confinement, and in light of that I think

2

that permitting the availability of redress to turn on the

3

order in which the sentences appear in the commitment

4

order when that order makes no difference for purposes of

5

-- for penalogical purposes in Mississippi would, indeed,

6

be arbitrary.

7

Another effect of the rule sought by Mississippi

8

is that it would place prisoners' constitutional claims at

9

the mercy of the exhaustion process.

A prisoner who moved

10

diligently to exhaust his State remedies and that

11

exhaustion process for whatever reason did not conclude

12

prior to the technical expiration or the so-called

13

discharge date of the first consecutive sentence would be

14

foreclosed from habeas relief.

15

QUESTION:

Of course, that happens when a

16

prisoner hasn't gotten any more than the one sentence as

17

well.

18

serves more than 3 years for the habeas proceedings to be

19

completed, it's then too late to get any habeas relief.

20

He served his time, it's water over the dam, and he can't

21

challenge that conviction any more --

1

MR. BOYLE:

But the difference here, Your Honor,

2

is that the marijuana conviction will pose restraint on

3

Mr. Garlotte, will have custodial, real custodial effects

4

on Mr. Garlotte throughout the time he is confined in

5

Mississippi, an iron bar confinement, and in that

6

circumstance, I think it's unfair to leave those -- the

7

claims he may have against that conviction at the mercy of

8

the exhaustion process.

9

The final point, from a practical perspective,

10

is that it would - - the rule sought by Mississippi would

11

put courts in the sometimes confounding position of trying

12

to figure out -- trying to parse consecutive sentences and

13

trying to figure out when confinement ends under one and

14

begins under another.

15

where the technical discharge date of Mr. Garlotte's

16

marijuana conviction swung wildly from '88 to '86.

swing back again.

18

This case is a perfect example,

It may

There's no reason to take on that burden when

19

the State doesn't do so for purposes of administering its

20

penal system and when nothing of importance penalogically

21

turns on those technical discharge dates.

QUESTION:

It would be - -

How would this rule be applied in

States other than Mississippi?

Justice, and there may -- those variations may have

2

significance for purposes of the Federal question, but my

3

understanding of Mississippi's rules is that these are the

4

customary rules under which consecutive sentences are

5

administered, for good reason.
The State doesn't want to risk having a prisoner

6

7

paroled on the first conviction and sentence before he

8

begins to serve another conviction and sentence.

9

State doesn't want to put itself in the position of having

QUESTION:

5

MR. BOYLE:

Oh, I see.
So the State sees real advantages in

6

aggregating, amalgamating consecutive sentences and

7

treating them as a general sentence, and our submission is

8

that, given that election, Mississippi has to accept the

9

consequences that turn on long periods of confinement.
The State I don't think should be permitted to

11

resurrect artificial discharge dates as a means of closing

no meaning under the penal system.

basically to challenge this marijuana conviction for the

15

Because in Mississippi if you're sentenced to

life, you're sentenced to life, while even though you are

17

eligible for parole in 10 years and may get out of jail,

18

under Mississippi law you stay under a sentence of life

for the rest of your life, and therefore he would have

MR. WHITE:

QUESTION:

He's not going to be.
Right.

Now, what I wonder is --

Under the present --- after that day comes and goes,

7

then if he wanted to challenge that first sentence,

8

intuitively that seems much more like the case where a

9

person's been out for awhile, and at worst what happens is

10

that that earlier sentence is sort of taken into account

11

as an aggravating factor in his life that stops parole,

12

whereas before that 10 years and 10 months runs, it seems

13

much more like that that earlier sentence is having an

14

active effect at forcing him to be confined for an

15

additional 10 months.

16

Now, I don't know if there is a way conceptually

17

of taking that into account or not.

18

I'm wondering what your view is.

there's -- you know, there's a way to do that.

21

Of course,

I mean, even in the face of Rule 9 it's going to

22

create -- could create a tremendous work load on our

24

it's -- there's one thing to assert jurisdiction and say

you may have to answer the total thing and do an extensive

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN D. BOYLE

14

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Thank you, Mr. White.

15

MR. BOYLE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

16

I'd like to make just a couple of points.

17

First, on the question whether it would be possible to

18

parse consecutive sentences according to whether the

19

prisoner is marking time in those sentences, another

20

thought occurred to me, sitting down, and this is

21

amplified in the briefs.

22

In Mississippi, as I think in most States, the

23

sentences are really discharged in dovetail fashion, so

24

that when Mr. Garlotte's initial parole eligibility comes

25

around in March 1996, he will still have the balance of

his life terms to serve as well as a parole term on the

2

marijuana conviction.

3

either.

4

This is not idle imagination,

One of the cases we cite, Williams v. Puckett,

5

describes a situation where a prisoner who was on

6

probation committed a subsequent offense, was sentenced

7

upon that offense, and had his probation revoked.

8

9

The order in which the Department of Corrections
considered those sentences satisfied was first the

10

mandatory term on the revoked probation, second, the

11

minimum parole term on - - actually, it was a nonparolable

12

offense, armed robbery, that entire 10-year term next, and

13

finally the parole term on the original offense, so

14

it's -- they really are discharged in dovetail fashion.

15

Then also, in response to Justice Breyer's

16

question, which is an intriguing one, I think this case,

17

of course, illustrates the direct restraint that is posed

18

by Garlotte's marijuana conviction, but I think even

19

beyond the date of initial parole eligibility, like in the

20

year 15 or 20, the sentences still are treated as a

21

general sentence.

22

The earned time that he has on his marijuana

23

conviction is carried forward and can be forfeited at any

24

point, and if the marijuana conviction is invalidated, he

25

can get credit for that service on his life sentences,
