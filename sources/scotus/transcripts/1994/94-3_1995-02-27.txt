ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. RIEDEL

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. RIEDEL:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:

11

The general question that was before the Ohio

12

supreme court was, should a decision that establishes a

13

new rule of law apply to events that occurred before the

14

date of the decision?

15

The specific issue before the Ohio court was,

16

should the decision of this Court in Bendix v. Midwesco in

17

June of 1988, wherein Ohio's tolling statute, 2305.15, was

18

declared to be unconstitutional as being in violation of

19

the Commerce Clause, apply to time-bar the respondent's

20

lawsuit of August of 1987 for bodily injury arising out of

21

a motor vehicle accident that took place between the

22

parties in March of 1984, and at all times before and

23

after this accident, Ohio had, continues to have, a 2-

24

year statute of limitations for the filing of personal

25

injury actions.

QUESTION:

The accident took place where, in

Ashtabula County in Ohio?

3

MR. RIEDEL:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. RIEDEL:

It did, Your Honor.
The parties were Pennsylvanians?
Everybody.

The petitioners, the

6

corporation and its driver were residents of Pennsylvania.

7

The respondent likewise was a resident of Pennsylvania.

8

9

Although the Ohio trial court and a court of
appeals both answered the specific issue in the

10

affirmative -- in other words, Bendix applies

11

retroactively to the parties and the respondent's lawsuit

12

was time-barred -- when the question was presented to the

13

Ohio supreme court, it reversed the decisions of the lower

14

court and stated that Bendix should not be retroactively

15

applied to the parties in this case.

16

unanimous decision.

17

It was not a

It was 5-2.

The rationale of the Ohio supreme court, the

18

majority, for denying the retroactive application of

19

Bendix, was essentially twofold, and it appeared in

20

Parts I and Part II of the majority's opinion.

21

In Part II of the majority's opinion, the court

22

placed its reasoning on this Court's decision in Harper v.

23

Virginia, and that is clear because the majority stated,

24

even if the Chevron case test has been replaced by Harper,

25

the retroactive application of Bendix remains

impermissible.
QUESTION:

2
3

Well, how do you overcome Harper,

Mr. Riedel?

4

MR. RIEDEL:

I overcome Harper by virtue of the

5

constitutional issue.

The violation in Harper was a real

6

violation.

There is no constitutional -QUESTION:

7

So you think there was no

8

constitutional violation here or in Bendix?

9

was not unconstitutional?
MR. RIEDEL:

QUESTION:

It is, but not in this case.

In Bendix,

The statute

Yes.

about --

QUESTION:

MR. RIEDEL:

-- was unconstitutional.
Exactly.

The supreme court of Ohio

23

recognized the unconstitutionality of that statute in this

24

case.

in that

sense.
QUESTION:

2

3

I thought Harper had indicated that

backward-looking relief is required.
MR. RIEDEL:

4

Backward-looking relief for

5

underlying constitutional violation.

6

there was an underlying constitutional violation in this

7

case.
The majority went on to state that Harper allows

determine.

confused here.

You're not running away from Harper.

14

MR. RIEDEL:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. RIEDEL:

Yes.
Yes.

1

decision may not be retroactively applied to bar claims

2

which accrued prior to the announcement of that decision.

3

That's the holding of the court, and that's al that

4

counts.

5

MR. RIEDEL:

That is true, Justice Ginsburg, and

6

what the majority went on to state was that Harper, their

7

reading of Harper, allowed State courts to tailor their

8

own remedy as they determine the manner in which a United

9

States Supreme Court opinion was to be retroactively

10
11

applied.
And what the majority's manner of tailoring in

12

this case was, was to employ a provision of the Ohio

13

constitution, Article I, section 16, and state that that

14

prohibited the application of Bendix to the parties in

15

this case, and specifically with regard to Article I and

16

section 16, the majority stated, "We find that when there

17

is a conflict between a State constitutional civil right,

18

Article I, section 16, and a Federal rule of decision, the

19

Bendix case, that is not rooted in the Constitution, such

20

as retroactivity, the civil right prevails."

21

The rationale of the majority, in Part II of its

22

decision, in denying full retroactivity to the parties in

23

this case, is wrong, and that's been, I believe, so

24

conceded by the respondent in this case.

25

QUESTION:

They state --

Suppose Chevron Oil, where there's

still some vitality left to it.

2

we uphold the Ohio decision?

3

MR. RIEDEL:

In that case, shouldn't

No, and I'd like to talk about that

4

a little later, Justice Ginsburg, as to why, if Chevron is

5

in fact applied, that even if it is applied, it would not

6

achieve the result that the majority found in this case.

7

The respondent has conceded with the

8

petitioners, we agree, that the clear command of the

9

Supremacy Clause of the Constitution displaces all

10

conflicting State's law.

11

case to support the denial of full retroactivity of the

12

Bendix decision is the logic of Part I of the majority's

13

opinion, and whereas in Part II was premised upon the

14

majority's reading of Harper, in Part I the court denied

15

retroactivity by resort to a Chevron analysis, and again,

16

that's clear because the court said,

17

good law, then Chevron, not Harper, provides the proper

18

test to apply to the present case."

19

What is left, therefore, in this

"If Chevron remains

Without quite saying so, I would submit that the

20

majority had its doubts regarding the continued viability

21

of a Chevron analysis.

22

the majority's opinion that it is unclear whether Harper

23

was intended to replace Chevron or supplement it:

24

Chevron remains good law, even if Chevron has been

25

replaced by Harper, whether or not Chevron remains good

That's evidenced by statements in

if

1

law.

Despite what I believe were legitimate

2

3

reservations about Chevron, the court nevertheless went

4

ahead and did a Chevron analysis, and although the

5

majority did not so state, I would submit that its resort

6

to Chevron was solely in the context of a choice of law

7

analysis.

8

9

In other words, the new law or the old law.
The issue of remedy, the second prong of the

court's opinion, was discussed in Part II.

In other

10

words, when the court went on to say, Harper allows the

11

courts to tailor their own remedy.

12

Part I of the opinion, its Chevron inquiry, the

13

term "remedy" was never mentioned by the majority.

14

never used the term, because I would submit the court

15

viewed Chevron as a vehicle for determining choice of law.

16

Again, old law, resort to the continued use of the tolling

17

statute, or new law, Bendix, 2305.15 is unconstitutional.

18

QUESTION:

It

Mr. Riedel, is there any choice of

19

remedies in this cas, or is the choice simply between a

20

remedy and no remedy?

21

MR. RIEDEL:

In this case, in my opinion,

22

Justice Souter, there is no issue as to remedies.

23

believe it is a matter of application of the old law or

24

the new law.

QUESTION:

Is it clear that we have old law and

Bendix at least is that it relied on established legal

principles, so it's not a change of law.

law and old law, and that is a way to distinguish Chevron.

6

I thought that perhaps one reading of

MR. RIEDEL:

There's not new

Well, in terms of courts that must

7

follow this Court's decision, this Court's decision --

8

this Court in 1988 said in Bendix that that statute was

9

unconstitutional.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. RIEDEL:

Under settled legal principles.
Correct, and between 1988 and when

12

the Ohio supreme court decided this case in February of

13

1994, those principles had not changed.

14

QUESTION:

So you could just --

15

QUESTION:

And that is my point, and I think --

16
17
18
19

isn't that a distinction between this case and Chevron?
MR. RIEDEL:

No, I don't, sir.

I don't think

that is a distinction.
QUESTION:

Couldn't you just as readily, then,

20

answer my question by saying the choice is between

21

applying Bendix and not applying Bendix, those are the

22

only two choices?

MR. RIEDEL:

QUESTION:

MR. RIEDEL:

Yes.
Okay.
Yes.

QUESTION:

But haven't -- under the Chevron-

2

type approach, haven't we said, if the rule is clearly

3

foreshadowed, it's not a new rule?

4

certainly an argument that could be made here, even if

5

Chevron remained.

6

MR. RIEDEL:

I mean, that is

That is true, and even if the

7

court -- I don't believe that the Ohio court looked at

8

Chevron in a remedial sense as you are talking about, but

9

rather, a choice of law, but if --

10

QUESTION:

Well, can we talk --

11

MR. RIEDEL:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. RIEDEL:

Sure.
-- about it here?
Sure.

Even if you did it in a

14

remedial sense, what occurred, in terms of, I think, a

15

time frame in this case is significant to look at.

16

This accident between the parties occurred in

17

March of 1984.

18

District Court for the Northern District of Ohio in Copley

19

v. Heil-Quaker ruled this particular statute as being

20

unconstitutional.

21

of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Bendix v. Midwesco, in

22

a unanimous opinion, this statute is unconstitutional.

QUESTION:

1

So that when the lawsuit was filed,

2

the doubt about the validity of this statute was

established under clearly settled principles --

QUESTION:

That it would not --- but that's different than Chevron,

and that's a way of distinguishing this case and Chevron,

That the -- the statute was clearly

MR. RIEDEL:

You don't want to

Well, certainly, you know, the

clear past precedent, or deciding an issue of first

The lawsuit had not been filed.

1

On a less profound level, Mr. Riedel,

2

was it just coincidence that both the vehicles involved in

3

this case were from Pennsylvania?

4

QUESTION:

I believe so.
Any reason to know why the suit was

brought in Ohio rather than Pennsylvania?

MR. RIEDEL:

9

QUESTION:

I do not know.

I think that would

Could it have something to do with

10

the statute of limitations and the tolling that would be

11

possible under the old law in Ohio and not in

12

Pennsylvania?

13
14

MR. RIEDEL:

QUESTION:

Do you know what the statute of

limitations would have been in Pennsylvania?

17

MR. RIEDEL:

18

QUESTION:

I think it is the same as Ohio.
And that's where under any theory the

19

defendant always was, because the defendant is from

20

Pennsylvania.
MR. RIEDEL:

21

Everybody was from Pennsylvania,

and so I believe the statute was likewise 2 years in

MR. RIEDEL:

That's correct, and so to address

what you had asked me earlier about, if Chevron -- the

Chevron test were applied to this case, which the majority

6

attempted to do, or at least they said they were going to

do in Part I of the opinion, clearly, they didn't even

8

address the first issue in Chevron, the clear precedent or

9

the foreshadowing argument, because what the Ohio majority

10

said was, Bendix was the first time that any court of

11

binding authority in Ohio State courts had ruled the

12

tolling statute unconstitutional.

13

That's not the test from Chevron.

The test from

14

Chevron, at least the threshold, the first test, is clear

15

past precedent or no clear foreshadowing.

there was a lack of clear past precedent, the district

And what was the date of that case?
That was, I believe,

area.

it down at that point, but it addressed -- it addressed

the issue of a similar tolling statute in New Jersey under

MR. DYK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
We, of course, do not take issue with the Harper

6

decision on the choice-of-law issue, and I should make

7

clear that in the oral argument before the Ohio supreme

8

court, which came after the Harper decision, Mr. Eardley

9

and Mr. Zulandt did not argue that the Ohio supreme court

10

had any discretion with respect to the choice-of-law

11

aspect of Harper.

12

We agreed then, we agree now, that the Ohio

13

supreme court had no choice with respect to the choice-

14

of-law issue, and that the first part of its decision

15

suggesting otherwise is wrong.

Article I section 16 of the Ohio constitution, the right

22

part of the opinion, because what they suggested there was

2

that the Ohio constitution trumps this Court's choice of

law rules even if they apply to remedies, but I think what

4

the Ohio supreme court really meant to say, or at least

5

should have said, was that the remedial provisions in the

Ohio constitution were consistent with Federal law, were

7

consistent with the Harper case, and we believe that they

were, in fact, consistent with the Harper case.

Harper, of course, did not preclude States from

What he finds is a New

Now, the difference between the two is

significant, because under the New Jersey statute, when

you registered you became liable to taxation in the State.

14

The Ohio statute imposed no such requirement, and this

Court in Searle suggested strongly at the end of its

opinion that there was a critical difference between a

MR. DYK:

But the harmless error doctrine in a

10

State court, in a State case, originates as a matter of

11

State law, and the question is, is it consistent with this

12

Court's rules.

The same thing is suggested --

QUESTION:

13

But even in that instance, Mr. Dyk,

14

the very premise of applying harmless error is that there

15

is nothing that requires a remedy, i.e., a mistake was

16

harmless.

17

Nothing need to be corrected.
Here, you are looking at a prospective

18

application of a constitutional standard, and you are

19

going in effect to deny this person the benefit of a

20

constitutional rule.

21

Those cases aren't comparable.

22

MR. DYK:

Justice Souter, I take the example of

But those were cases at least, as I

was saying about habeas, in which somebody had a shot at

raising the issue, and you know,we can argue and give an

instance as to whether the person was at fault or

8

negligent, or what-not, for not raising the issue and

10

choice here.

This is the only time, the only case in

11

which this issue can be raised.
MR. DYK:

12

Justice Souter,

I don't agree with

13

that.

I think that this issue could have been raised, at

14

least in theory, by Reynoldsville Casket, for example,

15

bringing a declaratory judgment after the accident to have

16

this provision of the Ohio statutes declared

17

unconstitutional, and they --

18

QUESTION:

You want them to go in and invite the

19

lawsuit in order to get the benefit of a constitutional

20

remedy?

21

MR. DYK:

I'm merely suggesting that there is a

22

remedy here, that it's not a situation in which there is

23

no remedy available.

24
25

The traditional remedy, of course, is to raise
it as a defense.

But for what it's worth, that still

doesn't put them on par with the individual who has

Well, I think that Ohio is entitled to

make the choice, as it does routinely and across the

It is not discriminating against the Federal

right.

It is simply deciding a remedial issue.

MR. DYK:

Well, I do think the label reflects

real substance underlying the Ohio rule of decision.
There is a huge difference, both as a practical

matter and in theory between saying as a choice-of-law

15

I asked a question of Mr. Warren, is it isn't what --

16

under Ohio's own law what counts is the syllabus, and

17

under the syllabus, section 16 of Article I of the Ohio

18

constitution -- under that provision, recent U.S. Supreme

Court decisions may not be retroactively applied to bar

provision.
They are relying on a right to a remedy

provision, mistakenly saying that that trumps this Court's

4

rules about retroactivity, but I think it is nonetheless

5

clear what they are saying, even though they should have

said it differently:

that there is a right to a remedy

As this Court has frequently held in past cases

8

involving State law, all sorts of law, where you are
10

surprised you get the benefit of tolling of the statute of

11

limitations, and we don't think that that's an exceptional

12

thing, and it has been done at least twice by this Court

13

in St. Francis and Chevron, and in Glaus, for example --

14

QUESTION:

Well, however, you recast the

15

decision, correct me if I'm wrong, I thought it was the

1

we urged on them -- we did not urge to the contrary.

2

we urged on them was that the Ohio constitution, the right

3

to a remedy provision, was consistent with Federal law,

4

and that they could, at one and the same time, recognize

5

that they were bound by the Bendix decision, but take

6

account of the surprise factor by applying this right to a

7

remedy, this provision of the Ohio constitution.
QUESTION:

8

9

What

I suppose there's no reason why such

a provision, if it's operative against Federal decisions,

10

couldn't be applied to substantive matters as well.

11

is, if there is a surprise ruling by this Court that a

12

particular substantive provision of Ohio law is

13

unconstitutional, the Ohio court could say, well, you

14

know, that's a surprise, and we're going to preserve

15

expectations by not applying that retroactively.

MR. DYK:

I would have a serious question about

that, Justice Scalia.

QUESTION:

Why?

Why is that different from

this?
MR. DYK:

Well, first of all, if a decision of

21

this Court says that a Federal right does not exist, Ohio

22

could not continue to apply --

23

QUESTION:

Not a Federal right doesn't exist,

24

that the State -- the State substantive provision is

25

unconstitutional, under which a plaintiff was suing.

MR. DYK:

1

And you would have to inquire, under

2

those circumstances, whether the reasons that Ohio gave

3

for preserving the State substantive provision were

4

legitimate or illegitimate, and probably in most cases

5

they wouldn't be legitimate.

they were genuinely protecting expectations, I guess you'd

we're not really talking about remedy, but we're talking

about whether or not we will allow another constitutional

violation to take place?

MR. DYK:

independent constitutional violation, and it is not, we

suggest, a violation of the Commerce Clause, it is a
