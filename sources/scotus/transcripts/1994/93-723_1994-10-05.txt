ORAL ARGUMENT OF DREW S. DAYS, III

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

GENERAL DAYS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
At issue in this case is the constitutionality

11
12

of section 2252 of the Child Protection Act of 1984 as

13

amended.

14

shipping, receiving, or distributing in interstate or

15

foreign commerce or mails any visual depiction if the

16

producing of that depiction involves the use of a minor

17

engaging in sexually explicit conduct and the visual

18

depiction is of such conduct.

19

set out at section 3a of the appendix to our opening

20

brief.

That section prohibits knowingly transporting,

The text of section 2252 is

21

The Ninth Circuit held the statute

22

unconstitutional on its face under the First Amendment

23

because it held that the statute did not require an

24

element of the offense be that the defendant knew the

25

minority status of at least one of the performers engaging

1

in sexually explicit conduct, but rather, according to the

2

court, imposed strict liability.

3

respondent's convictions under section 2252 were reversed.

4

As a consequence,

We submit that the court of appeals committed

5

error in this respect, because 2252 does require that the

6

defendant know that at least one performer in the visual

7

depiction is a minor.

8

reverse and remand the case for further proceedings

9

consistent with that proper reading of the statute.
QUESTION:

10

Consequently, we urge this Court to

General Days, the Government I would

11

think could also have argued that the Ninth Circuit was

12

wrong because no such scienter requirement was required by

13

the Constitution.

14

GENERAL DAYS:

Your Honor, we're not here to

15

argue whether there was in fact an unconstitutionality

16

presented in this case, but merely that there was a

17

constitutional problem.

18

discuss whether the statute would be constitutional

19

without a scienter requirement -- that is, as a strict

20

liability statute -- but that's not presented by this

21

case.

22

QUESTION:

23

GENERAL DAYS:

Perhaps at another time one could

Why not?
Well, because Federal courts are

24

required, according to principles of interpretation, to

25

try to avoid constitutional problems unless it would be

clearly contrary to the intent of Congress.
QUESTION:

But what if a majority of the Court

3

were to conclude that fairly reading the statute there was

4

no such scienter requirement?

5
6

7

GENERAL DAYS:

Well, if this Court was to so

decide, that would conclude the matter.
QUESTION:

Why?

We don't take our law by

8

stipulation of the parties.

9

say that there is no constitutional requirement.

10

GENERAL DAYS:

11

QUESTION:

12

GENERAL DAYS:

We would be perfectly free to

That's what I'm suggesting.

Oh.
If the Court were to decide that,

13

that certainly would resolve the matter, but our concern

14

with the Ninth Circuit opinion is that it made no effort,

15

according to the dictates of this Court's decisions, to

16

try to avoid the constitutional problem.

17

It's certainly, as we understand it, not the

18

duty of Federal courts to try to seek out a constitutional

19

problem and resolve it if it's not presented, and we think

20

that particular problem in the way the Ninth Circuit

21

handled this case and its failure to recognize that

22

normally scienter is presumed to be part of a statute even

23

when there's no scienter requirement on the face of the

24

statute, the Ninth Circuit's failure to use those two

25

principles of construction, namely avoiding constitutional

1

interpretation, and 2) reading this background assumption

2

of the criminal law, namely, scienter, into the statute,

3

caused it to commit error.

4

QUESTION:

Well, General Days, the most natural

5

reading of the statute may be that which the Ninth Circuit

6

adopted.

7

be the most natural reading, isn't that correct?

8

The language is set off by commas, and it might

GENERAL DAYS:

Perhaps so, Justice O'Connor.

There are many readings that have been offered in
10

connection with the statute, indeed, in this litigation.

11

The Ninth Circuit held that knowingly went just to

12

transporting and distributing and so forth, and didn't

13

reach visual depictions.

14

QUESTION:

15

GENERAL DAYS:

Because that's how it is set out.
Well, visual depiction actually

16

is before the if clause, the dependent clause, and yet the

17

Ninth Circuit held that that wasn't encompassed, and then

18

we have the amicus, the linguists who say that it goes

1

down to include visual depiction, and apparently the

20

respondents take that view.

21

It seems to me that it is also possible, because

22

it's not clear from the statute how far knowingly travels

23

down the paragraph, that it could include the entire

24

provision, and besides, even if this --

Well, what do we normally do if we

1

think the language is clear?
GENERAL DAYS:

2

Well, you go with the language as

3

it's set out in the statute, but I think courts do that

4

only when doing so would not present constitutional

5

problems, and although a natural reading of the statute is

6

one way that the courts can approach this issue, I think

7

this Court has held that in some cases, particularly in

8

criminal cases, the most plausible reading of the statute

9

is not the one that the Court should adopt because of

10

constitutional problems.
QUESTION:

11

Judge Kozinski in the opinion below

12

thought that you couldn't read knowingly into it, but what

13

the court should do is to import a recklessness

14

requirement for the age.

15

GENERAL DAYS:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

Yes, he did say that.

I don't --

What is your position on the Kozinski

view?
GENERAL DAYS:

Our position is that it is not

19

necessary for the Court to do that for several reasons.

20

1) Knowingly is in the statute, so it suggests something

21

about Congress' regard for that level of scienter, and the

22

Model Penal Code suggests that where a level of scienter

23

is stated in a statute, it's appropriate to read that

24

level of scienter throughout the entire statute unless

25

there's something clearly to the contrary that would

suggest otherwise.
We also think that knowingly is consistent with

2

3

what Congress had in mind.

4

history, if there's any lesson that one can draw from the

5

legislative history, it is that Congress wanted scienter

6

in the statute, that it was not thinking in terms of

7

strict liability.
QUESTION:

obscene before visual depiction.
GENERAL DAYS:

That's correct.

That particular

statute is set out at 3-1 of our brief.

14

As I understand it, General Days,

when the statute was enacted in 1978, it had the word

12

Looking at the legislative

QUESTION:

At that point, do you think that the

knowledge requirement applied to subsections (a) and (b)?
GENERAL DAYS:

15

Given the history of the statute,

16

the legislative history, there are two possible readings,

17

at least.

18

minority statutes of a performer, but there is another

19

reading.

20

Congress might have had in mind that the scienter attached

21

to obscenity violations would suffice to comply with any

22

constitutional requirements.

23

One is that knowingly continued to apply to the

Since obscenity was added to the statute,

When we're talking about this earlier

version, was this an earlier version that was approved by

25

the whole Congress?

GENERAL DAYS:

2

QUESTION:

3

The earlier version?

Yes, that had obscene visual

depiction?
GENERAL DAYS:

4

Oh, yes.

That became the statute

5

in 1978.

It was a statute that did not have minority

6

status as an element, as such, of the offense.

7

had was minority status as a penalty-enhancing provision,

8

and it was not until 1984, after this Court's decision in

9

Ferber, that obscenity was dropped, and what happened then

10

was that minority status became the element that

11

distinguished between legal and illegal conduct.

What it

12

It became the boundary between legal conduct,

13

namely the possession of nonobscene material on the one

14

hand, which is protected by this Court's decisions and by

15

the First Amendment, and illegal material following

16

Ferber, which would be nonobscene, pornographic material

17

involving minors as performers.

18

QUESTION:

But it is odd that the deletion of

19

one word would imply the inclusion of two other unstated

20

words.
GENERAL DAYS:

Well, I mean, if you assume that with

6

Knowingly never dropped out, and the

Well, that's certainly one

assumption.

7

QUESTION:

-- it would be rather odd to say that

8

this is an implied extension by the deletion of the word

9

obscene.

10

GENERAL DAYS:

Your Honor, certainly that is a

11

difficulty with that particular reading, but not

12

inconsistent with the legislative history, and the fact

13

that knowingly was retained throughout this process I

14

think is instructive, because if one looks at a companion

15

provision to 2252, namely 2251, which has to do with the

16

production of child pornography, the history shows that

17

Congress in 1978 dropped the term knowingly, intending,

18

based upon advice that it received from the Department of

19

Justice, that that was not necessary because it would be a

20

situation where appropriately a producer should be given

21

the burden of determining whether the performer was in

22

fact a minor, and would suffer the consequences if he or

23

she failed in that regard.

2

GENERAL DAYS:

3

QUESTION:

Yes.

Was changed to make penalty an

4

element of an offense.

5

insufficient for failure to allege an essential element of

6

the offense, because minority status was not alleged in

7

the indictment?

8

9

Why, then, wasn't this indictment

GENERAL DAYS:

Well, that's a very good

question, Justice Ginsburg.

Let me say first that the

10

lower courts have -- the court of appeals did not address

11

the sufficiency of the indictment issue, but on that very

12

point, Russell v. United States seems to suggest, although

13

we are not reading it in this way, that where a court

14

imposes an element that was not on the face of the

15

statute, then the indictment is insufficient if it does

16

not have that element set out in terms.

17

But one can read Russell v. United States and

18

subsequent cases to hold that the issue is where an

19

element of fact is supplied, in fact, by a decision of the

20

court, that the indictment that lacks that particular

21

information is deficient.

22

In Russell, it had to do with contempt of

23

Congress, and the question was, did the indictment

24

adequately notify the defendant that pertinent questions

25

had to be answered, questions pertinent to the subject of

1

the inquiry, and what this Court said was, it is not

2

sufficient in the indictment to simply follow the statute,

3

the terms of the statute, track the statute, because the

4

subject of the inquiry is not clear, and therefore the

5

indictment has to provide the defendant with more notice.

6

But we think here, we have the term knowingly,

7

and if this Court determines that knowingly in fact

8

reaches the minority status of the performer, I don't

9

believe that there would be a problem with the indictment,

10

but as I said initially, this is something that the court

11

of appeals perhaps is in the best position to sort out,

12

and it was not presented to this Court for determination.

13

QUESTION:

So your first answer is that

14

knowingly travels down the indictment just as you urge it

15

travels down the statute.

16

GENERAL DAYS:

17

QUESTION:

That's correct.

May I ask you, General Days, on the

18

basic argument that you're making that we should avoid the

19

constitutional issue by construing the statute to include

20

this knowing requirement, would you not make precisely the

21

same argument if the word knowingly were not in the

22

statute, given our decision last year in the Staples case

23

holding that even though the word knowingly wasn't in the

24

gun statute, the Court thought there was a presumption

25

that the criminal must be proven to have known the facts

standard.

Standard.

QUESTION:

Well, why should this one be a

recklessness standard?
GENERAL DAYS:

Well, our position is that

5

knowingly is the appropriate standard, although we cannot

6

ignore the fact that this Court in Osborne was confronted

7

with a case where there was no scienter on the face of the

8

statute, and this Court accepted the Ohio supreme court's

9

decision to invoke a provision, a statutory provision that

10

made recklessness the default standard, so that's on the

11

books, and we have indicated in our brief that we think

12

knowingly is more consistent with the legislative history,

13

and I would assume - -

14

QUESTION:

General Days, that's a reasonable

15

thing to do, to import knowingly, or recklessly, or

16

whatever, where the legislator has not explicitly

17

addressed the subject.

18

But you're dealing here with a statute in which

19

the legislator has explicitly addressed it and I, frankly,

20

I don't know how it could have been made any clearer that

21

the portion of the statute coming after the word if is not

22

subject to the knowingly -- I've asked myself several

23

times, you know, how would I have put it if I had wanted

24

to make clear that the knowingly only goes to shipping in

25

interstate commerce any visual depiction.

Yes, I would agree with you if it

upon the legislative history and based upon the various

readings that people who have looked at the statute have

I think that

odd placement when there is this very significant issue,

But even without the Ferber

GENERAL DAYS:

QUESTION:

I would agree.

I mean, presumably Congress has a

serious purpose, and they must have been serious about the

subject of the depiction, and the knowledge of minority

status.

that this material would be constitutionally protected if

The second thing is, well, you had to know they

scienter requirement in the cases that I'm aware of has

looked at knowingly at the standard, and not something

less than that, but it is the case that at least under the

Hamling or Smith, if you knew the nature and character of

GENERAL DAYS:

We're not denying that that's a

I'm here saying it's unconstitutional.

But we've also not simply gone to

recklessly, knowingly, even where it's not written in the

statute.

13

We did that last year.
MR. FLEISHMAN:

Sure you did it last -- but the

14

rule that came out of the Staples case is that's only done

15

when Congress has not manifested a contrary intent.

this case, Congress has manifested a contrary intent both

17

in the text of the statute and in the legislative history.

to minority requirement in it, if that's true, and if it's

true that 2251 does not have a scienter requirement in it,

Suppose that you did think that the

strict liability as to the age of the person depicted --

MR. FLEISHMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

Suppose, for example, you thought a

8

lot of people who were going to ship material that they

9

had a constitutional right to ship, say of adults --

MR. FLEISHMAN:

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

-- or works of art, or whatever, some

12

not works of art, but regardless, they had a

13

constitutional right, would have to err on the safe side,

14

and therefore they would have to refrain from shipping

15

material that they had a constitutional right to ship.

16

MR. FLEISHMAN:

17

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Suppose you believed that, but you

18

thought the statute might be saved by importing a scienter

19

either of recklessly or of knowingly.

20

decide which of those two would be the appropriate

21

scienter requirement for this statute?
•MR. FLEISHMAN:

22

How would you

I would say neither, and I would

23

say that the requirement should be specific intent,

24

specific intent something like what you have in the Cheek

case.

what's involved, in terms of what the meaning of the

2

statute is, at the very least a person ought to know that

he's committing a crime.

4

There's just -- the ambiguity with regard to the

5

minority aside for the moment, there are a lot of other

6

problems in here where a person can be a perfectly

7

innocent, law-abiding citizen and be trapped into this

8

broad law, so if you're going to try and save it at all, I

9

would say that it has to have specific intent.

10

Your Honors did that, as the Chief pointed out

11

earlier, in the case that you wrote, Justice Ginsburg,

12

with regard to the Nevada case where there was specific

13

intent with regard to the money-laundering.

14

specific intent there read in, it would seem to me it's

15

more appropriate to read a specific intent into a statute,

16

a criminal statute of this type of severity where the

17

First Amendment's interests are so strongly at play.

were a number of constructions possible, and the

MR. FLEISHMAN:

-- and I'm saying it's a good

model, and I think we ought to use that model now in terms

of interpreting this statute if the Court wants to

interpret it, but I do believe that this is a case where

the Court should not interpret it.
