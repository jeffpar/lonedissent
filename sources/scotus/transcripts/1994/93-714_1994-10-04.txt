ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRADFORD ANDERSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. ANDERSON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This is a case which contains within the

11

question presented, as set forth in the Court's March 28th

12

order, a much more narrowly-focused question, and that

13

question is whether the decision below should be vacated

14

when after this Court granted certiorari the parties

15

settled and mooted the case before this Court, and that

16

settlement did not contain any agreement or condition

17

requiring, or for that matter precluding vacatur.

18

We also contend for a rule - - a more general

19

application, and that is that the established precedent

20

confirmed in the Munsingwear decision and in later

21

decisions of this Court which require vacatur upon

22

mootness, that those decisions be generally adhered to in

23

cases where mootness arises as a result of settlement.

24
25

And because that is the established practice of
this Court, we believe that the burden should be on the

1

respondent, Bonner, to demonstrate why that practice

2

should be changed.
Our position here can be summarized rather

3
4

succinctly:

1)

in a case like this one, where the Court

5

has granted review so that the decision below is not final

6

in the Federal statutory scheme and therefore there is no

7

presumption of correctness, we believe, which attaches,

8

vacatur is appropriate generally and in this specific

9

case.
QUESTION:

10

Mr. Anderson, when you say vacatur,

11

are you referring just to the judgment below, or are you

12

referring also to the opinion, if there was an opinion

13

below?

14
15

MR. ANDERSON:

We are referring to what in

essence is the judgment below.

16

We do not contend, as has been suggested by

17

Bonner, that the opinion should be somehow expunged from

18

published sources, or that it should be depublished or

19

withdrawn.

20

essence is the judgment below.

21

What we are addressing is the -- what in

QUESTION:

And you would leave it to some other

22

rule or set of rules to decide whether the opinion should

23

continue to have precedential value in the circuit, and

24

that sort of thing?

MR. ANDERSON:

That's correct, Mr. Chief

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

Mr. Anderson, may I ask you --

What would a circuit court judge do

if there were an opinion and the judgment had been vacated

and that opinion is on the book?

MR. ANDERSON:

Is that the law of the

I don't believe it would be the

law of the circuit, Your Honor.

The -- our position is,

and I think it's consistent -QUESTION:

So it's just like an interesting law

12

review article hanging out there?

13

MR. ANDERSON:

No, Your Honor.

I think that it

14

would be not comparable to a law review, but perhaps

15

comparable to the decisions that we have found in the

16

Seventh Circuit on this same new value exception issue,

17

where there has been much learned discussion about the

18

issue, most of it -- I guess all of it in dicta, and it

19

has provided, I think, a useful examination of the issue

20

which then ultimately goes to establish the basis for what

21

ultimately will become the precedent.

22

QUESTION:

Now, you've confused me.

I thought

23

you just told the Chief Justice you didn't care, that you

24

would leave that to, you know, for another day.

25

MR. ANDERSON:

We do care.

opposite to me a moment ago.

You said the vacatur would

I'm sorry, Your Honor, I must

11

have misinterpreted your question.

our argument here today that a determination be made as to

13

what the precedential effect, if any, of vacatur is.

QUESTION:

It is not necessary to

Is there any reason why, say, the

15

Ninth Circuit couldn't -- consistent with your position

16

why the Ninth Circuit couldn't have a rule that said, even

17

though a judgment of our court which has been vacated

pursuant to Munsingwear, nonetheless we will continue to

regard our opinion in that case as a circuit precedent?

You cite

1

grounds, and that seems to be considered proper authority

2

so long as the vacatur is not for the reason cited.
MR. ANDERSON:

3

I believe that could be the case,

4

Justice Scalia.

5

generally is that, our understanding of the law is that

6

normally a vacated decision would not have precedential or

7

binding effect on the lower courts.
QUESTION:

8

9

I was simply stating that our position

Mr. Anderson, may I ask you a

preliminary question about Munsingwear?
Do you think we should read Munsingwear as a

10
11

case in which the mootness was the result of happenstance,

12

which was the word used in the opinion, or should we read

13

that as a case in which the mootness or the underlying

14

mootness resulted from the acts, the unilateral act of one

15

party, and hence creating the mootness?

16

MR. ANDERSON:

We would contend, Your Honor,

17

that the mootness to the extent it was created there, was

18

created by the unilateral act, and that the reference to

19

happenstance by the court in Munsingwear was not a

20

description of what had happened, but was rather more of

21

an off-hand reference to - QUESTION:

22

23
24
25

A misdescription of what had

happened?
MR. ANDERSON:

Possibly a misdescription of what

had happened, yes, Your Honor.

In fact, as you know,

1

Munsingwear did not involve directly the question of

2

mootness.

3

whether res judicata effect should have been given to the

4

judgment, which the United States did not challenge

5

directly below.

The question before the Court in that case was

6

The Court indicated also that, had the United

7

States moved to vacate in the court of appeals, that it

8

would have been entitled to that relief.

9

QUESTION:

Do you think it's fair to say that

10

the court in Munsingwear did not view it the way you have

11

just described it?

12

happenstance, and happenstance alone, if it viewed it your

13

way?

14

What was the point of talking about

MR. ANDERSON:

Well, the explanation, Your

15

Honor, I think is reflected in the subsequent decisions of

16

this Court after Munsingwear was decided.

17

least a dozen decisions in which, with Munsingwear

18

standing there as precedent, this Court has granted

19

vacatur in cases where mootness came about as a result

of

QUESTION:

There are at

Well, yes, but we're now in effect

22

saying, should we be doing that.

Your position is

23

stronger if we view it as a case in which the mootness

24

resulted from the unilateral act of a party.

agree there, I take it?

You would

1

MR. ANDERSON:

2

QUESTION:

Yes, that is correct.

May I just ask -- you see, I'm not

3

sure your argument tracks your position in your briefs --

4

is it your position that there should, we should announce

5

a general rule that when there's a settlement there will

6

always be a vacation of the judgment below, or is it to be

7

decided on a case-by-case determination?

8

9

MR. ANDERSON:

Ultimately, as we have argued in

our briefs, the decision whether to vacate is bottomed on

10

discretion by this Court.

11

appropriately exercised as a general matter in cases where

12

mootness occurs as a result of the joint action of the

13

parties in agreeing to a settlement where the prevailing

14

party below agrees to - -

15

QUESTION:

We believe that discretion is

I'm still a little puzzled as to what

16

you're saying.

The discretion should be exercised as a

17

general matter to vacate, but does that mean that we

18

should adopt a rule we should always vacate without

19

looking at the particular facts, or are we simply -- I

20

don't quite understand.

21

MR. ANDERSON:

Well, there may be circumstances,

22

Justice Stevens, where the Court would have to look at the

23

particular facts.

24

unusual and perhaps extraordinary.

25

I think those circumstances would be
For example, where you

1

the parties can identify a pattern of abusive settlements,

2

but the general rule - -

3

QUESTION:

Why would that make any difference?

4

MR. ANDERSON:

Because ultimately vacatur is

5

premised on the exercise of discretion by this Court, and

6

the interests promoted by vacatur, which are fairness and

7

the prudential considerations that we have outlined, would

8

not be promoted, I don't think, in a situation where the

9

settlement was in fact not a settlement.

For example,

10

where the losing party below essentially pays the full

11

amount of the judgment.
In essence, what it's saying there is that it is

12

13

prepared to live with the judgment, it is prepared to

14

comply with the decision below, and in that circumstance,

15

where the prevailing party below has not made any

16

concessions, has not agreed to forego reliance on that

17

lower court decision --

18

QUESTION:

No, but it's willing to pay in the

19

particular case, but it still doesn't like the general

20

rule that the court announced, and that's -- that -- I

21

really don't understand your position, but go ahead.

22

QUESTION:

May I ask you to clarify your

23

position that you care only about having the judgment

24

expunged?

25

hurt is either the preclusive effect or the precedential

The judgment doesn't do anything.

What can

value, so what does it mean to vacate a judgment if that

2

judgment is still going to have, if the opinion is going

3

to have precedential value?

4

vacating the bare bottom line if everything else is

5

retained?
MR. ANDERSON:

6

What do you accomplish by

Well, Your Honor, in this

7

instance, as the Court said in Munsingwear, one of the

8

purposes of vacatur is to prevent the spawning of any

9

legal consequences, and that would include law of the

10
11

case.
And in this particular case, the bankruptcy

12

court has retained jurisdiction, the consensual plan to

13

which the parties agreed is to be implemented over a

14

period of 5 years, approximately, it is to prevent

15

collateral estoppel effects flowing from that judgment,

16

and we believe that, notwithstanding the respondent's

17

argument there are collateral estoppel effects that might

18

flow here under the United States v. Mendoza case which

19

applies collateral estoppel to issues of law, and those --

20

QUESTION:

-- indicated that a court could

21

adopt, say, the Ninth Circuit, a rule that vacated

22

opinions to have precedential value, so even though you

23

might prevail in a subsequent quasi collateral estoppel,

24

there would be no collateral estoppel but you'd lose

25

anyway under this hypothetical rule, which seems to me a

very strange rule.
MR. ANDERSON:

2

If there were litigation outside

3

the Ninth Circuit, Your Honor, I'm not sure that would be

4

the case.

8

The precedent certainly might be binding -QUESTION:

back in the Ninth Circuit.
MR. ANDERSON:

11

We would be in that situation.

The precedent would be then binding in the Ninth Circuit.
QUESTION:

10

No, I'm talking about, assume you're

But no estoppel, even in the Ninth

Circuit, because that requires a judgment.
MR. ANDERSON:

That's correct.

That's correct,

12

Your Honor, although to a certain degree, as Justice

13

Kennedy pointed out, there is a merging of the estoppel

14

effect and the precedential effect within the confines of

15

the Ninth Circuit, and only within those confines.

16

QUESTION:

Well, under your theory that it's

17

within the discretion of the court to decide whether to

18

vacate the judgment or not, if the court were to decide

1

not to vacate this judgment after the settlement, is that

20

an abuse of the court's discretion?

21

MR. ANDERSON:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

I

22

think the court may exercise that discretion in any way it

23

seems fit, and I don't believe that would be an abuse of

24

discretion.

QUESTION:

So you just leave it entirely open to

1

the court to weigh the factors one way or another and

2

decide what to do?
MR. ANDERSON:

3

Subject to the general rule that

4

we suggest that vacatur upon mootness where the mootness

5

occurs as a result of settlement is generally appropriate

6

for the reasons that it promotes the values that we have

7

described in our briefs -- fairness between the parties,

8

and the prudential concerns that the judicial system must

9

have with regard to the development of precedent.
QUESTION:

10

Well, in this case, what possible

11

grounds, under your rule, would a court have for refusing

12

to vacate?

13

MR. ANDERSON:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. ANDERSON:

16
17
18
19
20
21

In this particular case?

Yes.
I don't believe there would be

any grounds for refusing to vacate in this case.
QUESTION:

Well then, the answer to Justice

O'Connor is it would be an abuse of discretion.
QUESTION:

You told me it would not be an abuse

of discretion to refuse to vacate.
MR. ANDERSON:

That's correct, Your Honor, and

22

perhaps I misunderstood your question.

23

decisions of this Court are generally not reviewable, I

24

wouldn't think that -- it could not be characterized as an

25

abuse of discretion.

Since the

(Laughter.)

1

QUESTION:

2

3

Well, let's talk about a court of

appeals.
MR. ANDERSON:

4

I think there are some

5

differences when you begin to talk about the court of

6

appeals, Your Honor.

7

QUESTION:

Okay.

It's a court of appeals on

8

these facts, and the court of appeals refuses to vacate

9

the judgment.

Is that an abuse of discretion?

MR. ANDERSON:

10

I would think it would be.

I

11

would think it would be, and the reason is, as long as

12

there is an appeal pending so that that decision which the

13

court of appeals is reviewing is not final, the court of

14

appeals has not been able to complete its review of that

15

decision, then the judgment should be vacated.

16

QUESTION:

What if the court of appeals has

17

decided the case, but there's a petition for rehearing

18

pending?

19
20

MR. ANDERSON:

the same rule should apply.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. ANDERSON:

23
24
25

I would say that that would be,

They should vacate the decision.
That decision is not final.

That

decision is not final.

of the ball game.

QUESTION:

1

Aren't you, in effect, asking the

2

Court to write a term into the settlement agreement that

3

you did not successfully negotiate?

4

agreements put in the agreement itself that a term of the

5

settlement is that the decision will be vacated.

6

you're asking the Court, in effect, to put in as a term of

7

the settlement what the opposing party and you didn't

8

negotiate.
MR. ANDERSON:
QUESTION:

10
11

Many of these

Here,

Justice --

Because Bonner is resisting the

vacation.
MR. ANDERSON:

12

Bonner is resisting it, Justice

13

Ginsburg.

However, it was not a term that was negotiated,

14

we do not believe, however, and we do not urge that that

15

be a distinguishing consideration, because the principles

16

underlying vacatur, fairness, and the prudential concerns

17

that I mentioned, particularly fairness we don't believe

18

should be premised on the relative bargaining power of the

1

parties.

Fairness -QUESTION:

20

Well, I don't understand why you're

21

in a different position from somebody who's just decided

22

to forego an appeal, why we should treat you differently

23

from someone who has withdrawn an appeal, or decided not

24

to appeal.

1

some of the factual considerations that led us to where we

2

are today, I think that will answer the question.
For example, in this case, the parties were

3
4

negotiating prior to the filing of the bankruptcy case in

5

1991.

6

that it was willing to live with.

7

very basic minimums that it required, a market rate of

8

interest, an adequate loan-to-value ratio, things of that

9

nature.

U.S. Bancorp had proposed certain settlement terms
Those terms included

10

Those terms were ultimately what was accepted by

11

Bonner in January of 1994 and then some subject to certain

12

other conditions which then also were met later so that

13

the consensual plan could be confirmed in March of 1994.

14

Bonner was the party that made certain

15

concessions and decided to forego reliance on the decision

16

it had won in the Ninth Circuit.

17

exercise unilateral action.

18

U.S. Bancorp did not

When you look at the facts in that light, I

19

think what you see is that U.S. Bancorp was in the

20

position of having to choose in this dilemma whether to

21

accept an economic settlement which was favorable on its

22

terms or having to defend a decision, or to challenge a

23

decision in the Ninth Circuit which the prevailing party

24

was no longer willing to litigate and was willing to

25

forego, so it is not unilateral action in that sense at

all.
I think also that the fact that this Court

granted certiorari is perhaps one of the most salient

elements of this particular case.

is that the settlement which I briefly described was a

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Since this Court's decision in Munsingwear and,

of the parties.
QUESTION:

You're talking, then, not just about

judgments, you're talking about opinions also?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Judgments should be vacated.

5

follows from that, in our view, that the precedential

6

impact of the decision is also eliminated.

7

9

QUESTION:

It

You don't agree, then, with your

colleague who just spoke?
MR. KNEEDLER:

I do not.

One of the important

10

points the Court made in Munsingwear itself was that the

11

decision should be vacated in order to prevent it from

12

spawning any legal consequences, and those legal

13

consequences could be collateral estoppel, they could be

14

law of the case, but they can also importantly be the

15

precedential impact of the decision in other cases.

16
17
18

So it is an important aspect of the vacatur to
eliminate the precedential impact of the decision.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, you're right that we've

19

done it often, but almost all the times we've done it,

20

we've done it by way of a per curiam opinion or summary

21

disposition.

case I recall where we've discussed the reasons for it,

23

and we also have a principle in matters of procedure and

24

judicial administration stare decisis is least strong.

In fact, In think Munsingwear is the only

make in response to that.

Munsingwear was a discussion of

2

the issue, but included in the Court's discussion in

3

Munsingwear where the Court announced its general rule, it

4

made no mention of the word happenstance.

5

referred to its established practice when a case becomes

6

moot, and cited a number of cases, four of which, as is

7

pointed out in footnote 5 of petitioner's brief, involved

8

settlement.

The Court

9

So the Court was recognizing that the general

10

practice that it had already established at the time of

11

Munsingwear applied to settlement, so there was no need to

12

separately discuss, no need on this Court's part to

13

separately discuss how that rule should apply to

14

settlement because the Court was already relying on cases

15

that involved settlement, and that, the Court's following

16

of that practice since that time simply confirms that

17

there has been a general rule.

18

The question before this Court is whether the

19

Court should now depart from that general rule, and we

20

think that respondent has shown no reasons for doing so.

The problems with a case --

Munsingwear itself the issue was litigated completely, and

at that time the Court was relying on cases that involved

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, and then what -- the Court

That's the point that I'm making.

assume for the moment that that's correct.

2

Court could have been just saying that the review was

3

precluded by circumstances beyond the Court's control, but

4

the important point, there was just a reference in one

5

sentence to the word happenstance, but when the Court

stated its general rule, it did not contain the word

happenstance on page 39 where the Court described its

established practice, and again referred to cases

involving settlement.

10

I think the

Now, to depart from that and adopt a case-by-

11

case rule would have a number of disadvantages.

12

take this Court's time in looking at the facts of each

13

case to see whether vacatur would be appropriate.

would also undermine the certainty and predictability for

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, it doesn't say anything about

MR. KNEEDLER:

1

Well, the precedent comes from

2

the judgment of the Court and the opinion explaining the

3

judgment, and the extent of the opinion that's necessary

4

to the judgment becomes precedent, but it is the judgment

5

that is the judicial role, it is the judgment that settles

6

the case or controversy, and therefore the judgment that

7

is binding precedent in other cases.
QUESTION:

9

Mr. Kneedler, have you ever cited a

case, has the Government ever cited cases in a brief in

10

which it cites a case as authority and then says,

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, citing it for its persuasive

force if it is -- if the judgment is vacated and not

14

reinstated, I don't think it has binding precedential

impact, force.

We would cite it for whatever force it

this panel decided?

Would you follow the opinion, or

2

would you say well, it doesn't count, if you were a

3

district judge?
MR. KNEEDLER:

4

If the court, if the district

5

court found it persuasive, it could follow it, but the

6

point is, it would be an independent act of judging on the

7

district court's part to decide what the correct result

8

was without having that answer dictated by the court of

9

appeals' decision.
And after all, the court of appeals' decision

10
11

was rendered tentative at best by virtue of this Court's

12

grant of certiorari, and it seems to us it would be unwise

13

to leave a decision that this Court has found sufficient

14

reason to grant review and perhaps reversed, standing as

15

binding precedent in the court of appeals, and not free

16

the parties to litigate that question in other cases.

QUESTION:

2

All right, so the grant of certiorari

MR. KNEEDLER:

3

Well, it just indicates from the

perspective of this Court's role, this Court sits to

5

resolve conflicts or to resolve differences in the lower

6

courts, and in this case the Ninth Circuit's decision on

7

the new value exception was the first decision after this

Court's decision in Northwest Bank sustaining the new

value exception.
It would be consistent with this Court's role of

10

11

superintending the decisions in the lower courts to

eliminate that precedent, and to allow the issue to

back to the district judge to make a decision about that.

7

I, as a

And the reason I would have had him do that is

8

there are not many, but there are quite a few complex

9

litigations involving cleaning up the Boston Harbor, for

10

example, or managing mental health facilities, for

11

example, and the vacating of a judgment might have

12

significant implications on lots of other parties to the

13

mental health litigation or the clean-up-the-harbor

14

litigation, and might have changed their whole strategy

15

were something like that to come up, or might have all

kinds of implications that only the district court would

17

know about.

18

Therefore, even had they agreed on the

19

settlement, I would have sent it back to get the district

court's determination about how it affects third parties.

21

Now, where I don't even have that agreement, I

when the appellant doesn't dismiss the appeal, the

different from where the party has just decided to let the

That's the first thing.

The second thing is that what causes - - what

Karcher v. May, but it limits vacatur to its proper place,

5

an equitable rule that is discussed in Munsingwear, and

6

when mootness is due to circumstances beyond the parties'

7

control, it is unfair to apply preclusion and collateral

8

estoppel to those parties in that dispute.

9

That would be the only circumstance where

10

routine vacatur should occur, is when you have a situation

11

of happenstance.

And makes it a condition -- then they

MR. ELSAESSER:

5

Well, then I think you're

I don't believe there is any effective

difference, because in both situations you end up with a

dismissal.

You end up with a dismissal of the appeal.
QUESTION:

6

Yes, but certainly in Karcher v. May

7

there was nothing consensual about it as to the party who

8

was seeking to appeal, but it was said to have no

9

standing.

10

MR. ELSAESSER:

No, there was nothing consensual

11

in not having any standing, but when the appeal ends,

12

there was no reason to go back down and vacate the lower

13

court opinions, so in that situation I think that's the

14

same result you gain in this particular case, where the

15

bank makes a conscious decision that as part of the

16

settlement, or by settling, by their act of settling they

17

moot the appeal.

I think the effect is the same.

10

They have an interest, as they've conceded in

11

their brief, that they want to be able to relitigate the

12

issue in the Ninth Circuit and perhaps their companions

13

elsewhere wish to do the same in other circuits, but it is

14

true that our party has no identifiable interest in

vacating a particular judgment, particularly in this

It made no specific findings of fact.

Is it clear that the petitioner here

would not be bound by the decision below insofar as res

22

MR. ELSAESSER:

Your Honor, we agree with the

issues of law as well as of fact?

13

MR. ELSAESSER:

QUESTION:

Yes, they do, Your Honor.

All right.

So why couldn't the bank,

having litigated and lost this issue, be taken to have

litigated it and lost it against all the world, and then

17

there would be preclusion, collateral estoppel with

MR. ELSAESSER:

I don't believe, Your Honor,

20

that Mendoza would go so far as to preclude -- if this

Court vacates the rulings below, as far as they want them

22

to have vacated, I don't believe that that would have a

What about in this very case?

At

the same circumstance and again the new value issue coming

up in this very case.
MR. ELSAESSER:

they have responded in argument, that the precedential

MR. ELSAESSER:

There should be no way.

They didn't have to settle.
They did not have to settle, but

in addition to that, there are no extrinsic grounds to

There would be no

essentially contracted -- they've contracted their own res

over what the prior rulings were below, because they've

3

the offer had been made and accepted, and I think that is

the strongest argument against vacatur upon settlement, is

because it clearly allows for the purchase of precedent,

Well, absolutely, Justice

Scalia, because to make that a part of a bargain, it's no

more proper in that circumstance to be able to, for us to

be able to sell the precedential value of that opinion

MR. ELSAESSER:

you've got the unique situation of the Government where

they're making laws and they're enforcing laws, and I

think in that particular situation it was merged.

The

10

legislative or administrative section of Government

changed the regulation, and the council responsible, or

12

the department responsible for enforcement therefore lost

its rights.

I believe that's an external cost.

in the Phillips situation, I think that's perhaps the

clearest example, is that we know -- we don't have to

speculate on this broad question of whether vacatur

We know in that situation Phillips has, for

$57 million, bought the right to relitigate the issue in

Illinois and pretty much as many times as they want, if

they have other defendants on the same issue, and in this

brief, is they believe there is a tangible benefit to be

gained by really starting a relitigation of the new value

rule in the Ninth Circuit all over again from the

settlement table to the bankruptcy court to either the BAP

Well, we're indebted to you for doing

that.
(Laughter.)
MR. ELSAESSER:

Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, I

17

think I would argue that the idea or the concept of

18

evading precedent, -or evading preclusion, as a grounds for

19

vacatur, is a recent phenomenon.

20

I would argue that at the time of Munsingwear,

21

and in the summary treatment that this Court has given

22

Munsingwear since its enactment, that litigants frankly

23

did not see the possibility of being able to buy a court

24

decision, being able to use a procedure that is -- if one

25

reads Munsingwear really has no application.

disposition of cases, this presented an opportunity.

4

in the last 10 years and, really, to a great amount only

5

in the last 5 years, have the circuits had before them

6

situations which it is clear that, for instance, in the

7

Oklahoma City case the Government is coming in and buying

8

a decision.

and buying a decision.

Only

In the Phillips case, Phillips is coming in

In the other cases decided in the Second

11

Circuit, where they did make a distinction between

12

appellate opinions and district court judgments, again in

13

the Manufacturers Hanover case just in the past year-and-

14

a-half the concern is there that, if you allow routine

15

vacatur upon settlement, whether or not you're

16

presented -- whether you're ever presented with anything

17

other than a notice by the parties, or whether you're

18

presented, as they were in Oklahoma City, with a joint

19

motion contemplating vacatur, in either of those

20

circumstances, every circuit other than the Federal

21

circuit that had to address vacatur upon settlement in

recent times have said, this is not a Munsingwear

situation.

We have the doctrine of collateral estoppel.

you follow the results, without vacatur, of this case,

there will be unfairness, because an outside occurrence

QUESTION:

And in a case where a party has

voluntarily declined to pursue his legal remedy, there's

no equity in relieving him of the judgment below?

5

MR. ELSAESSER:

No, and I would argue that that

is the finding in Karcher, is that voluntary termination

7

makes no effective difference.

8

9

I would further like to argue, and argue in
conclusion, that the decision of a court, this Court under

10

these circumstances or any other court, is a decision.

11

don't believe you -- that it can be avoided that this is a

12

decision, it is a ruling.

13

I

I do agree with the Government that it does, a

14

vacatur does specifically vacate precedent.

I don't know

15

how the terms vacating can do anything with the Ninth

16

Circuit opinion but to vacate precedent and relegate it to

17

arguable authority.

event, this outside event, the decision that any court

There's no reasoning presented.

There has still been no articulate reasoning of

why the court should vacate by the bank, other than the

Ninth Circuit might have been wrong, we couldn't find out,

so there should be an asterisk by the decision that

It wouldn't be practical for this Court to have

What about the people that have been

operating under our Munsingwear rule and have bought

What do we tell them now?
Justice Scalia, I don't think

they've bought it fair and square, because they're

this Court have been summary dispositions, first of all.

we stand here, in the various circuits in either a

Even the California supreme court, which has

been truly the champion of vacatur, just last week backed
