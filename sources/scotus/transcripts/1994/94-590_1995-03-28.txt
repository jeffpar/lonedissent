ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY R. VOLPERT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. VOLPERT:

11
12

Is that

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

13

The issue presented is whether a school district

14

faced with a serious drug problem with student athletes at

15

its core may reasonably require athletes to submit to drug

16

testing absent individualized suspicion.

17

The school district has established a serious

18

threat to its ability to educate its students and to the

19

safety of its athletes
QUESTION:

20

Has it identified that threat as drug

21

use, as opposed to, sort of a lot of bragging about drug

22

use?

23

the hard evidence on the actual usage was on the thin

24

side, whereas there was plenty of evidence that people

25

were going around bragging about drug use, glorifying drug

It seems to me, my recollection is that the, kind of

use, giving the impression that it was a smart thing to

2

do, and kids at that age claim to have done a lot of

3

things that they haven't done.

4

the hard evidence stop and the evidence of talk begin?

5

3

MR. VOLPERT:

Where does the, sort of

The hard evidence of drug use

6

consists, Justice Souter, of observations on numerous

7

occasions by a teacher of students smoking marijuana

8

across the street, arrests of student athletes for using

9

drugs, confiscation of drug paraphernalia on school

10

grounds, admissions by students to the principal that they

11

have used drugs, admissions by certain student athletes to

12

the coaches that they had used drugs, coaches'

13

observations of marijuana coming from the room of athletes

14

the day after a serious injury --

15
16

QUESTION:
for example.

Well, there was one example of that,

Was there more?

17

MR. VOLPERT:

18

QUESTION:

I'm sorry, of what?

I mean, the -- as I recall the

19

briefs, there was one example of a coach going into a -- I

20

think it was a wrestler's room, and he smelled -- after

21

the kid had been injured, and he smelled pot.

22

were there other instances of that?

23

MR. VOLPERT:

There were no other instances that

24

I can recall from the record, Justice Souter, where the

25

smell of marijuana, where the teachers or coaches noticed

2

the smell of marijuana.
QUESTION:

I think that's what's bothering me,

3

because -- I'm sure you didn't intend this, but I think

4

you spoke of it in the plural, and yet there was only one

5

instance of it, and that's why I'm troubled by the

6

difficulty of figuring out just what is provably there

7

about use, as opposed to what is generalization, or what

8

is generalization about student bragging.

9

MR. VOLPERT:

Well, I could only answer that by

10

saying that I believe that we have numerous -- I don't

11

believe, we do have numerous observations, admissions,

12

proof of athletes being arrested for the use of drugs, and

13

there is -- I believe what you're referring to is, there

14

is one instance, and I did not mean to speak of it in the

15

plural, where a wrestler -- where a coach smelled

16

marijuana coming from a wrestler's room.

17

The one thing that it seems to me is missing

18

from this record is a direct observation of a student

19

athlete using drugs and then, for instance --

20

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Volpert, did the school

21

district try a drug testing scheme based on reasonable

22

suspicion that a particular student might be experimenting

23

with drugs?

24
25

MR. VOLPERT:

If you mean urinalysis drug

testing, Justice O'Connor, no, they did not.

1

Well, the same kind of testing you're

2

doing under -- or the school was doing under this

3

random --

MR. VOLPERT:

QUESTION:

No, they --

-- testing.

You didn't ever use

reasonable suspicion, and for those that the coaches

7

suspected of using drugs --

8

MR. VOLPERT:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

We did not --

Ask them to be tested.

MR. VOLPERT:

Excuse me.

We did not ever

combine reasonable suspicion with urinalysis drug testing.

12

QUESTION:

Why not?

13

MR. VOLPERT:

There's no direct evidence in the

14

record with regard to that.

15

district determined, the school district and the school

16

board made a reasonable determination that first of all

17

they would have difficulty making a reasonable accusation

18

based only on suspicion of drug intoxication, and second

19

of all, that they assumed that there would not be the

20

deterrent effect that a random drug testing program would

21

have, because the only way to -- if you are basing it on

22

reasonable suspicion, you are largely left to observing

23

behavior, and bizarre behavior, and then reaching a

24

conclusion --

saying.

If somebody says they have been experimenting,

2

you don't think that would give rise to reasonable

3

suspicion --

4

MR. VOLPERT:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. VOLPERT:

Well, the --

-- that it might be true?
The problem is that if someone

7

says on Wednesday that they have used drugs in the past, I

8

am not at all convinced that there would be a reasonable

9

suspicion sufficient to test them at that time, just based

10
11

on conversations of past drug use.
QUESTION:

Do you think that the rule that we

12

announce ought to be a rule that's specific on a school-

13

by-school, case-by-case basis, or would it be plausible

14

for us to say, a) there is a drug problem of dangerous

15

proportions in this middle and high school population

16

throughout the country, and that even those schools that

17

are relatively drug free have a strong interest in keeping

18

themselves that way?

19

MR. VOLPERT:

Justice Kennedy, I believe that

20

this Court's holdings in Skinner and Von Raab, this Court

21

could reach such a conclusion.

22

there is a reasonable basis for drawing the line and

23

requiring individual school districts to establish, or to

24

reasonably conclude that they have individual problems.

25

QUESTION:

However, I think that

Suppose there are three high schools, one with a serious

2

drug problem, the other mild -- the other mild by today's

3

standard, which means only 10 percent of the students are

4

using them from time to time -- and the other

5

substantially less than that.

6

wide rule?

7

MR. VOLPERT:

Could you have a district­

If the school district on the

8

local level determined that there was a serious drug

9

problem in one of the schools, and after deliberation

10

reached a reasonable conclusion that there was an

11

immediate threat to the other schools, I believe you

12

could.

13

QUESTION:

How about our decision in the City of

14

Renton case dealing with adult bookstores and so forth?

15

There we said that one city council could rely on findings

16

made by other city councils as to the effect of adult

17

bookstores in connection with neighborhood deterioration?

18

MR. VOLPERT:

Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that

19

certainly a school district could rely on evidence of a

20

drug problem in neighboring school districts.

21

believe that based on this Court's decisions, especially

22

in Von Raab, this Court could decide that a school

23

district without any drug problem could rely on national

24

evidence, but I think that there is a reasonable basis for

25

drawing a line and allowing individual school boards to

I also

make that determination.
That is not to say that it would have to be

based on -- that it has to be based on evidence in each

school in the district.

be based on evidence of a drug problem in the county, or

in the general area.

serious and eminent threat of drug use in the schools, we

believe that testing should be allowed.

population?

random testing of the entire school population in these

schools?

And haven't, in fact, you made -- if your

MR. VOLPERT:

15

Justice Souter, under the facts of

16

this case, I believe we have probably made a sufficient

17

case for drug testing of the entire student body of the

18

Vernonia School District.

No, that would not be our

argument.
Our --my argument is that that, in fact,

base that on speculation that because athletes are using

beyond any reasonable doubt, that there was a drug problem

which was all-pervasive throughout the school system,

QUESTION:

11

Mr. Volpert, isn't there a

12

significant difference between the people who go to

13

school, who are required to go to school by State law, and

14

athletes?

15

The athletes sign a consent form, do they not?

16

Isn't there a difference between athletics, which is a

17

volunteer activity -- I thought that you were relying on

18

that distinction, and that's why you were limiting the

19

testing to the athletics program, but now you tell me no,

20

it's just on the basis of pervasive drugs.

MR. VOLPERT:

1

question, I was simply suggesting that it would be

2

possible-to establish a situation that was so bad in the

3

general school population and was such a threat to the

4

preservation of order in the schools that would justify

5

testing of all athletes -- excuse me, of all students.

6

That is not --

7

QUESTION:

But didn't you also say that you had

8

it here, that you had made the case here, or could have

9

made the case here?

10
11
12

MR. VOLPERT:

I think hypothetically we could

have made that case under these facts.
QUESTION:

So that you didn't -- on your theory

13

you didn't need, as Justice Ginsburg points out, the

14

feature of the voluntary consent form.

MR. VOLPERT:

QUESTION:

Extreme problem.

Let me ask a different question.

22

Supposing -- if it's that serious, you're also assuming

23

it's so serious you can't -- you wouldn't have any

24

individualized suspicion as to particular students who

25

might be using drugs.

It would be sort of a

contradiction, it seems to me.
MR. VOLPERT:

2

Well, I don't think so, Justice

3

Stevens, because if you -- it's kind of hard to

4

characterize the record in this case, but when you read

5

the record in its entirety, you realize the extent to

6

which drug use became -- the extent to which disciplinary

7

problems became pervasive.
QUESTION:

10

But Mr. Volpert, we have findings.

What did the -- the district court made findings, and the
Ninth Circuit said, we accept those findings.

Circuit came out the other way.

The district court found, Justice

19

Ginsburg, a startling and progressive increase in the use

20

and glamorization of drugs, characterized the student body

QUESTION:

Pardon me?

None of that sounds like it's

confined to athletes.
MR. VOLPERT:

Justice Stevens, the district

court found that the athletes were among the leaders of
the group in the classroom who were causing disruptions.

11

QUESTION:

How do they know that if they don't

12

have individualized suspicion?

13

MR. VOLPERT:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. VOLPERT:

16
17

That's what puzzles me.

How do they know that --

Yes.
That the athletes were being

disruptive?
QUESTION:

No, no.

They know who the leaders

18

are who are the most frequent users of drugs, but they

19

don't have any individualized suspicion as to particular

20

individuals.

21

MR. VOLPERT:

Well, the district courts referred

22

to the conclusion that this was -- that the conduct was

23

drug-related, if that's what you're asking, as being

24

inescapable, and the Ninth Circuit said that the

25

was so far out of the norm that drug use was a logical

2

conclusion.

QUESTION:

3

4

Now -Well, that would be individualized

suspicion, wouldn't it?
MR. VOLPERT:

5

Well, I don't think so

6

necessarily.

If you see in the classroom someone

7

misbehaving, and you're a teacher, you at that point have

8

to make an important choice if you're suggesting that you

9

drug test based on individualized suspicion.

You have to

10

decide -- make very difficult decisions as to whether this

11

behavior is so bizarre that it indicates the use of drugs,

12

and that you're going to make an accusation and drag

13

someone down to the principal's office --

14

QUESTION:

But Mr. Volpert, isn't that pretty

15

much what the Fourth Amendment is designed to require,

16

something based on individualized suspicion, and the

17

school district didn't even try that, did they?

18

MR. VOLPERT:

19

QUESTION:

Well --

I mean, the school made no effort to

20

at least launch its program on the basis of some kind of

21

testing based on individualized suspicion, and I think in

22

the school context we've said it doesn't have to be

23

probable cause, but there was no effort made to do that,

24

was there?

MR. VOLPERT:

The district took many, many steps

to try to solve it as a behavioral problem --

Well --- observing behavior and dealing

with it.
QUESTION:

-- let me ask you this.

Suppose we

were to conclude that at least on this record the school

should try individualized suspicion.

here by the use of consent forms.

position that if there is a valid consent form by the

14

student and the student's parents that there would for

that student not have to be individualized suspicion?

QUESTION:

Yes, so you might have some

combination in effect.

MR. VOLPERT:

The problem, Justice O'Connor,

24

with individualized suspicion is clear in our record in

Skinner, and clear in the record in Von Raab.

2

is so difficult to detect for certain that you have any

3

kind of drug involvement in behavior, especially with

4

adolescents --

5
6

QUESTION:

Because it

A reasonable suspicion doesn't mean

for certain, does it?

7

MR. VOLPERT:

No, it does not, but when you are

8

asking a teacher to actually make an accusation of drug

9

use, and that accusation is based on a number of

10

circumstances, it is far less intrusive in a circumstance

11

like this to allow the random drug testing rather than

12

just fingering individual athletes, taking them to the

13

principal's office, and make them submit to the test.

14

would also --

15

QUESTION:

You

It's not only less intrusive, I take

16

it the suggestion of individualized suspicion would alter

17

fundamentally the relation between the student and the

18

teacher.

19

MR. VOLPERT:

I think it would, Justice Kennedy.

20

Certainly under this record I think virtually everyone

21

acting up in the classroom would have been taken down to

22

the principal's office and basically accused of drug use.

23

In this situation, contrary to the position --

24

QUESTION:

25

Not accused, just asked to be tested,

isn't that the proposal?

MR. VOLPERT:

1

Except that in the situation of

2

individualized suspicion, you are telling an individual

3

student, I believe that you are using drugs, and I think

4

the Court must focus on the burden that that places on

5

teachers to actually make that type of accusation.

are not experts in the field.

both, i.e., the behavioral evidence and the consent forms,

are sufficient, and that's as far as your argument goes?

MR. VOLPERT:

No.

Our argument here is that the

behavior, which disrupted the classroom severely, and the

threat to student athletes were sufficient to jeopardize

7

MR. SEAMON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
I'd like to begin by addressing a question that

8

arose earlier.

The question was, if there was so much

9

evidence of drug use in Vernonia, why wasn't there enough

10

individualized suspicion to make individualized suspicion-

11

based testing effective?

12

That question is plainly relevant under the

13

balancing approach this Court applied in Skinner and Von

14

Raab, because even though the Court declined to impose a

15

least intrusive means requirement in its analysis, it is

16

plain that alternatives to suspicionless testing are

17

relevant to decide whether suspicionless testing is

18

actually necessary to further the governmental interest

19

that is being asserted, and I think that the limitations

20

of individualized suspicion testing are illustrated well

21

on the facts of this case.

22

Some of the evidence concerned drug use by

23

individual students, and would have permitted

24

individualized suspicion-based testing of those

25

students -- for example, the students from whom drug

smoking marijuana in the coffee shop across the street

3

from the school, the students who were arrested for using

4

intoxicants at a party during the school day.

5

But this was not the only relevant evidence in

the record that there was a drug problem in Vernonia.

7

school district witnessed a two- to threefold increase in

8

disciplinary problems over the course of a couple of

9

years.

The

At the same time, it witnessed the rise of an

11

of drugs, whether true or false, was certainly relevant to

12

the officials' assessment of whether a drug problem

13

existed, and finally, the organization of groups with

14

names like The Drug Cartel.

15

Students boasting about their use

Now, maybe the fact that a student belongs to a

16

group called The Drug Cartel does not provide

17

individualized reasonable suspicion for testing that

18

individual.

19

fact that such a group springs into existence at the same

20

time that there is a two- to threefold increase in

21

disciplinary problems, and teachers for the first time

about it in essays that they hand in to be graded clearly

it's -- the fact that the program in this case was limited

going to do it all in school.

Would that be all right?

MR. CHRIST:
this way.

You identified -- let me respond

You've identified these procedures in Skinner

and Von Raab.

I do not read those opinions to say that

each and every one of those is essential, and I do not
read that opinion to say you give greater weight to one or
the other.
At the same time, I don't read those opinions to
say that a program completely lacking in all of them would
pass muster, which is what we have here, so I can't say
that if they have no direct observation but they still
require disclosure of medications, and they don't use
independent monitors, that that would pass muster.
QUESTION:

Well, you have some factors here that

didn't exist there, and that is the -- this is an athletic

It's not that you have to leave school entirely,

it's just that you don't play athletics.

MR. CHRIST:

But as Justice Souter indicated,

that --my fallback position is that if you say drug

testing is okay, then I at least want to stop this drug

Mr. Christ, supposing that instead of

and so -- but they don't set up a urine testing program,

3

they set up a breathalyzer program under exactly the same

circumstances here.

5

Is that -- I mean, what I'm trying to find out

6

is, is it the fact that it's the urine factor that makes

7

this invalid, or is it the factor that the Government

8

administers a test to some individual?

test okay?
MR. CHRIST:

Is a breathalyzer

No, we think not, but the problem

here is twofold.

13

the classroom and preventing -- and preserving athletic

safety, but in addition to that --

One, the purposes for which they're

Well, isn't there something broader,

16

the idea that drug use has a lot more -- brings with it a

17

lot more problems than that, just to try to ferret out

drug use?

19

MR. CHRIST:

Well, Your Honor, drugs do have a

20

problem, and no one is denying that, and they're a problem

21

for the young and the old, and if simply the problem of

22

drugs on the user is sufficient to justify the Government

23

in compelling urine tests, then we should all be subjected

24

to urine tests.

affects a student in many, many ways, doesn't it?

3

MR. CHRIST:

That's true, it does affect them in

4

many ways, and it's a tragedy if someone takes drugs,

5

young or old, but it has not been -- that has not been

6

offered as justification by the school district for this

7

drug test, and if you accept that as justification for

8

drug testing students, then I think that you have arrived

9

very nearly at universal drug testing, because you could

not confine your ruling to the school setting.

what extent some of that authority and responsibility can

be exercised by the school districts even when the parent,

particularly the parent in this case, doesn't want it to

be exercised.
There may be parents who don't like corporal

that we -- it existed at common law, and we won't use the

Eighth Amendment to say you can't have it, so you either

accept it, or you don't go to public school, and the

question here is whether this is another instance like

that.
But you're dealing with children.

You're not

The question is to what extent the school has

2

QUESTION:

And you said that would be

unconstitutional.-

3

MR. CHRIST:

4

QUESTION:

Yes.
I take it, then, that the intrusive

5

feature, or features, which are of concern to you in the

6

urine test in fact are not the quasi-exposure of having to

7

produce the sample with someone standing behind you,

8

because that doesn't occur in the breath test, so I take

9

it the reasons that you find the intrusiveness to be

10

unreasonable is that you are disclosing the contents of

11

something -- chemicals in your urine, chemicals in your

12

breath -- and you are being forced as a protective measure

13

in appropriate cases to disclose any drugs you may be

14

taking that might affect the test.

15
16
17

Those are the two points of intrusiveness that
are crucial for you, is that correct?
MR. CHRIST:

Correct, and I would add that

18

you're doing all of that without ever having given

19

suspicion to suspect that you've done anything wrong.

20

QUESTION:

Right.

I realize the question of

21

justification is there, too, but the features of

22

intrusiveness which are crucial to you are the disclosures

23

of knowledge which in effect can be gained either from

24

your admission of, or your disclosure of other drug use

25

and the testing of the chemicals.

Those are the two

features.

2

MR. CHRIST:

Correct.

3

QUESTION:

Yes.

4

QUESTION:

Now, presumably the disclosure of

5

what other prescription drugs you might be taking could be

6

easily cured.

7
8

These samples go to a testing lab, and the
student could fill out a form saying what they are, put it
in a sealed envelope, and have it transmitted to the

10

testing, the independent testing, without ever disclosing

11

to the school district at all what private prescription

12

medication is in use.

13

MR. CHRIST:

It must be possible, because it was

14

in Skinner and Von Raab, although I do not know why the

15

school district here did not, after Skinner and Von Raab,

16

adopt the same procedures.
