CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES ROTHFELD

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. ROTHFELD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

This case concerns two Oklahoma taxes, an excise

12

tax on motor fuel and the State income tax, that the court

13

of appeals held could not be applied to an Indian tribe or

14

to certain of its members.

15

taxes in turn, starting with the one on motor fuel.

Now, I'll talk about those

16

In holding the tax invalid, the court of appeals

17

applied what it thought to be a per se rule that precludes

18

the imposition of any State tax whose legal incidence

19

falls upon an Indian tribe unless that tax has been

20

expressly authorized by Congress.

21

Now, because the Court found as a matter of

22

State law that the legal incidence of the tax falls upon

23

the retailer of the fuel, and because the retailers in

24

this case are tribally owned convenience stores located on

25

Federal trust land in Indian country, the court of appeals

applied its per se rule to strike down the tax.
We think there are three things wrong with this

2

3

decision.

First, Congress has expressly authorized this

4

tax.

5

congressional action, should not have applied a per se

6

rule in the circumstances of this case, and third, the

7

court of appeals should not have found the legal incidence

8

of the tax to fall upon the retailer of the motor fuel.

Second, the court of appeals, even apart from the

First, Congress has, by statute, expressly

9
10

authorized the very tax that the State has imposed in this

11

case.

12

that States may impose taxes on motor fuel sold on United

13

States military or other reservations.

The Hayden-Cartwright Act provides in so many words

QUESTION:

Was this argument raised before the

court of appeals, Mr. Rothfeld?
MR. ROTHFELD:

It was not, Your Honor, but I

17

think that should not preclude its consideration here.

18

This is not a new claim or a new issue that's being

19

injected into the case at this point.

20

additional authority for what has been the Tax

21

Commission's consistent claim, and that claim is that the

22

tax here is not preempted.

23

This is simply

I think to consider that sort of preemption

24

claim the Court typically in Indian preemption cases looks

25

upon the entire body of Federal legislation and certainly

1

the Hayden-Cartwright Act is legislation that deals

2

specifically with the question of whether Congress

3

intended a tax of this kind to be preempted.
QUESTION:

4

Mr. Rothfeld, most of these gas

stations, I understand it, are in Indian territory but not

6

on the reservation.

show is that the reservation was -- is excluded.
MR. ROTHFELD:

10

I mean, the most this statute would

Well, I think, Your Honor, there

was no doubt about the meaning of the word "reservation"
at the time the act was written.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. ROTHFELD:

This Court --

It means Indian territory?
Well, I think that this Court had

13

said some years before in United States v. Celestine that

14

the term "reservation" is used in the land law to refer to

15

any body of land, large or small, that has been reserved

16

from sale by Congress for any purpose, and that --

17

QUESTION:

In the land law, but this is not land

18

law.

19

reservation, I hardly think that that refers to Indian

20

territory, apart from Indian reservations.

When you say, United States military or other

21

MR. ROTHFELD:

24

reservations at all.

25

Well, these --

At least, it's

highly questionable

That's even assuming that it covers Indian

1

does cover Indian reservations, Your Honor.

As I say, the

2

Court had defined the term "reservation" to include

3

specifically Indian reservations.

4

As to whether these particular lands are covered

5

by that, these are Federal trust lands, clearly lands that

6

have been reserved from sale by Congress, and as the Court

7

said in Celestine, the general use of the term is to refer

8

to lands that have been reserved for any purpose.

9
10

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Rothfeld, now, this Hayden-

Cartwright Act point was not raised below, or dealt with.

11

MR. ROTHFELD:

12

QUESTION:

That is true, Justice O'Connor.

It would require us to interpret the

13

meaning of "reservation" within that act I guess for the

14

first time.

15
16
17

MR. ROTHFELD:

That's true.

The Court has not

yet expressed an opinion on it.
QUESTION:

And there was nothing express in the

18

petition for certiorari here that referred us to the

19

Hayden-Cartwright Act.

20

MR. ROTHFELD:

Again, that is true, Your Honor,

21

but I think that the question presented in the petition is

22

whether or not this Oklahoma law is preempted, and clearly

23

to answer that question requires a consideration of the

24

body of congressional legislation.

25

I guess there is some parallel here in the

1

Independent Insurance Agents case that the Court relied

2

upon earlier this term in Lebron, and the issue is whether

3

the statute had been repealed, and that point was not

4

argued even in the briefs on the merits or at oral

5

argument, and nevertheless the Court found it was

6

appropriate to look to whether -QUESTION:

7

Your first question presented, which

8

I take it the Hayden-Cartwright Act would have to come

9

under, or -- it's not at all.

It says whether principles

10

of preemption or Indian sovereignty preclude a State from

11

imposing a tax on sales of motor fuel.
Now, it doesn't seem to me that that really

12

13

necessarily includes the idea that there's an applicable

14

statute.

15

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think, Your Honor, that's

16

a highfalutin way of asking whether or not the statute --

17

the State statute is preempted, and again it's difficult

18

to resolve a question of preemption, and particularly a

19

question of Indian preemption which the Court has looked

20

at the entire body of Federal legislation to see if there

21

is an extant Federal policy that bears on the question

22

without considering whether there is a Federal statute in

23

the area, and this Federal statute clearly expresses the

24

intent of Congress as to the particular point that's at

25

issue here, so I -7

QUESTION:

Mr. Rothfeld, even if you're right

2

that the Court could entertain this statutory argument,

3

isn't it extraordinary for this Court to be a court of

4

first view?

5

question clearly raised by a petition, it will wait for a

6

circuit split, but you're asking this Court to jump in and

7

interpret this statute before anyone else has, and that's

8

quite unusual.

9

Very often, the Court won't even address a

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg,

10

again, we are presenting the question of whether or not

11

this State law is preempted, and to answer that question

12

we think that it would be appropriate for the Court to

3

look to the entire body of Federal legislation to

4

determine whether or not Congress has expressed a policy

5

that bears on the particular tax.

6

QUESTION:

It might also be appropriate for the

7

Court to say, we leave that question to one side because

8

it has not aired before the court of appeals.

9

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I -- certainly that's

20

within the Court's discretion, Your Honor.

21

disagree with that, but I think that in this setting, in

22

which the question is whether Federal law displaces the

23

State tax, iooking to the body of Federal legislation is

24

an appropriate way of resolving that point.

25

I can't

And I think that it is quite clear that if the

1

Court were to look at the Hayden-Cartwright Act, it would

2

see that there is a Federal policy that deals specifically

3

with the question in this case, and specifically provides

4

that gasoline taxes and other motor fuel taxes may be

5

collected by States on reservations, and again, as I

6

suggested to Justice Scalia, there was no doubt about the

7

meaning of the word "reservation" at the time the act was

8

written.

9

QUESTION:

Your references to doubt I guess are

10

to the departmental view at the time.

We've never

11

construed it to cover an Indian reservation.

12

courts so construed it?

I

1

legislation that the tribe refers to in its brief is

2

essentially dead for this term of the Oklahoma

3

legislature, so there is no prospect that the case be

4

mooted, and I think this is clearly -- even if the Court

5

were to conclude that this was not a ground that it can

6

base its decision upon, this is not a ground for

7

dismissing the case as improvidently granted.

8

The Hayden-Cartwright Act was specifically noted

9

in the opinion of the court of appeals, which said that it

10

was not going to reach it, so the Court was certainly

11

aware of the existence of the act at the time the petition

12

was presented, and I should, I suppose, move on to the

3

question, perhaps the more fundamental question, entirely

4

apart from the act, of whether the court of appeals was

15

correct in saying that there is a per se rule that

6

precludes State taxation of the kind of this case.

7

We think that that clearly was wrong, and

8

explaining why that's so, it's useful to start with three

9

points that are not disputed between the parties in this

20
21

case.
I think, first, that both the United States and

22

the tribe recognize that the balance of State and tribal

23

interests, which ordinarily is of crucial importance in

24

resolving the question of whether a State may assert its

25

jurisdiction on the reservation, they acknowledge that

1

2

that balance decisively favors the State in this case.
They also acknowledge that their rule rests upon

3

a -- economically meaningless legal formulas, and the

4

formulas are of legal incidence that has no connection to

5

the economic realities in this case, and --

6

7

QUESTION:

Well, but it's one which I gather

your client has embodied in a statute.

8

MR. ROTHFELD:

9

QUESTION:

Well, I think that there is --

Isn't that so?

I mean, under

10

Oklahoma law the taxpayer here is deemed to be in this

11

case the retailer, and hence the tribe.

12

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, that was the court of

13

appeals conclusion, Your Honor.

14

a matter of State law, but we think that the question of

15

where the legal incidence falls has no economic bearing,

16

no bearing as a matter of economic reality.

17

the tribe acknowledges --

18

QUESTION:

We disagree with that as

I think that

Well, don't we draw -- I mean, not to

19

put too fine a point on it, but didn't Oklahoma win the

20

last case by a little line-drawing of exactly that sort?

21

Maybe I should ask whether you would like to win this one,

22

or for us to go back and adopt the dissent in the Oklahoma

23

Tax Commission case of a couple of weeks ago.

that it's the Commission's preference to win both of those

cases, and I --

QUESTION:

I guess that might be its position.

9

MR. ROTHFELD:

And I think that they are

10

entirely consistent.

11

in Jefferson Lines, it focused on an actual difference

12

between a sales tax and a gross receipts tax.

13

As I understand the Court's position

I mean, the Court pointed out that a sales tax

14

can be collected only in one State, and there, therefore,

15

is no possibility of --

16

QUESTION:

It did not focus on economic effects.

17

I mean, that was one reason why the dissent and the

18

majority parted ways.

19

MR. ROTHFELD:

No, that is certainly true, but

20

there was a real difference, a real world difference

between the two types of taxes that were at issue in that

You're telling me

there's no such thing as a tax on a retailer, then.
MR. ROTHFELD:

11

No.

I'm suggesting, Your Honor,

12

that what the Court should do is determine these cases

13

without reference to the formality at all, to the legal

14

formulas, and simply look to the effect of the State law

15

on the tribe.

16

QUESTION:

I'm saying if you do that there's no

He's going to pass it down all the time.
MR. ROTHFELD:

No, that is absolutely right, and

23

we therefore think that in determining whether a tax of

24

this kind is valid, the Court should look to whether or

25

not it has an impermissible effect on the tribe.

QUESTION:

But that's not what our previous

2

cases have done, is it?

3

you regard as a formalistic evaluation.

4

MR. ROTHFELD:

I mean, they have stuck to what

Well, I think that it's clear

5

from the body of the Court's cases that it has not

6

regarded legal instances as the be-all and end-all of the

7

inquiry that is necessarily decisive.

8

9

In the Sac and Fox and the Colville cases, for
example, the State imposed taxes, automobile and excise

10

taxes and registration fees, on members of the reservation

11

living on the reservation when there was the tribe living

12

on the reservation who garaged their cars on the

13

reservation, and the Court said that those taxes might

14

well be valid if they were apportioned to deal with use of

15

the car outside of Indian country.

16

The Court didn't say that the legal incidence of

17

the tax falling upon the member of the tribe was

18

dispositive in those cases.

19

In the Moe case, the Court also said that its

20

decision striking down State taxes did not deal with the

21

issue in which the receipts that are subject to tax are

22

attributable to nonreservation sales to nonmembers, and

23

the Court, I think generally, as in the Sac and Fox case,

24

has referred to the rule in State imposition of taxes on

25

Indians as a presumption.

Such a presumption presumably

may be overcome, so I don't think it's the case that legal

2

incidence is necessarily decisive.
What the Court has done is on a number of

MR. ROTHFELD:

Just make it a consumer-

That's true.

We think that it is

17

clear that Oklahoma, under Moe and Colville and Chemehuevi

18

and the other cases of the Court acknowledging the State's

19

power to impose such a tax, the State could modify the tax

20

legislation here.

21

The Court -- the tribe acknowledges in its brief

22

that all the State need do is insert somewhere in the text

23

of the tax statute the legislative intent that the burden

24

of the tax be borne by the consumer, that that's

25

sufficient to validate the tax.

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think that this case

5

actually is an illustration of the problem, that the

6

Oklahoma legislature I think had been laboring under the

7

assumption that the legal incidence of this tax fell upon

8

the consumer.

9

The State has consistently taken the position

10

throughout this litigation that it does not fall upon the

11

retailer, and one problem with this kind of formalistic

12

rule is that it will prompt people to search for statutory

13

ambiguities to devise tax exemptions for themselves.

14

That --

15

QUESTION:

But you're -- so you say perhaps the

16

Tenth Circuit was wrong here in deciding the question of

17

Oklahoma law as to where the incidence of the tax fell.

18

Is this the legislation that's dead for this session in

19

the Oklahoma legislature, to change the incidence of the

20

tax?

21

MR. ROTHFELD:

The legislation that is dead

22

would have declared the intent of the Oklahoma legislature

23

that the tax fall upon the consumer.

it's a question of Federal law.

Certainly in the first

4

instance it's a matter of State law, although if the rule

5

is, and we say it should not be, but if the rule is that

6

the legal incidence determines the availability of an

7

immunity from State taxation as a matter of Federal law,

8

if there is a Federal rule of preemption that turns upon

9

the existence of legal incidence, then clearly the Federal

Well, that's right.

We don't

suggest that it is a matter of Federal law where the legal

9

incidence lies as a matter -- as to the intent of the

20

Oklahoma legislature, and the Court has said that the

21

intent of the legislature is determinative in determining

where the legal incidence of a tax falls.

1

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, we think the court of

2

appeals is clearly wrong, and the court has in other

3

cases, as in Chemehuevi, a very similar situation, has

4

said that the court of appeals got it wrong and has

5

determined the legal incidence for itself.

6

I mean, I think that that -- the Chief Justice

7

referred to the cases of the Court accepting legal

8

incidence as dispositive.

9

the Court have done have found legal incidence as an easy

10

way of disposing of the case, and as in Chemehuevi, where

11

the court of appeals got it wrong, the court of appeals

12

has stepped in, and we think that it is clear here that

13

the court of appeals did get it wrong.

14

I think that what the cases of

As we read the tax statute, there are two

15

provisions that bear specifically on the question of

16

whether the consumer or the retailer bears the legal

17

incidence of the tax.

18

that it clearly is the consumer who bears the legal

19

incidence, and I think that if the Court chooses to move

20

in that direction and not reach the more fundamental

21

question of whether or not there is such a per se rule,

22

they can easily dispose of the case by finding that the

23

legal incidence does fall upon the consumer.

24
25

We think both of those indicate

Those two provisions I should know quickly.

One

of them is a definitional provision of the statute which
19

1

refers to collection of taxes by both retailers and

2

distributors, making clear that both of them were intended

3

by the legislature to collect the tax from someone further

4

down the distribution chain.

5

That is confirmed by another provision of the

6

statute, an exemption provision, which provides that

7

purchasers -- that's the ultimate consumers -- who buy

8

gasoline for agricultural uses are relieved of the

9

obligation of paying the tax, again indicating that it is

10

ordinarily the purchaser who is intended to pay the tax.

11

So I think that is an easy ground on which the

12

Court can dispose of this case, but I should return to the

13

question of whether or not --

14

QUESTION:

Are you saying then that if this

15

pending law, or this law that is now dead, had passed,

16

there'd be no difference at all in substance?

17

MR. ROTHFELD:

That is absolutely right, Justice

18

Ginsburg, and I think that is the most powerful argument

19

for why such a formalistic rule makes no sense.

20

The Court has said that legal incidence falls

21

upon the consumer where the legislator intends for the tax

22

to be passed on to the consumer.

23

the tax doesn't -- even though the State law doesn't

24

expressly require the pass-through.

25

in Chemehuevi, and that is true even when there is no

That is so even though

1

sanction imposed upon the retailer who fails to pass the

2

tax on.

3

Commission case and First Agricultural Bank cases.

That was the holding in the Mississippi Tax

4

So all that the legislature need do to change

5

the legislative incidence of this tax is declare somewhere

6

in the text of the statute its intent that the burden of

7

the tax be borne by the ultimate consumer, and as Justice

8

Scalia noted before, that makes no difference in reality.

9

It does not affect the tax collection procedure at all.

10

It does not collect the obligation upon the retailer in

11

this case.

12

To have the validity of the State tax law turn

13

upon that sort of formalism I think makes no sense.

14

Court has rejected that approach in Complete Auto and in

15

various other settings, and there is no reason why that

kind of dinosaur of a rule, having become extinct

everywhere else, should continue lumbering along here.

burden on the tribe by somehow threatening to infringe on

tribal sovereignty, or the mechanisms of tribal

invalidated State taxes, the tax should be invalid, so for

has judged taxes in which the legal incidence falls upon

The Court has viewed those in terms of the

The Court has said -Well, isn't the economic -- that's my

question.

If the price is $1 a gallon and it's set by

competition all over the State, and 20 cents of that

dollar is going to the State government,

I guess the tribe

10

also can charge $1 a gallon, because that's the

11

competitive price, and if they don't have to pay 20 cents

12

out of that dollar to the State, they can keep it, and so

those are the economic circumstances.

that that was the test.

MR. ROTHFELD:

though the legal incidence fell upon the member of the

tribe on the reservation, and I think that what the Court

3

has looked to throughout this body of cases is whether or

4

not the total -- the tax, as applied, has an impermissible

5

effect on the mechanisms of tribal Government.
In the cases in which the legal incidence was

6

7

found to fall upon someone other than the tribe, the Court

8

has looked to whether or not tribal operations would be

9

displaced, whether or not it was real tribal interest that

10

was at stake, and that is clearly not the case here where

11

all the tribe is doing is importing onto the reservation

12

goods manufactured elsewhere that are going to be marketed

for resale largely to non-Indians for use outside of

12

We agree with

Obviously, as the Chief Justice has just pointed

13

out, there is a Federal component to the extent that this

14

Court in Chemehuevi established foursquare the proposition

15

that the absence of an express pass-through provision in a

Federal component of the rule.

Beyond that, this Court has treated those

numerous to cite, but one which we have mentioned in our

different conclusion.

would like to make with respect to the fuel tax.

That's the first point that we

This takes us to the second point, which is that

4

independent examination of the court of appeals decision

5

by this Court in this case on the State law question with

6

reference to the incidence of the fuel tax would not

7

justify a different conclusion with respect to the court

8

of appeals conclusion that the incidence of the fuel tax

9

is, in fact, on retailers, in this case the Chickasaw

10
11

Nation, the retail Indian tribe.
QUESTION:

Is there any difference that the

12

consumer can see between what would have been if this law

13

had passed and what is?

Now, the formal incidence of the

14

tax is on the retailer.

If it had been placed on the

consumer, would there be any difference in what the

16

consumer would see at the pump, say?

17

MR. ARROW:

Justice Ginsburg, I would say in

18

answer to that that while it might be theoretically

19

possible that a retailer might choose to "absorb" part of

20

the tax and therefore there might be some theoretical

21

difference, our inclination is the same as the

22

implications of Justice Scalia's question, which is that

23

you know, can you really see any difference between the

24

tax and the -- regardless of where the incidence would be,

25

heavily on the fact that it indicates that somehow

this that something else requires payment of the tax by a

2

consumer, which is absolutely not the case.

3

We point out further that the provisions which

4

are really definitional as to the incidence of the fuel

5

tax are largely section 505 of the statute, specifically

6

section 505C, and also section 506 of the statute, which

7

provide -- and these are cited in our brief in chief --

8

which provide that the distributor is an agent of the

9

State for collection of the fuel tax.

10

And we find, as we have indicated in the rest of

11

our remaining brief, that as to those provisions, section

12

505C and section 506, as well as section 507, as well as

13

section 502, there are numerous provisions which are

14

ignored by the Tax Commission which establish the

15

definition of where the legal incidence of the fuel tax is

16

rather than simply carving out a phrase and basing their

17

argument on a negative implication of a provision of the

18

statute which is contained in the definition of "storage."

19

We submit that the statute taken as a whole, in

20

short, even though there is that possible implication, but

21

it requires a negative and an incorrect implication, that

22

nothing -- because nothing requires a distributor,

23

retailer, or dealer to collect, that something else

24

requires that collection be from consumers, and there

25

simply is no pass-through provision to consumers anywhere

With respect to the agricultural exemption which

is cited, and this is the second provision that is relied

4

upon primarily by the petitioner Tax Commission, they are

referring to the agricultural exemption in section 509 of

the statute, which simply states that anyone who is

claiming an agricultural exemption for gasoline to be used

And we have indicated to this Court, having

508B of the statute the identical provision with respect

to the aircraft tax indicates that the exemption is one

21

provisions of the statute are silent on this whatsoever,

critical provisions which we have cited to this Court

1

Justice Souter as recently as the Jefferson Lines case,

2

going back to Complete Auto Transit, has disregarded the

3

formalities involved in a tax, but in this case, we submit

4

to this Court that one either has a per se rule in this

5

complex area, or one does not.

6

In order for there to be a per se rule, one must

7

acknowledge the fact that the legal incidence must be

8

controlling for purposes of the per se rule if the per se

9

rule is to avoid cumbersome and duplicative litigation.

10

QUESTION:

Doesn't the incidence of the tax have

11

significance outside of the Indian law context?

12

if there's a failure to pay a concededly owed tax, the

13

State Tax Commission, it may depend on how the laws are

14

drawn whether they can come after the wholesaler or the

15

retailer or the purchaser, doesn't it?

16

MR. ARROW:

Yes.

I mean,

Yes, Chief Justice Rehnquist,

17

that's absolutely right.

18

specifically along those lines, that they're unlike the

19

Oklahoma cigarette tax, unlike the California cigarette

20

tax at issue in Chemehuevi. Both of those cases contained

independent obligations on the parts of consumers to pay

cigarettes.

2

can have a statutory obligation to collect the tax.
MR. ARROW:

That -- in 1931, Your Honor, the

3

legal incidence could only be characterized as dual.

4

1931, the Oklahoma legislative scheme was amended to

5

include a situation whereby the wholesaler paid the tax

6

but could, at its option, pass the tax along to retailers,

7

and so both, in those situations, the statutory scheme at

8

that point in time imposed obligations on both.

9

In

In 1933, during the Dust Bowl, and by the best

10

of our research, based upon what we found with references

11

to defaulting dealers in the statute, in 1933 the

12

incidence clearly is moved onto wholesale -- onto

13

retailers, pardon me, with wholesale distributors -- what

14

has now become section 506 originated in 1933 -- with

15

wholesale distributors limited specifically to agents of

16

the State for collection.

17

And at that point, they still, and they do still

18

today, have an independent obligation to pay over to the

19

State -- to remit is the technical term of art which the

20

Oklahoma Fuel Tax Code uses -- to remit moneys to the

21

State which-have been collected from retailers, and there

22

is a penalty in section 506 for embezzlement.

23

evasion on the part of wholesalers, but rather for

24

embezzlement in those circumstances where wholesale

distributors do not pay over to the State that money which

Not for tax

1

we have collected, but there are independent payment

2

obligations on retailers also, such as section 505E.

3

So the answer to your question is yes, it is

4

possible that they both have obligations, one to remit

5

moneys that'it has collected, as the statute says, as the

6

agent of the State, and moneys which it holds in trust,

7

the other the primary obligation to pay, but in no sense

8

is there any obligation on consumers, and that's the

9

important point that I wanted to make in response to the

10
11

Chief Justice's question.
QUESTION:

Well, I have to confess that the

12

thing that keeps running through my mind is, as I remember

tax exemption by selling to nonmembers.

The premise of the Moe and Colville cases was

that the incidence of the fuel taxes there was on the

Again, Justice Scalia, with

respect to your question of a while ago, with respect to

14

your question as to whether there's really any such thing

from a standpoint of economic reality, you know, the

question, I suppose, might rhetorically be, is there any

difference between not charging a portion of the tax and

right, Your Honor, and that's part of my answer to Justice

Yes, I understand the question,

Fox addressed at least part of that question, as it had

prior to that in McClanahan.

The answer is, this Court in Sac and

In Sac and Fox, this Court indicated very

clearly that treaty questions aside, and other questions

presumption of the per se rule under McClanahan, and we

understand that.

But the answer, Your Honor, is that there is

20

simply no difference, because Chickasaw tribal members, as

21

all tribal members, are eligible for State services

22

whether or not they reside in Indian country, so to the

23

extent that the Tax Commission attempts to advance the

they're somehow entitled to more State services than

members who live in Indian country, this Court has already

held in Sac and Fox and McClanahan that those who work and

reside in Indian country are already exempt from State

income taxation.

And therefore the distinction, for this purpose,

7

Your Honor, the distinction is simply a distinction

8

without a difference from the standpoint of whether or not

9

the employee of the Government, of the tribe, lives within

10

or without Indian country, because under either

11

circumstance they're going to be eligible for State

12

services, and under those circumstances, there's no

principled basis for a distinction for purposes of

Our position is that the Court should resolve that issue

2

by applying the principle that a State may not directly

3

tax Indian activities in Indian country except where

4

Congress has abrogated tribal immunity in explicitly --

5

excuse me, in unmistakably clear terms.
Applying that principle, Oklahoma may not impose

6

7

its fuel tax on the Chickasaw Nation's retailers, because

8

Congress has not abrogated tribal immunity in this area,

9

and because under State law the court of appeals

10

reasonably concluded that legal incidence falls on the

11

retailer.

principle that if Congress hasn't abrogated the immunity,

the State can't?

2

Indian, in which case the tax could not be imposed, or

whether it was on a non-Indian, so there was legal

incidence there, as in Chemehuevi, that was the decisive

5

factor.

8

9

QUESTION:

And then -- and you say you trace

that back to a congressional determination of what?
MR. ENGELMAYER:

I think the basis for the per

se rule, which relies on legal incidence, goes back

10

historically to the sovereign immunity that tribes have

11

had under the -- vis-a-vis the States under the

12

Constitution.

13

It also, though, as the Court noted in County of

Yakima just 3 years ago, has practical justifications.

For example, one of them is that it serves the goal of

predictability.

rely categorically on the presence or absence of

18

congressional authorization in determining whether a tax

19

would be or is valid.

20

It allows both States and tribes alike to

It also obviates the need for an ongoing inquiry

21

into whether the balance of interests that at one point

22

may have justified a tax has changed over time, if, for

23

example, it is shown that only a portion of a given tax

24

maybe is being passed along.

dimension to it, in that it reflects the sovereign

2

immunity the tribes have under the Constitution vis-a-vis

3

the States, and finally, and perhaps this is most

4

important, it leaves the States with considerable

5

flexibility.

change the legal incidence of the fuel tax to make sure

that it falls on the ultimate purchaser.

in violation of settled principles announced by this Court

the Court reach the issue, our position is that the act

does not authorize State taxation of Indian tribes.

3

non-Indian company doing business for a tribe on its

reservation, this despite the fact that the Hayden-

whether the act even applies on a reservation.

There, the Court held

Our submission is that if the act did not
authorize direct taxation of a non-Indian company doing

10

business for a tribe on its reservation, it's awfully

11

difficult to see how the act could then be said to

12

authorize direct State taxation.

Moreover, applying the unmistakably clear

evidence that Congress considered the distinct barrier to

What the act does, I think, instead is to

address and get rid of a distinct separate barrier posed

by the territorial barrier posed by the Federal status of

appears that the statute requires that the retailer pay

the taxes to the distributor for remission to the State,

and the special fuels tax law that Oklahoma has at section

"No territory or State shall ever have the right

The treaty also provides that where any well-

of statutory construction that this court has used in many

MR. ENGELMAYER:

I think if we were talking here

agree with you that government probably would have

something more to do with the process of governance, as

you say.
But I think from the vantage point of the

2

MR. ROTHFELD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

3

There are a couple of points.

Let me start with

4

the motor fuel tax and questions that were raised by the

5

Chief Justice and Justice Stevens, whether or not the

6

legal incidence actually makes any difference in the real

7

world.

The only entity that has a legal obligation to

8

9

I think the answer quite clearly is no.

do something here, and against whom the State has any

10

rights, is the distributor, who neither of us suggests

11

bears the legal incidence of the tax, so the question then

12

is whether or not the State's failure to insert these

13

magic words of legal incidence somewhere in the text of

14

the tax statutes, words that would have no actual effect,

15

should render the tax invalid.

16

QUESTION:

If there's no difference, how do you

17

explain the reluctance of the -- or the nonaction by the

18

Senate in killing this bill?

19

MR. ROTHFELD:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. ROTHFELD:

Of the State --

Oklahoma.
I think that the State was of the

22

view that it should get this issue resolved, that it

23

should not be bound by a semantic rule to resolve its law

24

around something which is meaningless, and I think the

1

But since that would clarify it for

2

the future, there wouldn't be any possible doubt.

3

wouldn't they just go ahead and do it?
MR. ROTHFELD:

4

Why

Well, if the Tax Commission is

correct in its contention here that that rule should not

have legal effect, the legal incidence rule, then there is

7

no need for the State to modify its rule in accordance

with this.

type of rule.

It will always be the case that

incidence that it's possible to avoid it by changing the

13

in the past.

14

I mean, that has not been the Court's reaction

In a case like Complete Auto, the State could

15

have changes its law to delete the reference to privilege

16

of doing business in interstate commerce, which the

17

Court's prior decisions it heard, it felt held

18

determinative, and the Court said it wasn't necessary for

19

the State to modify its law around the formalism.

20

The proper course was to get rid of the

21

formalism so that it wasn't determinative in the future,

22

and clearly, as I was saying before, there is no real

23

world impact of determining the legal incidence falls on

24

one party or the other, and therefore the question is

whether or not the law should be held invalid because the

MR. ROTHFELD:

I think probably not, and the

12

reason is because the Court has said, looking to the

13

economic reality, that the State can't tax value generated

14

on the reservation by a tribal enterprise, and that

15

explains the outcome, I think, in cases like Colville and

16

Moe, in which the Court said that the State could not tax

17

sales by the tribe to tribal members of goods for use on

18

the reservation.

19

That was an entirely intertribal operation, and

20

allowing the State to assert its interest there, where it

21

really has no concern, no regulatory concern at all, and

22

no responsibilities, would really threaten to displace the

23

mechanisms of tribal government.

That principle does not apply here, because the

QUESTION:

I'm not sure that I -- maybe it's

obvious, but why is it -- supposing the ski resort

attracts skiers from all over the State, most of whom are

not Indians, and don't they market their tax exemption if
