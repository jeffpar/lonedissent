ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY W. WARREN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. WARREN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
At issue in this case is whether the bankruptcy

12

court presiding over the Celotex Chapter 11 case had

13

jurisdiction to enter an interim stay of execution on

14

supersedeas bonds by judgment creditors of Celotex.

15

That stay restrained the Edwardses from

16

collecting their judgment against Celotex, which was

17

largely for punitive damages from Northbrook, the surety

18

on the supersedeas bond posted for the benefit of Celotex,

19

for the benefit of the Edwardses.

20

The case arises out of the Edwards' admitted

21

collateral attack on the bankruptcy court stay order when

22

they requested under Rule 65.1 that the district court in

23

Texas which had originally presided over their personal

24

injury claim against Celotex granted them permission to

25

enforce the supersedeas bond against Northbrook

notwithstanding the bankruptcy court's stay order.

2

At the time Celotex filed its bankruptcy

3

petition it had posted similar supersedeas bonds in over

4

100 separate appeals using $70 million of assets to secure

5

its obligations to the sureties.

6

over 100,000 personal injury and wrongful death cases, all

7

of which were the result of the same conduct by a

8

predecessor that had merged into Celotex, which was the

9

same basis for the claims of the Edwardses.

10

Celotex was defending

1

the judgment of the Fifth Circuit must be reversed if the

2

bankruptcy court had subject matter jurisdiction to issue

3

its interim stay of the execution upon Celotex'

4

supersedeas bonds.

5

That's the issue in this case.

The statutory basis of the bankruptcy court's

6

subject matter jurisdiction is 28 U.S.C. section 1334(b),

7

which states that the district courts have jurisdiction of

8

all civil proceedings arising under title 11 or arising in

9

or related to cases under title 11.

QUESTION:

Mr. Warren, would you explain how the

11

proceeding on the bond will affect the bankruptcy estate?

12

What are the ways in which it will?

13

has to pay is outside the bankruptcy estate, of course, so

14

how will it affect the bankruptcy estate?

15

MR. WARREN:

The money Northbrook

Justice O'Connor, the way it

16

affects the estate is that Celotex has a contractual

17

relationship with Northbrook that was entered into as part

18

of the posting of the supersedeas bond.

19

To secure that contractual relationship,

20

Celotex, under a settlement agreement that resolved

21

certain insurance coverage disputes with Northbrook,

22

pledged that if Northbrook had to pay a bond it could

23

exercise rights of set-off against the funds that would

24

otherwise be available to Celotex for payment to its

25

creditors, so that although under the -5

QUESTION:

1
2

So what was pledged are funds that

otherwise would be in the general bankruptcy estate.
MR. WARREN:

3

That's correct, Your Honor.

The

4

money that Northbrook would pay to the Edwardses is not

5

subject to the property of the estate.

6

pledged by Celotex to Northbrook is property of the

7

estate, and it's that interconnection that creates the

8

effect.

9

The property

This -QUESTION:

10

Mr. Warren, the estate would get back

11

that property pledged, I assume, only if there's some

12

invalidity in the pledge, is that -MR. WARREN:

13

14
15

16
17

That is absolutely correct, Justice

Scalia.
QUESTION:

Is there thought to be some

invalidity in it?
MR. WARREN:

Yes, Your Honor.

There are two

18

bases upon which Celotex for the benefit of its estate is

19

presently prosecuting adversary proceedings in the

20

bankruptcy court to bring back into, to recover for the

21

benefit of all of its creditors, those funds.

22

The first premise is, is that the vast majority

23

of the Edwards' claim is for punitive damages.

24

of their claim is for punitive damages.

25

principles of equitable subordination codified in section

$245,000

Under the

1

510(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, Celotex is seeking, through

2

the bankruptcy court, to subordinate those claims, which

3

would then invalidate and bring back to the estate those

4

funds that were transferred to Northbrook.

5

The second attack that's been made --

6

QUESTION:

Those claims seeking to bring back

7

those -- the judgment has already been rendered with

8

regard to those claims.

9

MR. WARREN:

That's correct, but it is a

10

judgment for punitive awards which under normal bankruptcy

11

practice would not be recoverable in lieu of the ability

12

to compensate regular compensatory awards.

13

The invalidity of the claim -- the obligation of

14

Northbrook on the judgment to the Edwardses is predicated

15

upon the affirmance by the Fifth Circuit of that judgment.

16

The Bankruptcy Code expressly permits a basis upon which

17

equitable subordination can occur, so that one creditor

18

cannot recover for its benefit claims to the detriment of

19

other creditors if the bankruptcy court finds appropriate

20

grounds for that to occur.

21
22

QUESTION:

infected was the collateral, not the judgment itself?

23

MR. WARREN:

24

QUESTION:

25

Mr. Warren, didn't you say what was

That's correct, Your Honor.
So what would be the basis for

setting aside the transfer from Celotex to Northbrook to

MR. WARREN:

Under the bankruptcy code, the

transfer by Celotex to Northbrook was for the indirect

benefit of the Edwardses.

transfers both direct and indirect can be avoided, and

Northbrook would not stand as a

The Bankruptcy Code contemplates that

QUESTION:

Are you attacking those as

10

preferences, or fraudulent, or -- what's the basis for

11

attacking that transfer?
MR. WARREN:

12

Within the group of bonds there are

13

preferences, there are fraudulent transfers.

14

fraudulent transfers is what is applicable in connection

15

with the Edwards' claim because it is outside the

16

preference period.

17

transfer for the indirect benefit of the Edwardses to

18

Northbrook constituted a fraudulent conveyance,

constructively fraudulent.
Why is it for the indirect benefit of

(800) FOR DEPO

It seems to

1

me it was entirely for the benefit of Celotex, to enable

2

it not to have to pay the judgment.

3

MR. WARREN:

That is the issue, because the --

4

in order to avoid the transfer, Celotex must establish

5

insolvency at the time of the transfer, or insolvency as a

6

result of the transfer, and a lack of reasonably

7

equivalent value in exchange for the transfer.

8

9

Celotex' financial condition, as is evidenced by
the record in the bankruptcy court, which is not before

10

and never was brought to the record that's before this

11

Court coming from the Fifth Circuit, demonstrates that the

12

financial condition of Celotex at the time of these

13

transfers of its assets to the surety was the same as at

14

the time of the filing of its bankruptcy petition, so what

15

the bankruptcy court has done in this case is, it has

16

continued a stay and maintained the status quo using its

17

powers under section 105 --

18

QUESTION:

I'm not concerned with the insolvent

19

status, I give you that, but what conceivable basis is

20

there for arguing that it was not for the benefit of

21

Celotex, which is a necessary condition to say that, you

22

know, that somehow this thing could be called back?

23

MR. WARREN:

Well, that would be the defense

24

that is being raised to the fraudulent conveyance claim.

25

However, constructively fraudulent conveyances where

1

there's a lack of reasonably equivalent value under the

2

bankruptcy code can be called back.

3

And Celotex did not benefit.

Remember, Your

4

Honor, Celotex will never receive any of these funds.

5

will only -- this is a question of allocating limited

6

resources among a few judgment creditors who had the

7

benefit of supersedeas bonds, and hundreds of thousands of

8

other judgment creditors whose claims arise from the exact

9

same conduct.

10

QUESTION:

Well, please help me.

I really don't

11

understand this.

12

insolvency the judgment could have been executed upon?

Isn't it the case that despite Celotex's

MR. WARREN:

Yes, during -- absent the posting

of the supersedeas bond.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. WARREN:

Absent the posting of the bond.
And Your Honor, the issue that is

17

being litigated now is whether the forbearance that is

18

affected by the supersedeas bond is sufficient

19

consideration to meet the reasonably equivalent

20

consideration test in order to -- in order to avoid a

21

constructively fraudulent transfer.

QUESTION:

Mr. Warren, could you help me just

23

with this one very preliminary question?

24

you're arguing the merits of the bankruptcy court's

25

injunction, and I thought your basic position was that

even if the injunction was erroneously entered, you should

wrong, the Fifth Circuit should have recognized that --

that injunction.

QUESTION:

10

I'm merely responding to the inquiries from the

It seems to me the thrust of your

argument is we shouldn't be deciding that, either.
MR. WARREN:

11

That is correct, Your Honor.

We do

12

not think that it is appropriate at this time for this

13

Court to deal with the merits, but only whether or not

14

there was a relationship, a related two-jurisdiction

15

issue.

16

there a nexus between what's occurring with these

17

supersedeas bonds and the estate --

18

Did the bankruptcy court have some connection?

QUESTION:

Is

Your position is that if the

19

Edwardses thought the bankruptcy court was wrong, they

20

should appeal to the eleventh -- the district court in the

21

Eleventh Circuit, not take it up in the Fifth Circuit.

22

MR. WARREN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

The

23

actual stay called for the parties to come first to the

24

bankruptcy court to seek modification.

25

they would have appellate rights to the Eleventh Circuit.

QUESTION:

On that point, I want to ask, was

Northbrook subject to the stay order?

3

run against Northbrook --

4

MR. WARREN:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. WARREN:

Did the stay order

Yes, Your Honor.
Specifically?
Well, in the mass tort context with

7

100,000 the stay order doesn't name anybody specifically.

8

You know, that's the problem that you have logistically,

9

practically with that type of proceeding.

10

The bankruptcy court was confronted at the early

11

stages of the Celotex reorganization with, you know,

12

hundreds and hundreds of appeals, not only these types of

13

appeals, but Celotex was involved in insurance coverage

14

disputes that were rather complex throughout the country,

15

ADR proceedings, all types of administrative and judicial

16

proceedings, so that the court entered this broad stay as

17

a case management mechanism.

18

Subsequently, the court has specified the

19

applicability of the stay and has considered efforts to

20

modify the stay on behalf of all of the bonded claimants.

21

Counsel for the Edwardses came to the court shortly after

22

the bankruptcy case was filed seeking to have the State

23

modify it, and at that time the court clarified, you know,

24

that -- its determination with respect to the status of

25

the supersedeas bond and that it applied even when the

1

appeal had been resolved without effect.
QUESTION:

2

So it comes down to which is the

3

proper circuit, ultimately, to resolve this legal question

4

of whether the appeal bond can be thrown back for the

5

benefit of all the creditors.

6

question of whether it's the Eleventh Circuit or the Fifth

7

Circuit that's going to make that ruling.
MR. WARREN:

8

9

It's just that -- it's a

Yes, Your Honor.

We maintain that

Congress under the Bankruptcy Clause empowered the

10

district court in the Middle District of Florida having

11

jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case filed by the Celotex

12

Corporation to consider all matters that are related to

13

that case.

14

QUESTION:

And would that bar another circuit

15

from reexamining this order if there were -- because

16

there's colorable jurisdiction to issue it?

17

assertion was that there was a patent jurisdictional

18

defect.

19

suppose it were, would that bar the Fifth Circuit from

20

making this inquiry?

21

Suppose the

I don't think that assertion is made here, but

MR. WARREN:

No, Your Honor.

We would agree

22

that if there was a patent jurisdictional defect, then the

23

collateral attack rule would have an exception that would

24

permit the Fifth Circuit to -- or the district court in

25

Texas to consider the matter.

1

QUESTION:

So is your position here that there

2

is no patent defect, that there is at least colorable

3

jurisdiction, and that that's the end of the matter?

4

MR. WARREN:

That's correct, Your Honor,

5

although I think that it has -- I think it's appropriate

6

that the court that issued -- I think it's good public

7

policy that the court that issues an injunction, that has

8

colorable jurisdiction to enter that injunction, should -you know, a party should respect and obey that injunction.

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Warren, at this point, mustn't we

11

decide more than colorable, because at least in the forum

12

where the appeal bond was lodged, that's a mechanical

13

procedure, ordinarily.

14

You called it - you said everyone agreed that in

15

the Fifth Circuit there was a collateral attack on the

16

bankruptcy court's stay order, but in fact what there was

17

was a motion under the Federal rules to realize the

18

judgment against the appeal bond.

1

It wasn't a separate proceeding collaterally

20

attacking the stay in the bankruptcy court, so it's not

21

like a little jurisdiction.

22

bankruptcy court have subject matter jurisdiction?

23

either does or it doesn't.

24
25

MR. WARREN:

The question is, does the
It

I agree with that, Your Honor, that

either the bankruptcy court had subject matter

1

jurisdiction, or the bankruptcy court did not have subject

2

matter jurisdiction.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. WARREN:

And you're relying on 105 for that?
No, Your Honor, we rely on 1334(b)

5

for the subject matter jurisdiction of the bankruptcy

6

court.

7

QUESTION:

So we have to make a detailed

8

inquiry, or the Fifth Circuit is entitled to make a

9

detailed inquiry, into the jurisdiction under 1334?

10

MR. WARREN:

Your Honor, I think that they were

11

entitled to look at the jurisdiction that was asserted by

12

the bankruptcy court, and finding that jurisdiction exists

13

in the bankruptcy court, then they should have deferred to

14

the stay that was entered by that court unless and until

15

it was modified on direct appeal.

16

QUESTION:

So you're saying that jurisdiction

17

existed if there was a colorable claim that the property

18

could come into the estate, and this is where I find I

19

have difficulty.

20

long as the property used to belong to the bankrupt.

21

22

23

You're saying it is a colorable claim so

MR. WARREN:

Your Honor, it's more than just

property -QUESTION:

You're saying that even without --

24

without any assertion of facts that would somehow

25

demonstrate that there's a real possibility that the

1

property could be included within the bankruptcy estate,

2

even without that, it is still related to --

3

MR. WARREN:

Yes, Your Honor.

The circuit court

4

test with respect to related-to jurisdiction, which is a

5

broad definition, and Congress intended it to be broadly

6

construed as part of the uniformity associated with

7

bankruptcy matters, intended that the bankruptcy court, or

8

the district court exercising bankruptcy jurisdiction have

9

broad jurisdiction.

10

QUESTION:

11

It doesn't say, might be related to.

It says, related to.

12

MR. WARREN:

13

QUESTION:

That'S
Isn't it reasonable to interpret that

14

to mean that there must be some facts that would give rise

15

to a colorable claim that the money can be recovered by

16

the bankrupt estate?

17

MR. WARREN:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. WARREN:

Absolutely, Your Honor, but -And what are they here?
Well, the facts are that the

20

transfers made by the Celotex Corporation were made at a

21

time when it was insolvent.

22

the time of these events, there was no consideration that

23

was increased to the Celotex estate.

QUESTION:

The facts are that the -- at

the bonding company pays out on the bond.

2

MR. WARREN:

3

QUESTION:

Once -- well -Isn't -- I guess I have the same

4

question.

5

there were no attack on these bonds, isn't it your

6

position that the bankruptcy court would still have

7

jurisdiction to enter an injunction against realizing on

8

the bond?

9

Isn't your claim broader than that?

MR. WARREN:

Even if

Absolutely, Your Honor, because it

10

protects the reorganization process, and that is precisely

11

why the collateral attack by the Fifth Circuit should not

12

be condoned.

So that the only --

jurisdictionally relevant fact that you have to establish

is that, if in fact the Edwardses realized on the bond,

there would be a consequence to the bankruptcy estate,

MR. WARREN:

Had there been no supersedeas bond,

That would be one.

The other would

be if we can equitably subordinate the punitive award that

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

11

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
Our position in this case is that the Fifth

12

Circuit properly declined to follow the bankruptcy court's

stay order because the bankruptcy court lacked

14

jurisdiction to stay proceedings by the Edwardses against

15

Northbrook, and I would respond to a comment that Justice

16

Kennedy made earlier, we are claiming a patent

17

jurisdictional defect in the stay order, which was issued

18

5 days after the bankruptcy.

We are claiming that the bankruptcy court had no

is a limit on that -- on the relationship, on the degree

13

to which a bankruptcy court can exercise jurisdiction over

proceedings which are tangentially related to a

For example, in the Pacor case, the plaintiff

sued a defendant, the defendant sued a codefendant for

indemnity, that codefendant went into Chapter 11, Pacor

19

argued, well, this proceeding -- the plaintiff's

proceeding against us is a proceeding related to the

bankruptcy of the codefendant because the -- if the

Isn't it

the punitive recoveries, it might have gone into

MR. ROSENTHAL:

I think the question implicates

two issues, one is the possible success of the avoidance

really has nothing to do with our claim against

And I think that the underlying purpose of a

8

relationship with the bankruptcy, a tangential one, but

9

the Court held there was no jurisdiction in that case, and

20
21

that's under the broadest test that's been articulated.
In the Lemco case decided by this Court, one of

22

the alternative grounds for the holding was that the

proceedings was unlikely to impair the bankruptcy court's

and I suggest that's exactly the same situation here.
Northbrook's actions may affect the property of

the estate, although I even doubt that, because I think

4

the likelihood of avoiding the transfer is infinitesimal,

5

and I think that the avoidance claims were textual, but

that's Northbrook v. Celotex.

Northbrook does not affect the debtor's estate any more

than the plaintiff's claim against Pacor in the Pacor

situation of the Edwardses then?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

2

Well, the Edwardses would be

3

stayed by the automatic stay.

The circuit courts are

4

uniform on that, and we have not challenged that, because

5

the proceeding is against Celotex.

6

is in appeal, the proceeding is against Celotex, not the

7

bond company.

As long as the matter

8

The difference in this case was, the appeal was

9

decided, the case was over, and the Edwardses had a right

10

to execution and had a -- had a, basically a retroactive

11

right to collect on the judgment, retroactive to when they

12

got the judgment, which was a year and a half before the

13

bankruptcy, and a year and a half ago the bond was posted

at that time as well.

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Well --

If any.
-- several claimants who argue a

right to their bonds have filed a motion to lift the stay

13

to execute on their bonds, and they did this -- I can't

reported in the Joint Appendix, and that, I believe an

the response is, go to the bankruptcy court and litigate

in the bankruptcy court.

3

QUESTION:

That dishonors the transaction.

But again, you would agree that if

4

the injunction is ultimately upheld -- say if the Fifth

5

Circuit decision stands, too, don't you run some risk of

6

being held in contempt of court ultimately and punished

7

for that?

8

MR. ROSENTHAL:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

Yes, Your Honor, we do.

And you're willing to take that risk,

in effect.
MR. ROSENTHAL:

Yes, and again I think that fact

12

illustrates, or refutes the claim that attacks such as

13

these will proliferate, or affirmance of the Fifth

14

Circuit's decision will encourage persons to make these

15

kinds of attacks on bankruptcy court orders.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Rosenthal, isn't that unseemly in

17

the Federal system this should go -- be settled in one

18

place or another and then to have the risk of contempt

19

because the Edwardses are resisting the authority of the

20

courts within the Eleventh Circuit, to say that what has

21

happened in Fifth Circuit is okay but that can be checked

22

later on through contempt proceedings -- for the smooth

23

functioning of a Federal system, shouldn't it be clear

24

that either you're right or Mr. Warren is right about the

authority of the courts within the Eleventh Circuit?

In a case of what we believe to be patent

excursion beyond jurisdictional limits, we say that this

5

procedure is appropriate, that the checks on the ability,

7

make, these kinds of parties to make these kinds of

8

collateral attacks, are the availability of contempt

9

proceedings, and the district court and Fifth Circuit that

10

receives the challenge, they were fully aware of the

11

bankruptcy court's stay order at the time that this issue

12

was litigated, the district court and the Fifth Circuit

13

both.

14

We didn't hide it.

We said, the bankruptcy

15

court has attempted to stay execution but we don't believe

16

that it has jurisdiction to do this, and that was

litigated, and both the district court and the Fifth

out in the Eleventh Circuit and not in the Fifth Circuit?

4

The question is, was there authority in the bankruptcy

court in Florida, in the district court in Florida.

6

MR. ROSENTHAL:

And my answer to that would be

7

no, and again, I'm sure that if we thought that it was a

8

close question, we wouldn't have pursued this challenge,

9

but I don't believe it is a close question.

I don't

10

believe that there is a risk of the Eleventh Circuit

11

finding jurisdiction of any kind in the bankruptcy court

12

to stay these kinds of unrelated proceedings.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Warren, if I hear you correctly,

14

you are not arguing that there is no possibility -- no

realistic possibility, no argument, that Northbrook cannot

Mr. Rosenthal, on rehearing, the

Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in its amendment

is, we're not reversing an order of a court in another

2

circuit over which we don't have jurisdiction, we're just

3

affirming a decision below, because I think that language

4

is in response to statements made in the petition for

5

rehearing that you're effectively reversing an order in

6

another circuit, and I think that was to respond to that.

7

But I do think that the bankruptcy court's

8

order, to the extent that it assumed that there was

9

jurisdiction to do this, was necessarily wrong.

If the

10

bankruptcy court was right in assuming jurisdiction over

11

the bond, then I don't think that the Fifth Circuit could

12

have ruled the way it did.

13

QUESTION:

It's accurate enough to say that the

order did conflict with the bankruptcy court's order, and

2

was delicate in its language saying, no, you don't have

3

the power to do this.

4

I do want to emphasize that, to the extent that

5

the order could be connected in any way with the adversary

6

proceedings, to the extent that Celotex has a -- or claims

7

an interest in the property because of the adversary

8

proceeding, we've said in our brief that we think that

9

would be patently frivolous.

10

I would reiterate that, and add that the

11

bankruptcy -- to the extent that the order staying

12

enforcement on bonds generally is an injunctive order, it

13

did not comply with the requirements of Rule 65, there's

14

no showing of a likelihood of success in the avoidance

action and Celotex did not even attempt to show a

16

likelihood of success.

QUESTION:

Does that court have jurisdiction?

mean, supposing a court with conceded jurisdiction, say a

Federal court with diversity jurisdiction under the

To the extent that it's issued under the

jurisdiction to do that.

13

To the extent that it's related, or attempted to

If it had been your

You are perfectly willing to entertain the

possibility that Northbrook will pay the bond and then get

left high and dry at the other end of the transaction by

16

It seems to me that the whole purpose of this

dealing with the broad jurisdictional question under

MR. ROSENTHAL:

So we're hearing from

My understanding of Northbrook's

4

position is they've opposed the -- they've defended the

5

avoidance action in Florida and in fact characterized the

6

bankruptcy court's injunction or stay order in this case

7

as novel, which I think is strong language from an

insurance --

QUESTION:

That's quite different from saying

10

they haven't got a colorable basis for the claim, that

11

there is no -- in the bankruptcy court there's no

12

colorable basis to set aside the transfer to the insurer.

13

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Yes, but I would, Your Honor.

14

say that there is no colorable basis.

a year before, or more than a year before a bankruptcy,

that pays a debt, pays a judgment, or secures a judgment

bankruptcies do strange things.

This case does not

present an Alice in Wonderland.

It is involving a

substantial amount of money, a substantial amount of

issues.
What the bankruptcy court has done has preserved

The heart of our appeal, and the reason

QUESTION:

10

It hasn't preserved the status quo.

11

The status quo is that every -- that this money was gone.

12

The status quo is that once the security was posted, the

13

case was lost on appeal, that money was gone, and it seems

to me it's saying no, the money isn't gone.

MR. WARREN:

Well, Your Honor, it maintains the

17

status quo in the sense that the funds are still

18

available, the obligation of Northbrook as a surety is

19

still available, the right and entitlements and the

20

avoidance powers as they exist are still available with

21

respect to the estate, and the passage of time that has

22

occurred, the bankruptcy court has provided adequate

23

protection to ensure that segregated funds exist for the

24

benefit of any impairment that occurs as a result of the

25

delays.

QUESTION:

MR. WARREN:

It is gone unless there's some

colorable basis for getting it back.

7

MR. WARREN:

That is correct, Your Honor, and

8

there's two colorable bases that are being litigated now

that exist, the constructively fraudulent transfer, which

10

is a 4-year statute of limitations under Florida law,

which has been established as being the law controlling

this transfer, so it's within the statute of limitations,

no question that Celotex was insolvent at the time it

transferred the assets to Northbrook, there's no question

that the transfer was for the indirect benefit of the
