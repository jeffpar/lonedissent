ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. WINSTON BRYANT

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER BRYANT
GENERAL BRYANT:

10
11

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice

and may it please the Court:
The State of Arkansas is before this Court today

12

13

defending its constitutional authority to encourage

14

rotation in office of its congressional delegation.

15

Amendment 73, which would have accomplished that objective

16

was ruled unconstitutional by the Arkansas supreme court.

17

The court held that Amendment 73 amounted to a

18

qualification and, further, that the State of Arkansas

19

could not add additional qualifications to those listed in

20

Article I, sections 2 and 3.

21

ruling.

22

We disagree with that

Amendment 73 is not a qualification, but even if

23

it is a qualification, the State of Arkansas has the

24

authority to add additional qualifications to those listed

25

in Article I, sections 2 and 3.

Our Founding Fathers envisioned a Congress of

1
2

citizen legislators who would serve awhile, return and mix

3

with the people, and not stay in office indefinitely, and

4

during the 18th and 19th Centuries, voluntary rotation was

5

a common practice.
During the 20th Century, we have seen a dramatic

6

7

increase in the number of long-term, entrenched

8

incumbents.

9

system that is less fair, less competitive, and less

10

Entrenched incumbency makes for an electoral

representative.
Amendment 73 was adopted in 1992 by the people

11
12

of Arkansas overwhelmingly, by a 60 percent to 40 percent

13

maj ority.

14

Twenty-two States now have some form of term

15

limit proposals or ballot access initiatives on their

16

books.

17

the terms of the executive branch officials of those

18

States or the legislative branch officials of those

19

States.

20

Thirty-seven States have term limits that limit

QUESTION:

Is the theory that by this rotation

21

the policy that the legislators adopt will be different in

22

one system than in the other system?

23
24
25

That is to say, are there policy implications to
electing an incumbent as opposed to a nonincumbent?
GENERAL BRYANT:

Yes, Your Honor, that is

correct.
That issue is not before this Court, however,

2
3

but the people of Arkansas, by Amendment 73, have decided

4

to encourage rotation in office to make the election

5

process more fair and more competitive.

6

QUESTION:

7

rationale for the limitation,

8

that rationale is that rotated representatives will vote

9

differently than incumbents would have, would shape public

10

Well, but you're explaining the
and I'm asking if part of

policy in a different way.
GENERAL BRYANT:

11

Your Honor,

they would be more

12

beholden to the people under the theory of Amendment 73

13

because they would not be career politicians.

14

be more responsive to the people.

15

QUESTION:

They would

So there would be a difference in the

16

kind and the shape and the policies of the legislation

17

that they would enact.

18

GENERAL BRYANT:

There could be, Your Honor.

19

QUESTION:

is that the justification for

20

the rule,

21

22
23

Well,

or isn't it?
GENERAL BRYANT:

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes, Your

Honor.
Amendment 73 provides for strict term limits for

24

certain State elected officials in Arkansas.

25

ballot access to multiterm congressional incumbents, but

It denies

1

does allow those incumbents, after serving a maximum

2

number of terms allowed by Amendment 73, to run as a

3

write-in candidate.

4

QUESTION:

5

But once they're denied the ballot

access, they're denied it for life, is that right?

6

GENERAL BRYANT:

7

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

Doesn't the permanency of the denial

8

carry a suggestion of what we would normally refer to as a

9

qualification?

10

GENERAL BRYANT:

No, Your Honor.

The definition

11

of a ballot access proposal like Amendment 73 as opposed

12

to a qualification is put forth in our brief, and that is,

13

a qualification is something that absolutely prohibits a

14

candidate from serving even if elected.

15

QUESTION:

Well, I realize that's your position,

16

but in any case, your position would take us beyond

17

Storer, wouldn't it?

18

GENERAL BRYANT:

19

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.

Well, in Storer -- maybe my

20

recollection is wrong.

In Storer, I thought there wasn't

21

a lifetime disqualification.

22

GENERAL BRYANT:

23

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

I mean, if you -- you know, had been

24

party-affiliated within a certain period of time, you

25

couldn't be there as an independent, but the next election

was coming, and that was a new day.

2

Storer?

3

GENERAL BRYANT:

4

QUESTION:

Isn't that right, in

That is correct, Your Honor.

So Storer didn't have that

5

implication of permanence which is in fact a feature of

6

the Arkansas system.

7

GENERAL BRYANT:

That is correct, Your Honor,

8

but the State's position is that Amendment 73 is

9

consistent with Storer, the difference being that under

10

Amendment 73 a candidate can actually serve a couple of

11

terms in the Senate, or three terms in the House, so it

12

does not absolutely prohibit a candidate from serving.

13

After that candidate reaches a maximum number of terms,

14

then obviously that candidate is denied access to the

15

ballot.

16

QUESTION:

General --

17

QUESTION:

-- precedent, any case where a group

18

based on past experience, past lawful experience, has been

19

categorically hobbled in this way.

handicap in the race if the only access they have is as a

21

write-in, is it?

22

GENERAL BRYANT:

It's not simply a

Your Honor, to answer your

23

question, the State does not take the position that

24

Amendment 73 is an absolute handicap, because we're

25

dealing with multiterm incumbents who would have great

1

name recognition, resources available to them that

2

ordinary challenges would not have.

3

QUESTION:

I'm trying to contrast a mere

4

handicap from a hobbling, and it seems to me this falls in

5

the latter category.

6

GENERAL BRYANT:

No, Your Honor.

The State's

7

position is that Amendment 73 will allow a candidate to

8

serve even if elected, and under that scenario, under that

9

definition that we put forth to this Court, would amount

10
11

to only a ballot access regulation.
QUESTION:

Well, General Bryant, a good many

12

States have passed so-called term limit measures that just

13

disable a candidate from appearing on the ballot for a

14

short period of time, isn't that correct?

15

GENERAL BRYANT:

16

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

And Arkansas has a very different

17

provision in that it extends for the rest of that

18

particular candidate's life.

19

GENERAL BRYANT:

20

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

Do you think that there may well be,

21

even if you are correct that it is seen as a ballot access

22

measure, that there may be First Amendment issues at stake

23

here, the associational rights, for instance, of the

24

political party that might want to have the candidate on

25

the ballot as its candidate?

GENERAL BRYANT:

Yes, Your Honor, there are --

QUESTION:

3

resolved in the courts below?

And are those issues issues that were

4

GENERAL BRYANT:

5

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.

So that would be open on remand, I

6

assume, even if we agreed with you it were a ballot access

7

measure?

10

GENERAL BRYANT:

That is correct, Your Honor.

That is correct.
QUESTION:

Those -- you say the First Amendment

11

issue were presented to the supreme court of Arkansas but

12

not decided by it.

13

GENERAL BRYANT:

That is correct, Your Honor.

14

Amendment 73 is also consistent with this Court's

15

jurisprudence.

16

In Burdick v. Takushi, a case from Hawaii, in

17

that particular case, the State of Hawaii had adopted a

18

statutory scheme that allowed write-in voting to be

19

completely banned.

20
21

QUESTION:

In this -Yes, and what about a State like

Hawaii that has no write-in voting allowed at all?

22

GENERAL BRYANT:

23

QUESTION:

24

GENERAL BRYANT:

25

Your Honor --

Would it become a qualification then?
It would become a qualification

at that point, if there is no write-in provision, but even

assuming -QUESTION:

2

How is that?

I'm not sure how that

3

makes it a qualification.

4

whether it's a qualification is whether, when a person has

5

been supposedly elected and reports to Congress, Congress

6

can sit in judgment and say, this person is not qualified.

7

Now, if that should happen, what disqualification would

8

there be?

It seems to me the test for

GENERAL BRYANT:

Your Honor, under that

10

scenario, Congress can consider the -- obviously can

11

consider under Article I, section 5, the qualifications,

12

and under the position of the State in this particular

13

case, a pure write-in, a pure term limits proposal --

QUESTION:

Let's assume in Hawaii the person

gets on the ballot by mistake, or in Arkansas.

Now, could

Congress sit in judgment and exclude that person?
GENERAL BRYANT:

GENERAL BRYANT:

Your Honor, I was considering

it under a pure term limits proposal.

I'm not talking about --

GENERAL BRYANT:

7

QUESTION:

Under Amendment --

I'm talking about, Hawaii exclusion

8

from the ballot system.

9

it's just exclusion from the ballot, but entirely.

10

write-in allowed, either, and the Arkansas system.

11

It's not a term limit proposal,

GENERAL BRYANT:

No

And under the Arkansas system,

12

Your Honor, the Congress could not consider the Amendment

13

73 proposal as a qualification under that scenario.

14

QUESTION:

It seems to me they couldn't with

respect to Hawaii, either.

17

and people will not be able to vote for you.

That is correct.

And if that happens, you're not

unqualified.

QUESTION:

2

If it's time, place, and manner, this

3

means, of course, that the current Congress, composed

4

mainly of incumbents, can simply revise the Arkansas law,

5

right?

6

GENERAL BRYANT:

7

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

And indeed, the current Congress

8

could revise those laws that don't provide for term

9

limitations or don't provide for exclusion from ballot

10

access to incumbents.

11

GENERAL BRYANT:

Yes, Your Honor,

What could the Federal legislature

do?
GENERAL BRYANT:

The Federal legislature, Your

20

Honor, is given authority under Article I, section 4, to

21

override anything the States do in the area.

22

QUESTION:

Yes, but are you suggesting that it

could do -- the Federal legislature could do anything more

24

than simply negate a State regulation?

Yes, Your Honor.

Article I, section 4 would give

Yes, Your Honor.

And what part of the language is it

of that section that -GENERAL BRYANT:

The term "manner," Your Honor,

11

under Article I, section 4, has a very broad, expansive

12

meaning, and during the ratification debates the States

13

were concerned about the fact that under Article I,

14

section 4, Congress was being given the authority which

15

the States concluded would allow Congress to override

16

anything the States did in the area.

17

The Article I, section 4 clause was sold on the

18

basis that Congress needed the authority or power to

19

preserve its -- the Union, if necessary, and so Article I,

20

section 4 has a -- is very broad in its meaning, and would

21

authorize Congress to adopt legislation in the area.

22

QUESTION:

So that even though, perhaps, a State

23

hasn't acted, Congress could, by law, make regulations

24

governing the time, place, and manner?

Yes, Your Honor, and in fact

Congress could override amendment 73 if Congress so

desired.
QUESTION:

3

But what if Arkansas had made no

4

provision for term limits at all, could Congress step in

5

and make a provision for term limits?
GENERAL BRYANT:

Article I, section 4, Congress could do that.
QUESTION:

10
11

Yes, Your Honor, under

You've mentioned that there were

qualifications that don't come from the Constitution
itself.
You started out your argument by saying the

12

States could add qualifications.

13

there are only two categories, there's qualifications, and

14

there's time, place, and manner, but you see two

15

categories of qualifications, I gather, because you've

16

told us that some come from the Constitution, and then

17

there are others the States can add.

18

Now you've told us that

So what's the category of qualifications, extra-

19

Constitution, that the State can add that are not time,

20

place, and manner regulations?

21

GENERAL BRYANT:

Your Honor, the qualifications

22

that the States could add would all be time, place, and

23

manner under Article I, section 4.

24

if there are some enumerated -- if Article I, section 4

25

does not cover some particular areas, Amendment 10 would

allow the States to act in that particular area, but the

States have always added additional qualifications.
In fact, when the Constitution was adopted by

the States, the State of Virginia had a property

qualification as well as a residency requirement.

GENERAL BRYANT:

under the Constitution we think there are two things, two

semantic, two juridical categories, one qualifications and

the other time, place, and manner.

that term limit is a qualification, we are exploring

10

whether or not the Congress could override that, and you

say, oh, well, they can go under section 4, but we've just

stipulated this is a qualification, and that doesn't apply

13

to section 4.

GENERAL BRYANT:

there something very odd in a scheme in which the -- we'll

conditions known as qualifications would be left entirely

GENERAL BRYANT:

That is correct, Your Honor.

12

Under the jurisprudence of this Court, ballot access

jurisprudence, the States can erect barriers or

14

limitations to limit the field of candidates, and so long

15

as that passes constitutional muster, then the States have

the authority to do that.

2

to that has to begin by looking at the sources of power of

3

Congress and of the States, and they are very different.

4

I think the answer

Congress has power only insofar as it is granted

5

in the Constitution, and the only grant of power to

6

Congress to legislate in this area has to come from

7

Article I, section 4, or, I quickly amend, the Necessary

8

and Proper Clause, which is also part of Article I,

9

section 4, and nowadays section 5 of the Fifteenth

10

Amendment, which has received a very, very broad

11

interpretation, and I don't think that we need to address

12

that at this time, but we recognize that that's very

13

broad.

14

The sources of power of the State are very, very

15

different, and particularly when you have legislation, a

16

constitutional amendment that the people of Arkansas

17

adopted and imposed on themselves.

not, for the following reason.
I would say, in the first instance, if you take

the words of Article I, section 4, "make or alter," and

4

say that those are of equal force, and I'm not sure that

5

you have to do that at all, I would say Congress has the

6

power to knock out any State law with respect to elections

7

that Congress doesn't like.

8

that's why Article I, section 4 was put in the

9

Constitution.

It's very, very clear that

And -- but I submit that my theory

2

of the Constitution, Justice Scalia, has historical

3

validity and makes sense when you -QUESTION:

4

Under your theory, Mr. Kester, could

5

Congress say that no person shall be a Senator who is not

6

over the age of 25 and have that the controlling

7

qualification?
MR. KESTER:

8

9

I -- if Congress or the States

passed a law that was absolutely flat-out contrary to

10

those provisions in Article I, if they've made it contrary

11

to it, then that would be unconstitutional just on the

12

face of it.
QUESTION:

13

How about saying no person over 50,

14

under 50, saying -- you know, Congress obviously was --

15

the Framers were concerned about age, 35, and you know,

16

we're also concerned about age.

17

Could that override the 35-year-old provision?

18

MR. KESTER:

We think it should be 50.

I think there you've got

19

legislation going right at the heart of provisions that

20

were put in the Constitution, and it could be that those

21

are minimum qualifications, or it could be that they could

22

be enhanced with respect to age or district residence.

I'll defer to Your Honor on that.
Mr. Kester, let's take an age -- you

can't run after the age of 70, instead of upping the age

from 35, a mandatory retirement.

out of your Equal Protection problem?

MR. KESTER:

Wouldn't that get you

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it

My theory of the Constitution, which I think is

24

qualifications that may not be supplemented by either

2

Congress or the States, and that it gives both the States

3

and Congress the power to set time, place, and manner

4

regulations so as to assure fair and orderly elections,

5

but that that is an essentially procedural power, leaving

6

the people at each election to choose whom they please to

7

govern them.
QUESTION:

8

9

then, Mr. Cohen?

Why didn't they put it differently,

The briefs here have been referring to

10

this as a qualifications clause.

It's really not a

11

qualifications clause, it's a disqualifications clause.

12

They could have said, every person shall be

13

eligible to serve in the House of Representatives who

14

shall attain to the age of 25 years, shall have been 7

15

years a citizen of the United States, and shall not when

6

I agree that the constitutional --

I agree that the constitutional text

doesn't resolve the issue because it phrases it that way.
One reason why it may phrase it that way is

7
8

because there are other disqualifications in the

9

Constitution itself, and there was contemplation, of

10

course, of further possible disqualifications, but when

11

Madison and Hamilton came to explain what the Constitution

12

did, when the House Committee on Elections in 1807 studied

13

the meaning of that clause, they concluded that the

14

intention was to make those qualifications exclusive.

this Court reviewed this history in the Powell case

question that was being voted on on the floor of the

19

convention was whether to give Congress the power to add a

property qualification or to add other qualifications.

This Court said on that day the Court faced and

rejected the possibility that the legislature -- and it

MR. COHEN:

QUESTION:

MR. COHEN:

explaining how the Constitution had fixed both the

rests on the proposition that the qualifications were

fixed in the Constitution and could not be supplemented

QUESTION:

Well, I think you're mistaken on

10

that, Mr. Cohen.

11

that a single House of Congress cannot add to the

The holding of Powell clearly has to be

Yes, but as this Court explained in

an aspect of the judging power as such, it was the fact

that the -- or that Article I, section 2, fixed

17

qualifications that could be applied.

18

There are two questions here.

One is, vis-a-

19

vis Congress, are we talking only about a judging power,

20

or are we also talking about the power to legislate

21

additional qualifications?

22

argument that was made in Powell goes to the power to

legislate, not to the power to judge, although the

ultimate question was only whether Congress could judge.

MR. COHEN:

The ultimate holding, I agree, but

3

the logical foundation was that, and it then seems to me

that the extension to the States is straightforward.

in Powell were State additions of qualifications, or

7

attempts by States to add qualifications.

With respect to the States, that is not true.

MR. COHEN:

I'm only saying that I think

Powell did dispose of additional qualifications.

not clear and dispositive constitutional text as a

that it is preclusive vis-a-vis Congress and not

preclusive vis-a-vis the States.

But I think this is not a Tenth Amendment case,

Well, Mr. Cohen, we have Storer, for

impose a qualification, if you will, could be saved on the

MR. COHEN:

It's orderly elections.

Now, it's quite different from -- it's -- if I

10

can use a metaphor, it's like the difference between

11

saying that someone must run in his assigned, qualifying

12

heat in order to get into the finals of the 100-yard dash,

13

and saying that somebody who won the medal last time must

start 50 yards behind the others because we want to pass

the medals around.

16

One involves procedural regulation that the

Constitution authorizes the States to do, and the other

involves a State substantive preference for one class of

If you read, particularly the Federalist 59 and

Now, petitioners aren't very clear, to say the

least, about whether the State's supposed power here is --

7

they're not very clear is that neither argument works.

I suggest the reason that

The Constitution explicitly gives Congress the
superior power to make election regulations or to alter

10

those of the States, but it plainly, in doing so, means to

11

limit the power of both the States and Congress to

12

procedural matters.

13

It seems to me that the argument that a State

14

can impose ballot access restrictions under some power

15

outside the Time, Place, and Manner Clause is answered in

16

the clause itself, which contains the phrase, "make or

17

alter," and incidentally, the primary reason for that

18

phrase was a fear that the States might not set up the

19

machinery for congressional elections at all, and so the

20

"make" part of the "make or alter" phrase is an important

21

part of it.

22

The convention deliberately gave Congress the

power to make or alter State regulations because Hamilton

MR. COHEN:

I think for a State to say, on the whole we

don't think people over 70 ought to continue to serve

keep them off the ballot, but if they can win by a write-

10

That's right.

That's right.

So it is a third something-or-other,

That's right.

I think that is not a valid time, place,

I also would not urge that anyone call it a

merely keeping someone off the ballot.

2

MR. COHEN:

3

QUESTION:

Yes.
And then you say -- and then you say,

4

and this is so like a qualification that it must be

5

invalid.

6

Is that -MR. COHEN:

Yes, but I also say -- but I also

7

say that even if it is not a qualification, it is

8

something that the States have no power to do, because the

9

States have, as Congress has, only the power that is

10

granted to them under the Time, Place, and Manner Clause,

11

and the Time, Place, and Manner Clause does not -- and the

12

Time, Place, and Manner Clause does not authorize States

13

to draw this kind of substantive distinction in the course

14

of setting procedures for elections.

15

QUESTION:

I take it your position is, is that

16

the State can require, or the State can be forbidden from

17

requiring its officeholders to have the same

18

qualifications as its electors?

19

MR. COHEN:

Yes.

I think it's clear that the

determine the qualifications of officeholders, of Federal

officeholders.

Yes, because one is a matter of the

State's business, and the other is not, not for running

There was a period of time when I was qualified

Mr. Cohen, what about a law that just

14

I think -Do you make exactly the same

Do you make no distinction between such a law
That is, a lifetime inability?

MR. COHEN:

I make a distinction, but the

15

distinction I would draw is that it seems to me the

16

lifetime inability demonstrates the falsity of the

17

suggestion that this has something to do with incumbents.

18

I think that a bar for a single election would

19

run afoul of the same principle that I am asserting here,

20

It's difficult for me to draw a clear line from what you

MR. COHEN:

Well, there may be some difficult

5

cases in drawing lines.

6

to wrestle with whether a sound limitation on a rock band

7

was a time, place, and manner limitation or, as a applied

8

to that band, a content limitation.

9

In the speech area the Court had

This is a clear case.

This is an easy case.

10

The Court has -- the State has singled out people based on

11

a personal characteristic, and if they can do this under

12

the Time, Place, and Manner Clause, Congress could under

13

the Time, Place, and Manner Clause, it seems to me, keep

14

off the ballot for the Senate anybody who hasn't served in

15

the House, and so on.

16

The State has singled out for this burden people

17

based on a substantive qualification that does not relate,

a substantive characteristic that does not relate to the

election process or their compliance with reasonable

procedures established by the State under its power under

the practice that has been engaged in from the time when

12

the Constitution was written, and there have, indeed, been

13

a considerable number of State additional qualifications,

I guess the most common being that in order to run for

MR. COHEN:

District resident qualifications

They're the sort of thing that a

QUESTION:

The Constitution gave the Federal

Government only delegated powers to govern people's lives

comprehensively with filling the offices that the

There's an overall design to give We, the

People, every 2 years the power to select who will

qualifications and reasonable, fundamentally procedural

19

regulations that the State has given power to adopt

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

I want to reinforce the extraordinary and

That is correct, but I think that

history that it found in Powell v. McCormack, and much of

the evidence that's been brought forward was addressed by

3

have to remember that the power there is one shared

coextensively by Congress.

5

*

Where does that lead the petitioners with

6

respect to their arguments?

7

then the States may add, and the Congress may add.

8

that's what they're relying upon, this creates an

9

interesting situation that I think Justice Scalia and

10

1

They seem to rely principally upon the times,

If it is a qualification,
If

Justice Souter were alluding to.

11

That is, if the States can set qualifications,

12

then presumably, under Article I section 5, Congress can

13

judge those qualifications not against the constitutional,

14

textual qualifications, but the potentially myriad

15

qualifications that States could * set up along the lines of

16

the ones that have been provided by Amendment 73.

17

If it is a manner, then the States may bar

18

access to the ballot, but Congress also may bar access to

19

the ballot, and it is not a power in Congress that has to

20

await action by the States.

21

which suggests that in the absence of any action by the

22

States, Congress on its own could impose the same types of

23

requirements that Amendment 73 imposes.

The term is "make or alter,"

But we would suggest that this is not a manner.
This is not times, places, and manner.

qualification.

With due respect to my cocounsel, I think

2

it's unavoidable that this is a qualification.
Let me suggest why that is so.

3

First of all,

4

the times, places, and manner requirement, as my cocounsel

5

has set out, was designed to ensure the fairness and the

6

efficiency and the accuracy of the legislative process,

7

the electoral process.
Justice Ginsburg, you pointed out that in our

8

First Amendment jurisprudence it is a procedural cast that

10

the Court has given to the concept of time, place, and

11

manner.
QUESTION:

12

13

And I believe listed the language

from section 4.

14

GENERAL DAYS:

Yes.

I always wondered where

15

that came from, and now, with further study, I understand

16

that.

17

But how do we know it's a qualification as

opposed to a manner?

19

question.

question, and I think the answer lies in the fact that

Storer v. Brown was focused on one election cycle.

That is, the burdens that were imposed upon the

Somehow his name gets on the Arkansas ballot accidentally,

by a mistake or by some corrupt act, and he gets elected,

judge his qualifications.

If Congress can rely only upon

the textual qualifications, then they cannot exclude him.

GENERAL DAYS:

Justice Stevens, I think this

restates divisions of authority that are provided

elsewhere in the Constitution, and the very idea that the

Tenth Amendment could give the States the power somehow to

fill in the gaps with respect to the Federal structure

19

when we're talking about provisions that do not grant

Congress explicitly the power to address them, or deny to

21

the States explicit power to deal with them, that somehow

the Tenth Amendment provides that power.

But why, then, isn't it okay to

Yes.

Well, there's a temporal quality

11

here.

The requirement with respect to being a member of

12

the party, or if you wanted to run as an independent, not

13

being a member of a party, is related to the integrity of

14

the electoral process, and it focuses on that election

cycle.

16

The people who were disqualified in Storer can,

17

in the next election cycle, prepare themselves to qualify

according to the rules of California.

that Justice Scalia, you talked about the disqualification

'

This Court in Powell canvassed the history of

that particular formulation and locution, and I think what

the Court concluded was, it was done by the Committee of

Style, and the Committee of Style had no authority to

change the substance, and indeed, during that period it

14

was quite often the case that alternative formulations

First

1

Under that scenario, it is the State's position,

2

as I originally stated, that Amendment 73 is a ballot

3

access regulation clearly permissible under Article I,

4

section 4 of the Constitution, and the Arkansas court held

5

that Amendment 73 was, in fact, a qualification.

6

that scenario, we request the Court -- this Court to

7

reverse the Arkansas court and remand --

8

9

QUESTION:

Under

But if it were a qualification, then

would you lose?

10

GENERAL BRYANT:

11

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.

But why, if we're thinking on

12

qualification, I take it if the States can pass

13

qualification such as the one at issue, they also could

14

pass qualifications setting requirements of birth, or

15

property, or previous service in the State legislature, or

16

add on to the list almost indefinitely, and why should we

17

think that the Constitution, particularly with Hamilton

18

and Madison, intended to give the States the power to

19

create that kind of Congress?

20

GENERAL BRYANT:

Your Honor, under your

21

scenario, Article -- the States can add additional

22

qualifications.

23

added, of course, would be subject to First and Fourteenth

24

Amendment scrutiny, so any scenario that the State came up

25

with that violated the First and Fourteenth Amendment

That is our position.

Any qualifications

1

would, in fact, not pass constitutional muster.
The Tenth Amendment gives the States the

2

3

authority to adopt additional qualifications, and as has

4

already been pointed out here, the States, all the States

5

in this Union have a number of qualifications on their

6

books.

7

Arkansas requires a candidate for Congress to be

8

a registered voter.

A registered voter cannot be a felon

9

or a mental incompetent.

Arkansas -- the Arkansas

10

constitution prohibits a Senator who is appointed from

11

running for reelection, so Arkansas has a number of laws

12

on its books, both statutory and constitutional, that

13

amount to qualifications under the Respondent's theory,

14

and if qualifications --

15

QUESTION:

But my question actually was why

16

would Hamilton or Madison, who, after all, were writing

17

before the Fourteenth Amendment was passed, think that it

18

was possible that this Constitution would permit

19

qualifications for the Congress based upon birth or

20

property, and why would we today think that a State could

21

pass a rule saying to be in Congress you have to be a

22

previous member of the State legislature, for example?

23

GENERAL BRYANT:

Your Honor, our position is

24

that Madison and Hamilton did not preclude the State from

25

adding additional qualifications under the Tenth

2

Amendment.
QUESTION:

So therefore Hamilton and Madison,

3

when they wrote the Federalists and said to the people,

4

don't worry about creating a Government of birth or

5

property, that they were wrong in that?

6

GENERAL BRYANT:

Your Honor, no, Your Honor,

7

because under the State's position any qualification that

8

went to the point you suggested would be unconstitutional

9

under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

10

QUESTION:

This was before --

11

GENERAL BRYANT:

12

QUESTION:

Yes --

I guess that Madison and Hamilton and

13

the people they were writing for weren't worried about

14

their State legislatures.

15

legislatures were responsive to the people.

They felt that their State

16

They were worried about whether this new animal

17

that was being created would be responsive to the people,

18

and they weren't about to give it vast powers to impose

19

qualifications that their own people didn't like.

20

the only explanation for the fact that in all of this

21

discussion there's no -- in the debates there's no

22

categorical mention about this issue about the States

23

adding qualifications.

24
25

They weren't worried about the States.

That's

The

States were the people as far as they were concerned.
