ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. HARTE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. HARTE:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
The issue presented in this case is a

11
12

straightforward one identified by paragraph 13 of the

13

client's agreement which was presented to the

14

Mastrobuonos -- Antonio Mastrobuono, a teacher of medieval

15

history, and his wife, an artist, and the client's

16

agreement provision provides, in relevant part, this

17

agreement shall be governed by the State of New York.

18

This is a choice-of-law clause.

19

into a comprehensive arbitration agreement.

It then moves forward

Now, the point I guess which we diverge on,

20
21

myself and Shearson's counsel, is just essentially what

22

was agreed by the Mastrobuonos.

23

suggest that they agreed to give up any substantive rights

24

knowingly is preposterous, but what they are said to have

25

agreed.

Parenthetically, to

1

They are said to have agreed to the Garrity rule

2

by the first sentence of paragraph 13.

3

a rule in New York of approximately 20 years, states

4

essentially that arbitrators are not empowered to grant

5

punitive damages, and therefore, essentially, resort must

6

have to be taken to the judicial forum.

7

The Garrity rule,

You move to the next aspect of the agreement,

8

the comprehensive agreement which relates to arbitration,

9

and it is straightforward.

They agree to arbitrate any

10

controversy arising out of or relating to my accounts, the

11

transactions with you, your officers, directors, agents,

12

or employees, the grants that say they shall be settled by

13

arbitration in accordance with the rules in effect of the

14

National Association of Securities Dealers.

15

Now, the point that we have sought to stress in

16

our papers is that either the FAA is going to be employed

17

or it isn't, so if the assertion is that the only judicial

18

forum -- the only forum in New York available for punitive

19

damages to the Mastrobuonos is a judicial forum, because

20

of the comprehensive nature of the arbitration, and the

21

statements of this Court time and again that if punitive

22

damages are to be obtained only in the judicial forum,

23

then there is a preemption because Federal law applies --

resolution of this case depend upon what it is the parties

something, the arbitrator thought that punitives should be

MR. HARTE:

Well, there was a reference made in

12

the arbitrator's award that reliance was placed upon some

13

papers filed by the Mastrobuonos.

supplemental brief that, indeed, within those papers was a

15

statement that, look, there is preemption, and I frankly

don't know and can't help you, because all I have is what

the arbitrator said, but it would seem to me that they had

QUESTION:

Did they or did they not contemplate

the award of punitive damages as a possibility?
MR. HARTE:

It would be my view that necessarily

they would have had to do that, and did, because the

issues were all presented to them.

6

that determination, necessarily you would have to assume

that they had interpreted what the parties had agreed to

and what they had not agreed to.

sentence.

The next sentence in the comprehensive

arbitration agreement is that the parties are going to

to punitive damages in a judicial forum.

2

MR. HARTE:

3

QUESTION:

Yes.
Is it correct, Mr. Harte, that the

NASD rules do not require punitives to be awarded, nor do

5

they preclude it?

6

the question, is that correct?

7

MR. HARTE:

8

QUESTION:

The NASD rules are simply agnostic on

That's correct.

However --

So what we have is a juxtaposition of

9

NASD rules which do not answer the question, they leave

10

the question open, and a New York common law rule which

11

does answer the question to the effect that an arbitrator

12

may not, in fact, award punitive damages.

3

conflict there that needs to be resolved?

4

MR. HARTE:

Is there any

I would respectfully submit, Justice

5

Souter, that if the NASD rules are interpreted themselves,

6

they're interpreted by the manual, and the manual

7

addresses the arbitrators that they are permitted to grant

8

punitive damages.

QUESTION:

But not required.

In other words,

it's left open.
MR. HARTE:

Well, I assume that they are

22

required if they're going to arbitrate any controversy,

23

and one of the controversies was punitive damages.

So you're saying on the point in

question the NASD rules really are not agnostic.

They say

you can award them, New York law says you can't.

conflict, that's your position.
MR. HARTE:

5

Well, my position is that --no.

6

position is that when you put in a comprehensive

7

arbitration agreement to arbitrate any controversy, then

8

the NASD rules are required to move forward with that

9

issue, and the arbitrators must address it because

My

obviously it is a controversy then that would be left not

QUESTION:

12

question.

on the question of whether an arbitrator has exceeded his

15

authority as an arbitrator.

Under the FAA, there may be a judicial appeal

MR. HARTE:

QUESTION:

Yes.
Isn't the question here, whether an

arbitrator may or may not award punitive damages, an issue

displaces the Garrity rule?

Do you take the position that in that case the FAA

QUESTION:

7

Yes.

That would be --

All right, so your position, then, is

that the FAA preempts the Garrity rule.
MR. HARTE:

Yes.

It is stated in our papers,

8

assuming there is no choice of law agreement, assuming the

9

most significant context rule is applied in conflict,

10

assuming that the choice of law is necessarily under the

11

New York law -- New York law, and the Garrity rule applies

12

to New York law -- it is clear that when, in our view,

13

anyway, where you agree to a comprehensive resolution to

14

resolve any controversy, that the Federal law would

15

preempt the New York law.

16

QUESTION:

And so I take it it's your further

17

position, or am I correct about this, that when the

18

parties incorporate New York law in an agreement where

19

they expressly refer to New York law --

MR. HARTE:

MR. HARTE:

QUESTION:

7

How do you --- and we state that -- excuse me.
How do you reconcile your position

with our decision in the Volt case several years ago?
MR. HARTE:

Well, the -- if I can just continue

a response -- well, I will respond to Volt.
It is, I guess, to some surprise that we look at

8

Volt differently from the other side.

9

everybody would simply accept Volt as written, you know,

10

what was said, but our position is that Volt is entirely

11

consistent to your decision in Volt, because what you said

12

there is, look, we're going to take a look at what's

13

happening here, and if the California statute is such that

14

it says we're going to wait with respect to arbitration,

15

there are other litigants involved, the issue may be

16

resolved, there is no magic in the procedure, it does not

17

appear to us to be inconsistent with what the FAA is

18

seeking to do.

19

It would seem that

There is no removal of our right under

20

arbitration, and you state, quote, if I may, the FAA

21

"preempts State laws which require a judicial forum for

22

the resolution of claims which the contracting parties

23

agree to resolve by arbitration."

24
25

So what I say is that also in Volt you said
sections 3 and 4 have never been applied to State fori,

1

only to district court, but we're dealing with section 2,

2

and we're dealing with entirely different issue here.
This issue is that the Garrity rule forecloses

3
4

punitive damages in an arbitrable forum, and that is why I

5

return again and again to what was agreed.

6

agreed a choice of law forum which, if you accept their

7

view, stated to the Mastrobuonos you must go to a judicial

8

forum in order to obtain punitive damages under the choice

9

of law.

10

There was

But then you go to the arbitration agreement,

11

the next sentence, and it fits entirely into what you've

12

said in Volt, quoting from Perry v. Thomas, that State law

3

must give way if the only way a person can get a remedy is

4

to go to a judicial forum, and they have been -- they have

5

entered into this arbitration agreement.

6

And for example, in Perry v. Thomas, the

7

California -- State of California said in order to get a

8

wage situation resolved they had to go to a judicial

9

forum, and what you said is that the State law must give

20

way if -- if the State law says judicial forum alone, and

21

it leads from the decision.

22

You see it in McMahon, the concern about

23

arbitration, the jealousy of the courts, and it is very

24

paradoxical and ironic that this sophisticated group --

the SIC, the industry and what -- would fight for

sophisticated people, would state that judges and juries

3

were not to be trusted, and then weep and whine and hand­

ring about the decision made in the forum that they wanted

by this mumbo-jumbo now-you-see-it, now-you-don't -QUESTION:

6

Mr. Harte, may I -- maybe I

7

misunderstood your interpretation of this contract clause,

8

but I thought you were presenting the simple case that

9

when we have a choice of law clause, New York law -- New

10

York law permits punitive damages.

11

MR. HARTE:

12

QUESTION:

Yes.
And then we move on to the choice of

13

forum clause, which is we're choosing arbitration under

14

the NSAD rules, which are neutral, so you choose New York

15

substantive law which permits punitive damages, you've

16

chosen arbitration, the arbitration forum, which is

17

governed by in this case NASD rules, not California rules,

18

as in the other case, and that's -- it's as simple as

19

that, is your contract interpretation, I thought, but what

20

I'm hearing is a little more complicated.
MR. HARTE:

21

Well, if you move into a

22

requirement, and I simply state that the choice of law of

23

New York adopts the law, that's not preempted by Federal

24

law.

Federal law applies to that second sentence.

spent a lot of time stressing the similarities between

4

labor arbitration and Federal Arbitration Act arbitration,

5

but I think there's one respect in which the two are

6

different that's fairly central to this case.

7

That is, in labor arbitration, the arbitrator's

8

power is typically restricted to the interpretation and

9

the enforcement of the collective bargaining agreement

10

itself, and if a dispute arises between an individual

11

employee and the employer based upon some other source of

12

law -- for instance, a title VII claim -- typically that

13

would not be resolved by the arbitrator, it would be

14

resolved in a judicial forum just as though there were no

15

collective bargaining agreement.

16

Under -- in commercial arbitration under the

17

FAA, the thing is really fundamentally different.

18

is, you do have a contract here.

19

that the Mastrobuonos could have filed an action for

20

breach of contract contending that Shearson Lehman had

21

breached its contractual duties, but the arbitrator's

22

authority is not limited to suits arising under the

23

agreement itself.

1

of different other provisions of law that happened to

2

involve the same transactions, and the arbitration

3

agreement here stated that it would apply to all disputes

4

arising out of or involving the petitioner's accounts, and

5

consequently it was always within the natural

6

contemplation of the parties that the arbitrator might

7

ultimately be called upon to apply a variety of different

8

bodies of law.

9

And therefore when the contract said that the

10

contract, the agreement would be governed by the laws of

11

the State of New York, it certainly implied that a breach

12

of contract action would be governed by that law, but it

13

certainly didn't imply that every aspect of every dispute

14

between the parties would be so governed.

15

And, in fact, here the petitioner has filed

16

claims based on Federal securities laws, based on Illinois

17

and Texas law.

9

MR. STEWART:

It's typically the case, Your

10

Honor, that arbitrators will not give the reasons for

11

their awards.
This Court recognized that in the steelworkers'

12

13

trilogy, particularly in Enterprise Wheel, and the fact

14

that the arbitrator doesn't make clear what the basis for

15

his opinion is doesn't mean that we don't defer, so long

16

as there is -- in a sense it's like review of an act of

17

Congress, and the question is whether we can hypothesize a

18

valid basis for the award, rather than whether there is a

statement.

But in those cases, Mr. Stewart,

21

there was a great deal of talk about the law of the shop

1

the factors that this Court has relied on in the labor

2

cases in stressing the difference owed to the arbitrator

3

are unique to labor.
However, this Court also recognized in Wilko v.

4
5

Swan that the arbitrator's decision under the FAA is not

6

subject to review for legal error.
The Court has continued to recognize in McMahon,

7
8

for instance, that the bases for overturning the

9

arbitrator's decision remain limited, and the courts of

10

appeals have uniformly been of the view that an arbitrator

11

cannot be said to exceed his powers simply because the

12

reviewing court believes that the arbitrator got wrong the

question of contract interpretation.

What he said was that he was awarding punitive

damages based on the authority as cited in the

made a number of arguments, some of which are quite

similar to the ones that we're making today, namely that

12

if punitive damages are awardable in a judicial forum they

should ordinarily be awarded in arbitration as well.

that's going to be argued that seems to sort of raise this

question?

6

MR. STEWART:

Well, I guess there are about

three different answers I should give.
First, the reviewing court will typically be

7

unsure, because typically arbitrators give no explanation

8

at all, so that really can't be --

9
10

QUESTION:

But this one did give an explanation.

MR. STEWART:

And the explanation was, I'm doing

11

it for the reasons stated in the petitioner's brief, and I

12

think probably the best indication -- it's about a four-

13

page brief.

14

It contains a number of arguments.

One of them was, you can look to the spirit

15

rather than the letter of the agreement, but even that was

16

taken as a direct quotation from a New York court of

17

appeals case which said, arbitrators can look to the

18

spirit rather than the letter of the parties' agreement,

19

so even that isolated sentence was not an appeal to ignore

20

the law, it was simply a statement of what the law was.

21

As to the First Options case, one of the

22

questions presented is, if a district court denies a

23

motion to vacate an award, what should the standard of

24

review be on appeal, and the flip side is the question

25

presented here, namely, when a district court grants a

motion to vacate an award, what is the standard of review?
The conflict in the First Options case is

2

3

between the Third Circuit, which says de novo review of

4

denial of a motion to vacate, the Eleventh Circuit which

5

says an abuse of discretion review.

6

Circuit in Robbins v. Day, which is discussed in the

7

petition in First Options, said that when you have granted

8

a motion to vacate, that should be reviewed but de novo,

9

so I think under the standard of any circuit, the Seventh

But even the Eleventh

Circuit was correct in reviewing de novo the determination

of the district court that the arbitrable award should be

1

As I say, there were a number of arguments made

2

in that brief, many of which are similar to the ones that

3

we're making today, so it was not at all a brief which in

4

its essence asked the arbitrator to avoid applying the

5

contract, it was essentially a brief about how the

6

contract should be interpreted.

7

I want to return to a question Justice Souter

8

asked as to whether this is a case about the arbitrator's

9

authority, and I think that there are two kinds of issues

10
11

that may arise about authority.
One is arbitrability jurisdiction, whether a

12

particular claim or grievance or cause of action was

13

properly presented to the arbitrator rather than to the

14

court, and certainly there are a number of this Court's

15

decisions saying that the determination on that issue is

16

for the court, albeit with a presumption of arbitrability.

17

This is not a case about arbitrability.

This is

18

a case in which it is clear that the determination as to

19

whether punitive damages should be awarded is to be made

20

by the arbitrator.

21

The only question is, what standard of law

22

should the arbitrator apply, and the Court has held in

23

Enterprise Wheel, in Misco, in W. H. Grace, that when a

24

claim is clearly properly before the arbitrator, the

25

arbitrator's determination as to what remedies are

discretion, and that's particularly true here when the

3

propriety of the remedy turns on interpretation of the

contract.

That is, the respondents don't contend that the

They don't contend

that there is some other provision of law which bars an

If you read the contract the way you were

suggesting, there is an ambiguity, but that ambiguity

would normally be resolvable against you as the party who

Virtually every case that has reviewed this question, the

question of the applicability of the New York choice of

one and the same, for this purpose.
QUESTION:

6

Mr. Polizzotto, do you think that the

7

New York law at issue here has any existence except as

8

something to be referred to by private parties?

9

to say, if it were not adopted voluntarily by the parties,

That is

10

would this New York rule be enforceable under our current

11

interpretation of the FAA?
MR. POLIZZOTTO:

12

I think the answer to that

13

question is probably yes, and let me explain why.

The

14

Court has made quite clear that the FAA does not preempt

15

the whole law of arbitration, and in fact there needs to

16

be a clear and unmistakable congressional intent to

17

preempt.

18

about punitive damages, so in the absence of an agreement

19

between the parties on this question, I think it is

20

entirely possible that a State rule such as this would

21

have applicability when New York law applies of its own

22

force.

There's nothing in the FAA that says anything

23

QUESTION:

So in --

24

MR. POLIZZOTTO:

Government on that point.

So we disagree with the

QUESTION:

1

So instead of declining to honor

2

arbitral awards, which would violate the FAA as we've

3

interpreted it, the States could instead render arbitral

4

awards worthless by piece-by-piece saying you can't give

5

punitive damages, maybe you can't give expectation

6

damages, maybe you can give nothing but a declaratory

7

judgment.

8

that violate the FAA?

9

Could they do that, and that would -- wouldn't

MR. POLIZZOTTO:

Well, the FAA has preemptive

10

force in the context in which people are attempting to

11

derive or get access to the arbitral forum as an initial

12

matter.

13

QUESTION:

Well, then, don't you think it means

14

that the States cannot render the arbitral forum nugatory

15

by simply saying, yes, we have a general law, but this law

16

won't be applicable in an arbitral forum?

17

me to violate the --

It may mean that, Justice

19

21

QUESTION:

That seems to

This case is a far

It may be this case, because if this

22

provision of New York law is totally preempted and is only

23

there so it's a handy referral for a private agreement,

24

which we've said can supersede the FAA, then maybe it's

25

not New York law any more.

I mean, if it has no binding

effect in and of itself, maybe it's not New York law.
I mean, I don't consider it law if it's just

3

something that can be referred to by the parties if they

4

want to adopt it, but that could not be imposed upon the

5

parties absent their agreement.

6

imposed on the parties absent their agreement.

7

MR. P0LIZZ0TT0:

You think this could be

I think there's an argument to

8

suggest that the FAA does not have the type of preemptive

9

force that would override the natural power of New York

10

law, in an appropriate case.

11

QUESTION:

But isn't this always --

12

QUESTION:

It seems to me that your case may

13

very well turn on that, because it strikes me as rather

14

odd that if the parties simply agree to arbitrate without

15

a choice of law clause or a mention of New York, and it

16

happens to be that the transaction is in New York, the

17

parties are in New York, they apply New York law, that

18

they would apply the Federal preemptive portion of New

19

York law and ignore the Garrity rule.

20

It seems to me rather strange that when the

21

parties go one further step and say, we want New York law,

22

that suddenly you interpret the contract as saying we want

23

New York law absent prevailing Federal preemption law.

24

That seems to me very odd.

2

And it seems to me that's what you

have to say in order to win your case.
MR. POLIZZOTTO:

3

Well, I think that's right to

4

some extent, but that's because the animating policy and

5

the animating preemptive force of the FAA is, what did the

6

parties agree to in this case?

7

Justice O'Connor was correct in the very first question

that she asked the petitioner, that fundamentally here

provide?

Mastrobuonos, as I understand it, brought this case in

14

Federal district court, and you removed it, is that

15

correct?

16

MR. POLIZZOTTO:

17

QUESTION:

Correct.

So if they had brought this case in

18

New York Federal District Court, or they brought it in

19

Illinois Federal District Court and said, see this choice

20

of law clause, shall be governed by the laws of New York,

21

and so we want compensatory and punitive damages, suppose

22

you had not asked to have the case dismissed because of

23

the arbitration clause.

24

That was something that no law required, no Illinois law,

25

no New York law, no Federal law.

You were not required to do that.

It was yours to dispose

So if they had just gone into Federal court, and

you hadn't asked to have the arbitral forum, they would

have gotten compensatory and punitive damages, right,

But that is precisely the distinction that is so

12

powerful with respect to the Federal Arbitration Act.

13

see it is, what did they agree to?

2

MR. POLIZZOTTO:

3

QUESTION:

Correct.

In my agreement, it says they agree

4

to be governed by the laws of New York, and then they also

5

agree that any controversy will be settled by the NASD

6

rules.
The NASD rules specifically say in their

7
8

arbitrator's manual that punitive damages may be a remedy,

9

so it seems -- why isn't there at least an ambiguity as to

10

what they meant, and once you find an ambiguity, then why

11

aren't we simply required to follow what the arbitrator

12

interpreted them to mean?

13

MR. POLIZZOTTO:

The rules are -- the manual are

14

not the rules, first of all.

15

QUESTION:

The manual is the manual.

But beside -- that's -- all I'm

16

saying is, isn't it at least ambiguous as to what they

17

meant, and once you find it even a little bit ambiguous,

18

then doesn't the court -- don't the courts have to follow

19

the arbitrator's interpretation of the contract as to what

20

they meant?

about it.

23

In other words, isn't this case way north of

specifically gives to the courts -- it's a directive to

2

the courts that says, you are obligated to vacate awards

3

to the extent that the arbitrators have exceeded their

4

authority.
QUESTION:

5

Well, I mean, Misco says, yes, that's

6

right, but don't ever do it, and that's in the labor area,

7

so maybe we always used to follow it that way in the court

8

of appeals, anyway, and now this isn't the labor area, so

perhaps because it's not the labor area, it isn't true

don't every do it, maybe sometimes do it, but at least

11

there -- there I'm exaggerating, but you see my point.
MR. P0LIZZ0TT0:

distinction, and a valid one, between the question of

-- why we don't have to follow the

MR. POLIZZOTTO:

One clear answer to that is the

7

fact that this is not what the arbitrators were asked to

8

do in this case.

9

QUESTION:

Normally we pay no attention to that,

10

except in extreme circumstances, in a court of appeals.

11

That is, normally an arbitration award has no reasons, so

12

normally you don't really cross-examine the arbitrator.

QUESTION:

MR. POLIZZOTTO:

Part of the record --

Why is this different?
Part of the record in the

law, disregard the authority and the constraints on that

Yes, but the next sentence

contradicted that, and the parties say all kinds of things

in their brief.

MR. POLIZZOTTO:

1

Except in this case the

2

application, I believe, and I think Garrity's -- a fair

3

reading of Garrity indicates this.

4

it relates exclusively to arbitration, is a substantive

5

pronouncement of law in the State of New York, and the

6

petitioners concede this in their main brief.

that flat out in their brief.

The Garrity rule, as

I would also say in partial further response to

9

your question, Justice Breyer, there's a happy synergy, if

10

you will, between the statutory language under section 10,

11

which speaks about arbitrators exceeding their powers, and

12

the Garrity case itself.

13

Garrity, Chief Judge Bertel uses precisely the

14

of the case.
