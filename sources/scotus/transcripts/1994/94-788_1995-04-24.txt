ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. STRAUSS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. STRAUSS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The question in this case is whether a district

12

court in an admiralty collision case may in the exercise

13

of its discretion withhold prejudgment interests on the

14

ground that the plaintiff was the party predominantly at

15

fault, and that the defendant, throughout much of the

16

litigation, had reason to believe it would not be held

17

liable at all.

18

The collision involved in this case occurred on

19

Christmas Eve, 1979, when a storm blew up in Lake Michigan

20

near Milwaukee.

berth, took on water, and sunk.

The city denied negligence and said that the

accident had been caused by the negligence of the ship's

master in leaving the ship essentially unattended in its

berth, without any means to monitor the weather or to call

for help.

The city also counterclaimed for a quarter of a

The suit didn't come to trial until 1986, at

7
8

which point the issue of liability was tried.

The

9

district court decided the liability issue in 1989, and it

10

ruled at that point that the respondents were almost

11

entirely at fault.

12

only 4 percent of the damages.

13

Specifically, the city was liable for

year later.

court had inadequately explained its apportionment of

17

liability.

18

Circuit itself reapportioned the liability, still

assigning the bulk of the share to respondents, two-thirds

20

to respondents, one-third to the city.

21

The Seventh Circuit held that the district

Instead of remanding, however, the Seventh

At that point, the parties entered into a

22

settlement agreement on the liability issue.

agreed to pay $1.67 million, compared to the $6.5 million

agreed in this settlement that the district court would

1

determine whether prejudgment interest was to be awarded,

2

and if so, in what amount.

3

The district court then denied the respondents'

4

request for $5.3 million in prejudgment interest.

The

5

district court recognized, and it is common ground here,

6

that in admiralty the presumption is in favor of awarding

7

prejudgment interest, but the district court denied

8

prejudgment interest in this case on the ground that the

9

plaintiff was far more at fault than the city, and that

10

throughout most of the litigation, nearly all of the

11

litigation, there was a good chance that the city would

12

not be held liable in any way.

13

The Seventh Circuit again reversed, holding that

14

the district court may never exercise discretion to

15

withhold prejudgment interest on the grounds that the

16

plaintiff was at fault, and this Court then granted

17

certiorari.

18

Now, there is no general Federal prejudgment

19

interest statute.

Instead, judge-made rules govern

20

prejudgment interest in Federal courts in admiralty, and

21

in cases arising under Federal statutes that are silent on

22

the matter of prejudgment interest.

23

The one constant in these --

statute governing prejudgment interest, period, or

prejudgment interest in admiralty cases?
MR. STRAUSS:

z

There is no Federal statute

3

governing prejudgment interest in admiralty cases.

4

There's also no umbrella Federal statute, as there is for

5

postjudgment interest.

6

provisions in certain specific Federal programmatic

7

statutes.
In the judge-made cases that govern admiralty

8

9

There are prejudgment interest

and also the Federal statutes that are silent on

10

prejudgment interests, the one constant has been that an

11

award of prejudgment interest is by no means automatic, as

12

this Court said in its most recent such case.

13

trial court has discretion in deciding whether to award

14

prejudgment interest.

Rather, the

15

Here, the district court exercised its

16

discretion, and withheld prejudgment interest because two

17

factors coalesced.

18

13-year litigation, the city had every reason to think

19

that it would be subject to no significant liability.

First, for the first 11 years of the

The suit was initially brought by a ship that

20
21

had broken loose from its mooring.

The city did not moor

22

the ship.

23

When the district court decided the liability issue, the

24

district court reapportioned the liability on a 96 to 4

25

basis, holding the city only 4 percent at fault.

The claim was only negligent failure to warn.

Even after the court of appeals reversed,

1

the

2

plaintiffs were still the party predominantly at fault by

a ratio of 2 to 1,

influenced the district court's exercise of its

5

discretion.
QUESTION:

That was 11 years after the

Justice Scalia.

the district court, which

You leap to the conclusion from the

20

fact that the district court gave a 96-4 break that all

21

during the period up until then the city thought it would

22

have negligible liability.

23

I don't know why that follows.

Certainly it's reasonable to say that from the

24

time of the district court decision until the time of the

25

court of appeals decision the city thought, what the heck,

I'm not -- the interest won't amount to anything.

2

only for that 1 year.

That's not such a big deal.

MR. STRAUSS:

3

It's

Well, Justice Scalia, I think

4

that's quintessentially the kind of issue that the

5

district court is in a position to resolve, and were the

6

district court to say, in the exercise of its discretion,

7

you should have known all along that you might be held

8

substantially liable, the district court could exercise
its discretion and award prejudgment interest in some

10
11

amount.
But the district court here reached the opposite

12

conclusion, and all we're contending for is that the

13

district court should be able to exercise its discretion

14

in that regard.

15

QUESTION:

Then what --

16

QUESTION:

How did this award get -- excuse me.

17

How did this award get to be $5 million of

18

interest on a $1 million award?

1

MR. STRAUSS:

The accident occurred on Christmas

20

Eve, 1 7 , Justice Kennedy, and the interest was

21

accumulating all that time.

QUESTION:

What was the base sum on which the

interest was accumulating?
MR. STRAUSS:
is for $5.3 million.

1.677 million.

That's the claim,

respondents are making.
As I said, the other factor that influenced the

2

3

district court and that has been prominent in the -QUESTION:

4

I'm still somewhat astounded that it

5

can be almost two-and-a-half times the amount of the

6

principal.

7

MR. STRAUSS:

And needless to say, Justice

8

Kennedy, we'd be delighted if it were a lower amount, but

9

that's the amount the respondents are asking for, I assume

10

calculating it at prime rate, which is of course a serious

11

question whether that should be the rate, when it's a

12

municipal government that's being asked for the interest,

13

but respondents make that calculation.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. STRAUSS:

16

denied all prejudgment interest.

reversed that and remanded for a calculation of the -- of

interest.

QUESTION:

Did you challenge that as well?
Well, we, in -- the district court
The Seventh Circuit

So in the district court you were

20

just arguing straight up interest or no interest, not any

21

question if interest, then the rate.

22

MR. STRAUSS:

We also argued about the rate in

23

the district court, Justice Ginsburg, and it's our

24

position that prime rate is completely inappropriate for a

25

municipal government that can, after all, borrow in the

market at less than half of prime rate, and that would

continue to be our position.

QUESTION:

That issue would still be open to you

if you --

MR. STRAUSS:

QUESTION:

That --

If the Seventh Circuit were to be

affirmed -MR. STRAUSS:

If the Seventh Circuit were to be

affirmed, the issue of rate would still be open, that's

10

right, Justice Ginsburg, although the Seventh Circuit did

11

seem to say that prime rate -- the choice should be

12

between prime rate and the short term borrowing rate of

13

the city, so it made some remarks about the rate, but the

14

issue of rate would, subject to those limits placed on it

15

by the Seventh Circuit, be open on remand, that's right.

16

QUESTION:

I guess I don't know why the amount

17

should depend on what the city could borrow for as opposed

18

to what the person to whom the city should have paid the

19

money sooner would have been able to get for the money.

20

MR. STRAUSS:

Well, there again, Justice Scalia,

21

that points to a problem that I think the district court

22

is in a position to resolve, although I should say that

23

our contention is the district -- what we're asking this

24

Court to do is simply to announce the principle that in a

25

case where the plaintiff is predominantly at fault and the

1

defendant had a reason to think it wasn't liable, the

2

district court can exercise its discretion.

3

The other factor, as I said, that influenced the

4

district court was just, as this Court has said in its

5

prejudgment cases, the relative equities of the parties, a

6

factor that this Court has frequently said should play a

7

role in deciding the award of prejudgment interest, and

8

the district court was influenced by the fact that the

9

plaintiffs were not only at fault but predominantly at

10

fault.

11

After all, in a regime of contributory

12

negligence, which to be sure admiralty has never had, in a

13

regime of contributory negligence, a party who is even

14

somewhat at fault receives nothing.

QUESTION:

How does it work out in the Jones

Act?

20

I -- under the Jones Act, I

21

believe, Justice Ginsburg, prejudgment interest is not

22

available,

provisions are aligned with those of the FELA, and this

interest available under the FELA, so that while I can't

Here's why.

say that it's a settled issue, I believe prejudgment

2

interest is simply unavailable under the Jones Act.
QUESTION:

3

Is there any other comparative

4

negligence analogy in the realm of admiralty where this

5

question comes up, other than collision?
MR. STRAUSS:

6

In personal injury cases as well,

other than Jones Act cases, such as a personal injury

arising out of a collision, the issue would come up.

16

we don't contest, but the district court has discretion,

17

and the position that we contend for and that many courts

18

of appeals have endorsed is that when there's a dispute

19

about the existence of any liability, and the plaintiff is

20

at fault, the district court may -- need not, but may

21

exercise its discretion to deny prejudgment interest.

Is that -- I

for you on rebuttal.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Strauss, I guess I'm just missing

the basic logic of the position.
If we reject the contributory negligence concept

13

in which the -- you know, the tortfeasor is not going to

14

get a nickel, so that we do not have a per se rule that

15

those who commit torts or are in some way responsible for

16

their own damages get nothing, and in fact we do, as here,

17

have a rule in which the only thing you are paying for is

18

the share with respect to which you are at fault, why

19

should you be treated any differently from any other

20

tortfeasor who is at fault, whether in fact there was

21

negligence on the part of the other party or not?

22

shouldn't you pay for the time value of the damage that

23

you caused?

24
25

MR. STRAUSS:

Why

Well, Justice Souter, we're not

asking to be treated any differently from any tortfeasor.

The common law rule was that you don't recover prejudgment

think meant liquidated.

Yes.

At admiralty it was, you just had the

MR. STRAUSS:

At admiralty you had the

which was not hostile to it, but --

Not to be awarded without a good

reason, and I'm saying what are the good reasons, and your

first answer is, well, it's been treated differently,

which is I think the equivalent of saying we just haven't.
MR. STRAUSS:

6

Well, there really -- okay,

7

Justice Souter there are two questions, and I think I may

8

have been confused over which you were asking.

question is, why should there be any discretion at all,

that to say there's no discretion would be to overrule

QUESTION:

5

MR. STRAUSS:

Okay.
If the question is, given that

6

there's discretion, why should it be exercised in a case

7

like this, then there really are two points to be made.

8

The first is that awarding prejudgment interest puts

9

pressure on a defendant to settle.

There may be cases in

20

which, the district court apparently thought this was one,

21

that it would be unfair to put so much pressure on a

22

defendant to settle.

awarded, defendant, the city in this case, is in the

equity-like considerations, the relative equities of the

2

parties, considerations of fundamental fairness, which I

3

think is best interpreted as reflecting the kinds of

4

concerns that underlay both contributory negligence and

5

different kinds of comparative fault rules.

6

There are, after all, comparative fault regimes

7

in which a plaintiff that is 50-percent at fault doesn't

8

recover at all, and the best interpretation, I think, of

9

the Court's repeated references to fundamental fairness,

10

considerations of the equities, is to say that a district

11

court can say, well in this case the plaintiff was so much

12

more at fault that we're going to deny not its recovery,

13

it gets its recovery, but we're going to deny it

prejudgment interest.

QUESTION:

Because it -- interest -- tc the

economic inequity, prejudgment interest can distort that

even further, but you don't think that's the reason for

the solicitude over the years?

23

MR. STRAUSS:

No, not at all, Justice Souter.

of which is the body of cases Justice Ginsburg alluded to.

MR. STRAUSS:

No, I think this principle that --

MR. STRAUSS:

1

The tradition, Justice Scalia --

2

the tradition is a tradition of discretion in the awarding

3

of prejudgment interest, of not regarding prejudgment

4

interest simply as an element of the plaintiff's

5

compensation.
QUESTION:

6

Yes, but I -- but what's important to

7

me is why should the discretion be exercised in this case?

8

You assert that the prejudgment interest is sort of a

9

penalty upon the losing party for not settling sooner.

10

don't know why one has to look at it that way.

11

look at it as simply natural justice.

I

One can

The person who's been injured has been deprived

12

13

of the value of what was taken from the time it was taken,

14

not from the time the judgment occurred.

15

an equally valid way to look at it, and if you look at it

16

that way, I see no reason to reduce the amount simply

17

because the.city had no reason to think it was going to

18

lose.

19

Why isn't that

The fact is, the city was at fault to a certain

20

amount, and it should pay up and do justice.

21

with that?

22

MR. STRAUSS:

What's wrong

If the -- Justice Scalia, if the

23

sole objective were to provide the plaintiff with full

24

compensation, it would be very difficult to explain why

25

prejudgment interest at some rate shouldn't be awarded.

The rate would be highly controversial.
But prejudgment interest, like attorney's fees,

3

is one of the elements of our system, or like indirect

4

economic costs, or like approximate causation, these are

5

elements of our system in which compensation of the

6

plaintiffs has not been the sole objectives.

7

Plaintiffs aren't fully compensated when they

8

have to pay their own fees.

Nonetheless, in our system

9

they have to pay their own fees.

They're not fully

10

compensated when they don't get prejudgment interest, but

11

the tradition in our system for over 100 years, which

12

Congress not only hasn't changed, but when Congress

13

thought about enacting a general Federal law, it left

discretion alone --

QUESTION:

The only substantial series of cases

that you show where this discretion was exercised are

cases where it was exercised in order to again move in the

fact that the city couldn't settle.

20

majority of cases where it was exercised, it was exercised

to mitigate the old rule that no matter how minimally

negligent you were, you ended up paying 50 percent.

Certainly, the

to mitigate unfairness.

MR. STRAUSS:

In fact, one of --

What else was it used for?
Well, one of the cases we cite

4

from this Court, The Scotland, Justice Bradley's opinion

5

from 1884 or '5, upheld a denial of prejudgment interest,

6

and Justice Bradley, explaining why he was upholding the

7

denial, talked about how reasonable it was for the

8

defendant in this case to pursue the position it was

9

pursuing in the case.

He didn't --

10

QUESTION:

Was that a case of 50 percent?

It was not, Justice Ginsburg.

think it was a case of undivided damages.

19

MR. STRAUSS:

There are no findings on this

point, Justice O'Connor, but so far as one can infer from

21

the record, there were really, well, three things going

22

on.

disqualified for a conflict of interest, and there was a

2

trip to the court of appeals about that.

3

The second was the case was transferred from the

4

docket of one district judge to another, and the third was

5

that the district judge took 3 years from the date of the

6

submission of the case to the date of rendering the

7

judgment, so those three factors, combined with the usual

8

delays of discovery, so far as I can tell from the record.

As I say, there are no findings on the question of --

been used to offset the harsh effects of the divided

2

damages rule.

3

We lay out many reasons in our brief, including

4

the one I mentioned to Justice Souter, the cases that were

5

cited, that we cited in our brief that the divided damages

6

rule wasn't in play and nonetheless this mutual fault

7

approach to’prejudgment interest was applied, but I

8

suppose the best way to explain the weakness of the court

9

of appeals reasoning is that this -- denying prejudgment

10

interest is a very crude way of dealing with the supposed

11

inequities of the divided damages rule.

12

When lower courts wanted to deal with those --

13

with the perceived harshness of that rule, what they did

14

was to design rules to deal with it, the so-called major-

15

minor fault rule, that when a party was only somewhat at

16

fault they would not divide damages, and the so-called in

17

extremis rule, which operated to somewhat the same effect.

18

QUESTION:

What amount of discretion did the

19

Seventh Circuit's opinion in this case leave to district

20

courts in the future to deny prejudgment interest?

21

MR. STRAUSS:

None on the grounds of the

22

plaintiff being predominantly at fault, or the defendant

23

having a reasonable litigation position throughout the

24

litigation.

None on that ground.

that prejudgment interest could be denied if the plaintiff

2

delayed in litigating, although, of course, Justice

3

Scalia's line of questions could be asked about that, too,

even if the plaintiff's delaying, the defendant still has

10

Mr. Stover.

11

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARNEY B. STOVER, JR.

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

13
14

MR. STOVER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

15

I'd like to go directly to a couple of questions

16

asked here, because I've lived with this case since that

17

ship went down and I saw it the next morning, and I know

18

some of the answers and I don't think Mr. Strauss does.

19

First of all, in personal injury cases as well

20

as in all admiralty cases, prejudgment interest is the

21

rule.

22

is cited in our brief, out of the Sixth Circuit, which

23

disagrees with the Fifth Circuit, holds that prejudgment

24

interest in.a personal injury case is the rule.

25

As a matter of fact, Anderson v. Whittaker, which

All admiralty courts in all circuits, including

1

the Fifth and the Eleventh, hold that prejudgment interest

2

is to be awarded.

3

in terms of a court has the discretion to award it, or it

4

is the rule and the court has discretion to deny an award

5

of prejudgment interest, the measure is still the same.

6

Did the court abuse its discretion by denying prejudgment

7

interest?

8

9

Now, whether you want to talk about it

The reason we're here is because the Ninth,
Sixth, and Seventh Circuits hold that the exception to

10

awarding prejudgment interest is special circumstances,

11

and all courts agree on that.

12

The Ninth, Sixth, and Seventh Circuits hold that

13

mutual fault, or if you want to call it magnitude of

14

fault, or if you want to call it genuine dispute in a

15

mutual fault situation, they are not special

16

circumstances, and they do not justify by themselves a

17

denial of prejudgment interest.

18

The Third and Eighth Circuits have not ruled on

19

the question,

20

they probably are going to go along with the Sixth,

21

Seventh, and Ninth in that line of reasoning.

22

but have given indication in cases that

District courts in the First, Second, Third,

23

Fourth, and Eighth Circuits have held that mutual fault is

24

not a special circumstance.

25

The Fifth Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit,

1

which generally goes along with it, have held that it is a

2

special circumstance, and a judge may exercise his

3

discretion to deny prejudgment interest if he wants to

4

because of mutual fault, and that's why we're here.

5

There's a split in the circuits on this, and the majority

6

rule is what I'm espousing, and the minority rule is what

7

Mr. Strauss is espousing.

8

It seems to me that this is a relatively simple

9

thing, although nothing is ever simple, I guess, in life,

10

but the underlying philosophy for the award of a

11

prejudgment interest is that it is a part of damages.

12

is compensation.

QUESTION:

2

Mr. Stover, if you're not accepting

3

that, and assuming that we've got some policy choices to

4

make, can you tell us what percentage of cases as a

5

general rule in admiralty involve mutual fault, so that if

6

we were to rule, for example, that mutual fault was a

7

reason to deny them, what percentage of cases would we be

8

excluding from the general rule if we did that?
MR. STOVER:

Well, Justice Souter, I can't --

you're talking about intersection accidents with

But in admiralty, prejudgment interest has

always been awarded.

3

beginning of this country, and in the earliest cases, and

these are cited in, I think, the briefs of both parties,

there's a case, Del Col v. Arnold, way back in 3 Dallas,

before they ever even were doing anything but summarizing

And the Anna Maria, and the Amiable Nancy, both

You can go all the way back to the

of which were decided by Chief Justice Marshall, were

prize cases, where they were dealing with privateers who

had seized vessels and seized cargo illegally, the rule

13

was to have them pay back to the owner the value of the

14

vessel or the value of the cargo plus interest to the date

of judgment, and admiralty has always awarded prejudgment

16

interest, except these exceptions.

said that it was to be awarded, but The Scotland and

it makes a difference or not as to whether it's a special

or unusual circumstance as you use the term, had the

ultimate outcome been the same as at the end of the first

Would even a 96, 97 percent fault be

MR. STOVER:

I don't think so, Your Honor, but

12

one of the basic reasons that that particular finding of

13

the trial court was overturned was because

14

96 percent/4 percent is the exact ratio of the claimed

15

damages, $6.5 million and a quarter of a million dollars,

16

and that obviously is no grounds for apportioning fault

17

under a true comparative negligence regime, and that's one

18

of the reasons why it was turned over.

19

QUESTION:

No, but conceivably there could be a

20

valid reason for that kind of an apportionment, and

21

instead of it coming out even,

22

policy -- and I think this is to this Court's way of

thinking, too.

The underlying policy or objective is not to put

the parties in the same position they would have been in

14

back at the time of casualty, but to put them in the same

15

position today that they would have been in had the

16

casualty not occurred, and the only way to do that is to

17

award interest during the intervening period.

18

In a case of mutual fault and mutual damage like

1

this, it doesn't make any difference in dollars and cents

20

whether you assess the true comparative negligence and

21

then take the damages and assess prejudgment interest on

22

the city's damages and assess prejudgment interest on the

23

ship's damages and then offset them, or whether you just

24

offset the damages and assess prejudgment interest on the

25

difference.

The dollars and cents comes out identically.

1

whether the district judge chose to give prejudgment

3

MR. STOVER:

Yes, sir.

I think it would

preclude settlements, or slow them down because of the

5

uncertainty, the lack of uniformity --

6

QUESTION:

Presumably a settlement itself would

7

make the litigation itself and the amount payable become

8

due much earlier, so that prejudgment interest would be a

9

smaller factor than if you tried to assess it after trial

10
11

and appeal.
MR. STOVER:

By the same token, Mr. Chief

12

Justice, I think that leaving open the question as to

13

prejudgment interest, leaving it up to the discretion of

14

the trial judge, would encourage a party, particularly a

15

party which had incurred lesser damages, to gamble, to

16

roll the dice.

17

What have we got to lose?

If they decide

18

against us, we just pay what we would have to pay anyway,

19

but in the meantime, we have had -- we gamble that we have

20

had this interest free, because the judge in a mutual

21

fault decision will deny prejudgment interest, whereas if

22

the rule is to award it, there is certainty.

23

And in fact I think that a rule that would award

prejudgment interest in mutual fault cases would encourage

Well, Justice Kennedy, I don't

think the Seventh Circuit is the only one that has ever

stepped in and reassessed a fault and even said what it is

instead of sending it back, and off-hand I can't cite you

the authority, but I remember going through this at the

time of the appeal, and they weren't the first who ever

13

MR. STOVER:

Well,

it seems to me that this

15

and if you are considering true comparative negligence,

16

then when you compare the negligence and reach a final

conclusion as to it,

is just bypass that and offset them to begin with, and

there was a net recovery.

But the party entitled to the net recovery is

QUESTION:

Unfortunately,

Would it be, in your view, a

permissible special circumstance if the trial -- finder of

fact thought that the prevailing party for its share of

10

the responsibility was guilty of wilful and wanton

11

misconduct that in other contexts were adjusted by

12

punitive damages?

13

MR. STOVER:

Well, Justice Stevens, I think if

14

one party is guilty of wanton and wilful misconduct in

15

your comparison of negligence you take that into account.

16

QUESTION:

But even though what they did only

contributed -- was only the causal factor for half of the

18

damages?

19

conduct might not affect the division between whether it's

normally justify punitive damages.

2

and ordinary negligence on the part of the other party not

taking that into account in apportioning the fault.

4

would think every court would do that.
I would like to say one thing.

5

I

If this Court

6

should see fit to uphold the Seventh Circuit and to uphold

7

the underlying policy and all, I believe that it would be

8

within the scope of the consideration and within the scope

9

of this case if the Court could lay down some parameters

10

for the awarding of prejudgment interest.
I don't mean talking about prime rate, or

11
12

Government bonds, or U.S. Treasury bills, or anything like

3

that, because that is within the discretion of the trial

4

court, but fixing some parameters so that it is clear that

5

prejudgment interest is to be awarded as compensation, as

6

damages.

7

The purpose of it is to place the party that's

8

getting -- that's recovering the money in the position

9

that it would have been today had the accident not

20

occurred, and the way to do that is to assess interest

21

during the intervening period at a reasonable -- let's say

22

to assess a reasonable or just interest during the

23

intervening point -- period from the point of view of the

QUESTION:

Mr. Stover, how does that differ from

3

the holding of the Seventh Circuit that mutual fault of

4

the parties in a collision case does not constitute a

5

circumstance justifying denial of prejudgment interest.

6

What more do you want this Court to say, other than that's

7

right or wrong?

8

9

MR. STOVER:

Well, personally, if the Court will

say that, and says I'm right, the Seventh Circuit is

10

right, I wouldn't want any more, but I would just think

11

that as a matter of policy, since this Court is

12

considering prejudgment interest in a mutual fault case

13

and this Court has a history of developing a philosophy to

14

award prejudgment interest unless it's precluded by

15

something in admiralty, by special or peculiar

16

circumstances, of course where there's a statutory

17

prohibition against it, where there's a longstanding legal

18

principle against it, but in other cases this Court has

19

been developing a history of awarding prejudgment

20

interest, so this might be a likely case to fix some

21

parameters, not specific or anything, but some general

22

parameters for the award.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. STRAUSS

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

MR. STRAUSS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

4

Two clarifications, and then just one point.

5

I'm told that one party to the case did settle at the very

6

beginning of the trial, but no effort was made to

7

integrate that settlement with the settlement with the

8

city.
Secondly, Justice Scalia, the passage in The

9
10

Scotland I was thinking of is at

8 U.S. 5 9, at 5 9, the

11

beginning of that page, and let me be clear about what my

12

submission is.

The Scotland is not a mutual fault case,

3

so the claim cannot be made that the prejudgment interest

4

is being used to adjust the -- to compensate for the

5

divided damages rule.
What Justice Bradley did there, it seems to me,

6
7

is to take into account the reasonableness of the

8

defendant's posture in the litigation, and say that

9

justified the exercise of discretion to deny prejudgment

20
21

interest.
QUESTION:

Well, as I read what he says, the

22

posture was’that the defendant tried to put up the money

23

into the court, and the court wouldn't have it.

The issue was limitation of

liability, and the defendants -- what Justice Bradley is

this in good faith.

QUESTION:

4

5

MR. STRAUSS:

6

QUESTION:

7

Well, I can see a possible reason

for -- and the plaintiff refused it.
MR. STRAUSS:

8

9

Right.

There is a certain coherence to

the idea that we should have a nondiscretionary regime in

10

which prejudgment interest is simply awarded as a matter

11

of course no matter what, in order to make the plaintiff

12

whole and take away any windfall from the defendant.

13

There's a certain coherence to that regime.

14

that regime would require upsetting literally a century of

15

precedent.

16

Of course,

If we are not going to have that regime, if we

17

are going to have a discretionary regime, then our

18

submission is that a case in which one party pursued the

19

litigation in a reasonable fashion, or at least so the

20

district court apparently thought, and that party was much

21

less at fault than the other, is an appropriate one in

22

which to exercise discretion.

23

We're not saying that in all such cases

24

prejudgment interest must be denied.

that remotely.

where the defendant is much less at fault than the

plaintiff, and the defendant had reason to think it would
