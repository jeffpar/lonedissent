ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. FARR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:

11

The Alabama law applied by the courts below

12

declaring all predispute arbitration agreements to be

13

unenforceable as a matter of public policy, embodies

14

precisely the sort of hostility to arbitration that

15

prompted Congress to enact a Federal arbitration act in

16

the first place.

17

Nevertheless, the Alabama courts held that the

18

Federal law did not apply to this case, saying that the

19

reach of the act is limited to transactions in which the

20

parties contemplated substantial interstate activity.

21

think this reading of Federal law is too narrow, for

22

several reasons.

23

First, the best reading of the language and

24

history of the act indicates that Congress meant to

25

exercise its Commerce power fully, except as it is

We

1

specifically provided in the definitions and the

2

exceptions contained in section 1 of the act, and second,

3

the benefits to commerce that Congress sought to obtain

4

through enforcement of arbitration agreements -- greater

5

certainty in dealings, lower litigation costs, fewer

6

litigation delays, and ultimately the lower cost of goods

7

and services -- apply to all transactions within the scope

8

of the Commerce power, not just to some of them.

9
10

QUESTION:

Mr. Farr, I suppose -- now, this act

was adopted in what year?

11

MR. FARR:

1925, Justice O'Connor.

12

QUESTION:

Right, and as of that time, I suppose

13

we didn't have as broad a view of Commerce power as we

14

have today?

15

MR. FARR:

Well, Your Honor, the best evidence I

16

think that we have of that in 1925 is first of all

17

Congress' own view as reflected briefly in the House

18

report, which indicated that the Commerce power extended

19

to all contracts relating to interstate commerce.

20

QUESTION:

Well, you would acknowledge, though,

21

that we had a narrower view of the Commerce Clause power

22

in 1925 than we have today?

23

MR. FARR:

Just O'Connor, I think it was not

24

uniformly as broad as it is today.

25

admit that.

I would certainly

1

However, if one looks, for example, at the brief

2

that was submitted on behalf of the ABA to Congress in

3

1924, actually, I believe, that refers to a very broad

4

definition of the Commerce power, indicating that it

5

reached not just matters that in fact involved the

6

crossing of State lines, but purely intrastate matters

7

that had an effect on interstate commerce.

8

9

QUESTION:

Well, of course, my view, as

expressed in the Southland case, is that Congress didn't

10

intend to do more in this Federal Arbitration Act than

11

affect what happens in Federal courts.

12

rejected that view.

13

This Court has

I still think that was correct, but faced with

14

Southland, do you think that we should properly give some

15

meaning to the words that Congress used involving

16

Commerce, evidencing, the word evidencing -- do the use of

17

those words indicate some narrower reach of the statute

18

than you would have us adopt?

19

There are many laws out there among the States

20

that try to protect consumer contracts from having

21

arbitration clauses, and preserving the rights of people

22

to sue, and your view would sweep all of those aside, and

23

I'm concerned that that wasn't what Congress had in mind.

24
25

MR. FARR:
two points, if I may.

Well, Justice O'Connor, let me make
Of course I would say that the

1

Court ought to give meaning to the words that Congress

2

used, as I hope to explain this morning.

3

that those words support a narrow interpretation of the

4

act.
But before, perhaps,

5

I don't think

I turn to that,

I'd like to

6

make clear that the issue regarding the construction of

7

the scope of the act overlaps with but is not the same

8

issue, precisely, as the issue whether the act preempts

9

State law.

10

The Court has said that the Federal act does not

11

occupy the field, and does not preempt all State law.

12

example, I think it is understood now that State laws of

13

general applicability can be applied to arbitration

14

agreements and, indeed, the language of section 2 itself,

15

which provides that they can be provoked on grounds

16

applicable to any contract would suggest that, and the

17

court in the Stanford University case indicated that the

18

parties could in fact incorporate State law.

19

QUESTION:

For

Mr. Farr, can I ask -- this is a very

20

interesting point that you're making.

If Alabama had a

21

statute similar to, say, I think Georgia has one of these

22

statutes that, there's a dollar limit and they exclude

23

consumer contracts of this kind.

24

Federal act would not apply here, if Alabama had a statute

25

like that, rather than just a 100 percent policy

Would you say, then, the

1

against --

2

MR. FARR:

No, I would say, without knowing

3

exactly the details of the transaction, the act might well

4

apply but would not necessarily preempt whatever the State

5

law is.
QUESTION:

6

Where the State law says certain

7

contracts are not subject to arbitration, certain consumer

8

contracts are not, how could it apply without preempting

9

it?

That's what I don't quite understand.
MR. FARR:

10

Well, if that's -- if the definition

11

of the law is a very narrow law that is aimed at

12

arbitration agreements itself,

13

would be preempted --

I think in fact it probably

14

QUESTION:

I see.

15

MR. FARR:

-- to the extent the Federal act

16

applies.

17

But the point that I'm making is that State law

18

as a whole is not preempted by the Federal Arbitration

19

Act.

There may be particular State laws --

20

QUESTION:

You mean, the rules of whether the

21

company is liable on the merits are not preempted, you

22

mean.

23

MR. FARR:

Well, I mean, perhaps even rules that

24

go to the construction of the contract, or rules that deal

25

with -7

1

QUESTION:

The rules that deal with whether or

2

not the Arbitration Clause is enforceable would always be

3

preempted, I would think.

4

MR. FARR:

Well, let me try to use an example.

5

If, for example, a contract was signed by

6

someone representing that they have authority to sign for

7

a corporation and they do not, that can be applied to make

8

the arbitration agreement, as well as any other parts of

9

the contract, unenforceable.

10

It's possible if a State law, for example,

11

had -- a State had a law that said, all provisions that

12

are not on the face of the contract must be separately

13

initialed by the parties, then it seems to me that one

14

could say that's not something that aims at arbitration,

15

not something that is intended to make arbitration more

16

difficult itself.

17

QUESTION:

If the State law, as I think the

18

Georgia law does say, said that for an arbitration clause

19

to be enforceable that paragraph of the contract has to be

20

initialed, even though nothing else has to, that would be

21

unenforceable.

22

MR. FARR:

That would be.

That would be

23

preempted by the Federal, no question, and I should make

24

clear to -- just by way of clearing up any of this

25

introduction, as far as this case is concerned there is no

1

question in our mind that the Alabama law being applied

2

here has to be preempted.

3

we are talking about here says, we do not enforce

4

arbitration agreements simply because they're an

5

arbitration agreement.

6

QUESTION:

This is -- the Alabama law that

Mr. Farr, may I ask you to be

7

entirely clear about this?

I believe that Justice Stevens

8

was referring to his position in Southland that the State

9

could carve out certain kinds of contracts like franchise

10

agreements, and you have given, do I understand you

11

correctly, to say no, that can't be done?

12

MR. FARR:

I think I can't give an absolutely

13

clear answer for every case, because it depends on the

14

particular nature of the State law.

15

believe the correct analysis would be is that one would

16

look at the nature of the State law, how broadly does the

17

State law apply?

18

including arbitration agreements, that seems to me it puts

19

it on the side where it is not preempted.

20

exclusively to arbitration agreements, it clearly puts it

21

on the side of the line where it is preempted.

22

At least the way I

If it applies to all the agreements,

QUESTION:

Why is that, Mr. Farr?

If it applies

I mean, it

23

seems to me the conflict with Federal policy is just as

24

severe in either case.

25

against a State for singling out arbitration agreements, I

Whether it's sort of a penalty

1

mean, as far as the conflicts with Federal law is

2

concerned, whether it's a general law or a specific law

3

addressed to arbitration agreements, it has the same

4

result.
MR. FARR:

5

But I think one starts with the

6

language of section 2, and the language of section 2 says

7

that agreements to arbitrate, within the field, which I

8

will discuss this morning, are enforceable save on grounds

9

that are sufficient for revocation of any contract and,

10

therefore, it seems to me that, when one is looking at

11

State law seeking to be applied to an arbitration

12

agreement and seeking to say that it makes it enforceable,

13

one -- the first inquiry, naturally, one makes is, is this

14

grounds for revocation of any contract?

15

QUESTION:

Then the answer to the question I

16

posed is, you cannot carve out from arbitration specific

17

kinds of contracts.

18

contracts, franchise contracts, particular categories of

19

contracts to exempt them from arbitration.
MR. FARR:

20

You can't carve out consumer

From arbitration specifically, I do

21

not believe that you can consistently with the Federal

22

act.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Farr, given the language of

24

section 2, though, the key language seems to be a contract

25

evidencing a transaction involving commerce.

1

You wouldn't say that that language would cover

2

everything that Congress might have covered had it wished

3

to exercise its Commerce Clause power to the limit, would

4

you?
MR. FARR:

5

Well, this, I should point out, is

6

not a statute in which Congress has made specific findings

7

to which the Court has to defer saying that we believe a

8

specific activity affects interstate commerce and then

9

directly regulates that activity.
With that exception, though, however, we do

10
11

believe that the correct reading of this language in fact

12

does indicate that Congress intended to reach all

13

contracts that are within its power under the Commerce

14

Clause.

15

word "involving" is, among its meanings, synonymous with

16

the word "affecting."

17
18

The word "involving" commerce, for example, the

QUESTION:

But it's certainly, it can also be

read to be less sweeping than "affecting."

19

MR. FARR:

It could, I agree.

20

QUESTION:

"Affecting" has been almost a word of

21

art in our Commerce Clause jurisdiction, whereas

22

"involving" hasn't.

23

MR. FARR:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the fact is

24

that if one goes back, I think one cannot fairly say that

25

the use of the word "affecting" as a term of art was

1

common and recognized in 1925.

2

fairly be attributed to Congress until sometime, probably

3

after Schechter and perhaps even further after that, in

4

the late 1930's.

5

I don't think that can

So if one is looking here -- and the first thing

6

one notices is that Congress, of course, did not use the

7

word "in" commerce, even though that is, in fact, used in

8

section 1 of the act at a different point.

9

word "involving," and the Court in 1923, in a case cited

It used the

10

in our brief, United States v. Luskey, at least gave that

11

word quite a generous reading in another context.

12

Furthermore, it seems, quite frankly, that when

13

the House report talks about having relied on the

14

interstate commerce power, it talked about that power, as

15

I mentioned before, extending to contracts relating to

16

interstate commerce, and on the two occasions, it seems to

17

me, where the Court has given some indication of how it

18

was- reading that language, it seems apparent on both

19

occasion that it read it very, very broadly.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

What about Bernhardt v. Polygraphic?

It didn't seem to read it very, very broadly there.
MR. FARR:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think in

23

fact it did read the language broadly, if one looks at the

24

inquiry that the Court made.

25

whether the -- essentially the duties this person were

It said, we first look to

12

1

performing were in commerce, whether the person was

2

producing goods for commerce, or whether the person was

3

engaged in activities that affected commerce, which is

4

precisely the test that we think is the right test.
QUESTION:

5
6

Well, it didn't really say it had to

do, it said it did not do any of those three things.

7

But you would not deny, would you, that that

8

contract could be regulated by the Federal -- under the

9

Commerce power, the contract involved in Bernhardt.
MR. FARR:

10

Well, the contract involved in

11

Bernhardt, it's not clear from that, there's almost no

12

discussion of what the facts are as to what the duties

13

were that the person undertook.

14

My own view is that Bernhardt on the facts would

15

come out the other way, but I think the test, at least the

16

inquiry,

17

should apply, whether in fact it's either in commerce,

18

whether it's producing goods for commerce, or whether the

19

activity affects commerce.

20
21
22

is exactly the right inquiry that the Court

QUESTION:

Well, that's not the way Justice

Douglas stated the question.
Let me ask you this:

are there any appellate

23

court decisions or are there a significant number -- the

24

act's been on the books now for 70 years.

25

consumer contracts that appellate courts have said are

Have there been

1

subject to this statute?
MR. FARR:

2

I don't think, at least in one's that

3

I'm aware of, that there are decisions about consumer

4

contracts one way or the other.
QUESTION:

5

Mr. Farr, as I understand your

6

proposal, you would decide whether this contract involves,

7

or whether it evidences a transaction involving commerce

8

ex post.

9

a sale of widgets, you wouldn't look at that contract to

That is, if there's a contract for the purchase

10

see whether it specifically contemplates the

11

transportation of widgets interstate commerce, but rather

12

you'd look to see what actually transpired, isn't that

13

right?

14

MR. FARR:

That's correct.

15

QUESTION:

So at the time you sign the contract,

16

you don't really know whether it's going to be arbitrable

17

under the Federal law or not, do you?

18

MR. FARR:

Well, when you're signing the

19

contract you are agreeing to arbitrate your disputes under

20

the agreement, and I think the natural presumption is that

21

you are in fact intending to go ahead and agree.

22

QUESTION:

Yes, but one side can be rolling the

23

dice and saying, you know, there is -- I'm signing this

24

standard form contract that has an arbitration provision,

25

but inasmuch as I don't intend this contract to actually

1

involve interstate materials, my contemplation is that

2

this thing won't be covered.

3

It seems like a very strange test as to whether

4

a contract is enforceable, or as to what it imposes on the

5

parties, to look to later events and see what happens

6

later, but that is really what you're proposing.

7

If it turns out that the contract involves

8

interstate commerce, we will retroactively say that

9

Federal law requires the arbitration agreement to be

10

enforced despite State law.

11

doesn't involve interstate commerce, then we won't.

12

If it turns out that it

I find that -- I don't know of any other

13

instance in the law where we sit around and wait to decide

14

whether the provision is valid or not.

15

MR. FARR:

Well, Justice Scalia, it seems to me

16

that in fact when Congress includes a reference to

17

interstate commerce as a jurisdictional nexus in a

18

statute, that the rule frankly is exactly the opposite.

19

am not aware of any Federal statute in which Congress

20

requires a nexus to interstate commerce for jurisdictional

21

reasons in which Congress requires the person subjected to

22

the law to have an intent about interstate commerce --

23

QUESTION:

But they are not laws --

24

MR. FARR:

-- in order to be covered.

25

QUESTION:

But they are not laws involving

1

contracting.

This is a law specifically involving

2

contracting.

It validates and renders enforceable despite

3

State law the particular contractual provision, and you

4

usually don't validate or invalidate contracts ex post.
MR. FARR:

5

Well, it involves contracts which

6

relate to transactions involving commerce, so one is

7

looking --

8

9

QUESTION:

More precisely, it involves contracts

evidencing a transaction involving commerce, which could

10

be read to mean that the contract must show on its face

11

that it involves interstate commerce, so if the contract

12

says, I will buy and sell widgets now located in Ohio

13

which will be brought to me in Pennsylvania, then it would

14

qualify, but if it just says,

15

it doesn't qualify.

16

MR. FARR:

I will buy and sell widgets,

That's a possible reading.
I agree it's a possible reading.

17

What I'm saying is that I really don't think the reading

18

makes any sense, because what that attributes to Congress

19

is an intent, first of all, as I say, to require some sort

20

of subjective intention about interstate commerce, which I

21

think would be unprecedented with respect to any Federal

22

law, and the second thing --

23

QUESTION:

Not a subjective intention at all, an

24

objective one, one that is recited in the contract.

25

it's not recited, it's not there.

Whatever their

If

subjective intentions were, we don't care.

that -- I mean, this in a sense is perhaps a variation of

6

what the Alabama court applied as its test and what Judge

Lumbard applied -- is any explanation for why, in fact,

Congress would want to put that kind of limitation into

on the face of a contract, and this is a form contract,

6

the person, in this case Terminix, drawing the contract,

7

would say on the face of it this is a contract involving

commerce, and I guess the consumer wouldn't have much of a
choice about what the contract says.
MR. FARR:

10

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I believe

11

that's correct, but in a way that seems to me to point up

12

why the real question ought to be whether the transaction

13

does, in fact, involve interstate commerce.
I don't think that Congress wanted people to be

14
15

able to enforce arbitration agreements outside what

16

Congress' power would typically be simply by making a

17

recitation in the contract, so the question would still

18

be, even if there was the recitation in the contract, does

the contract in fact involve interstate commerce, and I

20

think that's what the test ought to be even if there is no

recitation in the contract about what -QUESTION:

the fact that a parent company of a contracting party is

relatively modest size, I suppose.

agreement, there are materials moving across State lines

8

in order to perform the contract -- I would be hard-

9

pressed to say that one contract viewed in isolation has a

10

substantial effect on interstate commerce, but I don't

11

think that that is what Congress is requiring, again, when

12

it is using the term, transactions involving commerce.

3

I

mean, the -QUESTION:

You mentioned at the start of your

argument that in many statutes Congress makes findings

that the particular activity affects commerce.
Actually, the result of your argument here is

just as if Congress did make those findings in this case.

9

That's the purport of your argument, is it not, i.e. that

20

arbitration contracts affect interstate commerce?

21

that --

22

MR. FARR:

I mean,

Well, I -- no, I think particular --

23

particular arbitration contracts are found within that

24

definition.

For example, Congress has criminal laws that

apply to transactions in or affecting commerce, and the

2

courts must decide whether in fact a particular

3

transaction involves -- I mean, excuse me, is in or

4

affecting commerce based on that standard.
Now, the courts apply a generous standard,

5
6

assuming, I think correctly in those cases, as we think

7

here, that Congress is intending to exercise its power to

8

the fullest extent.

9

QUESTION:

Suppose we replicate a situation like

10

Wickard v. Filburn, where one farmer in Ohio agrees with

11

his neighbor to sell him 50 bushels of wheat, and they

12

have an arbitration agreement in it, and nobody claims

13

that the wheat ever went anywhere except across the local

14

road, but I suppose if you apply Wickard v. Filburn you'd

15

say, well, if he hadn't sold that 50 bushels of wheat to

16

his neighbor, he might have sold it to somebody else that

17

might have baked some bread that went in interstate

18

commerce.

19
20
21

Now, is that contract subject to the Federal
Arbitration Act?
MR. FARR:

Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think so,
I think there,

22

in the absence of congressional findings.

23

the relationship by any of the normal standards that the

24

court applies without findings would be too attenuated.

25

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Farr, may I ask you a related

2

question?

3

as an implicit finding, what does it add?

4

why is the act any different with this clause from what it

5

would be without it?

If the clause in question is not to be regarded
In other words,

Because if the act did not have this arguable

6

7

limitation on it, and it were applied to a transaction

8

which is claimed not to involve commerce in any way, that

9

would be the defense to the attempt to enforce the

10

arbitration agreement, which will be the case here.

11

So if it simply is a jurisdictional statement,

12

but it is not a finding by Congress that all arbitration

13

are within the jurisdiction,

14

has.

15

MR. FARR:

I don't see what function it

Well, Your Honor, I think, again, it

16

serves the same function as defining the class of

17

contracts that Congress was intending to reach, just as,

18

when Congress uses the terms, affecting commerce in

19

criminal statutes, it is indicating what particular acts

20

and transactions it's trying to reach by those statutes,

21

and if one steps back for a second and --

QUESTION:

In other words, Congress -- you're

4

saying, in effect, that Congress is saying to the Federal

5

courts, when -- and parties, I suppose, when you refuse to

6

apply this agreement to contracts that do not involve

7

commerce, you're right.

8

the provision.

9

MR. FARR:

That's basically the function of

The Congress is saying, we did not

10

intend to, but I think that's important, because in 1925,

11

when Congress was enacting this legislation, it was

12

enacting it against a background of hostility towards

13

enforcement of arbitration agreements, hostility from the

14

very courts that were going to have to interpret the act.

15

QUESTION:

In your judgment, in the absence of

this limitation, would there have been a risk of facial

invalidity to the statute?

22

MR. FARR:

Oh, I think there would have been a

very definite risk in 1925.
QUESTION:

So you think that's what they were

guarding against.
MR. FARR:

I mean, Congress was very concerned

in 1925, and I think Judge Medina says this many years

24

later in Robert Lorance, that unless it was very careful

and put this on sound jurisdictional grounds, the courts,

would invalidate it as beyond the scope of Congress'

QUESTION:

Mr. Farr, can I just ask you one --

statutory construction to the express language of the act.

I would like to draw into that the legislative history,

11

because we draw different conclusions from the legislative

12

history as the ones that Mr. Farr has outlined for you.

13

First, the choice of the word "involving"

14

commerce we believe is important, because, as the Chief

15

Justice has mentioned, traditionally the word "affecting"

16

commerce has been used when Congress wanted to use all of

17

its constitutional power.

The question was asked whether that was a term

of art in 1925.

- what we can say is that they were aware that they had

about in 1925, or whether they read Supreme Court

might have thought it meant, we cite Your Honors to the

Now, whether that was a specific language that

3

Congress had reference to 2 years later when they passed

era, and the same language was used again in the United

isn't it in commerce if I contract with someone to bring

Why isn't that a

It clearly is.

My difficulty with your

imagine, particularly if the performance of the contract

10

involved consumers, that Congress could have intended to

regulate that kind of transaction.
QUESTION:

12

Well, but that's a different point.

13

That's a different point, and the point you were making, I

14

thought, was that this contract did not -- was not in

if you just look at its face, but if you look at the way

it played out, what was actually performed, surely that

involved commerce.

The way this contract was performed

was that Terminix, through its local office in the same

were made in States other than Alabama and sent there --

we have no way of knowing whether that is true or not --

of connections with interstate commerce is not what

Did we just get it wrong?

MR. CHASON:

Your Honor, I would feel that in

the first place that statement in Perry v. Thomas is
dictum because it was a State court case where that
finding was not necessary to the holding of the case.
Now, questions about the purposes for which -the breadth of the purposes of liberal Federal policy and
so forth might fairly be applied to questions like in
Perry v. Thomas, where the issue is not so much what is
the jurisdictional reach of the statute, but, rather, the
question is, given that the statute reaches this problem,
what is the scope of the arbitration agreement?
We would submit that those are two very
different inquiries, that the jurisdictional reach of the
statute involves matters of federalism which this Court in
the Gregory v. Ashcroft line of cases has in recent years
relied on, requiring a plain statement rule that

You're saying that this agreement, whether this case

it's very important --we don't know exactly what Congress

but what we do know is that we have these two cases that

We also know that in the subcommittee hearings

there was a brief filed by Julius Cohen, who was the

At the time that he wrote that brief -- and let

noted that Congress not only had the power to regulate

me that normally what this Court has done is first

determine what the jurisdictional reach of the statute is

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR, III

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

7

MR. FARR:

8

I have just two points that I would like to

9

make.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

First, with respect to the contemplation of the

10

parties, it has yet at least been explained to my ear why

11

Congress would want the scope of the act to turn on the

12

parties' contemplation about interstate commerce.

13

The logic of this argument, as I understand it,

14

is that even though the parties solemnly agree in a

15

written contract to arbitrate their disputes, if they do

16

not, on the face of the same contract, say something about

17

interstate commerce, it means that they are not intending

18

Federal law to apply.

19

In the first place, I don't think that is a

20

logical inference to draw from it and, secondly, I can't

21

imagine that Congress would intend that that undisclosed

22

inference be the basis for deciding whether Federal law

23

applied or not.

24
25

The second point I'd like to make is that one
has to look, I think, at the reasons that Congress wanted

several thoughts in mind, 1) that it would provide some

delays, or reduce delays that were associated with

6

disputes that arise out of agreements.

Now, what you have in this particular case is

10

involves interstate commerce, for sale of a service

11

involving goods to a citizen in another State.

12

Now, what is there about that contract that

13

makes it inappropriate for arbitration, as Congress viewed

dealings such as a farmer selling his potatoes to an out-

16

of-State dealer, and makes reference to that clearly, I

21

but in fact, arbitration in contracts like this also can

22

reduce costs, can reduce the burden on the courts, and

23

ultimately can reduce prices to the very consumers who

24

sign contracts like this, and those policies clearly apply

25

to what everybody agrees is the scope of the act.
