ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN WESLEY HALL, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HALL:

10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case presents a fundamental issue of the

11

interrelationship between the common law and the Bill of

12

Rights, particularly the Fourth Amendment.

13

here on a very limited grant of cert because of the stark

14

way the issue was decided by the Arkansas supreme court.

15

That is, that there is no knock-and-announce requirement

16

in the Fourth Amendment.

17

The case came

In response to our briefs, in response to that

18

petition for cert and the grant of cert, my opponents have

19

tried to turn the issue on its head, in effect turning the

20

Fourth Amendment on its head, and I'll just cut right to

21

the chase of the argument.

22

What they're saying is - - the Solicitor General

23

says, the more drugs you've got, the more right you have

24

to an announcement.

25

right you have to announcement, and then the State's

The less drugs you've got, the less

position is that if you're completely innocent you really

2

don't have any rights at all, and I submit to you that

3

that turns the Fourth Amendment on its head.

4

Everybody in this country has a right to be free

5

in their home from unreasonable searches and seizures, and

6

this falls within the reasonableness clause whether you're

7

innocent or you're guilty.

9

of any wrongdoing, and they were subjected to the same

11

we tried to get Ricki Cates, Sharlene Wilson's son --

12

QUESTION:

Well wait.

As to the three who were

13

totally innocent, they would have been subjected to a

14

search that they didn't deserve even if there had been a

15

knock- and-announce.

16

MR. HALL:

That's true.

17

QUESTION:

They got a warrant based on something

18

that the fourth occupant was doing, and the other three

19

had to be subjected to that, so that doesn't really carry

20

a whole lot of weight, it seems to me.

21

MR. HALL:

I think it carries weight because in

22

the context of, the innocent inside a home have as much

23

right to a knock-and-announce as the guilty.

24

QUESTION:

Did the three live in the home?

QUESTION:

-- I think you're making some

17

generalizations that perhaps require a little more

18

refinement than you're giving them.
QUESTION:

19

Surely your position doesn't depend

20

upon the presence or the absence of other people who - -

21

persons other than are named in the warrant.

22

MR. HALL:

It doesn't.

QUESTION:

Your position is exactly the same if

24

your client were the only person in the house, isn't that

correct?

MR. HALL:

1

That's true, but I think it

2

underscores the issue of the innocent having as much right

3

as the guilty, in this case because there were three other

4

people in the house, and as I was referring to the record,

5

at page 379 we tried to get Ricki Cates to testify at

QUESTION:

-- make it admissible?

MR. HALL:

-- bring in the plaintiff inevitable

That's the useless gesture exception

to the knock-and-announce requirement.
But let me take this one step backward, that the

State never raised an exception below.

QUESTION:

Well, presumably it would be open to

the Court if it had to go back.

9

MR. HALL:

Well, you have other cases.

It would

10

be open for the trial court when it goes back, if it goes

11

back.

12

QUESTION:

Yes.

13

MR. HALL:

But the State could raise, I suppose,

14

any ground, and in this case I'll concede that all three

15

grounds are possible.

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

17

MR. HALL:

But there's not any concrete proof on

18

anything, because at the suppression hearing the State put

19

on no evidence and cross-examined no witnesses.

20

no argument.

21

judge said motion denied, with no findings, so we would

22

have to go back, but I would agree that on remand the

State would have the opportunity to put on proof as to all

of these issues.

What proof is needed?

What they found would have been found with a

Are you saying

It might not have been discovered because somebody

You wouldn't use that as an

excuse, surely.
MR. HALL:

11

No, but destruction of evidence under

12

Arkansas law is a rather minor felony compared to the

13

possession of a drug.

14

QUESTION:

Well, but that isn't the point.

15

point is whether it is a defense to the inevitable

discovery rule.

Well --

could possibly be a defense to the inevitable discovery

22

MR. HALL:

Well, inevitable discovery is not an

issue in this case, either, because that's not within the

1

question?

Is the destruction of evidence, or the

2

potential thereof, an exception to the inevitable

3

discovery rule were we to adopt one?
MR. HALL:

4

No, because the State is using the

5

inevitable discovery rule as an opportunity to salvage the

6

search, but then on the other hand they argue we have to

7

enter without announcement to make sure it's there, so if

8

they have to enter without announcement to make sure it's
there, that's not inevitable discovery.

QUESTION:

They're planning

They're trying to ensure it's there by

Mr. Hall, does it make a difference

13

that in this case the police went through a screen door

14

that was closed but not locked?

15

there a constitutionally relevant distinction between that

16

and ramming the door open?

17

MR. HALL:

Would there be - - is

There could be on the issue of

18

reasonableness, and in this case it could also go to

1

whether or not they could look through the door and see

20

that they were police officers, because it was a screen

21

door.

22

Now, there is -QUESTION:

23

this was rather mild, was it not?

The screen door that

24

was shut but not locked, the police as they entered

said -- identified themselves --

MR. HALL:

1

They identified themselves.

They had

There

2

no weapons drawn.

3

is some evidence in the record, but it's not a part of the

4

suppression hearing, that they heard Sharlene Wilson

5

running to the bathroom to dispose of drugs, and in her

6

cross-examination at the trial on the merits she admitted

7

that she was in the bathroom flushing drugs after she

8

previously denied it.

9

so - -

10

QUESTION:

She denied it and then admitted it,

Your position is, I take it, that

11

there is a general rule that the search is unreasonable,

12

prima facie unreasonable, if they enter without knocking

13

and announce, in the absence of some exceptions which are

14

not before us.

16
17

Is that in a nutshell --

MR. HALL:

That's correct, and the

reasonableness -QUESTION:

So that's why that covers this case.

18

This case may be on the fringes if we did not have a

19

general rule, but if we have a general rule, this case

20

falls within it, and that's the end of the case.

21

MR. HALL:

It would go back to determine the

22

reasonableness overall.

The State could plead that they

23

really knew that police were out there, therefore they

24

were not surprised.

25

presence of a gun created a peril issue, which is

holstered when they came in.

3

they had a serious dispute.

They didn't it -- consider

And then the destruction of property, the

4
5

destruction of the evidence, I submit to you this case is

6

a good example that the destruction of evidence overall

7

really doesn't mean a whole lot.
QUESTION:

8

9

How much difference is there between

the knock-and-announce rule as a part of the Fourth

10

Amendment with some exceptions to it, which I gather is

11

your position, and the position taken by the Solicitor

12

General that the knock-and-announce rule is a factor to be

13

considered in determining overall reasonableness?

14

MR. HALL:

I look at it a different way, that

15

the Fourth Amendment requires announcement.

16

exceptions are based on reasonableness, and the exceptions

17

can come into play and conceivably other exceptions could

18

be envisioned in the future.

19

QUESTION:

The

Well, so what difference does it

20

make, say, in a typical case if you apply one rule or the

21

other?

22

MR. HALL:

It's still -- knock-and-announce

23

becomes a Fourth Amendment requirement because it's part

24

of reasonableness.

you would have to -- at least if you found that, you'd

have to remand it back to decide whether or not what the

QUESTION:

Can I ask about that?

This is just a

technical question, but you've been talking about what was

Isn't that the

MR. HALL:

Yes.

13

QUESTION:

Well, there they say, you know, was

14

she in the bathroom, say I didn't see weapons drawn, but

15

he says, I went straight to the bathroom where Mrs. Wilson

16

was.

Why?

17

Apparently she'd run to the bathroom.
Now, we know she'd run to the bathroom to flush

18

the drugs down the toilet, and so why would you have to --

19

and you say in your brief that it's a common law

20

exception, destruction of evidence, because you say

21

possible destruction of evidence, so why isn't it right

22

there in the suppression hearing that she ran to the

23

bathroom to flush the -- you know, you have to draw the

24

inference she ran there to flush the drugs down the

25

toilet.

MR. HALL:

That's true.

2

QUESTION:

We need not allow it, but we

certainly may allow it.
QUESTION:

4

And we say -- the question presented

5

is whether the knock-and-announce rule of the common law

is constitutionally mandated under the Fourth Amendment.

7

Now, if we were to conclude that the common rule

8

law knock-and-announce rule is not constitutionally

9

mandated under the Fourth Amendment, but that it is

10

factor to be considered, then surely we can decide on

11

these facts whether the factoring was done properly, if we

12

choose to do so.

13

MR. HALL:

I think you probably could, and I

14

would concede that on remand I don't know that the proof

15

would get much better.

16

officers that were there would be called, instead of just

Counsel, suppose the police don't

Is it unreasonable for the police to

that there is a strong probability, or a significant

probability, that the contraband will be - - that there

14

will be an attempt to dispose of it by flushing it down

15

the drain?

16

Is that an unreasonable assumption?
MR. HALL:

It's not, but I want to counter that

17

with another view, that in this case, for example, by the

18

time they got the search warrant, they had charges on her

19

for three separate sales, and she got 31 years as a result

20

of the sales.
As a result of the search, she got an $11,000

3

The Fourth Amendment requires under the reasonableness

interests of the State against the interest of the

occupant, because this Court has recognized that when the

officers are in the process of executing a warrant, they

put themselves at great risk.

Under that test, Your Honor, the

Police safety is a legitimate and weighty State

balance those interests, the interest weighs heavily in

favor of the State, and this Court has previously adopted

such rules.

15

police can require the occupant to get out of the car. In

that particular instance, the Court balanced the interest

utilized police safety as a basis for that rule.

The officers

to knock and announce where they're not going to destroy

no reason for thinking there's any danger, and there's

this pedigree in history saying that it's unreasonable

under those circumstances.

14

GENERAL BRYANT:

What's the answer to that?
Your Honor, in this case the

15

officers had a search warrant, and there was a probable

16

cause requirement met that there was illegal contraband on

17

premises plus there was a weapon on premises, and in

18

situations where the officers serve a warrant, they are at

19

great risk, and the rule that Arkansas is suggesting would

20

provide for the protection of officers, the protection of

21

occupants by standards if present, as well as legitimate

22

law enforcement principles of preventing the escape of

23

suspects, preventing the destruction of evidence, and this

which will give the officers firm guidance in the field.

They are not placed in the position of deciding whether I

MR. DREEBEN:

Anybody that

Kennedy.

There may be a distinction, for example, if

9

based on confidential informants the police know that all

10

the drugs in question are stored in relatively

11

indestructible crates, and they are executing a search

12

warrant at a warehouse.

13

They probably could not assume that any

14

destruction of the evidence that they were searching for

15

could take place, but in the average situation, when

may reasonably assume that the occupants of the dwelling

will make some effort to destroy the contraband.

warrant -- whatever you're looking for, with few

exceptions, bales of marijuana, but if it's, you know,

4

stolen jewelry, chuck it down the toilet, whatever.
It seems to me you're making an exception that

5
6

swallows up the general rule.
MR. DREEBEN:

7

Well, I don't think, Justice

8

Scalia, that it entirely swallows the rule.

It certainly

9

would apply to anything that could readily and easily

10

destroyed through indoor plumbing, or through -- for

11

example, the cases have dealt with raids on gambling

12

joints in which the slips are kept, the betting slips are

3

kept on flash paper which can easily be put in water, and

4

that's it's water soluble.
But if a search warrant were being executed for

stolen televisions, there would be no reason to believe

that the occupants would have any means of being able to

destroy the televisions.
QUESTION:

I just wonder whether that's a good

enough exception to come in without knocking into a house,

3

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I -- my response to that is

4

twofold.

First, we believe that the exceptions to a

5

knock-and-announce rule, if you want to put it that way,

6

that we advocate are consistent with the way the doctrine

7

has developed in common law cases in this country, but -QUESTION:

8

9

In that respect, do you make a

difference between what the statute requires of Federal

10

officers and what the Fourth Amendment requires of all

11

officers?

Is there something more because there's a

3

MR. DREEBEN:

No, Justice Ginsburg.

I think

4

that 3 09 has been interpreted by the lower courts as

5

incorporating the same kind of reasonableness analysis as

6

we're advocating under the theory that 3 09, which was

7

enacted in

8

that the common law recognized that when it would

9

frustrate the object of a search to knock and announce

20

before entering, it wasn't required, or when the police

21

faced a risk of danger from entering with a knock --

22

May I ask a broader question based on

23

that statement?

precisely the same as this Court's construction of section

3109 insofar as we've decided 3109 cases?
MR. DREEBEN:

2

I don't think it would be

3

precisely the same as this Court's construction of 3109 in

4

every respect.

5

would differ from the 3109 cases is the application of the

6

exclusionary rule.

7

The most significant respect in which I

In the cases that this Court had, Miller and

8

Sabbath, under 3109 there was a fairly broad application

9

of the exclusionary rule, which may have been appropriate

10

on the facts of those cases because they involved

11

warrantless entries to a home to make an arrest, and

12

therefore there is a difference in these cases.

13

QUESTION:

Apart from the question of remedy, in

14

terms of the scope of whether there's a violation of the

15

Fourth Amendment, would you say the law would be the same

16

as whether there's a violation of 3109?

17

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, none of this Court's cases

18

under 3109 evaluated whether there were exceptions,

19

because the facts didn't present them, and to that extent

20

those cases simply didn't present the problem that we have

21

here.

We don't take issue with the idea that -QUESTION:

Well, let me ask you in a different

way, then.

No.

result --

QUESTION:

MR. DREEBEN:

QUESTION:

As the Fourth Amendment.
--as the Fourth Amendment.

Mr. Dreeben, I take it that in our

10

decision in Warden v. Hayden, which I guess was the late

11

sixties, we have already departed from the common law in

12

construing the Fourth Amendment, since we there held that

13

you could search for evidence and the common law didn't

14

permit it.

15

MR. DREEBEN:

That is correct, Chief Justice

16

Rehnquist, and that was my second response to Justice

17

Scalia's comment on the common law.

18

simply frozen common law rules in searches and seizures

19

into constitutional law, but has used the common law

20

background, departing from it when reasonable

21

justifications existed.

QUESTION:

The Court has not

I understand that, but that's -- but

23

it's a further question to say not only are we going to

25

before, but the obtaining of that evidence we are also

1

going to allow to dispense with the common law requirement

2

of knock and announce.

3

That's a big additional step, it seems to me,

4

and I'm not sure that simply to say you can get it means

5

that you also have to say, moreover, when -- if knocking

6

and announce wouldn't permit you to get it, you can

7

dispense with knock and announce.

8

an additional step.

9

MR. DREEBEN:

That seems to me quite

Well, the American common law from

10

very early cases in this country did recognize that when

11

it would be counterproductive to knock and announce before

12

making the entry, such as by provoking a felon within to

13

use violence to repel officers who were there to arrest

14

them, then knock and announce need not be complied with,

15

and that is the very principle that we are contending for

16

here today with respect to the risk of violence.

17

QUESTION:

Do I understand you to be saying,

18

though, that this is largely an academic discussion,

19

because if you have a warrant, then you can break the door

20

down, you can be brutal, it doesn't matter because of the

21

inevitable discovery rule.

22

MR. DREEBEN:

For most of the evidence that is

23

acquired under a search warrant, that is true, although I

24

wouldn't --

Well, why isn't the same reasoning,

You would simply argue, well, if they had done

MR. DREEBEN:

Isn't the structure

I don't think so, Justice Souter,

8

because the presumption that if police had applied for a

9

warrant they would have gotten it is a very different

10

thing from saying they did go to the magistrate, they did

11

get the warrant, and they are --

12

QUESTION:

Is it any more bizarre than saying

13

that if they had knocked and announced they would have

14

done the right thing and they just didn't happen to knock

question is, they could have done what the Fourth

Amendment requires.

MR. DREEBEN:

That is true, but this Court's

13

cases that have examined police entries into dwellings

14

that were done both under warrant and not under warrant

15

have recognized that the evidence that is acquired under

16

warrant is the fruit of the warrant.

17

Even if a warrantless entry had previously

18

occurred that enabled the police to see all of the

19

evidence, and that thereby would justify suppression of

20

the evidence if that's all there was, doesn't require

suppression of evidence when there is a valid warrant, and

22

that's essentially the position we're taking here.

they knocked or whether they didn't knock.
MR. DREEBEN:

That is true, Justice Souter, as

to the tangible evidence that they seize, but it may not
be true as to some of the things that they observe upon
making an immediate entry, and if the entry is unlawful, a
court could suppress things that they observe - QUESTION:
