ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS C. COOK

ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT WYOMING

10

MR. COOK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This case is an original action brought by the

11

12

State of Nebraska against the State of Wyoming in 1986

13

involving the equitable apportionment of the North Platte

14

River.

15

Questions involving the North Platte are not new

16

to the Court.

17

by the Court in 1945, and unlike the case of Kansas v.

18

Colorado that you've just heard, the Court is not called

19

upon in this case to decide questions of fact.

20

the Court has before it exceptions of the special master's

21

report on Nebraska's third motion to amend its 1986

22

petition, and Wyoming's first motion to amend its 1987

23

counterclaims.

24
25

The North Platte was equitably apportioned

QUESTION:

conclusion.

We're still waiting to go to trial.

MR. COOK:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Wyoming

3

brings four exceptions.

4

denial of Wyoming's first amended counterclaim and cross­

5

claim, second the announced intent to have a trial on

6

issues below Tri-State Diversion Dam, despite the

7

exclusion of that in other parts of his ruling, third, the

8

inclusion of Horse Creek in the claims Nebraska can

9

litigate, and fourth, the inclusion of the groundwater

10
11

The first regards the recommended

issue in the litigation.
The decision on the issues raised by the

12

parties' exceptions is crucial, now, to break this endless

13

circle of debate about which claims are in this case, what

14

the geographic limits of this case are, and that decision

15

then will instruct the parties and will shape the course

16

of trial in the future.

17

My argument will focus on first the unfairness

18

of the special master's recommendation to deny Wyoming's

19

first counterclaim and first cross-claim, and second, upon

20

the impact of the special master's proposed trial plans,

21

the impact those plans will have on the certainty and

22

stability of the Court's 1945 apportionment that ended

23

Nebraska's apportionment at Tri-State Diversion Dam.

24
25

With regard to the special master's
recommendations on Wyoming's first counterclaim and first

1

cross-claim, Wyoming believes that it is unfair, on the

2

one hand, to deny a trial or any affirmative relief at

3

this stage on Wyoming's claims that Nebraska and the

4

United States circumvent the apportionment, when on the

5

other hand the Court and the special master would

6

entertain a trial on very similar issues raised by

7

Nebraska with regard to the development of tributaries in

8

Wyoming.

9

To get to the point where the special master did

10

to deny Wyoming's first counterclaims, he saw too much in

11

a decision in 1993 of this Court that said there are no

12

current limits on the State of Nebraska's diversions in

13

this pivotal reach of the river between Whalen Diversion

14

Dam and Tri-State Diversion Dam.

15

answered the question completely with respect to Wyoming's

16

counterclaims, but it did not.

17

He found that that

Wyoming's counterclaim is that Nebraska

18

circumvents.

19

participates in the circumvention, but nonetheless,

20

Wyoming argues that they violate the apportionment.

21

Now it is that the United States

Nebraska in 19 -- throughout this case and part

22

of the 1993 decision, ruled that -- or argued that Wyoming

23

violated the apportionment by constructing projects on

24

tributaries in Wyoming.

25

no restrictions on those tributaries, but yes, Nebraska,

The Court ruled indeed there are

1

you can come forward and seek to modify the decree and to

2

add those restrictions.
The Court has now similarly found that there are

3
4

no limits on Nebraska's diversions,

5

position that the Court has not rejected the possibility

6

that Wyoming could seek to have those restrictions added,

7

that definition of -QUESTION:

8

9

but it's Wyoming's

Well, you know, I'm a little confused

because I thought that in Wyoming's requested amended

10

counterclaim and first cross-claim that Wyoming was

11

seeking to alter the 75 percent-25 percent apportionment

12

approach.

13

MR. COOK:

That's not correct, Your Honor.

14

QUESTION:

That is not correct?

15

MR. COOK:

That is not Wyoming's purpose.

16

Wyoming's purpose is to stop the circumvention of the

17

decree.

18

QUESTION:

Did the master seem to think that

19

that is what the first amended counterclaim and cross­

20

claim was seeking to do?

21

MR. COOK:

I believe that's correct.

I believe

22

he focused on the type of amendment that the Court might

23

enter, how it would amend the 1945 decree, rather than the

24

question of whether it should be amended, and where

25

Wyoming is at at this point is the request to go to trial

to seek the need to amend the decree.
QUESTION:

Well, Wyoming does want to seek an

3

amendment, and wants to change the 75-25 percent

4

apportionment?

5

MR. COOK:

No.

6

QUESTION:

No?

7

QUESTION:

Well, what would the amendment be?

8

9
10
11

Well then -I

mean -- I'm sorry.
QUESTION:

That's my question.

If you answer

no, what kind of an amendment do you want?
MR. COOK:

Your Honor, we would add to the 75-

12

25 apportionment further definition of Nebraska's water

13

right, and what -- and the reason I say that, the basis

14

for the Court granting jurisdiction over the circumvention

15

claim as you've announced --

16

QUESTION:

Well, by virtue of imposing some

17

quantitative limitation?

18

quantitative limitation?

Is that what you're seeking, a

19

MR. COOK:

That's very likely, Your Honor.

20

QUESTION:

Well, then that is different than the

21

approach taken under the decree of the percentage

22

appointment, so the master may be right.

23

MR. COOK:

It is an addition to that approach,

24

but let me explain why it's appropriate for the Court to

25

consider that, and it's appropriate because in 1945 the

1

United States brought the proposition to the Court that

2

without a further definition in terms of quantity

3

instantaneous diversion rates imposed on Nebraska's

4

apportionment, that they would indeed circumvent the

5

decree, or the apportionment.

6

The Court said, we won't speculate that Nebraska

7

will do that, and we see no need to go beyond the 75-25

8

split of the natural flow at this point in time, but if

9

that case develops, you may come back to the Court and ask

10

for those additional -- that additional definition on

11

Nebraska's apportionment.

12

And that's the basic foundation, the unanswered

13

question, or the reserved question the Court had agreed

14

early on in 1987 to accept and allow Wyoming to pursue in

15

its counterclaim, and our first counterclaim, amended

16

counterclaim, is virtually the same counterclaim we

17

brought to you in 1987, Your Honor.

18

QUESTION:

Do I understand you correctly that

19

one possible amendment that might satisfy you would be an

20

amendment so the decree would read something like this:

21

Nebraska is entitled to X percent up to so many

22

acre feet, so that there would be an acre feet limitation

23

which in fact would be, I suppose, a limitation on the

24

percentage.

25

that if there were excess usable water, that Wyoming in

That would then give Wyoming the advantage

1

effect would be able to either keep it or more easily

2

claim it, so long as Nebraska got its so many acre feet.

3

Is that what it would boil down to?

4

MR. COOK:

I think that's a clear

5

characterization of where this case could end up, Your

6

Honor.

7

QUESTION:

But that, as Justice O'Connor says,

8

whether it should be entertained or not, that would be a

9

reconceptualization of the decree.

10

MR. COOK:

That's correct, Your Honor, and let

11

me suggest to the Court that as we've said in our briefs

12

and throughout this amended pleadings phase that there's

3

something different between the decree and the

4

apportionment.

5

The apportionment is to protect lands and the

6

irrigation of lands that received water from that critical

7

reach of the river.

8

Diversion Dam.

9

The apportionment ends at Tri-State

The decree is merely a tool to implement that

20

apportionment, and Nebraska -- and the Court has accepted

21

and we recognize that we will go to trial for Nebraska to

22

try to amend, to add injunctions against Wyoming to change

23

that decree to give full effect to its apportionment, to

24

bring a quantity -- to ensure that a quantity of water

25

becomes available in that critical reach.

QUESTION:

1

Other than this dispute that we've

2

discussed over quantity and percentages, does the first

3

exception also involve a dispute as to the waters that are

4

subject to the reapportionment, or is that not part of the

5

disagreement here?
MR. COOK:

6

7

disagreement on the first counterclaim.
QUESTION:

8

9
10

In other words, what we're concerned

with is the pivotal reach area, and there's no question
but that the canals are part of that?
MR. COOK:

11
12

I don't believe that's part of the

That's correct.

The point that we

make is that the Court has passed on this question.

There

3

has been no change since

4

this claim, and there's no reason to reverse the Court's

5

decision.

6

987, when you agreed to accept

Quite frankly, in
QUESTION:

I'm still slightly mixed up.

As I

7

read the amendment, your first counterclaim seems to mix

up two things.

What you seem to ask for is, we'd like a
no

more than what they need for beneficial use --

21

MR. COOK:

Correct.

22

QUESTION:

-- not a percentage limitation.

But

23

then it says, the reason that we want that is because to

24

do the contrary would be in excess of the volumetric

25

limitations or diversion limitations that are fixed in

L

paragraph IV of the decree, so that sounds as if what

2

you're saying, the decree requires that.
And that I think is what might have explained

3
4

the master saying, look, you brought this action to

5

enforce the decree, not to modify the decree.

5

to go bring a different action and say some other rule

7

requires us, not the decree, but we want a new decree or

3

something, and we want to now decide they're only going to

9

get so many acre feet, or whatever it is, then go do that,

If you want

10

but this is quite mixed up and contrary to the way you

11

started out, and contrary to what the Court said, where it

12

said the decree, this Court said is a percentage

B

allocation, not an absolute allocation.
Am I right in thinking that's how the master's

14
15

thinking?

16

MR. COOK:

He very well could be thinking that.

17

QUESTION:

Well then, what's wrong with that

MR. COOK:

The what's wrong is that Wyoming has

08
19

thinking?

20

always sought injunctions to prevent the future

21

circumvention, the continued circumvention of the decree.

22

Wyoming always posed the thought that there would be

23

something new added to the decree to accomplish its

24

purpose, so we've not -- we use the word "modify" now

25

because the word "modify" was clearly expressed in the

Court's

Pardon me?

QUESTION:

Maybe this would get at the -- why

4

didn't you make your first amended complaint the

following:

decree has nothing to do with any absolute limitation in

7

volume, we now make a new complaint, and this is our

8

complaint.

amount of money they can take -- the amount of water they

10

can take to an absolute limit of X million, or beneficial

11

use.

12

conceding for the sake of argument that the

Our complaint is, we want you to limit the

Why didn't you write it that way?
MR. COOK:

I don't know.

We clearly had that in

3

mind, Your Honor, but we don't want to presume what the

4

remedy would be, necessarily, at the beginning.

5

Let me suggest, thought, that one of the real -

6

- another problem is that the Court has, or the special

7

master recommends a decision on the merits of this claim

8

after there's been clearly an understanding that even

9

peripheral issues surrounding Wyoming's counterclaims

20

require factual development to get at, and neither of the

21

parties sought summary judgment in the prior proceedings,

22

because there are questions of material fact in dispute

23

about Wyoming's counterclaims, therefore, we're caught up

24

in a situation where we will now be -- lose forever the

25

opportunity to bring a circumvention claim if you adopt

1

2

the special master's recommendation.
QUESTION:

Mr. Cook, do I understand correctly

3

that the circumvention claim is not entirely out of the

4

case as the special master sees it?

5

although he was disallowing the counterclaim, that you

6

could make defensive use of that matter?

7

MR. COOK:

Right.

Didn't he say,

He suggests that we can bring

8

it -- we can defend against Nebraska's claims with

9

essentially the same proof, and our point is that if the

10

case is going to have that evidence, or that type of

11

evidence in front of it, and the Court will have that kind

12

of evidence in front of it anyway, what is to be gained by

13

limiting the remedies that would be available to Wyoming

14

using that same proof, or that same type proof.

15

Further, I've never been fond of structuring my

16

case in a responsive manner when it would rely on certain

17

claims being brought by Nebraska to defend against.

18

would prevent me from maybe getting the full picture on

19

defense from the Court.

20

QUESTION:

That

I'm interested in Wyoming's fourth

21

cross-claim which the master had recommended allowing to

22

be made, but the United States and Nebraska oppose that,

23

and would you mind addressing that a little bit?

24
25

The fourth cross-claim includes an allegation
that the United States has not operated its upstream

1

reservoirs in accordance with various private contracts

2

that exist for their operation.

3

MR. COOK:

Wyoming's --

4

QUESTION:

And why should that claim be included

5

in this dispute?
MR. COOK:

6

Because the United States has brought

7

the operation of its Federal storage facilities and its

8

ability to deliver water under its contracts into this

9

case when it argued that Deer Creek should not be built

10

because it would in fact impact that operation.
QUESTION:

11
12

Well, is Wyoming a party to any of

those contracts?
MR. COOK:

13

No, Wyoming isn't a party, and that's

14

why this case, there is a private suit going on, but

15

that's why this case and this Court is a more appropriate

16

forum, because the State parties and equitable

17

apportionment underlies or is involved in this whole

18

matter of interpretation of Federal contracts and Federal

19

law.

20

QUESTION:

But at this point, the master thought

21

there was no evidence of -- that Wyoming was getting less

22

of the natural flows than it otherwise would, so the

master didn't see -- doesn't demonstrate, at least, any

24

need for the fourth cross-claim.

proposition on the fourth cross-claim.
QUESTION:

2

Well, I know he thought it should be

3

allowed, but he also noted that at this juncture there's

4

no evidence.

5
6

MR. COOK:

Well, there's no evidence at all in

this case, Your Honor.

7

QUESTION:

I presume Wyoming would plan to

8

introduce some evidence if it's allowed to proceed on that

9

counterclaim.
MR. COOK:

10

In fact we have -- in the process of

11

summary judgment proceedings have affidavits that indicate

12

the type of injury Wyoming will produce.

QUESTION:

Could you just give me a quick

summary of that?

National Government is doing?

MR. COOK:

I think I can sum up our proposition on that as

that the United States cannot make the distribution of

suggest those issues are more perfectly decided somewhere

else.

MR. TYMKOVICH:

Exception 2, Your Honor.

Of which -Of Wyoming.

Exception 2 of Wyoming.

Thank you.

Twice before, this Court has

10

been asked by Nebraska to expand the scope of proceedings

11

to include nonirrigation season flows.

12

Nebraska asked for a general global apportionment of the

13

water resource to include downstream flows far beyond the

14

scope of the 1945 decree.

15

request.

16

First, in 1988

In 1988, the Court denied that

Again, in 1992, Nebraska once again sought to

17

expand the scope of the proceeding to include those

18

claims.

19

those issues should not be a part of the case.

20

In the 1993 ruling, the Court again agreed that

The special master, the United States, Colorado

21

and Wyoming, all who have looked at those issues, have

22

concluded that those issues are not ripe for adjudication

23

in these proceedings, and we would like the Court today in

24

this ruling to affirm that those issues should not be

25

heard as we go to trial in the case.

The United States agreed with that in their

Furthermore, many of these issues are being

11

resolved or addressed in other forums, and would not be

12

appropriate for consideration in this original proceeding.

13

QUESTION:

Is it your concern that the evidence

14

on wildlife as it affects the irrigation season flows just

15

expands the litigation in the same way that the special

16

master disclaims when he refuses to allow the evidence for

17

all other purposes?

18

MR. TYMKOVICH:

That's correct.

We think the

19

special master closed the front door on the claim,

20

apparently, by denying the Count IV expansion.

21

the back door he's let in all the evidence and all the

22

consideration of that claim in the proceedings anyway, so

23

what he's taken away on the one hand he's given back to

24

the parties on the other.

1

to be the assumption that the seasonal flows that you're

2

concerned with are requisite for irrigation uses only.

3

That's not what the compact says, is it?

4

MR. TYMKOVICH:

Those uses were not evaluated

5

under the 1945 decree, and what the Court's 1993 opinion,

6

what the proceedings to date indicate is, how do you

7

analyze the supply issues, the new development upstream in

8

Wyoming and what their impact is on the pivotal reach of

9

the North Platte River?

Those are the issues in the case,

10

and the Court has never opened the door for consideration

11

of downstream new uses, new demands, as it affects this

12

case, so that would be a remarkable expansion of the

13

proceedings, to permit that aspect of the case.

14

QUESTION:

Why do you say it would let in all

There's been a suggestion by the

20

United States in their briefs that a limited inquiry would

21

be not improper in this case, and the special master in

22

his report says limited inquiry would be appropriate.

think, however, that an evaluation of the effect on

24

wildlife usage and nonirrigation season flows would open

this proceeding to a very expanded and complex evaluation

it would let in all the evidence that was -- that would

have been kept out under the earlier part of the decree

saying we don't get into the nonirrigation season.

6

does it let in all of the evidence?

7

MR. TYMKOVICH:

Why

Because if the Court goes --

8

permits the case to proceed with an evaluation of effects

9

several hundred miles to the East of the pivotal reach,

10

then you're also going to have to evaluate the effect of

11

Nebraska's conservation and waste practices and many other

12

issues that were specifically excluded previously in the

13

case, so in that way you get to many issues that were --

where the Court --

QUESTION:

Well, many, but not all, I suppose.

16

MR. TYMKOVICH:

I think it really is the

17

question of ripeness and the scope of the proceedings,

18

because it would be a very expanded proceeding.

19

everybody would concede that this case would be far

20

different than it is if the Court were to grant that

21

exception and limit the scope of the proceedings.

QUESTION:

How could we say in advance that the

gone down from about 70 percent or something to under 10,

2

20 percent of what it was, that there are wildlife

3

endangered if you don't -- you have to have some water in

4

there, and whatever water they'd have in the winter may

5

mean there's less in the summer.

6

I mean, it's not difficult to think of

7

relationships.

8

if it turns out to be relevant, I'll let it in?

9

How can we say that he's wrong in saying

MR. TYMKOVICH:

I think there is a matter of

10

relationships, but that's not this case, and the special

11

master himself, in the third interim report and in the

12

oral argument last summer, indicated that those claims

13

were not ripe for these proceedings.

14

that they won't be in the future.

15

QUESTION:

That's not to say

I might not understand it.

I thought

16

he was saying, we're not going to have a special complaint

17

based on wildlife, but if it turns out that this evidence

18

of wildlife harm is relevant to what we're doing, I'm

19

going to let it in.

20

MR. TYMKOVICH:

I don't think there's a

21

functional distinction between permitting the trial of

22

those issues in this proceeding as opposed to granting or

23

denying Count IV of the claim, which specifically

24

addresses it.

There will be no difference in the trial in

QUESTION:

1

Well, I take it he wants to be

2

confident that his judgment is neither too narrow nor too

3

broad, so he wants to have this evidence to inform him as

4

to the effect of the ruling that he's asked to enter.
MR. TYMKOVICH:

5

Again, that goes to the scope of

6

the proceedings and whether these claims are now ripe for

7

consideration, even regardless of their relevancy to the

8

proceeding, because the special master has acknowledged

9

that those issues cannot bear on the injury in this case.
QUESTION:

10

Yes, but what I was thinking, it's

11

just like a trial judge normally.

says, let's -- he's says, I don't know.

I think Your Honor is suggesting

20

that it's the equivalent of a motion in limine, and it

21

really goes far beyond that, because really it makes the

difference of whether or no Colorado is in this case at

23

at the entire basin-wide effects of wildlife and

endangered species issues.

It would really be an about-face on the Court's

prudential matter these issues are not justiciable or not

ripe at this time.

19

they've not filed an exception to the special master's

failure to grant their Count IV, and I think the reason

that Nebraska has done that is that they feel they can try

these issues in the back-door manner in which the special

The endangered species and wildlife issues are

2

currently a part of at least three proceedings, one

3

involving Endangered Species Act interpretations on the

4

Deer Creek and the Grayrocks Reservoirs, the issues are

5

also in the FERC proceedings involving Lake McConaughy,

6

and the three States have involved in a mutual cooperative

7

approach through their Governor's office to try to

8

accommodate and resolve the wildlife issues.

So importantly, I think this case ought to defer

to those agencies and defer to that process to let it take

11

its course, rather than fix in stone or enshrine in a

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Mr. Justice Breyer, I want to go back to a

10
11

question you asked of Mr. Cook.

12

something like, why didn't you just come to the Court on

13

the theory that conditions had changed rather radically

14

since 1945 and ask the Court to do what we think you're

15

doing now, and that is, changing the apportionment

16

formula?

17

You asked, I believe,

The answer to that question, and it's an answer

18

that I think Wyoming is fully aware of, the answer to that

19

question is, had they done that, the Court would have had

20

to start essentially with a tabula rasa.

21

that you would start all over with today's equities in all

22

of their forums, and redo the entire case.

geographical scope of this case is a conceptually

2

ineffective way of addressing the proposed amendments, and

3

second I would like to explain that Wyoming is attempting

4

to convert the percentage apportionment into a mass

5

allocation based on beneficial use limitations, an

6

argument made by Wyoming and rejected in 1945.

7

In that regard, I would also like to explain why

8

the Court should not upend long-settled expectations that

9

have become an intrinsic part of the apportionment since

1945 .
The first point I want to make goes to Wyoming's

second exception.

understanding that he must evaluate all of the interests

14

in Nebraska against which the threat of injury would be

posed by new development in Wyoming.

That is, to Master Olpin's

Wyoming and Colorado's argument in this regard

17

is that you should not look at any uses below Tri-State

Dam or outside the irrigation season.

19

Wyoming and Colorado are asking you not to take cognizance

20

of admittedly existing interests outside the irrigation

21

season or below Tri-State Dam that would or could be

22

affected by the intended development.

Accordingly,

The Court addressed this issue in 1993, and I

the same time, however, the Court provided Nebraska with

the opportunity to establish new development on Deer Creek

and on the Laramie River so that those equities can be

balanced against the threat of injury from new development

in Wyoming.

7

At

Special Master Olpin has stated that he must

8

balance all of the relevant equities.

Wyoming is simply

9

seeking to limit Nebraska's equities.

In order to reach

10

an equitable balance, we believe that the Court must

11

juxtapose all of the equitable interests today in order to

12

adjust the decree to meet present day conditions --

QUESTION:

Well, how do you see this line that

the master proposes?

claim outright some right to protect the wildlife uses,

in under the proposed amendments, and just how do you see

that working?

MR. SIMMS:

He wouldn't allow Nebraska to just

I think you'd have to look at it not

20

as a change in the scope of the case, as Wyoming would

21

like you to see it, but as having everything to do with

the scope of the potential injury.

23

What Mr. Olpin has done is to look at discrete

proposed individual developments in Wyoming, think that

Well, it's quite vague, and I still

don't understand what would come in, as opposed to what

would be admitted if your State were allowed to amend the

MR. SIMMS:

the one hand, which could be like this, and the scope of

MR. SIMMS:

Okay.

The fourth cross-claim goes

14

to the storage side of the issue.

15

matter was addressed, everybody was fully aware when

16

Wyoming argued that you should place beneficial use

17

limitations on Wyoming, that you had to apportion storage

18

water and natural flow at the same time.

19

Back in 1945 when the

In this regard, Wyoming made a statement in its

20

response brief at page 19 -- let me quote it real quickly.

21

"No one asserted in 1945, as Wyoming does now, a need for

22

the Court affirmatively to require the Bureau's compliance

23

with Federal law.

24

issue that Wyoming's fourth cross-claim would bring was

25

not before the Court in 1945."

Such compliance was assumed.

(800) FOR DEPO

Thus, the

Well, in 1945, that statement was most certainly

1

2

not true.

What Wyoming did in 1945 was to assert that

3

storage water in section 8 of the Reclamation Act as well

4

as the related Federal and State law had to be brought

5

before the Court's attention and had to actually be placed

6

in the decree, in special provisions in the decree to make

7

the decree enforceable as against the storage water

8

contracts and the storage water deliveries.
Wyoming's view at the time was, if those

9
10

provisions were not placed in the decree, that the only

11

redress would be found in Federal district court.

12

is, the contracts would be enforced as it was assumed that

13

they would be enforced, but that could be done only among

14

the proper parties and in the proper forum.

That

We do believe that there is an inconsistency

15
16

between the master's recommendation with respect to the

17

first counterclaim on the one hand and the fourth cross­

18

claim on the other, but I think an analysis of what he did

19

and a close evaluation of the briefs would lend itself

20

more to our view than his on that matter.
The second point I would like to make is that

21

22

the Court rejected the theory of beneficial use

23

MR. SIMMS:

Wyoming -Yes.
Thank you.
The Court found that you had to have

10

some formula that was responsive to changes in supply.

11

The second reason the Court did not adopt the beneficial

12

use limitations is that the Court knew that storage was

13

essential to doing any kind of mass allocation based on

14

beneficial use.

15

Third, the Court did not adopt the beneficial

16

use theory because that would have required placing

17

limitations on individual irrigation districts and private

18

canals that were not in the case, and the Court simply

19

doesn't do that kind of stuff in parens patriae actions.

20

Those three conditions have not changed.

The

21

river still fluctuates wildly, you would still have to

22

apportion both storage water and natural flow, and you

23

don't define private rights in parens patriae cases.

alleges that the United States has failed to operate

We believe that it would be

First, this Court's 1945 decree does not govern

11

Wyoming's claim.

Paragraph VI and XII(b) of the North

Platte Decree explicitly state that the decree shall not

affect storage water or in any way interfere with the

14

Federal Government's operation of water storage

facilities.

16

The Court included those paragraphs in

17

recognition that the Federal reclamation projects predated

18

the 1945 apportionment, that private parties had

19

contracted for storage water from those projects, and

20

their rights in the operation of the projects were fixed

21

by the contracts.

22

Simply put, the decree at issue in this

proceeding does not address the distribution of storage

water because the contracts between the Bureau and the

individual water users govern who receives that water.

2

Wyoming's pleading itself, and it is framed completely in

terms of the allocation of storage water.

Paragraph 31 at E-ll says the United States has

with applicable Federal and State laws, and has failed to

abide by the contracts governing the use of storage water.

8

Specifically, the United States has allocated storage

water in a manner, et cetera.

But the fact of the matter is that they're

challenging how we can allocate storage water, and the

ensures that the natural flow portion of the river is

only allocated thereafter, and this is all primarily an

satisfied first when we do the water accounting, and the

is that the contract water itself is already allocated in

It has been distributed by virtue of the

MR. COOK:

Thank you, Mr. Minear.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

Last things first.

Issues in the GID case

14

versus the issue in our fourth cross-claim, our fourth

15

cross-claim is much broader.

16

operation of the storage facilities was a predicate of the

17

75-25 apportionment, as Justice Breyer has noted, and

Court has continued to recognize, and I say that because
