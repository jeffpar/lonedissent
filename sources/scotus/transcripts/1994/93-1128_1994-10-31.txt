ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD C. DuMONT

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. DuMONT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case involves 38 U.S. Code section 1151,

12

which provides so-called service-connected disability

13

benefits to veterans who have suffered an injury not, in

14

fact, as a result of their military service but as the

15

result of hospitalization or medical care provided by the

16

Veterans Administration.

17

During the statute's 70-year history of

18

enactment, implementation, repeal, reenactment,

19

recodification, and periodic amendment, the VA has

20

consistently held that section 1151 does not authorize the

21

extension of benefits for disabilities arising as a

22

reasonably foreseeable consequence of properly rendered

23

medical care.

24
25

Rather --

QUESTION:

During most of that period there was

no opportunity for judicial review of that judgment, is

that right?
MR. DuMONT:

2

That's correct, Justice Scalia.

3

However, we would point out that in addition to that fact,

4

or precisely because of that fact, it's well-known that

5

the Veterans Committees of Congress have always taken a

6

very active interest in the administration of Veterans

7

Affairs.
QUESTION:

8

9

Well, that would presumably mean that

what was being done pleased the then-current committees of

10

Congress.

11

statute when originally enacted, by perhaps quite

12

different people, meant.

13

It would have very little to do with what the

MR. DuMONT:

Well, although we think there is

14

quite a remarkable record of consistency in that regard,

15

since there was a good deal of administration in the

16

twenties, shortly after the enactment, there was a good

17

deal of administration in the thirties, after the

18

reenactment, and there has been a great deal of ongoing

19

administration during the subsequent period -- so we

20

believe really that the evidence that Congress has over

21

all of those years expressed no dissatisfaction, in fact

22

no one in Congress, no one else, to our knowledge, has

23

expressed any great dissatisfaction with the core

24

interpretation of section 1151 not to provide benefits for

25

the ordinary, foreseeable results of proper medical

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

Would you expect the Veterans

7

Committee of Congress to object to the VA giving away too

8

many benefits?

9

MR. DuMONT:

We would expect the veterans and

10

the committee to object if they thought that the Veterans

11

Administration was applying too narrow a construction of

12

the statute, which is the claim that the respondent makes

13

in this case.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

Well, we would expect them to object,

maybe, if there was a good reason for them to do so.
One thing I don't know, maybe it's in the briefs

17

but I just couldn't get a sense of it, is, what was the

18

percentage of these claims in which the Government's

19

policy faould make a difference, because as I understand

20

it, if there were treatment for, later treatment for a

21

service-connected disability, there was no fault

22

requirement at all, so that the only cases in which the

23

Government's policy, if I understand it correctly, would

24

make a difference, are those in which there was no prior

25

service-connected disability, and the veteran simply went

1

in because he was sick or he was hurt or what-not.
Was the percentage of these cases sufficiently

2

3

high so that anyone would have paid much attention to

4

them?

5

difference did the policy make?

6

MR. DuMONT:

Did -- in other words, I'm saying what practical

I think it makes quite a

7

significant practical difference, actually.

8

of the figures from the very early period.

9

can tell you that a very substantial proportion of the

10

care rendered by the VA, both hospitalization and outÂ­

11

patient medical care, is rendered to veterans whose

12

disability is nonservice-connected, or whose condition is

13

a nonservice-connected condition, and therefore --

QUESTION:

I'm not aware
However, now I

But in the early years we just don't

know.

16

amendment, we don't know what the substantiality of this

17

effect would have been in that period.

18

Prior, for example, to the, what was it, the '34

MR. DuMONT:

That's correct.

I'm not aware

19

of -- wfell, of course, until 1924, by and large veterans

20

with nonservice-connected disabilities were not entitled

21

to care at all, which is one of the reasons that we think

22

it's implausible to accept respondent's contention that

23

section 1151 in its original incarnation was intended to

24

somehow put nonservice-connected veterans on a par with

25

service-connected veterans, because really they were quite

separate questions.

2

QUESTION:

Mr. DuMont, do we know on the

3

question of numbers,

4

most,

5

in showing fault or accident?

6

did this policy screen out?

7

obviously.

8
9

of the unrepresented claimants,

and

if not all, of these were, what percentage prevailed
How many of these claimants
This case was screened out,

What struck me is,

I don't know of another

compensation system where an unrepresented party is

10

required to prove fault.

11

compensation scheme decided,

12

administrator where there is no representation for the

13

claimant and yet the claimant has the burden of showing

14

fault -- that seems to be unique.

15

MR. DuMONT:

If you know of another
in the first instance, by an

I'm not aware of another system

16

that has this structure, but I think the entire system of

17

veterans' benefits is unique, but part of what's unique

18

about it is that it is meant to be nonadversarial at the

19

initial' stages, and I think there is really no evidence --

20

despite the allegations from respondent,

21

evidence that the claims adjudicators at the VA don't do a

22

proper job of trying to develop the facts of these cases

23

when they're presented and try to figure out whether there

24

was fault on the part of the VA,

25

within the meaning of the statute.

there's no

or some fault that comes

QUESTION:

1

But the burden is supposed to be on

2

the claimant, the unrepresented claimant, to prove the

3

fault.

4

MR. DuMONT:

Well, that's not -- not really

5

true.

At the administrative stage, by statute all factual

6

questions are to be resolved in favor of the claimant, and

7

it's not really a question of who has the burden.
The claimant is supposed to come to the Veterans

8

9

Administration, and the Veterans Administration has an

10

obligation to help the claimant develop the facts of that

11

claim, so it's really an objective investigation process

12

which the VA people are perfectly capable of implementing,

13

and there's no evidence they're not implementing it

14

correctly.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

But the claimant loses unless fault

is shown.
MR. DuMONT:

The plaintiff cannot -- the

18

claimant cannot require -- recover benefits unless there

19

is some' showing of fault or an accident within the meaning

20

of the regulations, that's correct.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. DuMONT:

23
24
25

Who must make that showing?
It must be -- it must be made on

behalf of the claimant, that's correct, but -QUESTION:

Mr. DuMont, may I ask you, if we

agree with the court below that the statute just doesn't

2

such as, well, what about the removal of a lung, and that

3

results in shortness of breath, should that be covered by

4

the statute.

5

requirement, and is it conceivable that some of the

6

examples you gave would just not be injuries within the

7

meaning of the statute?

Does the statute still contain an injury

8

MR. DuMONT:

9

QUESTION:

10

I certainly think that that's -Quite apart from any negligence

requirement.
MR. DuMONT:

11

I certainly think that that is

12

conceivable.

13

that the term "injury" as used in this particular statute

14

has room for interpretation, and that what Congress was

15

thinking about when they passed this statute was not the

16

ordinary, foreseeable result of proper medical care, which

17

is all we are talking about here.

18

We think that, as we've said in our brief,

Remember, the respondent came to the VA with a

19

herniatfed disk that had nothing to do with his military

20

service.

21

There's no contention that the care was improper, and he

22

experienced, apparently, a common and foreseeable result

23

of that surgery, which is some weakness of dorsiflexion in

24

the left foot.

25

He received a perfectly proper operation.

Now, the question is, when Congress passed this

1

whole scheme, as they've watched it be administered over

2

the years, did they really intend to extend not only the

3

benefit of free care to an indigent veteran, which is what

4

happened here, for a nonservice-connected disability, but

5

also a lifetime of disability compensation benefits for a

6

perfectly foreseeable result of the proper care he

7

received?

8

9

QUESTION:

Well, that's why I'm asking the

question, because it seems to me that quite apart from any

10

requirement of finding negligence on the part of the

11

hospital, there may be other requirements in the statute

12

to be met for coverage.

13

MR. DuMONT:

Well, we think that's quite right.

14

The veteran has to suffer an injury, and we don't think --

15

we think it's perfectly acceptable for the Veterans

16

Administration to say that within the context of this

17

statute you do not suffer an injury when you get the care

18

that you were entitled to, it was proper care, and all

19

that happens is that you have some common, foreseeable

20

side effect of that care.

21

QUESTION:

But that's a separate issue.

I mean,

22

you can come to that conclusion and still say that when

23

recovery is required, it is a nonfault-based system.

24

MR. DuMONT:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.
You're saying, if -- the Government's

1

case, if I understand it, is there is no recovery even if

2

it is not a common, foreseeable consequence of the

3

operation, but if there is some flukish consequence of the

4

operation you would say there's no recovery unless it's a

5

result of negligence, right, whereas the question that

6

Justice O'Connor puts is a question where it is the

7

foreseeable and normal consequence of the operation.

8

9
10

MR. DuMONT:

And that, of course, is the normal

case and the case we have here, but -QUESTION:

Well, but that's not the argument

11

you're making.

12

plaintiff cannot recover because this was the normal

13

consequence and, therefore, when the operation was decided

14

upon you expected to have this and, therefore, you

15

suffered no injury.

16

if you didn't expect this, even if it was unforeseeable,

17

it's not an injury because there was no negligence.

18

That's a quite different argument, isn't it?

19

You are not making the argument that this

You're making the argument that even

MR. DuMONT:

The argument we're making, Justice

20

Scalia, is this:

21

me back up, if I may for a minute, to 1924, and what was

22

the situation in 1924.

23

the statute was intended to cover -- let

Since 1917, the VA had provided hospitalization

24

and medical care benefits for veterans with service-

25

connected disabilities, and that left a gap, a perceived
11

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260

1

gap in the coverage of the statute.
The VA felt that its authority to compensate for

2

3

the foreseeable result of the injury would cover the

4

normal results of medical care, but it did not feel that

5

it would cover something where an intervening cause had

6

come along in the form of malpractice by a VA physician or

7

some particularly unforeseeable thing that happened while

8

the veteran was under VA care, and it was for that reason

9

that it proposed the statute in 1924.
That's -- if you look at the legislative

10
11

materials, what they are talking about is, Congress, we

12

have to fix this statute because there are a limited

13

number of cases where we have a veteran who comes in and

14

there's no current statutory authority to compensate for

15

cases of malpractice or error in judgment and so on.

16

they therefore passed section 213, which is now section

17

1151.

18

Now,

Now, we know that that was not intended to

19

address' the question of nonservice-connected veterans

20

because there was no treatment for nonservice-connected

21

veterans, with limited exceptions, for that, and we know

22

that it could not have been intended exclusively to

23

address the cases of examinations, where somebody might be

24

examined, be injured, and then be found not to have a

25

service-connected condition.

That was a set of cases.

1

But Congress didn't focus exclusively on that, because in

2

fact they had to amend the statute in

3

cases.

4

925 to cover those

So what we're left with, as a matter of

5

detection, is saying, what was Congress getting at?

6

they were getting at is these cases of service-connected

7

veterans who were injured under care of the VA in some way

8

that was not considered to be a proximate cause of their

9

service-connected injury, and that was either for one --

What

10

it was for one of two reasons, either because there was

11

intervening negligence on the part of some VA agent, or

12

because something simply freakish happened, something that

3

was completely unforeseeable.

4
5

What it was never intended to cover is the
ordinary results of care.

6

QUESTION:

Isn't it possible to interpret that

7

legislative history that you describe as reflecting an

8

intent to have the period when the service-connected

9

disability of a veteran is being treated in hospital as

20

though it were treatment while he was in service, and

21

therefore whatever happened as a result of that would be

22

sort of the equivalent to a service-connected disability

23

itself?

24
25

MR. DuMONT:

Well, we don't think so, and we

don't think so because the question is, what would

1

Congress have intended when it was extending these

2

benefits, and it's perfectly plausible that they intended

3

to cover a veteran for anything that happened as a result

4

of Government fault.

5

QUESTION:

But to give a specific example of the

6

doctor does the best he can and without neglect, a General

7

Hines -- that's quoted in the court of appeals opinion.

MR. DuMONT:

That's correct.

from the legislative history is inconsistent with our

view,

legislative history as a --

That statement

and I think we have to say that,

QUESTION:

reading the

It is consistent with the view that

13

they wanted to more or less treat the period when the

14

former serviceman is in the hospital as though that was

military service,

be just as though he had been wounded on the battlefield

17

or something like that.

18

so that any consequences of that would

MR. DuMONT:

One could take that view, but I

19

suggest' that by reading the entire legislative history and

20

thinking about what Congress would have had in mind,

21

would be an unlikely conclusion to reach, because it is

22

simply not plausible that Congress, when they were

23

extending benefits in 1924,

24

doing was saying, not only are we going to -- well,

25

remember that they were thinking about service-connected

about nonservice-connected veterans.

3

But in

There was a separate issue

924 they thought, we will liberalize the

4

system.

5

veterans on a relatively general basis, but it's not very

6

plausible to me that they thought what they were doing

7

when they extended that limited hospitalization benefit

8

was to say we will pick up the tab for the original care

9

for your nonservice-connected condition plus a lifetime

We will extend care to nonservice-connected

10

disability bill for anything that happens that really is a

11

result not of your care but of that condition.
QUESTION:

12

Mr. DuMont, why do you divide it into

3

two categories?

4

they had in mind, one is negligence and the other is

5

unanticipated consequences.

6

consequences alone cover negligence as well?

You say that there are two things that

Wouldn't unanticipated

7

I mean, couldn't it simply be a regime in which

8

the normal consequences of this operation are expected to

9

be borne?

They are not an injury, but if they are

20

unanticipated, whether because the doctor was negligent,

21

and surely that's not anticipated, or for any other

22

reason, they are covered.

thing?

24
25

Doesn't that come to the same

I have a lot of trouble reading in a negligence
requirement.

There's just no language in this statute

1

that smells of negligence.
MR. DuMONT:

2

Well, let me focus on that.

We

3

think the language that's key here as to that point is the

4

language, as a result of, and that language -- respondent

5

would have the Court interpret that language as plain on

6

its face, to mean nothing more than factual causation, but

7

I think that's not only inconsistent with some of this

8

Court's precedents in the antitrust area, which we cited

9

in our reply brief, Halmers v. SIPC being the obvious

10

example.
But it's inconsistent with common sense.

11

12

I

mean, when you have a statute where you --

13

QUESTION:

There's a further textual element

14

that you're leaving out, and that is, there's a provision

15

in there specifically referring to the fault of the

16

claimant, so that there is on the face of the text an

17

expression of consciousness of fault, but it was expressed

18

only with respect to the claimant.
MR. DuMONT:

19

That's true, but I think it, with

20

respect -- that it is of limited significance, because

21

that exclusion for fault of the claimant is one that runs

22

throughout the entire gamut of veterans' benefits

23

statutes.

What does that screen out?

Is that

1

misconduct on the part of the veteran?
MR. DuMONT:

It could be a variety of things.

3

It could be self-injury, it could be -- in many cases in

4

the early days, it was sexually transmitted diseases which

5

were considered misconduct diseases and were not covered.

6

suggestion there is any fault on the part of the Veterans

complications that may occur 10 percent of the time, 20

what --âwould it work to have a test which said, if it's

something bad that occurs more than half the time, okay,

that's part of the treatment, but if it occurs

sporadically, or less than half the time, approximately,

MR. DuMONT:

I think that might be a possible

2

line that the VA could have drawn in interpreting the

statute, because we think that the words,

of," give plenty of leeway for deciding what it was that

5

Congress was getting at.

6

"as a result

The fact is, the VA has drawn a somewhat

7

different line, a somewhat more conservative line, which

8

is to say, at the 5 or 10 percent level, if this is

9

something that if you open the textbook of medicine and

10

said, you're going to have this operation and here are the

11

possible side effects.

12

Or to look at it in another way, if this is

13

something you would be considered to have consented to as

14

a matter of informed consent when you underwent the

15

treatment in the first place, then that is not the kind of

16

thing that Congress meant to cover as a disability matter

17

under the statute.

18

So that's the line that VA has drawn.

We think

19

it's a Treasonable line, and we think it's entitled to

20

deference from the courts.

had drawn was one based on requirement of negligence on

posture of somebody -- of the question being, was there

2

fault or not fault, and that's most often thought of in

3

terms of negligence of care versus nonnegligence of care.

4

But it's in fact a little bit broader than that.

5

It's any kind of demonstrated fault or error in judgment

6

on the part of the people at the VA, or any kind of simply

7

freakish, unforeseeable accident that might occur, that

8

the Government is willing to accept responsibility for,

9

because after all you were under VA care when it happened,

10

and that seems to be a reasonable line, giving the benefit

11

of the doubt to the veteran.

12

QUESTION:

Can I be clear, though, it has to be

13

sufficiently freakish that it would not have normally been

14

covered in the textbooks and that sort of thing?

15

the fact that it's just 1 out of 100 cases would not be

16

enough to make it freakish.

17

MR. DuMONT:

I mean,

That's correct, and I think, you

18

know, one good example of that is the recent

19

reconsideration of the accident definition in the case of

20

blood transfusions in the early 1980's that might have

21

transmitted the HIV virus.

22

In those cases, it was determined that up to a

certain point it was really just not foreseeable to

anybody that was a way you could get HIV, and those,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH M. HANNON, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

9
10

Very well, Mr. DuMont.

MR. HANNON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Good morning.

11

I would like first to address a

12

number of points that were made by Mr. DuMont in his

13

argument before I proceed to my presentation.

14

First, there was a suggestion that because the

15

VA adjudicates compensation claims in a proper fashion and

16

there's no evidence that they do so in an improper

17

fashion, this scheme of fault or accident is permissible.

18

In Mr. Gardner's own case, the VA did not

19

adjudicate his compensation claim according to their own

20

standards.

21

Texas, with the assistance of VA personnel who actually

22

gave him the form to fill out initially, and the hearing

23

officer, who was a lay person, not trained in the law or

24

medicine, but someone whose job it is to attempt to apply

25

the statutes of Congress to compensation claims, denied

1

Mr. Gardner's claim based upon an outdated regulation.
The regulation that was utilized by the hearing

2

3

officer was one that was amended by the Veterans

4

Administration in 1978.

5

It was the most stringent regulation that the VA has ever

6

applied.

7
8

QUESTION:

It had existed from 1936 to 1978.

Mr. Hannon, how does this bear on the

question that's presented in the petition for certiorari?

9

MR. HANNON:

It bears on the question that's

10

presented because of the argument of the Veterans

11

Administration that the Court should defer to a so-called

12

longstanding method of interpreting the statute, and their

13

longstanding method of interpreting the statute wasn't

14

even applied accurately in Mr. Gardner's case.

15

There was a question of Justice Souter, I

16

believe, about the percentages of cases that we're really

17

talking about here, and that question was asked by Judge

18

Archer at the Federal circuit, and this Court doesn't

19

know, because the VA hasn't presented to the Court any

20

evidence, or to any court any evidence of what kinds of

21

cases we're talking about here, and the numbers of cases

22

we're talking about, other than the Harvard study, which

23

is completely speculative, as amicus Paralyzed Veterans

indicates.

The reason of the Department is

that it's an absurd result of a literal reading of the

that doesn't mean that the statute is ambiguous and

2

requires a fault-based or accident-based regulation -QUESTION:

3

You mean, there's no language in the

4

statute that would exclude that, but just, it's so absurd

5

you will ignore the language of the statute?

6

MR. HANNON:

QUESTION:

8

MR. HANNON:

9

QUESTION:

That's the Department's view.
No, is that your view?
It is not.

My view is --

What language in the statute excludes

10

the veteran suing for shortness of breath after he has

11

voluntarily agreed to have a lung removed?
MR. HANNON:

12

The language in the statute is that

3

language which requires that there be an additional

4

disability as a result of an injury which itself is the

5

result of hospital treatment.

6

QUESTION:

The VA - -

Well, this is an additional injury.

7

I mean, he didn't have shortness of breath before.

8

he does.
MR. HANNON:

9

Now,

Under the VA compensation system,

20

an additional disability is a disability which causes a

21

diminishment in the veteran's ability to earn a living.

That is the gist of the compensation scheme that runs

throughout the Veteran's Administration law.

Gangrene's okay.

as a result of diabetes I've developed an infection in my

What should be done here?

13

And the physicians at the VA Medical Hospital,

in conjunction, in consultation with the veteran, make a

decision, an informed decision, that they're going to

2

to die from poison, he doesn't have an additional

3

disability as contemplated by Congress in the compensation

4

scheme.

5

I would also suggest to the Court that the words

6

"as a result of the surgical treatment" also make it clear

7

that that is not a compensable condition.

8

the amputation of a leg did not occur as a result of

9

surgery or treatment in a direct causal sense, as the

It's because

10

Department would like the Court to apply, but as a matter

11

of an informed choice by the veteran with his physician to

12

contemplate the intended outcome of medical treatment.

13

That is, the amputation of the leg.

14
15
16

We all agree that this statute does not apply to
the intended outcomes of medical care and treatment.

1

But you would still have to prove the

2

negligence in order to prove, I suppose, that this was

3

something other than the usual informed consent case.

4

say the reason it's not an informed consent case is that

5

we got negligent advice.
MR. HANNON:

6

You

Justice Souter, we reject even the

7

informed consent analysis that is proposed by the

8

Department here, because that is not what the language of

9

Congress intends.
Informed consent -- in this case, in fact,

10
11

before the hearing officer in Texas, after Mr. Gardner

12

made his appeal, the hearing officer trotted out the

13

informed consent form that had been signed by Mr. Gardner.

14

Now, the terms of that informed consent form were as broad

15

as the attorneys of the Department and the physicians

16

could possibly make it.

17

seems to be that anything that is contained within an

18

informed consent form executed by a patient in a hospital

19

with VA' medical personnel is not covered under the

20

statute.

21

QUESTION:

The position of the Department

And what is your position?

Your

22

position is,

23

100 percent sure, if you have a gangrenous leg removed,

24

you will not have a leg, that's 100 percent sure.

The classic example that was set

forth by General Hines himself at the origin of this

statute in 1924 was a circumstance where a veteran goes

into a VA hospital to submit himself to a spinal tap for

19

the purposes of conducting a diagnostic test.

20

Both today and in 1924, there is a risk, a

21

hazard, in the very words of General Hines, that that

22

veteran may be paralyzed as a result of that spinal tap,

23

through absolutely no fault of medical personnel.

was an example that was not only cited by General Hines,

Mr. Gardner.

3

for them to suggest to Mr. Gardner that his spinal cord

type of surgery is simply inappropriate.

6

It is not.

QUESTION:

It is an adverse outcome, and

Mr. Hannon, would it be easier for

7

you, and perhaps for us, if we drew this distinction, the

8

distinction between the consequences, simply as a straight
matter of factual causation, of appropriate medical

10

procedures and, on the other hand, the imposition of

11

inappropriate medical procedures?

12

In your case, you're not claiming that it was

13

inappropriate to have disk surgery.

14

is that there was a consequence of the disk surgery, and

15

you should not be required to prove fault in order to

16

establish how that consequence occurred in the course of

17

what, in the abstract at least, was a perfectly

18

appropriate procedure, some disk surgery.

What you're claiming

look, the only case that I'm worried about here, and the

2

only case which perhaps the regs were intended to address,

3

is the case in which the procedure is appropriate, but

4

something goes wrong in the course of it, there is a

5

consequence, whether it be unexpected, merely, or

6

negligent in fact, and we don't have to prove fault in

order to get compensation for that consequence?
Would that be a satisfactory position for you,

8

and would it be a possible reading of the reg?
MR. HANNON:

10

Justice Souter,

I think that Your

11

Honor's articulation of the outcome is exactly what the

12

words of Congress said, that if there is an injury as a

3

result of the surgery and it meets the standard for

4

compensation as an additional disability, it matters not

5

what was intended or foreseeable.

6

is that it is a hazard, and I must say that --

QUESTION:

The point of the matter

Well, let me ask you, then, do you

8

think the regulation addresses the case of the procedure

which is totally inappropriate, the procedure which is

totally the result of negligence?

MR. HANNON:

I think the statute on its plain

language would cover the circumstance that Your Honor

5

posits here, because we're talking about hospitalization,

6

medical or surgical treatment, and if the question is

7

whether the misdiagnosis constitutes one of those

8

predicates, the Veterans Administration, the Department,
is obligated under the statutory requirement that they

10

broadly construe the acts of Congress to apply that

11

analysis to the benefit of the veteran.

12

their own regulations they're required to.

In fact, under

So in the situation that Your Honor has

hypothesized, there would undoubtedly be compensation

QUESTION:

Does it help you to say that your

reliance in some instances on foreseeability and intent

18

are relevant to determining whether or not there's an

additiohal disability?

20

That is to say, in the hypothetical of removal

21

of a lung with shortness of breath, we know, as a matter

22

of foreseeability, that the person is always going to be

23

disabled because of the bad lung, and it is intended, and

it is foreseeable, that there would be shortness of

condition of the veteran after the exposure to the

That is, when

that the diabetic goes into the hospital with poison in

the system and requires the amputation of a leg.

again, a situation where the condition of the veteran

before hospitalization is obviously a more diminished

intended outcome of the surgery, and that is the removal

But subsequently, Your Honor, when I argued on

6

behalf of Mr. Gardner as an amicus before the Court of

7

Veterans' Appeals, that very finding raised the question

8

as to whether this issue was factually ripe for a decision

9

by that court, and it was argued by me that there was

10

plenty of evidence in the record that indicated that

11

Mr. Gardner's condition was as a result of the surgery.

12

There indeed had been a medical examination by

13

the surgeon that concluded that his condition, both

14

conditions that Your Honor referred to, were as a result

15

of the surgery, and counsel on behalf of the Department

16

before the Court of Veterans' Appeals acknowledged the

17

case is ripe for a decision, it turns only on the

18

regulation, and that Mr. Gardner is, indeed, 100 percent

19

disabled as a result of the surgery, and that is the

record of the case.

10

MR. HANNON:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. HANNON:

They did not.
Okay.
In fact, one of the issues that the

13

Court of Veterans' Appeals asked the VA to address was the

14

significance of the surgeon's examination in which the

15

surgeon's opinion was that the condition was as a result

16

of surgery, and while that issue was addressed, it did not

17

inform the decision of the Court of Veterans' Appeals, and

18

I take it, quite frankly, that the Department would not

19

have asked this Court to hear the case if there were a

20

factual obstacle to reaching this particular decision.

21

In our view, there is no question that

22

Mr. Gardner is permanently disabled as a result of this

23

surgery, and therefore ultimately his entitlement to the

24

compensation will depend upon this Court's decision about

25

the regulation.

If you take

And yet, if the testimony, if the conclusion

have been perfectly fine if the leg had been left on, you

Now, to my mind, we're talking about

3

foreseeability in a medical context, and that

determination is an unreasonable one, makes no sense to

me, and cannot possibly inform the decision of the

The Office of General Counsel opinion which led
to that regulation dealt with exposure to HIV virus by

10

virtue of receiving a blood transfusion.

11

of the Office of General Counsel was that if the veteran

12

received a blood transfusion before it was known that you

13

could contract HIV, that was considered unforeseeable and

14

an accident, and you get compensation.

15

The conclusion

On the other hand, the veterans who were exposed

16

to HIV, contracted it, and died during the time period

17

when the VA knew that that was a possibility, aren't

entitled to compensation under 1151, and unless the

20

on a case-by-case basis, regulations such as this, and

their changing nature over the 70 years that we've seen

administration of this statute would be granted benefits

interpretation that the VA had of the statute at that

particular point in time.

5

Congress has not authorized the Veterans

Administration to make such policy choices.

Rather,

7

Congress has said that they must make rules and

Veterans' Appeals has a mandate to strike down those

1

To return just briefly, Justice Ginsburg, to

2

your question about -- and perhaps this is also your

3

question, Justice Stevens, about numbers, what I can tell

4

you is, on page 35 of our brief at note 20 we point out

5

that in 1 33, when the statute, after all, had just been

6

repealed, there were 66,000 admissions to VA hospitals for

7

nonservice-connected conditions, whereas in 1 34, when

8

Senator Steiwer was arguing for reenactment of this
provision, what he said was, there might be 65 or 67

10
11

people who were affected by reenacting section 213.
That has two significances.

One is, there were

12

quite a few people out there who presumably had some bad

13

consequence of care who were not getting benefits, and one

14

might have thought that they would bring this to the

15

attention of Congress if that was wrong, and the second is

16

that there were simply not very many people who were being

17

granted benefits under this statute when Congress

18

reenacted it in 1 34, and that gives us some idea of what

1

scope they had in mind when they reenacted it.

Justice Stevens, you had asked about why one
shouldn't interpret the statute -QUESTION:

Mr. DuMont, before you get off the

23

veterans who didn't complain to Congress that this statute

24

should have been cured, once this problem surfaced at two

MR. DuMONT:

I believe there was an attempt to

get the statute amended.

QUESTION:

In response to the Federal circuit

decision.
MR. DuMONT:

I don't believe it eventuated in

I believe that the VA made a

legislative proposal, but certainly nothing was enacted.
Justice Stevens, you asked about the sort of

10
11

you're-in-the-Army-now hypothetical, as Mr. Hannon put it.

12

We think the case of somebody who's in the Army is really

13

quite different from somebody who's in the hospital.

14

Congress has made the choice explicitly in a

15

statute to say that anyone -- in the line of duty has been

16

interpreted very broadly to mean anything that happens to

17

you while you are physically in the service.

18

hospital, we don't think Congress would have had any

19

reason to adopt the same kind of view and, in fact, that's

20

pointed up by the anomaly that respondent's position

21

creates.

In the

22

If you have a veteran with exactly the same

23

condition who goes to a private hospital and receives

24

exactly the same care, has exactly the same result, he

25

will not be entitled to any benefits under 1151 because it

wasn't VA care, and it's odd that Congress would have had

2

in mind having very different benefits regimes for

3

veterans who are really in very much the same position,

4

unless you think they had in mind something --

5

QUESTION:

The veteran in a private hospital

6

wouldn't fit into the hypothetical of being similar to

7

being someone in the service.

8

MR. DuMONT:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

But again, the question is -I'm not quite sure I understand the

thrust of your argument.
MR. DuMONT:

Well, again, the question is, what

12

is it that Congress would reasonably be thought to have

13

taken responsibility for, and I think they would have

14

taken responsibility for a range of circumstances that are

15

much the same as those that would have given rise to

16

recovery in the private hospital setting.

17

Again, you can make that -- you can see that

18

even more clearly by the fact that many of these people,

19

especially in the early days, were entitled to care only

20

on a space-available basis, so you might very well have

21

had a veteran with a nonservice-connected disability who

22

was turned away from a VA hospital only because there was

23

no space, went to a private hospital, he not only has to

24

pay for his care now, he doesn't get these disability

25

benefits, when in fact the care he received was identical

and was perfectly proper in both cases.

quite anomalous.

We think that's

Mr. DuMont, I was asking you earlier

QUESTION:

4

about just the law in general, and I guess we sort of came

5

to the conclusion that you really don't have to establish

6

a separate negligence rule, that it would be enough if you

7

had a rule that any reasonably anticipable consequence, if

8

that is a word, would not be triggered, this compensation.

9

How does that -- how would such a rule apply to

10

this case?

11

Was it decided only on the basis that there was no

12

negligence and therefore no compensation, or was there a

13

finding of both no negligence and also that the

14

consequences were an anticipable result of the operation?

15

How was this case decided by the courts below?

MR. DuMONT:

As Justice O'Connor pointed out,

16

there were really three sort of claimed additional

17

disabilities, two of them the board quite clearly found

18

bore no factual relationship to the surgery.

19

one, which was the left foot, they simply said that there

20

was no negligence.

case, and they didn't ever reach the question of --

22

25

The third

That's the way they disposed of the

QUESTION:

So to win the case up here we have to

agree with you that there is simply a no-negligence test.
MR. DuMONT:

Well, I don't think so.

I think

you could articulate the rule exactly the way you did, and

1

it might have to be remanded back to the Board of

2

Veterans' Appeals for further factual findings to see how

3

that test would be applied here, although I think the

4

natural assumption would be that if there was no

5

negligence then what they said was, look, this was a

6

common, foreseeable result of this surgery, and if that's

7

true, then we win under both bases.
QUESTION:

8

Mr. Hannon, I -- Mr. DuMont, I

thought the Board of Veterans Appeals said that the foot
10

problems were a common, foreseeable result of the surgery.
MR. DuMONT:

11

That's correct.

They said they

12

were a common, foreseeable result of the surgery, and

13

there was no indication of any kind of fault on the part

14

of VA.

15

think.

16

They're really two sides of the same coin, I

So one could either read their opinion to have

17

made a definitive finding on that issue and we win hands-

18

down, or one could read it to leave open some room for

1

foreseeability analysis that hasn't taken place and remand

20

it back, but I'm quite confident what the result would be

21

based on their opinion.

22

Just, in quick closing, we think that the

23

discussion with Mr. Hannon has clearly demonstrated our

24

fundamental point here, which is that the language of the

25

statute does not, on its face, resolve this question.

The

1

as-a-result-of language, the injury language, leave plenty

2

of room for interpretation.

3

And when we get down to questions like, is it

4

100 percent, or 75 percent, or 50 percent, or 5 percent

5

where one draws a foreseeability line, that is classically

6

the kind of decision that ought to be left in the hands of

7

the administrative agency that has been committed by

8

Congress with the task of interpreting the statute and

9

administering it, and I think that the VA has done a

10

perfectly reasonable job here, the courts below failed to

11

defer, and this Court should correct that error.

12

Thank you.
