ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KNEEDLER:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The court of appeals in this case held

11

12

unconstitutional a provision in section 5(e) of the

13

Federal Alcohol Administration Act that has regulated the

14

interstate sale of malt beverages for almost 60 years.

15

Specifically, paragraph (2) of section 5(e)

16

prohibits statements of alcohol content on the labels of

17

malt beverages unless such statements are required by

18

State law.

19

That provision was enacted soon after adoption

20

of the Twenty-First Amendment, and was designed to

21

implement it, and it reflected a considered judgment by

22

Congress, as stated in the House committee report, that

23

malt beverages should not be sold on the basis of alcohol

24

content.

25

This restriction serves the substantial

1

governmental interest of not facilitating or encouraging

2

the purchase or consumption of malt beverages for the

3

purpose of getting intoxicated.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

6

QUESTION:

7

Mr. Kneedler -Yes.

-- here is both an advertising ban

and a labeling ban --

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- for malt beverages?

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

11

QUESTION:

Yes.

But as I understand it, the

12

advertising ban applies only in States that have imposed

13

similar restrictions.

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

That's correct.

But the labeling ban applies unless

States affirmatively require disclosure.
MR. KNEEDLER:

That's correct.

By virtue of the

18

way the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has

19

construed it, the parenthetical clause in section 5(e)(2)

20

specifically addresses the interaction of State and

21

Federal law.

22

QUESTION:

Well, that leads to a very curious

23

result, because in a majority of States, then, it seems to

24

me that the statute would leave the brewers free to

25

advertise alcohol content on malt beverages but not to

1

place that information on the labels, and that just seems

2

a very odd scheme to me.

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I --

Am I correct?
There can be that difference in

6

those States, but first of all, I - - Congress could

7

reasonably conclude that having the alcohol content on the

8

bottle, on the very product that is the subject of the
commercial transaction, would enable -- facilitate impulse

10

buying at the point of sale, so at the very time the

11

consumer is going to buy --

12

QUESTION:

Well, I thought the defense was

13

something about encouraging price wars, or something, and

14

I would have thought that advertising it would be much

15

more likely to result in the problem --

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

17

QUESTION:

Right.

-- that the Government is concerned

18

about than would putting a truthful piece of information

1

on a label.

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, thus far, although I think

21

the materials suggest that we're beginning to see some

22

movement into traditional advertising, that has not been a

23

problem, and perhaps because advertising is often at a

24

national level, particularly media advertising, so that

25

advertising, if it's not lawful everywhere, for instance,
5

1

in network TV, that it wouldn't be placed because it

2

wouldn't be lawful in a number of States into which it

3

would go.

4
5
6

And of course, if the States perceive a problem
in this area, they may enact laws addressing that.
QUESTION:

But it certainly weakens the

7

Government's position with regard to the justification for

8

the labeling ban.

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, I think it -- first of all,

10

the point you're raising I think would only go to the

11

application, in any event, to the labeling ban in those

12

States that allow advertising but don't require the

13

labeling, and thus far in this case respondent has not

14

challenged the application of the labeling requirement on

15

a State-by-State basis in that manner, and again, the

16

substantial governmental interest here includes the

17

interest in accommodating State regulations, so the

18

labeling restriction applies unless a State strikes a

19

different balance.

20

Now, if in those States that have not prohibited

21

advertising the Federal regulation on labeling were

22

thought to be somewhat undermined, that would be a problem

23

only in those States.

24

burden of respondent's argument in this case.

25

But again, that has not been the

Respondent's submission of its labels to ATF was

across the board and, in fact, at page 61 of the Joint

2

Appendix respondent asks, specifically asks ATF to

3

consider its submission as a package, as a program,

4

including, in fact, both advertising and labeling

5

restrictions.

6

allowed it in the manner that you've described, and then

7

respondent brought this suit under the APA to challenge

8

ATF's restriction across the board.

ATF denied it except in those States that

If it -- if -- an as-applied, or a State-by-

9
10

State challenge of the sort you're describing, would be a

11

different lawsuit.
QUESTION:

12

Well, Mr. Kneedler, am I right in

13

thinking that the advertising ban is not being challenged

14

here?

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

That is correct.

The advertising

16

ban was sustained by the district court, and respondent

17

has not challenged that.

18

In fact, it's interesting, at page 35 of the

19

appendix to the petition, where the district court's

20

decision on remand is set forth, the district court

21

specifically acknowledges in the first paragraph on page

22

35a, I agree after hearing the evidence that attempts to

23

market alcohol content as a product attribute are not

24

legitimate attempts.

governmental policy.

They are contrary to substantial

That is precisely the judgment that was set

1
2

forth in the House report in 1935.

The district court

3

accepted that very judgment with respect to advertising,

4

but then inconsistently, in our view, declined to accept

5

and recognize the very same purpose as it applies in

6

labeling.

As this Court --

MR. KNEEDLER:

11

That is one type of labeling, but

12

that is not the sort of labeling that respondent is

13

promoting here.

It's signif --

QUESTION:

14

Well, they say it is.

They say they

15

want to inform the consumer about how much alcohol is in

16

the beer.
MR. KNEEDLER:

17

Well, with all respect, it seems

18

quite clear from the record in this case that respondent's

19

very purpose in challenging the labeling restriction

20

was - QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, are we to look at the

1

2

there can be a flat ban?
MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

It's relevant in this

3

precise -- in this particular sense, and it's a sense that

4

was recognized by this Court in both Posadas and in

5

Central Hudson, and that is that a restriction such as

6

this rests on the common sense judgment that a dampening

7

of advertising or promotion will dampen the demand for the

8

product, and in this case the restriction of the demand on

9

the basis of this particular attribute, alcohol content,

10

would dampen the demand to buy the product for the purpose

11

of getting intoxicated on the basis of that attribute.

12

In Posadas and Central Hudson - -

13

QUESTION:

Is it common sense to allow that to

14

be put on billboards but not on the label, and is it

15

common sense not to allow the percentage to be shown, but

16

to allow it to be called on the label and in advertising

17

malt liquor, or I suppose supermalt liquor?

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

With respect to malt liquor, in

19

particular, last -- in the spring of 1993, ATF solicited

20

public comments on precisely the use of malt liquor.

21

Historically malt liquor -- now, malt liquor is

22

understood as a category of malt beverage that has a

23

higher alcohol content, but historically malt liquor was a

24

term that encompassed the entire category of malt

25

beverages, and this is an understanding that goes way

back, so when those labels were first approved in the

2

early sixties, ATF presumably concluded that malt liquor

3

did not have a particular -QUESTION:

4

Had it changed its meaning by the

5

early sixties?

You don't think when it came out as malt

6

liquor in the early sixties that wasn't known to - MR. KNEEDLER:

7

Apparently -- apparently ATF does

8

not have an explanation in its records for why they were

9

approved, but this is now being considered.

But again, if

10

malt liquor is thought to be a particular problem, then

11

that's something that ATF can address under what

12

respondent concedes to be its powers under the other

13

labeling provisions, and ATF is considering precisely

14

that.

15

QUESTION:

Well, one step at a time is a fine

16

thing when you're not in the First Amendment area, but it

17

seems to me we demand a higher level of rationality when

18

you're prohibiting the conveying of information, and I

19

think it is, it seems to me, quite irrational to allow the

20

notion that this beverage contains a higher than ordinary

21

alcoholic content to be conveyed in all other ways but not

22

by saying it has 4 percent alcohol.

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

To reiterate, Justice Scalia,

24

that rationale would apply only in those particular States

where advertising was permitted and the labeling

QUESTION:

Much like Edge Broadcasting, this

Oh, I disagree.

You can say malt

liquor on the can.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Oh, I'm sorry, but with respect

7

to malt liquor, well, that -- that was not the basis of

8

the district court, or court of appeals judgment in this

9

case, and I think there is a question whether, I suppose a

10

legislative judgment for ATF to make in the first instance

11

whether malt liquor in fact conveys that sense.

12

QUESTION:

Is it true that ATF itself is giving

13

out the alcohol content?

14

like to know the alcohol content of Coors Beer, or some

15

other beer, the ATF --

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

If someone calls and says, I'd

Yes, one of the ATF witnesses at

17

trial said that, but again, that I think furthers --

18

highlights that this is not a blanket prohibition on any

19

public utterance or information about alcohol content.

20

QUESTION:

But if the Government is giving out

21

the information for the asking, what sense does it make to

22

prohibit that information on the label so that the

23

consumer will be saved a telephone call?

24
25

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, what it is, Justice

Ginsburg, is the difference between making information

available for consumers who want to look to that

2

information if they should want to compare on the basis of

3

selecting on the basis of low alcohol content, for

4

example, on the one hand, and on the other hand making,

5

not allowing brewers and others to use precisely the

6

alcohol content of the beverage for purposes of promoting

7

it, and this -QUESTION:

8

9

It seems to me, Mr. Kneedler, that if

you were to prevail in this case and one of us was

10

assigned the majority opinion, we'd begin by saying, the

11

Government has a legitimate interest in ensuring that

12

consumers are not fully informed, and then after that the

13

opinion would get rather difficult, it seems to me.

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, with all respect, Justice

16

Kennedy, in 1935, when Congress looked at this precise

17

question, and in fact before that in 1934, when the

18

Federal Alcohol Control Administration looked at this

19

question, there was virtually unanimous agreement among

20

the brewing industry itself that competition on the basis

21

of alcohol content specifically including the labeling

22

was - -

23

QUESTION:

Well, there probably was unanimous

24

agreement that all competition was undesirable, too, in

25

that time.

(Laughter.)

3

QUESTION:

4

Well, but

but

That was a pretty rigid industry in

1933 .

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

6

QUESTION:

Well, but first of all in the --

One of the classic examples, the

7

antitrust enforcement throughout this industry, at that

8

period.
MR. KNEEDLER:

9

Well, but the Twenty-First

10

Amendment, which had just been adopted, recognizes that

11

there can often be a very substantial governmental

12

interest in not promoting competition on the basis of, in

13

particular, alcohol --

14

QUESTION:

On the basis of alcohol content for

15

this rather limited product, but what about everything

16

else, like wine, and whiskey, and other alcoholic

17

beverages?

18
19

Why doesn't the same interest work there?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, the problem that Congress

had before it in 1934 --

20

QUESTION:

As the industry presented it.

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

-- was one specifically related

22

to malt beverage and the behavior of brewers in the malt

23

beverage industry that in fact had promoted beer as an

24

intoxicant rather than as a beverage or as a food type

25

beverage.

In Posadas, for example, the Court recognized

1

2

that Puerto Rico had not prohibited advertising concerning

3

all forms of gambling, but had focused on the particular

4

form of gambling that had led to the particular social ill

5

that was being addressed, in that case casino gambling,

6

and this case, in our view, is exactly like Posadas and in

7

fact - -

8

9

QUESTION:

But Mr. Kneedler, one thing we know

about Posadas is fairly recent, so the legislature could

10

have taken into account that commercial advertising is

11

subject to a First Amendment check.

12

back in 1935 there was no notion that commercial

13

advertising was within the First Amendment --

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

15

QUESTION:

16

I --

-- so that wasn't the attitude to

this kind of legislation more or less anything goes?

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

18

making in fact cuts the other way.

19

Isn't it true that

Well, I think the point you're

This statute was passed in the immediate wake of

20

the Twenty-First Amendment, which conferred on the States

21

what this Court has recognized as an extra measure of

22

power to regulate in the area of alcohol production and

23

sale and, in fact, traditionally the alcohol industry has

24

been subject to perhaps the most stringent regulations of

25

any area for -- and principally to regulate access to the

product.
QUESTION:

There was once a case in this Court

3

of a statute that regulated the sale of, in fact, a malt

4

beverage, and the law was defended -- this was the law

5

that said boys couldn't buy 3.2 beer until they are 21,

6

girls could at 18.

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

8

QUESTION:

9

Right.

The defense was, boys drive more,

drink more, commit more alcohol- related offenses.

All of

10

that was true.

11

Court held the law unconstitutional despite the Twenty-

12

First Amendment, so I don't buy your argument that because

13

we're in Twenty-First Amendment territory, therefore the

14

constitutional checks on Government action are so diluted

15

that we don't have to worry about them.

16

That was shown to be true, and yet this

MR. KNEEDLER:

I -- our submission is not that

17

the First Amendment is inapplicable in this context, and

18

in the case you're speaking of, that was a situation where

19

the State was operating in an area where class-based

20

stereotypes were simply not -- were not permissible.

21

In this case, first of all in the First

22

Amendment speech case, both before and after Craig v.

23

Boren, this Court has recognized in California v. LaRue

24

and subsequent cases that the First Amendment in

25

connection with the sale of alcohol has to be accommodated
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(800) FOR DEPO

1

or the State government may properly accommodate the First

2

Amendment to the compelling governmental interest in

3

regulating alcohol.
And in LaRue, in fact, the Court deferred to

4
5

what it termed the reasonable judgment by the California

6

legislature that nude dancing should not take place where

7

alcohol is sold even though it was alleged that the

8

conduct there should have been examined under the O'Brien
test, and the Court said that the O'Brien test was

10

unnecessary precisely because the State was operating in

11

an area governed by the Twenty-First Amendment.
And we think that if that rationale applied in

12

13

LaRue, it applies a fortiori here because what we were

14

talking - QUESTION:

15
16

Even though you don't have a nude

dancer.

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

But what we do have is, we think,

1

something even more compelling, and that is that this

20

Court has recognized that commercial speech is subject to

21

regulation precisely because it is closely related to

22

commercial transactions.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, what do we do if we

24

have a case in which Congress has a legitimate and

25

sustainable interest in restricting commercial speech when

1

it passes a statute, but then because of the passage of

2

time and changes in marketing and changes in consumer

3

habits, that interest is quite evidently, let's assume, no

4

longer legitimate, no longer compelling?

5

Is the statute then subject to attack, do you

6

think, or can you defend it on the grounds that at the

7

time it was enacted there was a legitimate interest?

8

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

Oh, I think the statute carries

with it a strong presumption that the circumstances that

10

gave rise to it continue to obtain, and I do - - and I

11

think it's important that what is being alleged here are

12

changes in the market, or changes in consumer preferences,

13

which are themselves subject to change and, in fact, one

14

thing that respondent doesn't acknowledge is that the very

15

consumer preferences that respondent is suggesting are

16

happening -- a push toward low alcohol beer -- are

17

undoubtedly influenced in large part by the very

QUESTION:

MR. KNEEDLER:

From 90 to 86 to 80.
Well, first of all, even if some

16

segments of the market, on average, the alcohol content is

17

going down, that doesn't mean that the governmental

18

purpose here is not directly advanced as to those portions

of the market where there would be promotion on the basis

of high content.

would happen?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Several things I would point to.

3

First of all was the very substantial evidence in 1934 and

4

1935 when this was first adopted by the Federal Alcohol

5

Control Administration and by Congress, and then today,

6

with respect to the malt beverage -- excuse me, the malt

7

liquor segment of the market, which is a market that I

8

think there's general acknowledgement it's a higher

9

alcohol content beer, or malt beverage, and it is promoted

10
11

on the basis of its alcoholic content.
And also, again, with respect to Coors, the

12

record contains cards that were handed out by Coors, and

13

in fact Coors entered into a settlement with ATF, or at

14

least handed out by a distributor, identifying the alcohol

15

content of Coors beverages as compared to other beers

16

within various price ranges.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, supposing that the

18

market is consumed of a variety of consumers, some of whom

19

want to get drunk as fast as they can, and they're the

20

people you're concerned about, and others of whom would

21

like to be careful and moderate in their drinking and be

22

able to drive without violating the statutes and so forth.

23

They have an interest in knowing how much alcohol is in

24

the beer, not for that purpose but for a good, legitimate

25

purpose of safety, and health, and all the rest.

Do we weigh their interest in the balance, or is

it sufficient to sustain the statute to say, well, maybe

want to get drunk, and we're going to focus on them and

Is that a sufficient justification for

For the most part, yes.

I mean,

8

9

in - - where the Court said it was up to the agency to

10

balance the judgment as to whether the off-peak and on-

11

peak electric demand would go up or down depending on what

12

sort of advertising would take place, and we think a

13

similar point is true here.

14

What there is, there may be competing interest

15

with respect to whether disclosure of the content would

whether not allowing promotion of the product on the basis

preferable approach.

that category of commercial activity.
QUESTION:

3

But the Twenty-First Amendment,

4

Mr. Kneedler, conferred authority on the States, not on

the Federal Government.

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, but this statute among other

7

things advances the State interest because States - - a

8

number of States, in fact almost every State, either by

9

operation of this statute or their own statutes, have a

10

restriction on labeling.
But my point is that the Twenty-First Amendment,

12

while conferring authority directly on the States, does

13

recognize in the Constitution itself the important

14

governmental interest in regulating alcohol.

Do you think that if we rule in favor

of Coors that the State statutes would necessarily be

Well, if the Court were to

broader factual findings, we wouldn't think that the

10

States should be foreclosed from doing that.
But again, the Twenty-First Amendment we think

2

concern was that beer -- unlike wine and spirits, beer

should not be sold on the basis of alcohol content because

at that time technologically it was impossible to

determine accurately the alcohol content of beer, so a

statement that this beer contains 3 percent, 4 percent,

5 percent, was inherently likely to be false and

Structurally, the fact that the same law

Yes.

the House report itself, and the Senate report itself, say

that the purpose of the bill is to prevent fraud and

deception.

And the reason for that was there was unrebutted

accurately determine the content of malt beverages, but

you could of wine and spirits.

Congress prohibited disclosure of alcohol content for beer

QUESTION:

When, between 1934 and the present,

4

did it become possible to measure the alcoholic content of

5

beer, because I remember in the service, all you could buy

6

in PX's was something called 3.2 beer, so apparently by

7

1943 they at least thought they had learned to measure the

8

content of beer.

MR. ENNIS:

Well, that's a good question, Chief

10

Justice Rehnquist.

11

in the record when that became possible, but it is

12

undisputed that it is possible, and that this ban cannot

13

be defended on the ground of preventing false and

misleading speech.

15

QUESTION:

I don't know the answer, and it's not

I take it the Government could defend

its statute on the grounds that even though there was no

legitimate purpose at the time of its enactment, a

MR. ENNIS:

Well, that's correct, Justice

Kennedy, and the Government has attempted to do that by

21

asserting in the lower courts the strength wars interest,

22

and now asserting in this Court the Twenty-First Amendment

QUESTION:

But you concede that at least as an

interest on the first prong, or, I guess, the second

prong, Central Hudson, that's a perfectly legitimate

interest for the Government to have, so your attack here

6

goes simply to whether it furthers, and whether it fits?

7

MR. ENNIS:

Your Honor, I do not dispute for

8

purposes of this case that the Government could have a

9

legitimate interest in deterring strength wars if that

10

means deterring people from continually increasing the

11

alcoholic content of their benefits.

QUESTION:

I do not dispute --

But the way you pose your -- put your

MR. ENNIS:

8

9

Justice Souter.

Oh, I understand your question now,

Let me be clear, then.

I do not dispute that the Government, namely the

10
11

executive branch, is today asserting a strength war

12

interest.

13

that Congress in 1935 had a strength war interest in mind.

14

I take that as given.

QUESTION:

What I do dispute is

Oh, agreed, but your answer to

15

Justice Kennedy, I thought, was that in fact the

16

Government interest could change over time, and I thought

17

it was implicit in what you said that the Government

18

doesn't have to reenact the statute for the purpose of

19

manifesting a new interest that could legitimately be

20

considered under Central Hudson.

MR. ENNIS:

2

In fact, overall, the overall effect of the labeling ban

is actually to disserve the Government's asserted interest

in strength wars.

QUESTION:

Isn't that a strange determination

for judges to make?

Congress and the other political branch that judges what

or not?

12

MR. ENNIS:

Your Honor, I think that's what

13

district judges are required to do under the Central

14

Hudson test, and appropriately so, because we're talking

15

about a ban on speech which is concededly truthful,

accurate, not misleading, and important to consumers.

The Government has actually conceded in this

3

case that its strength war objective could be fully

4

satisfied by a Federal alcohol content limit.

5

argues, however, that such a Federal limit would be

6

inconsistent with its Twenty-First Amendment interest.

7

That is plainly not so.

8

9

It lamely

Simply by providing the same kind of State
override for a Federal alcohol limit that the law already

10

provides for the labeling ban, the Government could

11

directly and more effectively achieve both of its asserted

12

interests, so even if the law marginally advanced the

13

Government's interest, it surely fails the reasonably

14

tailored prong.

QUESTION:

Can I go back for a second?

I need

16

some help on this point, which may be just a technical

17

point, but it is one I need some help on.

18

Suppose that -- I think, divide the States into

19

two categories, States that have an advertising ban, and

20

States that don't.

States, I don't know what interest this fulfills, this

And suppose I'd also thought that they've got

the interests of those 11 States who choose a State law to

All right, so that I'm thinking of

those 11.

interpret the statute that way?

MR. ENNIS:

QUESTION:

language supporting that.

constitutional as an effort to simply prevent what at that

That's what I think of that argument as being.

And then if you do interpret

the contrary construction.

But even if we're talking about a law that

MR. ENNIS:

9

We think that's the proper

Why?
Because if the State wanted to

prohibit accurate, truthful information on beer labels for

10

the same strength war objective, then on the record in

this case, because it would not advance that objective

whatsoever, that would violate the First Amendment.

QUESTION:

Or they have much more power, I take

MR. ENNIS:

Well first, Justice Breyer, as Chief

20

Justice Rehnquist noted in one of his questions, this is a

2

MR. ENNIS:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. ENNIS:

Let me turn --- to make that State ban effective?
Let me turn to that.

First of all,

5

it's not necessary, but even if it were, then the question

6

would be, could a State for these same reasons ban

7

labeling on beer, and the answer is no, because the First

8

Amendment would prohibit it.

9

The Twenty-First Amendment, as this Court ruled

10

in Crisp, is primarily a limitation on the Federal

11

Government's power under the Commerce Clause.

12

this Court said the Twenty-First Amendment does not

13

authorize the States to ignore their obligations under the

14

other provisions of the Constitution.

15

In Crisp,

In Craig v. Boren, this Court ruled that the

16

intermediate scrutiny test under the Fourteenth Amendment,

17

which is virtually indistinguishable from the commercial

18

speech test under Central Hudson, was not lowered or

19

lessened even in a State case because of the presence of

20

the Fourteenth -- of the Twenty-First Amendment.

21

It would be astonishing if this Court were to

22

rule that for some reason the standard of review under the

23

Fourteenth Amendment is not lowered because of the Twenty-

24

First, but the standard of review under the First

25

Amendment is.

In fact, turning to the First Amendment, in

MR. ENNIS:

Well, Chief Justice Rehnquist, that

raises a much more difficult and quite different question.
I know, as Your Honor wrote in Posadas, that it

15

has often been thought there is a common sense link,

16

without the need for evidence, between promotional

advertising that is designed to increase demand, and a

likelihood that it will increase demand, but it's a vastly

It is true that

4

this law already permits consumers to identify the highest

strength products, because it permits the use on the label

and in advertising of the term, malt liquor.
Now, Mr. Kneedler said that it's only some years

7
8

ago that malt liquor came to be known as the highest

9

strength malt beverage, but if you'll look at the 1935

10

hearings before the FACA regulations, you will see over

11

and over again there that at that time ale was thought to

12

be, and known to be, the highest strength beer product.

13

And there was questioning and testimony about

14

that, and the chairman and every witness said, it is okay

with us to allow you to use the word ale, as long as it's

truthfully ale, even though that means that consumers will

alcohol strength, you necessarily increase the bitterness,

the harshness, the roughness of the taste, and therefore

3

malt liquor has a much rougher, harsher taste than lower

alcohol products, which is precisely why most producers

are targeting the mid-market and lower.
Coors, for example, two-thirds of Coors' sales

are of its light beer product, which is 4.1 percent

alcohol.

that our light beer is 4.1 percent alcohol.

10

That's what they asked permission to do, to say

Clearly, Coors was not trying to attract the

11

high strength market there, because 4.1 percent is at the

12

low end, the bottom end of the mainstream range of beers

13

in this country, and why would Coors, which gets two-

14

thirds of its revenue from selling a light beer, want to

15

abandon that market, increase the beer strength, lose

16

those customers, and compete for 3 percent of the market?

nothing to do with alcoholic content.

It does have a great deal to do with

calories and alcohol, and light beer is supposed to be

23

lower in calories, as it is, and in order to do that, it's

24

necessary to make it lower in alcohol content as well.

But is it a fact that in the Tenth

Circuit argument Coors disclosed that its reason for this

litigation was to dispel the notion that Coors is a weak

10

MR. ENNIS:

Your Honor --

11

QUESTION:

Was that part of the argument?

12

MR. ENNIS:

I was not there, but that's

13

apparently what the transcript reflects, Your Honor.

14

Coors did want to dispel misleading impressions about the

15

strength of its products, but what it wanted to disclose

16

was the accurate, honest information about the strength of

17

its products, and that information would have shown that

18

its products were not the high strength products.

19

The Coors light beer is 4.1 percent -- that's

20

what it wanted to say -- which is at the low end.

The

21

other product it wanted permission to label was its

regular beer, which is 4.6 percent, which is the very midÂ­

point of the range in this country.

You can't.

You cannot.

If you happen to be in one of the two-thirds of the States

10

of this country that permit advertising, you can learn

11

that from the advertising, including advertising right in

12

the beer store next to the label, but this Federal law

13

bans that information from the label itself.

14

It obviously cannot directly and materially

15

advance the Federal Government's interests because of that

fact, and even if it did, as I pointed out earlier, there

is a simple, more effective way to control the strength

limiting the alcohol content except in States that permit

20

a higher limit.

21

The Government has conceded that that would

achieve -- fully achieve its strength wars interest.

There's no reason to ban truthful, accurate, and important

information in these circumstances.

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, you have 2 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

6

First of all, in response to questions by

7

Justice O'Connor and Justice Scalia, I call the Court's

8

attention to pages 65 and 336 of the Joint Appendix, which

9

include the wallet cards that Coors distributed listing --

10

comparing its alcohol content to those of others, in which

11

it was listing itself as highest, or close to the highest,

12

and also the advertisement that it asked ATF --

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

The highest light?
Well, the advertisement it asked

15

ATF to include lists both lights, on page 65 lists both

16

light beers and full-bodied beers, and it lists itself as

17

one of the highest content light beers, and also within

18

the mid-to-high range of the regular beer.

19

So the point is, Coors was holding itself out as

20

having at least an average, if not above-average alcohol

21

content within each segment of the market, which is

22

precisely what this is --

23

QUESTION:

The purpose served -- the purpose

24

served by this labeling reg in those 33 States that allow

25

you to advertise is?

MR. KNEEDLER:

1

2

The purpose is to prohibit --

it's a balance of the interest in labeling.
At the point of sale, there are two interests,

3
4

and the labeling, to be able to compare alcohol content at

5

the point of sale by picking up two bottles can lead to

6

impulse buying in the same way that this Court recognized

7

in the lawyer advertising case there can be impulse

8

decisions on hiring an attorney by virtue of the face-toface contact.
The second point that I wanted to make with

10
11

respect to the purpose of the - QUESTION:

12

In this evidence of wars, was there

13

anything about substitution of consumers who are looking

14

for higher alcohol content to wine, to something with --

15

or to the bitterer beverage, the malt liquor?
MR. KNEEDLER:

16

It was a discussion primarily

17

within the malt beverage industry, because that's where

18

the abuse was, and it was identified as an abuse, and I

1

call the Court's attention to the House report on page

20

16 - A.
QUESTION:

21

Couldn't this regulation make it

22

worse?

23

time you see a lot of cheap wine around, perhaps as many

24

as those bottles of beer.

25

I mean, if you go to New Orleans at Mardi Gras

MR. KNEEDLER:

Justice Ginsburg, no.

The

statute has been construed by ATF to allow disclosure of

2

low alcohol content beer, so it's tailored to limiting the

concern about marketing on the basis of high alcohol

content and intoxication.
