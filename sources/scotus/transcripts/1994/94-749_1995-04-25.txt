CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHESTER DARLING

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

12

MR. DARLING:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The central issue in this case is whether

13

Government can mandate the expression of messages and

14

viewpoints in a privately organized parade over the

15

objections of the private organizers.

16

After ordering the respondent, the Irish-

17

American Lesbian, Bisexual, and Gay Group of Boston, into

18

the 1992 and 1993 parades, and after a hearing before a

19

trial court, a judgment issued and was affirmed

20

supreme judicial court of Massachusetts, and in that

21

judgment the supreme judicial court upheld a statement and

22

declaration by the trial court that a proper celebration

23

of St. Patrick's and Evacuation Day requires diversity and

24

inclusiveness.

25

This pronouncement reflects only one of the

plain errors and misapplications of well-settled law that

requires reversal and a vacation in this action.

3

The Veterans Council clearly stated what the

4

expressive purpose of their parades were.

5

during trial and prior to their application, filing their

6

application itself, that they wished to celebrate their

7

traditional religious and social values.

8

9

QUESTION:

They announced

Well, Mr. Darling, my recollection is

that the trial justice in this case made a finding that

10

that was not -- that based partly on his,

11

disbelief of one of the witnesses, or doubt about the

12

witness' credibility, this was not kind of an idea-

13

centered parade.

14

MR. DARLING:

I guess,

Your Honor, the facts in this

15

case, where we have raised a claim, a First Amendment

16

claim, and where the expressions of my client have been

17

altered, we're asking that strict scrutiny be applied.

18

that is done, then it will be seen that there were no

19

facts at all to support any conclusion that my clients

20

either discriminated or were conducting anything other

21

than their own celebratory parade.

22

QUESTION:

If

Well, you're entitled to more careful

23

review on a First Amendment factual issue, certainly, than

24

otherwise, but still credibility issues have been

25

traditionally for the trier of fact, even in that area.

MR. DARLING:

1

Mr. Chief Justice, as far as the

2

credibility of Mr. Hurley was concerned, that related to

3

testimony that he gave in response to questions asking at

4

what stage did they reject and why did they reject the

5

group as a marching unit.
QUESTION:

6

But the Chief Justice's question

7

interests me also.

What is the evidence to show that the

8

purpose of this parade was to express any viewpoint?

9

MR. DARLING:

10

expressive, Justice -QUESTION:

11

The parade is inherently

Well, do you want us to make a

12

finding, than, that a parade is per se an expressive

13

activity?

14

MR. DARLING:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. DARLING:

Yes, I do, Your Honor, and --

Does your case depend on that?
No, sir, but what follows is that

17

unless my clients or future parade applicants receive the

18

protection of this Court they will be exposed to the

19

injunction and the onerous terms that have been applied by

20

both the trial court and affirmed by the supreme judicial

21

court in compelling them to either voice a message that's

22

mandated by the State or remain silent, or in order to

23

modify the injunction, to return to the court with hat in

24

hand asking if their speech finally met the focus and

25

diversity and inclusiveness that this case mandates in my

client's First Amendment parades.
QUESTION:

Mr. Darling, you've answered, I

3

guess, two questions, and I want to make sure that you

4

stand by the answer in each one, and I want you to comment

5

again on the relevance of each one.

6

The first is you, I think you told Justice

7

Kennedy not only that the parade was expressive in its

8

nature -- I guess all parades are in your view -- but that

9

that was crucial to your case.

You also said that the

10

particular message, the viewpoint, if you will, was

11

generally a celebration of religious and social values of

12

Irish Catholics.

Is that viewpoint crucial, the existence

3

of that viewpoint as the expression conveyed by the

4

parade, crucial to your case?

5

MR. DARLING:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. DARLING:

I would think not, Justice Souter.

Okay.
The fact that any parade is

8

inherently expressive, coupled with the fact that

9

realistically nowadays people make applications for parade

20
21

permits, as has been done in this case -QUESTION:

May I just interrupt you and get to

22

another point?

You're saying that your viewpoint is not

23

essential to your case, and I take it you're saying it's

24

not essential to your case that your parade have any

25

viewpoint at all.

MR. DARLING:
n
Z

3

QUESTION:

That's correct.

But is it essential to your case that

the parade be expressive?

4

MR. DARLING:

No, it's not.

As far as I'm

5

concerned, if my clients march down a street on a permit

6

that's issued by the City of Boston, whether it's a moving

7

assembly or a group of persons, there will be some people

8

that will make a determination that my clients or that

9

group of people are expressing something.
QUESTION:

10

This case --

No, but let's assume they are wrong.

11

Let's assume that in fact they are expressing nothing, so

12

that the parade stands on the same footing, let's say, as

13

a public restaurant, would the result be the same in this

14

case?

15
16

MR. DARLING:

If it was a permitted activity and

there was no expression involved, probably not, Justice --

17

QUESTION:

Okay.

18

QUESTION:

Well, I'm not sure.

I take it -- and

19

we can ask the respondents.

20

position of the respondents is that they want to proclaim

21

a message.

22

MR. DARLING:

23

QUESTION:

I take it that the whole

They do indeed, Justice --

And it seems to me that your answer

24

would be that even if your parade is nonexpressive in its

25

history and in its tradition, that you have the right to

MR. DARLING:
QUESTION:

3
4

Well,

Your Honor --

Or is that your -- it seems to me

that's a plausible position.
MR. DARLING:

5

We have a judgment that made a

6

finding that it was impossible to discern any specific

7

expressive purpose in my client's First Amendment

8

activity, but this Court has access to the exhibits,

particularly a video tape that demonstrates without

and

11

activity with viewpoints and political messages and

12

celebrating their religious values.

clients are expressing.

The judge,

acknowledged and identified those very values my

QUESTION:

Well,

just hypothetically,

let's

6

assume,

7

that this parade was like a picnic or something that had

8

no expressive purpose whatsoever.

9

Let's assume hypothetically.

20

following Justice Souter's line of questioning,

That may be wrong.

It seems to me that you still have an argument,

21

and maybe you don't think you do.

22

still have an argument that even if it is neutral in its

23

custom and in its format, you have the right to say that

24

it cannot be used for some other person's message.

Justice Scalia, but the fact is that any group of people

or any individual cannot be compelled to speak in behalf

QUESTION:

Mr. Darling, I thought you said you

couldn't do whatever you wanted with a parade.

I thought

9

you conceded that you could not exclude gays, lesbians,

10

and bisexuals from marching in the parade if they want to

11

march, so long as they are not trying to convey a message

12

which you do not want conveyed.

13

You don't contest that the Massachusetts law is

14

applicable to the parade insofar as the exclusion of

15

someone simply for being a homosexual or lesbian or a

bisexual is concerned, right?

Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, the

messages contained in my client's parade are numerous and

powerful messages.

Now, that group had been excluded for several years

that appears in the record, and he was not disturbed.

And Mr. Hurley did not have him excused from the

clients to include GLIB with their sexual orientation

7

with an antigay message on it, and assisted by the police

8

they were thrown out of the parade.

My clients do not care about the sexual

orientation or the religious background or the ethnic

11

composition of anyone in their parade.

QUESTION:

1

Just -- you wouldn't let a person in

2

just because he was Afro-American, that was your only

3

reason?

4

MR. DARLING:

Justice Breyer, my clients, if

5

they wish to discriminate on the basis of their speech, in

6

their speech they can, but as far as discriminating

7

independently of their speech, that is conduct, and --

8

9

QUESTION:

No, no, that's not my point.

My

point actually is that there's a factual finding in this

10

record, I take it -- the SJC says that the judge found

11

that GLIB was excluded from the parade because of the

12

sexual orientation of its members.

13

Now, that's a finding that we have here, and so

14

is that finding -- are we supposed to accept that, or

15

reject that?

16

I take it that there's a finding that the parade

17

normally includes everybody, and however they didn't

18

include these people not because they weren't proud to be

19

Irish, they were, but because they didn't like their

20

sexual orientation.

21

Now, I just read that sentence is what it said

22

in the SJC, so are you saying that you do have a right to

23

exclude because of the sexual orientation, or are you

24

saying that wasn't why they were excluded, and if it's the

25

latter, what do we do about the fact-finding?

I'm suggesting that the finding of

on the very basis of the words you have just read.

MR. DARLING:

So you're saying the fact-finder -The trial judge equated the sexual

orientation with messages and values. In my book, if you

combine a message and a value you've got a viewpoint, not

Would that include complete review of

sexual orientation, that they excluded them for who they
were, not what they said.
QUESTION:

Well, do you agree that we can review

that in a First Amendment case, that we can review that
finding and address Justice Breyer's question so that
perhaps that finding is in fact not dispositive for us?
MR. WARD:

The Court can certainly review the

facts in a First Amendment case to determine whether or
not First Amendment rights have been violated.

However, a

finding of discrimination is uniquely dependent upon
credibility, and even in Hernandez v. New York, for
example, the Court pointed that out, even where
constitutional rights are implicated.
QUESTION:

Well, do you contest -- I assume you

concede that your clients wanted to be in the parade
because they wanted to proclaim a message.
MR. WARD:

Well, I think the term "message" as

it's been used in this case really is more confusing than
illuminating, Justice Kennedy.
My clients wanted to be included in the parade.
They -- the trial -- they wanted to be included in what
the trial judge found to be an open recreational event.

I'm taking the position that when all

In the same sense that a black person

marching in the parade, I take it, would be proud of his
or her identity.
QUESTION:

That's right, and if that person held

up a sign and said, black unity, that would be an
expression of pride in blackness.
MR. WARD:

Except that generally speaking,

5

lesbians, gay men, and bisexual people are not immediately

evident to the --

7

QUESTION:

Exactly.

I mean, the point at issue

8

is whether there's an expression of anything in their mere

9

marching with a sign saying what they are, and it seems to

20

me you must acknowledge that it is -- there is an

21

expression of pride in what they are.

MR. WARD:

I would call it self-identifying,

QUESTION:

May I ask you a question, Mr. Ward?

3

It's really remarkable in this case, it seems to me, both

4

of you seem to agree on the applicable law.

5

they can't exclude you because of who you are, and you

6

agree they can exclude you if you're sending a message.

They agree

7

So the real question is, how do you decide which

8

it is, and the point, the question is, for me at least, do

9

you answer that question by looking at your motive, their

10

interpretation of what you look like, or the reasonable

11

neutral person's interpretation of the sign?

standard?

MR. WARD:

What is the

I

14

think that's what's illustrative here, are the tests that

15

the court has used in the club cases. It's an objective

question.

17

It's an objective question.
You look at two things.

You look at what kind

18

of event the council has created, what the court found

19

that it was an open recreational event, and then you look

20

at the impact of the inclusion of the unwanted group on

21

that event.

22

In this case -- and this Court's cases have

23

suggested that if a group is so organized around a

24

discernible specific expressive purpose that the mere

25

inclusion of the unwanted group would seriously disable

In this case --

entitled to maintain the purity of that expression.

QUESTION:

Newspapers, for instance, can't be

required to print retraction articles.
MR. WARD:

Exactly.

However, what the trial

11

judge found and what the supreme judicial court affirmed

12

was that the relationship of the council to this event was

13

that of standing basically indifferent to the messages,

14

that that's what really happened, and that that --

15

QUESTION:

Well, but I think even if that were

16

so historically they could change their position when

17

another group wants to have a message.

18

MR. WARD:

Well, I think that clubs often did

19

that when they wanted to exclude black people, and this

20

Court consistently said you can't reorganize around a

21

racist purpose and become thereby a private club.

the analogy fits here.

would say yes, there's an expression going on here, but

2

nevertheless the evidence was very clear that the real

motive was that they didn't want you to march with them,

which is what that found, that real motive would really

excluded you whether or not there was a message, but maybe

they can get away with it if there's a message.

MR. WARD:

That's

I think what that really means,

Justice Stevens, is there are some circumstances under

which discrimination is incidental.

of Maryland with members only, and the NAACP wanted to

march alongside of them.

unwanted group would destroy the message.

That's a far

judicial court both found an open recreational event in

2

which the parade organizers, despite what they later said,

3

which was found to be basically pretextual, stood more or

4

less indifferent to the messages.

5

Upon the arrival of the hated group, or the

6

unwanted group, let's say, they immediately assert that we

7

have always organized around a specific expressive purpose

8

that excludes the mere presence of this group.

9

The trial judge didn't buy it.

Frankly, I don't

10

blame him.

And the remedy that he ordered was, treat them

like everybody else.

12

to come in with some sign saying whatever they wanted to

say.

they can discriminate on the basis of viewpoint.

sexual orientation and forbids discrimination on that

MR. WARD:

Exactly.

That's the given.

All right.

Now,

under those circumstances, is it actually motive that is

irrelevant?

I mean, if in fact the real reason were

because of sexual orientation and the group doesn't really

QUESTION:

Why does that show discrimination on

MR. WARD:

Because --

It might show casting about for

something that the trial court would accept.
MR. WARD:

To the trial judge and to me it shows

that the person was not being credible in his

14

explanations, that his real basis was discrimination based

15

on sexual orientation.

conclusion. It leads to the conclusion that he's trying to

come up with something that the court will accept.
