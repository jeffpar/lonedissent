ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL BENDER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. BENDER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case concerns the constitutionality of the

11
12

honorarium provision contained in the Federal Ethics

13

Reform Act of 1989, a provision that prohibits Federal

14

employees in all three branches of Government from

15

accepting compensation beyond ordinary and necessary

16

travel expenses for making appearances, giving speeches,

17

or writing articles.

18

Regulations of honoraria of this kind for these

19

same activities have been part of Federal statutory law

20

since the mid-1970's.

21

a total ban, but a monetary limit on the amount that

22

Federal employees could be paid in honoraria.

23

$1,000 per appearance and a $15,000 annual limit that was

24

later raised to $2,000 per appearance and a $25,000 annual

25

limit.

In 1974, Congress imposed a -- not

It was

In 1981, the annual limit was removed, but the

2

$2,000 limit remained.
In the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, Congress

3

decided to, instead of dealing with this by putting a

4

monetary limit on the amount that a Federal employee could

5

obtain through honoraria for these activities, to

6

eliminate them altogether.

7

It did this on the advice of two Federal

8

Commissions, one the Quadrennial Commission, which makes

9

periodic reports and gives advice on Federal salaries, and

10

the other an ethics commission, Ethics in Federal

11

Government Commission, appointed by President Bush in the

12

last 1980's.

13

Both of those commissions recommended that the

14

policy be changed from a limit on the amount of honoraria

15

to total prohibition of Federal employees in all three

16

branches obtaining honoraria.

17

Congress did this, as well, in light of very

18

strong public concern about the use of honoraria for those

19

activities as a way of steering compensation to Federal

20

employees who might have, when the person steering the

21

compensation might have some reason to want some favors or

22

special treatment from the Federal employees.

23

That had been most prominent with regard to

24

Members of Congress and congressional staffs, but the

25

commissions recommended, and Congress followed their

1

advice, that it made sense to apply the ban across the

2

board and not just to limit it to the legislative branch.

3

Initially, it did not apply to the Senate, or

4

Senate staff members, and in response to that, the Senate

5

decided not to take a pay raise that went to the House at

6

that time, but a couple of years later, the Senate voted

7

itself into the ban, it and its staff, so that the ban now

8

applies to all Federal employees in all three branches of

9

Government.

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Bender, in the definitions

11

section, 505(3), which defines the term, honorarium,

12

apparently it was amended to add some parenthetical

13

material so that it now provides -- "the term, honorarium,

14

means a payment of money or anything of value for an

15

appearance, speech, or article (including a series of

16

appearances, speeches, or articles, if the subject matter

17

is directly related to the individual's official duties,

18

et cetera)."

19

MR. BENDER:

20

QUESTION:

Right.
I am unclear what the purpose of that

21

amendment was.

22

a person can't get an honorarium for a single speech or

23

article, but can if the person gets several, and I just

24

don't understand what we do with a provision like that.

25

It seems to provide, as it's written, that

MR. BENDER:

When I first saw that, it seemed to

1

me that a person had made a typographical error, and that

2

the parenthesis should have been moved up several words,

3

but the history of the statute shows that it was, in fact,

4

intended to be exactly as it was written.
As originally written, that whole parenthesis

5
6

7

was - QUESTION:

You mean, you think that it was

8

intended to, as structured with the other provisions of

9

the statute, to prohibit an honorarium if it's a single

10
11

speech or article, but to allow it if there are several?
MR. BENDER:

Yes, I think that's the clear

12

intention, because at the time in Congress there was a

13

proposal to apply the nexus requirement.

14

says that the honorarium is prohibited only if it's

15

directly related to the official's -- to the individual's

16

official duties, or payment is made because of the

17

individual's status with the Government.

That is, which

18

There was a proposal in the Senate to apply that

19

to the whole definition, and that failed, and instead this

20

was put in.

MR. BENDER:

25

I don't think that makes sense.
It seems counterintuitive.
Is that absurd?
I don't think it's absurd, although

I admit that it is counterintuitive.

QUESTION:

1

2

You can get hung for a sheep -- for a

lamb, but not for a sheep.
MR. BENDER:

3

Well, I think the difference is

4

that first of all the reason they did that was that the

5

statute, as originally written -- if you just leave out

6

the parenthesis, you will see how it was originally

7

written.
It says, for an appearance, speech, or article,

8

9

and there was confusion about whether the statute would

10

apply to a series, because it was stated in the singular,

11

and this was put in to make it clear that it did apply to

12

a series, because that wasn't clear before.
The difference, I think, between a series and an

13
14

individual speech can be seen if you think about the

15

reason for the prohibition in the first place.

16

problem with honoraria -- honoraria, not any payment for

17

anything you do.

18

in the Federal Government.

19

The

Moonlighting is not generally prohibited

The problem with honoraria is that they can be

20

paid for relatively little or no work.

You can make an

21

appearance without doing any work.

22

You can make a speech without doing very much work.

23

can write an article and have somebody else write it for

you and put your name on it, or circulate the same article

again.

You can just go there.

Those are the things that the statute meant to

QUESTION:

Somebody can pay you money as a

9

MR. BENDER:

There's no question of that,

10

Justice Scalia, and I think it would be possible for

11

Congress to have broadened this and made it a much broader

12

ban on lots of other outside compensation.

13

Congress - QUESTION:

14

I think

The question is whether it's rational

15

if it just selects one way in which you can get paid for

16

doing nothing and does not select any of the other ways in

17

which you can get paid for doing nothing.

MR. BENDER:

Ordinarily, Congress does not have

to deal with all problems.

QUESTION:

Mr. Bender, on the subject of doing

out into a series, is somehow a guarantee that there is

2

more work that will be done, is problematic.
MR. BENDER:

3

It's obviously not an absolute

4

guarantee.

This is a broad, prophylactic statute.

5

lines are not absolutely precise.

The

6

If this were a statute dealing with a

7

prohibition on speech, rather than merely a prohibition on

8

payment for speech, if this were a statute dealing with

9

people who were not Federal employees, that kind of

10

grossness of the statute I think would pretty clearly make

11

it unconstitutional.

12

QUESTION:

Might not the parenthetical material

13

that we've been discussing, Mr. Bender, have been intended

14

to allow someone to teach a course?

15

MR. BENDER:

That's one of the functions that --

16

that's one of the functions that it serves, and I think

17

that's a good example of the kind of thing which is not

18

likely to produce a payment made to curry favor with a

19

Federal employee and is much more likely to be made

20

because of some real value that the person has given.

21

It's hard to teach a whole course and not do any work.

22

It's a lot easier to give a single speech.

23

These are not perfect lines.

It is obvious that

24

a speech can reflect a lot of work, and a series of

25

speeches, the Office of Government Ethics has interpreted

series to mean three -- certainly you could do three

2

speeches without doing a tremendous amount of work, but

what Congress was trying to do here, and I think it's

important to bear that in mind, is not to be overbroad.

6

without - - without casting doubt on the integrity of the

7

Federal Service, it wanted to preserve as much as possible

8

the opportunity to earn some money on the side.
QUESTION:

9

Well, Mr. Bender, this -- it would

10

make a lot more sense if the opening of the parenthesis

11

were inserted just before "if," and after "series of

12

appearances, speeches, or articles."

13

clear that honorarium means payment of money or anything

14

of value for an appearance, speech, or article, or a

15

series of appearances, speeches, and articles, if the

16

subject matter is directly related.

17

MR. BENDER:

Then it would be

I agree with you, Justice O'Connor.

If I were doing it, that's what I would have done, and

19

many people in Congress wanted to do that, but the

Well, maybe it was just a drafting

They just put the parenthesis in the wrong place.
MR. BENDER:

The legislative history I think

24

makes it clear that it wasn't just a drafting error

25

because, as I say, there was a proposal to add that nexus

1

limitation to the whole thing, and that proposal failed,

2

and this proposal passed.
The issue is not what you or I think would make

3
4

more sense.

The issue is whether what Congress has done

5

is unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

6

But it does present you with a

7

different problem here, and that is, part of your argument

8

for sustaining the breadth of the ban is the difficulty in

9

line-drawing if you were to have a narrower ban, and yet

10

here is an example in which you've got to do some line-

11

drawing, in which Congress in effect is saying, yes, we

12

can draw lines if we want to, because there is a

13

germaneness requirement in the series.

14

MR. BENDER:

In the series, yes, and I think the

15

reason for that, or the explanation for that, might well

16

be that there are many less cases where people do a

17

series.

18

For example, some people teach courses, but

19

there aren't very many of those, and therefore it's

20

possible for the ethics officials who have to administer

21

this to have to deal with that small number of cases.

22

QUESTION:

Well, I can --

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Bender, can you explain on the

24

question of exceptions why one appearance or one writing

25

is okay if you are faculty or a student of a military

1

school?

What was the basis for allowing that exception?
MR. BENDER:

2

I believe it was, Congress wanted

3

to make the exception for the military, and I think it had

4

to do with -- I can explain this much more easily for the

5

faculty than the students.

6

The faculty of military academies wanted to be

7

considered on the same plane, and I think they should be

8

considered of the same plane, as faculty of other
institutions, and to say that they could not make speeches

10

for compensation the way other faculty members do treats

11

them as not really like regular faculty members.

12

that was the reason for doing it.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. BENDER:

15

students.

16

I think

And the students?
I have no explanation for the

Congress decided to make the exception.
But I think here there are things that will

occur to all of us, and when you read the regulations, you

18

can see other things that occur to you.

There are things that seem to be irrational, but

if you think of it from the point of view of

23

administrability, I think the rationale becomes a little

24

clearer.

speech.

3

would agree that if the speech is directly connected to

the work of the person, then Congress may ban it.

statute requires that evaluation - -

7

MR. BENDER:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. BENDER:

Right, but with a series it's --- so it just doesn't make sense.
I think with a series it's easier

10

to know what the subject matter is.

11

Justice Rehnquist's example of someone teaching a course,

12

a course will have a name, the course will have a

13

description, the university will require the course to be

14

tailored to the name and the description, so you can

15

tell -- I think more easily with a series you can tell

16

whether or not the subject matter is a problem.

17

For example, in Chief

And also I think the intention was to permit

18

teaching, because Congress probably thought that teaching

19

by some Federal officials was something that was very

20

strongly in the public interest.

21

22

23

QUESTION:

It isn't limited to teaching.

It

doesn't even say teaching.
MR. BENDER:

Right, and again, it's blunter than

24

it might be.

25

bluntness -- there's no question that, I think -- I think

The question for the Court is whether that

1

it's common ground both with the court of appeals and with

2

respondents that there is a core of activity to which this

3

statute plainly constitutionally applies.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. BENDER:

6

7

Mr. Bender -If a member of the Solicitor

General's office were to -QUESTION:

-- would you explain something to me?

8

I really have to say I'm kind of puzzled about the reason

9

why the content of the speech or writing makes any

10

difference at all.

If you want to curry favor with

11

someone by paying them something that they haven't really

12

earned, what difference does it make whether they write a

13

lyric poem, a mystery story, or talk about what they do

14

every day at the office?

15

MR. BENDER:

16

problems, but there are others.

17

member of the Solicitor General's Office was asked to go

18

to a law firm and give a talk about tips on arguing before

19

the Supreme Court, sharing your experience.

20

with that kind of thing is, the people who can pay for

21

that information, gleaned or amassed as part of one's

22

Federal employment, can get information from a Federal

23

officer that people who can't pay for it can't get.

24
25

Currying favor is one of the
For example, suppose a

The problem

lectures about the work he does to drug companies or

1

insurance companies about the work he does, and that

2

information just goes to those people.
So I think to have a Federal employee be paid

3
4

for talking about the work the Federal employee does

5

raises a different concern, which is that people who are

6

able to pay for it shouldn't be able to get information

7

from Federal employees that people who can't pay for it

8

can't get.

9

QUESTION:

Would you agree that insofar as your

10

concern with corruption, the subject matter doesn't make

11

any difference?

12

MR. BENDER:

13

QUESTION:

I agree with that, right.
Under that theory a Federal employee

14

shouldn't be able to publish a book.

15

can get the information from a book are those who can

16

afford --

17

MR. BENDER:

The only people who

There's a balance I think that

18

Congress is drawing in saying that a book is likely to be

19

so valuable that we want to permit people to do it, and a

20

book is easier to police, because it's a public thing that

21

is published and can be seen and can be looked at by an

22

ethics official to see whether there's anything in the

23

book that compromises the Federal official, whereas

24

speeches are evanescent, they're gone.

1

An appearance is even harder to judge, and even

2

with regard -- for example, if somebody makes a speech at

3

a garden club to talk about how to grow roses, and the

4

person who does that is a lawyer in the Department of

5

Justice, that seems perfectly innocent, but maybe the head

6

of the speaker's bureau of the garden club has a case

before that lawyer.

8

ethics official ever know that?

QUESTION:

How in the world would the Federal
I think it's --

Mr. Bender, in the event that your

10

main argument doesn't prevail, may I ask what you think of

11

the Silberman solution by way of a remedy, which would in

12

effect be changing the place of the open paren?

13

MR. BENDER:

I think that, or something very

14

similar to it, is the correct solution.

15

feels that Congress did not have the right to write a

16

broad, prophylactic statute here and that the extension to

17

honoraria that have no nexus is unconstitutional, then the

18

right remedy is to say that the statute cannot be applied

to those honoraria rather than - -

data do we have to make that assessment, or did Congress

6

have to make it?

7

MR. BENDER:

I think Congress has no formal

8

empirical data but its understanding of the way Federal

9

Government works and what Federal employees do, and that's

10
11
12

13

what you have to use as well.
I think because it's so hard to know the facts
there, deference to Congress is appropriate.
QUESTION:

If we thought, or the Congress

14

thought, that the improper kind of speaking takes place

15

only 5 percent of the time, would that have been enough to

16

sustain this statute?

17

MR. BENDER:

I think that would be very

18

doubtful, but I'm almost positive that those would not be

19

the facts here.

20

There are people who have hobbies, and there are

21

people who make some money on their hobbies by giving

22

speeches or writing articles, but I think it is almost

23

worthy of judicial notice that it's much, much more likely

24

that people will speak about their work, the things that

25

they do for most of their time, and that the dangers of

2

3

paid to speak about the things that they work on, than

4

5

QUESTION:

When we're making this assessment and

6

this evaluation, since speech is involved, is there some

7

heightened form of scrutiny?

8

MR. BENDER:

There is certainly some heightened

form of scrutiny, but I think two things, and as I said
10

before, I think if this statute were a prohibition on

11

conduct of non-Government employees, or even perhaps a

12

prohibition on conduct of Government employees, the answer

13

might be different.

14

But here, I think two factors which go to

15

permitting Congress to do this are 1) that this does not

16

prohibit any speech at all, it prohibits compensation for

17

speech, and these are all people who have another job, and

18

so it is unlikely in many cases that the compensation will

1

in any sense be necessary to permit them to give the

20

speech, and if it is necessary to permit them to give the

21

speech, that raises other problems.

employees dependent upon this kind of outside income, I

think Congress could be worried about that.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. O'DUDEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In its brief, the Government has offered three

23

main justifications for the statute.

24

is needed to guard against the appearance of impropriety,

25

it has argued that this is a needed prophylactic measure,

It has said that it

28

SUITE 400

1

and it has also said that there are administrative reasons

2

that justify the existence of the statute.

3

Much of the discussion this morning has focused

4

on the last justification.

5

correctly, it is agreeing that there is no appearance of

6

impropriety when a career employee writes or speaks about

7

something that has no connection to his job, and where the

8

payor has no interest pending before the Government.

9

If I understand the Government

But what the Justice Department seems to argue

10

this morning is that even if that's the case, it's just

11

too hard to enforce a nexus requirement, and with all

12

respect to the Justice Department, I believe that that

13

argument is just a bit thin.

14

As we know, as Justice O'Connor has pointed out,

15

the Achilles heel in each of the -- with respect to each

16

of the justifications here is the fact that an employee

17

can receive compensation if he or she writes a series of

18

articles, and, of course, what that means with respect to

19

the statute is, you can't be paid if you write one or two

20

articles, but if you repackage it as three or more, then

21

you can be paid, provided there is no nexus to employment.

22

It seems to us that the fact that there is a

23

nexus test written right in the statute is very good

24

evidence that a nexus test is eminently manageable.

25

question was raised earlier, what concrete experience do

The

1

we have as to how much of a burden it is to administer a

2

nexus requirement?
Well, we would point the Court to a report that

3
4

the Government believes, at least in its brief, supports

5

its position, and I'm speaking here about the GAO report,

6

which, of course, covered a 3-year period and examined

7

outside activities that were engaged in by Federal

8

employees.

9

And if I read the report correctly, and added up

10

the numbers correctly, there were about 2,500 employees

11

who had received approval to engage in outside activities,

12

the report identifies two instances where there were

13

arguable improprieties with respect to the speaking

14

activities.

15

So in essence, what the report has said is that

16

out of 2,500 occasions, there were two concrete instances

17

of an arguable abuse, and of course --

QUESTION:

Did this report, Mr. O'Duden,

19

consider simply appearances as well as speeches or

articles?

It apparently considered all kinds of outside activities.

what you call a nexus is that it's a different problem

7

That is one

A quite separate problem is the problem of the

employee getting paid by someone outside the Government

9

for talking about, you know, really for the benefit that

10

he could do to somebody outside the Government but

11

disguising it under, you know, a speech or whatever.

12

usually disguised under a speech, is what the Government

13

says, and therefore Congress chose to address that.

It's

It's easier to spot what the

argument, it is suggesting that the added volume of

8

material somehow makes it easier to determine a nexus, and

9

I think as Justice Ginsburg noted earlier, that, I think,

10

lacks a rational basis, because someone could easily write

11

a very long, very voluminous, single article with ample

material in it.

MR. O'DUDEN:

2

QUESTION:

3

I beg your pardon, Your Honor?

Which statute is the more defensible

from the Government's standpoint?
MR. O'DUDEN:

4

I think that they were -- they are

5

equally indefensible, but I think that the fact that there

6

is this exception now for a series, that that raises a

7

question about the credibility for limiting payment in the

8

first instance.

9

QUESTION:

Would you say a statute with that

10

qualification, the series nexus test just extended across

11

the board, that such a statute would be constitutional?
MR. O'DUDEN:

12

We have never questioned that if

13

there was a nexus requirement in the statute that applied

14

across the board, that that would be a constitutional

15

statute.
QUESTION:

16

So then you would have no objection

17

to the solution that Judge Silberman proposed in the D.C.

18

Circuit.

19

MR. O'DUDEN:

Quite frankly, Your Honor, as a

20

practical matter, no, we would have no objection to that

21

whatsoever.

22

QUESTION:

Why is that statute constitutional?

23

I mean, there are a lot of times that people could

24

write -- you know, the knowledge that they bear after

25

30 years of work in the Government relates to one field.

They want to write an article about that one field.

2

shouldn't they be able to write that article?

risk?
MR. O'DUDEN:

4

Why

What's the

Well, I think the way the nexus

5

test works, the one that is written in the statute, is

6

that you are not allowed to be paid if there is a direct

7

nexus, so there may well be that there are circumstances

8

where, if somebody is writing generally about something

9

that he has worked on, where it might be appropriate for

10

that person to engage in that kind of activity.
But I think the obvious concern is that if

11
12

you're writing about something that you learned about as a

13

result of your Government position, then that does, at

14

least arguably, create the appearance that you are trading

15

on your job, and therefore we believe that a nexus test is

16

an appropriate test for Congress to have written into the

17

statute.

analogy to the Simon & Schuster case, the Son of Sam

in this case is that the Court has recognized that a law

that imposes a financial disincentive like the honoraria

If Your Honor is asking me what is the standard

goes beyond what is reasonably necessary to secure the

essentially that which is found in Brown v. Glines, and

the court of appeals -- the court of appeals recognized

21

that the starting point with respect to the proper

I believe that there is a

difference between the approach the Court used in

Mitchell, which is similar to a rational basis test, and

18

what it has come to apply.

19

I think that as the Court pointed out in

Connick, the Mitchell case, the rationale was grounded on

the notion that public employees could be required to

illustrate a circumstance where there was a good reason

for a prophylactic measure in that case, because as the

to apply a higher standard of scrutiny than it has applied

in cases like Connick.

11

only thing that I'm trying to accomplish here is to assure

12

the Court that we're not asking for the Court to apply a

13

strict scrutiny test in every Government employee case.

14

We're not suggesting that.

The

But this Court has indicated, and I think maybe

15

this is the point of Your Honor's question, where the

Government employee is speaking on something where there's

17

essentially really no connection to his job, where he's

18

writing an article about dance, or about music, then, as

19

this Court pointed out in Pickering, he is to be treated

as a member of the general public, and in that situation,

describes the class?

reference it refers to laws that were in place before the

of appeals opinion points out, before the statute was in

18

pursuant to Government-wide regulation that could not be

violated if an employee wanted to write or to speak for

MR. O'DUDEN:

Well, in many situations, and this

is typical, we think, of everybody at the IRS, for

9

example, and this point is made in our brief and it's also

10

illustrated in the Joint Appendix, people who work at many

11

Federal agencies, before they can engage in any outside

12

activity, they have to get approval, prior approval from

13

their agency, so what someone would do is to say, I'm

14

intending to write an article about music or dance, and

15

the ethics agency, the officer would review that and make

16

sure that there was no ethics problem, and then that

activity would be approved.

the people that was involved - - were inviting the

21

MR. O'DUDEN:

that deep, but what he would do is to look at whether the

MR. O'DUDEN:

The Wilkey Commission report

2

recommended a ban on honoraria with respect to all three

3

branches of Government, but I think that any analysis of

4

the Wilkey Commission report has to begin with the

5

definition that it had of honoraria.

6

If you look at that report, you'll see that

7

honoraria was defined to refer to compensation that was

8

received for the giving of speeches and, of course, the
Wilkey Commission report drew on the quadrennial

10

Commission report which emphasized that the focus was on

11

situations where people were giving talks for money before

12

special interest groups.

13

The Wilkey Commission report actually points out

14

that it did not intend, by the way, to bar compensation

15

where people were engaged in the writing of scholarly

16

articles, and so our point is that when you look at the

17

definition of the Wilkey Commission report of honoraria,

18

when you look at what it said about the writing of

1

articles, there's simply no foundation there on which the

20

Government can build a reasonable case that this law does

21

not go farther than reasonably necessary.

Well, the legislation says that

you can be reimbursed for travel expenses for yourself and

8

for one relative and, of course, as a practical matter, I

9

think that that underscores once again that this is a very

10

odd law, at least with respect to career employees,

11

because I think in the real world, career employees are

12

not the beneficiaries of that kind of exclusion.

QUESTION:

Well, Congress obviously just didn't

The statute says that.

MR. O'DUDEN:

Of course it does, but I - - we

You mentioned that there were two,

MR. O'DUDEN:

There were problems with respect

to speeches, Your Honor, that's right.
QUESTION:

That's right, so there seem to be

more instances, and I know from my own limited experience

15

in the executive branch that there were more instances of

sorts of things -- as opposed to speeches.

18

MR. O'DUDEN:

QUESTION:

That's right.

So it would seem to me that the

Government would have a stronger case for banning

moonlighting than it does for speeches at the civil

servant level.

MR. O'DUDEN:

Arguably.

I don't want to suggest

that the GAO report concluded that there was a

course, what we have here is not a statute that is a ban

2

on moonlighting, it is a law that singles out only speech

activities and I think, as this Court's precedent makes

4

quite clear, when a law singles out speech activities,

5

that, by definition, makes it suspect.

Unless there are further questions - -

QUESTION:

8

Would it have the -- would you have a

First Amendment problem with a total ban on moonlighting?

9

MR. O'DUDEN:

I think that would be a difficult

10

argument to make, because the Court's decisions indicate

11

that laws of general applicability do not lend themselves,

12

at least not very readily, to a First Amendment challenge.

13

QUESTION:

And you -- but it would have no less

14

of an effect on speech, on honorariums, than the current

law?

16

MR. O'DUDEN:

The problem, again, is that a law

like that would not be singling out speech.

the Court has - -

MR. O'DUDEN:

So is there a different impact?
No, there is no different impact.

So the Government can solve its First

Amendment problem simply by banning all moonlighting.

12

MR. O'DUDEN:

Perhaps.

13

I think that there is some suggestion, maybe,

14

from this Court's earlier precedent, the Murdock case,

15

that you might be able to make a First Amendment

16

challenge, but again, this Court has treated in a special

17

way statutes that single out speech activities.

18

We've seen it do so in cases like Minneapolis

19

Star and, of course, the Arkansas Writers Project, so it

20

is no defense for the Government to say that it could pass

21

a moonlighting statute, because that is not what it has

done here.

With regard to the commission

paragraph from both of the commission reports, which says

that honoraria should be defined so as to close present
