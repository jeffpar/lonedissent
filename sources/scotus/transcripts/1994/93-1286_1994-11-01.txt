ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE J. ENNIS, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. ENNIS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The Airline Deregulation Act categorically

12

preempts any State law relating to airline rates, routes,

13

and services.

14

change the rate for purchasing tickets through its

15

frequent flyer program.

16

decision on State law grounds.

17

overrides American's express reservation of the right to

18

change frequent flyer rules and awards at any time, and

19

gives respondents a right to purchase tickets at the rate

20

in effect before the change.

21

In 1988, American Airlines decided to

Respondents challenged that
They claim State law

In Morales, this Court ruled that the ADA

22

broadly preempts State laws whose enforcement would have a

23

connection with rates, routes, or services.

25

law claims.

That test

direct impact on American's rates because it would require

2

American to rescind its system-wide rate decision or pay

3

substantial damages.

4

QUESTION:

What about a negligence claim arising

5

out of a plane crash, Mr. Ennis?

6

mean, if American, for example, wasn't held liable for

7

negligence in plane crashes it certainly would affect its

8

rates, probably affect its way of flying, too.

9

MR. ENNIS:

That certainly -- I

Your Honor, in Morales this Court

10

ruled that not every claim that literally relates to

11

rates, routes, and services is preempted.

12

will have too tenuous an effect.

13

kinds of safety claims would generally not be preempted.

14

There are also indications in the text of the ADA and in

15

the structure of the ADA that - -

QUESTION:

Some claims

We believe that those

-- accidents can have a very powerful

effect on service, can they not?
MR. ENNIS:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, the Morales

19

test stands for two propositions.

20

preempted if the claims assert a direct right to a

21

particular rate, route, or service, and those kinds of

22

safety claims would not.

23

First, claims are

The claims in this case would.

Second, under the tenuousness exception of

24

Morales, claims that would have an indirect effect on

25

rates, routes, and services are preempted, but not if

1

they're too tenuous.
In our view, the way to understand that is to

2

3

say that claims will generally be preempted if their

4

indirect effect will have a significant impact on

5

competitive decision-making regarding rates, routes, or

6

services.

7

If they are not likely to have a significant

8

effect on competitive decision-making, then they are

9

probably going to be too tenuous to warrant preemption.

10

That test, impact on competitive decision-making, is

11

consistent with both the text of the ADA and the

12

legislative purpose, which was to place maximum reliance

13

on competitive decision-making on market forces.

14
15

QUESTION:

It certainly wasn't mentioned in - -

that test certainly wasn't mentioned in Morales, was it?

16

MR. ENNIS:

Your Honor, the actual formulation

17

of the test in Morales was not mentioned.

18

said that claims will not be preempted if their effect on

19

rates, toutes, and services is too tenuous or peripheral.

20

We have attempted to formulate, to flesh out a test that

21

gives meaning to the tenuousness exception in Morales that

22

is consistent with the text and with the legislative

23

history, and in our view, that test, impact on competitive

24

decision-making, would not generally preempt most safety

25

claims.

Morales simply

QUESTION:

1

What if a potential passenger has a

2

ticket and a reservation that says, that guarantees him --

3

I know airlines don't do it, but supposing we have an

4

oddball airline that does, guarantees him passage on the

5

4:00 p.m. flight from Chicago to Washington, and he gets

6

there, and he's just told, well, we've sold the place to

7

somebody else.

8

simply wants to sue the airline for damages.

9

to an important meeting.

10

He gets there in plenty of time.

So he

He was going

He might have made some money.

Is that preempted?
MR. ENNIS:

11

Generally, Your Honor, those kinds

12

of denied boarding claims will be preempted, because most

13

of those claims will assert a direct right to a particular

14

rate, route, or service.

15

in any way.

16

They can't be considered tenuous

However, preemption of those claims will not

17

leave passengers without a remedy, and will not create a

18

major administrative burden for the DOT, because the DOT

19

has already issued regulations governing denied boarding

20

claims.

21
22

23

QUESTION:

What does a person do, go over and

stand in line at the Department of Transportation?
MR. ENNIS:

What the person does is, that person

24

would have the same remedies that this Court found

25

sufficient in Morales for the claims that were preempted

there.

QUESTION:

3

MR. ENNIS:

What does he do, though?
Well, he can file a -- first attempt

4

to negotiate informally with the airlines, which works in

5

the vast majority of cases, and second can file a

6

complaint with the Department of Transportation.

7

Department has ample authority to redress any of those --

The

QUESTION:

Has it redressed any so far?

10

MR. ENNIS:

Yes, they have, Your Honor.

11

have addressed many.

12

issue in this case have actually been considered by the

13

Department of Transportation, which entertained those

14

claims but denied them on the merits.

15
16
17

In fact, the very claims that are in

Section 1381 gives the Department of
Transportation -QUESTION:

Mr. Ennis, can you tell us what else

18

would be left out?

19

How about lost baggage?

20

They

MR. ENNIS:

You said overbooking is preempted.

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I have to

21

answer that in two ways.

22

involving luggage would not be preempted under our test,

23

but some would.

24
25

I think that most claims

Let me explain.

If the claim challenges the liability limit that
the airline has set for lost luggage claims, that claim

1

would be preempted, because enforcement of that claim

2

would have a significant impact on the airline's

3

competitive decision regarding what the appropriate

4

maximum limit should be, and that's consistent with DOT

5

regulations which permit airlines to set maximum limits

6

for luggage liability, so enforcement of that claim would

7

impede Federal objectives and have a direct impact.

8

But if all we're talking about is the value of a

9

particular piece of luggage within that limit, those kinds

10

of claims generally would not be preempted, because they

11

would not assert a right to a particular rate, route, or

12

service directly, and their indirect connection would be

13

tenuous.

14

competitive decisions regarding the appropriate liability

15

limit just because a State court decides a bag is worth

16

$300 instead of $200.

17

Airlines are not going to change their

QUESTION:

Mr. Ennis, is it your position that

18

any subject or question or issue that's within the

19

competehce and the jurisdiction of the DOT is preempted?

20

MR. ENNIS:

Your Honor, let me try to answer the

21

question this way.

22

position is that the -- section 1305, the express

23

preemption provision, is an express preemption provision,

24

and the purpose of an express preemption provision is to

25

preempt all laws within the sphere of laws whose

That's not exactly our position.

8

(800) FOR DEPO

Our

1

enforcement might interfere with Federal objectives.
This is not actual conflict preemption, this is

2

3

an express preemption clause, so generally speaking, the

4

answer is yes, that if it would be within the competence

5

of the DOT to regulate, it could be preempted, but our

6

test is not exactly the same.

7

QUESTION:

But the DOT'S jurisdiction is not

8

phrased in terms of rates, routes, and services, is it, or

9

is it?

10

MR. ENNIS:

No.

In fact, the whole point of the

11

Airline Deregulation Act was to deregulate the authority

12

that the CAB, now the DOT, had over the economic aspects

13

of air transportation, rates, routes, and services.

14

QUESTION:

Yes, I understand, but you have been

15

saying that certain matters can be heard by the DOT, and

16

I'm just asking myself whether or not there is room for

17

some concurrent jurisdiction.

18

MR. ENNIS:

Your Honor, I think there might be

19

room for concurrent jurisdiction for all those types of

20

claims, such as the value of lost luggage claims, that

21

would not impact competitive decision-making.

22

could certainly come in and, by rule, prescribe a uniform

23

rule for even those kinds of evaluation claims which would

24

not, in our view, be preempted by section 1305 itself.

In fact --

Well, isn't deregulation more about

freeing airlines from intrusive Government oversight than

8

it was concerned about requiring airlines to keep their

MR. ENNIS:

10

Well, Justice O'Connor, the

11

deregulation act really had, and the Government

12

acknowledges this, three distinct purposes.

13

simply deregulation, get State governments off the

14

airlines' backs with respect to rates, routes, and

services.

20

still retains, to exercise that authority always with a

making .

23

QUESTION:

Well, could the DOT promulgate a

24

regulation saying that claims of this type should proceed

25

in State court?

1

MR. ENNIS:

Your Honor, that would be a very-

2

difficult question about whether that kind of regulation

3

would be so inconsistent with the statute that it would be

4

beyond the DOT'S power.

5

valuation claims, I don't see any problem with that,

6

because I don't think those would be preempted.

7

I think for claims such as

For claims that would assert direct right to a

8

rate, route, or service, I think it would be inconsistent

9

with the statutory test for the DOT to say, those claims

10

which are clearly preempted by the text of the statute can

11

nevertheless proceed in State court.

12

QUESTION:

What about a - - if the airline sells

13

a passenger, a prospective passenger a ticket at a certain

14

rate and the passenger goes to the gate on the day of the

15

flight and is told, well, we just upped the rates, and it

16

will be $100 more?

17

passenger would have no State court lawsuit for that.

18

MR. ENNIS:

I guess under your theory the

That's correct, Justice O'Connor.

19

That's very similar to the question Justice -- Chief

20

Justice Rehnquist asked, and our answer would be the same.

21

For all of those denied boarding kinds of

22

claims, the passenger is asserting a direct right to a

23

particular rate, route, or service.

24

tenuously connected with rates, routes, and services.

25

Those clearly are not

1

would have thought, central to your claim to be able to

2

compete, because you cannot compete effectively unless the

3

offers that you make are offers that your customers or

4

prospective customers can depend on, so that if the

5

customer cannot enforce the contract which he thinks he

6

makes with you, which is the essence of your competitive

7

activity, then that is, in fact, a direct threat to the

8

very competition which the act is supposed to foster.

9

MR. ENNIS:

Justice Souter, we are not taking

10

the position that those kinds of contract claims cannot be

11

enforced.

We are simply taking the position -QUESTION:

12

13

They can only be enforced in the

administrative Federal forum, you said.

QUESTION:

And is DOT enforcing contracts of

enforced contracts like that, Your Honor.
â€¢

QUESTION:

Yes, they have.

Why does it -- and given the fact

20

that the enforcement of those contracts is, I would

21

suppose, central to your capacity to compete, why,

22

nonetheless, is that, and even the existence of the

23

Federal forum, an argument for preemption?

24

that the Feds may indeed want to enforce them if there

25

were an insufficient State mechanism to do it, but why

It seems to me

1

does preemption follow from a threat to your competitive

2

position?
MR. ENNIS:

3

Let me try to answer the question

4

this way, Justice Souter.

American that respondent's statutory claim for damages is

preempted because of its impact.

MR. ENNIS:

MR. ENNIS:

The United States agrees with

-- is preempted because of its

impact on American's rates, routes, and services.

13

QUESTION:

And -- but the reasoning there, as I

14

understand it, is that there is room under that statute

for something more than a straightforward enforcement of

the bargain.

State forum, whereas under a straight contract claim there

18

is not.

19

There is room for policy choices in the

Is that roughly correct?
MR. ENNIS:

That's essentially the Government's

20

position, Your Honor, but there are two things to be said

21

about that.

22

if Congress wanted to preempt the statutory claim because

23

of its impact on American's rates, why would Congress not

24

want to preempt the contract claim which challenges the

25

same decision for the same reason, seeks the same relief,

2

and would have the same impact?
QUESTION:

Because in one case the parties are

3

the regulators, in the other case the Government is.

4

thing is Government imposition of requirements which could

5

be inconsistent with Federal requirements.

6

as the Government puts it, giving effect to private

7

ordering, to the parties' own bargain.

8

9

MR. ENNIS:

One

The other is,

Justice Ginsburg, this case doesn't

raise that hard question about express promises that the

10

airline simply refuses to perform, because in this case it

11

is undisputed that American expressly reserved the right

12

to change frequent flyer rules and awards at any time.

13

QUESTION:

But that simply means that, if you're

14

correct, you may win the case if it is litigated in State

15

court, but it doesn't have anything to do with preemption.

16

MR. ENNIS:

It has a great deal to do with

17

preemption, Justice Souter, for the following reason.

18

our view, it is certain that the plaintiffs cannot prevail

19

unless,'under State law norms and policies, that express

20

reservation clause is limited or invalidated, either on

21

the ground that it gave inadequate notice --

22

QUESTION:

Why?

In

Why isn't it simply a question

23

of interpreting what the clause means?

24

that all that that clause means is that any time from that

25

day forward the airline can change, but it can't do it

One might argue

2

invalidating the clause in advance.

3

could very well be characterized as simply construing the

4

clause that the parties agreed to.

5

MR. ENNIS:

You characterize that as
It seems to me it

Justice Ginsburg, in our view the

6

only fair way to read that reservation of rights is that

7

it applies across the board.
But to answer your question, even if it could

8

9

conceivably be interpreted differently, there is at least

10

a palpable risk that State law norms and policies will

11

come into play in construing and applying that express

12

reservation clause, and when you're dealing with a case of

13

express preemption, we don't have to show an actual

14

conflict.

15

interference with Federal objectives.

16

We only have to show that there's a risk of

QUESTION:

Here the risk is --

But aren't you in effect simply

17

saying that the risk of interference comes from the fact

18
19

that, in construing the parties' bargain, the State court
Â»
might get it wrong in your viewpoint.
It's kind of the

20

mirror image of your argument that there should be no

21

preemption because you are destined to win.

22

MR. ENNIS:

Your Honor, unfortunately we are not

23

destined to win, because if you'll look at the opinion of

24

the Illinois supreme court below, all it had before it was

25

a preemption question.

It went out of its way to say that

Basically, the second time around, the Illinois

they will not actually prescribe or dictate particular

squarely held, based on ERISA precedents, that section

preemption analysis for the contract claim.
Petitioner's suggestion that a remedy for breach

MS. PILLARD:

9

The Department has never been

Could it do so under the statute?
In our view, it is not empowered

to adjudicate private rights.

As this Court referred to

10

in the Nader decision, the Department of Transportation's

11

authority is to effectuate public rights, and it has the

12

authority to protect its own regulations in compliance

13

with its statute, but it does not have the authority to

14

adjudicate private contract disputes between private

15

parties.

16

And that's consistent with the deregulation act

17

insofar as what the act aimed to do was to encourage a

18

free market where prices and production were determined

19

precisely by private contract, as opposed to by tariffs or

20

Government decision, and in our view the private market

21

depends on the effectiveness of contract.

22

One of the examples that Mr. Ennis gave was the

23

limits on baggage liability.

limit, and the ability of the airlines to enforce it

contract law.
The act's repeated references to contracts or

2

agreements between private parties we think reflects

4

Congress' assumption that contracts in a usual sense would

5

remain effective.
The preemption clause, by its terms, preempts

6

enforcement of law, not enforcement of contracts.

8

was the position of the Civil Aeronautics Board, which it

9

took contemporaneously with the passage of the Airline

10

That

Deregulation Act, and that's the position we take today.
Our view is supported first by the text and

11
12

structure of the act, including the text of the preemption

13

clause, references elsewhere in the active contracts, the

14

clause saving remedies, and the actions of any provision

for an alternative Federal remedy for breach of contract

16

rights.

QUESTION:

May I ask what you do with the

18

Norfolk and Western case in which they rely on the fact

19

that enforcement of a contract is enforcement of a law?

20

MS. PILLARD:

The -- in Norfolk & Western, the

21

entire function of the statute was quite different from

22

the Airline Deregulation Act.

24

on a case-by-case basis to preempt State law as necessary

25

to allow carriers to consolidate.

There, you had a situation

away obligations, and in that act the Commission has the

obligation to see to the rights of employees, so - - and

5

the Court found that important in construing the language

6

of the statute to allow preemption of a collective

7

bargaining agreement, because clearly that was

8

contemplated in the act in giving the Commission the

9

authority to provide for the rights of employees.

10

Here, you have a situation where the Department

11

does not have a mechanism for providing for the rights of

12

passengers or others dealing with the airlines.

13

the Department's regulations contemplate as an important

14

contract enforcement mechanism that individuals can go to

to, unless he's referring to the petition for a proposed

rulemaking which was filed by the Association of Discount

of the Department's statute, but it expressly, in the

much whether this was a voluntary undertaking of the

carrier, and only if the carrier in fact contracted to be

MR. GORDON:

the Federal deregulatory scheme, but as a general rule, if

13

the type of injunctive relief we are talking about would

QUESTION:

There could be certain

Well, neither are they the

5

enforcement of the bargain, and I thought the essence of

6

your bargain is that what you're asking for is the

enforcement of a bargain, and that is precisely what the

act was supposed to foster, but if you go to punitive

damages you've passed that point.

MR. GORDON:

QUESTION:

We aren't seeking punitive damages.
No, I realize, but doesn't your

argument really force you for consistency's sake to say

13

punitive damages would, in fact, be preempted?

14

MR. GORDON:

Well, only to the extent that

15

punitive damages, Justice Souter, would have a direct

16

impact on the deregulatory scheme, which they often would,

17

and in those instances they would be preempted.

18

But there are circumstances -- for example, in

19

tort cases -- where punitive damages would really not

20

impact on the deregulatory scheme and therefore would not

21

be preempted nor regulatory, so I don't think there can be

22

a hard and fast rule that punitive damages would be

It seemed to me that might provide an

Well, Justice Breyer, the DOT'S

7

jurisdiction is, of course, discretionary and

8

nonexclusive, so the DOT can take jurisdiction of the

9

subject matter, and that's an interesting response to why

10

American would not be subjected to unreasonable laws of 50

11

States.
If there were a circumstance where the laws of

12

13

all the States were so diverse as to be unduly burdensome

14

on American, they could go to the Department of

15

Transportation, they could ask for a rule on that subject

16

matter, and that rule would take precedence over the State

17

law.

18

So consequently, I think that the Department of

19

Transportation's jurisdiction coexists, except to the

20

extent that there is no authority in the Department of

21

Transportation to award compensatory damages for breach of

How would it work?
MR. GORDON:

Well, I think that the case should

just be affirmed, it would go back to the trial court, and

6

if, on appeal again, there were some imposition of State

7

law that the DOT or American Airlines felt related to

8

rates, routes, or services, some State theory, then they

9

would have that ground for appeal at another time.

10

We're at the pleading stage here.

Sending it

11

back now to examine that issue, the Illinois court would

12

only look at the same complaint that this Court looks at,

13

but if it were to go back up through the system, yes, they

would have the right to appeal preemption issues if the

of State theory can be preempted.

scenario to enforce breach of contract claims they would

The DOT would have no jurisdiction

First, there is no textual basis for the

Government's unworkable distinction between normative and

12

limiting preemption to State-imposed norms or policies is

13

very much like limiting preemption to State-imposed
