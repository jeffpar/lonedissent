ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE A. KATZ

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. KATZ:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:

11

This case involves a very narrow issue:

12

the Port Authority, a Compact Clause entity, and PATH, its

13

subsidiary, are entitled to the protection of the Eleventh

14

Amendment.

15

whether

This Court, in its Lake Country decision,

16

instructed that Compact Clause entities are not

17

automatically entitled to the protection of the Eleventh

18

Amendment.

19

QUESTION:

Why does one follow from the other?

20

Is it necessarily so that if PATH has immunity -- well, is

21

it necessary to sort of -- if the Port Authority has

22

immunity that PATH does?

23

subsidiary, as it's described.

24
25

MR. KATZ:

PATH is a wholly owned

The statute creating PATH gives it

all the rights and immunities of the Port Authority.

We

1
2

believe that
QUESTION:

But if a State created a corporation

3

and gave it all the immunities of the State, it wouldn't

4

necessarily follow that it would have immunity as a matter

5

of Federal law.

That would still be for us to determine.

6

MR. KATZ:

That's correct, Your Honor.

7

QUESTION:

So I'm not -- so nothing turns, in

8

your view, on the fact that this is a wholly-owned

9

subsidiary of the Port Authority?

1

MR. KATZ:

We believe that there is certainly a

11

connection between the Port Authority and PATH that would

12

in all probability permit this Court to find that if the

13

Port Authority is entitled to the Eleventh Amendment

14

immunity, it is likely that PATH is similarly, because

15

their structure is very similar.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Then that's the analysis that we have

to follow here, isn't it?
MR. KATZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

We don't believe,

19

though, that the Port Authority is entitled to the

2

Eleventh Amendment immunity.

21

QUESTION:

But in any case, the terms of the

22

corporate charter have nothing to do with our inquiry

23

except insofar as it identifies the powers of the

24

corporation and allows us to determine whether the

25

corporation is equivalent to the Authority, and hence

1

whether the Authority is equivalent to the State.

2

MR. KATZ:

That's correct.

There's a step

3

procedure that must be followed.

4

whether or not PATH is the functional equivalent of the

5

Port Authority, and then the constitutional issue, whether

6

the Port Authority is then the functional equivalent of

7

the State.

13

We must first see

Technically -QUESTION:

But you don't think anything turns on

that first inquiry, as I understand your brief.

You treat

PATH just as if it were the Port Authority.
MR. KATZ:

We do, because by statute it is

considered the same.
QUESTION:

But if it is the same, it's not

14

because its charter says it's the same, it's because under

15

straight Eleventh Amendment analysis it is the same.

16

Nothing is added by their saying, this is the same, any

17

more than anything is added to the analysis by the Port

18

Authority's enabling act saying this is the State.

19

MR. KATZ:

The only thing that at all is added

20

is the fact that the discussion relating to the Port

21

Authority in several instances will also apply to PATH

22

because the same Compact is used in creating the rights

23

and regulations with regard to both under State law.

24

QUESTION:

Yes.

25

QUESTION:

Well, it may work one way and not the

1

other way.

That is to say, if the Port Authority is not

2

entitled to sovereign immunity, surely PATH is not, but if

3

the Port Authority is, perhaps PATH is and perhaps it

4

isn't.

Would you agree with that?
MR. KATZ:

5

Justice Scalia, I would agree with

6

that.

I believe that PATH, because of the nature, acting

7

for all intents and purposes as a private business owned

8

by State entities, could be found to not possess Eleventh

9

Amendment protection, where, if the Court was so inclined,

10

the Port Authority could be found to possess that

11

protection.

12

We do not believe that is the case, though.

We

13

believe that this case is controlled by the Lake Country

14

decision, and the importance of Lake Country, as we view

15

it, is the fact that this Court held that bi-State Compact

16

Clause entities are not automatically entitled to the

17

protection of the Eleventh Amendment, and that with

18

respect to these Compact Clause entities, the limited

19

language of the Eleventh Amendment is not to be

20

expansively applied.

21

Now, with both regard to the Port Authority and

22

PATH, it is clear, first of all, that neither is a State,

23

it is also equally as clear that neither is controlled by

24

any individual sovereign State and, finally, it is clear

25

that neither is the functional equivalent of any

MR. KATZ:

A State or the functional equivalent

of a State --

Right.

MR. KATZ:

-- that would show the relationship

11

between them.

I believe --

require its action.

That's critical --

17

QUESTION:

What about an international

18

organization like OPEC, for example, an international

19

organization of sovereigns to operate in one particular

20

field, or what about something like a joint command of a

21

military operation like a crusade in Europe, I mean, the

22

unified forces?

23

MR. KATZ:

Justice Scalia, I would have to know

24

how those international agencies are structured.

25

they're structured similar to the Port Authority, where

If

1

neither State on its own can compel the Port Authority to

2

act, then I would say that under an analogous situation

3

the same result should apply as --

4

QUESTION:

Really?

-- we seek here.

QUESTION:

You think OPEC is suable in American

MR. KATZ:

Well, no, I don't think that OPEC is

covered by the Eleventh Amendment at all.

The Eleventh

Amendment does not apply.
QUESTION:

11

Well, I'm talking about sovereign

12

immunity in the international sense, which has a lot of

13

bearing upon what sovereign immunity in the Eleventh

14

Amendment is.

15

MR. KATZ:

Your Honor, I must be --

16

QUESTION:

You see, I've always thought that an

17

organization like OPEC surely is not suable.

18

MR. KATZ:

Your Honor, I would have to plead

19

ignorance to OPEC, because I'm not certain as to their

20

structure.

21

direct relationship between any individual member, any

22

individual nation, and OPEC --

23

If they are structured so that there is a

QUESTION:

No individual nation can control it.

24

Just as in a joint military operation no individual State

25

can control it.

It has to have the consent of all.

MR. KATZ:

1

If the consent of all the States are

2

necessary, then using an Eleventh Amendment analysis, I

3

would contend that OPEC is not protected by the Eleventh

4

Amendment or the analogous international law.

What's very important to --

QUESTION:

I think you're wrong, but --

QUESTION:

Mr. Katz, am I wrong in thinking that

8

you are relying dominantly on, this is an entity that

raises its own money and pays its own way?

I thought that

10

that's what -- you were emphasizing that and not the

11

business of who controls, or how is the control spread.

case.

1

QUESTION:

It seems to me that those standard

2

conceptions of sovereign immunity extend to two sovereigns

3

acting jointly just as they extend to a single sovereign.

4

MR. KATZ:

By entering into this Federal system,

5

Your Honors, the Founding States and all subsequent States

6

have as part of the plan to the Convention, as part of the

7

Compact Clause, changed their role with respect to

8

interstate Compact entities.

9

The reason for that is that sovereign States, on

10

their own -- sovereign colonies before this Constitution

11

was enacted -- had the ability to create entities, had the

12

ability to form coalitions.

13

they approved the Compact Clause, and today, a

14

sovereign -- today, a State does not have the sovereign

15

power to create a Compact Clause entity without the

16

approval of the Congress.

17

QUESTION:

When they joined the Union,

That's true, but why does that lead

18

to the conclusion -- that says they cannot act jointly

19

without the approval of Congress, but why does it follow

20

from that that when --

21

saying, when they do act jointly, they no longer have

22

sovereign immunity the way they used to?

23

that follows.

24
25

MR. KATZ:

moreover, which is what you're

I don't see how

They don't have sovereign immunity

any longer because the practical day-to-day realities of

1

bi-State Compact entities is that the States cannot

2

exercise their sovereign control over the entity.
QUESTION:

3

Well, are you saying as a matter of

4

law if there's a bi-State entity it does not have Eleventh

5

Amendment immunity?

6

MR. KATZ:

No, Your -- Mr. Chief Justice,

I am

not saying that.

8

entity, structured as the Port Authority is structured,

9

does not have the ability to claim the Eleventh Amendment.

10

What I am saying is that a bi-State

It is possible -QUESTION:

11

You would apply no different test to

12

a bi-State entity than to a single State entity, then.

13

that --

14

MR. KATZ:

No, on the contrary.

Is

I believe that

15

the burden that a bi-State entity has to show in order to

16

establish that it's entitled to the protection of the

17

Eleventh Amendment is stronger because of its unique role

18

in our constitutional system.

19

not only the cooperation of the other States, but the

20

concurrence of Congress.

21

QUESTION:

Bi-State entities require

I believe there's --

Well, in the Lake Country Estates

22

there's certainly no suggestion, as I read the opinion,

23

that the analysis is different because it's a bi-State

24

entity rather than a single-State entity.

25

MR. KATZ:

I believe implicit in Lake Country is

1

the underlying factor that this is a Compact Clause

2

entity, and for that reason, the Court was not willing to

3

extend the Eleventh Amendment protection any further than

4

it did.
QUESTION:

5

Well, the reason -- I thought you had

6

just said your main argument doesn't have to do with who

7

controls, or it's bi-State, but it has to do with how this

8

organiz -- what it's operation is, how it pays for that

9

operation.

10
11
12

13

That would be the same if it were one State or

two States, right?
MR. KATZ:

That would be correct, but I believe

the burden of proof is stronger with a multi-State entity.
Justice Ginsburg, responding to the question

14

that you asked earlier, we believe that the Treasury

15

factors are the most important factor to look at, and the

16

reason it's the most important factor is that in Lake

17

Country this Court explained that the reason that some

18

entities who are not the State itself are entitled to the

19

protection of the Eleventh Amendment is in order to

20

protect the State Treasury.

21

The rationale for the extension from State to

22

entity was given in Justice Stevens' opinion as the

23

protection of State Treasuries.

24
25

In an Eleventh Amendment case, it's important to
recognize that there's a two-step process involved.

The

1

first step is whether or not the entity is entitled to the

2

Eleventh Amendment.

3

not the Eleventh Amendment applies in light of issues such

4

as abrogation and waiver.

5

The second step is then whether or

In that first step, Lake Country and other

6

decisions of this Court emphasized the Treasury factor,

7

and in this case, the Treasury factor is fully supportive

8

of the proposition that the Eleventh Amendment does not

9

apply to the Port Authority and PATH.

10

QUESTION:

Well, I tried to ask you about

11

whether the States would receive any surplus revenues, and

12

you never really answered the question.

You went off --

13

MR. KATZ:

I apologize.

14

QUESTION:

-- in a different direction.

15

MR. KATZ:

The answer to that question --

16

QUESTION:

Now, it is possible that the States

17

may receive surplus revenues under this scheme?

18

MR. KATZ:

It is possible.

19

QUESTION:

And have there ever been years in

20
21

which there were such revenues that the States shared?
MR. KATZ:

In response to the first question,

22

yes, it is possible for the States, by cooperative

23

decision of the legislatures and their Governors, to share

24

the general revenue fund.

25

that has been done, and I believe that the Port Authority

has cited some of those situations in their brief.
By the same token, there are other examples

2
3

where an individual State, seeking to pursue what it

4

believed was its sovereign policy, wanted to take that

5

money, and they weren't permitted to because the agreement

6

of the other State was not available.

It is that situation, the practical realities

QUESTION:

Well, just tell me.

2

MR. KATZ:

My position is that any entity

3

structured as the Port Authority is structured is not

4

entitled to the protection of the Eleventh Amendment.

5

believe that the States and Congress concurring could

6

create a statutory framework where each State has the

7

opportunity to either exercise some control or dip into

8

the funds themselves, where there is significant authority

exercised by the States and, if that structure did exist,

those entities would be entitled to the Eleventh Amendment

2

the Port Authority says today, let's look at what they

did.

4

In this case, we had that situation.

We have a

5

situation where the Attorney General of New York went into

6

court to compel the Port Authority to stop polluting the

water around the Kennedy Airport.

8

that injunction hearing noted that it was in fact unusual

that the Port Authority, being a quasi-State agency of

The judge who heard

because we don't know that it's our pollution that's

13

causing the damage.

Now, the Port Authority in their reply brief

indicates that the presence of this lawsuit is actually

That all reduces back down to your

basic argument that you have no sovereign unless you are

within the control of two sovereign States suddenly

11

eliminates sovereign immunity.

12

MR. KATZ:

The reason that eliminates sovereign

13

immunity unless the statutory structure gives those

14

individual States some independent control is because the

15

purpose of extending sovereign immunity is because the

16

agency is derivative of the sovereign.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HUGH H. WELSH

20

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

21

22
23

MR. WELSH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
For more than 30 years, the Port Authority of

24

New York and New Jersey shared the sovereign immunity of

25

the two States that created it, and it was not until 1951
25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

that the two States passed legislation that permitted

2

suits against the Port Authority in the first place.

3

This Court has found that that conditional

4

waiver of the sovereign immunity also contained language

5

that constituted a conditional waiver of the Eleventh

6

Amendment, and so when this case was filed beyond the

7

1 year within which such suits may be bought, it was only

8

logical, then, for the District of New Jersey and later

9

the Third Circuit to dismiss the case because of the lack

10

of jurisdiction of the Federal court, because the Eleventh

11

Amendment would bar this action being bought against an

12

arm of the State in the Federal courts.
The Court over the years has considered many

13
14

factors to determine whether a State agency is in fact an

15

arm of the State entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity,

16

and I suggest to you that if one takes a look at the Port

17

Authority of New York and New Jersey and its subsidiary,

18

PATH, it's quite clear that it does share the indicia, or

19

the criteria, that the Court has applied in a number of

20

cases.

21

If you take all of the indicia, all of the

22

criteria that have been considered over the years, you'll

23

find that they really come down to two fundamental

24

questions, and one is, did the States create an agency

25

that was an arm of the State and entitled to share in the
26

1

immunity, and secondly, did they continue to exercise

2

control over that agency and, in both cases, that is the

3

case of the Port Authority.
So if we apply the indicia from Lake Country

4
5

Estates or from the Mount Healthy decision, both decisions

6

of this Court, I think it's quite clear that the Port

7

Authority does share that immunity.
A number of questions were asked relating to the

8

9

State Treasury test.

Justice O'Connor asked about the

10

limit of $100,000 on the State's obligation to the Port

11

Authority.

12

an obligation at the time the Port Authority was created

13

for each State to commit up to $100,000 each until such

14

time as the Port Authority became self-supporting.

15

I believe what we were referring to there was

There were other times in its history that the

16

Port Authority was supported by the States of New York and

17

New Jersey.

18

defaulting on the bonds, the two States actually gave to

19

the Port Authority the operation and control over the

20

Holland Tunnel, and the revenues from that facility, which

21

was built by the two States, helped to support the Port

22

Authority, and then, since then, the Port Authority has

23

been self-supporting.

24
25

In its early days when there was a danger of

looked at over the years, but even if one focuses on that

2

with regard to the Port Authority, it's quite clear that

3

the Port Authority is very closely linked to the

4

Treasuries of both of the States that created it.
It's true that the Port Authority may not pledge

5
6

the credit of either the State of New York or New Jersey.

7

It's also true that a judgment against PATH or the Port

8

Authority will not be paid for directly out of the State

9

Treasury of either State.
QUESTION:

10

May I ask a background question?

11

mentioned that between 1922, or whenever it was they

12

formed this, and 1951, they retained their sovereign

13

immunity?

14

MR. WELSH:

Yes.

There's a series of cases that

15

came down during that period of time that made it quite

16

clear that the Port Authority shared the sovereign

17

immunity of the two States until 1951.

18

York and New Jersey cases, were they?

20

MR. WELSH:

negligence of the Port Authority do during that period?

that were passed, much like many States used to deal with

claims against --

MR. WELSH:

Resolutions passed by whom?

5

Port Authority resolving the cases and providing for

QUESTION:

8

MR. WELSH:

9

I see.

I see.

And it's my understanding that a

number of cases before they waived -- a number of States

10

before they waived sovereign immunity would deal with

11

claims in a similar manner, until they created court of

12

claims or decided to waive it through some tort claims

13

act.

14

But if one looks at the Port Authority and the

15

history of the relationship between the two -- the Port

16

Authority and the two States that created it, it's quite

17

evident that there is a very close link financially

18

between the States and the Port Authority.

19

Authority is somewhat unique for State agencies, because

20

the Port Authority is essentially lending its support to

21

the States that created it, so any judgment against the

Port Authority is an impact on the State fisc.

But how would that be different from

prime.

7

It seems that those later

That is, is this entity making its own money.
MR. WELSH:

In Bolden and other Third Circuit

8

cases, the Third Circuit did focus on the fact that the

9

Treasury factor was an important factor, but it made it

10

quite clear it was not the only factor, and they applied a

11

balance of those factors.

12

Interestingly in Bolden --

13

QUESTION:

But they did say, did they not, that

14

it was probably the most important factor, and they

15

distinguished the Third Circuit -- whose decision is

16

before us for review -- distinguished the Port Authority

17

cases on the ground that the States really would come to

18

the rescue of the Port Authority, that the State's credit

19

really did stand behind that entity?

20

MR. WELSH:

That was part of the distinction

21

that was made in Bolden to, I think it was the Southeast

22

Pennsylvania Transit Authority in the Bolden case, that

23

they focused on the fact that the States might step in in

also looked at other factors in Bolden.

In Bolden, the Third Circuit, sitting en banc,

2

considered a continuum with the Port Authority at one end

3

as an example of an agency that was entitled to Eleventh

4

Amendment immunity, and I think at Rutgers University at

5

the other end, and they were trying to determine where on

6

that continuum SPTA fit in, but they didn't rely solely on

7

the Treasury -- argument of the Treasury issue to

8

determine that case.

9

The Port Authority over the years has committed

10

vast resources to the support of the two States that

created it.

12

that was passed by the two States authorizing and

13

directing the Port Authority to undertake various

projects, and we set forth a number of examples in our

brief with citations to the authorizing legislation.

This was done through bi-State legislation

As an example, the Port Authority has committed

$440 million, $220 million to each State, to acquire buses

18

that are being used by the two States for the benefit of

19

their people.

20

requested by the State, and we've committed $106 million

pursuant to legislation to develop the so-called Oak Point

3

The New Jersey supreme court, in a case entitled

that would justify reading additional meaning into the

limited language of the amendment.

Yes.

That's at page 401.

It was nothing in that

QUESTION:

this Compact that justifies a departure from a general

rule that the Eleventh Amendment means what it says.

MR. WELSH:

I believe the general rule should be

that in the absence of language, one should assume that

the Eleventh Amendment does protect the agency if it is an

agency of a nature that would make it an arm of the State

QUESTION:

Mr. Welsh, I thought you were going

to say that we've also had cases subsequent to Lake

You're not urging that that WMATA

case is distinguishable, that it wouldn't be consistent to

9

hold WMATA -- why don't you just tell us what was the

10
11

reason for the holding of immunity in WMATA?
MR. WELSH:

WMATA was -- focused on the control

12

that was being exercised by the creating States over that

13

agency that was created to operate the transit system.

14

Treasury was one of the issues, and I believe WMATA is

15

dependant on both the Federal Government and the States

16

for a certain amount of support, but in addition, there

17

was a focus on the fact that the two States did exercise

18

control over that agency, so --

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. WELSH:

What about who pays?

Who pays?

Well, it was acknowledged there that

21

the judgment would be paid by WMATA, but ultimately it

22

might be borne by the riders or be borne by the two States

23

that are subsidizing it.

24

my point is that they didn't focus solely on the State

25

Treasury test in WMATA.

That was provided in WMATA, but

This is one of the difficulties that the courts

2

around the country and the circuits courts are faced with,

3

and it's the fact that we could have a railroad in one

State that seemingly has the characteristics of a railroad

5

in the other State, and one circuit will hold that there

6

is immunity and the other State will not.

Well, maybe our multifactor test

doesn't work very well.
MR. WELSH:

the multifactor test is usually

14

applied in a determination that the agency does not have

15

the Eleventh Amendment immunity, and yet there hasn't been

16

clear direction given to the courts and to public agencies

17

as to what should be included to make sure that there is

18

Eleventh Amendment immunity, or what we should look for to

determine that an agency is entitled to it.

Country Estates and Mount Healthy.

It's usually

But all of those indicia really come down to two

fundamental issues, and one is the nature of the agency

that was created, and secondly is the elements of control

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE A KATZ

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

MR. KATZ:

Justice Ginsburg,

I'd like to begin

13

by responding to one of your questions to Mr. Welsh

14

concerning the difference between Fitchik, Bolden, and

15

this case and Police Benevolent.

16

I believe that the Lake Country decision

17

indicated this Court's instructions that the Treasury

18

factor, while not necessarily the only factor, is the most

19

strongly weighted factor in determining these issues.

20

The Third Circuit has recognized that to be

21

true, as is evidenced by the formula that it follows in

22

deciding its cases.

23

indicated that not only did the Third Circuit believe

24

that's what this Court has said in its past cases, but

25

almost every other circuit has agreed the same.

Amici for the Port Authority has also

1

The problem with this case, the problem with the

2

Police Benevolent case, and the reason that the Port

3

Authority has been handled differently than the other

4

entities is, as I discussed earlier, simply because the

5

Third Circuit misread the statute.

6

this matter on a very narrow holding.

7

This Court can resolve

This Court can confirm that in fact, as stated

8

in Lake Country, when determining whether or not an entity

9

is entitled to the protection of the Eleventh Amendment,

10

the State Treasury factors are the reason that some

11

entities are extended that protection.

12

This Court can then find that the Third Circuit

13

simply misread the statute and misapplied that

14

constitutional formula.

15

those last three or four words of the statute, it would

1(5

not have found that there was a discretion -- or, I'm

17

sorry, it would not have found that there was a compulsive

18

requirement on the part of the States to fund the entity.

19

That is the narrow ruling of this case, and it goes to the

20

heart of why there is that discrepancy between the Third

21

Circuit's opinions.

22

Had the Third Circuit included

Mr. Welsh indicated the importance of the

23

consent to sue statute, and its relevance in terms of the

24

position of the States with respect to sovereign immunity.

question, why should it make a difference whether there is

2

technically an obligation on the part of the State of New

3

York and New Jersey to come to the assistance of a now-

4

bankrupt Port Authority, or PATH?
I mean, if, in fact, the alternative is that the

5
6

whole Port -- you don't really think New York and New

7

Jersey are going to let the Port Authority cease to

8

function.
MR. KATZ:

9

Your Honor, I don't expect that the

10

State of New York is going to let New York City go totally

11

bankrupt, either, but New York City would not be entitled

12

to the protection of the Eleventh Amendment.

13

any other State and any other political subdivision.

Likewise,

This Court has recognized that political

14
15

subdivisions, counties, and municipalities, are not

16

entitled to the protection of the Eleventh Amendment.
QUESTION:

17

Not -- there are good reasons why New

18

York would not be entitled to sovereign immunity, but I

19

question whether the good reason is just simply the State

20

of New York does not bear the expenses of the City of New

York.

functions, is governed by State officers,

2

that it makes a whole lot of difference whether

3

technically the funds come directly out of the Treasury or

4

the functions are so important to the State that, as a

5

practical matter, if the entity is bankrupt the State is

6

going to have to reach into its pocket to support it.

doesn't seem to me to be a factor of that overwhelming

significance.

There are certain legislative

If the State of New York and the State of New

5

Jersey cannot agree on another issue with regard to the

Port Authority from now until the end of time, the Port

Authority will continue to operate on its own, following

8

the past legislative mandates, determining on its own the

rules and regulations.

10

I direct the Court's attention and invite your

11

attention to the fact that the Compact provides that all

12

of the details for the effectuation, the financing, the

13

leasing, the tolls, the rentals, et cetera, are within the

14

sole discretion and are controlling conclusive -- I

15

apologize.

16

That's in a statute.
The Compact itself provides that the Port

17

Authority will have all powers necessary and appropriate

18

to effectuate the plan other than the power to tax.

19

authority has enormous power on its own, and that power is

20

exercised as a large landlord in the New York area.

They own the World Trade Center.

They own
