ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE REICH

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. REICH:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

11

The issue in this case is the effect of section

12

402(b)(3) of ERISA on a plan term included in a governing

13

plan document, a summary plan description, issued by a

14

plan sponsor that had reserved the right to modify, amend,

15

or terminate the plan from its inception as an ERISA plan.

16

It does not concern the right of the plan sponsor to

17

terminate company-paid retiree medical benefits, which the

18

lower courts agreed it has.

19

Section 402(b)(3) provides simply that every

20

employee benefit plan shall provide a procedure for

21

amending such plan and for identifying the persons who

22

have authority to amend the plan.

23

In considering the requirements of section

24

402(b)(3), it should be kept in mind that ERISA applies to

25

a variety of employee benefit plans.

Initially, there is

the dichotomy between pension plans and welfare plans.
Pension plans are subject to a panoply of

plans and not welfare plans.

Some pension plans are subject to substantive

Most pension plans have some

10

trustees involved and plans that do not.

11

a trustee obviously impacts upon the need for -- upon the

12

procedure for amendment, since a trustee may require that

13

amendments be made -- affecting it be made only with its

14

consent.

15

The presence of

Some plans are adopted unilaterally by a plan

16

sponsor as a voluntary matter, and other plans are adopted

17

under the provisions of a binding collective bargaining

18

agreement which obviously adds a layer of complexity to

19

the amendment of the plan.

20

Other plans, both pension and welfare, are

21

single employer plans, and some multiemployer plans.

22

many cases, multiemployer plans, and even, indeed, single

23

employer plans, will involve regulations under section 302

24

of the Taft-Hartley Act.

MR. REICH:

In many cases, there might, indeed,

2

be a need for a procedure for identifying.

3

suggest that, since the end result that is obviously

4

intended by Congress is that there be an identification,

5

if the situation is a simple one such as here, it should

6

be sufficient to identify the person.

7

I would

There should not need to be a procedure merely

8

for saying that the plan sponsor will set forth a

9

procedure for identifying itself as a plan sponsor.

10

would seem superfluous to utter those words as an

11

incantation when the purpose - -

QUESTION:

It

So as applied here, you think its

surplusage?

14

MR. REICH:

I'm sorry, I didn't hear the word.

15

QUESTION:

As applied in this case with a single

16

employer voluntary welfare benefit plan, is the

17

identification of the person who has the authority to

18

amend just surplusage?

19

MR. REICH:

Is that your argument?
I would think it would be.

Here it

20

would be surplusage, since the goal of identification is

21

the goal, and there is no need for a procedure here.

22

most -- in many cases, there is a need.

25

I say, of section 302.

the authority, unless it was stated.
MR. REICH:

It would be questionable.

You -- I

6

believe you could state, for example, as 302(b)(5) does

7

provide that, that it will be the trustees, who are

8

supposed to be jointly drawn from the employers who are

involved in the plan and the union that is involved in the

administration of the plan.

It's a bipartite board of

Well, Mr. Reich, would you accept the

13

proposition that the --or the position that in fact there

14

is a procedure in your plan for identifying the persons

15

with authority, and that procedure is implicit in your

16

designation as -- of the company as, in fact, the entity

17

that can amend?

18

MR. REICH:

19

QUESTION:

I would, sir.
And that that carries the implication

20

that the company could amend through the action or

21

authority of its board of directors, so that you in fact

22

satisfy the procedure-identification criterion here?

23

MR. REICH:

I would, Justice Souter, and I would

24

say further that it would not merely be the board of

25

directors, since a corporation may act by whomever the -7

QUESTION:

In fact, that's why Judge Roth

3

thought you were -- that you struck out, because it wasn't

4

done by the board of directors, isn't that right?

5

MR. REICH:

Well, Judge Roth, there's a

distinction -- if you read the footnote, there is a

distinction between what Judge Roth said in the footnote

resolution which would be in the corporate records, or by

22

Indeed, authority exists -- "Authority may be

QUESTION:

Well, it does as a matter of general

10

corporation law, but isn't there a problem in this statute

11

in relying upon that kind of identification, because at

12

least it seems to me a likely reading of subsection (3)

13

that by requiring a procedure for identifying the persons

14

with authority, what Congress is trying to get at is, is

15

to provide a means by which somebody who wants to know

16

what the current status of the plan is can determine who

17

to ask and, therefore, unless there is in effect something

18

of record somewhere showing who might be amending this,

1

that it would not satisfy the provisions of

20

subsection (3), even though, under general corporation

21

law, an undesignated individual might have authority to do

22

something.

flaw, and perhaps a second flaw, but one immediate flaw,

MR. REICH:

QUESTION:

7

(Laughter.)
MR. REICH:

8

9

We have that way in New Jersey, sir.
It rhymes with law -- law.

The term that the Congress used was

"persons," and persons is expressly defined in section

10

(3)(9) of ERISA as including a corporation.

11

indication that Congress intended, when it used a word

12

that included "corporation," to require that there be an

13

identification of individuals within the corporation that

14

act for the corporation.

15

QUESTION:

There is no

Well, I'll grant you that, but isn't

16

it also the case that if Congress did not want some means

17

of identifying institutionally who could take the action,

18

then Congress wouldn't have bothered to be talking

19

generally about identifying individuals.

20

would have said the plan must designate those persons who

21

can amend.

22

They simply

But by saying the plan must provide a procedure

23

for identifying, it seems to carry the further implication

24

that somebody who wants to know something should be able

25

to know who to ask.

MR. REICH:

1

Well, that -- there is a gloss of

2

legislative history on this that may suggest, Justice

3

Souter, to the contrary, because when you witness the fact

4

that the predecessor provision of this in H.R. 2 gave the

5

plan administrator the authority in certain limited

6

situations to amend the plan, and this took that and

7

simply allowed the plan to provide for who might amend the

8

plan.

9

And I would suggest that, as you suggested in an

10

earlier question, that the identification in the plan of

11

the plan sponsor, the company, as the person with the

12

authority to amend, should satisfy the procedure.

13

must have been -- may have been Justice O'Connor's

14

question, but --

15

QUESTION:

That

But under the earlier scheme, anybody

16

who wanted to know if there had been an unpublished

17

amendment would know enough to ask -- what was it, the

18

administrator, I guess you said?

19

MR. REICH:

20

QUESTION:

Yes.
Yes -- would know enough to ask the

21

administrator in order to make sure there wasn't something

22

not on the record.

23

MR. REICH:

Yes, but the administrator could

have been the company, as it can be and frequently is,

QUESTION:

In any event, it is the

there is anyone who, under the corporation law of, what,

11

Delaware, in this case, I guess, could be amending this

plan without being designated by a vote of the directors,

13

or by some reference in the bylaws?

14

On your theory, whom do I ask?

MR. REICH:

Do I go to

variety -- well, the bylaws wouldn't -- probably not be

there anyway.

They probably could be - -

In that case, how would I find

description, and that person -- that person could be

inquired of to - - as to whether or not there has been an

In this case, I would suggest that there was no
need, and this is the other thing that I alluded to in

response to your earlier question, and that is that

2

this - - this is not some disembodied amendment that we are

3

talking about,

some document sitting out there.

This was a term that was incorporated in the

4
5

document,

the SP - - summary plan description that the

6

district court found to be a governing plan document and

7

that the plaintiffs have conceded to be a -- one of the

8

two governing plan documents,

the other being the plan

constitution that set forth the procedure for amendment by
10
11

naming the company as the amending authority.
QUESTION:

Well, let me step back,

if I may.

If

12

Congress didn't want to provide for anything more

13

elaborate than the capacity of an inquirer like me to go

14

to the administrator of the plan and say, what does it

15

provide right now, why would it have enacted anything as

16

elaborate as requiring an identification for a procedure

17

for those with authority to amend?

Isn't it the case that there could be an amendment that is

period of time, I forget what it is?

8

MR. REICH:

QUESTION:

That is correct.
So that if you went to the

administrator and said, let me see what you've got,

11

technically the administrator might not have every

whether it had reserved the right to amend the plan, the

company?

12

MR. BRESS:

If you agree with the Government's

13

position that the Third Circuit got it wrong and there

14

was, in fact, a procedure in this case, we believe that

15

the correct result would be to remand back to the Third

16

Circuit to determine whether the company acted to

17

promulgate the amendment in this case.

18

And by "the company acted," what I mean is

whether the persons or individuals within the company who

20

promulgated the amendment had the corporate authority to

do so.

We agree with the

22

petitioner that the term "person" includes the term

25

natural persons, it used the term,

"individual," and it

intentionally, so that identification of the corporation

would be sufficient.

Here, where

However, there are circumstances, for example,

that would be promulgated by a banker insurance company

1

and we don't believe that that leaves the beneficiaries

2

and participants out in the cold.
The plan fiduciary has an independent duty,

3
4

under section 404(a) of the act, to perform his or her

5

duties solely in the interests of the participants and

6

beneficiaries, and to administer the plan in accordance

7

with its terms, so the fiduciary will have a duty, given

8

uncertainty, to determine what it is -- who it is that has

9

the ability to amend, and whether they have followed the

10

manner of amendment that that set forth.
QUESTION:

11
12

Has the IRS modified its prototype

plan in response to the Third Circuit's decision?

13

MR. BRESS:

No, it has not.

It has not.

14

I'd like to turn, if I may, to the second

15

question presented in this case, which is whether, if the

16

Court were to determine that the procedure in this case

17

was not sufficient, that would mean that the amendment was

18

therefore invalid.

19

When a plan makes clear that the plan can be

20

amended by the plan sponsor, it would be odd in our view

21

to interpret that document to be unamendable simply

22

because it lacked a detailed description of the manner of

23

amendment.

24
25

It would be far more natural, in our view, to
recognize the effectiveness of the amendment if the person

identified has clearly manifested its or his intention to

2

change the plan.

3

the common law of trusts, and it is an approach that in

4

our view is consistent with Congress' basic intention,

5

which is that plans be amendable.

That's the approach that was used under

Further, it's an approach that is consistent, in

6

7

our view, with the interests of participants and

8

beneficiaries.
When you have a circumstance such as in this

9
10

case, where it's clear that the plan can be amended, and

11

it's clear that the plan -- that the plan sponsor has said

12

that the plan has been amended, the harm suffered by the

13

participants and beneficiaries, if they've suffered harm,

14

has been from the substance of the amendment, not from the

15

failure to provide a procedure.

16

It would be inconsistent, we believe, with

17

Congress' intent that beneficiaries and participants be

18

able to rely on the terms of the document as written to

19

invalidate the plan under these circumstances.
That leaves, of course, the question of whether

20
21

ERISA itself prohibits amendments in the absence of a plan

22

procedure.

23

We do not believe that it does.
The harm caused by the failure to have a

24

procedure is the failure to provide guidance to the

25

fiduciaries.

The fiduciaries will, in the ordinary

1

course, simply go to the employer in that kind of a

2

circumstance and request further guidance, more detailed

3

procedures.

4

In the unlikely event that the corporation or

5

sponsor were to refuse, ERISA provides a tailored remedy.

6

Under section 502(a)(3), the fiduciary can enjoin the

7

employer to provide a more specific procedure.
Because ERISA provides that remedy, it need not

be read to provide a remedy of invalidation, or to require

10

a procedure for amendment as a condition precedent to

12

honestly be read -- that 402(b)(3) should not be read to

13

provide -- to serve as a condition precedent, because

14

there are various other provisions in the act in which

Congress has made clear its intention to have a condition

precedent when it wanted to.

We agree with petitioner that the act cannot

MR. KENNEDY:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
I'd like to take this Court briefly through the

12

process of how we got here, both to assist you in

13

answering your questions, and to help frame the statutory

14

issues posed.

15

This plan had its origin in a pre-ERISA retiree

benefit plan maintained by Curtiss-Wright Corporation for

17

its nonunion retirees.

18

adopted, the plan created two documents, a trust and a

the secretary of the corporation.
Similarly, 6 months later when the plan

3

constitution was adopted to comply with ERISA, the record

4

reflects at Joint Appendix 40 an execution by a corporate

5

vice president, a dating, and an attestation by the

6

corporate secretary.

7

Seven years later, when this corporation acted

8

to deprive the plaintiff class of their benefits, nothing

9

like that type of procedure was followed.

Instead,

10

through an act of casual redrafting -- and we direct the

11

Court's attention to the findings of the district court,

12

particularly at page 38 of the appendix to the petition --

13

there were no formal procedures followed in any respect in

14

connection with the adoption of the term under which these

15

benefits were denied.

16

The court went further and found no informal

17

procedures were followed either.

18

casual redrafting had the effect of denying petitioners

19

the benefits which they had been led to believe would be

20

theirs for their lives.

QUESTION:

the other fiduciary sections of ERISA, which in our view

7

make clear that only an effective amendment can, in fact,

be enforced by a plan administrator.

It allows anyone to determine when the plan

written instrument, it has to be amended validly, or the

that a plan cannot be amended, but yet that could be

2

accomplished, and I'll explain to you our reasoning, and

3

what we believe was probably the Third Circuit reasoning.

4

Everyone in this case acknowledges that one of

5

the possible steps that a participant can take if a plan

6

lacks an amendment procedure is to go to court and obtain

7

an order under 502(a)(3) compelling the sponsor to adopt

8

the plan amendment.

9

In our view, a plan sponsor has an inherent

10

right to bring its plan into compliance with the express

11

terms of ERISA.

12

right to accomplish amendments that are in its own

13

financial self-interest and are not directed at complying

14

with ERISA.

That would not extend to an inherent

15

A procedure which -- or, rather, a recognition

16

that plan sponsors can add an amendment procedure really

17

only says to them that yes, if you notice you're out of

18

compliance with ERISA, there's no need to wait till a

19

participant drags you into court and compels you to

20

accomplish that which you should have done originally, at

21

the time the plan was created.

22

QUESTION:

Does that mean that any - - say there

23

are other provisions of the plan that did not satisfy

24

ERISA completely, and no amending procedure, they could

MR. KENNEDY:

2

Well, I think in our view the

3

sensible procedure would be to first enact the amendment

4

procedure and then accomplish the other goals through it.
QUESTION:

5

But what if they didn't realize

6

they -- say this case hadn't been decided, but they

7

realized they didn't have the proper funding provisions,

8

or something like that, or their benefits didn't comply

9

with certain things, could they make amendments to just

10

bring the plan in conformity with the statute, even though

11

there's no amendment procedure in the plan?
MR. KENNEDY:

12

Well, as the Solicitor General

13

pointed out, Your Honor, other courts have enforced ERISA

plans, though they be unwritten, and though they be

without a funding procedure, the theory being, I think,

So my answer is yes, in my view, a plan sponsor

could, consistent with the statute, take such actions as

QUESTION:

Right.

2

MR. KENNEDY:

The summary plan description in

3

this case, at Joint Appendix 53 and Joint Appendix 55,

4

provides that in the event of conflict between the plan

5

and this document called the summary plan description, the

6

plan itself will control, so that there is a question

7

about whether inserting the language within the summary

8

plan description actually was effective to accomplish

9

anything, though in our view, our participants were harmed

10

by the insertion of this language in the following manner.

11

QUESTION:

You don't think that you would be up

12

here arguing for your clients that if something had been

13

inserted into that summary of the plan and in fact had not

been adopted by the corporation, the corporation would

nonetheless be bound to pony up that particular benefit?

MR. KENNEDY:

Even were that true, Justice

3

Souter, the junior counsel would be, then, a fiduciary.

4

If it were up to him or her to make such an amendment,

5

they would be aware that an amendment in fact was

6

occurring, and they might recognize the decades of

7

representations made to the members of the plaintiff class

8

chat they would receive these benefits for life.

9

That decision, to make an affirmative change in

10

the terms of the plan, rather, to enforce what the

11

corporation may have improperly understood was part of its

12

plan, is a substantive right.

MR. KENNEDY:

QUESTION:

Mr. Kennedy, are you saying -A procedural one, yes --

Are you saying that every change, at

least every change that doesn't favor the plan

17

beneficiaries, that would ever be made in any plan that

followed the IRS prototype on the amendment clause, that

all of those changes would be no good, and so to know what

the plan contained, you'd have to go back to the very

When you understand that Congress recognised, in

between procedural defaults which arise under the

reporting and disclosure sections of the act and

3

procedural defaults that arise under fiduciary sections.
A number of courts have held that in order for a

5

participant to obtain benefits in a situation in which

6

there has been a default in the obligation to distribute a

summary plan description and so forth, in order to obtain

recovery, the participant must demonstrate a detrimental
reliance upon the information that was made available to

them.
In our view, that's inappropriate when the

default was not a reporting and disclosure obligation in

within the fiduciary sections of ERISA.

But you're building a great deal on

the requirement of a procedure, that State corporation law

5

MR. KENNEDY:

Well, Your Honor, the definition

6

of procedure, after all, in Black's Law Dictionary, is the

7

mode of effectuating a legal right, as opposed to the

8

legal right itself.

9

That requirement that a procedure be stated in

10

our view, given its natural reading, does require that the

11

plan set forth the mode of accomplishing a procedure for

12

amendment.

QUESTION:

What if this plan had said, the

company pursuant to New Jersey corporate law?
MR. KENNEDY:

Then, Your Honor, in our view, the

16

question would be whether the amendment had been valid

17

under New Jersey corporate law, but the fact that a plan

18

sponsor can self-describe that form of legal test, which

19

is what Congress intended, doesn't mean that in the case

20

of a default under the statute, leaving out any type of

21

procedure, this Court should extend to them the full range

22

of corporate law in making that determination.

corporation had adopted a resolution which says,

what if the board of directors has adopted a provision

If there were express action of

Okay.

Now, there isn't such an

QUESTION:

Mr. Kennedy --- failure --

--a lot of these amendments are a

11

product of negotiation between the union and the company,

12

and I presume a collective bargaining agreement doesn't

13

have to be approved by the board of directors to be valid,

but you'd say one incidental feature, we're going to raise

15

the pensions from $90 a month to $92.50, that would have

to be approved by the board of directors?

17

MR. KENNEDY:

Your Honor, I'm a union lawyer,

18

and I know full well, when I negotiate a contract with a

19

company, that that change to that pension plan hasn't

20

become effective until the plan has been amended to set

21

forth that change, even if we've got a collective

bargaining agreement over here which says that the

They negotiate about those terms,

plan to reflect the collective bargaining agreement is an

amendment of the plan by the proper amending authorities,

which would not include the union.

In our view, this statute is plainly set forth.
