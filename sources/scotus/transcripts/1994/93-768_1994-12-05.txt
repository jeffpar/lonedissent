CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

first this morning in Number 93-768, the Milwaukee Brewery-

Workers'

Pension Plan v. Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL G. BRUTON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BRUTON:

9
10
11

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
In 1981, the Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company

12

closed its Milwaukee plant and completely withdrew from

13

the Milwaukee Brewery Workers' Pension Plan, a defined

14

benefit, multiemployer plan in which Schlitz' employees

15

had participated since the plan's inception in 1954.

16

In the late 1970's and early 1980's,

the brewing

17

industry in Milwaukee was considered a declining industry.

18

The number of hours that plan participants were currently

19

working were diminishing.

20

age of plan participants, as well as their length of

21

service, was increasing.

22

many other multiemployer plans at that time, experienced

23

significant underfunding problems.

24
25

At the same time,

the average

As a result, this plan, like

As of December 31st,

1980, which was the last

day for this plan in the year prior to the year in which

1

Schlitz withdrew, this plan had unfunded but vested

2

liabilities in excess of $111 million.

3

represented the difference, as of that day, between the

4

fair cash market value of the plan's assets, approximately

5

$51 million, and the present cash value of the plan's

6

liability to pay for vested benefits at some future date,

7

as of that date, approximately 162 million.

8

9

That amount

It's significant to note that in 1980, in
reducing the future liabilities for present cash -- for

10

the vested benefits to present cash value, this plan used

11

a discount rate of 7 percent.

12

After carefully studying the problems that

13

multiemployer plans faced in the area of underfunding, and

14

the application of ERISA to the multiemployer plans,

15

Congress passed the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments

16

Act of 1980, or MPPAA.

17

Perhaps the most significant portion of MPPAA is

18

the requirement that a withdrawing employer continue to

19

make payments to a multiemployer plan in an effort to

20

fully fund a portion of the unfunded vested liabilities

21

which are attributed to that employer.

22

23
24
25

Simply stated, the question in this case is, how
much was Schlitz required to pay to this plan?
QUESTION:

Well, isn't the question even more

simply stated as the question of how much interest?

MR. BRUTON:

1

I think the question, Your Honor,

2

is, in total how much was Schlitz required to pay?

3

important component of the amount that Schlitz was

4

required to pay is the interest on the unfunded but vested

5

benefits that were allocated to it.
QUESTION:

6

7

And that's the point on which the

courts of appeals disagree, is it not?
MR. BRUTON:

8

9

The

That is correct.

It's important --

the answer to the question lies in the proper application

10

of section 4219(c)(1)(a) of MPPAA.

That provision can be

11

found at page 4 of the blue brief of the petitioner.
In that section, Congress very carefully and

12

13

with great detail instructed that a presumed or

14

hypothetical payment schedule should be created in order

15

to determine the number of level annual payments that a

16

withdrawing employer should be required to make.

17

In this case, of the $111 million in unfunded

18

liabilities as of December 31st, 1980, Schlitz was

19

allocated $23.3 million, but Schlitz has not paid $23.3

20

million.

21

late with a payment, Schlitz has paid 28 -- approximately

22

$28.5 million.

23

Despite never missing a payment and never being

The plan submits that when section 4219(c)(1)(a)

24

is properly applied, that the plan -- that Schlitz should

25

have paid approximately $31.1 million.

That $2.6 million

difference depends on how the first payment in this

2

presumed schedule, which must be established under 4219,

3

is treated.

4

constructed, the payment schedule is contained in the blue

5

brief of petitioners at page 28 and 29.
QUESTION:

6

7

The plan submits that when properly

May I ask you a question about that

schedule?

8

Assume a case in which the annual payment that

9

it has to make is 100 percent of the unfunded liability.

10

One payment would do it, and the payment would be due in

11

August of the year, and it's made in August of the year.

12

They paid up to that time by the regular payment.

13

you say they also had to pay a year's interest on that?

14

MR. BRUTON:

Would

Justice Stevens, I believe that the

15

interpretation of the proper application of the prepayment

provision would provide the answer to that question.

1

all done in one simple payment, nevertheless you'd charge

2

them 1 year's interest and treat that as the amount of the

3

unfunded liability.

4

MR. BRUTON:

I think in the instance in which

5

the first payment actually occurred, or payment in full

6

actually occurred prior to the first day of the plan year

7

after withdrawal, that interest would be charged only for

8

the period from the last day of the plan year, the day on

9

which the amount of the unfunded vested liabilities are

10
11
12

13
14

fixed, and the day that the full actual payment is made.

MR. BRUTON:

Under your example, that's correct,

Justice Stevens.

Even though, if there had been no

20

lesser participation, they had stayed in the plan, paid

21

that amount, that discharged their liabilities and

22

everybody could go home, they'd still -- you have to add

23

on the interest because they're withdrawing.

and ease of calculation, eliminate -QUESTION:

2

But one isn't any easier to calculate

3

than the other.

I mean, your schedule is no -- wouldn't

4

be any harder to calculate if you just didn't put the

5

interest in in the first payment.
MR. BRUTON:

6

You'd have the same --

I agree that the -- the ease of

7

calculation, if you use either accrual of interest from

8

the date that the amount is fixed, the date of -- the last

9

day of the plan year before the withdrawal, or the first

10

date that the presumed payment is made, that those two

11

schedules are equally easy to calculate.
QUESTION:

12

Mr. Bruton, may I ask if ease of

13

calculation is the reason why you are not urging, as

14

Central States is, the Easterbrook position as a fallback?

15

That is, using the date of withdrawal as the critical

16

date?

17

MR. BRUTON:

We carefully looked at the statute,

18

and we could find no support in the statute for Judge

19

Easterbrook's position that in some way a portion of the

20

interest during that period could be charged to the

21

withdrawing employer.

22

should be amortized.

23

issue in this case, the word "interest" does not appear.

24

The statute does not limit or qualify the term,

25

"amortize."

The statute says that the payment

QUESTION:

1

So the choices as you see it are only

2

the two on which the Fourth Circuit and the Third Circuit

3

divided?

4

MR. BRUTON:

That is correct, Justice Ginsburg.

5

We view the statute as giving no alternative.

Congress

6

could have provided logically, rationally, reasonably to

7

begin interest from the date of withdrawal, or until the

8

date of the first actual payment.

There are many

alternative scenarios that Congress could have constructed
10

in order to approach the equity that they were attempting

11

to achieve.

12

However, the one that Congress selected is the

13

scenario in which the amount of the unfunded liabilities

14

are calculated as of the last day of the plan year prior

15

to withdrawal.

16

QUESTION:

Even if the withdrawal occurred on

17

that -- in fact occurred on that very last day, so that

18

the employer had made all the contributions for that year?

1

MR. BRUTON:

That is correct, Justice Ginsburg.

20

In fact, if it occurred on the last day, using the

21

timetable in this case as an example, if the withdrawal in

22

this case had occurred on December 31st, 1 80, the

23

calculation of the amount of unfunded vested liabilities

24

would have been as of December 31st, 1 7 .

25

would have been making contributions for that entire year.

Those contributions may or may not have reduced

the unfunded vested liabilities from the level that they

existed a year earlier.

4

the need to continually recalculate that amount,

5

essentially said we will not consider for that year of

6

withdrawal any additions to or subtractions from the

7

unfunded vested liabilities.

8

Congress, in order to eliminate

In other words, Congress considered the

9

contributions for that year, the actual contributions that

10

were being made, as a wash, and for purposes of making the

11

calculation easy to determine, and to prevent plans from

12

incurring enormous actuarial expenses each time a

13

withdrawing employer decided to withdraw, a simple method

14

of just designating the end of the plan year prior to

15

withdrawal was adopted.

16

QUESTION:

Before we get too far away from

17

Justice Stevens' question, I want to make sure I

18

understand the answer.

19

If Schlitz had paid the full amount of the

20

demand in 1981 -- that is to say, before the first payment

21

was due -- what interest component would Schlitz have been

22

liable for?

23

demand -- when was the demand, sometime in August?

Suppose it paid it the day after the

the date that the amount was fixed, the end of the prior

2

plan year -- in this case it would be December 31st of

3

1980.

4

August 31st, 1981, the amount of interest that they would

5

have had to pay in addition to the $23.3 million, would be

interest which accrued from the December 31st, 1980 date

to the August 31, 1981 date.

your position that the interest has to be included as if
the payment isn't made until January 1,

'82.

Congress provided that an

employer - QUESTION:

13

I'd say that's perfectly sensible

14

from a financial standpoint, but it seems to me to

15

undercut your theory in this case.
MR. BRUTON:

16

It does not, because the prepayment

17

provision is entirely separate from the provision that is

18

utilized to calculate the number of long-term payments, so

19

to speak.
QUESTION:

20

But why is it that interest is not

21

charged if there's a full discharge at once, but it is not

full year of interest.
QUESTION:

2

Yes, but isn't the -- all right,

3

isn't that if the calculation is made on the assumption in

4

effect on your theory that the debt becomes due on

5

December 31 of the previous year, and that the first

6

payment is made on January 1 of the year following the

7

withdrawal, so isn't there always going to be 1 year's

8

accrued interest whenever you make the first payment, even

9

if you prepay it?

10
11

Aren't you liable for 1 year's accrued

interest?
MR. BRUTON:

The scenario, as I understood the

12

hypothetical question, was that the $23.3 million would be

13

the amount tendered at the first full payment, and it

14

would be our position that that would be insufficient,

15

because by that point in time, at least a portion of the

16

first year's worth of interest will have accrued.

17

QUESTION:

Yes, but I thought the payment

18

schedule -- I mean, first there's a calculation as to the

19

unfunded liability.

20

understand it, based on these conventions of December 31

21

of one year, January 1 of the next following one, there is

22

a calculation of the first payment due, and the first

23

payment due is made on the conventional assumption that a

24

year is going to - - a full year is going to elapse.

25

So therefore, isn't the question, on your

Then there's a calculation - - as I

theory, not whether 8 months of interest would have

2

accrued if X dollars was due on -- it was due 8 months

3

before, but rather, isn't the accrued liability plus a

4

year's interest due whenever you make the first payment,

5

whether you make it at the last possible date, or whether

6

you make it at the first possible date?
MR. BRUTON:

7

The prepayment provision, which is

8

set forth at page 25 of the red brief of the respondent,

9

specifically says what must be prepaid in order to comply

10

with this statute, and it is somewhat counterintuitive.

11

The employer shall be entitled to prepay the outstanding

12

amount of the unpaid annual withdrawal liability payments.

13

QUESTION:

And doesn't that annual withdrawal

14

liability payment include on this conventional calculation

15

basis a year of interest?

16

MR. BRUTON:

17

QUESTION:

It does.
Okay.

So then why is your answer to

18

Justice Kennedy that he only has to pay 8 months of

19

interest?

20
21
22

MR. BRUTON:

The statute goes on to say that

they should also pay accrued interest, if any.
QUESTION:

Yes, but I thought your answer -- I

23

thought your interpretation of that provision was that

24

accrued interest there refers to interest which accrued on

25

any payments as to which the employer was delinquent.

1

We're not talking about delinquency payments.

2

We're talking about the interest, which is never called

3

interest in the statute, which is implied by the concept

4

of amortization, so it seems to me that, given your

5

answers both to the so-called if any objection, and your

6

construction of the statute based on this conventional

7

scheme, that the first payment, whenever it is made, even

8

if it is prepaid at the first possible moment, should

9

include a year's --a year of interest.

MR. BRUTON:

Yes, Justice Souter and, in fact,

while it is not --

MR. BRUTON:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. BRUTON:

Is that your answer now?
It is.
Okay.
And in fact, while it is not an

16

issue in this case, I think that taken to its logical

17

extension, the entire amount, that some total of all of

18

the required payments in this presumed schedule, in our

19

case $31.1 million, is the amount that would be due if

20

there was a prepayment at any time, and there --

QUESTION:

And you get that conclusion out of

22

the word "amortize" in this section, and it's puzzling to

23

me how an amortization of a single payment for the full

amount of principal due would contemplate interest being

25

paid on that amount if you pay it promptly.

If it was -If they'd made the payments up to

MR. BRUTON:

If the amount that was being funded

was calculated as of the date that the first payment was

made, I agree it would fully fund --

It was calculated as of the January

date, but the employer has made payments from January to

August under the old schedule.

And Congress has said -And the presumption is that when he

MR. BRUTON:

It is a complex

It is one that is not at issue in this case

However, if you carefully read what Congress

18

permitted in the prepayment provision, it is that the

19

employer is entitled to prepay the outstanding amount of

20

the unpaid annual withdrawal liability payments -- annual

21

withdrawal liability payments.

22

That provision, while it has not been

interpreted by this Court, can be interpreted to mean that

of the payments in this schedule which is created by 4219.

QUESTION:

Because annual is calculated on the

2

assumption that the debt begins to run on the date that

3

the amount of the debt is calculated, and that no payment

4

is made until a full year has elapsed, so therefore the

5

annual payment implies, by definition, a year of interest.

6

MR. BRUTON:

That is correct.

7

And in addition, if you step back for a moment

8

and put this in the context of MPPAA, in which this Court

9

has already recognized the purpose was to protect the plan

10

participants and their beneficiaries as well as the

11

employers who continued to contribute to the plan, a

12

scenario could be constructed, a prepayment scenario,

13

using some of the figures in this case, for example,

14

wherein an employer, in times of decreasing return on

15

market investments -- let's say, for example, the market

16

was returning approximately 3 percent rather than the 7

17

percent interest rate which was used in this case, an

18

employer would have an incentive to prepay if it did not

19

have to pay the full amount of the annual withdrawal

20

liability payments.

21

QUESTION:

Isn't the assumption that the

22

actuaries used realistic interest rates?

23

use a 7 percent rate for one year when the interest is

24

really 3 percent.

MR. BRUTON:

There are -- there will be

instances, there is no question that there will be

13

instances in which, on a purely actuarial analysis the

14

withdrawing employer will pay something more than is

necessary to make the plan whole.

QUESTION:

This is such a case, isn't it,

Not necessarily, Justice Stevens.

just the point that's being raised, that if in fact your

most, it seems to me, that the fund could ever lose, is

it seemed to me the way this works is, $23 million is what

would be necessary to make the plan whole as of, let's

payments of $4 million, because that's their normal

Front-loaded or back-loaded.

Now, if

5

you assume, as you'd want to, that it's back-loaded, then

6

the money that's coming in is as if they paid not a penny

from day zero, but in reality the employer will always be

8

making his monthly payments throughout the year, until the

9

minute he withdraws, and as of the minute he withdraws,

10

there's then, if the plan wants it, it can get as much as

11

they want 60 days later.

12

So I didn't say, see how in reality the plan

13

could lose more than that 60-day period, plus whatever

4

It also contemplates that at the end of this

of the amount being amortized, and since that amount is

unfunded vested benefits to Schlitz as of day zero and

make sure that Schlitz makes enough payments to fully fund

MR. WILLARD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

3

Schlitz' position is that the obligation to pay

4

does not arise until after the plan calculates the amount

5

of the withdrawal liability and transmits a demand for

6

payment, so that if Schlitz were to pay the full amount of

7

the principal in this case, the allocated share of the

8

unfunded vested benefits, within the demand period, then

9

it would pay no interest.

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Willard, did the Pension Benefit

11

Board adopt a position on the proper rule to be applied in

12

this situation?

13

MR. WILLARD:

the demand notice that's sent out by the plan when there's

a withdrawal includes two things,

amount of the allocated share of unfunded vested benefits.

2

That's the amount they demanded that Schlitz pay.

3

It didn't include any interest, and in the

4

hearing before the arbitrator, which is also cited in our

5

brief, the plan's expert witness agreed that this amount

6

did not include any interest.

7

And so we have a situation where, under the

8

statute, and as the demand letter was sent in this case, a

9

demand was made for the payment of a principal sum, no

10

interest, and our position is that if Schlitz had paid

11

that principal sum, it would have paid no interest at all,

12

and therefore, that is the point at which the liability

13

arises, and if Schlitz chose to pay over time thereafter,

14

interest would begin to accrue at the point that the

15

liability arises.

16

The position of the petitioners in this case

17

would be a little bit as if you were buying a house and

18

interest began to run not from the date title was

19

transferred, but from the date the appraisal was done,

20

which may have been some months earlier.

date -- that the debt, rather, comes into existence on the

2

date it's amount is calculated, so that if literally you

3

paid at any time after that date, the December 31 date,

4

some interest would have run.
MR. WILLARD:

Well, that is the position that

6

the plaintiff has taken, although it's a little unclear

7

how much interest they claim would arise and how it would

8

be calculated, but -QUESTION:

9

Well, is it unclear after the

10

argument?

I mean, I thought it was clear after the

11

argument that at least a year's interest --

-- is going to be added on.

14

thought that was their position.

15

MR. WILLARD:

I

I believe his position was 8 years

of interest would be added on.

In other words, if you

because interest would run - -

3

QUESTION:

Under their interpretation, as I

4

understand it, the word,

5

would refer to interest on delinquent payments, because

6

their argument is that interest -- the interest that is

7

implied by the concept of amortization is, in fact, never

8

expressly referred to in the statute, and that when the

9

statute does speak of interest, it's referring to interest

10

on delinquency, so I'd like to know your response to that,

11

but isn't -- to begin with, isn't their view, at least

12

internally, consistent?

13

MR. WILLARD:

"interest" preceding "if any"

There's one problem with their

14

view, Justice Souter, and that is that the subsection (6),

15

which appears at page 9a of the appendix to our brief,

16

refers to the interest that's used in calculating the

17

amortization schedule as an exception to the normal

18

interest accrual rule.

19

It says,

"Except as provided in paragraph

20

(1) (A) (ii)," which is where it talks about constructing

21

the amortization schedule,

22

shall be charged at rates based on prevailing market

23

rates," which refers then to the delinquent interest, so

24

the statute itself in (6) appears to create two categories

25

of interest, interest that's charged at prevailing market

"interest under this subsection

28

1

rates, which is the default interest, and interest which

2

is calculated as it is under paragraph (1)(A)(ii), which

3

refers to the construction of the amortization schedule.

4

So while the statute is admittedly a bit opaque,

5

it does appear to view interest as being involved in both

6

concepts, the amortization schedule as well as the payment

7

of delayed -- payment of interest on delayed obligations.

8

9

QUESTION:

Before you get off the prepaid

interest statute, it does seem to me that you can explain

10

the "if any" consistently with the position that Schlitz

11

takes, save and except that it is entitled to all of the

12

accrued interest.

13

It seems to me that the "if any" could mean

14

that, assume that Schlitz in the third year, if it's

15

making yearly payments, decides it's going to pay

16

everything, and it makes a timely payment, and then if it

17

prepays all the balance, it would pay no interest, and

18

that could explain the word "if any," it seems to me.

explanation that the Third Circuit in Huber gave to the

1

would be treated as two separate payments, but normally,

2

at any point after the amortization schedule begins, there

3

would be some accrued interest at that point, and so if

4

you were to prepay at any point after the amortization

5

schedule starts, there would be some amount of accrued

interest.

It's interesting, the legislative history

discloses when that "if any" term appeared.

version of this statute, as drafted by PBGC, provided that

10

interest accrued from the date of withdrawal until paid at

11

market rates, a very simple, maybe sensible solution, but

12

one that Congress got rid of.

13

The original

Instead, they took out all references to

14

interest accruing on timely paid obligations and added in

15

the words "if any" after the reference to interest in this

16

section, and so it suggests that Congress recognized, when

17

they took out the reference to interest accruing from the

18

date of withdrawal, which means interest would always

19

accrue to some extent, if there is a 60-day demand for

20

payment, to indicate that they contemplated that if timely

21

payment was made immediately after withdrawal, there

22

wouldn't be interest, that interest would only accrue if

you paid over time and not in a lump sum at once.

MR. WILLARD:

6

The record shows in this case that

7

the valuations were generally done about the middle of the

8

year, May, June, July.
QUESTION:

9

All right.

Then if that's typical,

10

and if your interpretation is correct, and the 60-day

11

period is there, there would be then be typically 8 months

12

of interest lost to the funds, which means that typically

13

in a statute designed to make funds whole, you would have

14

8 months too little money, 8 months' worth of interest.

15

That seems to me an odd interpretation of a statute where

16

the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation told the Third

17

Circuit it was totally unclear.
MR. WILLARD:

18

Well, I think we should look at

19

the facts of our case to try to illustrate that.

It

20

really depends on when the withdrawal occurs during the

If it begins at the very beginning --

22

QUESTION:

That's why I'm speaking typically.

23

MR. WILLARD:

That's right.

If it occurs at the

24

beginning of the plan year, then there would be a longer

25

gap while waiting for the valuation.

The valuation has to

be done by statute every year anyway, and so the statute,

by keying onto this, produces an efficiency, because if

the valuation is already done, then it's a very simple

matter to get the assessment made.

In fact, they only made 5 months of contributions during

8

that plan year, because they were struck on May 31st and

9

ceased operations thereafter.

Schlitz withdrew in August of 1981.

But for 5 months of the year they were making

10
11

contributions, and the contributions were required by

12

statute to include an amount to amortize the unfunded

13

liability, to bring down the $23 million liability to a

14

lower number and, in fact, here, they did.
Pages 201 to 206 of the Joint Appendix show that

15
16

the normal cost of this plan was only a little over

17

$1 million a year, and yet the actual contributions

18

projected for the year were $9 million, so almost

19

90 percent of the contributions that were being made were

20

going to pay interest on or to reduce the unfunded

21

liabilities.

Only a little over 10 percent were actually

22

normal cost.

So during that 5-month period, Schlitz made

23

a considerable contribution to reduce the amount of the

24

liability.

Then there is the gap.

here, and in fact this whole issue, is a dispute among

2

employers.

3

This is a dispute -- the real parties at

4

interest on the other side are Miller and Pabst, because

5

if the more Schlitz pays as a withdrawal liability, the

6

less they have to pay, and vice versa, so this is not a

7

dispute between beneficiaries and employers.

it's a dispute among employers for how the funding is

going to be allocated.

QUESTION:

Instead,

You're not suggesting that the

petitioner, here, is not a legitimate litigant?
MR. WILLARD:

No, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not.

13

I'm simply pointing out that the real interest here is the

14

interest of the remaining employers, because if Schlitz

contributes less, then the remaining employers have to

contribute more to make up unfunded liability.

only, whereas under the petitioner's view, they would

always assess 12 months' interest, even though the gap is

3

much shorter.
QUESTION:

4

But if there is a gap -- either way

5

you move, there's going to be one side or the other

6

disadvantaged, so why don't we fall back on the beneficial

7

purpose of this whole plan, this whole scheme?
MR. WILLARD:

8

9

Well, first of all, if the statute

is silent on the issue of charging interest of this

10

withdrawal here, period, then we believe that the courts

11

do not have the authority on their own to impose that

12

liability.

13

care of this problem, or if there is a gap in the

14

statutory scheme, then that should -- that problem should

15

be solved by Congress and not the courts.

In other words, if Congress forgot to take

16

In our view, the statutory language makes it - -

17

does not provide for the assessment of this interest, and

18

the legislative history makes it clear that this was not a

19

simply oversight but was a deliberate choice that Congress

20

made in the process of drafting the statute.
QUESTION:

21

You're stressing the difference

22

between ambiguity and simply making no provision, is that

23

it?

You said, there's no room for construction?

That is correct, Justice Ginsburg,

ambiguous statute that could be read to allow the

2

imposition of interest.

3

provides for it.

4

There simply is nothing here that

It's clear under the statute that the liability

5

arises, and the amount of the liability, when it arises,

6

is the principal amount, not the principal amount plus a

7

year of interest, and so we don't think there's room here

8

for the Court to find the imposition of interest, and the

9

legislative history makes it clear it is a deliberate

10
11

choice.
There is the reference to whether or not the

12

liability is front-loaded or back-loaded.

13

point the liability was back-loaded.

14

the bill provided that the presumed payments -- the

15

payments were presumed to be made as if they occurred at

16

the end of the year in which made, and that allowed for

17

the payment of 1 year of interest in the first year's

18

payments of interest.

Well, at one

20

it was passed on the floor, that was changed.

The

which the payments were made.

23

was originally back-loaded, turned into a front-loaded

statute between the first markup and the time the bill

25

passed on the floor of the House.

So the statute, while it

1

Why?

We don't know for sure.

We do know that a

2

number of changes were being made to reduce the amount of

3

withdrawal liability during the legislative process

4

because of complaints by employers that this was too

5

onerous, and we also know that at least one witness

6

testified, and we cited this at page 39 of our brief, that

7

the interest charges under the original bill would have

8

been excessive.

9

So while Congress didn't say, this is why we

10

made the change, we know they were making changes.

They

11

said they were making a number of changes in order to

12

reduce the amount of liability imposed on employers, and

13

they took a statute where the interest was back-loaded and

14

turned it into one that was front-loaded.

15

So while there are a number of other aspects of

16

the legislative history that we think support our reading

17

of this statute, we think it's clear that as to this one

18

feature, the accrual of interest, it is that interest

19

would not accrue until the point that the amortization

20

schedule began.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Willard, can I ask you a question

22

about your understanding of what it is in the statute that

23

imposes any interest obligation at all?

24
25

The reason I ask is that this is kind of a
strange amortization.

Instead of taking an amount and

1

then figuring out how long -- many years it would take to

2

pay it off, you take an amount and then you first figure

3

the amount of the annual payment, which is more or less a

4

substitute for your annual contributions, I guess, based

5

on - -

6

Why couldn't it have reasonably been argued that

7

if they are a substitute for contributions that would have

8

been made to pay off this liability, they should bear no

9

interest at all?

10

What is it in the statute that

forecloses that argument?
MR. WILLARD:

11

Well, I understand, Justice

12

Stevens, and initially I thought maybe there wasn't any

13

provision for statutory interest.

14

though, there is this reference to, in the section

15

accruing at market rates, that says,

in paragraph (1) (A) (ii) . "

After we look at it,

Actuarial projections generally are imprecise

1

2

and are normally supposed to be conservative.

That is,

3

actuaries are supposed to overestimate the liabilities,

4

not underestimate them, and here, for example, as pointed

5

out at page 174 of the Joint Appendix, this plan was

6

earning in the year of the valuation over 15 percent of

7

its investments, and yet they assumed they would only be

8

able to earn 7 percent as the actuarial rate of return.
Now, that's perfectly proper for an actuary to

9
10

do.

11

fact, the plan earned more than 7 percent on its

12

investments, then they wouldn't need nearly as much money

13

as they projected, and Schlitz would have overpaid.

14

They're supposed to be conservative.

years, but whatever rule we come up with is going to be a

statute on the assumption that even conservative actuaries

are always going to produce that much luck for them.

MR. WILLARD:

You're saying they had a

I understand, Justice Souter, but

21

what I'm pointing out is, actuaries generally try to err

22

on the conservative side, so it's not a situation where

23

it's equally likely to be wrong one way than another.

24

Actuaries are supposed to and, generally, try to be

25

conservative to provide a cushion there, so there is a

cushion that's provided.

2

Also, the annual payment formula here is skewed

3

to require employers in a declining industry like this to

4

pay more money after they withdraw than they did before,

5

so that the annual contribution from Schlitz actually went

6

up after it withdrew and no longer had employees

7

participating in the plan.

8

And then finally, the plan is revalued every

9

year, and the assumptions are adjusted, so that if the

10

plan is having a streak of bad luck, the actuarial

11

assumptions are adjusted, the funding levels are changed,

12

and the remaining employers make up the difference.

The actuarial valuation date at that point

was -- there were alternatives, depending on whether you

use the presumptive method, in which case it was the end

of the year in which withdrawal occurred, or all other

15

methods it was the beginning of the year in which

16

withdrawal occurred, and so for them to have required

there to be 1 year of interest in addition to the interest

18

of the year in which the payment was made would have

required 2 years of interest, but that would not

20

necessarily have taken you back to the valuation day,

21

which might have been 1 year, a year-and-a-half, 2 years,

22

who knows ?

one point or another by chance.

It doesn't coincide with

The various people who changed it as it went along, and

they did it, and that's what happened, and so we have a

statute here that does not provide for the accrual of

QUESTION:

Mr. Willard, do you know why Judge

2

Easterbrook thought the case that created the split really

3

didn't, because at the end of his opinion he says that he

4

thought it doubtful that Huber actually held the employer

5

must pay interest from the valuation date.

6

MR. WILLARD:

As I recall in Huber, Justice

7

Ginsburg, the withdrawal occurred at the outset of the

8

plan year, and so it was a little hard to tell whether the

9

court in Huber meant that interest should accrue from the

10

date of withdrawal or from the end of the prior plan year,

11

since they were so close together in time, and in fact one

12

later district court case which we cite, which was

13

affirmed by the Third Circuit without opinion, seemed to

14

have thought that it was accruing from the withdrawal date

15

and not from the end of the prior plan year.

16

I have to agree those opinions are somewhat

17

murky, and so I can understand why Judge Easterbrook may

18

have been confused.

19

Also, I would point out that in none of these

20

cases up till now has interest really been the principal

21

issue in the case.

22

other issues predominated, and so it may be that other

23
