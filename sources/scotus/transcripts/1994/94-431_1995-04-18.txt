ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. LOTZ:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
Petitioner, James D. Ryder, was convicted at a

12

general court martial of several offenses pursuant to

13

Article 66 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

14

case was then automatically appealed to the Coast Guard

15

Court of Military Review.

17

appellate judges and one active duty commissioned officer.

During the course of that appeal, he raised as a

His case was heard there by

19

contention that the judges of that court had not been

20

appointed in accordance with the requirements of the

21

Appointments Clause of the Constitution.

Military Review rejected that contention.

again by that court.
The Court of Military Appeals rejected that

contention on the grounds,

or on the basis of its recent

4

decision in the Carpenter case.

5

of Military Appeals found that the civilian judges of the

or unconstitutionally appointed, but affirmed their

QUESTION:

3

I was just going to ask you, what is

your view as to the validity of the appointment made in
993 in January?

4

MR. LOTZ:

Your Honor, our view is that that

5

appointment is not valid, but that question is not before

6

the Court in this case because the decision at issue here

7

was made before the Secretary's memorandum.
QUESTION:

8

I understand that, but is it not

9

correct that it was made -- was that appointment made

0

before the judgment in this case became final in the sense

11

that all direct review was over?
MR. LOTZ:

12

Well, Justice Stevens, direct review

3

continues, but it was made before the case was decided by

4

the Court of Military Appeals.

5

QUESTION:

It's your view, I gather, then, that

6

even if the valid appointment were made 20 minutes after

7

the case was over it would be too late?

MR. LOTZ:

I'd like to ask you how, under these

view.

21

circumstances, the petitioner was harmed.

The subsequent

22

appointment by the Secretary of Transportation put the

23

very same people back on the court who made the decision,

24

and it's hard to construct any kind of harm to the

25

petitioner here.

Justice O'Connor, the -- this Court's

cases in separation of powers cases have never indicated

that a showing of direct harm is necessary.

10

I can imagine

Here, with an Article I situation, where the

11

very same people are reappointed, it's very hard to

12

understand what the harm might be.

13

MR. LOTZ:

The Freitag decision, also while this

14

Court found the appointments there to be proper, there was

15

a -- as it was put there, the decisions of the special

16

trial judges of the tax court would have been invalid had

they not been properly appointed.

That was also an

The -- this Court's decision in Mistretta

20

21

22

the separation of powers is really an invitation to

23

mischief, to prejudice arising, and furthermore, while

24

this appeal to the Court of Military Review was automatic,

25

it was by no means a pro forma appeal.

1

significant issues raised dealing with the fairness of the

2

underlying court martial.

3

QUESTION:

Well now, at common law, an

4

appointment-related challenge of the kind you're trying to

5

make here as defense to a prosecution would not have been

6

considered justiciable, would it?

7

limited to the bringing of quo warranto, or something of

8

that kind, never allowed as a defense to a prosecution.

9

MR. LOTZ:

It would have been

Currently, under the very old common

10

law, which viewed the holding of an office as akin to a

11

property right, that's correct.

12

view recently in the decisions of this Court, and the

13

decision of the D.C. Circuit Court in the Federal Election

14

Commission v. NRA Political Victory Fund --

15

QUESTION:

That has not been the

But that may be, in fact, what's

16

behind the de facto officer doctrine as such, the notion

17

that when raised as the petitioner did here, it just isn't

18

going to produce an overturning of the conviction.

19

MR. LOTZ:

Well, Your Honor, I think that's the

20

question we're deciding here, whether it will, and we're

21

not talking about an overturning of the conviction,

22

basically an overturning of the appeal where the

23

unconstitutionally appointed judges sat.

24

officer doctrine is really a rule of practicality designed

25

to avoid chaos and mass disruption when a defect in an

1

appointment is discovered long after the fact.
QUESTION:

2

Mr. Lotz, if we're concerned with

3

practicality, then isn't this business about de facto at

4

the middle tier kind of an academic exercise?

5

you have no complaint about the court of first instance,

6

and then there was a review at the third tier, a fully

7

competent court, and the conviction was affirmed, so even

8

if there's an infirmity at the second tier, why should it

9

matter?

10

MR. LOTZ:

After all,

Well, Justice Ginsburg, the review at

11

the Court of Military Appeals by no means corrected this.

12

The Court of Military Appeals is limited to reviewing

13

matters of law.

14

other hand, has much broader powers to review --

15

The Court of Military Review, on the

QUESTION:

Well, can you tie it into this case

16

and tell me what it was that was reviewed as the second

17

tier that was not reviewed on final review?

18

20

MR. LOTZ:

The -- I can't tell you specifically

anything that was not reviewed.
QUESTION:

The --

It's conceivable that the issues were

21

the same, and if they were, then this is kind of a moot

QUESTION:

So then what Justice Ginsburg says

13

would seem to be correct, that if there are only issues of

14

law, you've simply skipped the middle stage.

15

MR. LOTZ:

Well, Your Honor, the statute

16

provides the petitioner with the right to an appeal at the

17

Court of Military Review.

18

that appeal be heard by judges appointed in a manner

19

designed to enhance their quality and their stature, and

that wasn't done here, and --

QUESTION:

The Constitution requires that

Let's put it in a context of Article

22

III courts.

If someone had, let's say, lost in the

23

district court, and raised issues of law on appeal to the

24

court of appeals, and the court of appeals affirmed, then

25

he applied here for certiorari and we also affirmed,

1

surely it would make no difference whether the court of

2

appeals was properly constituted or not, because he got a

3

full review of the same things that the court of appeals

4

reviewed by us, so how could it possibly affect his

5

status?
MR. LOTZ:

6

Justice Scalia, the -- my

7

understanding of the decisions in Glidden and in Freitag

8

indicate that it's -- you don't have to show direct harm.
QUESTION:

9
10

In Freitag it was in the first

instance there was an infirmity.

11

MR. LOTZ:

That's correct.

12

QUESTION:

In Glidden it was a question of an

13

Article III judge at the second tier.

14
15

MR. LOTZ:

Glidden involved two cases.

One was

at the trial level, one was at the court of appeals.

16

QUESTION:

But think of a case, let's say cases

17

in the circuit, and a question is certified, so it comes

18

right here.

19

when we had three-judge courts more often than we do

20

now -- take a voting rights case nowadays, three-judge

21

court, go right to the Supreme Court -- the middle tier

22

seems to be an unnecessary extra in this picture.

23

We have no middle tier.

MR. LOTZ:

Or, in the old days,

Well, Justice Ginsburg, Congress

24

didn't think it was an unnecessary extra and provided for

25

it.

In addition, review of the court --

3

QUESTION:

4

Well, there is no constitutional

right to two reviews, no less than one, right?

5

MR. LOTZ:

That's correct, but it's a statutory-

6

right.

7

not an appeal as of right.
QUESTION:

8

9

But furthermore, the Court of Military Appeals is
That's done on petition only.

Well, Mr. Lotz, did you petition for

review by the Court of Military Appeals in this case?

10

MR. LOTZ:

We did.

11

QUESTION:

And was it granted?

12

MR. LOTZ:

It was.

13

QUESTION:

And what -- do they grant on specific

14

issues, or do they review the same things that you argued

15

to the intermediate court?

16
17

MR. LOTZ:
issues.

Normally they grant on specific

Occasionally, the court will specify.

18

QUESTION:

And what did they do in this case?

19

MR. LOTZ:

They reviewed the issues specified by

20

the petitioner, which in essence were the same issues

21

reviewed by the court --

22

QUESTION:

So you really did get a review by a

correctly constituted court of the same issues that you

raised in the first tier appellate court.

QUESTION:

I suppose you would argue, though,

that as is true with us, that the court of last resort is

MR. LOTZ:

I would absolutely agree with that,

Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

11

12

It always has an impact.

But your remedy would be going back

perhaps to the same panel, or what would you remedy be?

13

MR. LOTZ:

Remedy would be a review anew in the

14

Court of Military Review by constitutionally appointed

15

judges.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

How about these very same judges who

are now constitutionally appointed?
MR. LOTZ:

My position is that they should not

19

review the same case again as they have already given an

20

opinion on the merits of the case.

21

QUESTION:

Would it be unlawful for the -- after

22

all, they are already familiar with this, and it would be

23

least expensive to have the same judges review what they

24

did now that they have the proper appointment.

MR. LOTZ:

It's our opinion that that would be

MR. LOTZ:

There's no

It was just a

Well, Chief Justice Rehnquist, the --

6

in essence, at the earlier appeal they were not

7

constitutionally appointed judges, and in that capacity

8

they issued a decision expressing their opinion on the

9

merits of the case.

I'm sure this Court understands that

10

that's normally inappropriate to then sit as a judge on

11

that same case.
QUESTION:

12

13

15
16

that.

Well, I certainly don't understand

On what are you basing your contention?
MR. LOTZ:

On a prejudgment of the merits of the

case, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, what if three, say, professors

17

sat on a moot court and the question was presented to them

18

and they decided it for the moot court and then later the

19

exact -- they were all appointed to a court of appeals,

20

and later the exact same question comes up in the court of

21

appeals, are they disqualified because they participated

22

in the same thing in a moot court?

23

MR. LOTZ:

No, I don't believe so, Your Honor,

24

but a moot court is by definition an academic exercise,

25

not a real dispute between live parties, so I think that

would be a different situation.
QUESTION:

2

What about when this Court reverses

3

an appellate panel and it has to go back to that same

4

panel, and maybe there was an alternate ground to end up

for the same party?

MR. LOTZ:

I believe that there -- that may be

different in that the -- I'm assuming that the appellate

panel that's reversed was consti -- or composed entirely

9

of constitutionally appointed judges, and their opinion

then is expressed only in their judicial capacity.
QUESTION:

11

Mr. Lotz, I want to go back to

QUESTION:

Then it seemed to me there was an

issue that they decided below in the improperly

didn't decide.

9

MR. LOTZ:

That's correct.

10

QUESTION:

So then we probably would have to

11
12

13
14

reach the issue.
MR. LOTZ:

That's correct, and I apologize for

that misstatement.
The Government is arguing here that this

15

application of the de facto officer doctrine here is akin

16

to pure prospectivity which it claims has never been

17

expressly renounced by this Court, but whatever its

18

application in a civil case seeking injunctive relief like

19

Buckley, it's fairly clear from a reading of Justice

20

Souter's plurality opinion in Beam that that implies or

21

assumes that you can't have juris prospectivity in a

during the proceeding but had waited until after the

appropriate?
MR. LOTZ:

8

Justice Stevens, I'm -- that's not my

I don't represent anyone who's here on habeas

I think a habeas corpus petitioner with the same

MR. LOTZ:

The issue that was not granted review

at the Court of Military Appeals dealt with a contention

20

that the panel, which is the equivalent of the jury,

21

imposed an unduly severe sentence because of the way the

question and that he may have overemphasized the general

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE

14

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

15
16
17

MR. WALLACE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This Court's 1993 decision in Harper v. The

18

Virginia Department of Taxation recognized a distinction

19

between retroactive application of a legal rule as a

20

choice of law matter and remedial issues, a distinction

21

previously discussed in opinions in the American Trucking

22

and Jim Beam cases that were not subscribed to by a

23

majority of the Court.

24
25

In those cases, the distinction was important
because they involved invalid schemes of State taxation,
23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005

1

and the remedial issues implicated questions of State law.
Here, the distinction is important because the

2

3

remedial issues implicate questions of remedial discretion

4

of a Federal appellate court.

5

QUESTION:

But in effect you're -- I think what

6

you're saying is that there is remedial discretion to give

7

no remedy whatsoever, and therefore I don't see how you

8

draw the distinction between prospectivity of remedy and

9

prospectivity of vindication of right.
MR. WALLACE:

10

There -- in particular

11

circumstances there can be occasions when a remedy is not

12

appropriate.

13

discretion of Federal appellate courts is actually

14

something codified and recognized in a familiar provision

15

of title 28 of the code, which was not cited heretofore in

16

the case, but I would like to remind the Court of it, and

17

I notified counsel of it yesterday when in preparation for

18

this argument its relevance became apparent, and because

19

it's not quoted in the papers I'll just read it briefly to

20

the Court, title 21 -- section 2106 of title 28, and it's

21

the ending that seems to us in context to have particular

22

relevance.

23

I mean, the breadth of the remedial

It says:

"The Supreme Court or any other court

24

of appellate jurisdiction" -- and that, presumably the

25

Court of Military Appeals is any other court of appellate
24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005

1

jurisdiction, but it codifies a principle whether that's

2

true or not -- "may affirm, modify, vacate, set aside, or

3

reverse any judgment, decree or order of a court lawfully

4

brought before it for review, and may remand the cause and

5

direct the entry of such appropriate judgment, decree, or

6

order, or require such further proceedings to be had as

7

may be just under the circumstances."

8

9

And it seems to us that the rather clear
implication is when there are reasons to conclude in the

10

circumstances of a particular case that further

11

proceedings would not be just under the circumstances,

12

further proceedings need not as a remedial matter be

13

ordered in that case.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

Well, the Court of Military Appeals

isn't established under title 28, is it?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, I understand that.

I'm

17

looking to this provision as a codification of remedial

18

principles that are inherent in the exercise of appellate

19

authority in any event, and as a guide, rather than as

20

something that necessarily has to apply to the Court of

21

Military Appeals.

22

QUESTION:

Are you saying that this, even as

23

applied to Article III courts this allows selective

24

prospectivity?

25

think selectively we should -- this renders Harper wrong,

That is to say, in a particular case we

is that it?
MR. WALLACE:

2

I would not say it renders Harper

3

wrong at all.

4

looked to are not necessarily selective circumstances, but

5

the circumstances that would warrant pure prospectivity

6

such as the Court has ordered in some of its cases,

7

including Northern Pipeline v. Marathon and Buckley v.

8

Valeo.

9

I would say that the circumstances to be

QUESTION:

I don't see how you get that out of

10

that language.

I mean, it seems to me if the language

11

means what you say it means, it validates selective

12

prospectivity as well as --

3

MR. WALLACE:

4

QUESTION:

5
6

One could make that argument.

One would have to make that argument.

It's the only argument the language allows.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, what is just under the

7

circumstances can be looked at in a more generalized way

8

than the selective prospectivity way of looking at it.

9

The circumstances are not self-defining, that they

20
21

22

necessarily mean selective.
QUESTION:

One way to do that, for example,

would be to recognize a harmless error doctrine as we do.

23

MR. WALLACE:

24

QUESTION:

25

That is correct.

But it's a very far step from that to

say that to sort of deny the old slogan and say yes,

1

indeed, there can be rights absolutely without remedy, and

2

that seems to me the consequence of your argument.

3

MR. WALLACE:

Well, there may be rights without

4

remedy in a particular circumstance, although there would

5

be remedies in other circumstances, and what I would like

6

to suggest here is that there were six factors, six

7

considerations that were before the Court of Military

8

Appeals and that apply to all nine or ten of the pending

9

cases -- this is not a selective matter -- that warranted

10

their conclusion that when there was no other defect in

11

the proceedings there was no need to order relief in this

12

case, and I would like --

13

QUESTION:

Well, one of the consequences of

14

accepting that argument is that no one, I suppose, no

15

party in interest, will ever have an incentive to

16

challenge a valid appointment in these circumstances.

17

MR. WALLACE:

Well, that is in our view, Justice

18

Souter, not the consequence, because anyone who raises an

19

additional issue, as the petitioner here did, would have

20

the incentive to also raise the Appointments Clause issue,

21

because if there were another error or defect in the

22

proceedings that required retrial or remand to the Court

23

of Military Review, certainly then the Court of Military

24

Appeals should say any further hearing should be conducted

1

Government is not taking a position which is pending

2

before the Court.

3

reluctant to comment about the case itself.

I did not hear the argument, and I'm

4

I do think that we should look at the particular

5

circumstances with which the Court of Military Appeals was

6

faced when it determined under Buckley v. Valeo to accord

7

the judicial acts of these two judges with de facto

8

validity for purposes of the cases that were then before

9

it, and there are six considerations that we think

10

justified that in the situation that they were presented

11

with, and it's a rather narrow situation that they were

12

presented with.

13

If I can just recount what these -- the first is

14

that they had already, by the time they rendered the

15

decision, there was already a cure that had been

16

effectuated.

17

that cure, but the Secretary of Transportation had

18

reappointed the same two judges.

19

There can be debate about the validity of

QUESTION:

The second --

It seems to me if you rely on that,

20

you're really asking us to decide whether that was a valid

21

cure or not.

22

MR. WALLACE:

Well, it was an effort to correct

23

the defect that had been found, and to that extent the

public interest consideration required --

was a perfectly obvious ineffective effort to correct it,

2

would it still be satisfactory to you?

3

that's the case, but it seems to me rather strange to rely

on the fact that they tried to cure it if they didn't, in

5

fact, do so.

MR. WALLACE:

I'm not saying

The question is one of statutory authority.

8

QUESTION:

Well, you say --

9

QUESTION:

It's arguably a cure for the future.

10

MR. WALLACE:

Yes, but there's a very

11

substantial argument that these statutes should be

12

interpreted in conformity with the Appointments Clause

13

rather than in a manner that would not enable the

14

responsible officials to comply with the Appointments

15

Clause while still conducting the proceedings that

Congress has authorized.

Once again, the consequence of taking

that as relevant is in effect to say that as long as the

to worry about.

11

with.

There's no other value to be concerned

As long as they get it right, who cares?
MR. WALLACE:

12

Well, but -- but the competence is

13

quite important when you're talking about whether in the

14

absence of other defect there's reason to upset the result

15

of the particular proceeding and redo it.

16

QUESTION:

Yes, but the -- in effect you're

17

saying there just is not an independent value in policing

18

the Appointments Clause by providing the normal incentive

19

for a party like this to raise the issue prospectively,

20

and you're saying that, and implicitly it seems to me

you're saying there just is not a value that outweighs the

merits.

cares?
MR. WALLACE:

2

In light of the adequate incentive

3

to raise the issue along with other issues which the

4

defendant will have if for no other reason than because if

5

he persuades an appellate court that there was more than

6

one error, the appellate court is less likely to say that

7

it's satisfied that the cumulative effect of the errors

8

was harmless.

9

QUESTION:

No, but I would suppose he has even

10

the disincentive on your theory, because if he raises it,

11

as I suppose he ought to do, at the trial level, he has to

12

worry about making all those judges mad, and I suppose

3

that if he knows that he gets nothing independently by

4

raising the Appointments Clause issue, there is in fact an

5

incentive not to raise it.

MR. WALLACE:

operate on the assumption that judges will rise above

Well, we'll be facing the habeas

anyway, unless we prevail in this case, and then the

6

habeas cases would follow a fortiori from it.

comparing these two judges to judges on senior status is

MR. WALLACE:

Of course, but there's a question

here, if you don't follow the normal practice of remanding

it to the same panel, if you specify that there have to be

8

different judges, which can occur here because the

military judges have been rotated, although the same two

So it would be possible, if you

decided that the two who had sat previously should not

review it, still to get a fully constituted panel.

MR. WALLACE:

It would, because the military

service, and there are three new military judges on the

could hear the case.
QUESTION:

It would be possible.
Now, is it -- in the ordinary course

of business, would you ordinarily have the three military

judges constituting a panel, or would there always be a

civilianon the panel?

7

MR. WALLACE:

It can -- the panels rotate, and

8

it can be the three military judges.

In the Navy, Marine,

9

or the Army or Air Force Court of Military Reviews there

10

are no civilian judges, so you always have panels

consisting entirely of active duty officers.

MR. WALLACE:

I don't really know.

I guess that

is the answer, I'm told from a nod of the head, but I do

know that their practice would ordinarily be to go back to

You're not relying at all on anything, any legal

5

of these particular equities of- the case?

7

MR. WALLACE:

Well, we think that the de facto

8

officer doctrine is the backdrop here against which this

9

was a proper exercise of remedial discretion.

10

That

doctrine has been recognized over and over.

11

Strictly speaking, we don't think that that was

12

precisely what was applied in the de facto officer cases.

13

The courts never reached the merits of whether there had

14

been a defect in the appointment.

15

was, as it was in Buckley v. Valeo, that there had been a

16

defect in the appointment but that nonetheless the

17

official acts that have been taken should be accorded de

totally unpersuasive if there was just a mere attempt

2

later on to cure it, and nobody seems to want to argue

3

whether the later appointment did, in fact, cure it.

4

MR. WALLACE:

Well, I would go so far as to say

5

there has to be a substantial basis for believing that the

6

cure was valid.

7

resolved in advance before it's been litigated in the

8

lower courts or briefed and argued in this Court on the

basis of that, and I think we certainly have a substantial

11

I don't think that that question need be

basis for arguing that the cure was effective.
QUESTION:

Let --

Mr. Wallace, before we -- it seems to

12

me there's a real risk for this Court in adopting this

13

kind of an approach that you're urging on us, that we look

14

upon the individual case, and before we apply the doctrine

15

that the officer who rules on a case has to be one

16

properly appointed, at least where the challenge is raised

17

immediately.

18

The problem with your approach is that in some

19

situations it would lead us into confrontations with the

20

executive, where the executive appoints someone who is a

21

close friend, let's say, or one of the reasons for which

22

you have an Appointments Clause, that there is indeed some

23

problem, but you cannot say the individual appointed was

24

incompetent.

1

the Appointments Clause would have provided.

2

In order to protect the person in a case like

3

that, we would have to make an affirmative finding that

4

this person was an unsatisfactory individual, that he had

5

judged the case improperly, was not as good as another

6

judge.

I don't want to have to do that.

7

MR. WALLACE:

Well, I don't say that this case

8

should turn on an assessment by this Court of that kind of

9

question.

10

The question before the Court is whether the

11

Court of Military Appeals, when it resolved a question of

12

first impression that was before that court, namely, that

13

the principle of Weiss that a second commission was not

14

needed cannot be extended to retired military officers,

15

that the question is whether the circumstances that they

16

were dealing with justified their remedial decision that

17

these particular cases need not be reheard because of the

18

circumstances in which they had been heard.

19

QUESTION:

The difficulty that I wanted to ask

20

you about is in -- I haven't read the whole Carpenter

21

opinion, but in the part of it in your brief, the reason

22

that they give for not extending it backwards, it says

23

just as the acts of the FEC Commissioners were accorded de

24

facto validity in Buckley v. Valeo, we hold that judicial

25

acts of the chief judge are entitled to de facto validity.

Now, if that's the reason that they gave, then

2

how can we know whether they would have given some other

3

reason if they'd adopted your theory that you're arguing

4

now?

5

MR. WALLACE:

I think that it is properly looked

6

at as an exercise of remedial discretion in that use of

7

the Buckley case.

8

9

In

984, in a case that petitioner cites in the

D.C. Circuit, an opinion that was joined by then Judge

10

Ginsburg, called Andrade v. Lauer, the court of appeals

11

there described Buckley the following way:

12

discussion of remedies in Buckley did advert to the need

the court's

3

on prudential grounds to avoid interfering with past

4

actions of the commission.

5

however, gives no indication that this was a matter of

6

anything other than ordinary remedial discretion in a case

7

involving reform of an entire institution.

8
9

The court's discussion,

The prospectivity that the Court adopted in
Buckley for its relief, as it did in Cipriano v. City of

20

Houma and in Northern Pipeline v. Marathon, was basically

21

a remedial question rather similar in kind to other

22

aspects of the Court's jurisprudence, where it has held

23

that remedies are not rigid and mechanical, but are

24

adaptable to the circumstances presented.

But you didn't have somebody in the

MR. WALLACE:

That is correct, but even in

injunction jurisprudence the Court has said it's error to

interfere with action in the future, that it doesn't

comply with the statute until the statute has been
