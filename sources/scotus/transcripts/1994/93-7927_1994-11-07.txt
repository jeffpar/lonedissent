CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES S. LIEBMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. LIEBMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
Curtis Lee Kyles is on death row for a robbery-

11
12

murder he steadfastly claims he did not commit, and that

13

his initial accuser, Beanie Wallace, did commit.

14

The issue here is whether the jury had a

15

reliable opportunity to assess the evidence on that

16

identity question, notwithstanding the quantity of

17

evidence that the prosecution suppressed.

18

Both sides agree that the materiality standard

19

of Unitdd States v. Bagley controls.

20

Mr. Kyles' conviction must be overturned if disclosure of

21

the evidence suppressed by the State would have created a

22

reasonable probability of a reasonable doubt in the mind

23

of one or more of the jurors, and a reasonable probability

24

is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the

25

outcome.

Under that standard,

complicated, and I'd like to take a couple of minutes, if

3

I could, to give the background.

resisted a thief in the parking lot of a Schwegmann's

6

face at point blank range, walked to her car, and drove

7

off.

When Dolores Dye

The State's evidence that Kyles was the killer
was in four categories.

First were four eye-witness

10

identification of Kyles as the killer, all of them

11

confirmed by an in-court viewing of Kyles standing side-

12

by-side with Beanie Wallace.

13

Second was the portion of a vinyl roof of a car

14

in a blurry, blown-up photograph of the crime scene which

15

prosecutors argued resembled Kyles' car.

16

Third was physical evidence that the State

17

claimed that Kyles had possessed but Kyles said he did not

18

possess, mainly the victim's Ford LTD which Beanie Wallace

19

claimed'Kyles had sold to him, the victim's purse and

20

personal effects the police found in a large, plastic

21

trash bag outside the Kyles' home, and a gun, the murder

22

weapon, found behind the stove in the Kyles kitchen.

23

And fourth, then, were physical evidence that

24

Kyles admitted possessing, a 2-inch square Schwegmann's

25

receipt with Kyles' fingerprints on it found in the LTD

1

and 15 cans of dog and cat food found in the Kyles'

2

kitchen, some of which matched the brands that the victim

3

bought.

4

Kyles then offered the testimony of seven

5

witnesses tending to show that all of the State's evidence

6

was consistent with Kyles' innocence and Beanie Wallace's

7

guilt.

8

9

First, one of the eye witnesses admitted she
only saw the perpetrator from the side and back and had

10

not identified a photo of Kyles in a photo array, and the

11

other three eye witnesses who had identified Kyles in a

12

photo array admitted that they saw the same picture of

13

Kyles five times before they testified at trial and

14

identified him in court.

15

Second, Kyles himself testified that you

16

couldn't tell the color, make, model, or any attributes of

17

the car in the blurry, blown-up photograph and, in any

18

event, it wasn't his car.

19

Third, defense witnesses testified that they saw

20

Beanie driving the victim's car within an hour of the

21

killing and furtively changing its license plates, that

22

Beanie had the opportunity to plant the purse and gun when

23

he was at the Kyles' home and alone in the Kyles' kitchen

24

on the Sunday prior to the police search on Monday, and

25

then, as to the sales receipt, Kyles testified to hitching

1

a ride with Beanie in the LTD to buy cigarettes and

2

transmission fluid, and as to the pet food, his witnesses

3

testified that the Kyles family kept a cat and a dog, and

4

a police photograph was introduced showing a bottle of

5

Hartz dog shampoo in a closet in the Kyles' home.
As I will shortly show in detail, there are four

6

7

separate reasons why there would have been a reasonable

8

probability of a reasonable doubt if the State had

9

disclosed the evidence it suppressed rather than

10

suppressing and misrepresenting it.

11

First are the suppressed --

12

QUESTION:

13

called at trial?

14

MR. LIEBMAN:

15

trial.

16

called to testify.

17

Before you get onto that, was Beanie

He was not called to testify at

He was present in that courtroom, but he was not

QUESTION:

But you assert that the defendant's

18

main hope for acquittal was that Beanie did it, yet the

19

defense did not call Beanie?

20

MR. LIEBMAN:

That is true, Your Honor, and that

21

is the subject of the ineffective-assistance portion of

22

this claim which has been addressed in the lower courts

23

and is part of the cert petition here, though we did not

24

address in our brief, and that is --

25

QUESTION:

-- purposes we have to assume that

1

that was not incompetent assistance of counsel, I assume?
MR. LIEBMAN:

2

Well, on the Brady claim -- that's

3

right.

4

had the State disclosed the suppressed evidence, the use

5

of that evidence would be the use that competent counsel

6

would make of it, but we assume that it would be the

7

effect of that evidence in the trial.

On the Brady claim, we -- what we assume is that

8

The court below found that a strategically

9

reasonable attorney would not call Beanie Wallace no

10

matter what.

11

of our claim, we disagreed with that, but it is a matter

12

of the determination of the court below, and in fact a

13

number of courts in the State and Federal system have said

14

in this case any attorney wouldn't want to get anywhere

15

near Beanie.

16

he did it and let the jury achieve a reasonable doubt on

17

that basis.

18

Now, on the ineffective assistance portion

You'd want to just present the theory that

I want to talk about the suppressed eye-witness

19

statements.

20

copies, Kyles and Beanie were facially similar in bone

21

structure, profile, coloring.

22

however, the two men clearly and distinctly did not

23

resemble each other.

24

125 pounds, Beanie Wallace a fire plug, 5-foot 5-inches

25

tall, 140 pounds.

As their photos reveal, and I have brought

Stood side-by-side,

Kyles was a maypole, 6-foot tall,

The controlling issue, then, was whether the

1

2

witnesses saw the killer's build as the killer attacked

3

the victim outside her car, or whether they only saw the

4

victim's -- the killer's face when he fled in the victim's

5

car, and on that issue, contrary to the testimony at

6

trial, the suppressed statements show that only one

7

witness got a good look at the killer's height, size, and

8

build, and that witness in a suppressed statement exactly

9

described fire plug Beanie Wallace, not maypole Curtis

10
11

Kyles.
Second, based on the chance discovery of a

12

portion of a car's vinyl roof in the corner of a blown-up

13

photo, the district attorney argued that Kyles' car was

14

parked near the victim -- near the crime scene moments

15

after the killer fled in the victim's car.

16

a verdict premised on this self-described key element --

17

the prosecutor called it a key element of his case -- is

18

undermined by the State suppression of a police memorandum

19

showing'that, if anything, the police knew exactly the

20

opposite of what the prosecution argued, namely that the

21

police did not leave matters to chance, that they

22

systematically listed the license numbers of "vehicles

23

parked in the Schwegmann's parking lots around

24

Schwegmann's on September 20, 1984," and it showed that

25

the petitioner's car was not on the list.

Confidence in

The list was

1

suppressed.
QUESTION:

2

3

I thought the rebuttal to that was

that they didn't list all of the cars.

4

MR. LIEBMAN:

5

QUESTION:

6

7

Your Honor --

Is there a factual dispute about

that?
MR. LIEBMAN:

There is a factual dispute about

8

that, but I don't think it's important.

9

itself disputes the factual finding.

10

Is that --

The memorandum

The factual statement was that they only

11

searched one part of one lot.

12

here are the cars parked in the Schwegmann's lots, plural,

13

at the particular time.

14

and they had 19 cars, and the thought that there were too

15

many cars that three detectives couldn't get more than 6

16

each is a little bit hard to understand.

17

The memorandum itself said,

It was done by three detectives,

Nonetheless, it doesn't matter, because the

18

testimony was that the part of the lot that they did

19

search was in the immediate area of the crime scene, and

20

the picture itself, the blown-up photograph itself, shows

21

the very edge of the crime scene, because there's the

22

police cruiser right there on the edge of the crime scene,

23

and you can see that the only thing that separates the

24

crime scene from the blurry photograph that's obscured is

25

one row of parked cars, so it's in essence the second row

1

of parked cars over.
They took the list down at

2

:15 after the store

3

had closed.

One can predict that this car shown in the

4

photograph would have been probably the closest car.

5

Certainly it would have been one of the closest cars to

6

the crime scene.

7

in the immediate area, but the picture shows that the car

8

in question was in the immediate area,

So the finding was that they only looked

so I don't think it

really matters what we do with that factual issue.
Third, had the State disclosed only its evidence

10
11

about Beanie Wallace, there is also a reasonable

12

probability of a reasonable doubt, for the jury would have

13

seen that most everything the police witnesses testified

14

and that the prosecutors argued about Beanie Wallace was

15

false.

16

otherwise not entirely believable defense witnesses said

17

about Beanie was true, and most importantly, that the

18

police had substantial, affirmative evidence in their

1

files that Beanie Wallace was the killer.

20

It also would have shown that most everything the

Finally, a reasonable probability of a

21

reasonable doubt arises from the suppressed evidence,

22

notwithstanding the only two untainted pieces of evidence,

23

the receipt and the pet food.

24
25

Now for the details, beginning with the eye­
witness identifications, and I'm going to focus here, as

1

did the majority below, on the three identifications that

2

seemed most reliable to the court below, because they were

3

predicated on a photo array.

4

Although similar of face, as I said, as the

5

photographs reveal, maypole Curtis Kyles and fire plug

6

Beanie Wallace were unmistakably different in build, so

7

the State's case depended on the witnesses' opportunity to

8

see the killer before he got in the victim's car.

9

At trial, the testimony claimed that the

10

opportunity was present for the witnesses, and the

11

prosecutor then bragged in summation that "all of them had

12

an excellent opportunity to view the homicide and the

13

person who did it.

14

trapped in a lie."

15

QUESTION:

Nobody changed his story.

Nobody was

Yes, but all we have for it is your

16

word that the two are not recognizable one from the other

No, that's not right, Your Honor.

Yes, the photographs are a part of

numbers, if you'd like the -- Kyles is S-45, trial

3

mug shot has two numbers at trial, either D-4 or S-44.

But it's not only that, every one of the courts

5

below made a determination.

They all tell you, we looked

at the photographs and this is what we saw, and you will

see at the trial court, Fifth Circuit, the district court,

Fifth Circuit opinion.
QUESTION:

There were witnesses who said they

didn't look alike?
MR. LIEBMAN:

There were witnesses who -- no,

5

there were no witnesses who said they didn't look alike.

6

The eye witnesses looked at them side by side and said

7

it's him and it's not him, and I'm sure, but they didn't

8

characterize what it was that led them to that, but of

9

course, if you looked at them you couldn't possibly think

10

that they could be the same person, because one was so

11

much taller than the other.

12

But what the suppressed statements show is that

13

the witnesses, only one witness did have the excellent

14

opportunity that the prosecutor claimed.

15

described Beanie Wallace to the T.

16

did change their stories, and one of them could have been

trapped in a lie if the statement had been released.

That witness

The other witnesses

And let me start with Isaac Smallwood.

On

19

page 35'of our blue brief we have laid out his testimony.

20

He said that he got a good opportunity to see the

21

assailant's build as he watched the assailant shoot the

22

victim, walk, then, he said nonchalantly to the victim's

23

car, get in the car, and drive away.

24
25

This testimony was very important to Smallwood,
because he testified over and over again that once the

1

killer was in the car, he could only see the side of the

2

killer's face and nothing else, but as the State now

3

accepts in his brief, Smallwood's testimony was false.

4

QUESTION:

But isn't it also the case -- isn't

5

it also the case that you were in, or the trial counsel

6

was in just as good a position to go after Smallwood at

7

the second trial as he would have been if the disclosure

8

had been made?

9

MR. LIEBMAN:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. LIEBMAN:

No, that's not true.

Why not?
Because at the first -- you're

12

referring, I assume, to the first trial, the testimony at

13

the first trial to which the State refers in its brief,

14

and the difference --

QUESTION:

The difference between -- that's

his car, walk from the crime scene, the murder scene, and

get into his car, and he was asked, well, how did he walk?

Well, he walked nonchalantly.

trial and, in fact, in the suppression hearing, Smallwood

2

said,

3

him outside the car.

I saw the man outside the car.

I got a good look at

The only thing that was different was whether he

4
5

actually saw the shooting, but of course nobody's

6

disagreeing -- there's no issue about whether there's a

7

shooting and somebody got killed.

8

whether they got a chance to see the man before he got in

9

the car.

The only issue is

In addition, Justice Souter, trial counsel did

10
11

attempt to impeach Smallwood on that minor discrepancy,

12

did he see him from the beginning or only part of the way,

13

and he did it by asking Henry Williams, who was

14

Smallwood's partner, standing right next to him, isn't it

15

true that Smallwood didn't turn around until after the

16

shot was fired, and his partner says no, that's not true,

17

so there was no way to impeach that, because you didn't

18

have the statements which would have permitted that, but

19

the critical point was whether they saw him out of the

20

car.

21
22

23

The same thing is really true, and in
Smallwood's testimony he says -QUESTION:

Well, I -- just to follow up on that

one point, why is it that the first trial testimony was

not wholly sufficient for the impeachment purposes without

the statement?
MR. LIEBMAN:

2

Because the first trial said that

that he saw the assailant outside the car, standing up,

walking, clear shot at him.

The question was, could you see the

They have a similar

In both trials he said yes, I

11

saw him walking from the crime scene to the car.

12

difference is whether he actually also saw the shooting or

13

not, but that did not undermine his capacity, his

14

opportunity to see the difference between the two that

15

makes the two absolutely -- you couldn't mistake them, but

16

you could mistake them in face and that's --

So this made the critical witness Henry

2

Williams, who was, as the district attorney described him

3

as his best witness.

4

witness, and indeed, by all accounts Williams did get the

5

best look at the robbery and shooting, and a few hours

6

later he described the man he saw commit it, and this is

7

the description he gave at page 1 7 of the Joint Appendix:

a black male, about 1

or 20 years old, about 5 foot 4 or

5 foot 5 inches, 140 to 150 pounds, medium build, dark

complexion, and plaited hair, short.
Williams thus gave an identical description of

12

Beanie Wallace.

13

this statement, the police got information and reflected

14

it in a police report that said that Beanie Wallace had

15

committed another murder, and in it they gave Beanie

16

Wallace's height and weight, and it was 5 foot 5 inches,

17

140 pounds, same day.

On that very same day that Williams gave

The description was not of -- and also 21 years

1

old, which is much closer than Kyles, who was a 25-year-

20

old man at the time, 6-foot tall, 125 pounds.

21

So -- and the materiality of Williams'

22

description of a short, stocky killer, like Beanie

23

Wallace, and not a tall man like Curtis Kyles, a tall,

24

thin man, is compounded by the length the State went to

25

conceal it.

Because at a pretrial suppression hearing to

2

identify, the defense counsel asked the chief detective,

3

he said, I know you're not going to turn over the

4

statements to me, but I want to know, tell me "in any

5

single point, were there discrepancies in the physical

6

descriptions given of the assailant," and chief detective

7

Dillman said that the only discrepancy besides a few years

8

in age was 3 inches in height, ranging, he said, from

9

5 foot 8 inches to just under 6 feet, and beyond that he

10

said explicitly, because defense counsel kept pushing, he

11

said there were no other discrepancies.

12

Confidence in the outcome is undermined,

13

whatever might have been the case here had the State

14

offered the identifications and then turned over the

15

witnesses for fair cross-examination, on the basis of the

eye-witness statements.

somebody else had committed it, and to present

MR. LIEBMAN:

1

Your Honor, the reason I am

2

prepared to draw that conclusion, although that's

3

possible, is that State has acknowledged in its brief that

4

it was false, and it seems to me that if the State can

5

draw that inference, I can draw it, but the most important

6

thing, obviously, is that a juror could draw the inference

7

that the contemporaneous statement is the better

8

description than one several months later.
I'd like to move now to the evidence that Beanie

9
10

Wallace pointed the police to that seemed to implicate

11

Kyles.

12

witnesses by saying that it was Beanie who had the car at

13

a time when Beanie said Kyles had it, that Beanie had

14

furtively changed the license plates on it, and that

15

Beanie was in a position to plant the purse and the gun

16

when he visited the Kyles' home and was seen alone in the

17

kitchen.

18

In theory, defense witnesses explained all that

The problem, of course, was that the State

19

impeachdd all of the defense witnesses by showing that all

20

of them were friends of the defendant and two of them had

21

criminal records, and then the State's witnesses

22

resolutely refused to corroborate the defense claims about

23

Beanie, and in cross-examination the prosecutors ridiculed

24

those claims and valorized Beanie Wallace.

25

According to Detective Dillman in testimony, or

Every one of those statements by the prosecutor

testimony of seemingly impeached defense witnesses turned

out to be true, and so the jury was dispossessed not only

20

of evidence that impeached the investigation in the case,

21

the police investigation in the case, but also

22

affirmatively showed that Curtis Kyles did not commit the

killing but that Wallace did.

And if I can give just a couple of examples of
this, the tape reveals that -- and the detectives

He admitted he was in

They asked him, they called him up, as page 262

find out, and he went over to the Kyles home, he left, he

10

called Detective Miller, he went back to the Kyles home,

11

he was there for 2 hours, in the kitchen alone, he leaves,

corner, and they talk about the gun.

So what you have here is evidence that Beanie

knew that he could get in the house, put the gun wherever

18

he wanted, because the police were waiting for him to come

19

out with information about the gun before he was -- they

20

were going to move in.

21

Finally, we have three statements by Beanie

22

which are totally inconsistent with each other in every

23

particular, and what they reveal is a pattern that as each

24

new fact came out that the police knew something, Beanie

changed his story either to pin something more on Kyles or

QUESTION:

-- before you finish that, I ask you

Strickland point.

I take it from your

Everything in your argument seems to

10

indicate that, is that correct?

11

MR. LIEBMAN:

That is correct, Your Honor,

12

because the Brady claim encompasses everything that was

13

lost to the jury by the ineffectiveness claim, but then so

14

much more, the narrow ground for the court, is the Brady

15

claim, because the prejudice analysis is the same.

My other question is there's a

Brecht would enter into the case

Standard.
My position would be that the Bagley standard is

3

sufficiently strong that once you've met the Bagley

4

standard you could also meet the Brecht standard, but

5

that's not really an issue before the Court.

6

Traditionally, the Court lets the lower courts apply

7

harmless error analysis in the first instance, once

8

there's been an error.

9

The issue before the Court is whether there was

10

an error, not whether, if there was, something might

11

follow from that.

12

If I may --

QUESTION:

14
15

17

Mr. Liebman, could you comment on the

dog food evidence?
MR. LIEBMAN:

Yes, I'd be glad to do that,

Justice Stevens.
There are really three things that the State

18

might have wanted to prove with the dog food.

19

was, was it strange that Kyles would have pet food, and

20

the answer to that is on the theory of both parties at

21

trial Kyles' family had an interest in dog food.

22

The first

The Kyles family said they had cats and dogs,

23

and had four witnesses to say it, but the State's theory

24

was that they took eight bags of groceries and threw out

25

everything but the dog and cat food, and of course their

photograph showed the Hartz flea shampoo, so of course

2

there's really no question both sides were claiming that

3

there was a need for dog food in this family.

4

an interest in having dog food in this family.

5

There was

So then the second question becomes, is there

6

something about the brands of dog food that is

7

inculpatory, but there were three brands, actually four

8

brands in interest.

9

the two matching brands that she bought and that they had

There were two matching brands, and

10

were the standard brands, Kal Kan, 9-Lives.

11

bought a third brand, and expensive brand for a finicky

12

cat, but the third brand that the Kyles family had was a

13

cheap brand that she -- there was no evidence that she

14

would ever buy.

15

She, however,

So there were a lot of families in New Orleans

16

on that day who would have Kal Kan and 9-Lives dog and cat

17

food in their house, so maybe it's some evidence, but it

18

certainly doesn't overcome the rest of the defects caused

19

by the suppression.

Finally is Kyles' testimony.

MR. LIEBMAN:

4

Oh, I see.
-- and you can't build a case on

that.

5

QUESTION:

I see.

6

MR. LIEBMAN:

I see.

I see.

Finally is Curtis Kyles' testimony

7

about the food, and all I can say on that, Your Honor, is

8

that if you look at the Schwegmann's advertising manager,

9

he confirmed every specific of what Curtis Kyles said.

10

Kyles said,

I went there, there was a little

11

white shelf tag, the prices were two-for-something, three-

12

for-something, I thought it was on sale, and I bought it,

13

and what the manager said was, small white shelf tag, two-

14

for-something, three-for-something, it wasn't on sale, but

15

we used the multiple price because it made customers think

16

it was cheaper than it otherwise would.

17

So the only discrepancy is that the manager said

18

we used a sales gimmick, Kyles in a sense said I fell for

19

the sales gimmick, but otherwise it's absolutely -- and

20

Kyles is a man of dull normal intelligence in this record,

21

so it makes clear that the testimony was quite the same.

22

I'm going to reserve the remainder.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. PEEBLES:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The issues upon which you granted certiorari

5

include the question of ineffectiveness of representation

6

as well as misconduct and nondisclosed evidence, but the

7

petitioner's brief did not go into the question of

8

Strickland, so I will -- I'll not argue that point unless

9

the Court has some questions on it.

10

The principal issue in this case is whether

11

nondisclosed information by the police in this case would

have created a reasonable probability of a different

13

verdict had it been disclosed.

14

strongly as we can that it would not.

1

Mr. Peebles, before you get into

2

that, is it common ground that there was a duty to

3

disclose the suppressed statements and the information

4

that Mr. Liebman talked about?

5

MR. PEEBLES:

No, Your Honor.

In Louisiana we

6

do not agree that the statements, which were not

7

disclosed, were exculpatory.
QUESTION:

8

In Louisiana, the --

No, but -- excuse me just a minute.

9

If one assumes, just -- I know you disagree with it, but

10

one assumes that they contained impeaching material that

11

might have helped the other side's case, would you agree

12

there would have been a duty to disclose?

13

MR. PEEBLES:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. PEEBLES:

No, Your Honor.

You would not.
As we interpret Bagley, the mere

16

fact that evidence might be favorable, or potentially

17

favorable to the other side, does not create a duty to

18

disclose.

19

The constitutional duty to disclose only arises

20

when the failure to turn over that evidence would create

21

an unfair trial, or would undermine confidence in the

22

outcome of the decision, and one of the footnotes in

23

Bagley, Justice Blackmun, I believe, pointed out that if

24

you required a prosecutor to turn over anything that's

25

potentially favorable, then you create an impossible

1

situation for prosecutors in trying to make that decision.
And in fact I believe that in Bagley they

2

3

expressly rejected the view taken by two of the -- by the

4

dissent in that case which would have created an

5

obligation on the part of the State to turn over anything

6

that was potentially exculpatory.

7

QUESTION:

Well, do you agree that anything that

8

would amount to substantial impeaching evidence in

9

relation to evidence the State had put in would be subject

10

to disclosure?
MR. PEEBLES:

11

I think it should be -- if it was

12

substantially impeaching, I think it should be turned

13

over, Your Honor, as a matter of ethical obligation, and I

14

believe that in this case, had the prosecutors believed

15

that these statements contained substantial impeachment

16

material, they would have turned them over, but whether or

17

not they acted correctly ethically in making their

18

decision not to turn these statements over, we submit that

19

the issue before the Court is whether the Constitution was

20

violated by this action.
QUESTION:

21

When you say, you think they were

22

under an ethical obligation of under some -- you do not

23

say that is the same thing as what the Constitution

24

requires?

25

MR. PEEBLES:

That's correct, Your Honor.

That

is the State's position.
QUESTION:

So that it is not your view that

substantial impeaching testimony would be subject to the

to disclose that information would create a reasonable

you answer that you believe this judgment should be made

MR. PEEBLES:

-- under Brady, it seems to me.
It certainly does not, Your Honor.

10

It makes it difficult for a prosecutor to know, in the

11

perspective that he is faced with when he goes to trial,

12

as to exactly what might become important later on, and

13

that's why we submit that a prosecutor must be given a

certain amount of leeway in making a judgment call of this

type.

16

To come back much, much later and say, well, in

view of the evidence that was presented, you made the

18

wrong decision, I submit that it's not proper to really

call his judgment unethical unless there's a clear showing

that he used very bad judgment and that he did withhold

QUESTION:

Let me put it the other way.

You can

QUESTION:

I don't.

2

MR. PEEBLES:

3

QUESTION:

I submit --

Wasn't Bagley concerned, in that

4

respect, simply with the issue of substantially

5

undermining the verdict, and wasn't that the sense in

6

which Bagley was getting into cumulativeness?

7

MR. PEEBLES:

Yes.

Bagley didn't really speak

8

to the issue of the cumulative effect of the evidence.

9

would suggest that the cumulative effect of the evidence

10

is that which is properly considered would come from the

11

fact that whether due process is violated depends upon

12

whether the defendant received a fair trial, and the only

13

way you can determine whether he received a fair trial on

14

review is to look at all of the evidence.

15

QUESTION:

So on a Brady proceeding, where the

16

prosecution denies it has to turn something over, the

17

trial court does make an evidence-by-evidence ruling, as

18

to whether or not each bit of evidence is inculpatory or

exculpatory?

Yes.

It usually doesn't come up

Precisely.
-- until after the case is over,

and it's so much easier to look at a case after it's over,
especially long after it's over, than it is at the time.
In this case, for instance, there is just no

12

question, I submit from a reading of all of the

13

transcripts, that these prosecutors did a conscientious

14

job, and they never considered Beanie to be a suspect in

this case, and they never considered these statements to

present a substantial conflict insofar as the evidence

that they presented was concerned.

So there might well be a Brady

violation, even though there was no -- as you were saying

earlier, there was no unethical conduct on the part of a

MR. PEEBLES:

12

If by a Brady violation you mean

13

the obligation to turn over anything that is of potential

14

value to the defendant, we -- our argument is that if you

15

want to define the Brady violation that way, that's fine.

16

But from the standpoint of determining whether

17

the denial or refusal to turn over this information is a

18

violation of the defendant's constitutional rights, the

1

criterion set up for doing that in Bagley is to look at

20

all of the evidence, determine whether or not the

nondisclosure of this evidence created a reasonable

Now, in the statement that was taped, they asked

statement which would challenge his ability to recognize

The identification was not in question there.

Of course, driving by in a car, you

1

They are saying that because there

had been one prior trial, which it ended in a mistrial,

3

and there had been prior pretrial hearings in which Kyles

had appeared in court and was seen by these witnesses,

that this -- this influenced them in deciding at this

MR. PEEBLES:

I would rephrase it, Your Honor,

8

to say that it would be more difficult to determine the

9

height of a person in the car.
If I may suggest to Justice Kennedy, the fact is

10
11

that within 4 days after this trial, though, aside from

12

the court appearances, the police presented eye -- I'm

13

sorry, photographic line-ups to these people, and

according to the testimony at the pretrial hearings, the

witnesses immediately and without hesitation picked out of

this photographic line-up Kyles.

That was their conscientious conclusion.

MR. PEEBLES:

I think -- I would suggest that

10

probably that is a conclusion that could be drawn by a

rational person.
That's why I think the State steered clear of

12

13

presenting Beanie as a conscientious person that we could

14

rely upon.

15

make his character a witness, as a subject of the case,

the jury to believe Beanie.

We didn't call him as a witness.

The only time Beanie's name was mentioned was

When the police came to Kyles' house, they

found not only the weapon, but they found a holster for

the weapon in a separate room, they found bullets that fit

the weapon in a separate dresser drawer, they found a

number of these things, which indicated that Kyles

possessed this weapon, and that it would have not been

easy for all this to be planted.
But in -- not just the weapon, the petitioner is

9
10

claiming that Beanie planted the lady's purse in Kyles'

11

garbage.

12

In order to do this, Kyles, according to the

13

theory of the petitioner, Beanie would have had to tell

14

the police on Saturday you better check his garbage, and

15

then, before the police checked the garbage on Sunday,

Kyles -- I'm sorry, Beanie would then have had to go to

Kyles' house the next day and plant the evidence.

MR. PEEBLES:

QUESTION:

The police knew he was.

This is

another thing the police didn't tell the prosecutor.
MR. PEEBLES:

The police said that they -- the

7

police contact with this man was Detective Miller, and

8

Detective Miller didn't even inform his -- the principal

9

homicide detective in this case of most of the things that

10

he did with his informant.

11

police operate with informants, and that's not to say the

12

State shouldn't be held responsible for everything the

13

informant tells the police, but that's simply the

14

situation here.

15

That seems to be the way that

Now, with regard to the pet food, that is,

16

again, a fairly minor part of the State's case.

17

is, though, that when the police came to the Kyles'

18

apartment, they found stacks of Kal Kan dog food and 9-

19

Lives cat food, and that just happened to be the same kind

20

of cat food and dog food that the victim traditionally

purchased, so testified her husband.

case was eye-witness identification, which was strong and

2

was never broken, in spite of vigorous cross-examination.

3

The argument of the petitioner here that the

4

witnesses only saw the defendant or the petitioner from

5

the side, and that sort of thing, we submit is taking a

very narrow view of what these witnesses saw.

7

The fact is that they saw this petitioner from

drew off the lot and onto the highway and then even waited

for a red light before he finally escaped beyond.
