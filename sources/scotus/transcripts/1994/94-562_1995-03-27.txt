ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. ORLANDO

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. ORLANDO:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The heart of the issue before the Court today is

12

the use of the word "may" in the context of the Federal

13

Declaratory Judgment Act, which provides that the Federal

14

courts may declare the rights and other legal relations of

15

any interested party seeking such declaration.

16

We contend that the word "may," as used in that

17

context, means three things and only three things.

18

first is the literal connotation of the word, such that

19

the Federal courts may grant the relief requested and make

20

a declaration, the second meaning is that the court may

21

grant the declaration provided there is a justiciable

22

controversy, and the third meaning, the final meaning, is

23

that the court may grant the relief provided the case does

24

not fall within the category of cases presenting

25

exceptional circumstances as described by this Court's

The

1

2

Colorado River doctrine.
The present analytical framework of the Fifth

3

Circuit Court of Appeals fails in the third respect, and

4

that is, it gives no balancing of the guidelines that were

5

established in Colorado River and Moses Cone against the

6

virtually unflagging obligation of the district court to

7

accept jurisdiction of the case, and that is precisely the

8

fatal flaw in the Fifth Circuit's approach.

9

The majority of the circuits around the country

10

have adopted the Colorado River-Moses Cone analytical

11

framework, and that seems to be working well with the

12

district courts.

13

have been established as the six factors to be considered

14

in such cases, they balanced those factors, weighed it

15

against the concept that jurisdiction is virtually

16

unflagging, and they either decide

17

They are able to use the factors that

QUESTION:

May we just go back to that.

We're

18

dealing with a request for a declaratory judgment.

19

my understanding, as I think it was Borchard's, who wrote

20

the act, that a declaratory judgment, that that is a

21

matter within the discretion of the trial court, that

22

there is jurisdiction, but it need not be exercised.

23

That's the way the author of the act described it.

24

what the notion of a declaratory remedy is.

25

too iffy, the court says we won't handle it, for any of a

It was

That's

Well, if it's

1

variety of reasons.

2

is?

3

Isn't that what a declaratory action

MR. ORLANDO:

Yes, Your Honor, I agree with you,

4

and I agree that that's what Mr. Borchard's understanding

5

of the remedy was as well, is that a new Federal remedy

6

was being created.

7

It was something that at that point in time the

8

Federal courts would not have had the ability to decide a

9

case that just sought a declaration, because there was no

10

Federal remedy along those lines, but the heart of the

11

issue is that there must be a distinction between the

12

exercise, the threshold question of the exercise of

13

jurisdiction versus the granting of the equitable remedy

14

being sought, and the petitioners herein do not contend

15

that granting of a declaration is mandatory.

16

of the statute is contrary to that.

17

that there is discretion to grant the declaratory

18

judgment.

19

QUESTION:

The wording

What we do contend is

But isn't -- doesn't it make sense to

20

infer that there is a derivative or implicit discretion to

21

determine whether to go ahead and have a trial on the

22

issue, because let's assume we apply Colorado River, Moses

23

Cone, or any other set of criteria.

24

the threshold says it's perfectly clear that this is a

25

case in which it's quite unlikely that we would, in fact,

If the court right at

1

grant relief, that is a very good reason for the court at

2

that stage to say, we therefore are going to abstain.

3

doesn't -- why isn't that a sensible way to give practical

4

effect to the discretion that you concede?
MR. ORLANDO:

5

Why

Your Honor, I agree with you that

6

that is a sensible way.

7

petitioners have with the way things are happening in the

8

Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is that what is essentially

9

unfettered discretion is given to the district judge to

The only disagreement that the

QUESTION:

Well --

QUESTION:

But --

13

MR. ORLANDO:

14

QUESTION:

15

Your reference to unfettered discretion I think

-- question.

May I just ask one other?

16

sort of takes its significance from the fact that you

17

continue to reiterate throughout your argument that you

18

have here this morning that there is this unflagging

19

obligation to exercise discretion, which I took you to

20

mean was something inconsistent with abstention, absent an

21

overwhelming case for abstention, and that really is not

22

so.

23

If, in fact, there is the derivative discretion

24

that I was talking about, then we are not in a situation

25

in which there is this unflagging obligation as we are in

1

the circumstances which Moses Cone and Colorado

2

specifically addressed.
MR. ORLANDO:

3

Well, Your Honor, beginning with

4

the Brillhart case, which essentially is the respondents'

5

touchstone in this matter, which seemed to give very wide

6

discretion to the district court on the very threshold

7

issue,

8

Court said that you can decide these - - you can abstain or

9

use discretion, but it's only in,

the very next term ,in the Winter Haven case,

I believe the words

10

were,

11

circumstances, and so in the very --

the extraordinary case,

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. ORLANDO:

14

Yes, Your Honor, the Winter Haven

case was a declaratory judgment case.
QUESTION:

16

MR. ORLANDO:

18

or the exceptional

Was that a declaratory judgment case?

15

17

this

With no other relief sought?
I believe injunctive relief was

sought in that case as well.
QUESTION:

Has this Court ever said what you're

19

contending,

20

when you go through the whole trial you stop because you

21

have discretion with respect to the remedy?

22

doesn't make any sense.

23

that you must exercise the jurisdiction but

MR. ORLANDO:

That just

No, Your Honor, I don't believe

24

the Court has said that, and that's -- I want to make it

25

clear, that is not our position in this case.

Our

1

position is that what we merely seek is that this Court

2

declare to the Fifth Circuit that the Colorado River-

3

Moses Cone analytical framework should apply.

4

QUESTION:

Well --

5

QUESTION:

Well --

6

QUESTION:

-- but did the district court, or the

7

circuit court in this case, ever purport to be abstaining?
MR. ORLANDO:

8

9
10

11

Not from the literal sense of the

word "abstention," which I take to mean dismissal, Your
Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, it seems to me that in your

12

argument so far you have talked about the discretion not

13

to grant declaratory relief as if it were abstention, and

14

it seems to me those are very different things.

15

Now, it may well be that many of the factors you

16

look to with the abstention determination parallel the

17

factors that you look to with reference to declaratory

18

relief, but I suggest that perhaps the one factor that is

19

not present in declaratory relief is a virtual unflagging

20

obligation, and it seems to me that you are conflating in

21

all of your discussions so far abstention and failure to

22

grant declaratory relief in the sound discretion of the

23

court, and that those are analytically two quite separate

24

foundational principles for the court to consider.

25

MR. ORLANDO:

Again, Your Honor, I do contend

1

that it is a threshold question.

2

before this Court contending that the Colorado River-

3

Moses Cone analysis is not a threshold issue.

4

it is.

5

in the very first instance, on a motion to dismiss by a

6

respondent should go through the analysis of looking at a

7

given set of standards and say, either this case should be

8

dismissed or stayed based on the guidelines as set by this

9

Court, and --

10

We're not standing

I believe

It is something that the court, the district court

QUESTION:

To follow up on Justice Kennedy's

11

question, does your answer suggest that the court should

12

treat a dismissal as exactly the same way as staying?

13

MR. ORLANDO:

Yes, Your Honor.

In this

14

instance, where we're referring to parallel State court

15

proceedings as being the basis for such an abstention or

16

stay, as the court in Moses Cone noted, the effect of a

17

stay when you're dealing with parallel State court

18

litigation is, practical consequences, the same thing as a

19

dismissal because of the res judicata effect.

20

QUESTION:

Well, I suggest to you again that the

21

court did not say, and I don't think you can interpret its

22

opinion as saying, that it was abstaining.

23

MR. ORLANDO:

The court -- unfortunately, Your

24

Honor, what's happening is the lower courts, the circuit

25

court opinions as well as the district court opinions, do

1

terribly confuse just the very pure abstention doctrine

2

versus the prudential deference, as some of the cases

3

refer to it as, in the Colorado River Moses Cone analysis.

4

And I would ask the Court that it adopt this,

5

what I would term prudential deference, in the same

6

situation of a declaratory judgment remedy with a

7

diversity based case, and that's what this Court is

8

presented with here today, is the basis for Federal court

jurisdiction is purely diversity, do not have a Federal

11
12

13

question involved in this case, and under that -QUESTION:

Do you want us to say there is an

unflagging obligation to grant declaratory relief?
MR. ORLANDO:

No, Your Honor.

That is not what

14

I'm asking.

15

that there is a virtually unflagging obligation to

16

exercise jurisdiction unless there are exceptional

17

circumstances in which the Court can either abstain or

18

defer to the State court.

19

What I am asking the Court to do is to say

QUESTION:

I think we're back where we started.

20

You're saying there's an unflagging obligation to assert

21

jurisdiction, although once it asserts jurisdiction you

22

can then say, however, we don't think this is an

23

appropriate case for a declaratory judgment, get out of

24

here, right?

25

MR. ORLANDO:

That -- yes, Your Honor, I agree,

because that is what the Colorado River

QUESTION:

So what do you gain by that?

3

MR. ORLANDO:

4

QUESTION:

Well, that is --

You gain simply the statement we - -

5

instead of saying, we don't think this is an appropriate

6

case, get out of here, the court must say, we think this

7

is an appropriate case for us to take jurisdiction, but

8

not to grant relief, get out of here.

9

a lot for your clients on - MR. ORLANDO:

10

Have you really won

Your Honor, the practical effect

11

of telling the lower courts, though, that they may simply

12

elect not to take a declaratory judgment case for any

13

reason at all as long as it's not bias or prejudice, means

14

that we have effectively done away with a declaratory

15

judgment -QUESTION:

16

Well, I thought that answer just

17

contradicts what were you telling Justice Souter.

18

thought you were telling Justice Souter that you were not

going to make them go through that extra step of saying we

have jurisdiction but we're not going to give you a

I thought you said that that doesn't make any

Honor. What I meant in response to Justice Ginsburg's

through a trial process.
QUESTION:

I thought Justice Ginsburg --

But maybe a summary judgment process.

3

In other words, time has got to be spent evaluating

4

perhaps uncontested facts, but time has got to be spent

5

doing something more than would be done if you simply say

6

at the threshold point, get out of here.

7

MR. ORLANDO:

No, Your Honor, I do not believe

8

so, because as this Court did, as Judge Hittner did, we

9

had to have a hearing, an oral hearing on the motion to

10

dismiss, and all that the petitioners are requesting

11

herein is that at such time as the district court takes up

12

the motion to dismiss, that he consider that he has a

13

virtually unflagging obligation to accept the

14

jurisdiction, but that in exceptional circumstances he may

15

either abstain completely or defer to the State court.

16

QUESTION:

To what extent is what you're saying

17

inconsistent with the statement, there is nothing

18

automatic or obligatory about the assumption of

19

jurisdiction by Federal court in a declaratory judgment

20

action even if the parties are proper and the

21

jurisdictional amount is present.

22

jurisdiction over the case and the propriety of exercising

23

that jurisdiction must be borne in mind.

25

The distinction between

Those are Borchard's words about the statute
that he largely composed.

that.
MR. ORLANDO:

2

Well,

I do agree from the

3

standpoint that we're not asking the Court to make an

4

initial ruling on the merits when considering whether or

5

not to defer or abstain.

6

7

under a certain set of guidelines, and I believe Borchard

8

in some of his writings also presaged some of the

9

guidelines that the court should use, and although I don't

All that must be done is an

10

know that he predicted the six that came out of the

11

Colorado River-Moses Cone analysis very well --

12

QUESTION:

Why must you go through a checklist,

13

instead of saying, here's a case where the insurer is

14

suing first, and then you have another case where the

15

insured is coming into court,

16

there are more parties in the State court action, and the

17

one thing that you shouldn't have is wasting judicial

18

resources by having two courts deal with the same matter

19

at the same time,

20

right?

21

wait.

22

there's no Federal question,

so one court should defer to the other,

It's just simply a question of which one should

MR. ORLANDO:

Well, the main reason that you do

23

force some sort of guidelines onto the district court is

24

because if you do not do that, Your Honor, then

25

essentially you have unfettered discretion, and that's our

1

big squabble today, is that we contend that the district

2

courts should not have unfettered discretion.

3

QUESTION:

Do you agree that a fundamental point

4

is, you should not have two lawsuits over the same matter

5

going on at the same time, unless there's extraordinary

6

reason for that?

7

MR. ORLANDO:

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes, Your Honor, I would --

All right, and then the decision has

to be made which of the two lawsuits, and what are the --

10

we have two lawsuits going on now.

11

that you say should control whether the Federal court suit

12

stops and lets the State go forward, or whether the State

13

should stop and let the Federal suit go forward?

14

MR. ORLANDO:

What are the standards

Your Honor, the -- our contention

15

is that the Colorado River-Moses Cone analytical framework

16

should be used in precisely that fashion.

17

we ask.

18

cases makes, in his discretion, the -- an order stating

19

that his court should either abstain completely or defer

20

to the State court, then we wouldn't be here today, and

21

that's precisely what's happening throughout the majority

22

of the district courts around the country today, but just

23

not in the Fifth Circuit.

24
25

That's all that

If the district court in reviewing that line of

can say what you've just said, we should go forward, but

then can immediately say, having gone forward we find that

2

all things considered it's better for the State court to

proceed than it is for us to proceed, and therefore on the

merits we decline the declaratory judgment.

It's a lot more restrictive of the

I believe so, Your Honor.

I

believe that because the declaratory judgment statute, the

grant of a declaration is essentially an equitable remedy,

Not on that alone, Your Honor,

only because that would have been just one of the factors

that the Court has said in the Colorado River and Moses

20

In spite of the discretion granted by

MR. ORLANDO:

Yes, Your Honor, because the

discretion that's granted by the statute itself is the

22

discretion to decide the merits of the case.

23

The statute itself, from just a literal reading

24

of the statute, does not mention the word "jurisdiction."

That statute is merely the creation of a Federal

2

3

remedy, and that got back to my opening statement, Your

4

Honor, that I believe that the only proper way to

5

interpret that language of "may" declare the rights is

6

that threefold test, that you literally can declare the

7

rights, you have to go through the justiciability

8

analysis, you can't grant the declaration if it's not a

9

justiciable controversy, and also, you don't have to grant

10

the relief if you go through the Colorado River-Moses Cone

11

analysis -QUESTION:

Mr. Orlando, now Moses Cone, that was

not a declaratory judgment action, was it?

MR. ORLANDO:

MR. ORLANDO:

The Will v. Calvert case, Your

3

Honor, which was decided just a couple of years after --

4

it was in between Colorado River and Moses Cone, there

5

were four justices that were led by the chief justice in

6

the plurality opinion which sent the case back down, as I

7

recall, but the fifth justice, Mr. Justice Blackmun, voted

8

with the other four justices to state very specifically

9

that the Colorado River analysis should apply.

10

So we did have five justices -- even though

11

there were three separate opinions in that case, five of

12

the justices post Colorado River said no, we need to apply

13

the Colorado River analysis.

QUESTION:

MR. ORLANDO:

That is the precise question

before this Court - QUESTION:

Exactly, and I would like to know why

that doesn't present the better point of view.
MR. ORLANDO:

It doesn't present the better

21

point of view for a couple of reasons.

22

perhaps the most important is just the pure separation of

23

powers between Congress and the legislative branch.

3

MR. ORLANDO:

That's

Yes, Your Honor, the Congress did

give discretion, but again, I would reemphasize that our

5

position is that that discretion was to grant the relief,

6

not to accept jurisdiction.

7

and there are some cases -- I can't recall the name of any

8

that this Court has said, but I'm almost certain there is

9

Supreme Court precedent for the authority that the

Congress, it is very clear,

10

declaratory judgment statute is a remedial statute, that

11

it doesn't say anything about jurisdiction, and while it

12

is a discretionary remedy, there are lots of Federal

13

discretionary remedies, injunction relief, though really

14

our position is that there is no reason to treat the

15

discretionary relief, the equitable type of relief being

16

stated from a declaratory judgment versus any other type

17

of equitable relief that this Court --

QUESTION:

You know, one of the ironies of the

19

issue is, we talk about Colorado River as unflagging

in that case itself, and one of the factors that Justice

22

Brennan mentioned in the -- in his opinion under all these

necessary -- you don't know which one is the heaviest and

2

how to weigh them, but I don't know why, even within the

3

Colorado River formulation, one couldn't say that a

4

district judge has some discretion to decide whether,

5

given the case going forward in two different court

6

systems, which one is a better forum for adjudicating the

7

merits.
MR. ORLANDO:

8

9

Part of the problem with that

approach, Your Honor, is that if this Court does not give

10

some guidance to the lower courts as to which factors

11

should or should not be looked at by the district court,

12

then in essence the Court is granting unfettered

13

discretion, and what is or may happen is the district

14

court may simply look at his docket and say, my docket is

15

overcrowded with criminal cases --

16

QUESTION:

Well, supposing he looks at the

17

docket and says, if I take -- keep this case, I'll be able

18

to try it in about 30 months, it will probably go to trial

19

next week in the State court, and that's the only factor I

20

look at.

21

Is that a sufficient factor?
MR. ORLANDO:

If that's the only factor, then I

22

would say no, Your Honor.

Although it is a fairly

23

compelling factor in and of itself, if the Court didn't

look at some of the other reasons why the case might

properly be in Federal court, then it would be our

QUESTION:

Mr. Orlando, you answered Justice

4

O'Connor that that is indeed the issue here, whether we

should use as a jurisdictional issue what we have said to

be the basis for a merits determination under declaratory

judgment actions, but is that really the issue?

The

dismissal, although the order is not worded specifically

reading of the order, as well as the Fifth Circuit

that exercising jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief

MR. ORLANDO:

"Thus, the court finds

QUESTION:

What is the merits?

I mean, the

the fundamental thing that we start with in these days of

Now, many of the factors that the

we have before this Court today is merely a question of

2

statutory construction, no more, no less.

3

The question before this Court is, does the

4

Declaratory Judgment Act mean what it says when it says

5

"may" as oppose to "must" declare rights, and are we going

6

to engraft on this statute some requirement that the

7

discretion can only be exercised after there is some

8

hearing on the merits, whatever that means?

9

The issue before this Court is made simpler, it

10

seems, because it comes on the heels -- not on the heels,

11

after the decision in Brillhart some 50 years ago, which I

12

believe has already answered the question of statutory

13

construction for this Court.

14

Justice Frankfurter clearly held that the

15

discretion was vested in the district court by this

16

statute to have the discretion not to exercise

17

jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment act, particularly

18

when there is a State court proceeding that can resolve

as the Court here said, jurisdiction to grant the -- this

it?

MR. POWERS:

It is very subtle, and picking up

on a point that was made earlier, it may be that we're

talking semantics more than anything else.

QUESTION:

MR. POWERS:

Is the decision not to exercise

even more conclusively to a conclusion by this Court that

2

in the absence of some legislative response to the earlier

decision, that we should interpret the statute as it was

interpreted by Justice Frankfurter.

5

Now, whether that means it's a jurisdictional

issue, or it's simply a decision not to grant the relief,

7

how that is handled semantically, it probably would be a

8

pure, a logically pure reasoning to say it's

nonjurisdictional, that it's simply a question of

interpreting the statute and denying the relief under --

with the discretion of the court.

QUESTION:

Isn't it just the difference between

12b(1), which would be subject matter jurisdiction, and

12b(6) doesn't state a claim for relief?

MR. POWERS:

I think so.

I think so, but I also

16

think you could probably run a Rule 56 motion and get to

the same result.

18

earlier why that should make a difference whether you run

a Rule 56 motion, a summary judgment motion saying that

20

because of these parallel proceedings you should not

exercise jurisdiction here, or you should not grant the

relief because there's another forum better suited to

23

grant complete relief with all the parties.

Rule 56, and surely we're not here in this Court because

2

it was a Rule 12 motion as opposed to a Rule 56 motion

3

that was filed below, but either of those two provisions

4

would, of course, accord the same relief.
QUESTION:

5

Maybe the stay result in the district

6

court is like if you grant a motion, a forum non

court wants to make sure that that other litigation really

9

goes forward before dropping the case.

If it's

10

reinstituted there may be a statute of limitations

11

question.

Maybe that was the logic behind the stay.
MR. POWERS:

12

I think so, but I'm not so sure you

13

have a statute of limitations issue with a declaratory

judgment action in this case, but that would be - - that is

typically one of the reasons for staying instead of

Well, the purpose of a declaratory

judgment action, as I understand it, is that before a

10

party breaches a contract, before they engage in conduct

11

that might be a breach of contract, and thereby expose

12

themselves to the damages that flow from that, that they

13

would go to court to seek a declaration of what the

14

contract -- contractual rights and duties are.

15

That's the classic example of why you would use

16

a DJ, and that often happens in the insurance industry.

17

An insurance carrier decides to defend, even though they

18

think there's no coverage, and then they simultaneously --

19

before they breach a contract they simultaneously seek a

20

declaration of their rights as to whether they have a duty

21

to defend.

22

In this case, the carriers had already decided

23

to deny defense.

They had already breached the contract,

24

if they indeed had breached it, so there was no need to

25

seek a declaration with respect to that issue.

Your Honor knows, you cannot use the declaratory judgment

the Winkler County action is ultimately resolved, either

by affirming the trial court's judgment, or modifying it,

or remanding it and retrying it, whatever happens, it's

impossible to know whether there will ultimately be a duty

to indemnify under the insurance contracts, so why are we

Of course, isn't there another factor

MR. POWERS:

QUESTION:

2

MR. POWERS:

It seemed like a nice argument to me.
Well, it's a nice argument.

They

3

have a remedy for that, and so the issue that you're

4

addressing, and that is, are we doing disservice to the

5

Constitution by creating an impediment to a foreign

6

interest seeking relief from a Federal court, the answer

7

is no.

removal statutes apply, they will apply, and if the

9

foreign interest has truly a right to be in Federal court,

10
11

The answer is, they have removal statutes.

that right will be afforded.
QUESTION:

But how can they remove, because as I

12

understand it, the State court suit doesn't have

13

complete -- there isn't complete diversity, and there's no

14

basis that you could -- one defendant could get out and

15

get into Federal court.

16

MR. POWERS:

And the answer to that, again, is

17

in the Framers of the Constitution and in the Congress.

18

mean, the district courts are creatures of legislation,

19

and the legislation makes clear that you have to have

20

complete diversity, so I guess the answer to the question

21

is, no, they can't remove the case because there isn't

22

complete diversity, but then it was never envisioned that

23

litigants could petition the Federal court where there

24

wasn't complete diversity.

statutes are written.

1

2

believe -- I suppose there's one thing I should pick up if

3

I can, Justice Ginsburg, because I want to stress that we

4

should not divorce rules of law from practicality, and

5

there is nothing more egregious than two courts racing to

6

judgment with the same controversy.

7

There is nothing that creates more waste.

There

8

is nothing that creates more animosity between two systems

9

of justice, a State system and a Federal system of

10

justice.

11

frequently where, whenever one litigant in the race to

12

judgment is displeased with a ruling by that judge, he

13

runs to the other forum and tries to pit one court against

14

another court.

15

I've been there.

I've seen it, and you see it

It's not only a waste of resources, it's

entirely unseemly, it seems to me, and absent

17

extraordinary circumstances there is no reason for a

18

Federal court to be acting in a purely declaratory manner

19

when you have a pending State court action that can fully

20

resolve the issues.

As was noted by one of the justices earlier,

somebody has to give.

Somebody has to give, and Congress
