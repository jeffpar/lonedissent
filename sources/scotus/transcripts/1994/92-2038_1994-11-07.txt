ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD L. STANLEY

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STANLEY:

10
11

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case is here from the United States Court

12

13

of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

14

this case is how much of a farmer's crop in a protected

15

novel plant variety can be sold as seed under the terms of

16

section 2543 of title VII in the Plant Variety Protection

17

Act.

18

The dominant issue in

That act provides exclusive rights to breeders

19

of sexually reproduced plants.

20

specific and limited exemptions from the acts of

21

infringement that are set forth in section 2541 of the

22

same title.

23

Section 2543 provides

The text of sections 2541 and 2543 can be found

24

at adjoining pages 40a and 41a of the petitioner's

25

appendix in Asgrow's petition for certiorari.

Will you repeat the pages number

It's 40a and 41a of the

petition for certiorari.

QUESTION:

7

MR. STANLEY:

8

Yes.

Thank you.
They're also at pages la and 2a of

the merits brief, but they're not on facing pages.
In construing section 2543, the Federal Circuit

9
10

held that qualified farmers could sell up to 50 percent of

11

their crop to others for use in reproductive purposes.

12

other words, to use it as seed.

13

section 2543 does not support that interpretation,

17

2543, the right to save seed crop exemption section,

18

there's a "provided" part of the sentence that says,

19

"provided," and then there's a sentence following that.

20

Do I understand that Congress has now amended this statute

21

and taken that proviso out?

22

MR. STANLEY:

All right, on October 6 Congress

23

amended the first sentence of 2543 and removed everything

24

after the word -- outside the word provided through the

25

end of the sentence, such that the first sentence now ends

QUESTION:

And that takes effect not

retroactively, but sometime in the future?
MR. STANLEY:

4

Right.

It's a prospective

amendment.

It applies to those certificates that are

applied for on the effective date of the act, which is 180

7

days after the day it was passed.

Yes.

Does it continue to read, "or for

Before you get into that, just one

14

more question about the amendment.

15

the two remaining sentences after the proviso has been

16

deleted did allow some sales of seed, so that there still

17

is some room for the sale as provided -MR. STANLEY:

18

Right.

Is it not true that

The second sentence allows

19

the sale of the protected variety to be used for

20

nonreproductive purposes.

21

basically, between -- which isn't always consistent, the

22

statute between basically using a variety as a crop and as

23

a seed.

A seed is what is planted, used to reproduce the

24

variety.

When the soybean, the variety at issue in this

25

case, is sold for crop, it's sold to a meal-maker or

Other varieties under the act which this act

11

obviously applies to, the distinction of saving seed is an

intentional act.

something like celery or tomatoes, the plant has to be

15

allowed to go to seed.

16

the tomato or the celery stalk, no longer is marketable

for consumer reasons.

is an intentional act, because you had to let the seeds

aside all the seed he has and decide later what he wants

He saves seed because he isn't sure how many

acres he wants to plant next year in soybeans, and how

much he might need would depend on that, or he might think

the price was going to go up, and if he saved the soybeans

he'd get more later.

for saving seeds.

10

I suppose there are a lot of reasons

MR. STANLEY:

There's a lot of reasons for

11

saving soybeans.

12

by itself, the saving of seed is not an act of

13

infringement.

14

farmer saves seed and sells seed, and sells seed above the

15

amount that Congress set forth in the statute that was the

quantity that he could save.

Right.

QUESTION:

At the time of sale.

2

MR. STANLEY:

3

QUESTION:

Right.

And the Federal Circuit, in deciding

4

this case, placed a lot of emphasis on the word, marketed,

5

didn't it, in the exception (3), is it, in 2541?

6

MR. STANLEY:

Right.

The Federal Circuit

7

defined the term,

8

marketing as being selling, but only selling that involved

9

advertising and sales representative or concentrated

10

"marketing" very narrowly, and construed

marketing aspects.

11

QUESTION:

And do you say the term,

12

necessarily includes selling?

13

MR. STANLEY:

14

QUESTION:

15

Yes.

Then it's -- marketing should be the

broader term - -

16

MR. STANLEY:

QUESTION:

MR. STANLEY:

It's marketing --- not the selling.
It's marketing -- marketing at a

minimum includes selling.

I mean, is that what it turns on?

MR. STANLEY:

If you agree with that, that

QUESTION:

2

May I interrupt you there?

I'm not

3

sure how you get the amount from that, because if there

marketing,

Now, we might very well say, or a jury might

9
10

very well say,

11

perfectly well he must have planted with that intent.

12

must have sexually multiplied with that intent, and they

13

might find a violation.

14

plant with the intent specified in 2541(3),

15

entire crop might be subject to sale without violation.

16

Isn't that so?

But in theory,

that's not

correct.

19

QUESTION:

Why not?

20

MR. STANLEY:

Because the most that a farmer is

21

going to use on his own farm is that that he would need to

22

replant his farm.

act - -

crop and decided at the end of the season that he's

2

decided to get out of fanning, so he doesn't -- and if the

3

market, let's say, for seed, is higher than the market for

4

meal, he might say, I'm going to get out of the business

5

completely, I'm just going to sell all my seed to my

6

neighbors.

7

that's my intent now.

8

that a violation?

9

That wasn't my intent when I started out, but

MR. STANLEY:

They can raise the stuff.

Where is

That is a violation because he is

10

selling more than is allowed under the statute. If I can

11

turn to the language of the statute, the key phrase in

12

this is the phrase,

13

saved seed" appears at two places in the statute, one at

14

line 7, before the proviso, and one at line 13, after the

15

proviso, and two points about "such saved seed" are

16

important:

17

of seed.

18

saved seed or any seed that's produced and saved.

1)

"such saved seed."

The term "such

It's a particular and definable quantity

It is not any seed that is saved.

19

It's not any

The second thing is, it means the same thing

20

both before the proviso and after the proviso, such that

21

that term,

22

places in the statute.

23

"such saved seed" has the same meaning at both

The definition of what "such saved seed" means

24

stems right from the opening clause of the statute.

25

Reading right at the beginning, it says, "Except to the
11

*

1

extent that such action may constitute an infringement

2

under subsections (3) and (4) of section 2541."
Now, that opening clause does not mean the

3
4

farmer is free to do whatever he wants except for

5

violating (3) and (4).

6

can do that such action that is later described in that

7

first sentence, provided that action does not violate (3)

8

or (4).

9

the saving of seed produced by him, and using such saved

10
11

What it means is that the farmer

That action that's described in that sentence is

seed in the production of a crop.
Now, if you read subsection (3), it's an act of

12

infringement to sexually multiply the novel variety as a

13

step in marketing the variety for growing purposes, so if

14

you look at how that's incorporated into the beginning of

15

section 2543, that means, except to the extent that such

16

action may constitute sexually multiplying the novel

17

variety as a step in marketing.

18

right for a person to save seed produced by him and use

19

such saved seed in the production of a crop for use on his

20

farm or for sale as provided.

21

QUESTION:

It shall not infringe any

No, but you've left of the -- if

22

saved seed in the production of a crop for use on his

23

farm, you left out the words, "or for sale as provided in

24

this section."

25

Right.

MR. STANLEY:

Right.

The such saved seed can be

5
6

However,

And the question, then, is what is

provided in this section?
MR. STANLEY:

7

X

That's critical also, isn't it?

Well, and also what is the amount

8

of such saved seed.

That is a defined quantity, and the

9

first part before you get to the proviso is what defines

10

the amount of such saved seed, and what defines it is the

11

opening clause.

12

and use it to produce a crop, but only to the extent that

13

it was not sexually multiplied as a step in marketing.

14

That --

You can save seed produced on the farm

QUESTION:

15

But why do you say it's only in the

16

production of a crop, because in the very next phrase, "or

17

for sale as provided in this section."

18

either purpose describes a kind of such saved seed.

19

MR. STANLEY:

It seems to me

Right, but if such saved seed is a

20

definite amount, you could either use it in the production

21

of a crop, or sell it.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

But where do you get the definite

amount?

1

Because you're reading the phrase to

such saved seed in the --

reading.

6

MR. STANLEY:

7

QUESTION:

8

(a) in the production of a crop
That's your

Right.

So that the for sale necessarily

relates back to the saved seed, and if that implies
quantity, then the amount that can be sold is subject to

10

that quantity.

MR. STANLEY:

11
12

That's your argument.
Yes.

The such saved -- the word

"such" is what defines the quantity.

QUESTION:

Well, I mean --

14

MR. STANLEY:

QUESTION:

The quantity is -- if I --

I think you place a lot of stress on

16

the "except" clause, "except to the extent that such

17

action may constitute an infringement under subsection

18

(3) ."

1

If I understand your argument, it is that

20

provision which prevents a farmer from saving seed for

21

reproductive -- for crop production purposes, other than

22

his own crop.

Isn't that right?

from saving an infinite quantity for future seeding

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. STANLEY:

3

For use as seed for reproductive

purposes.
QUESTION:

4

And getting back to Justice Scalia's

5

question, or at least the section that he was focusing on,

6

I don't understand why his cultivation of that crop was

7

not a violation of the act under your theory, because this

8

was sexually multiplying a novel variety as a step in

9

marketing, but you told Justice O'Connor that you have to

10

wait till the sale before there's a violation, and I don't

11

understand that.

12

1

And it was sold to others as seed.

MR. STANLEY:

No, no.

At the time where -- one

13

of the questions pointed out that he may wait until the

14

following season to decide what he wants to do with it.

15

In that situation, you might have to wait till he decides

16

to market it.

17

At the point where it's clear that he has a

18

contract to sell all his production for seed, or

19

something, at that point there is no amount of seed that

20

can be saved.

21

this case comes out of the fact that such saved seed is

22

that which was sexually multiplied but not as a step in

23

MR. STANLEY:

Yes.

If they

Now, they only need 800 bushels to

plant those 800 acres on their farm, so the most seed they
can save to use on their farm is 800 bushels.

the language of the statute that question doesn't solve
the problem.
QUESTION:

You really haven't answered my

do we do with this case, and how does it affect the

MR. STANLEY:

I think that the answer to that, I

think that at a minimum the case should be remanded at the
Federal Circuit to determine that issue, and basically let
them resort out the issue under a proper interpretation of
"marketing."
I believe that when "marketing" is given its
proper interpretation, that our position that you can sell
no more than needed to replant a farm is appropriate.

encompass authority to do the further act.
As an example, under subsection (2) of section

If you sell abroad, it's exportation.
MR. SEAMON:

There is a lot of force to

8

petitioner's argument that sale is one thing and providing

9

notice is another.

The reason that we ultimately, on

10

balance, side with respondents on that point is just that

11

subsection (6) doesn't just talk about giving notice, it

12

talks about dispensing a novel variety.

notice to the purchasing farmer that the seed is a

But it's important to this connection to note

18

that in the proviso itself, Congress required selling

19

farmers to comply with State laws governing the sale of

20

crops, and many of those State laws go to labeling and

21

providing certain information to the farmer in connection

22

with the sale.

We think that because Congress actually gave

attention in the proviso itself to the information that

purchasing farmers should have regarding the variety, if

information that this seed is a protected variety, it

would have spoken to that in the proviso itself.

This applies to all State laws, not

QUESTION:

Well, that may be, and it may not be

7
8

MR. BODE:

They contemplated selling their seed

either for reproductive or nonreproductive purposes.

9

QUESTION:

Right.

10

MR. BODE:

The point is this, and it's a point

11

that was broached by Justice O'Connor, in the Monsanto

12

brief below, which invented this interpretation which is

13

now adopted by Asgrow and presented before this Court,

14

there are two premises that are necessary as a matter of

15

textual analysis.

16

The first is that "marketing" has to equal

17

"selling," and the second is that "crop" has to be limited

18

to the amount of seed to plant an ensuing crop.

19

By way of an example, if a farmer plants 1 acre

20

and harvests 45 bushels of soybeans, then under the

21

recently found interpretation of this text by Asgrow, it

22

can save only 1 bushel, but what happens to the other

purposes.
MR. BODE:

2

Their analysis requires that the term

3

"saving" be limited to 1 bushel.

In fact, Your Honor,

4

Monsanto in its brief makes this statement:

5

seed does equal harvested seed, then the right to save

6

seed would be unlimited in scope, as long as a farmer were

selling to another farmer."

You can sell seed to make oil out of,

Absolutely.

QUESTION:

But that's not reproductive.

15

MR. BODE:

Absolutely, and let's assume that in

our example 45 bushels of soybean are harvested.

17

18

and the statute tells us that.

It has been now by Congress,

the act.

Well, on your view, then, if a farmer

7

made 51 percent of his income from growing melons, and he

8

devoted the remainder of his farm to growing soybeans, he

9

could be in the brown bag business with 100 percent of his

10

soybean crop because he would still be predominantly in

11

the business of -- or the predominant source of his income

12

would be that of farming rather than selling.

13

MR. BODE:

Yes.

We believe that the Federal

14

Circuit correctly parts -- parses the statute, and it

15

correctly interpreted the primary farming occupation be

16

satisfied when a farmer sells the majority of his or her

17

crop for nonreproductive purposes.

18

QUESTION:

I'm puzzled.

I thought that you lost

19

at least in part in the Federal Circuit because your view

20

of this was, as long as it's a farmer selling to another

21

farmer, you're home free, as long as most of what both

22

buyer and seller do, grow crops to sell the product, but

23

the Federal Circuit cut you back and said - - what percent

did they allow?

50 percent or more.

MR. BODE:

First of all, we had agreed for

purposes of the appeal that the primary farming occupation

As we note in footnote 3, the Winterboers sold

10

more than 50 percent of each of the protected varieties

have satisfied the primary farmer occupation test as laid

down by the federal Circuit.

Justice Scalia,

regardless of whether the analysis is crop-by-crop, that

interpretation of Asgrow, because you never have occasion

Where is the term primary farming

occupation found in the statute?
MR. BODE:

to do that, unless "saved seed" means 1 bushel in our

uphold the Federal Circuit, because whatever bundle of

21

rights comprise "marketing," farmers are excepted from

22

them by the first phrase of the proviso in the section.

That is, that without regard to those infringing acts --

QUESTION:

-- that's assuming that the

2

definition of "such saved seed" totally ignores 2541(3),

3

right, which I'm not sure it does.

4

MR. BODE:

It does not, and that's why the

5

interpretation of the Federal Circuit was reasonable.

6

Coordinating activities by agribusinesses and wholesalers

7

is prescribed, but not the limited marketing activities of

8

farmers incidental to farmer-to-farmer sales.

9

For example, a farmer could put out a seed-for-

10

sale sign on his property and entertain telephone

11

inquiries about the nature of the seed he has for sale.

12

That might be a marketing activity, but it wouldn't be the

13

concerted and extended activities, the use of middle men,

14

that's prescribed under the Federal Circuit's opinion, and

15

under the Fifth Circuit's opinion in Delta Pine.

16

Therefore, that's a way of rationalizing every

17

phrase in the second, making every phrase operative, and

18

it comports fully with the Federal Circuit's

19

interpretation, extended, coordinated selling activities

20

involving the multiplication of seed for growing purposes

21

is prohibited, and a farmer cannot enter contracts with

22

farm cooperatives and cotton gins and wholesalers to

23

multiply seed for that purpose, but a farmer can engage in

24

these incidental activities, incidental selling activities

25

associated with selling seed to another farmer directly.

2

Mr. Bode, you made an argument a

little earlier, I've been trying to figure it out, based

3

on the sentence -- I guess you say it's the second

4

sentence, a bona fide sale for other than reproductive

5

purposes made -- I think you said that under petitioner's

6

interpretation that becomes redundant, was that your

7

point, but why --

MR. BODE:

That's our point.

What happens --

QUESTION:

Why isn't it redundant under yours as

12

it to be used for reproductive purposes, you're not going

13

to be held liable, but that would apply to a sale of more

than 50 percent by, you know, your interpretation as well,

now focusing on, they do not use the phrase,

That is correct.

MR. BODE:

But as provided by the phrase, "or

QUESTION:

Well, it encompasses, but is not

you were trying to make, and I think the argument fails

because of the absence of that phrase in the second

MR. BODE:

We disagree, again, because the

MR. BODE:

interpretation, because there's no notice required.

Why?

Because the first sentence exempts that infringing act
with respect to seed sold for reproductive purposes, seed
sold in the second sentence.

If that weren't so, then you

would -- you would have no purpose for that last sentence.
It would -- it would be meaningless.
QUESTION:
I'll study that.

Well, I'm not sure that that's so.

But the third sentence could also apply

to the first sentence, could it not?
MR. BODE:

That's my point.

The first sentence

and the second sentence and the third sentence are all
one, unified section.

There's no independent, separate

crop exemption, as Asgrow suggests at page 5 of its brief,
and therefore it's inapplicable to this case.
