CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

5

Ms. Friedman, you may proceed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RUTH FRIEDMAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. FRIEDMAN:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and

may it please the Court:
Alabama's capital sentencing scheme provides for

10
11

two decision-makers to determine sentence, a jury and a

12

judge.

13

always said that the jury has a sentencing role to play.

14

The Alabama code addresses both jury and judge with

15

provisions on how to determine sentence.

The legislature and the courts of Alabama have

16

The legislature intended that "juries play a

17

major role in capital cases in Alabama" as the Alabama

18

supreme court noted in its landmark decision in Beck v.

19

State.

20

role cannot count for nothing in Alabama's system, where

21

the judge is the ultimate sentencing authority, following

22

the jury's completion of its significant part.

23

The court confirmed in Ex Parte Williams that that

In Johnson v. State, the Court of Criminal

24

Appeals said that an Alabama capital jury must be death

25

qualified precisely because it plays a "key role in the

1

sentencing process," and despite the State's suggestion to

2

the contrary in its brief, a trial court's rejection of a

3

jury's advisory verdict is always understood and referred

4

to in the case law as an override of that verdict.
QUESTION:

5

Well, that certainly isn't

6

technically correct, is it?

7

claimed the jury has final authority in the event the

8

judge didn't act.

9

MS. FRIEDMAN:

10

have final authority --

11

QUESTION:

12

MS. FRIEDMAN:

I mean, because no one

That's correct, the jury does not

So it's not like Florida.
It is like Florida.

The Alabama

13

supreme court has said consistently, actually, that

14

Alabama is virtually identical to Florida in that it is a

15

dual sentencing State.

16

not have final sentencing authority, but it is a

17

constituent sentencer, as this Court has recognized in

18

Espinosa that in Florida the jury is a constituent

19

sentencer and Alabama has said that our system is

20

virtually identical to that.

It does not have -- the jury does

And the Alabama courts have said repeatedly that

21

22

the jury verdict and the capital sentencing jury has

23

very significant role to play, and that can be discerned

24

from both the statutory provisions and the case law in

25

Alabama.

a

The statutory provisions are addressed in 13A-

1

2

5-46, for example, to the capital sentencing jury, on how

3

it is to determine sentence, and that includes the

4

weighing and consideration of aggravation in mitigation,

5

the returning of a verdict only under certain

6

circumstances -- that is, when seven, at least 7 jurors

7

vote that death is -- life is the appropriate punishment,

8

or 10 that death is the appropriate punishment, and if

9

those numbers aren't reached, a new panel must be

10

empaneled because that verdict would not have been reached

11

by the first sentencer.
The State's attempt in this case to transform

12

13

the life without parole recommendation of this constituent

14

sentencer into a fact in mitigation is inconsistent, thus,

15

with the history and the logic of Alabama's capital

16

sentencing scheme.

17

QUESTION:

On the facts of this case, can you

18

tell me, for the four defendants were there four different

19

juries?

20

MS. FRIEDMAN:

That's correct.

Well, actually,

21

one of the defendants, the codefendant in this case,

22

pleaded guilty in exchange for his testimony.

23

QUESTION:

All right.

In the jury -- was it

That's correct.

What was the division there, was it 7

That jury

Yes, it was.

But a different jury than Harris'

jury?
MS. FRIEDMAN:

10

QUESTION:

11

MS. FRIEDMAN:

That's correct.

Thank you.
That's correct, and it's

12

impossible to tell, based on what this judge did, why this

13

jury was rejected, the jury's verdict was rejected in

14

Mrs. Harris' case.

IS

Mrs. Harris' case of why the jury's life without parole

verdict was not --

No explanation was given in

I take it that's consistent with

Alabama law.

explanation from the judge as to why he rejected the

20

jury's verdict.

21

The Alabama courts have never required an

MS. FRIEDMAN:

And that's -- that's exactly

22

right, and that's why Mrs. Harris is here today, because

23

what Alabama law has done is, in essence, created a dual

24

sentencing system, but done nothing to regulate the

25

relationship between the sentencers.

QUESTION:

1

Well, you call it a dual sentencing

2

system, but the statute says, while the jury's

3

recommendation concerning sentence shall be given

4

consideration, it is not binding upon the court.

5

the trial judge recited that he had considered the jury's

6

recommendation.

7

more.

9

The statute does not require any

more, Chief Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

10
11

Surely the statute doesn't require any

MS. FRIEDMAN:

8

Here,

What's your authority for thinking

the Constitution requires any more?
MS. FRIEDMAN:

12

Because this Court's

13

jurisprudence under the Eighth Amendment has always said

14

that procedures by which a death penalty is imposed must

IS

be reliable.

16

In Godfrey v. Georgia, for example, this Court

17

said that a State must tailor and apply its law in a

18

manner that avoids arbitrariness.

19

QUESTION:

If a jury were out of this picture

20

entirely and you just had a judge with the standards that

21

the judge has given, there would be no constitutional

22

infirmity.

23

MS. FRIEDMAN:

That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.

24

In Alabama, it is pretty consistent with Federal law to

25

withdraw the jury from this process.

It's also pretty

1

consistent with Federal law to withdraw the judge from

2

this process.

3

both of whom are governed by the Eighth Amendment, and

4

have no connection whatsoever between them.

What it cannot do is have two sentencers,

5

QUESTION:

Well, isn't --

6

QUESTION:

What is the constitutional

7

requirement?

8

that Florida uses that's been called the Tedder standard,

9

that that's not constitutionally required, but I don't

10
11

You have said that the particular standard

think you identified what is the constitutional minimum.
MS. FRIEDMAN:

That's right.

The Tedder

12

standard is not itself constitutionally required, but this

13

Court has recognized it is constitutionally acceptable.

14
15

There are a number of valid standards that
Alabama could apply.

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. FRIEDMAN:

What's the least?
The least standard might be that

18

the jury's verdict is rejected if there's some reasonable

19

basis for rejecting that, or if no reasonable person could

20

differ that life was not the appropriate punishment, or

21

another minimal basis could be that the jury's verdict was

22

itself considered a mitigating factor, as some of the

23

courts have done in Alabama, because they literally do not

24

know how to factor this jury verdict into the sentencing

25

consideration.

QUESTION:

1

Why -- what about just disagreeing

2

with the jury?

I mean, I could understand the need for a

3

reasoned rejection of the jury verdict if the jury verdict

4

itself were a reasoned verdict.

5

give reasons why it thought that the death sentence should

6

not be imposed?
MS. FRIEDMAN:

7

Was it?

Did the jury

The jury is not required under

8

Alabama law to specify aggravation in mitigation, though

9

there is no reason in this case -QUESTION:

10

So it just comes in and says, we

11

recommend life?

What could the judge possibly say to

12

explain his disagreement except to say, I disagree?

13

knowing the reasons the jury said that, how can you

14

explain the reason for your rejecting?

15

see it differently.
MS. FRIEDMAN:

16

His reason is,

be, I weigh the aggravation differently against the

18

mitigation to come up with a different -- a different

19

response.

21
22

I

Justice Scalia, I disagree would

17

20

Not

Alabama law requires something else.
QUESTION:

Doesn't he say that implicitly simply

by saying, in my view the death penalty is the right one?
MS. FRIEDMAN:

But Alabama law requires the

23

judge to do something else.

24

aggravation outweighs mitigation, because the statute

25

requires something else.

It's not just enough to say,

The statute requires that

somehow that jury verdict be factored into the calculus,

be factored into the process.

QUESTION:

4

No, it doesn't require -- it requires

that he consider it.

5

MS. FRIEDMAN:

6

QUESTION:

7

MS. FRIEDMAN:

8

QUESTION:

Did he consider it?

He -- this trial judge did say

And he disagreed with it, evidently.

MS. FRIEDMAN:

10

He clearly must have disagreed

with it.
QUESTION:

12

13

And he did.

that he considered the verdict.

9

11

And our contention is --

What more could be possibly have

said --

14

MS. FRIEDMAN:

15

QUESTION:

Because --

-- to show why he disagreed with it,

16

since he didn't know the basis on which it was -- itself

17

was made?

18

MS. FRIEDMAN:

He said nothing about what may

19

have been improper about this verdict, and when there are

20

two sentencers, which Alabama has created, I consider it

21

simply not constitutionally sufficient.

22

If this Court -- if a trial judge had said with

23

regard to aggravation and mitigation, I did what I was

24

supposed to do, but didn't say what that was, that

25

wouldn't be sufficient, and this Court has recognized in

1

other contexts that simply saying, I did something, such

2

as, I found this case to be heinous, atrocious, and cruel,

3

is not enough when that doesn't provide sufficient

4

guidance to the sentencer to make a sentencing decision,

5

and that's what we have here.

6

QUESTION:

Ms. Friedman --

7

QUESTION:

But the role that the jury has here

8

seems to be a familiar one, and this is not unknown.

9

is like the advisory jury in equity.

It

If you look at

10

Federal Rule 39(c), you'll see an advisory jury, that it's

11

not binding on the judge, that he will consider or she

12

will consider for the value he or she thinks it has, so

13

why isn't -- and that's certainly compatible with the

14

Constitution.

15

Why should this be regarded differently?

MS. FRIEDMAN:

Because the Eighth Amendment

16

requires some guided discretion of the sentencer, and here

17

we have -- a second sentencer has to evaluate the judgment

18

of the first sentencer and has absolutely no idea how to

19

take that into consideration, which allows for

20

arbitrariness, and that's evidenced by --

21
22

23

QUESTION:

No more arbitrary than if the judge

were alone during the sentence.
MS. FRIEDMAN:

And if the judge were alone

24

during the sentence, Justice Ginsburg, we wouldn't have an

25

issue here.

There would not be a problem of a

1

disconnection when there is a disagreement between the

2

sentencers, and Alabama is free to set up that system if

3

it wishes.
This Court said in Johnson v. Mississippi that

4
5

there is no perfect procedure by which a State can set up

6

its capital sentencing scheme, but it cannot set up a

7

scheme that's premised in any way on caprice, and that's

8

what we have here, because two sentencers are required.
The jury verdict -- the jury in this case is

9
10

very much like a penalty phase jury in other States where

11

there is no additional sentencer, where the judge is not

12

involved.

13

instructed, it has to hear only admissible evidence and

14

then return a verdict only under certain circumstances,

15

and as I said, the cede provision is addressed to the

16

jury.

QUESTION:

Is your client somehow worse off

because a jury made a recommendation of life?
MS. FRIEDMAN:

She's worse off under the scheme

that -- yes, that Alabama has created.
QUESTION:

I.e., worse off than if there had

been no jury at all?
MS. FRIEDMAN:

But we cannot look, Justice

Kennedy, at the scheme as if there is no jury.
QUESTION:

Well, if we look at just that,

1

because Justice Ginsburg was asking you what if there were

2

just a judge sitting, and so my question is, is your

3

client really worse off than if there were no jury at all?

4

Here's a jury who tells a judge, 7 to 5, we think it

5

should be life.

6

no jury at all?

7
8

How is she worse off than if there'd been

MS. FRIEDMAN:

I think she would not be worse

off if we just had a jury involved in sentencing in
Alabama or if we just had --

10

QUESTION:

11

MS. FRIEDMAN:

12

QUESTION:

13

No, that's not my question.
I'm sorry.

My question is, why is she worse off

under the present system?

14

MS. FRIEDMAN:

Because she was sentenced to

15

death under a process that was unreliable.

16

requires that that jury be involved in the sentencing

17

process.

18
1

QUESTION:

Alabama law

Why is it less reliable if a judge

has an opinion to take into account?
MS. FRIEDMAN:

20

Because -- precisely because the

21

advisory verdict of an Alabama jury is not simply an

22

opinion.

23

opinion, but it has treated it as --

25

An Alabama law has never treated it as simply an

QUESTION:
complaining about.

I assume that that's what you're
Let's say it was just an opinion.

Is

1

your client any worse off?
MS. FRIEDMAN:

2

3

If it was just a --

4

QUESTION:

If it was just an opinion, no.

Well then, how is she any worse off

5

under this procedure, where it's even more than an

6

opinion?

7

for her.
MS. FRIEDMAN:

8

9

It seems to me that that's even more protection

Because it's more of an opinion,

Justice Kennedy -- because it's more than an opinion.

It

10

is the advisory verdict of a sentencer, and you asked in

11

this case, is she worse off?
We have no idea why the judge rejected the

12

13

advisory verdict of life without parole in this case, on

14

which there was considerable basis for returning that

15

verdict.

16

This jury heard evidence that Mrs. Harris was a

17

mother of seven, that she worked three jobs while she was

18

raising her family, that she had no prior criminal history

19

whatsoever, and that this -- the killing in this case

20

occurred after a history of domestic strife between

21

husband and wife, including incidents in which her husband

22

had hit Mrs. Harris in the head, threatened her with a

23

gun, and where there had been a separation and an

24

application for divorce.

25

Under those circumstances, the jury was required

1

under Alabama law to return a considered verdict, an

2

advisory verdict of what the appropriate punishment was,

3

and Alabama law requires, the statute requires that the

4

judge do more here than simply consider aggravation and

5

mitigation, and this Court has recognized in cases such as

6

Espinosa v. Florida, or Gardner v. Florida, that when the

7

Alabama -- excuse me, when a trial judge must do more than

8

simply consider aggravation and mitigation, there is

9

another issue that this Court must take into account which

10

can lead to an arbitrary sentence of death, which is what

11

happened in this case, which is why she is worse off.

12

When one looks at the sentencing orders returned

13

in the cases in Alabama, it is impossible to have any kind

14

of consistent formulation as to how the jury was made part

15

of the process.

16

QUESTION:

Well, is that a different argument?

17

I mean, you've been arguing about the unreliability of

18

what happened in this case and can happen in other cases,

19

but are you also making the argument that in fact

20

different trial judges are applying different standards in

21

evaluating what the jury's verdict actually is?

22

merely that some happen to give great weight in a given

23

case and others happen to give little weight, but that

24

there are different legal standards that they are bringing

25

to bear in deciding what to do with a jury verdict?

Not

Is

1

that also your argument?

2

MS. FRIEDMAN:

3

QUESTION:

Certainly, Justice Souter.

Well, I went back, and here's where I

4

want you to help me out.

I went back through, admittedly

5

somewhat quickly this morning, but I went back through the

6

examples that you gave in your brief, and I found examples

7

in which some trial judges are saying that they consider

8

the jury's recommendation as a mitigating circumstance.
I found some in which they simply don't say

9
10

that -- they don't say that they don't consider it a

11

mitigating circumstance.

12

and I found a third category in which judges, whether they

13

call it a mitigating circumstance or not, in fact have

14

said that they gave great weight to the jury verdict.

15

They just don't describe it --

Do those three examples ground an inference that

16

there are different legal standards being used in the

17

importance given to the verdict as distinct from simply

18

different treatments, depending on what in individual

19

cases judges happen to think the value of the jury

20

recommendation is?
Is there a -- as they say today, is there a

21
22

systemic difference based on legal standards, or are there

23

just varieties of applications which vary according to the

24

evidence?

25

MS. FRIEDMAN:

I think there are differing legal

1

standards.

I think there are some judges who say -QUESTION:

2

Well, can you infer that from the

3

examples that I gave, or am I missing something?

Is there

4

something more in here?

5

MS. FRIEDMAN:

6

which are also useful to look at.

7

some judges who say, I reject the jury's life-without-

8

parole verdict, because there's a reasonable basis for

9

doing that, and there are other judges who say, I reject

I think there are other cases
For example, there are

10

the jury's verdict even though there is a reasonable basis

11

for the jury's verdict.
They're approaching it in a completely different

12

13

way, and they also take it into account in a different

14

2

certain level.

3

mentioned before, that the statute itself says this

4

advisory verdict is an advisory verdict, it is a

We are not saying that Alabama need make that

advisory verdict binding on the trial court, but what it

need do is regulate the relationship between the

14

When there is a disagreement between the

factor it in, and the problem that arises, as can be seen

in the different orders of the trial courts, is that

QUESTION:

9

If we assume that that's true, then

reweighing by the Alabama appellate court is insufficient?
MS. FRIEDMAN:

6

7

That is an inconsistent and arbitrary

It is insufficient, and for two

reasons.
First of all, what the Alabama supreme court
does in its discussion of reweighing is never addressed,

10

what the jury's role was in the process, and that's

11

certainly what happened in Mrs. Harris' case, and

12

secondly, Alabama does not reweigh aggravation and

13

mitigation in the way that this Court has understood that

14

term in cases such as Clemons.

15

It has said specifically in Longhorn v. State

16

that it does not reweigh, and if there are errors below,

17

that sentence is sent back to the trial court for the

18

trial court to impose sentence.

QUESTION:

I was referring to the intermediate

appellate court.
MS. FRIEDMAN:

And that's true for the

intermediate appellate court as well, Justice Kennedy.
The language of the statute is, we do an

24

independent reweighing, and that language certainly goes

25

to the appellate court's review, which also involves

1

proportionality.

2

But what it does not do is address part of the

3

process that happened below, which is, because the judge

4

was required to do more than consider aggravation and

5

mitigation, but also to make that jury verdict a part of

6

the process, which is mandated by statute, the appellate

7

review is insufficient because it does not review what

8

actually happened below.

9

And as to reweighing, the Alabama appellate

10

courts do not do that in the traditional way that this

11

court understands reweighing to take place.

12

And as I mentioned before, in cases such as

13

Espinosa, or in cases such as Gardner v. Florida, the fact

14

that aggravation is found to outweigh mitigation does not

15

address an arbitrary element in the process, and that's

16

what we have here, with the disconnection between the two

17

sentencers.

18

This Court has said, in cases going as far back

19

as Gregg, that the Eighth Amendment limits the discretion

20

of the sentencers to minimize the risk of arbitrary

21

action, and what we have in this case is arbitrary action.

22

Because Alabama has required that two sentencers be

23

involved in this process, it creates, without some

24

connection between them, the risk of arbitrariness because

QUESTION:

1

What is your response to the State's

2

argument that the history in Alabama shows that juries

3

were predisposed to acquit white defendants of murdering

4

black victims, or committing crimes against them, the

5

jury's prejudice would tilt the scales in favor of the

6

white defendant, and that they needed the judge override

7

to override life -- arbitrary recommendations of life in

8

that category of cases?

9

MS. FRIEDMAN:

They argue that in their brief.
Certainly the judge can form

10

that -- can provide that role if the Alabama supreme court

11

were to announce such a standard as racial prejudice, if

12

there was some evidence or suggestion of racial prejudice,

13

or some other kind of improper action on the part of the

14

jury, but that has not happened.

15

The Alabama supreme court has announced no such

16

standard, and there is certainly no evidence or suggestion

17

in this case that there's any such impropriety in the

18

forming of the jury verdict here.

19

It is very critical for this Court to understand

20

that Alabama has created a dual sentencing scheme, and the

21

role of that jury, while it is not binding, while it is

advisory, is just like the penalty phase juries in other

So on your -- going back to your

answer to Justice Ginsburg, in which you thought one

standard might be that the judge could not override unless

no reasonable jury could have come to the conclusion that

the trial jury did, you would make it more difficult for

the justifications for this scheme is that there tends to

your theory that it would be more difficult on your -- on

No, it would not, because the

1

Isn't there a distinction between the

discretion to give weight according to what the evidence

warrants in a given case on the one hand, and discretion

4

to consider an aspect of the process as either of no value

5

or of great value?
And I thought the implication of the way Justice

6

7

Kennedy phrased his question was that the -- there was a

8

difference not specific to cases, but a difference which

9

amounted to a different legal standard in the manner in

10

which the judges from county to county were evaluating the

11

fact, we'll call it, of the jury recommendation.
The first kind of discretion to take evidence

12

13

for what it's worth is undoubted.

discretion is different.

arbitrary variation in sentencing?

Okay.

In County 1, the judge says, I always

could have come to that conclusion.

In County 2, the

10

judge says, I never accept a jury's recommendation as

carrying any more weight than in fact I think it's worth,

based on the individual circumstances of the case.

Assuming you have that kind of a variation,

Is there an Eighth Amendment problem or an equal

Perhaps it would be an equal

are being treated differently.

QUESTION:

Why shouldn't we consider the same

11

disparity under our nonarbitrariness jurisprudence under

MR. BJURBERG:

QUESTION:

Yes, it would be.

There's one aspect of this case I

wish you would address.
You have taken the position very clearly that

4
5

the jury is advisory only, the judge gives it whatever

6

credit she thinks it deserves, and yet this very

7

sentencing judge that has full responsibility for the

8

sentence says, as far as guilt or innocence, that the jury

9

came in with a guilty verdict, the court has no reason to

10

go behind the guilty verdict of the jury and will not do

11

so.
So the judge is taking no responsibility at all

12

13

for the basic conviction, and yet says, as far as the jury

14

is concerned on sentencing, there I'm not going to give it

15

any credit because I find that the aggravating

16

circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances.

17

I can understand the system that says, the judge

18

has to say yes, I agree with the basic conviction and then

19

go on, but here, the judge is saying, I'm going to leave

20

it to the jury on the basic guilt or innocence.
MR. BJURBERG:

21

Well, I think on the basic guilt

22

or innocence, I think a reasonable interpretation of that

is,

motion for a new trial.

I have no question about that, that

he has to leave the jury verdict of guilty alone.

My

10

question is, can he sentence a person to death unless he

11

is also prepared to say, I would have reached the same

12

result that the jury did on guilt?

13

MR. BJURBERG:

QUESTION:

acceptable for a judge to say, without committing myself

on the question of guilt or innocence -- in other words,

to say, I might have found this person innocent, yet I'm

19

going to give him the death sentence?

20

MR. BJURBERG:

Is it rational?

Is it

Yes, I think it is consistent,

21

because when you go to the sentencing hearing, additional

22

information concerning the defendant, his character and --

23

or her character in this case -- and involvement in the

24

crime, in otherwise those mitigating and aggravating

25

circumstances come before the sentencer, the judge, and

and that's what this judge did in this case.
Let me just quote on page 6 of the joint

5

Well, even without those, I don't

suppose it's irrational to say, you know, I'm not sure who

did this, but whoever did it deserves the death penalty.

8

This was a horrible, heinous crime.
I could conceive that, and if the judge says

9
10

it's really not my -- not my role in this State system to

11

decide who did it, but I do know that whoever did it

12

deserves the death penalty, the jury having found that

this person did it, this person deserves the death

penalty.

There's nothing irrational about that, is there?

No, there isn't, and in fact I

think that's what -- the judge said in this particular

thought that their point is that the Alabama courts have

What this is, just keep in mind that other human

beings hearing this evidence have decided differently and

give that whatever weight in your mind you feel ought to

12

be given to the fact that 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

11, or 12 have decided differently from you.

14

Now, those really are different things.

Judges

in the first case do know how to weigh, and judges in the

16

second case, all the time, know how to take into account

17

the fact that other human beings might decide this matter

differently.

19

But the Alabama supreme court, they say, has not

20

told the judges whether to do the one, or the other, or a

third, and what they think is appropriate as guidance.

22

23

MR. BJURBERG:

to, does the Eighth Amendment require that guidance --

Aren't those different, or are they?

MR. BJURBERG:

I don't -- I don't think they're

5

different, in that -- now, because the sentencer is

6

allowed this broad, Eighth Amendment discretion to

7

consider that advisory verdict as a mitigating

8

circumstance, and another sentencer might consider that

9

advisory verdict as not arising to that particular level,

10

in other words, but that's inherent in discretion.

long as there is discretion in the sentencer, you're going

to get different treatments of essentially the same thing.

The discretion to determine the sort of value in

the abstract of what the jury's recommendations were is

sort of inherent in the indiscretion to consider evidence,

but the discretion to override or not depends upon a legal

standard, and in my hypo, there were two different legal

8

standards, and I take it, as you conceded earlier, that

9

would rise, if there were such a disparity -- one county

has a judge taking the one position, one county has a

not give great weight, because in other sentencing

recommendations that this particular judge has written, he

has said, I give the jury's recommendation great weight,

concede that there would be an Eighth Amendment violation,

under our earlier hypothesis.

7

MR. BJURBERG:

Because as I understood it we

were hypothesizing different legal standards to be applied

by the sentencer when considering it.

Well, if the law in effect says a

judge

equal protection -- or an Eighth Amendment violation in

one case and not the other?

Why is there

Well, because if you have --

standards, which we don't have in Alabama, then there's

19

this perhaps arbitrariness coming in.

20

the discretion is in the sentencer.

the perception of different legal standards is enough to

No, I don't, absolutely not.

Could you tell me -- I just don't --

I should know this, and I don't.

which would state or articulate the weight that was going

to be given by him to the jury verdict?

MR. BJURBERG:

5

QUESTION:

Not to my remembrance.

If thee were an Eighth Amendment

6

violation of the sort that we've been discussing, would it

7

be cured by the independent reweighing that the appellate

8

court did at page 101 of the transcript?
MR. BJURBERG:

I believe so, and let me clarify

10

that.

The appellate -- the intermediate appellate court

11

doesn't reweigh, it independently weighs the aggravating

12

and mitigating circumstances on appeal.
QUESTION:

13

Yes.

It says at page 101 that after

14

an independent weighing, we find that it's the proper

sentence.

MR. BJURBERG:

No presumption, no, sir.

It does, yes.

As if it were the jury?

In other

words, it doesn't give the jury recommendation any weight

It doesn't.

It just starts

MR. BJURBERG:

No, I think it --

That can't be right, because it

considers the presentence report, doesn't it?
MR. BJURBERG:

Yes.

Right, it did not.

Does it just merely say in our

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RUTH FRIEDMAN

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. FRIEDMAN:

6

To respond to the earlier

7

questions about appellate review, the Alabama supreme

8

court does not see itself as having the authority to

9

impose a sentence de novo, or to do that kind of

10

reweighing analysis whenever independent of some kind of

11

error below.

12

court always sends the case back, so it is not a de novo

13

sentencing that the Alabama courts have ever seen

14

themselves authorized to perform.

15

If there is an error below, the appellate

weight was given to the jury life-without-parole verdict,

2

the same judge not only gave it different weight, but

3

treated it as a mitigating factor in one case and not a

4

mitigating factor in another.

5

So that question of, from county to county, it's

6

so irregular that even the same judge is treating the

7

verdict in a different way, and I think one thing we can

8

tell, certainly from the practice in history of override

9

in Alabama, is that Alabama defendants certainly are not

10

benefiting from it.

95 percent of those overrides are

11

jury life-without-parole verdicts overridden into death

12

verdicts.

13

What Alabama has is an otherwise constitutional

14

process that is operating in an arbitrary manner, and all

15

the Alabama court needs to do is state a rule and fix that

arbitrary problem.
