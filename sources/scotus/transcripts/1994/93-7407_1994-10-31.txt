ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS R. WETTERER, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. WETTERER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The issue in Robert O'Neal's case is that once a

11
12

habeas corpus petitioner has proven a constitutional

13

violation, does the State then have the burden to prove

14

the constitutional violation harmless beyond a reasonable

15

doubt under Kotteakos?

16

It used to be beyond a reasonable doubt under

17

Chapman.

18

reduced the burden that the State must maintain, and with

19

the reduction of the burden also came the allocation of

20

the burden, so yes, the State must maintain the burden of

21

proving the error harmless.

22

This Court adopted the Kotteakos standard, which

With Kotteakos came the Kotteakos case law.

As

23

in Justice Stevens' case, Justice Stevens' concurrence

24

indicated that placed the burden of proving harmless error

25

on the State for constitutional claims.

This was

1

consistent with all the Court's precedent in this area of

2

harmless error determination.

3

Under Chapman, the burden was placed upon the

4

State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, and now the

5

Court has placed the burden upon the State to prove the

6

error harmless, with no substantial and injurious effect

7

upon the verdict.
QUESTION:

10

direct appeal.

Well, Chapman, Mr. Wetterer, was on

Why shouldn't the result be different on

habeas?
MR. WETTERER:

11

And that was the issue that this

12

Court resolved in the Brecht case, and didn't make a

13

different result by reducing the burden on the State to

14

accommodate the interest of the State in finality, comity,

15

and federalism.

16

QUESTION:

Well, why shouldn't it also

17

accommodate those interests by saying that the burden is

18

on the petitioner rather than on the State as to, when the

19

thing is equally divided, I guess?
MR. WETTERER:

20

Because the writ would no longer

21

be able to serve the purposes that this Court has placed

22

upon it.

23

ensure the accurate determination of guilt and innocence

24

in the trial process, and to protect the constitutional

25

rights, the burden must remain with the State.

In order to protect the factually innocent and

In those cases in which there is an equal

1

2

inference on whether or not the petitioner has met his

3

claim or not, traditionally the State has borne that risk

4

of error and the risk that the constitutional right was

5

not violated.
QUESTION:

6

7

affected by how we decide this question?
MR. WETTERER:

8

9

Do you think a lot of cases will be

Under the current case law it

indicates that not as many as would under other cases that

10

this Court has decided in habeas corpus, because under

11

habeas corpus law, under Fretwell, the Court is supposed

12

to first determine whether a constitutional violation has

13

been made.

14

If this Court were to place the burden upon the

15

petitioner, then this case would affect every case, every

16

habeas corpus case in the United States, because then the

17

Court would then have to determine prejudice as part of

18

the determination on the merits.

19

If this Court remains the burden on the State to

20

prove harmless error once the petitioner has proven a

21

constitutional violation, then this will affect a few

22

cases, because under the Chapman standard it was estimated

23

that only 1 in 1,000 cases warranted any review under the

24

Chapman standard.

25

It's assumed that not that many petitioners will

will find relief under the lower standard of

make the

2

Kotteakos, and therefore it depends upon the decision of

3

this Court whether this impact has a -- has an impact in

4

every Federal case that ever comes before any court or

5

magistrate, or whether this decision only applies in those

6

situations that once the Court has found that there has

7

been a violation of the constitutional rights.

8

If there's been a violation of constitutional
rights proven by the petitioner, that has met the interest

10

that this Court has set for a meeting of comity, finality,

11

and federalism under McCleskey.

12

has no interest in a constitutionally defective judgment.

13

At that point, the State

Under the Kotteakos standard, this Court has

14

said that when there is grave doubt as to the impact of

15

the error, then relief is to be granted, and that is those

16

cases in which the State has been unable to demonstrate

17

that the error did not affect the rights of the case.

18

In a lot of cases, it will be very clear for the

1

Court that the error did or did not affect, but in those

20

few cases, in those cases in which the courts have

21

reviewed the record, found a constitutional violation, and

22

then have been unable to really determine whether there

23

has been a violation but they have grave doubt, and those

24

cases clearly were granted relief under Chapman and should

25

still remain to be granted relief under Kotteakos and

QUESTION:

So if you do not prevail in this

3

case, and a court looks at all the evidence and concludes,

4

we're not sure what would have happened, but this had a

5

significant influence on the jury's determination, it was

a close case, it was --we just don't know, what result

under the standard that you are proposing?

MR. WETTERER:

Under this standard, the

Kotteakos standard, the new trial would be granted,
because every -QUESTION:

All right, and what result under the

standard that the State and the Government are proposing?
MR. WETTERER:

That that petitioner would remain

14

with loss of life or liberty.

15

QUESTION:

In other words, as you interpret the

16

burden of proof that the Government and the State are

17

arguing for, the petitioner has to show what, that there

18

likely would have been a different result?

19

MR. WETTERER:

The petitioner must demonstrate

20

that there has been a constitutional violation, and that

21

is a huge hurdle to overcome in Federal habeas.

22

QUESTION:

We know that.

What about the effect

23

on the verdict?

24

under the State's proposal, as you understand it?

What does the petitioner have to show

petitioner has to prove that it actually had a substantial

2

and injurious effect upon the verdict, and then besides -QUESTION:

3
4

Does that mean it's more likely than

not that the verdict would have been different?
MR. WETTERER:

5

It depends upon whether the -- it

6

would appear that there would be a conflict with

7

Kotteakos, because Kotteakos says if there's grave doubt

8

as to the outcome, then you're supposed to grant relief.

9
10

The State's saying that we have to prove actual
prejudice.
QUESTION:

11

Is there grave doubt, in your view,

12

if the judge looks at the case and he or she says, I just

13

can't tell?

14

MR. WETTERER:

That's grave doubt under the

15

Kotteakos standard.

16

doubts, or I have doubts that this verdict was obtained in

17

a constitutional manner, and then we have found a

18

constitutional violation.

MR. WETTERER:

2

QUESTION:

3

Excuse me, Your Honor.

Even under the Government's standard

the writ is granted if there's grave doubt?
MR. WETTERER:

4

No, Your Honor.

The Government

wants us to prove actual prejudice.

proving that we have a constitutional claim, we have to

QUESTION:

Not

They're relying on the actual

When you use the term, grave doubt,

13

though, you're not talking about the constitutional

14

violation, but grave doubt as to whether there was any

15

prejudice.

16
17
18

MR. WETTERER:

Grave doubt as to prejudice, yes,

Your Honor.
This Court, when it adopted the Kotteakos

19

standard, the grave doubt standard is in that case and in

20

the lower case law, so those case law would provide

21

guidance to the lower courts which they can use in

22

determining the constitutional -- the determination of

23

whether to grant a writ.

courts as to what the Constitution means.

2

meant that the courts must first determine a

3

constitutional error, then determine whether impact.

4

That has always

If there was a merger, as the State is

5

asserting, between the two concepts, then habeas would no

6

longer be able to provide any guidance to the courts,

7

because every time, the court would have to look at

8

prejudice as part of the constitutional claim.

9

It is consistent to find cases in which there is

10

a constitutional violation and a person may be entitled to

11

relief under Chapman but may not be entitled to relief

12

under the Kotteakos-Brecht standard.

13

would then still know that they have a constitutional

violation that they should then review in their making

their decisions.

to maintain that difference.

Mr. Wetterer, I guess habeas corpus

MR. WETTERER:

20

The State courts

This Court has traditionally

relied on it as a quasi-civil action.
QUESTION:

22

I thought we had indicated that it is

23

civil, and certainly the longstanding rule is that the

24

plaintiff in a civil case has the burden of proof of all

25

elements.

MR. WETTERER:

1

Yes, Your Honor.

However, in

2

this habeas corpus action it is considered by most a

3

quasi-criminal and civil proceeding because it protects

4

the life or liberty of an individual.

5

as when someone is suing over whether or not a contract

6

has been breached and the standard is beyond a

7

preponderance of the evidence.

8

QUESTION:

9
10

It's not the same

But presumably the prisoner in a

habeas action still has to prove that the prisoner is
being held in custody in violation of the Constitution.
MR. WETTERER:

11

This Court has set the Kotteakos

12

standard for the determination of whether custody is

13

the -- whether or not a violation has occurred.

14

standard for the court to decide, and the petitioner just

15

demonstrates his claim, and then the court makes a

16

decision on whether -- what the effect of that is.

17

That's a

If there's been a finding that there has been

18

substantial injurious effect, then he is held in violation

19

of his 'custody, but traditionally the Court has never

20

found that custody -- custody has always equaled whether

21

the person has been held and whether the Court can grant

22

relief.

23

that custody means that the petitioner must prove

24

prejudice for noncon -- for constitutional claims in

25

Federal habeas.

It is never held that -- in recent habeas law

1

It's always separated out, the two concepts,

2

because by merging of the two concepts, we don't protect

3

the people that habeas is supposed to protect.

4

QUESTION:

Well, the habeas petitioner has to

5

satisfy the court that there was a constitutional

6

violation, doesn't he?

7

MR. WETTERER:

8

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

So that certainly accords with the

normal civil presumption, that he's the plaintiff, and
10
11

he's got to carry the burden of proof.
MR. WETTERER:

But in a non -- but you're never

12

going to have, in a civil case, Your Honor, a situation

13

where you have a plaintiff proving that the State has

14

violated his constitutional rights.

15

demonstrated that the --

QUESTION:

Mr. O'Neal has

Well, how about a 1 83 action?

All

17

the time you have plaintiffs trying to prove that the

18

State has violated their constitutional rights, and yet

1

the burden of proof remains on them.

20

MR. WETTERER:

In those civil actions, because

21

they're going for monetary damage, they're not deprived of

22

their life or liberty as a result of State action.

Well, that may be true, but in most,

MR. WETTERER:

He's now come into

relief, and under Chapman he would have been granted

11

relief by the district court finding.

12

Now, he's wanting to get his chance at having a

13

constitutionally fair trial, and consistently this Court

14

has said that the habeas is to protect people like

15

Mr. O'Neal, people whose constitutional rights have been

16

violated, and ensure the accuracy and determination of the

17

guilty and innocent in the State proceedings.

18

QUESTION:

Is it your position that the

19

substantive standard that you get out of Kotteakos makes

20

the linkage question a matter of affirmative defense, if

21

we take the civil case model, that your burden is to show

22

the constitutional violation?

23

some kind of presumption operating in your favor?

MR. WETTERER:

Once you show that, there's

No, Your Honor.

you take the civil case model, is that showing an element

9

of your case, or is it more properly regarded as an

Yes, Your Honor, it's more of an

12

affirmative defense on the State to avoid the actions of

14

QUESTION:

Do I understand you, I guess going

15

back to your answer to the question by Justice Kennedy,

16

that you regard the issue in this case as being both about

17

the burden of proof and the quantum of proof, or do you,

18

on the other hand, say the only thing that is before us is

19

the question of who has the burden, and the quantum of

20

what would be necessary to carry that burden is a separate

21

issue for a separate case?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. CORDRAY

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

10

MR. CORDRAY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may

it please the Court:
To reframe, the single issue on which the Court

11

12

granted certiorari in this case is whether the habeas

13

petitioner or the habeas respondent bears the burden of

14

showing that any error identified at trial was of such

15

magnitude that it actually had a substantial and injurious

16

effect in determining the jury's verdict.

17

It is our position that the habeas petitioner

18

properly bears this burden, as stated in Brecht, for two

19

reasons'.

20

habeas proceedings as civil actions.

21

First, this is consistent with the nature of

Second, this is consistent with the longstanding

22

tenor of this Court's habeas jurisprudence, which

court judgment.

3

And Justice O'Connor,

I think you are correct to

4

note that a habeas action, this Court has long held, is a

5

civil action.

6

essence, is the plaintiff in the case, must make all the

7

showings necessary to justify relief, and this is, in

8

essence, an element of the claim necessary to show a

9

custody in violation of the Constitution.

That means that the petitioner, who, in

There must be a

10

causal link, as the Solicitor General submitted in the

11

brief for the United States, between the error and the

12

verdict to justify relief here.

13

QUESTION:

May I ask you if this was your view

14

prior to the decision in Brecht, because it was a civil

15

proceeding the harmless error inquiry burden was on the

16

petitioner?

17

MR. CORDRAY:

Your Honor,

I think that prior to

18

Brecht the general understanding, and I guess the Court

19

said in' Brecht it had not yet confronted it specifically,

20

was that the Chapman standard would be applied in these

21

cases.

MR. CORDRAY:

QUESTION:

I believe --

At that time, when that standard was

10

being applied in the civil proceeding, under your view,

11

who had the burden?

12

MR. CORDRAY:

Because this Court specifically

13

stated under the Chapman standard that the State had the

burden, the State did have the burden at that time.

MR. CORDRAY:

Yes, although that's not

19

It was an exception to the historical rule, and that's --

20

when the petitioner points to the traditional body of case

21

law, they're really only pointing to the Chapman case and

22

the Chapman approach, otherwise the consistent tenor of

But yet when Chapman was carried over

to a civil proceeding, a habeas proceeding, it was assumed

that the distribution of the persuasion burden would be

7

MR. CORDRAY:

Yes, but Your Honor, I think when

8

this Court in Brecht specifically confronted the issue and

9

said that the Chapman approach is not appropriate on

10

collateral review, it was setting aside the Chapman

11

approach, which was a criminal law formulation that the

State must show beyond a reasonable doubt, and instead was

MR. CORDRAY:

Because I think that with Chapman

3

the Court carried in a criminal law formulation, and I

4

think that the Court's application of Kotteakos both

5

before and since, Palmer v. Hoffman, McDonough Power, is

6

that in a civil proceeding the party seeking to set aside

7

the judgment must bear the burden of showing that the

8

error actually affected the result in the case such as to

9

influence its substantial rights, and that's the

10
11

appropriate formulation, we believe, in this case.
In particular, Justice Ginsburg, to return to

12

the question you asked of the petitioner, we do not

13

understand that the analysis here on this issue would be

14

an affirmative defense that the State must raise.

15

would not be consistent with the Court's habeas

16

jurisprudence.

17

That

Instead, what would be consistent is to treat it

18

as the Court has treated procedural default in McCleskey,

19

in Coleman, exhaustion in Granberry v. Greer, as a matter

20

that the State must raise, or it may waive it, but once

21

raised, the burden is on the petitioner to make the

showings necessary to justify relief, and we think that

that's what's consistent with the Court habeas

jurisprudence.

fundamental nature of these proceedings again is they are

2

collateral challenges to separate and distinct State court

3

judgments.

4

This Court has held in all such collateral

5

proceedings such as in Park v. Raley, two terms ago, that

6

the burden is on the parties seeking to challenge that

7

judgment, which is now presumed to be final, and the

8

presumption of finality has attached when it's been upheld

9

on direct appeal, to make the showings necessary to

10

justify setting aside that judgment, and it is also

11

consistent with this Court's touchstone principles of its

12

habeas jurisprudence, which stress that there are

13

interests that the State and its citizens share here that

14

are felt in very human terms by the State and its

15

citizens.

habeas and finality, it also goes to the rehabilitation of

2

the offender, because one who doesn't yet recognize that

3

they stand fully and finally convicted is not prepared to

4

undertake rehabilitation, and these are very important

5

interests that the State and its citizens feel, I would

stress, in very human terms.

7

And the presumption of finality, if it means

8

anything, means that when a petitioner has not succeeded

9

in showing that error identified at trial actually had an

effect on the jury's verdict, a substantial injurious

effect, it is not appropriate to presume, then, that the

There is a presumption that the State court

judgment should be upheld, rather than set aside, where

4

the petitioner has not succeeded in making all the

in a close case, that the State court judgment be set

Federal review of the issue, it is a de novo review

2

undertaken on the entire record in the case, and third,

3

and maybe most important, it is a matter of judgment that

4

involves a qualitative assessment of the effect of the

5

error on the jury's verdict, and not simply a simplistic

6

assessment of guilt, and it's those safeguards that the

7

lower courts have applied consistent with this Court's

8

Brecht decision.

9

And I think that petitioner's claim before this

10

Court is that if the burden of proof is placed here, as

11

the Court has consistently historically placed it in

12

habeas cases, excepting only the Chapman approach, that

13

there will somehow be an end to this Court's habeas

14

jurisprudence safeguarding the liberty rights of

15

offenders.

That is simply not the case.

16

The lower courts have faithfully applied Brecht

17

in the spirit of that decision, they have made this full,

18

de novo review on the record, they have granted writs

19

under this standard, in the Cumbie case out of the

20

Eleventh Circuit, the Jeffries case out of the Ninth

Circuit, cited in our brief, and we think that there are

those substantial safeguards built in for the petitioner,

General, though we don't have any statistical analysis,

this would be a narrow class of cases.

12

class of cases, we think this raises a very fundamental

point about the philosophy of this Court's jurisprudence,

which is, in the close case, are we going to, in the end,

presume that the State court judgment, separate and

distinct judgment, should be set aside, or are we going to

MR. CORDRAY:

Dating back to Adams v. United

where you have error, you don't know what effect it has on

the jury's verdict until a showing is made, and the Court

said it must be a substantial injurious effect, and

petitioner must make that showing to show that --

QUESTION:

You don't have a case that says, in

13

effect, what you've been saying, that even though there's

presumption nevertheless remains that the judgment should

MR. CORDRAY:

We think that all of the cases

this Court has decided on habeas -- Granberry v. Greer,

19

which is an exhaustion case, procedural default cases,

20

abuse of the writ cases, and all of those cases, there are

21

allegations and perhaps identification of error, but to

22

the point is that the petitioner must make the showings

23

necessary to justify relief, to show a causal link between

24

the error and the jury's verdict, such that we now can

QUESTION:

Does this apply even to what we have

called in some of our cases structural error?
MR. CORDRAY:

No, it does not.

There are some

5

errors, Your Honor, that the Court has recognized are

6

reversible per se.

7

However, what we're talking about here is the

8

class of errors that are constitutional trial errors where

9

the Court has said there must be a further showing that

10

the error actually affected the jury's verdict, and if

11

there's no such showing, if there is no such link drawn by

12

the petitioner in the case, then the State court judgment

13

should not be presumed to be set aside.

14

We think that that is consistent with the

15

longstanding tenor of this Court's habeas jurisprudence.

16

It's also consistent, again, with the nature of a habeas

17

proceeding as a civil action.

1

collateral review you either have had in the State courts

2

a Chapman-style review or --

3

MR. CORDRAY:

I think it raises, Your Honor, a

4

separate question, and this question was raised in the

5

petition for certiorari here as question 1, and it's a

6

question that some of the courts have wrestled with.

7

If there was no Chapman standard applied on

8

direct review, should it be Chapman, then, that is applied

9

on collateral review, and thus far the Court has declined

10

to take up that issue, and I think correctly, because the

11

Court laid down a single, consistent standard in Brecht

12

that should apply on all collateral review cases, but

13

that's -- I would stress here that that's a separate

14

question.

15

There was a question 1 in the petition for

16

certiorari which was denied review here, and so I don't

17

think that question is present in the case at this point.

18

At least, we've not briefed it or presented it to the

19

Court.

20

QUESTION:

That would remain an open question

21

however we decide this allocation of the burden of

persuasion?

23

MR. CORDRAY:

I think that's right, because the

1

that that is the Brecht standard that will apply on

2

collateral review, not the Chapman standard.

3

QUESTION:

If we rule your way, could a sound

4

argument be made in direct review Chapman cases that the

5

burden should, in fact, be in that case on the appellant,

6

because although you -- I mean, you have de novo review of

7

the strictly legal issue, the question of prejudice is not

8

that kind of an issue, and why shouldn't, if we go your

9

way here, why shouldn't the appellants likewise have the

10

burden to prove that in fact there was actual prejudice?
MR. CORDRAY:

11

I think here are two reasons, Your

12

Honor.

The first is that on a direct review you have an

13

appeal that is a continuation, a direct continuation of

14

the underlying criminal proceeding, and so the criminal

15

law formulation of Chapman --

16

QUESTION:

Well, except that it -- you say it's

17

a direct continuation, but the parties don't stand in the

18

same relation to each other in terms of their obligations

19

to go forward.

20

There is at least an intellectual burden that

21

has to be satisfied by the appellant to prove that there

22

was legal error, so they're not in the same spot they're

23

in at the moment the jury's empaneled.

24
25

MR. CORDRAY:

I think those observations are

correct, Your Honor.

There might be some argument made, but I think

1
2

that neither of the arguments would really apply with much

3

force in that setting because the appeal there is a

4

continuation of the underlying criminal proceeding.

5

It also is not a collateral challenge.

QUESTION:

That's kind of -- isn't that sort of

7

begging the question?

8

we don't -- why should we have a rule that assumes

9

prejudice?

10

MR. CORDRAY:

The question is, should it be, and

I think that, as Your Honor

11

indicates, that is a separate question as to whether

12

Chapman is an appropriate standard on direct review.

3

The State does not challenge that, and neither

4

do we think that either of the arguments we are resting so

5

heavily on here really would apply to suggest that Chapman

6

is inappropriate on direct review, because that is still a

7

criminal proceeding, and it also doesn't involve a

8

collateral challenge to a separate and distinct judgment.

9

And I think that in particular the Court here

20

has indicated that on a 2254 proceeding, the rules this

21

Court has adopted implementing 2254, Rule

22

points the courts to draw upon the Federal civil rules in

23

these kinds of cases, and the Federal civil rules, as I

24

indicated, have always been applied going back to Palmer

QUESTION:

1

So you really think that probably the

2

strongest answer, then, to my question is one of statutory

3

interpretation.

4

MR. CORDRAY:

I think that the Court --my sense

5

would be the Court would consider that it has directly

6

considered the Chapman standard on direct review of

7

criminal cases, and considers that to be the correct

8

approach.

9

QUESTION:

I thought your answer to that was

10

that in direct review the question is whether the

11

conviction was proper, whereas on collateral review the

12

question is whether the individual is being held in

13

violation of the Federal Constitution, and if the latter

14

is true, only where he makes a showing not only that there

15

was a mistake in the conviction, but also when he makes a

16

showing that that mistake led to his incarceration.

It's really a different question on direct
review, isn't it?
MR. CORDRAY:

I agree, and those are the things

I'm trying to say, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

It's the habeas statute that makes

the difference.
MR. CORDRAY:

Yes, I agree, and I'm trying to

articulate that.

Well, are you then saying

1

it's -- basically it's a question of statutory

2

construction, that so far as the so-called policy

3

arguments might go, you could make just as strong an

4

argument for placing the burden on the appellant under

5

Chapman as you can for placing the burden on the

6

petitioner here under Kotteakos?

7

MR. CORDRAY:

I don't believe so, Your Honor,

8

because the policy arguments, or the fundamental

9

touchstone interest this Court has stressed applying

10
11

collateral review of on habeas proceedings are distinct.
The presumption of finality only attaches once a

12

conviction has been upheld all the way on direct appeal,

13

and only then do the interests that I attempted to

14

articulate of the deterrent effect of the criminal laws,

15

the public confidence in the judicial system that this

16

Court stressed in Brecht and has stressed in a number of

17

cases, really do begin to apply, as this Court has said,

18

once the case goes over to collateral review in a distinct

19

proceeding, and so I think that is a distinct matter.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

Mr. Cordray, you don't have much time

left, and I wanted to ask a different sort of question.
As this case comes to us from the Sixth Circuit,

23

do you think the Sixth Circuit found there was a

24

constitutional error in the instruction?

25

MR. CORDRAY:

No, Your Honor.
35

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.
SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

I think it's very

1

clear from the Sixth Circuit's decision that first of all

2

they found that there was no error in the jury

3

instruction.

4

It was a proper -- perhaps not ideal, but a

5

proper statement of Ohio law and complicity and conspiracy

6

that intent to kill can be presumed from circumstances,

7

including a common design to enter into a crime that is

8

reasonably likely to cause the death of the victim.

9

However, more than that, the Court only assumed

10

arguendo that there was error, perhaps, in a combination

11

of jury instruction with prosecutorial comment, and so if

12

the Court were to disagree with us as to the allocation of

13

burden of proof, we think both sides would agree that

14

remand would be appropriate first for the Sixth Circuit to

15

actually determine if there was error, and second,

16

whether, under a different allocation of burden of proof,

17

that the verdict should be upheld nonetheless.

18

But again, we think that it is very clear that

19

in a collateral challenge, a civil action habeas

20

proceeding, the burden should be allocated here to the

21

habeas petitioner to make the showing necessary to justify

22

relief, to show that the presumption of finality should be

23

set aside, and that that's consistent with the Court's

24

view of habeas proceedings as only correcting extreme

25

malfunctions in the State court process that have

1

grievously wronged an offender.

2

If the habeas petitioner is unable to show that

3

error actually had effect on the jury's verdict, actually

4

had a substantial injurious effect, we would submit that

5

the State court system has not extremely malfunctioned, it

6

has not grievously wronged the habeas petitioner.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Cordray, if the petitioner were

8

to prevail here, would there be a significant practical

9

effect on the work load of the State prosecutors in

10
11

12

defending against habeas applications?
MR. CORDRAY:

I don't think that the allocation

of the burden would affect the work load one way or the

3

other, because both parties always have every incentive to

4

present their best arguments as to whether there is error,

5

and as to whether that error actually had an effect on the

6

jury's verdict.

7

What it will affect is the approach that State

8

courts -- that Federal courts take philosophically whether

9

they should set aside State judgments merely based on a

20

presumption or instead should accord them the presumption

21

of finality that this Court has stressed so long and so

22

consistently.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

2

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

3

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

4
5
6

MR. FELDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Our position is that the habeas petitioner

7

should bear the burden of proof as to harmless error.

8

That's not based on an analysis of section 2111, the

9

harmless error statute, or the Federal Rules of Civil or

10

Criminal Procedure, because in our view those rules were

11

primarily designed to deal with errors that occur in a

12

Federal proceeding from the time the proceeding was

13

started until the time the court is asked to assess the

14

effect of some error that's occurred.

15

Instead, it's based on the fact -- this case

16

does not involve that kind of a situation.

17

occurred here occurred in a State court proceeding that

18

was finished and came to final judgment before the Federal

19

proceeding was instituted.

20

The error that

In those circumstances, in our view the crucial

21

point is that there has been a final judgment in the prior

22

proceeding, and that that is what is being attacked.

23

habeas petitioner bears the burden of proving that an

24

error was committed in that proceeding, and for

25

essentially the same reasons, we think the habeas
38

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

The

1

petitioner bears the burden also of showing that that

2

error was not harmless, that it had some effect on the

3

outcome.

4

QUESTION:

Do you agree that the practical

5

consequences of a decision one way or another are slight?

6

That is, that there are not many cases where the trier is

7

in equipoise about the linkage between the constitutional

8

violation and the impact on the conviction?

9

MR. FELDMAN:

Yes, I would agree with that, if

10

what you're talking about is the number of cases that are

11

likely to be affected.

12

I can't give you an empirical survey, or

13

empirical results, but if you look through F.2d, and look

14

through appellate decisions, there are dozens of appellate

15

decisions that have addressed harmless error after having

16

found error on habeas.

17

the concept of burden of proof, and at least my sense of

18

looking at them is that it's not ordinarily the decisive

19

question, so I don't think it would affect a very large

20

number of cases.

21

Most of them don't even mention

On the other hand, in cases where it will affect

22

things, it can have -- it can be a very extremely

23

important issue.

24

petitioner was originally tried 14 years ago.

25

possibilities of retrying him at this time, it would be

In this case, for instance, the

39

The

1

very difficult, and the confidence in the outcome of that

2

proceeding that would result in a just conviction if he

3

turned out to be -- if he was guilty would be severe.

4

It's for those reasons that the habeas corpus

5

statute specifically speaks in terms of the -- what the

6

petitioner must show is that he's in custody in violation

7

of the Constitution, not that he's in custody pursuant to

8

a judgment rendered at a trial at which a constitutional

9

error occurred.

10

In our view, because he must be shown to be in

11

custody in violation of the Constitution, that imports a

12

notion of causation which is essentially what --

13

QUESTION:

But isn't it odd to extract a burden

14

of proof rule from a statute that doesn't even tell us

15

what the substantive standard is in this?

16

MR. FELDMAN:

I wouldn't -- what I would extract

17

from that is simply that the claim that the habeas

18

petitioner must make out is that he's in custody in

19

violation of the Constitution, and that it is an element

20

of that claim.

21

His custody isn't a violation of the

22

Constitution unless there was an error that occurred and

23

that error had some relationship to his custody.

24

the error caused his custody in some sense, and that, in

25

that sense, is what the harmless error rules are about.
40

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

That is,

It is because that is one element of his claim

1

2

that he must show that it's up to the -- it's because it's

3

an element of his claim that he must make that he must

4

make the -- carry the burden of proof as to harmless

5

error.

6

QUESTION:

Of course, you could really run the

7

same argument on direct appeal, too,

8

say that it's the burden of the convicted defendant to

9

show that the conviction was a result of the error of law,

I suppose.

You could

10

not merely that there was an error, but that the

11

conviction was improper, and the conviction, you could

12

say, was not improper unless you show that the error of

13

law produced the conviction, and yet we don't say that.

14

mean, you could run the same argument.

15

MR. FELDMAN:

I suppose you could.

I

I mean, I

16

think, first, all of the policies that this Court has

17

referred to time and time again about the very great cost

18

imposed by habeas relief would not apply in a situation of

19

direct teview.

20

I think also the Court's repeatedly said habeas

21

is not supposed to serve the function of a direct appeal.

22

And I would finally point out that Rule 52(a) of the Rules

23

of Criminal Procedure has been interpreted by this Court

24

to put the burden of proof on the Government of showing

25

harmless error once there's been an error that's been

1

shown by the defendant.
So I think that's squarely governed by those

2

3

rules.

4

when the court is in equipoise as to whether or not an

5

error had a substantial and injurious effect on the

6

verdict, it may be reasonable for that court to overturn

7

the conviction and send it back for a new trial.

8

9

It may be reasonable on direct review for a court,

But on habeas, where the court is not able
positively to state that the error did have such a

10

substantial injurious effect on the verdict,

11

the petitioner hasn't made out his claim and that the

12

habeas petition should be denied.

13

I think that

Petitioner has argued that the result in this

14

case will affect the procedures, and that there's -- I

15

disagree with the petitioner that there is a procedural

16

rule that a court has to determine either harmless error

17

or whether the error occurred, in what order the court has

18

to determine those two questions.

19

A court can reasonably act by assuming that an

20

error has occurred and asking itself whether it's

21

harmless, or they can find out whether the error occurred

22

and then conduct a harmless error review.

23

that the order of proof will be affected by the result in

24

this case, nor do I think that the introduction of

25

evidence, or the burdens of showing what facts might be

2

Well, wouldn't it be affected to this

3

extent, that if you take seriously the language about

looking at the entire record and weighing it against the

5

entire record, that somebody has to decide whether it's

6

worth the judge's time to say, let's look at the whole

7

record in this case?
If you go with the petitioner, the Government

8

9

has to make up its mind that it thinks its worth the

10

effort.

11

the effort, then the judge just goes ahead and grants

12

relief.

13

If they don't, neither side decides it's worth

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, as I understand the

14

question, if you're referring to a burden of production,

15

it's not really the question that we've addressed.

16

I'm not sure that I would agree that that's

17

vital, because I think the issue will inevitably surface,

but what we're really -- the issue that I'm more

interested in in this case is, who bears the risk of

That is, where the court as a substantive

QUESTION:

Well, that's right.

does bear the risk, presumably it won't raise -- make a

1

good basis for asking the judge to read this whole record.
MR. FELDMAN:

2

Well,

I don't -- I think if the

3

Government approaches the case and finds that an error has

4

been committed, I don't think it should ask the court to

5

conduct a harmless error analysis unless it can conclude

6

that that analysis --

7

QUESTION:

But you're saying the plaintiff in

8

every case should ask the judge to conduct a harmless

9

error -- to be sure he is -- that it's not harmless.

10

MR. FELDMAN:

11

QUESTION:

I think --

Your view would require the judge in

12

every case to read the record and conduct harmless error

13

review.

14

MR. FELDMAN:

I think if the petitioner -- I

15

think if the petitioner views -- thinks that that's a

sound claim that he ought to be making, that I think --

yeah, I think --

QUESTION:

Well, but I mean, he's going to have

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, I

think petitioner -- I think that is because there has been

22

already a final judgment in the case.

QUESTION:

I understand why, but I think there

24

is a very significant difference in work load on the court

1

think it's -- thinks it's close enough so they're probably

2

not going to prevail on harmless error, they just don't

3

ask the judge to read the record, but the petitioner would

4

always have to ask him to do it.

5

MR. FELDMAN:

I think ordinarily, once there's

6

been a final conviction that's been affirmed and you're on

7

habeas, ordinarily the Government will take the position

8

that that conviction is valid and will litigate the

9

harmless error issue if there's a good reason to litigate

10

it.
QUESTION:

11

Well, of course, no -- I take it that

12

the trial court also has the option to say -- to address

13

the constitutional issue first and say there's no

14

constitutional violation, in which case he doesn't have to

15

read the record at all.

16

MR. FELDMAN:

Right, I agree.

Of course, that

17

would be the -- I think that is certainly the ordinary way

18

of proceeding, but I just wanted to make the point before

19

that I don't think it's the exclusive or required way for

20

the court to proceed.
QUESTION:

21

And I should think if there is a

22

constitutional violation, then he's going to have to read

23

the record, and one party or the other has the burden to

24

persuade.

25

MR. FELDMAN:

That's right.

I agree.

In this Court's decision in Brecht v.

2

Abrahamson, the Court did say that it adopted -- in

3

adopting the Kotteakos standard that lower Federal courts

4

will have a substantial -- will have an understanding of

5

what that standard means, because there's been a lot of

6

case law that's developed around it, but I think that when

7

the Court said that, it certainly did not say that that

8

was compelled by the harmless error statute or by the

9

Federal rules, certainly not by the Federal Rules of

Nor was it addressing the burden of proof issue.

Indeed, as to that point, the experience of the lower

think it was a sufficient condition, and I certainly

21

wouldn't read into that any statement about the allocation

22

of the burden of proof on the issue.

23

It was just that this standard, substantial and

injurious effect on the verdict, was something that the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS R. WETTERER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. WETTERER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

9

There was a constitutional violation found by

10

the Sixth Circuit.

11

traditionally, when it's reviewing the record and

12

determines there's no constitutional violations, gives

13

short shrift and says, there's no constitutional violation

14

here, and then dismisses the case in its opinion.

15

The court -- the Sixth Circuit

The court of appeals in this particular case in

16

the last two pages of the opinion found that some of the

17

errors the petitioner raised did not raise to a

18

constitutional level, and therefore they indicated they

19

weren'tâ€™ going to even analyze them.

20

Under the Boyde standard adopted by this Court

21

for determination of a jury instruction, the court does

22

not look only at the jury instruction, but has to look at

23

how the jury instruction is used by the court, by the

24

parties in this particular case, and Boyde, even though in

25

this case the jury instruction alone was not a violation,

1

it became a constitutional violation when it was used by

2

the court in this manner, and in response to the

3

prosecutor's comments.

4

In the record below, there will be a

5

demonstration that there was three instances in the

6

closing argument of the prosecutor in which he made

7

references to transferred intent arguments to the jury,

8

and that the court, in its original charge, made at least

9

six references to the ability to transfer intent, and at

10

least three references in a supplemental charge which was

11

given after the jury was given -- asked a question about

12

reasonable doubt.

13

In Mr. O'Neal's case, the prosecution made a

14

very gruesome argument to the jury, and asked them to go

15

back in the room, put the clothes on, walk around and

16

think about what it would be like to hit at someone in the

17

head with a crowbar, and that they should find these

18

parties guilty.

19

If the jury really believed at that point the

20

best evidence of guilt, Toney's, then there would have

21

been no reason to come back and ask for any further

22

instructions, because under the State's theory, the best

23

theory the State had was that Mr. O'Neal killed

24

Mr. Podborny with the help of his assistant, and that

25

Mrs. Podborny had paid for that to be done, and that there

were other people that verified Mrs. O'Neal's --

2

Mrs. Podborny's story, but there was no one to tie --

3

O'Neal's issue was very substantially in doubt.

4

But the jury came back, and they asked for more

5

that Mr. O'Neal was factually innocent, they had to find

8

him guilty based on the intent of others that had been

convicted in an earlier proceeding.

administration of justice, and in this case, it goes hand-

2

in-hand, because if the Court were to place the burden

3

upon this petitioner and other petitioners, it would

4

extremely complicate the process and would make it a

5

burden upon the district courts at all levels to determine

6

what constitutes the Constitution.

Every individual should know what constitutes a

constitutional violation, whether on direct review or

12

QUESTION:

This Court -Why would ruling in favor of the

State here complicate the task of the district courts?
MR. WETTERER:

Because every petitioner after

13

this case would have to plead fact specifics in the record

14

to demonstrate why this error had an impact, how it was

15

substantially egregious, besides alleging his

16

constitutional violation.

17

At that point, the court would then have to

18

decide whether he sufficiently raised facts to warrant the

19

issue of a show-cause order.

20

QUESTION:

But isn't the Government going to be

21

doing that on the other side if the burden of proof is

22

placed otherwise?

23

MR. WETTERER:

No, Your Honor.

constitutional violation.

QUESTION:

At that point, the court

If he's --

There was some -- before Brecht,

6

there was some form of harmless error applied in habeas

7

corpus, but you say -- but that was never taken into

8

consideration in the drafting of the petition.

9

MR. WETTERER:

Unless it was an issue in which

10

it was overwhelmingly a stupid issue raised by the

11

petitioner and a claim that wouldn't affect the case, then

12

the courts would not issue a show cause order.

13

But once a show cause order is issued, then they

14

have to file a return of writ, and then the court looks at

15

the record, and at that point, even before determining the

16

merits of the claim, if the court has to look at the whole

17

record, as Justice Stevens indicates, that's going to

18

complicate the process to determine whether or not there's

19

a constitutional error.

20

QUESTION:

Why wouldn't the court first look at

21

the merits of the constitutional claim, particularly if

22

it's as difficult as you say to look into the harmless

23

error aspect?

those are two separate issues, constitutional claim, and

whether or not there's -QUESTION:

3

Yes, but you're trying to show that

4

the district court's task will be tremendously complicated

5

if we don't rule in your favor, and you're saying, because

6

they're going to have to immediately look to see whether

7

there was any effect of the alleged constitutional error.

8

You're suggesting they would decide the harmless error

see why.
MR. WETTERER:

It would become part and parcel

of the constitutional claim.
QUESTION:

It's still -- however we decide this,

14

it's part and parcel of the constitutional question.

15

Whether the burden of proving the Kotteakos standard was

16

met is on your client or on the State, it's still part of

17

the constitutional question.

18

MR. WETTERER:

It's part of the determination of

19

whether'to grant relief, but if the court does not find a

20

constitutional violation, regardless of reviewing the

21

record, if he looks at the violation and says, this does

22

not violate the Constitution, then he doesn't have to get

23

to the constitutional issue.

Correct, Your Honor.

Whereas, if you take the other view,

at least he can issue the rule to show cause, and then
they bring in the harmless error inquiry.
MR. WETTERER:

The Court can focus on just

point, and that makes it a lot simpler process.
