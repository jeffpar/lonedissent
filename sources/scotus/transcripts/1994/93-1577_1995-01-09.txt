ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD G. MULACK

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MULACK:

11

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
We'd like to emphasize two points in argument

12

this morning.

13

facially or otherwise prohibit the registration of color

14

as a trademark.

15

which distinguishes goods of one manufacturer from another

16

to function as a trademark.

17

The first is that the Lanham Act does not

In fact, it permits any symbol or device

The second point is that both the Patent &

18

Trademark Office and the district court found as a factual

19

matter that Qualitex established a trademark after 30

20

years of exclusive use of the green-gold color.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Mulack -- Mr. Mulack, the Lanham

22

Act defines trademark to include any word name, symbol, or

23

device, or any combination.

24

into that definition?

25

MR. MULACK:

Where do you think color fits

Color is a symbol.

It must be the same.
And yet the Ninth Circuit appeared to

allow trade dress here but said it couldn't be registered

19

as a trademark.

20

They kind of split the baby, didn't they?

MR. MULACK:

Yes, and that is quite baffling and

21

quite astounding in the sense that the Lanham Act does not

22

prohibit the registration of color.

23

QUESTION:

I thought that in the Two Pesos case

we said that a trade dress could be so inherently

distinctive that no secondary meaning was required.

MR. MULACK:

2

QUESTION:

That is correct.
But I thought you had just -- I

3

thought you had just answered Justice O'Connor, and these

4

are background questions, I suppose, that a secondary

5

meaning is required?

6

MR. MULACK:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. MULACK:

9

Well, that's correct.
And -In the case, though, that you -- if

you have an inherently distinctive product you do not

10

have -- in terms of a distinctive trademark you do not

11

have to prove secondary meaning, but the point is that

12

globally I was responding to Justice O'Connor's question

13

about the very basic questions of proving that there is a

14

designation of a source, that one source is particularly

15

recognized -- is the manufacturer of the product.

16

QUESTION:

Well, let me just make sure that I

17

understand it.

18

Pesos, there can be a trade dress that is so distinctive

19

that no secondary meaning is required?

For a trade dress, per our decision in Two

20

MR. MULACK:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. MULACK:

Correct.
Can the same thing happen with color?
Well, I would have to say it's a

23

facts-and-circumstance test, Your Honor.

24

to prove that this color is, indeed, acting as an indicia

25

of source, and if it doesn't so prove through the facts

QUESTION:

So then color can be so distinctive

you can at least imagine a case in which no secondary

MR. MULACK:

Well, Your Honor, that's kind of

close.

green-gold color, and that is -- it is very distinctive.

9

It's --

In our particular case, as you know, we have a

QUESTION:

10

I understand that, but as part of

11

these initial questions, I thought you said to Justice

12

O'Connor that for all purposes of this case, and for our

13

consideration, trade dress and color as a trademark are

14

the same, and you also said that a secondary meaning is

15

always required, but that is not what we said in Two

16

Pesos, so I'm still confused.

17

MR. MULACK:

Well, I'm sorry if I wasn't clear

18

in my answers.

not require secondary meaning.

trademarks do not require a secondary meaning.

Is it possible that for pure color to be

2

protectable either as trade dress or for a registered

mark, that there has to have been secondary meaning

acquired?

MR. MULACK:

Well, we're -Is that possible because of the

difference?
MR. MULACK:

Well, because of the difference,

color in our particular case must have acquired secondary

meaning through a long use, so it recognizes and dis -QUESTION:

11

What does that mean in your

12

particular case?

I mean, the question is -- I still don't

13

understand what your posi -- I had understood from your

14

brief,

15

that the proposition of law you are urging upon us is that

16

color can be protectable as a trademark only if it has

17

acquired a secondary meaning.

I certainly understand from the Government's brief,

18

Now, I gather you no longer say that, and you

1

disagree with the Government, and you think color can be

20

protectable even if it has not acquired a secondary

21

meaning.

If color has acquired secondary

can it be protected as a trademark?

If it is not inherently

distinctive, no, it cannot.

Well, can --

-- a middle step there that --

No, don't put the "if."

I mean, you

8

think in some situations, however, it can be protected as

a trademark even if it has acquired no secondary meaning.

10

Is that your position?
MR. MULACK:

11

I am -- I would say only if it is

12

inherently distinctive, and that is a facts-and-

13

circumstance --

14

QUESTION:

But that could exist, so there are

15

some situations where color can be protected as a

trademark without having acquired a secondary meaning.

That's your position.

Justice Ginsburg, we are not attempting to appropriate

11

color generally across the board to apply to every product

12

13

Office for this green-gold color as applied in a limited

area, to press pads only.

MR. MULACK:

That's exactly, right, and we did

do that in the trial court.
QUESTION:

No, but aren't you also saying, or

23

aren't you at least implying, that with a sufficiently

24

unusual color, combined with an ironing board pad, it may

25

not be necessary to establish secondary meaning by usage?

1

Aren't you impliedly saying there's a difference

2

between -- if I walk into the registration office, there's

3

a difference between trying to register the sort of bland,

4

neutral color of some undyed ironing board pad as distinct

5

from registering the unusual color that you've got, and if

6

the unusual color that you've got applied to an ironing

7

board pad is sufficiently distinctive, you don't have to

8

acquire secondary meaning in order to register it?

9

that what you were implying before?
MR. MULACK:

10

Is

Well, Your Honor, I suppose if we

11

would extend it to that point, yes, but we have not

12

addressed it in that particular manner in our briefs to

13

say that it is inherently distinctive per se.

established --

15

QUESTION:

We have

But you do take the position that

16

there can be combinations of color and product that may be

17

registered without acquiring a secondary meaning first?

18

MR. MULACK:

Well, now, Your Honor, combinations

19

of color or product, that's entirely different than a

20

sole --

QUESTION:

Well,

I thought that's -- I thought

22

your answer to Justice Ginsburg was that that's what we

23

were talking about.

MR. MULACK:

I didn't believe we were talking

about combinations of colors.

These are words of art.

QUESTION:

So if I happen to like lime yellow,

15

for example, which I think is a beautiful color, you all

16

could go around and get monopolies of it, and henceforth

17

products wouldn't have lime yellow on them because you and

18

other people would have tied them all up with trademarks?

19

At least they wouldn't have lime yellow on them if -- why

20

do you need to take all the lime yellow, anyway?

21

(Laughter.)

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

I mean, if somebody copies your

appearance they get a trade dress suit.
MR. MULACK:

1

different colors have been used over the course of the

2

years.

3

that Qualitex has used.

4

No one has ever used this unique green-gold color

QUESTION:

Would you explain the protection that

5

you get from having a trademark of this color on this pad

6

that you don't get from trade dress?

7

MR. MULACK:

Yes.

With respect to a trademark

8

registration, certain rights are conferred by the statute,

9

namely, incontestability of that mark after 5 years.

You

10

have a right to constructive notice that anyone that may

11

use this product throughout the country is put on

12

constructive notice that it's being used and you better

13

not infringe based upon the registration.

14

Thirdly, there's also an importation clause that

15

allows us to stop at the borders the importation of

16

counterfeit goods just by showing the registration, which

17

is quite important to Qualitex today and other

18

manufacturers because of the importation of knock-off

19

goods, if you will.

20

So you get those three benefits, in addition to

21

others, that you don't get in a straight trade dress case,

22

and you also -- the big benefit is to the public, in the

23

sense that there's a central registry.

24

as to this particular color or this particular trademark

25

being used by a particular manufacturer, and the members

There's a registry

of the public then know where to check to see if, indeed,

2

a particular color is being used or has been trademarked.

3

QUESTION:

May I ask you --

4

QUESTION:

Doesn't trade dress give you enough

5

protection in case somebody copies your appearance?
My real question was the problem of exhausting

6

7

colors.

8

I take it there are a finite number of attractive colors,

9

and so what is the reason why it's important to industry

There are infinite numbers of beautiful designs.

10

to be able to tie up with a trademark one of what I would

11

think would be a fairly limited number of attractive

12

colors?

13

Why doesn't using a symbol, or the trade dress

14

protection, give adequate protection for any legitimate

15

purpose that industry might have?

16

MR. MULACK:

Well, as I mentioned, trademarking

17

a particular color helps confusion in the marketplace.

18

Consumers know when they see this same color, or this

19

mark, that they're getting the quality goods that they

20

expected to obtain, and it's no monopoly whatsoever in

21

that respect.

This case --

MR. MULACK:

No, Justice Stevens, we have no

interest in protecting this particular color against any

You're not

You're asking for a

monopoly on the color used on this particular ironing pad.

11

Why is that different from a trademark on this color in a

12

triangle, for example?

13

MR. MULACK:

Well, that -- that is a -- that is

14

a symbol attached to a color which may create a trademark.

15

It's different because our whole pad is in this one

That is precisely what we'd like to

that the Lanham Act allows color as a trademark.

There is a dual nature to the interest of the

1
2

United States in this case.

On the one hand, we urge the

3

Court to uphold the interpretation of the Patent &

4

Trademark Office that the overall color of a particular

5

product, not the color in the abstract, but the color of a

6

particular product, or of a container in which the product

7

is marketed, can qualify under the standards of the Lanham

8

Act for registration as a trademark, and this case

9

provides a textbook example of how it can qualify through

10

the establishment of secondary meaning and

11

nonfunctionality, a rather strong showing in this case.
On the other hand, we urge the Court not to

12

13

undermine the rather exacting standards that the Patent &

14

Trademark Office applies, and that we think are properly

15

applied under ordinary principles of trademark law when

16

it, or a reviewing court is considering whether an

17

applicant has established the right to register a

18

trademark.

19

In its 1993 second edition Trademark Manual of

20

Examining Procedure, which we have cited and quoted a bit

21

of in our brief, there is a whole section devoted to the

22

question of color as a trademark.

However, color can function as a trademark if it

is used in order to identify the source and if it is

must submit evidence to the examiner that the proposed

you'd be entitled to a trademark?

MR. STRICK:

That's what that would mean.

That's your position, that if they're

6

right, that you don't really need all the secondary

7

meanings.

8

9

MR. STRICK:

That's correct.

They just walk in

and get a trademark, even if what they're really talking

10

about is trade dress, and even if it's not inherently

11

distinctive trade dress, which would require an

12

affirmative showing of secondary meaning under the Two

Pesos case.
QUESTION:

Well, so then you're saying that no

6

registration.

7

MR. STRICK:

Section 2 requires a showing of

8

secondary meaning only with respect to descriptive marks,

9

as the Two Pesos case pointed out, and the reason why they

20

did not graft on to section 43(a) requirement for

21

secondary meaning for inherently distinctive trade dress

22

is because section 2 doesn't require it except for

23

descriptive marks, if it's arbitrary, fanciful,

24

suggestive, et cetera, that section 2 does not require a

25

showing of secondary meaning for registrability, only if

1

it's the weakest form of mark, in essence, a descriptive

2

mark.

3

The position adopted by petitioner in this case

4

would turn that, I think, on its head, because they would

5

be able -- and be at tension with Two Pesos, because they

6

would in essence be able to register that which might not

7

have been protectable as trade dress absent a showing of

8

secondary meaning, and we've pointed out that --

9

QUESTION:

Well, if you say that color can't be

10

inherently distinctive, so that what we have here is

11

something descriptive in the minds of the buyers?

12

under our Two Pesos case, and other authorities as well,

13

there would have to be secondary meaning to make it

14

protectable.

15

MR. STRICK:

16

QUESTION:

Then

That's correct.
So I think maybe that's the rationale

17

of the Patent & Trademark Office, to say color isn't

18

inherently distinctive, it's part of the public domain,

19

but if it's descriptive as applied to a product, it can be

20

registered provided secondary meaning is established and

21

provided it's nonfunctional, and isn't it true that very

22

few items will be found where color is nonfunctional?

23

guess an aesthetic use or purpose of color makes it

24

functional.

2

functionality test really seems to have lost its way in

3

the law, and it really isn't used -- it isn't used in the

4

Ninth Circuit any more, for example --we did show out

there was a nonaesthetic function, in essence, for the use

of color on press pads, a finding that was not persuasive

either to the district court or to the Ninth Circuit.

use of color may be functional, but not the particular

But the point that both courts made, however,

was it was this particular -- there was no need shown for

this particular shade of green, and therefore it was

serving a source-identifying feature, not a functional

But there -- most, I think, examples of the use

red, so if I'm going to search the principal register to

4

see if a client of mine's color is going to infringe a

registered color, and I see a lining for red, I don't know

what shade that is.

8

me sufficient notice of what color we're talking about?

For example, the

I couldn't help notice at counsel table I've got

a handful of amicus briefs in light green, I've got

another shade of green here -- these are pretty clearly

different, but the pen blotter that counsel are provided

15

at table is pretty close to this green, and as you get

16

into those kinds of issues, I think you're dealing in an

17

area where both the trademark office and perhaps even the

law is not really prepared to exist.

1

verbal description that is sufficient in and of itself to

2

determine infringement, are you?
MR. STRICK:

3

No, I'm not, Justice Kennedy.

What

4

I'm saying is, you've got a traditional situation where

5

I'm going to search the principal register and compare my

6

client's proposed mark with a registered mark, I'm going

7

to see words, I'm going to see a symbol or a design, and

8

that symbol or design may or may not have lining codes

9

which the trademark office uses to connote different

10
11

colors.
Now, I can look at the symbol or the words and

12

say, whoops, my client's mark is going to infringe that,

13

irrespective of the color, or irrespective of whether

14

we've changed the color.

15

What I'm saying is, when you have a registration

16

that says green-gold for press pads, I don't know what the

17

registration is talking about, and the lining codes may

18

not help because it doesn't tell me what shade of green,

19

what shade of red, what shade of blue.

20

QUESTION:

Well, before you yield some opinions

21

as to some devices, I assume you would have to identify

22

the precise color on the registered device by looking at

23

the mark itself, not just some verbal description of it.

That's correct.

In this case it

I would have to go out and buy a press pad and

then say, okay, this color does or does not --my

5

appliance color does or does not infringe, and I think

6

that's the essence of what I'm saying, and I think it's

7

the essence of the question that Justice Scalia posed:

8

why doesn't trade dress, then, therefore become

9

registrable?

10

Under the view adopted by Qualitex, there's

11

going to be no difference between trademarks as I've

12

traditionally understood it in 18 years of practice and

13

trade dress, which encompasses a whole host of features

14

separate and apart from the logo, symbol, device, or

15

design a manufacturer may use to differentiate his goods

16

from the goods of a competitor, and I think that opens a

17

host of problems that are unnecessary, particularly when

18

color is already protectable either as part of a logo or

19

as trade dress under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act.

I agree with the view that the

descriptive, because you have to describe it to describe
