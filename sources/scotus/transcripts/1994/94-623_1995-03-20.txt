ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. McDERMOTT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

13

This case is before the Court on a writ of

14

certiorari to the First Circuit Court of Appeals and

15

concerns a perceived conflict between the Carriage of

16

Goods by Sea Act and the Federal Arbitration Act.

17

case arises from the sale of a cargo of oranges which was

18

shipped from Morocco to Massachusetts.

19

The

Petitioners subrogated underwriter of the

20

purchaser of the cargo, and respondents are the vessel

21

owner and the ship in rem.

22

Among the commercial documents that the

23

purchaser received from the shipper when it purchased the

24

cargo was an ocean bill of lading that the vessel's agents

25

had issued to the shipper in Morocco.

Included in the

fine print boilerplate clauses of the bill of lading was a

Japanese law clause and a Tokyo arbitration clause.

purchaser first had notice of these clauses when it

received the bill of lading from its bank, after it had

paid for the goods.

terms were fait accompli.

Respondents moved under Chapter 1 of the FAA to stay the

was invalid as a prohibited lessening of the carrier's

liability under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act.

QUESTION:

Mr. McDermott, is Japan a signatory

to the Hague Rule?

MR. McDERMOTT:

17

QUESTION:

Yes, it is.

And do we know whether Japan's law

18

differs significantly from U.S. law with regard to

19

liability?

20

MR. McDERMOTT:

As -- in this case, we believe

21

it does, because we do not believe that the Japanese Hague

22

Rules impose on the vessel owner the nondelegable

obligation to load and stow the cargo carefully.

12

court for purposes of ultimate review under whatever the

13

standard is of review for arbitration?

14

MR. McDERMOTT:

Well,

the district court would

15

retain jurisdiction of the case, not least because it has

16

in rem jurisdiction over the ship,

17

opportunity, after the arbitration in Japan were

concluded,

20

the law,

so there is always the

to come back to the court here and,

for example,

for one

to seek vacation of the award.

What the First Circuit did,

in answer to Justice

22

Souter's question, was simply defer the issue of what

23

choice of law the arbitrators would apply.

24

petitioners' position that there is simply no choice of

25

law issue in this case, because COGSA itself applies to

That may be the result, but

here, respondents' own expert, a Japanese lawyer, has

stated in an affidavit that the Japanese Hague Rules would

QUESTION:

Is it clear that the application of

foreign law is prohibited by COGSA, if foreign law is the

24

same as COGSA itself?

MR. McDERMOTT:

1

No, we do not have a case where

2

it is identical, but we do have in this case a statute

3

which says that COGSA, this COGSA applies as a matter of

4

law.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. McDermott, isn't it an anomaly

6

that in COGSA we are modeling our domestic law on an

7

international model -- the whole purpose of it, wasn't it,

8

of the Hague Rules, was to achieve greater uniformity in

9

these bills of lading -- and then to say we, on the

10

substantive side we're trying to get greater uniformity

11

within the international community, and then say, but we

12

don't trust foreign fora?

13

MR. McDERMOTT:

14

trust, Justice Ginsburg.

It's not so much an issue of

15

The - - what Congress did when it enacted COGSA

16

was yes, to model our COGSA to the American COGSA on the

17

Hague Rules, but it nevertheless said that our statute

18

shall apply to bills of lading in United States trade, and

19

yes, it is true that it brought uniformity to

20

international commerce, but that did not give the courts

21

here in the United States license to disregard what is our

22

statute, and all of the jurisprudence which has been

23

developed over the last 60 years which supports what our

24

interpretation of COGSA is.

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

In fact the Bremen v. Zapata case

suggests quite a different approach, doesn't it?
MR. McDERMOTT:

Yes, but only in the context of

a freely negotiated -QUESTION:

Well, a much more tolerant approach

16

to arbitration clauses, and a less distrust of foreign

17

forum and foreign laws.

18

MR. McDERMOTT:

Yes, provided, however, that you

19

do not have what this Court decided in Knott almost

20

100 years ago, which was an express declaration that

21

foreign law cannot be applied in a case dealing with a

22

bill of lading governed then by the Harter/Act.

was it relieving or lessening?

1

Today in COGSA it's relieving or lessening.
All of the courts of appeals which have

2

3

addressed the analogous provision, which is a foreign

4

jurisdiction clause, which inevitably is tied to a foreign

5

law clause, have concluded that it is a prohibited

6

lessening of the carrier's liability to force the cargo

7

owner to go to a remote jurisdiction in a venue that

8

almost always is entirely unrelated to the voyage, and

9

often under color of a foreign law.

Is this venue entirely unrelated to

the voyage?

14

MR. McDERMOTT:

QUESTION:

Would your position be different if

the place for arbitration was, say, Morocco?

17
18

Yes, but the cargo was lifted in

Morocco; it was shipped and discharged in Massachusetts.

It was Japanese interests that owned and

MR. McDERMOTT:

Depending upon the law, it would

be different.

19

QUESTION:

Well, how would it be -- let's

take -- I thought your position was, any place other than

the United States is no good.
MR. McDERMOTT:

That is correct./ That is our

position.
QUESTION:

So, then why are you responding

differently to Morocco versus Tokyo, or, say, Spain, where

MR. McDERMOTT:

Well, I didn't intend to respond

3

differently.

4

which is outside the United States is invalid under COGSA,

5

because it imposes burdens, it imposes hardships, and it

6

creates unacceptable risks that the law which will be

applied will not be the controlling United States law.

3

The petitioners' position is, any forum

QUESTION:

Assuming that lessening can mean

something other than the application of a rule which

10

imposes a lower standard of liability, assuming that in

11

your favor, isn't there something a little bit antique

12

about the argument that by having to go to Tokyo or

13

Morocco or what-not, the injured party is being dragged

14

around the world?

15

going to be exactly like this?

16

I mean, isn't virtually every situation

It isn't the injured party.

Bacchus isn't

17

running around the world, a marine insurer is, and I

18

assume you, as a marine insurer, have some sense of your

19

exposure to appear in various forums of arbitration around

20

the world, so isn't there something a little bit outdated

21

about the argument that liability in fact is being

22

lessened by having to go to Tokyo or Morocco?

23

MR. McDERMOTT:

We don't believe so, because the

24

burdens of going half-way around the world, dragging your

25

witnesses half-way around the world, are very formidable

It would be just as tough for you to

go there as it would be to go to Lisbon.

MR. McDERMOTT:

No, we don't -- arbitration in

aren't they two different arguments, and the reason that

That is true, but what is also

equally provincial, if not more so, what is equally

the problem we have here of a provision which would change

the law that applies, and which would remove all

guarantees that the COGSA, which is the American enactment

that requires it be applied to this bill of lading, be

enforced.

If you go -- if a Japanese carrier, as in this

removes all guarantees, apart from the additional

QUESTION:

Well, you said that -- you had a

least purports to be modeled on the Hague Rules just like

Was there a witness on the other side

MR. McDERMOTT:

The Japanese lawyer whose

affidavit is in the record simply said that the Japanese

Hague Rules would be applied to the arbitration.

9

It is our position, when you compare the

20

Japanese Hague Rules as a matter of substantive law, to

21

COGSA, when you focus on section 3(2), which is the

22

provision which pertains to the vessel owner's obligation

23

to load and stow the cargo, there is a manifest difference

24

between the two, and there would be a lessening of the

substantive liability under the Japanese Hague Rules.s

MR. McDERMOTT:

But no finding was made to that

No, absolutely not.

The merits

were never addressed in the courts below.
QUESTION:

5

What is your response to the point

6

made in footnote 25 of the respondents' brief, which says

7

the COGSA contains the same kind of an exemption, namely

8

it says that neither the carrier nor the ship shall be

9

responsible for loss or damage arising or resulting from

10

(i) act or omission of the shipper or owner of the goods,

11

his agent or representative.
Why wouldn't that cover the exact situation

12

13

here?

14

MR. McDERMOTT:

That deals with the interplay of

15

sections 3 and 4 of COGSA and the Hague Rules.

The

16

authorities that were cited demonstrate in the United

17

States the carrier has the nondelegable obligation to load

18

and stow the cargo even if that cargo is loaded and

19

stowed, as in this case, by stevedores hired by the

20

shipper.
In other words, the carrier simply can't

21
22

delegate entirely to the shipper, or to the stevedores

23

hired by the shipper, the responsibility for the safety of

24

the cargo.

25

In contrast, the Japanese Hague Rules impose the

by him, which would exclude the stevedores in this case

hired by the shipper, so the construction of Article 3,

Friendly mentioned in Indussa, in order to determine if,

lessening of liability, because it removes the glue from

what is otherwise a bona fide claim assertable here in the

United States, and what the First Circuit did not do on

16

the merits, if you conclude that in fact a bill of lading

17

clause providing for foreign jurisdiction is invalid under

18

COGSA, is a lessening of liability, it did not seek to

19

reconcile the two statutes.

20

In particular, it did not determine whether or

21

not COGSA, which is a Federal law, would have been a basis

22

under the savings clause in section 2 of the FAA for

23

finding that the bill of lading clause was revocable, and

two statutes were irreconcilably in conflict and then just

pick one over the other, in this case the FAA.

4

If -- if a bill of lading clause is invalid

5

under COGSA, if it's a prohibited lessening of liability

6

under section 3(8), it is then revocable at law within the

7

meaning of the savings clause of section 2.
Furthermore, apart from the literal terms of the

savings clause, which makes these two statutes textually

10

reconcilable, the policies which have animated this Court

in its decisions on the Federal Arbitration Act don't come

into play in this case, because there is no meaningful

4

MR. McDERMOTT:

We're not suggesting that the

5

FAA is entirely displaced because there was not notice and

6

opportunity to negotiate.

7

The FAA in sections 1 and 2 applied to bills of

8

lading, but in terms of demonstrating whether or not a

9

particular bill of lading clause should be enforceable, as

10

the Court held in Mitsubishi, the Court has to look not to

11

the policies behind the FAA, but rather to the policies

12

behind the other statute.

13

And the other statute in this case is COGSA, and

14

it's the congressional intentions in the other competing

15

statutes which determine whether or not a bill of lading

16

clause should be enforced, and the purpose of COGSA is to

17

invalidate adhesionary clauses that override bill of

18

lading rights, and if those bill of lading rights have not

19

been negotiated, then there is no reason for COGSA not to

apply in full force, and that is petitioner's position.

I don't believe so.

I believe

7

they assumed that the two were irreconcilably in conflict,

8

and therefore they applied maxims of construction to

choose one or the other.

They went on to -- the first

10

record went on to say that it was the less specific

think is wrong - -

With the proviso of footnote 5,

MR. McDERMOTT:

1

Might, certainly, but what the

2

First Circuit was clearly recognizing was that it was only

3

the FAA which salvaged this foreign arbitration clause,

4

and that conflict between the two statutes was, we think,

resolved incorrectly, because COGSA is clearly the more

specific statute.

indispensable to the international sales of goods.
The FAA applies virtually to every maritime

It pertains to bills of lading that are

In contrast, Congress enacted COGSA for the

11

specific purposes of regulating the rights of parties to

bills of lading, and COGSA was also not, as the First

3

Circuit found, the earliest statute, which was superseded

by the enactment of the FAA as positive law of

whether there was an implied repeal of COGSA, and clearly,

(800) FOR DEPO

It wasn't

1

raised below, and for that reason we don't think the issue

2

is before the Court, but the 1970 convention has a savings

3

clause just like chapter 1 of the FAA does in section 2.

4

It specifically says, in article 3(2), that if

5

an arbitration agreement is null and void, then it need

6

not be enforced, and an arbitration clause rendered null

7

and void by COGSA would not be enforceable even under the

8

convention as enacted in 1970.

9

QUESTION:

Do you think that that means that an

10

arbitration clause that is null and void under a rule

11

prohibiting arbitration is unaffected by the FAA?

12

would sort of make the FAA useless.

13

MR. McDERMOTT:

That

Well, the COGSA is not a statute

14

that is targeted at arbitration.

15

that is targeted at clauses that reduce a carrier's

was to elevate an arbitration clause above any other

What Congress said in 1925, when it enacted the

We do not contend that that

lessening of liability would be so extreme as to validate

the clause.

arbitration per se is contrary to COGSA, nor do we contend

that COGSA claims can't be arbitrated.

We believe those are relevant factors, and that

the bill of lading which was used here, a negotiable bill

What is left of COGSA, then?

If you

Where do you get to the point of fundamental

MR. WALSH:

fundamental unfairness in the sense of geography, in the

sense of foreign law statutes -- for example, if you

assume there was a country where we were sending someone

to arbitrate and the law in that country provided that

Mr. Walsh, I have some difficulty,

Well then, under the Federal

the arbitrability of maritime contracts, the last clause

says that you cannot arbitrate -- that you must arbitrate

we try to avoid conflict, not to make conflict, and the

First Circuit seemed to be going down the line that

there's nothing inconsistent about this bill of lading

shouldn't we first see if there really is any conflict

Justice Kennedy's concern that the COGSA says, in so many

My belief is that there's nothing in
