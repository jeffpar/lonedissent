ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

GENERAL DAYS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In this case, the court of appeals has taken the

12

extraordinary step of invalidating an act of Congress as

13

being beyond its power under the Commerce Clause.

14

in question, known as the Gun-Free School Zones Act of

15

1990, makes it unlawful for any individual knowingly to

16

possess a firearm within a distance of 1,000 feet from the

17

grounds of an elementary or secondary school.

18

The act

The court of appeals held the statute

19

unconstitutional because neither the statute nor its

20

legislative history contained express congressional

21

findings identifying the nexus between interstate commerce

22

and gun possession in schoolyards.

23

The court of appeals reached its erroneous

24

result, in our estimation, through a fundamental

25

misreading and misapplication of the precedents of this

1

Court.

First, the court imposed on Congress a requirement

2

that it make judicial -- make legislative findings as to

3

the nexus between the activity it was regulating here and

4

interstate commerce to satisfy the court that it .was

5

exercising that power in a constitutional manner.

6

In doing so, the court of appeals essentially

7

treated Congress as though it was subject to procedural

8

rules that would be appropriate in the context of a

9

judicial or administrative proceeding, but not where

10

Congress was legislating for the entire Nation pursuant to

11

its plenary powers under the Constitution.

12

QUESTION:

Well, if we were concerned that the

13

original understandings and structural theories that

14

underlay the Federal system have been so eroded that that

15

whole system is in danger, I take it that it would be

16

appropriate for us to consider some procedural guarantees.

17

GENERAL DAYS:

Yes, and this Court has

18

considered and imposed certain procedural guarantees

19

where, for example, it felt that Congress was legislating

20

in a way that encroached upon the operations of State

21

governments, as in the case of New York v. United States,

22

where this Court held that Congress could not legislate to

23

the extent it did to require that the States take title to

24

certain nuclear waste.

25

It's done so under what has been referred to in

1

the court of appeals decision as the clear statement rule,

2

or the plain statement rule, that where there are

3

incursions upon Government operations, that Congress has

4

to make its intent to exercise its authority to the

5

fullest extent clear in the legislation, and there cannot

6

be any ambiguity in that respect.

7

But what this Court has been doing is looking

8

at, as it properly should, limitations on the exercise of

9

the Commerce Clause found within the Constitution itself,

10

and not based upon some generalized concern that Congress

11

was going too far in carrying out that responsibility.

12

QUESTION:

Well, let's do exactly that, and ask

13

whether the simple possession of something at or near a

14

school is commerce at all.

15

GENERAL DAYS:

Is it?

I think the answer to that is

16

that it is, yes, Your Honor.

17

QUESTION:

I would have thought that it wasn't,

18

and I would have thought that it, moreover, is not

19

interstate.

that question in a number of other circumstances, and

2

rather than starting from the assumption that something

3

was inherently local, it's looked at the degree to which

Congress had a reasonable basis for extending its

QUESTION:

But in some of those very cases,

General Days, the statement is found that the power is not

GENERAL DAYS:

13

are that are imposed by the Constitution itself.

QUESTION:

That's an understanding from the

Well, what would be -- if this case

15

is -- Congress can reach under the interstate commerce

16

power, what would be an example of a case which you

17

couldn't reach?

18

GENERAL DAYS:

Well, Your Honor, I'm not

19

prepared to speculate generally, but this Court has found

20

that Congress, for example, in New York v. United States

21

could not regulate -- could not require New York State to

22

carry out certain responsibilities, because it was

23

commandeering the instrumentalities of the State.

24

QUESTION:

was objecting the State governmental machinery to operate

The question here, it seems to me, is

quite different.

The question here is the universe of

GENERAL DAYS:

5

QUESTION:

Yes.

Can you tell me, Mr. Days, has there

6

been anything in our recent history in the last 20 years

7

where it appears that Congress made a considered judgment

8

that it could not reach a particular subject?
(Laughter.)

9

GENERAL DAYS:

10

I don't know whether there's been

11

a conscious effort to do that, but I think as this Court

12

has said in its Tenth Amendment jurisprudence that

13

Congress reflects the will of the people, and it has built

14

into it, and into its operations, a concern about the

15

extent to which its regulations and its legislation would

16

encroach on matters that have been traditionally left to

17

the State.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Days, we have really not been

19

too -- what should I say, too strict about, you know, what

20

the farthest reach of the Commerce Clause may be.

21

But as I read our cases, the ones that are most

22

often cited, indeed, I think all of them, involve the

23

issue of whether some commercial activity of some sort --

24

renting a hotel room, growing a commodity that is used in

25

commerce -- whether some commercial activity is interstate

commerce or not, and one can say we're prepared to be very

2

broadminded about that.

3

activity is interstate commerce, or affects interstate

4

commerce, that's okay.

5

If Congress says some commercial

But here you have regulation of something that

6

is not commercial activity in any sense of the word,

7

merely the possession of an item.

8

GENERAL DAYS:

9

QUESTION:

Your Honor, two --

Might we not apply a different rule

10

in that case than we do -- I mean, give up the whole realm

11

of commerce to the Federal Government.

12

relates to commerce, the Federal Government can control,

13

securities regulation, all sorts of things.

GENERAL DAYS:

QUESTION:

Say, anything that

Well, I have two --

But it has to relate to commerce.

This doesn't relate to commerce, even.
GENERAL DAYS:

I have two responses.

One, this

18

Court did decide, in a case called Preseault v. ICC, that

19

Congress could use its commerce powers to convert rights

20

of ways to recreational uses for hiking trails, and there

21

was no indication that that particular objective by

22

Congress was a commercial objective.

23

But I think we have to keep in mind that the

24

Commerce Clause -- the Commerce Clause has been viewed as

25

dealing with three areas, the channels of commerce itself,

fact for many of the past couple of decades, what this

Court has found is that activities that affect commerce

What cases do you have that involve that?

GENERAL DAYS:

QUESTION:

9

Well, it's not --

Noncommercial activities that affect

commerce.
GENERAL DAYS:

10

If one looks, Justice Scalia, for

11

example, at the regulation of firearms, certainly Congress

12

was concerned about the degree to which transfer or

13

possession in some instances affected interstate commerce,

14

but I think it also recognized that having a gun in and of

15

itself is not interstate commerce, it's the impact of

16

certain activity on interstate commerce.

17

For example, the rules that limit the types of

18

persons who can possess firearms, it's not suggesting that

19

that particular regulation --

commercial activity?

3

What cases --

GENERAL DAYS:

I don't believe that the issue

4

has been clearly presented, Justice Scalia, but I think

5

that what this Court has operated upon as an initial

6

assumption is that Congress was given the power under the

7

Constitution to legislate directly upon private

8

individuals, and that there are no built-in limitations on
the Constitution.

10

QUESTION:

General Days, just to understand what

11

we're talking about, do I correctly understand your

12

position to be, your rationale for this --

13

GENERAL DAYS:

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- that all violent crime, if

15

Congress so desired, could be placed under a Federal wing,

16

could be placed in the Federal court for prosecution, all

violent crime, or is there any stopping point?

GENERAL DAYS:

21

the answer is that it may be possible for Congress to do

22

that under the commerce power.

rational basis for thinking that regulating violence would

have an impact on interstate commerce, would have -- would

But what we have in this particular act is not

1

thought process expressed in the amendment, that the

2

States, for whatever reason, violence, or whatever reason,

3

had simply proven incapable of providing sufficient

4

education in math and technology, that in the long run was

5

a threat to commercial activity, and as a response to

6

that, Congress was, in fact, going to nationalize the

7

schools, and it in effect would provide a Federal public

8

school education for every child from kindergarten on up?

9

Would that be justifiable under the Commerce Clause?

10

GENERAL DAYS:

Well, that's certainly one of the

11

concerns that's been expressed, but I think that this

12

Court has readily available to it a way of analyzing that,

13

and that in reading New York v. United States, one would

14

have to be concerned whether this particular activity was

imposing statutory requirements on the State, or --

That's correct.

Congress is dealing with the conduct of individuals --

be permitted to do that, allowed to do that under the

Constitution.

QUESTION:

General Days, if Congress proscribes

unless you're -- are you saying that violence as a whole

2

will be cut down and therefore people will feel freer to

3

travel in interstate commerce?
GENERAL DAYS:

4

Yes, I think that's a reasonable

5

assumption to think that Congress could have held or

6

relied upon in enacting this statute.
QUESTION:

7
8

That possession of a gun in a

schoolyard contributes to that sort of violence?
GENERAL DAYS:

9

Well, I think, Chief Justice

10

Rehnquist, that it is an easy step from possession to use

11

and, therefore, the fact that Congress might be concerned

12

with possession doesn't mean that it wasn't concerned

13

about use.

14

And there also is sufficient evidence in the

15

consideration of even the Gun-Free School Zones Act that

16

there was heightened violence on school property by

17

juveniles, and if one looks at the findings and records

18

with respect to earlier legislation -- for example, the

19

Omnibus- Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 --

20

Congress makes specific findings between the easy

21

availability of firearms and the level of juvenile and

22

youthful violence and criminality.

23

So that the connection between possession of

24

firearms on or near schoolyards and violence and the

25

regulation of that possession are relationships that

Congress has considered in the past, and in our estimation

made perfectly good sense under the Gun-Free School Zones

Act.

QUESTION:

General Days, I think it's well-

established that a factor in both the education of

children and in the law-abiding nature of children, a

major factor is the stability of families.

8

under your reasoning, Congress could enact a Federal

domestic relations law providing a Federal marriage,

Federal divorce procedures, and what-not.

nothing that affects levels of crime and levels of

education as much as that.

I think that, based

upon its interstate commerce power, it could determine

that what the State had done interfered with the free flow

therefore had to be dealt with, but getting back to --

QUESTION:

The only limitation, then, that

you're recognizing, is the narrow reading -- well, strike

narrow, is a reading of U.S. v. New York that Congress

could not impose certain affirmative obligations upon the

even displacement of State regulation, presumably there is

seems to me you're saying that the only instance in which

we can clearly say that the delicate balance would be

destroyed is the instance in which the national Government

Well,

think this Court has indicated that Congress could not go,

5

that the Federal balance is remitted to the political

judgment of the Congress.

7

GENERAL DAYS:

Well, I think, Your Honor, in

8

Garcia what this Court indicated was that the protection

9

of this balance, insofar as the Tenth Amendment is

10

concerned, really does reside with the political process

11

and in Congress.
QUESTION:

12

13

I think that's the necessary

consequence of the argument that you're making here.

GENERAL DAYS:

It's not an argument that I

concocted, Justice Kennedy.

from this Court's decisions, and that one does -- as I

indicated to Justice O'Connor, one doesn't start the

analysis by saying there are things that are clearly local

There are the --

QUESTION:

Well, but there ought to be limits

These are powers

expressly delegated to the Congress under a constitutional

scheme that envisions that Congress has certain enumerated

QUESTION:

Yes.

What relevance do you think those

findings have to our problem today?
GENERAL DAYS:

Justice Stevens, we're not

5

relying on them in the strict sense of the word, but we

6

think that at a very minimum they indicate that reasons

7

can be identified for why Congress wanted to regulate this

8

particular activity, so that it's corroborative of what we

9

were saying our briefs, and what we think this Court

10

should properly find about the bases that Congress relied

11

upon in legislating it as it did, or could rely upon.

12

QUESTION:

Do you think the court of appeals

13

would have decided the case the same way if those findings

14

had been in the original statute?

15

GENERAL DAYS:

I do not believe that the court

16

of appeals, based upon just the reading of the decision,

17

would have come out the same way, but I can't be

18

absolutely certain.

19

What the Court did was impose a number of

20

procedural requirements on Congress, and I'm not certain

how it would view these particular findings, whether they

had been promulgated in a way that touched every base that

the court of appeals felt was necessary.

MR. CARTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
When the American people established the

7

national Government, if they had then invested it with a

8

general police power, there'd be little problem with laws

9

like the Gun-Free School Zones Act.

State legislators

10

possess general police powers, and they pass laws like

11

this all the time.

12

QUESTION:

I am aware of at least two schools

13

within 1,000 feet of an interstate highway.

14

there are many schools in the United States that are

15

within 1,000 feet of an interstate highway, or of a

16

heavily traveled artery.

17

MR. CARTER:

18

QUESTION:

I am sure

Don't you think that's correct?

Yes, sir.
Well, if a State tried to pass this

identical statute, would that not be, then, an

20

interference with interstate commerce beyond the authority

21

of the States to enact?

were, in fact interfering with interstate commerce.

The Court, however, did not

Believe me, I wish it had, because I think

you're absolutely correct that when Congress reaches to

regulate intrastate, noncommercial activity without some

expanded into this area talked about a close and

substantial connection, and somehow along the way that

It makes precisely the same findings.

If the kids smoke marijuana, they'll be poor students, and
education will suffer, and the economy will suffer.
MR. CARTER:

I think the prohibition on that

basis would have to be limited to students.
