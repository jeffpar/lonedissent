ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. ALLEN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. ALLEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case is whether State courts

11
12

may refuse to enforce remedies under two Federal statutes,

13

sections 1983 and 1988 of title 42, in cases challenging

14

State taxes when State courts and State procedures provide

15

an adequate remedy for the underlying claim.

16

The Oklahoma supreme court in this case held

17

that State courts may refuse to enforce remedies under

18

sections 1983 and 1988 in such cases.

19

conclusion entirely on what it termed principles of comity

20

in federalism, which it perceived to be embodied in the

21

Federal Tax Injunction Act, which prohibits Federal courts

22

from enjoining State taxes in cases where a plain, speedy,

23

and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such

24

State.

25

It based that

The main consequence of that ruling in this case

is to deny petitioners a right to recover their attorney's

2

fees that they would otherwise have under section 1988.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Allen, there are other

4

consequences upholding that the State courts have to

5

entertain section 1983 action in State court, and I'd like

6

you to address in the course of your argument how you

7

think this would play out, if you're right, that they have

8

to entertain a 1983 action.

9

What if the State has administrative claims

10

procedures in any case involving ultimately declaration or

11

injunction of State taxes that you have to make this

12

administrative claim first?

13

MR. ALLEN:

Justice O'Connor, there may be --

14

there may well be other consequences to the conclusion

15

that section 1983 applies.

16

presented in this case or really properly - -

17

QUESTION:

None of those questions are

I know.

I'm asking you, though, what

18

you think about a State's administrative claims procedure,

19

if you're right.

20

MR. ALLEN:

If a State has a procedure requiring

21

exhaustion of administrative remedies in a tax case,

22

which, by the way, Oklahoma does not, but if it did, this

23

Court's previous decisions would indicate that in the 1983

24

action those exhaustion of administrative remedy

25

requirements are -- ordinarily cannot be enforced in the

Federal procedure.
QUESTION:

2

Well, in the tax area that can be

3

very troublesome, and there -- something else occurs to

4

me.

5

does not have to have a predeprivation remedy for tax

6

relief if there is a clear and certain and prompt

7

postdeprivation remedy.

8

10

We have said in McKesson and like cases that a State

Now, to allow the 1983 action would mean in
every instance, I guess, a plea deprivation determination.
MR. ALLEN:

Not necessarily, Justice O'Connor.

11

I don't see any reason why, in a section 1983 action -- I

12

don't see why it would be implied in a 1983 action that

13

you necessarily had a predeprivation remedy.

14

QUESTION:

Well, you're coming in claiming the

15

right to declaratory and/or injunctive relief -- State,

16

you can't get these taxes.

17

think, of a predeprivation remedy.

18
19
20

MR. ALLEN:

Now, that is in the nature, I

Well, let me simply repeat that

that's not an issue in this case.
I think that the probable outcome, if that was -

21

- if the issue was squarely presented, the logic would

22

probably be that a person who filed a 1983 action

23

challenging a State tax in State court before he paid the

24

tax, and if the State court made a final adjudication that

25

the State tax was unconstitutional, I do believe that

1

section 1983 would entitle the taxpayer in that

2

circumstance to injunctive or declaratory relief which

3

would in effect preclude the State from --

4

QUESTION:

And that's -- you know, that's

5

precisely what this Court has been careful to say the

6

States don't have to do, that they can at least require

7

people to pay their taxes and litigate later and follow

8

certain claims procedures in doing so - -

9
10

MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:

Well --- and I think you have a strong

11

argument, but it does seem to me that if you're right, and

12

if no adjustments are appropriate here, that it would have

13

a rather dramatic effect on established law in this area.

14

MR. ALLEN:

Well, you raise a very pertinent

15

question, but I think we have to be very careful here,

16

because the point you just made was that the Court has

17

been careful to preserve the right of States to - - or at

18

least the constitutional right of States, putting apart

19

the requirements of any Federal statute, the

20

constitutional rights of States to require people to pay

21

their taxes before they litigate the ultimate question.

22

But what I am saying is that in my view, under

23

section 1983, if you filed an action and there was a

24

litigation that finally determined that the tax was

25

unconstitutional -- in other words, you had done your

MR. ALLEN:

QUESTION:

7

Well, you file 1983, you get a

you are.

Well, there's -That's the way it works, and there

There the State is, can't collect the tax.
MR. ALLEN:

There's a very important

8

distinction, I think, for these purposes, between a

9

preliminary injunction and a permanent injunction.

10

The point I was making earlier was that when you

11

have filed your action and it's come to a final judgment

12

in the trial court, and the final judgment is that the

13

State is -- that the tax is unconstitutional, I believe

14

that under 1983 you would be entitled to a permanent

15

injunction against the collection of the tax.

16

QUESTION:

What if a State had a requirement

17

just like the Federal Government does now that there

18

simply shall not be injunctions issued enjoining the

19

collection of a tax.

20

MR. ALLEN:

I think in those cases, Mr. Chief

21

Justice, the State scheme has to yield to the Federal

22

remedy, and I think --

23

QUESTION:

So the Federal remedy requires the

24

States to do something that Congress has said the Federal

25

Government can't be required to do.

MR. ALLEN:

1

2

I think that's correct, Your Honor,

but let me return to -QUESTION:

3

Then what sense does that make in

4

terms of the Tax Injunction Act?

You said the concern is

5

you don't want the Federal courts to be telling the

6

States.

7

but you've got to do it.

8

you can't have your own constitutional --

Isn't it so much worse to be telling the States,

MR. ALLEN:

9

You've got to be the one to say

Well, I think that's right, Justice

10

Ginsburg.

11

Federal scheme under section 1983 gives taxpayers, State

12

taxpayers a right to equitable relief when a State tax is

13

unconstitutional.

14

poll tax, which this Court has held to be -- to violate

15

the Equal Protection Clause.

16

Let me give you an example.

I think that the

A good example would be, in my view, a

If a State had a poll tax that required poor

17

people to pay $20 before they could vote, if a State also

18

had a statute that said, but you've got to pay your tax

19

before you can litigate the validity of it, I submit to

20

you that the taxpayer in that situation would have a

21

right, under section 1983, to an injunction enjoining the

22

enforcement of that poll tax, because --

1

postdeprivation remedies at law could be a principle that

2

would enable the State court to say, we will deny

3

equitable relief, because there's a plain, speedy remedy

4

at law here, no equitable relief.
MR. ALLEN:

5
6

How would that work?

Well, I'm not sure I understand the

question, if --

7

QUESTION:

Well, if the remedy sought in the

8

State court is essentially an equitable one, would it not

9

be open to the State court to deny an injunction or

10

declaratory relief on the grounds that we have in this

11

State a plain, a speedy, an adequate remedy at law?
MR. ALLEN:

12

I don't believe so, Your Honor, not

13

under section 1983.

To return to my poll tax example, I

14

don't think in that example the State court could say, the

15

man can sue and get a refund of his poll tax after he

litigates the validity of --

mean, there's no economic equivalence there, whereas in

2

the trucking case there is.
MR. ALLEN:

3

Well, the question was, I believe

4

the question was it is open to a State court who has

5

determined that a tax is unconstitutional, is it open to

6

that State court to say, you've still got to pay it and

then go for your refund later, and I submit that under the

8

scheme of section 1983 that's simply not open to the State

court.

QUESTION:

Well, except that I suppose that

11

isn't what the court would do.

say, we don't enjoin.

understand and draw a careful distinction between a

20

request for preliminary injunctive relief and a request

21

for final injunctive relief.

22

Now, if we're talking about a request for

preliminary injunctive relief, then I submit that whether

you're filing under section 1983 or any other statute, the

high showing.
He has to show irreparable injury, he has to

show a strong likelihood of success on the merits, and all

4

the rest of it, and I have no dispute with the proposition

5

that when you're requesting preliminary relief before

6

there's been an adjudication of the merits the courts can

7

properly deny it if you haven't met those high standards,

8

and in fact in this very case, we sought preliminary

injunctive relief, and the trial judge --

QUESTION:

Yes, but that doesn't go -- it seems

to me -- I agree with you, but that doesn't go to the

point of the hypothetical.

is, if you have an adequate remedy of law after the fact,

you, the petitioner for the relief, are not entitled to a

prepayment adjudication.

MR. ALLEN:

The point of the hypothetical

may not be entitled to preliminary relief, and I wouldn't

MR. ALLEN:

QUESTION:

MR. ALLEN:

QUESTION:

No.
And so you -My answer is no.
You agree that if, in fact, there is

a postdeprivation remedy, even if the court is required to

10

entertain at least some claim for relief under 1983, it

11

would not have to provide a predeprivation remedy?
MR. ALLEN:

12

13

It would not have to provide a

preliminary injunctive -- injunction.

14

QUESTION:

Well, it wouldn't have to provide a

15

remedy to your petitioner before your petitioner paid the

tax.

17

Do you agree?
MR. ALLEN:

I agree with part of that question,

18

but let me try to explain my answer.

19

wouldn't be entitled to preliminary injunctive relief, but

20

if we're at the stage where there's been a full

21

adjudication and the Court has decided this tax is

22

unconstitutional, obviously unconstitutional, as the

23

supreme court of Oklahoma said here, then I submit that

the petitioner would be entitled to injunctive relief --

the Court said the tax is unconstitutional.
MR. ALLEN:

2

He may not need it, and therefore

3

we're really arguing about something that has no

significant impact on the States, but I submit to you that

5

if the tax collector nevertheless threatened a levy on his

property, that he would be entitled under --

But how could he - - how could --

Excuse me.
QUESTION:

10

I'm sorry.
Mr. Allen, you just said the State

court has said this tax is unconstitutional, and once the

12

State court said that, how can any State tax collector go

13

out and levy on the property?

14

MR. ALLEN:

15

Most of them won't, but sometimes

they will.

16

The point is that injunctive relief is, in those

situations where the tax collector would threaten to levy

Under a preliminary -- under a

States can say, as a blanket matter, when you're

challenging a State tax as unconstitutional, as a blanket

9

matter we're not going to issue preliminary injunctions.

10

I think that they can impose on litigants the

normal standards of preliminary injunctions, but I don't

think they can erect a special standard that would apply

QUESTION:

Well, as an adequate -- I suppose you

can look at an adequate remedy of law as being a base that

has to be touched, and if there is an adequate remedy of

But it's dictum in the case, and the

with respect to Eleventh Amendment law, but this is a

statute, it's not the Eleventh Amendment, and it's

certainly open to us to interpret the statute simply not

to allow a 1983 suit against an officer acting in his

MR. JOHNSTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I think a very important question that is before

24

to impose on State courts the obligation to apply Federal

25

remedies under 1983 or 1988 or otherwise in State tax

challenges when a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy is

2

available and may be had under State law?

3

Congress had no such intention and did not accomplish that

4

with 1983.

5

I submit that

The nature of this case is more than just an

6

injunction.

The lawsuit was brought under the State

7

statute that provided that anyone who wishes to challenge

8

the constitutionality of a tax statute or the -- or its

9

violation under a Federal statute must give notice after

10

it has been assessed or proposed to be assessed, must give

11

notice, pay the tax under protest, and then may file a

12

lawsuit in district court, the State's trial court, for

13

its recovery.

14

Now, the statute, of course, does not provide

15

for injunction.

16

have any specific statute prohibiting enjoining a State

17

tax, although Oklahoma case law has on several occasions

18

prohibited it.

19

Oklahoma does not, as do some States,

Declaratory relief has been allowed under

20

Oklahoma case law against a tax if the tax is not yet due.

21

Once the tax is due and proposed to be assessed, however,

22

the Oklahoma statutes provide basically two remedies.

23

is the administrative hearing remedy, which also can be

24

used at the taxpayer's option to challenge a proposed

25

assessment on any grounds, including grounds of

One

constitu -- State or constitutional questions or violation

2

of Federal law.
In addition to that remedy -- by the way, in the

3
4

administrative hearing procedure the hearing was held

5

before the tax commission as an agency, and its order is

6

directly the appealable to the Oklahoma supreme court.

7

As an alternative, and this is what was used in

8

this case, Oklahoma law provides that instead of filing an

9

administrative protest, that the taxpayer can pay the

10

taxes under protest, file suit in district court for the

11

recovery.

12

However - QUESTION:

13
14

That is what has happened in this case.

So here the taxpayer did comply with

Oklahoma procedures, or at least in that respect.

15

MR. JOHNSTON:

That is true, and for the access

16

to the courts under this, and this is title 68, section

17

226 of the Oklahoma statutes, under the action 226 which

18

this was brought, there is no need, other than giving

19

notice of intent and paying the taxes under protest within

20

30 days, that is the only exhaustion requirement that is

21

necessary, that the Oklahoma courts have declared

22

necessary.

State law does not provide for attorney's fees.
QUESTION:

2

But you're looking at it from the

3

point of view, as everyone is, of tax law, but forgetting

4

tax law for the moment, isn't it normal that the 1983

5

remedy is treated as, if State law gives a plaintiff all

6

the remedies that 1983 gives them but attorney's fees,

7

still they recover attorney's fees under 1983?
Isn't that the normal rule, because you could

8

9

have two causes of action get you to the same result, but

10

Congress wanted to give these civil rights plaintiffs

11

attorney's fees.

12

should you make an exception here?

13

And then the question becomes, well, why

MR. JOHNSTON:

I certainly can't - - as I - - I

14

will accept that because my expertise, if any there is

15

with 1983, certainly doesn't go much beyond the tax area,

16

but I accept that as a basic statement, but I believe that

17

the difference is, and why not in this case, is because

18

when Congress enacted 1983 and then they were aware, for

19

instance, that in the tax area it was common that the only

20

right that anyone had to challenge a State tax was in the

21

nature of an action in, was to pay it and sue to recover

22

it.

23

More importantly, when the attorney's fee

24

provision was enacted, Congress had already, in 1937, I

25

believe, had already provided that -- their restrictions

against the Federal courts from interfering in State tax

2

matters.

3

QUESTION:

Well, that, it seemed to me, which is

4

a very strong argument, would argue for an exception to

5

the no exhaustion principle.

6

exhaustion principle is read into

7

decision in Patsy v. Regents, and there were strong policy

8

reasons for doing that, and reading that, and you have

9

very strong policy reasons as to not to interfere.

You see, that's -- the no
983-88 via this Court's

But don't -- I mean, maybe the -- I'm not

10
11

suggesting this is a conclusion.

The policy reasons might

12

read out the no exhaustion, and if they read out the no

3

exhaustion, then the main policy objection to applying it

4

is gone but for attorney's fees, and yet we have a basic

5

congressional decision that you get your attorney's fees

6

when something violates the Civil Rights Act as well as

7

violating State law.

8

That's what I'd appreciate a reaction to.

9

MR. JOHNSTON:

I think that the -- probably the

20

answer to that is, if we take that approach, and you say

21

well, we will --we could extend

22

State tax matters, but we'll change our interpretation so

23

that there's no -- that you can have an exhaustion

24

remedy.

1

then going back and disregarding what the purpose of 1983

2

was, and whether or not it was ever intended to apply in

3

such cases in the first place.

4

QUESTION:

Well, is there some reason it wasn't

5

intended to apply in - - for violations of the Commerce

6

Clause, whereas it was intended to apply for violations of

7

the Fourteenth Amendment?
In other words, the thing that's worrying me

8

9

about this entire case is the -- not this area, but what

10

the impact is on some other area, and whether it's

11

possible to create an exception here, and why would you?
MR. JOHNSTON:

12

If I understand the concern, I

13

don't think that what we're talking about is creating an

14

exception here, but recognizing that it never did apply in

15

the first place.

16

Because I believe that Congress, when it enacted

17

the Tax Injunction Act clearly expressed an attitude and a

18

policy of Federal noninterference and nonintrusion in the

19

State tax area with one requirement, of course, that there

20

be a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy available.
QUESTION:

2

it have been pointless if it had not assumed that?
MR. JOHNSTON:

I think not, Your Honor, because

3

in the times when the Tax Injunction Act was enacted, as I

4

understand historically you had usually the situation

5

where interstate businesses or taxpayers were challenging

6

State tax laws, not on the basis of

7

seeking injunctions pending the litigation and often

8

causing the States, because of their ability and the

9

taxpayer's ability to either have to give up the case or

983, but usually

10

to accept something less than what was owed, or else have

11

their entire collecting mechanism, at least to that

12

extent, disrupted during the litigation, and Congress

3

perceived that as an evil, and I don't recall that

4

remedies were involved in that, but they, in proceeding --

Well, as I understand the

historical basis of

QUESTION:

Because of the way it's written.

MR. JOHNSTON:

Because of the way it's written

4

and the continuing situations that come before the courts,

5

but I submit that it was never intended -- and although it

6

is very, very broadly worded, it is so broadly worded as

7

to cover probably situations that I can't conceive of

8

today, but I do not believe that considering the history

9

and the knowledge, presumed knowledge of Congress when

10

both 1983, the Ku Klux Act, was passed and also when

11

the -- years later when 1988 was added to it, I do not

believe Congress ever supposed or intended, nor do I

believe the wording goes or requires this Court to apply

those remedies, the Federal remedies in State tax actions.

MR. JOHNSTON:

-- that the State would have been

justified in accepting, as the court below did, yes, we

are now told, and we understand that the Commerce Clause

12

will provide a basis for

However, the State law provides a full remedy,

4

federalism and comity, considering the policy of Congress,

in not entertaining that, because I don't believe -- this

the question that we have here today.

States to give the Federal remedies?
Well, where do you stop?

2

Do you have to start

3

creating specific exceptions, or grants, or so forth,

4

because, for instance, although under an action in - -

5

under Oklahoma statute 226, the suit for recovery,

6

exhaustion of the administrative remedies are not

7

required, I believe other States do have those

8

requirements, that before you can go to court, you have to
have -- follow certain administrative processes.

10

Generally speaking, under 1 83 those are not -- had not

11

been required by the court.
Statutes of limitations, for instance.

12

13

Generally, the statute of limitations under 1 83 has been

14

held to be the general tort statute under the State.

15

However, States typically have much, much shorter statutes

16

of limitations notice requirements, notice of claim

17

requirements for tax challenges.
Now, all of these requirements that the States

18
1

typically have, have of course been approved by the court,

20

and have been observed to be constitutional and allowable

21

and also very necessary to the State's interest in

MR. JOHNSTON:

A State is not a person, and

therefore I believe an action for damages in the nature of

And then once I get to the policies underlying

State taxes, and that same Congress who expressed the

7

policy under 1983 has also expressed a policy under 1341

8

that the Federal Government, including Federal remedies,

9

should stay out of State tax matters basically only so

10

long as there is an adequate remedy, to the contrary of

11

what 1983 started out to be.
QUESTION:

12

But that seems to undermine, at least

13

in part, the Dennis case, because isn't -- if you're right

14

about the bottom line in Dennis being no counsel fees,

15

wasn't that kind of a Pyrrhic victory?

16

MR. JOHNSTON:

I suggest that the only question

17

that was really presented in Dennis is whether or not the

18

Commerce Clause granted rights and privileges which would

19

be -- a violation of which would be protected, or a remedy

20

given under 1983, and I can envision, possibly, violations

21

by State actors of the Commerce Clause in areas that have

22

nothing to do with taxation.

QUESTION:

But that case itself happened to be a

tax case.
MR. JOHNSTON:

That case itself is certainly a

I am not aware that the question of

17

the danger to the States and their ability to plan and

administer their taxes is quite substantial, and could be

19

substantial if the Court were to open up 1983 to the point

20

that it says Congress intended that you must apply any

21

remedies that might be available under 1983 even though

22

you otherwise have adequate remedies.

the same thing.

So I would suggest that if we accept the

petitioner's argument, it is to accept the concept that

6

Congress intended to prohibit the Federal courts from

7

interfering or supplying Federal remedies in State tax

8

matters, and then at the same time, without ever saying

so, they intended to mandate that State courts apply those

Federal remedies.
