ORAL ARGUMENT OF SEAN D. O'BRIEN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. O'BRIEN:

9

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
The issues in this case involve the standard for

10
11

determining a colorable claim that the wrong person has

12

been convicted of a crime.

13

extraordinary case in which the system of justice broke

14

down and produced a fundamental miscarriage of justice.

Mr. Schlup's case is an

The facts of this case reveal the need for the

15
16

miscarriage of justice safety valve.

It is our position

17

that a standard that does not reach Mr. Schlup's case is

18

incapable of protecting the innocent.

19

facts, objective facts, in this case that both sides must

20

accept, have accepted since the beginning.

There are certain

The victim in this case, Arthur Dade, was

stabbed in the Missouri State Penitentiary in a housing

23

unit shortly after all of the prisoners were released to

three floors, and at least one security checkpoint away

2

from the scene of the crime, and a minute and 5 seconds

3

after Mr. Schlup enters the dining room, the guards are

4

seen responding to a radio distress call.

5

Now, at trial, in order to prove Mr. Schlup's

6

guilt, the State had to do two things.

7

show a substantial delay between the homicide and the

8

radio distress call, and the second thing it had to show

9

was that Mr. Schlup raced past everyone else to cut in

10

line, the head of the line for lunch, and there is now

11

strong, uncontradicted evidence that now rebuts both of

12

those propositions, and this evidence is also corroborated

13

by other direct, circumstantial, and scientific evidence

14

that Mr. Schlup was not involved in the crime.

15

QUESTION:

16

against Mr. Schlup?

17

First, it had to

What evidence was introduced at trial

MR. O'BRIEN:

The evidence at trial was two

18

identification witnesses, a officer who was the one

19

opening the cell block for lunch, and another one on the

20

uppermost tier in the housing unit.

21

direct evidence, and they both said that Mr. Schlup

22

committed the crime.

QUESTION:

1

2

They said that they had seen him stab

the person?
MR. O'BRIEN:

3

Correct.

They said that they saw

4

Mr. Schlup hold the victim while another inmate, Robert

5

O'Neal, stabbed him in the chest, and we have eye

6

witnesses to the crime who say that that person was Randy

7

Jordan who held the victim, while Robert O'Neal stabbed

8

him in the chest.
QUESTION:

9

Well, wasn't there some evidence

10

that, I think it was, Eberle called the guards out of the

11

cafeteria, or at least told Peoples to do that, some 10 to

12

15 minutes after the disturbance?

13

make that inference from the evidence?

14

MR. O'BRIEN:

At least, can't you

You can make that inference from

15

the evidence, but it would be a false assumption.

16

false assumption is that Eberle was the only person who

17

could have made that call because the radio was the only

18

way out of the housing unit, and in fact there was a

19

telephone that has a speed dial number keyed in right to

20

the control center within 15 feet of where the victim

21

collapsed.

22

23
24
25

QUESTION:

The

Well, the fact that someone else

could have made the call doesn't mean that Eberle didn't.
MR. O'BRIEN:

That's true, but the question

here, Your Honor, is who made the first call?

Was

1

Eberle's call transmitted before Mr. Schlup, you know, or

2

after Mr. Schlup got into the dining room, and actually in

3

this case they built a delay into Eberle even getting into

4

the housing unit to make that call, but my point, Your

5

Honor, is there was ample evidence to show several sources

of the guards being notified that -QUESTION:

evidence at a trial, the defense introduces evidence

10

You introduce this

showing perhaps a mistake, and you submit it to a jury.
MR. O'BRIEN:

11

Your Honor, in this case there was

12

key evidence withheld from the jury that completely

13

stripped the videotape of its probative value, and that

14

was the evidence of a witness who said that he picked up

15

the telephone and called base within 30 seconds of Arthur

16

Dade hitting the ground, and if that's so, then Mr. Schlup

17

was in the dining room at the time.

jury?

MR. O'BRIEN:

QUESTION:

MR. O'BRIEN:

Your Honor --

Do you or do you not?
I would make -- I would continue

6

to make the claim because that's my role as an advocate

7

for the client, but as a practical matter, Your Honor, at

8

this point I think we have as much probative evidence of

9

Mr. Schlup's innocence as we need to meet the standard

that this Court - QUESTION:

Well, what is -- do you want to show

ineffective assistance of counsel?

threshold of the exception that you're arguing about?

That is one, Your Honor.

The

other is Brady v. Maryland.
QUESTION:

Well, so far as ineffective

18

assistance, that would almost put us in the position of

19

advisory, wouldn't it, because the circuit has already

20

said, we have looked at this issue and we are not going to

21

change our mind; we have found that there was effective

22

assistance of counsel.

23

MR. O'BRIEN:

Your Honor, I believe that -- to

24

me, that statement in the court below seems to be dicta,

25

because the court said in another case in its opinion that

standard.

in the district court because there was never any evidence

Circuit - -

Brady was not.

Okay.
Correct.

But it was --

17

you recognizing that the actual innocence claim is a door-

18

opener so that you must have behind it some constitutional

19

claim, the Brady claim ineffective, or are you making the

20

argument that newly discovered evidence of innocence of

21

the crime is enough, without any more, to make that a

22

constitutional violation?

23

MR. O'BRIEN:

Your Honor, in this case,

Mr. Schlup's innocence functions as a door opener to get

into court.

3

QUESTION:

Fine.

I just wanted to know what

your position is.
QUESTION:

Well, on that point, then, for a

4

successive habeas claim, normally we require the

5

petitioner to show cause and prejudice, do we not, to make

6

a successive habeas claim?

7
8

0

MR. O'BRIEN:

Normally, the Court does require

that, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

All right, and you are saying that

this is a successive claim, but shouldn't the standard
employed be something greater than the cause-and-prejudice

2

3

requirement, otherwise the two just are subsumed together?
MR. O'BRIEN:

That's correct.

We're not asking

4

the Court to do away with cause under the cause prejudice

5

test and, in fact, every time this Court refers to the

IS

cause prejudice standard, it also reserves the possibility

7

of the fundamental miscarriage of justice exception as a

8

recognition that there will be occasional cases that the

9

cause prejudice test does not reach, but --

20

QUESTION:

And as to that, it ought to be

2

something, some standard higher than merely cause and

22

prejudice, I would think.

23

MR. O'BRIEN:

That's correct, Your Honor, and

24

the standard that we are asking to apply, the standard

25

that this Court applies, is Kuhlmann v. Wilson.

We are --

1

QUESTION:

Well, that's part of the problem,

2

because the Kuhlmann standard may actually be even a

3

lesser standard than cause and prejudice.

4

not clear at all.

5

MR. O'BRIEN:

I think that's

Your Honor, I believe it's clear

6

from the Court's jurisprudence that the Kuhlmann standard

7

is greater than the cause-and-prejudice standard, and I

8

think McCleskey is a good example of that.

9

standard is really a truth-oriented standard.

The Kuhlmann
We are

10

trying to determine the equity of innocence and whether or

11

not it exists in the case.

12

The cause-and-prejudice standard is oriented to

13

the adversarial system and whether it's produced an

14

appropriate result, but McCleskey is a good example of a

15

person who could probably show prejudice had he been able

16

to show cause, but he could definitely not meet the

17

Kuhlmann standard.

18

QUESTION:

What we're trying to find out here is

19

which of two or perhaps three standards apply to this

20

door-opener, as you refer to it and as Justice Ginsburg,

21

the Kuhlmann standard, perhaps Murray v. Carrier, or

22

perhaps Sawyer, all of which have stated the thing in

23

somewhat different words.

24

MR. O'BRIEN:

Isn't that correct?

That's correct, Your Honor, except

that when the Sawyer standard stated -- when the Sawyer

8

9

In that case, the Kuhlmann standard was

The Eighth Circuit held here that the

Sawyer standard applied where the challenge was to guilt

10

as well as where the challenge is to sentence, and that's

11

the question you brought before us for review.

12

MR. O'BRIEN:

13

QUESTION:

Correct.

We should have two different

14

standards, one for guilt and one for sentence, or whether

15

Sawyer should be applied across the board.

16

MR. O'BRIEN:

That's correct, Your Honor, and I

17

believe there are two different standards because there

18

are two different situations.

19

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. O'Brien, didn't Sawyer

20

apply its standard to both guilt and penalty phase

21

challenges in that case?

22

MR. O'BRIEN:

QUESTION:

Your Honor --

At least, the court's opinion said it

did.
MR. O'BRIEN:

It did apply it to a guilt phase

1

Standard, but not an innocence argument.

2

there's a fundamental distinction, because Sawyer's

3

innocence, even if he was -- even if it was true, as the

4

Court observed, still left him guilty of a capital crime,

5

and so he was not innocent in the Sawyer sense of the

6

word.

not innocent of the crime.

He was not innocent of the death penalty, he was

I believe there's also a world of difference

between innocence where you've got the wrong person, and

That's correct, Your Honor,

Incidentally, and was your Brady

claim presented to the circuit court?
MR. O'BRIEN:

Your Honor, the Brady claim was

not presented in the district court.

The briefing in the

10

circuit court focused mainly on the procedural gateway

11

argument, and - -

12

QUESTION:

My question is, was the Brady claim

13

presented to the circuit court?

14

MR. O'BRIEN:

No, Your Honor, and I don't recall

15

if the ineffective counsel claim was presented.

16

majority opinion was responding more to the dissenting

17

opinion, and that was kind of a process of the expedited

18

nature of the proceedings.

19

Eighth Circuit under execution warrant with simultaneous

20

briefs filed, and then the major bases for the Eighth

21

Circuit's ruling on the merits, or discussion of the

22

merits, were depositions that were filed at oral argument

just a few days before the execution warrant was scheduled

24

to be carried out.

argument also is that you wouldn't have to present the

2

Brady claim in order, so long as it's still alive, to

3

challenge the prior question of the district court's using

4

the wrong gateway?
MR. O'BRIEN:

That's correct.

This is -- the

issues in this case involve the gateway.
QUESTION:

7

If it used the wrong gateway, then it

would be sent back down for proper consideration of the

That's exactly correct, Your

So the Brady claim was still alive,

but you didn't have to argue it in the court of appeals.

14

MR. O'BRIEN:

15

QUESTION:

Exactly.

Exactly, and we were --

Mr. O'Brien, going to the gateway

standard, do you read Kuhlmann and Carrier as establishing

or affirming equivalent tests?

Is there a difference, at least

as -- taking the Carrier formulation, is there a

1

difference between that and what might rise to the level

2

of a Herrera claim?

3

MR. O'BRIEN:

Herrera is -- yes.

I'm not sure.

4

I mean, I hope, as Justice O'Connor said in Herrera,

5

hopefully the Court will never have to address the Herrera

6

claim, because I think if the case gets this far and there

7

is still compelling evidence of innocence, such as in this

8

case, then it's likely that something, that these
constitutional rights that exist to ensure the reliability

10

of the result probably were violated somewhere down the

11

line.

12

There's

13

QUESTION:

14

the Carrier formulation?

15
16

But in any case, you'll settle for

MR. O'BRIEN:

I would settle for the Carrier

formulation, Your Honor.

17

QUESTION:

Isn't there going to be some

18

awkwardness if we have two different standards, one for

1

guilt and one for sentence?

20

both an aggravating circumstance and an element of the

21

crime, so would you say that, so far as there was an

22

aggravating circumstance, you would analyze it under the

23

Sawyer standard but, in so far as an element of the crime,

24

you would analyze the same facts under the Kuhlmann

25

standard?

MR. O'BRIEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, there is a

phrase in your opinion in Sawyer that indicates that may

3

be so, but I disagree.

I believe the fundamental distinction between an

5

innocent person and a person who is convicted of the wrong

6

crime, or a lesser crime, and the first question in that

7

second situation you hypothesized is whether or not that

8

is a fundamental miscarriage of justice at all.

9

The circuits below are split on that issue of

10

whether or not a sentencing claim in a noncapital case or

11

a lesser included offense innocence claim is a miscarriage

12

of justice.

13

QUESTION:

But no matter how you come out, it

14

seems to me, there is going to be an unavoidable

15

complication if you have two standards, one for guilt and

16

one for sentence, in a case like Sawyer, where the proof

17

of arson was both an aggravating circumstance and an

18

element of a crime.

19

MR. O'BRIEN:

As I said, Your Honor, I believe

20

that for Mr. Schlup's situation I think that it would not

21

be too confusing, or too difficult, and there's always a

22

cost involved in the exercise of habeas corpus

23

jurisdiction.

25

context of an innocent person, and whenever it has said

QUESTION:

what standard are we going to require to prove innocence.

5

We're not talking about whether innocence shall be

that your insistence on two different standards is going

8

to complicate things.
MR. O'BRIEN:

9

â€¢

Yes, but here we're talking about

Your Honor, I believe innocence of

10

the crime and innocence of the sentence are two situations

11

that require two standards, and this Court does not apply

12

one uniform standard across the board whenever it devises

13

a standard for harmless error, or prejudice, or in some
other context.

It looks at the interests involved and the

14

15

equities involved in exercising habeas corpus

jurisprudence -- or jurisdiction, rather, and so it is not

17

inappropriate to have two standards for this, because

Mr. O'Brien, whichever standard we

MR. O'BRIEN:

Of course you come in and say

Your Honor, I disagree that having

a miscarriage-of-justice standard will always frustrate

In this case -- and this Court applies many

10

standards, and I believe that's where in Kuhlmann the term

"colorable claim" comes in.

MR. O'BRIEN:

2

There's a pleading standard, that

I believe that the courts are capable of looking at

pleadings and attachments and affidavits, as we did below,

attached to the pleadings, that would allow the court to

MR. O'BRIEN:

Yes, they do and, Your Honor, in

this case, I believe in your observation in Sawyer you

13

stated that in order to satisfy the Kuhlmann test a

prisoner, in addition to the habeas, would have to tender

to the court reliable, noncumulative, and admissible

Mr. Green made this statement before anybody

Mr. Green did not make that call.
QUESTION:

Have you introduced evidence as to

who received that call and what that person says?

4

MR. O'BRIEN:

We have in the court below filed a

executive clemency proceedings, and there is a corrections

officer named Kerrs who received a call.

shouting going on in the background, and she believes that

does not recall the identity of the caller.

But that, plus Roger Flowers' testimony that

14

before he went in to break up the fight, he turned to

15

someone and said, call base, or get help, or words to that

upon in its discussion.

Eberle, according to Sergeant Flowers, arrived in the

MR. O'BRIEN:

And as Justice O'Connor pointed out in

Your Honor, the probability of

innocence, I believe, is what the law is and what it

should be, because a standard higher than that will not

reach other innocent people, but Mr. Schlup's position is

that we could prevail under any standard that is less

to make here in this case is that petitioner is arguing

from a policy or a precedent standpoint.

A uniform standard for guilt and penalty phases,

17

and guilt and penalty regardless of whether it's a capital

QUESTION:

But isn't it also the case that in

any ultimate resolution of the penalty phase there is a

kind of value judgment goes with it, that is made by the

we're dealing with penalty.

is a different kind of determination from the guilt

aggravating circumstance, of the objective proof necessary

2

to prove an objective factor making someone eligible for

the death penalty, is not, in your estimation, different

4

from what's necessary to prove their guilt.

5

QUESTION:

That is in some cases going to be

6

true, but the ultimate determination that has to be made

7

in a Sawyer kind of case is a determination which must

8

take into consideration the ultimate discretion to make a

value judgment as distinct from the discretion to make a

10

factual judgment.

11

GENERAL NIXON:

12

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

And that's going to be true in every

Sawyer case regardless of how the Sawyer case,

14

particularly, is presented.

15

GENERAL NIXON:

Yes, Your Honor, unless you find

16

that so narrow a holding of the Sawyer is that it just

17

deals with capital cases just on the issue of death, but I

18

think if you bring it to the context of penalty and guilt,

and intermesh it into a system, that those same arguments

are not strong.

of being able to raise claims of innocence in subsequent

to that be the difference between the Kuhlmann formulation

15

and the Carrier formulation, because the Kuhlmann

formulation goes to, I guess, fair probability of

reasonable doubt, whereas Carrier talks about probability

of innocence, and one could see, and I'm not saying that

under our cases one should, but one could see the

distinction as being the distinction between legal

innocence and factual innocence, and if Carrier were read

committed the act but has not been shown to have done so

That's not hard.

I was relying -- I was referring

to the standard, Your Honor, not to the ultimate decision,

Well, I was talking, one standard

talks about reasonable doubt, one standard talks about

innocence.

clear that there is this distinction between legal and

21

factual innocence?

22

Why are they hard to separate, if we make it

GENERAL NIXON:

If you draw that distinction,

23

Your Honor, then it is much easier to come to the

24

conclusion you did, but I would submit that the fair

I appreciate that, Your Honor.

So your view on why that is not the

GENERAL NIXON:

13

It's that the Sawyer standard is

the --my understanding of this, and correct me if I'm

is that we're talking about a person in general who has

20

some kind of a claim that his trial was unconstitutional

21

or held in violation of the laws of the United States.

22

He's already had one habeas proceeding.

Now he

It could

of it is what Henry Friendly said is -- well, what that

is, is if the trier of fact -- I'm the habeas judge,

13

imagine -- if the trier of fact would have entertained a

14

reasonable doubt of guilt.

15

once said the judge should ask himself, and I take it

Kuhlmann basically picked that up, not using exactly those

17

words.

Now, what's that?

And my reading

That's what Henry Friendly

And then, if you're going to use that standard,

19

I'll tell you one variety of miscarriage of justice, if

20

you, judge, sitting there, think that the trier of fact at

21

the trial had seen all this evidence he would have found a

22

reasonable doubt.

Now, that's basically the Kuhlmann standard, and

4

Having sat in a court of appeals, I would agree,

All right, my question is, we're talking about

5

an exception that comes up rarely, why do you need a

6

tougher standard than that, that the judge should sit

7

there, ask himself conscientiously, with all this stuff in

8

here, all the evidence, would that trier of fact have had

9

a reasonable doubt, would have, not some theoretical

10

speculation?
If I believe the answer to that question is yes,

I should at least listen to the constitutional claim, and

my statement of it may be wrong, in which case, correct

me, but if not, then what is the answer to that?

GENERAL NIXON:

(Laughter.)

17

GENERAL NIXON:

You're close, Your Honor.

Judge Friendly's standard, we

would say, is a good standard for habeases, and would

argue that that's what Kuhlmann said.

GENERAL NIXON:

He said, to

7

He talked about the explosion

And in this case, it's not, it's a successive,

8

or we're later on in the process, and plus, Your Honor, I

9

just deeply believe that the fair probability standard

10

that has been written in Kuhlmann, as the interpretation

11

of what Friendly's colorable showing, an entertaining, is

12

far too imprecise.

13

It mirrors the Strickland test, it mirrors the

14

new trial test, it doesn't penalize later claims, and it

15

doesn't set a line for trial courts and appellate courts

16

to make these decisions, and thus, I think it makes

17

problems, and I believe that it doesn't do what it's

18

designed to do.

Maybe if it's the first one, it makes more

Sawyer did it for the penalty phase, and this

3

presents the opportunity to provide that same standard,

4

that clear and convincing for abusive and successive, in

5

the guilt phase of these cases also, to draw the single

6

standard across the line, to draw one that provides

safeguards, provides, as I indicated to Justice Scalia,

8

some opportunities --

QUESTION:

Across the line, or were you

10

conceding that the Friendly position is okay for the first

11

habeas, but after that it's not?

12

GENERAL NIXON:

Generally yes, Justice Ginsburg.

13

So this Court is faced with the opportunity to

14

draw that line at the point, and I would argue that it did

15

it already in Sawyer, dealing with objective, specific

16

evidence.

QUESTION:
