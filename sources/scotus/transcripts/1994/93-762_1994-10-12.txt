ORAL ARGUMENT OF BEN BARNOW

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER JEROME B. GRUBART, INC.
MR. BARNOW:

10
11

12

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
In furtherance of the divided argument, I intend

13

on concentrating on nonpreemption argument issues.

14

Mr. Rosenthal intends on concentrating on the city's

15

preemption argument.

16

On April 13, 1992, the Chicago Loop flooded.

17

Thousands of persons and businesses suffered losses

18

estimated upwards of $1 billion.

19

has now come to be known as the Chicago Flood, resulted

20

from two occurrences.

21

failure to maintain or repair an extensive underground

22

tunnel system under the City of Chicago.

23

the pile-driving activities which occurred on the North

24

Branch of the Chicago River to protect the Kinzie Street

25

Bridge, which had been completed more than 6 months

This catastrophe, which

The second was

earlier.
The pile-driving work was performed by Great

Lakes Dredge & Dock Company,

4

accomplished this work using a tractor crane positioned on

5

top of a spud scow which had been posted into the river

bed and which was being used as a stationary platform.

7

the respondent here.

On these facts, the Seventh Circuit,

8

reversing the district court,

9

jurisdiction existed.

10

It

in

found that admiralty

In order to accomplish this,

it had

to do two things:
1) acting alone from the other circuits which

11
12

have considered similar situations, it refused to adopt or

13

use the totality-of-the-circumstances approach.

14

Secondly, it misapplied the rulings of this

15

Court.

It did that by misconstruing every ingredient that

16

this Court indicated in Sisson and the cases before it,

17

Executive Jet, and Foremost required.

18

QUESTION:

Didn't our Sisson decision pretty

19

well reject totality-of - the - circumstances test which you

20

refer to?

21

MR. BARNOW:

22

In footnote numbers 3 and 4,

Not the way I read it.
the Court

23

recognizes that the circuits were employing the totality-

24

1

adequate guidance.

It never said that no other circuit

2

could continue to use that.
However, even if it did for the facts of that

3
4

particular case, where all of the activities were uniform,

5

were the same, it left open the door as to what the case

6

would be where the instrumentalities were involved in

7

different activities.
I would offer to the Court that in this

8

9

particular case, we have myriad activities.

The City of

10

Chicago alone is engaged in at least two nonmaritime

11

activities.

bridge.

13

14

One is the construction or maintenance of a

The second is, is the maintenance of their

We then have the nonmaritime activities of all

15

of the other instrumentalities, all of the people like

16

Grubart and the businesses and buildings in the Chicago

17

Loop, which are far away, none of whom were engaged in any

18

activity which, under any argument, could be maritime.

19

QUESTION:

Isn't that an argument against the

20

Extension Act?

21

every case in which there is, in effect, a land-based

22

injury?

23

Isn't that going to be true in virtually

MR. BARNOW:

No, Your Honor, and the reason is,

24

is that when this Court developed the nexus test it did it

25

to find a substantial connection between the activity and

traditional maritime activity.
Unfortunately, and one of the other errors that

3

the Seventh Circuit committed, was that it allowed the

4

Admiralty Extension Act to bootstrap this Court's

5

requirement, and skipped it.

6

If you are to separate the Admiralty Extension

7

Act from a nexus requirement, which this Court cannot

8

intend, what it would be doing is, defeat its own opinion.
It would take all land-based injuries and put them in a

10

special category, and allow them to have admiralty

11

jurisdiction without any connection to traditional

12

maritime activity.

13
14

QUESTION:

Congress' authority to do that if it chooses?

15

MR. BARNOW:

16

don't believe it has.

17

Incidentally, you don't question the

QUESTION:

If it chooses to do that, but I
It set up no independent -Congress can define admiralty

18

jurisdiction any way it wants, even though it's a

constitutional term.

20

MR. BARNOW:

The definition has been left open,

21

as Your Honor is aware, and this Court has defined and

22

determined that definition.

23

the Commerce Clause, for instance, frankly, I'm not sure.

24

What I do know is, is that it has not done so here.

2

purports to be defining admiralty jurisdiction in a way

3

differently than this Court has done, does that cause a

constitutional problem with reference to the authority of

the Congress to define what admiralty jurisdiction means?
MR. BARNOW:

Frankly,

This Court has said that the activity from which

12

13

the incident arises must have a substantial relationship

14

to traditional maritime activity, not any relationship but

a substantial relationship, and Your Honor is right with

QUESTION:

7

Mr. Barnow, may I ask you to get

8

specific in applying the third Sisson prong?

It's proper

9

under the third Sisson prong to consider, I presume, not

10

only what Great Lakes was doing but what the City of

11

Chicago was doing, and your argument seems to be that the

12

City of Chicago was simply maintaining, or for that matter

13

failing to maintain a tunnel, and there's nothing with any

14

maritime character to maintaining a tunnel, is that

15

basically it?

16
17
18

MR. BARNOW:

That's basically it on the point.

I'm -QUESTION:

Well, may I ask you, then, is it also

19

proper, or isn't it also proper under Sisson, to consider

20

the fact that the City of Chicago I presume had some role

21

in maintaining this navigable water?

22

Didn't the City of Chicago sort of maintain its

23

banks, wasn't it the City of Chicago's bridge over the

24

navigable water that was being repaired, and shouldn't

1

channel of navigable water also be considered under

2

Sisson, and if they are, doesn't the claimed absurdity

3

shrink somewhat?
MR. BARNOW:

4

Well, first, I'm buoyed by the

5

Court's use of these additional inquiries, because Sisson

6

doesn't tell you how to make those additional inquiries.
When Sisson is served by the totality-of -the-

7
8

circumstances inquiry, then those types of inquiries can
be made.

For instance, Your Honor said, shouldn't we also

10

take into account, or shouldn't -- doesn't the Sisson test

11

also take into account the additional activity, the

12

activity of the City of Chicago?

Where?

In the literal reading, it says, one activity,

13
14

but Your Honor couldn't do that.

When he thought about

15

the situation, Your Honor had to look at all of the

16

activities, and that was recognized in Sisson.
Sisson said, what are we going to do when that

17
18

occurs, and all the totality-of-the-circumstances says,

1

and all -- the only thing all of these circuits have been

20

saying is, we hear this Court's ruling, but in order to

21

answer a very important part of it, we have to articulate

22

these other questions, otherwise these questions really go

23

sub rosa.

getting to the judgment, the more likely you are to serve

QUESTION:

Well,

is your claim, then,

that what

3

the lower court did in effect was simply to isolate the

12

Well, whether it does or not,

is that

13

what you're saying the court did, that it isolated --

consistently or inconsistently with Sisson,

to misdefining all the ingredients.

It picked the wrong

nothing to do with it, but that would be the equality in

I believe it could.

Well, why isn't the flood the

MR. BARNOW:

Because it does not encompass all

you do not have the incident for the event.

Why would we look to the damages?

Take the Federal Tort Claims Act, for example.

1

Lakes conduct occurred on the river, and not where the

2

damage occurred?

3

MR. BARNOW:

Well, I have no problem with the

4

Court looking to where the conduct occurred, but where the

5

conduct occurred was on a stationary barge which had been

6

spudded in to the river bed, which more likely is a work

7

platform, bears more resemblance to a dock, or a derrick

8

rig, than it does to a vessel.

9

Grubart's position has been, is that that wasn't

10

even a vessel, and that there is no test that is before

11

this Court that would find admiralty jurisdiction under

to start by identifying the cause of action with

this case is not how a boat was spudded down on navigable

seaworthiness.

21

The cause of action here, to be precise, is an

22

alleged lack of due care, when driving pilings through

subsoil, for underground tunnels in the area, a cause of

action that didn't arise on the water, in the water, it

that if a claim is brought against two joint tortfeasors,

it possible, if you have a tort caused by the negligent

actions of two different people, that one of them would be

11

suable only in admiralty and the other one would not be

12

suable in admiralty?

13

dual causality, it's quite possible that the City of

Chicago can't be sued in admiralty, and that the barge

15

company must be sued in admiralty, isn't that possible?

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, and then added to that, of

course, admiralty's traditional liberal joinder rules, and

disagree with, what is it, the Maritime Law Association,

made by the Maritime Law Association, that if your

2

limitation act claim fails, if the district court should

3

decide Great Lakes is not entitled to limit its liability,

4

then the district court would have the option, in effect,

5

of remanding the case to the State court, at which point

6

you said it loses its water equality and goes over to be

just an ordinary, garden variety tort suit, but the

8

Maritime Law Association says where the claimants,

9

Grubart, may pursue their actions under the saving to

11

maritime law, so - MR. ROBERTS:

12

The question of what law to apply,

and this gets into the city's argument, is a different

14

question from whether or not there is admiralty

15

jurisdiction.

16

should turn on preemption analysis, choice of law

reason he gave was that if they did, we would have to look

at each admiralty claim and say, does this arise under

and he said, that type of analysis is inappropriate at the

as it was in 1959.
QUESTION:

No.

It is up to the discretion of

the claims that were brought in ancillary to the admiralty

they arise out of the same general occurrence that gave

If the activity of the pleasure yacht in Sisson,

tied up at the dock doing nothing, is traditional maritime

activity, then surely the activities of this commercial

vessel out on the navigable waters, plying its trade for

QUESTION:

So your picture is that the Grubart

claimants should remain in State court with their

8

lawsuits, they just sit there, till the district court

9

decides the limitation question.

10

11

If no limitation, then

those ordinary tort claims go forward in State court.
MR. ROBERTS:

The claimants are in the admiralty

12

case under rule 14, and the city is brought in.

13

Therefore, the city must defend its claims, Grubart's

14

claims against the city under rule 14 practice, but if --

15

taking the whole thing from the beginning, if the Grubarts

16

had just sued the city, that's not an admiralty case

occur on navigable waters.

have something to say, and by protecting the drawbridge

4

they protect maritime commerce, because, of course, if the

5

drawbridge didn't work, the commerce couldn't get through.

6

The relation to maritime commerce here is as strong as in

7

any case to come before this Court since Executive Jet.

9

Looking at the injury, taking into account, as
they say, the totality of the circumstances, and focusing

10

on where the injury occurred, is, in our view,

11

inconsistent with the Admiralty Extension Act.

12

that in two identical cases, one in which the injury is

13

felt on navigable water, and the other in which the injury

14

is felt on land, there will be jurisdiction in the former

15

but not in the latter, despite the clear direction from

16

Congress to the contrary.

17

It means

The test they propose, a totality of the

18

circumstances, seven-factor, policy-based balancing test,

19

is wholly unsuited to the jurisdictional inquiry.

20

Jurisdictional rules need to be clear, precise, easy to

21

apply, and lead to predictable results.

22

Totality-of - the - circumstances balancing tests

23

are by their nature vague, indeterminate, manipulable, and

24

lead to different results, depending on who does the

25

balancing, a particular concern in jurisdictional cases,

because, of course, any appellate court must look at the

2

question of jurisdiction sua sponte and reevaluate it as a

3

matter of law.

4

The Sisson test is more structured, it is more

5

focused, it limits the activities that are pertinent, it

6

doesn't look at injured parties, what they were doing, it

7

focuses on what took place on navigable water.
We have in this case an incident on navigable

water that closed the Chicago River for more than a month.

10

It arose from traditional maritime activity.

The

11

conclusion of the Seventh Circuit that that case was

12

within admiralty was correct, and should be affirmed.

REBUTTABLE ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE ROSENTHAL

16

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER CITY OF CHICAGO

17

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Mr. Roberts discussed many

18

causes of action except the one that is actually before

19

the Court, because this is the first time that this Court

20

is asked to put any cause of action arising further inland

21

than the reach of the vessel and its appurtenances into

22

admiralty.

23

The Extension Act does not put every cause of

24

action arising from ship-to-shore injury into admiralty.

overruled, and there would be serious constitutional

2

questions about the validity of the Extension Act if no

3

nexus to Federal interests in maritime commerce were

4

required.
We read the Extension Act as it was read in the

5
6

Askew case to require a preemption-based analysis.

7

is, indeed, no such thing as an admiralty case that does

8

not provide for the displacement of State law with Federal

9

law.

10

There

As this Court said in the East River Steamship

11

case, with admiralty jurisdiction comes the application of

12

substantive maritime law.

QUESTION:

Admiralty jurisdiction is --

Which may sometimes refer to State

law, however.
MR. ROSENTHAL:

That's correct, and it's up to

16

Federal district courts, not State legislatures, to decide

17

what rule, and whenever there is an applicable Federal

18

rule, that Federal rule will always trump State law.

19

That is why I say, Justice Scalia, admiralty

20

jurisdiction is inherently preempted, and the test we urge

21

is the preemption test this Court already uses when it

22

asks whether State courts have lost jurisdiction.

23

Thank you.
