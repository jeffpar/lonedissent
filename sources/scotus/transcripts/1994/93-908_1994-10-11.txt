CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Henson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARLTON M. HENSON

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. HENSON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This is yet another, and hopefully the last, in

11

a series of cases involving the State's unconstitutional

12

taxation of Federal retirement benefits.

13

1985, when Federal retirees first filed suit in Georgia.

14

Federal retirees across this country have been trying to

15

collect refunds of taxes that were illegally and

16

unconstitutionally collected from them by the States.

17

Since at least

In 1989 in Davis, this Court confirmed that a

18

State may not impose an income tax on Federal retirement

19

benefits if it simultaneously provides an exemption from

20

State retirement benefits.

21

Two years later in Barker, the Court confirmed

22

that the holding in Davis applied to military retirement

23

benefits, and in 1993, in Harper, this Court confirmed

24

that its decision in Davis must be applied retroactively.

25

Harper, however, stopped short of awarding refunds.

1

Thus, after almost a decade of effort by Federal

2

retirees, this case ultimately presents the question of

3

whether the Constitution requires refunds to Federal

4

retirees under the circumstances here presented.

5

This question has already been answered in the

6

affirmative by this Court.

As the Court held in McKesson,

7

our precedents establish that if a State penalizes

8

taxpayers for failure to remit their taxes in timely

9

fashion, the Due Process Clause requires the State to

10

afford taxpayers a meaningful opportunity to secure post

11

payment relief.

12

Further, the Court held that if a State avails

13

itself of this approach, establishing various sanctions

14

and summary remedies designed so that taxpayers tender tax

15

payments before the objections are entertained and

16

resolved, the State does not provide a meaningful

17

predeprivation hearing.

18

Georgia does not dispute that it has established

19

summary sanctions, summary remedies and sanctions here,

20

nor does it dispute that the purpose of these sanctions

21

and remedies is designed to ensure payment.

22

On page 30 of the brief of the respondents, they

23

write, "Georgia's statutory provisions concerning the

24

nonpayment of taxes are all reasonable measures designed

25

to see that taxes are paid if they are legally owed."

QUESTION:

1

Well, Mr. Henson, in your view, what

2

can a State do to ensure that taxes are paid without

3

running afoul of this coercion, or whatever you want to

4

call it?
MR. HENSON:

5
6

to provide meaningful --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. HENSON:

9

Without triggering the requirement

Yes.
-- backward-looking relief?

O'Connor talks about reasonably equal terms, and Harper

10

references constitutionally significant duress, so by

11

implication there's some level where there is

12

constitutionally insignificant duress, or the terms might

13

be unequal but not reasonably unequal.

14

I don't have a specific formula to present to

15

the Court.

16

rule, then I think parity is one that's fairly read from

17

the cases, but this case is far beyond anything that the

18

Court -QUESTION:

19
20

MR. HENSON:

25

I don't think there's any question

that McKesson clearly holds that.

23
24

Well, can a State require payment

under protest?

21
22

If the States are looking for a bright line

QUESTION:

And payment, rather than just

protest.
MR. HENSON:

I think that's clear from McKesson,

Your Honor.

2

though, are much more severe than just some minimal

3

requirement that the taxpayer pay under protest.

4

The sanctions that the State has here,

QUESTION:

Would you agree that if the State's

5

insurance consisted of a lien and interest running on any

6

unpaid balance at something substantially equivalent to

7

market rate, that that would create no problem?
MR. HENSON:

8

9
10

Honor.

I think that's a closer case, Your

I think that probably would satisfy the McKesson

standard.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. HENSON:

What about the posting of a bond?
By itself, no financial sanctions,

13

no penalty, in that case, Your Honor, I think that's very

14

much like the Chief Justice's pay-under-protest

15

hypothetical, basically.

16

QUESTION:

Well, when you say no penalty, does

17

that assume that if the taxpayer prevails, he's entitled

18

to reimbursement for the bond premium?

19

MR. HENSON:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. HENSON:

22

23

Well -Suppose he's out the bond premium?
I'm sorry, I didn't hear the

question.
QUESTION:

Suppose the taxpayer has to pay for

24

the cost of the bond premium, and there's no reimbursement

25

in the event he prevails.

1

MR. HENSON:

That, to my ear that sounds like he

2

runs afoul of McKesson.

3

the -- more than just insignificant duress.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. HENSON:

6

That -- that is more than just

What if -That's a real cost that the

taxpayer begins to bear there.

7

QUESTION:

Yes.

8

QUESTION:

He could pay under protest --

9

MR. HENSON:

10

QUESTION:

That's right.
-- instead of doing that, and that

11

would be okay.

He has the option of either paying under

12

protest, or posting a bond.

13

MR. HENSON:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. HENSON:

All right.
That would be okay, wouldn't it?
I think you're right, Your Honor.

16

Of course, what we have here is far more severe than

17

either of those hypotheticals.

18

QUESTION:

Let me just ask a little bit about

19

what we have here.

Suppose you have, hypothetically, a

20

State with an adequate predeprivation remedy, and it also

21

has a refund statute.

22

route, and the refund statute's repealed.

23

MR. HENSON:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. HENSON:

The taxpayer elects the refund

Ex post facto?
Yes.
I think that would be

unconstitutional, Your Honor.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. HENSON:

Is that what happened here?
Well, it was rep -- effectively,

4

yes.

5

statute applied to these Federal retirees, and the

6

respondents repeatedly wrote in briefs before the Georgia

7

supreme court and in other courts of Georgia that -- there

8

were Georgia supreme court cases on point.

9

There was absolutely no doubt that the refund

QUESTION:

Isn't the problem that Georgia

10

supreme court said, no, it doesn't apply to a

11

constitutionally invalid tax, that's what our law is now,

12

that's what our law was then, and we have the same right

13

to take the position, in fact obligation, that everything

14

we say about what the law is, was, is fully retroactive,

15

the same right and obligation that the U.S. courts do?

16

MR. HENSON:

If -- if that was the case, I would

17

agree with Your Honor, except here, both the -- the

18

legislative history of the statute clearly established

19

that the purpose of the statute was to provide for refunds

20

of taxes that were later declared unconstitutional.

21

The Georgia supreme court had issued a decision

22

in the Parke, Davis case that expressly held that the

23

refund statute was the appropriate procedure for

24

challenging an unconstitutional tax under the Federal

25

Constitution, in that case a Commerce Clause challenge.

QUESTION:

Well, you --

2

MR. HENSON:

3

QUESTION:

So -Do we have to hold that Georgia

4

changed its law?

I mean, I'm willing to accept what the

5

Georgia supreme court said.

6

that was always Georgia law, it was always Georgia law.

7

But your argument would remain, well, if it was Georgia

8

law, it certainly didn't seem to be Georgia law.
MR. HENSON:

9

QUESTION:

10

If Georgia supreme court says

Precisely, Your Honor.
And -- but isn't that the only point

11

you have to make?

You don't really have to argue that

12

Georgia changed its law.

13

Georgia should have made its law clear so that a taxpayer

14

would know how to get a refund and not be snookered by

15

thinking he could proceed one way and then be told after

16

the fact that he couldn't.

17

MR. HENSON:

18

The rule this --

19

QUESTION:

You only have to argue that

That's exactly right, Your Honor.

Well, is Georgia now, as you

20

understand it, asserting sovereign immunity and just

21

saying, we do not waive our sovereign immunity for

22

backward-looking relief?

23

today?

24
25

MR. HENSON:

Is that what Georgia is saying

That does seem to be their latest

idea, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

1

What if this suit were in Federal

2

court?

3

take that position and defeat a remedy if the suit were in

4

Federal court?

5

Would the Eleventh Amendment enable Georgia to

MR. HENSON:

I think we would have a problem

under the Eleventh Amendment with respect to the

7

Department of Revenue as a defendant.

8

individual claims against Marcus Collins as the Revenue

9

Commissioner, my understanding of the Court's

12

13

jurisprudence is that we would not.
QUESTION:

With respect to the

I think that --

But you say that if the suit is in

the State's own court it can't assert sovereign immunity.
MR. HENSON:

Well, no, Your Honor, not under the

14

circumstances of this case, and particularly here.

15

know, they put this forward as a threshold issue regarding-

16

the State's interpretation of its own sovereign immunity.

17

You

Well, presumably the Georgia supreme court is

18

part of the sovereign, and presumably it's a pretty good

19

arbiter of what the sovereign immunity would be, but they

20

stepped right over that threshold.

21

for a nanosecond to get to the merits of this issue.

22

didn't have any problem with sovereign immunity.

23

QUESTION:

They didn't hesitate
They

Well, this is a pretty Pyrrhic

24

victory, then, for -- maybe not for your clients, but

25

certainly for future taxpayers who are treated similarly.

1

You're saying that all the State has to do is enact a

2

statute closing its doors to claims for retroactive tax

3

relief.

4

MR. HENSON:

5

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.
I thought you said that.

They can't

6

come into Federal court, and so long as the State closes

7

the State court, where do you expect them to sue, in

8

another State?

9

MR. HENSON:

I'm not suggesting for a moment,

10

Your Honor, that the State can close the door.

11

suggesting that this Court need not reach that issue here

12

because the Georgia supreme court did not reach it.

13

However, I do believe that this Court's precedents

14

establish that the Fourteenth Amendment prevails over

15

sovereign immunity in cases such as this.

16

Carpenter v. Shaw is this case.

I'm simply

It was a case

17

brought against the Oklahoma State auditor.

18

where the Court recognized that refunds were going to be

19

paid out of the State Treasury.

20

awarding refunds in this case.

21

It was a case

The Court had no problem

In Ward v. Love, it was a case involving a

22

county defendant, but the Court expressly distinguished

23

the sovereign immunity issues raised in Ex Parte Young.

24

It said, this is not Ex Parte Young because this is a

25

takings case under the Fourteenth Amendment.

QUESTION:

1

Well, Mr. Henson, what if we decide

2

this point the way you want us to.

Is that going to open

3

the States up, States if they don't have a tort claims

4

act?

5

we're injured, we've got a right to sue you for whatever

6

damages we've got, even though you haven't waived

7

sovereign immunity?

Are they going to be met with the argument, well, if

8

MR. HENSON:

9

QUESTION:

I'm not sure I under -Well, if sovereign immunity is not a

10

defense on the part of the State, even though -- which has

11

not waived it for a claim for a tax refund, how about a

12

constitutional claim, or asserted claim for other kinds of

13

injuries, personal injuries, say, at the behest of a State

14

vehicle, or something like that?

15

argument be equally available to them?

16

MR. HENSON:

Why wouldn't that

Well, I believe the Court's

17

jurisprudence in the Fourteenth Amendment area is what

18

answers the question for this case.

19

I'm not familiar enough with the Court's

20

decisions under the Tort Claims Act that would resolve

21

that for other areas, but I think the Carpenter v. Shaw,

22

Ward v. Love, the bank cases,

23

that question, at least for unconstitutional deprivation

24

through taxing and, indeed, I think the rule that the

25

Court has enunciated in McKesson has been consistently

I think they clearly answer

applied, and I don't think the State really disputes, as I

2

pointed out, that it has these sanctions, it has these

3

remedies.

4

Indeed, much of the State's briefing is

5

designed, or answers, deals with this issue of this

6

critical need to have sanctions and summary remedies, but

7

that issue's been decided.

8

the Court noted in McKesson, the Court has long held that

9

the State may impose such sanctions and remedies in tax

That's not the issue here.

10

cases, but if a State establishes those sanctions and

11

summary remedies, it does not provide a meaningful

12

predeprivation hearing.

13

As

In McKesson, the Court described the meaningful

14

predeprivation hearing again as the root requirement of

15

due process, and when a State does not provide this root

16

requirement, it must provide backward-looking relief.

17

That's the trade-off.

That's the price, and it's not a

statute.

Are you saying that the system that

6

Georgia now has in place -- let's say there has been no

appearance that there was a refund remedy available, and

what Georgia now lists as its remedies is all there is,

9

and it's clear that in this class of cases there's no

refund remedy.

11

sets out and says it now has for this category of cases,

12

would that be constitutionally adequate?

13

Would the list of remedies that Georgia

MR. HENSON:

No, Your Honor, because of the

14

summary remedies and sanctions that the State has

15

established, and they concede in their brief they've

16

established these, and they concede that the purpose of

17

these is to require taxpayers to make payment.

18

constitutionally permissible, but because the State

19

chooses to have these remedies, it must provide meaningful

20

backward-looking relief.

21

QUESTION:

They are

I mean, that's the issue, is --

Isn't the State saying that if you --

22

if there's been an assessment and you appealed it

23

successfully, you would lose nothing, you would not --

24

there would be no penalty, and the only thing you would

25

lose is the bond premium?

All the while, while you're litigating your

this case.

QUESTION:

Do I understand you correctly that

3

you're not seeking a refund back to 1980, that it's only

4

3 years back from the first time you made a protest noise,

5

is that correct?

6

MR. HENSON:

Well, that's correct, Your Honor.

7

That was my mistake.

I foolishly believed that the refund

8

statute applied in this case, and that the limitation

9

period in the refund statute would preclude us from going

10

back,

so when we appealed from the trial court, the trial

11

court applied the refund statute to this petitioner and

12

said, the limitation period precludes you.

13

I thought it was so clear that it applied, I did

14

not appeal that part of the judgment, so those tax years

are not properly before the Court.

I mean, in Florida the State had waived it.
MR. HENSON:

Well, that's an interesting point,

3

Your Honor.

I'm not sure I agree with that proposition.

4

McKesson and Harper are very similar to the case here in

5

that regard, because in both instances the whole predicate

6

of the cases being here was that the State refund statute

7

did not apply as a matter of State law, so if it doesn't

8

apply in Harper and McKesson, yet the court sovereign

9

immunity does not preclude the court reviewing it, then

10

why should it preclude review here, and I think the answer

11

is, it doesn't.

12

It's a Fourteenth Amendment claim.

That's the

13

way the Court treated it in McKesson.

That's the way it

14

treated it in Harper, and that's the way it is here, and

15

that's consistent, as I suggested, with the Court's

16

jurisprudence beginning with O'Connor, Carpenter v. Shaw,

Ward v. Love, and those cases.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WARREN R. CALVERT
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

10
11

MR. CALVERT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As recognized in Harper, a State which has
provided predeprivation due process to a taxpayer is under

15

no obligation to return amounts which the taxpayer chooses-

16

instead to pay,

17

the tax in question was unconstitutional.

18

Now,

even if it is subsequently determined that

the petitioner in this case had available

19

to him under Georgia law numerous predeprivation remedies

by which he could have contested Georgia's income tax

treatment of his Federal retirement benefits.

There's the possibility of an

Now, of course, initially, the State Revenue

You believe it, or there are cases to

that effect?
MR. CALVERT:

There are no cases that have

12

interpreted that section, Your Honor, and I submit the

13

reason that's the case is because there simply have been

no instances where the Revenue Department has tried to

assert that penalty in situations where it was arguable

16

that the taxpayer had a reasonable basis for his argument.

judicial determination of that.
QUESTION:

would be the Commissioner's discretion about whether this

was a reasonable action on the taxpayer's part?

MR. CALVERT:

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

And you're saying there are cases

7

which the taxpayer has lost on the merits before the

Commissioner, but which -- in which he did not attempt to

impose any penalty?

10

MR. CALVERT:

I'm not aware of any instance,

11

Your Honor, where the Revenue Department has, in fact,

12

attempted to impose this penalty on someone who has

13

contested their liability.

16

QUESTION:

Is there also a potential criminal

penalty in Georgia for nonpayment of taxes when due?
MR. CALVERT:

There are two criminal statutes to

which the petitioner in this case refers.

19

court prior to the time when the return for the first tax

in it, and it's -- we submit that a taxpayer who has

pursued a reasonable argument pursuant to an accepted

predeprivation procedure in Georgia has not acted wilfully

Again, there are no cases, I suppose.

MR. CALVERT:

The particular --

of the two criminal statutes in question, the one that is

QUESTION:

Would a reasonable taxpayer in

Georgia in the 1980's have assumed that a post deprivation

unconstitutional tax?

1

QUESTION:

Yes.

2

MR. CALVERT:

The Georgia supreme court

3

concluded that one of the predeprivation remedies that

4

could have been brought by these taxpayers was an action

5

for declaratory or injunctive relief prior to the time

6

when the taxes were due.

7

QUESTION:

And the statute on page 20 of the

8

blue brief, Georgia 48-7-84, on its face says no action

9

for the purpose of restraining the assessment shall be

10

maintained in any court.
It's hard for me to square that with our

11
12

requirement that there be a clear avenue of predeprivation

13

relief for the taxpayer.

14

MR. CALVERT:

Your Honor, one thing we would

15

like to note is, until the filing of the brief in this

16

Court, the petitioner had never mentioned that particular

17

code section, had never pointed it out to the parties or

18

to the Georgia supreme court as representing a bar to that

19

particular type of action.
QUESTION:

20

Well, then, the Georgia supreme court

21

might be wrong in saying there's an injunctive possibility

here?

generally that there can be no judicial interference with

the collection or levy of taxes in general, that that --

that 48-7-84 would be interpreted as no bar to an action

8

for injunction where the tax was alleged to be

9

unconstitutional.

However, we think, based on the Georgia

QUESTION:

10

Well, the question is whether or not

11

this was clear to the taxpayer at the time, and the

12

Georgia supreme court cites, as I recall, a sales tax

13

case, Beam, and this is a statute that applies to income

15

MR. CALVERT:

Well,

I believe, Your Honor, that ■

17

we dispute the taxpayer's statement of the standard of

18

clarity that a predeprivation remedy has to provide before

19

it can satisfy a State's due process obligations.

20

What the Court has indicated in McKesson and

21

Harper is that a State must provide a fair opportunity to

22

litigate your liabilities, and a clear and certain remedy

23

in the event that you prevail.

MR. CALVERT:

We say it's a predeprivation

procedure that the -QUESTION:

Are you saying that the injunctive

8

action that the supreme court of Georgia suggests was

9

available to the plaintiff was clear and certain before

10
11

12

13

that opinion?
MR. CALVERT:

I submit that it was, Your Honor,

for several reasons.
The Georgia supreme court's decision regarding

14

declaratory and injunctive relief was based on numerous

15

prior Georgia decisions that had talked about the

16

availability of that type of relief where you were talking

17

about unconstitutional taxes.

18

There had also been other cases involving income

19

taxes where those types of actions had been entertained by

20

the Georgia courts notwithstanding 48-7-84 -- for example,

21

the case of Parrish v. Employees' Retirement System, which

22

was an action brought by State retirees immediately after

23

the Davis case, when the Georgia supreme court, when the

Georgia legislature had amended its statutes to provide

State retirees filed an action for declaratory

and injunctive relief against Georgia, contesting the

4

constitutionality of Georgia's new income tax statutes,

5

and the Georgia courts entertained that case and decided

6

it on its merits.

8

QUESTION:

But didn't this petitioner try a

declaratory judgment action, and wasn't he thrown out?
MR. CALVERT:

9

In the Salter case, Your Honor,

10

that was an action that was filed, eventually went to

11

Fulton County Superior Court.

12

filed subsequent to the Davis decision, and after this

13

taxpayer had already paid the taxes that he now wants

returned.

That was an action that was

What happened in that case is, after the Georgia-

16

General Assembly amended the income tax statutes and

the action.

We submit it was moot.

If it please the Court, I'd like to talk

4

specifically about those aspects of the Georgia tax system

which this petitioner contends subjected it to

constitutionally significant duress.

7

Now, it's important to note that the petitioner

is arguing only that he was subject to implied duress.

It's undisputed that in this case he was never so much as

threatened with a levy, attachment, any criminal

prosecution, garnishment, or any other sanctions if he did

not pay the taxes that he now seeks to have refunded.

7

MR. CALVERT:

It's -- certainly we hope so, Your

8

Honor, and the point the court is making is this.

The

9

computer, if you will, made the initial determination that

10

if one has reported a liability as due on your return, and

11

you do not pay it, that that penalty is appropriate.

12

If the taxpayer in this case had filed his

3

return, and removed from the tax base the Federal

4

retirement benefits, the Revenue Department would have

5

been obligated to issue an assessment to him which would

6

have triggered the right to go into court.

to criminal penalties, if he omits it from the return?
MR. CALVERT:

Your Honor, if a taxpayer has made

based on a constitutional objection, I don't see how he

can be subject to criminal prosecution.

objections that had been repeatedly rejected by the

2

courts, simply withdrew himself from the tax system.

3

He filed excess withholding allowances so that

4

he had no withholding on his wages, and he simply didn't

5

file returns, and the Court found in that case that it was

6

inappropriate to have a jury instruction that a sincerely

7

held constitutional believe that wages were not income

8

could subject him from criminal penalties under the

9

Internal Revenue Code under those circumstances.

10

But at the same time, the Court's opinion

11

suggested that if he had filed his return, made full

12

disclosure on his return, and utilized the predeprivation

13

procedures before the United States Tax Court, that that

14

would have been a much different story.

15

And that's what we're suggesting here, that this-

taxpayer had predeprivation remedies available.

5

These taxpayers thought that that would enable

6

them to obtain a refund of taxes that were determined to

7

have been illegally assessed and collected under the laws

8

of Georgia.
Two Federal courts had held that that's what the

9
10

statute meant, and that therefore the Federal Tax

11

Injunction Act applied, since there was an adequate State

12

remedy under this provision and -- among others, and yet

13

you tell me that it was reasonable to expect him to know

14

that this would not apply to that one category of illegal

taxes that consist of taxes unconstitutional under the

Federal Constitution.

17

I mean, if the Georgia supreme court wants to

defendant held money which he was not in equity and good

conscience entitled to hold.

4

There were also -- and we've cited these cases

5

in our brief in opposition to cert in this case.

6

are also many cases where the Georgia courts have found

that where statutes were invalidated, retroactive relief

considerations, unjust results would follow.

MR. CALVERT:

interpretation of the refund statute was drawing upon

these prior principles of Georgia law and extending them

in construing the statute.

MR. CALVERT:

1

Well, Your Honor, I believe the

2

Court's concern, though, has already been addressed and

3

disposed of in the Brinkerhoff case.

4

recognizes, and other cases recognize generally, that --

5

that a court's construction of its own laws, even if it's

6

an unexpected construction, does not necessarily give rise

7

to a due process problem.
In that particular case, in Brinkerhoff, the

8

9

That case

Court found that there was a due process problem.

The

10

taxpayer in Brinkerhoff had pursued the only tax procedure

11

which was then available to him under settled Missouri

12

law.

13

on appeal to the Missouri supreme court.

14

He -- the trial court found against him.

He took it

The Missouri supreme court reversed its prior

15

decisions and announced -- and found a newly announced but-

16

time-barred procedure which it said the taxpayer should

17

have used, and this Court said that under those

18

circumstances, the taxpayer was effectively left without

19

any remedy at law.

20

that the one he chose was not available, and by the time

21

they found that out, the one they said he could have used

22

was not available.

23

He didn't have -- the court had found

But the Court said that absent -- in the absence

24

of a prior construction of the statute by the State's

25

highest court, the plaintiff would have to assume the risk

1

that the ultimate interpretation of the statute might

2

differ from his own.

3

QUESTION:

Any risk at all.

A statute can mean

4

anything in the world, and there's no due process claim.

5

A statute says black, and the supreme court of a State

6

interprets it as white, and that's no due process problem.

7

It reads out the word, not.

8

when it reads no.

9

It reads it as saying yes,

No due process problem at all.

MR. CALVERT:

Your Honor, I don't believe that

10

the Georgia supreme court's reading of the refund statute

11

is that extreme.

12

QUESTION:

I think it is, and is the argument

13

that you're making that no matter how contrary to the

14

words of a statute a supreme court's interpretation is,

15

there is no due process problem so long as it's the first

16

time the court has ever interpreted it?

17

MR. CALVERT:

Your Honor, I believe -- I believe

18

that is the -- that is the holding of the Court in the

19

Brinkerhoff case.

20

QUESTION:

All right.

21

MR. CALVERT:

Again, I submit that that's not --

22

that does not comport with the facts in this case, but I

23

believe Brinkerhoff settles that if a -- that State courts

24

interpret their State procedures and their substantive

25

law, and except in extraordinary circumstances which we

believe are not present in this case -QUESTION:

2

So the answer's no.

You say there

3

are circumstances where that will not comport with due

4

process.

5

MR. CALVERT:

6

QUESTION:

I'm no sure which question --

I asked whether it is always the case

7

that so long as it's the first time a supreme court of a

8

State is interpreting a statute, it can interpret it to

9

mean whatever it wants so long as it's the first time it's

10
11

12

13
14
15

ever interpreted it.

Is that your position?

MR. CALVERT:

I believe that's what Brinkerhoff

stands for.
QUESTION:

All right, but now, most recently

you've said, except in extraordinary circumstances.
MR. CALVERT:

Well, what I -- what I intended to-

16

say, Your Honor, is that the Court in Brinkerhoff

17

indicated that except in extraordinary circumstances an

18

interpretation by a State court of particular procedures

19

available to taxpayers is not going to give rise to due

20

process problems.

21

QUESTION:

Maybe what it meant by extraordinary

22

circumstances was an interpretation that is so flatly

23

contrary to the language of the statute.

24

a pretty extraordinary circumstance to read this language

25

to mean that you can't get a refund.

I consider that

1

MR. CALVERT:

Well, I think there is also one

2

other factor, Your Honor, in Brinkerhoff, which I believe

3

compelled the result in that case, and that is, by virtue

4

of the timing of the Missouri supreme court decisions,

5

this taxpayer was effectively left with never having had

6

an opportunity to contest his liability, and in this

7

particular case there were predeprivation procedures

8

available to the petitioner which he chose not to use.

9

QUESTION:

He chose not to use them because this

10

statute announced to them that he didn't have to use them,

11

that he could always get a refund later.

12

13
14
15

MR. CALVERT:

Well, that was his reading of the

refund statute -QUESTION:

Ah - - and he shouldn't have read it

the way it was written.

16

MR. CALVERT:

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. CALVERT:

And Brinkerhoff --

And Your Honor, and Brinkerhoff

19

stands for the proposition that in the absence of a prior

20

controlling decision by that statute, that's the risk that

21

all litigants run.

QUESTION:

Isn't there -- aren't there two prior

controlling decisions?

1

as -- my first reaction was both of those cases held that

2

the reason a person couldn't enjoin an unconstitutional

3

tax in Georgia is because there's a perfectly good remedy

4

for him to get a refund later.
And just to be sort of absolutely definite about

5
6

it, one of them quoted the Governor, who sent a message

7

when he passed this refund statute, and the Governor said,

8

I'm sending you over this statute to pass because certain

9

taxes have been paid into the State Treasury under laws

10

that have been declared unconstitutional, and so I'm

11

passing this statute so that you'll have a remedy.
So it wasn't as if they came into court with an

open question.

MR. CALVERT:

Yes, Your Honor.

I believe that

19

the first question concerned the Henderson and the Wright

20

v. Forrester cases, and also the legislative history, or

21

the statement of the Governors that is quoted in the

22

Wright case.

23

What is clear, Your Honor, is that

24

notwithstanding what the Governor had hoped to achieve by

25

way of enacting the refund statute, the language that

1

was -- what the General Assembly did in enacting the

2

refund statute did not have fully that effect.

3

He had certain specific taxes in mind, and in a

4

subsequent case -- I believe it was Eibel v. Forrester --

5

the Georgia supreme court said that the legislature had

6

not made the statute retroactive to the tax periods in

7

question, so the particular taxpayers he had hoped to

8

benefit were not benefited.

9

We submit that there's nothing, other than the

10

mere statement from the Governor that's cited in that

11

case, to suggest that the language that the General

12

Assembly actually used was intended to have scope broad

3

enough to encompass unconstitutional taxes.

4

The Court's second question --

QUESTION:

MR. CALVERT:

QUESTION:

I haven't asked.
If you could repeat it, please.

Well, suppose that we think they've

8

been getting what you might call colloquially the run­

9

around.

I gather that if the State has money that belongs

20

to them under the substantive constitutional law, they

21

would like to get it back.

you have no refund statute which happened to limit refunds

to 3 years, is there now no limitation?

I think, Your Honor, the argument

19

that the tax -- that the petitioner in this case has made

20

is that if we lose on the adequacy of our predeprivation

21

procedures, that we are obligated to refund these amounts,

22

and that all other taxpayers, regardless of any statute of

23

limitations, are open.

24
25

Now, the Georgia -- the basic Georgia tax scheme
was in effect since the 1940's.

argument someone would try to assert refunds back to the

2

1940's, assuming they're still here to make those claims.

3
4
5

QUESTION:

I thought it was conceded in this

case that you could go back only to 1985.
MR. CALVERT:

It is in this case, Your Honor,

6

but there are other cases pending in Georgia where that

7

limitation is not being applied, where the petitioners are

8

seeking to collect taxes back beyond 3 years.

9

But I think the question, Your Honor, concerning

10

sovereign immunity, we've asserted that even if -- even if

11

Georgia's predeprivation remedies are found to be

12

constitutionally insufficient, that that raises the

13

question regarding whether a State can be sued in its own

14

courts for monetary -- retroactive monetary relief

15

notwithstanding sovereign immunity, and I submit that

16

that's a question that is very much left open by the

17

McKesson case.

18

In McKesson, the taxpayer had filed an action

19

under Florida's repayment of funds statute, and the Court

20

was careful to note in its opinion that, under the

21

particular facts of that case, there was a Federal due

22

process obligation for the payment of relief, or backward­

23

looking relief pursuant to that particular State's post

24

deprivation procedure.

25

note that there was the waiver of sovereign immunity.

So the Court was very careful to

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260

1

The Court has indicated in numerous cases that

2

absent a waiver of its sovereign immunity the States

3

generally can't be sued in any court by any person on any

4

cause of action, and we submit that that --

5

QUESTION:

What would be left of the essential

6

holding of McKesson, then, that the State must provide an

7

adequate remedy, if we can say, well, we'll elect to rely

8

on our sovereign immunity?

9

the whole doctrine be gone?

10

MR. CALVERT:

Wouldn't the whole point of

Well, I think, Your Honor, that

11

what -- if I understand the question, or what the concern

12

is, is that you could have a constitutional violation with

13

no effective remedy.

14

We submit that the various immunities and

15

similar doctrines that have been recognized by this Court

16

generally demonstrate that there can be many circumstances

17

where, because of qualified immunity, or absolute

18

immunity, or the bar of the Eleventh Amendment, that

19

retroactive monetary relief may be unavailable, and we

20

submit that this is just such a situation.

21

QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that in a whole

22

line of cases, including the Brandeis decision in Iowa-

23

Des Moines National Bank v. Bennett, that there was an

24

initial step that was just skipped over?

25

say in that case taxpayer complaints about unequal

either give him a refund or tax his neighbor, but the

3

State's got to do one or the other?

6

Or not because he was -- did he just overlook
the threshold question of sovereign immunity?
MR. CALVERT:

As far as I can tell from the

7

reading of those cases, Your Honor, sovereign immunity did

8

not come up as a direct issue, and again, I believe that

9

the Court has indicated in the McKesson case, in my

10

reading of the oral arguments in that case, a concern that

11

sovereign immunity is very much an issue in the context of

12

a situation like this.
