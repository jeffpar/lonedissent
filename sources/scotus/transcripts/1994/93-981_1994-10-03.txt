ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD H. SEAMON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SEAMON:

9

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case concerns the Federal drug conspiracy

10
11

statute which is codified as section 846, title 21 of the

12

U.S. Code.

13

Respondent was indicted by a Federal grand jury

14

in the District of Alaska on one count of violating

15

section 846 by conspiring to distribute cocaine in Alaska.

16

The indictment did not allege that respondent or any of

17

his coconspirators committed any overt act in furtherance

18

of the conspiracy.

19

Respondent moved to dismiss the indictment on

20

the ground that the Government is required, in a

21

prosecution under 846, to allege and prove an overt act in

22

furtherance of the conspiracy.

23

that motion, and subsequently, at the close of the

24

evidence at trial, the court denied respondent's request

25

to instruct the jury that the Government was required to

prove an overt act.
The jury found respondent guilty, but the Ninth

2

3

Circuit reversed his conviction.

4

Government is required by section 846 to prove that an

5

overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy was committed.

6

That holding conflicts with the holdings of all eleven

7

other regional courts of appeals.
The Government brought the case here on a writ

of certiorari.

The question presented is whether section

10

846 requires proof of an overt act in furtherance of the

11

conspiracy.
In our view, the answer to that question is no,

12

13

section 846 does not require such proof, for three

14

reasons.

15

expressly require proof of an overt act in furtherance of

16

the conspiracy, and in contrast, many other Federal

17

conspiracy statutes, including the general conspiracy

18

statute, do expressly require such proof.

19

many Federal statutes that set forth the requirement

20

expressly, section 846 cannot be construed to impose the

21

requirement by implication.

decision
QUESTION:

Mr. Seamon, in the Felix case, I

3

guess Justice Stevens in his separate concurrence argued

4

that the overt acts didn't establish an essential element

5

of the conspiracy, and the majority opinion did not seem

6

to accept that view as expressed by Justice Stevens.

7

that something we're going to have to explain if we agree

8

with you on this interpretation?

9

MR. SEAMON:

No, Justice O'Connor.

Is

The majority

10

opinion in Felix simply didn't address this question of

11

statutory interpretation presented here.

12

Double Jeopardy case, and both courts agreed in this Court

13

that section 846 doesn't require proof of an overt act,

14

and the case was litigated in this Court on that

15

assumption.

16

Felix was a

Furthermore, the court of appeals in Felix, even

17

though it decided the Double Jeopardy issue against us,

18

also recognized that section 846 doesn't require proof of

19

an overt act, therefore the majority's opinion in Felix

20

was directed at explaining why, although a broad reading

21

of Grady might have barred the prosecution, it was

22

rejecting that broad reading.

23

The decisions of this Court that do control here

24

are Nash and Singer.

require proof of an overt act, but they apply a rule of

2

statutory interpretation that fully applies here.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Seamon, this was an avoidable

4

controversy, was it not, because the overt acts were

5

proved, but the prosecutor insisted that the charge not

6

include that specification?

7

requirement in a case such as this is not difficult to

8

show, it was in fact shown, and yet the prosecutor

9

resisted the charge?

10

MR. SEAMON:

In other words, the overt act

It is correct that overt acts were

11

proven in this case, and that as a general matter they

12

won't be difficult to prove in a conspiracy case.

13

In the -- the prosecutor examined the state of

14

the law and concluded that proof of an overt act wasn't an

15

essential element of the crime and therefore didn't have

16

to be alleged in the indictment.

17

was actually the district court that first raised the

18

question of whether an overt act needed to be alleged, and

19

it determined that one didn't need to be.

20

district court submitted the case to the jury without

21

instructing it that it was required to prove an overt act.

QUESTION:

this controversy by allowing the charge to be made?

He could have

done so, and he chose not to, because after studying the

QUESTION:

MR. SEAMON:

8

brought the charge.

QUESTION:

She tried the case, and it was he who

was an essential element, she could not have amended the

12

indictment at that point.

13

MR. SEAMON:

I mean, she, if an overt act

That's right.

If the district

14

court had concluded that an overt act was an essential

15

element, the Government would have had to reindict, so it

wasn't quite as simple a matter as simply amending the

indictment, and in - -

QUESTION:

Mr. Seamon, is it necessary to prove

an overt act to establish venue in a particular district

QUESTION:

MR. SEAMON:

venue, and the question here --

QUESTION:

Normally does, yes
-- allege something to establish

Couldn't the formation of the

8

conspiracy establish the venue, that the conspirators

9

convened at a particular place?

10

MR. SEAMON:

11

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice Scalia.
And that wouldn't be an overt act in

12

furtherance of the conspiracy in the normal meaning of

13

that term, would it?

14

MR. SEAMON:

That's correct.

Venue can be

15

established either by the commission of an overt act in

16

the district where the prosecution is brought, or the

17

formation of the conspiracy in that district.

18

The question here really doesn't have to do so

19

much with whether the prosecutor could have alleged and

20

proven an overt act, because overt acts were proven, but

21

the question is whether conduct that Congress has made a

22

crime can be punished in the Ninth Circuit, as it can be

23

in every other circuit of the country.

considers to be valid convictions because of the Ninth

Circuit's erroneous view of the law.
QUESTION:

2

Or maybe you could put it, maybe,

3

that it should not be punished in all the other circuits

4

in the country, just as it is not in the Ninth.

5

that's just as much the question before us, isn't it?
MR. SEAMON:

6

7

I mean,

I'm sure that's the way our

opponent would phrase the question.

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. SEAMON:

The -- and our primary argument is

10

based on the text of section 846, which -- and Congress'

11

intent in enacting that statute.
The text of section 846 is set out in relevant

12

13

part on page 9 of our opening brief on the merits, and

14

page 9 also sets out the general conspiracy statute with

15

which it is useful to compare section 846.

16

at the top of page 9.

17

of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.

18

punishes "any person who conspires to commit any offense"

19

defined in the subchapter proscribing various drug

20

offenses.

21

Section 846 is

It does not expressly require proof
It

In contrast, the general conspiracy statute,

22

which is at the bottom of page 9 of our brief, does

23

expressly require proof of an overt act.

It makes it

1

and do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy."
That language in the general conspiracy statute,

2

3

referring to an act to effect the object of the

4

conspiracy, shows that Congress understood that an act in

5

furtherance of the conspiracy is separate and distinct

6

from the conspiracy itself.

7

conspiracy statute, the overt act requirement is not

8

implicit in the term "conspires."

9

separate language that specifically refers to the act.

10

The term "conspires" is also used in section

Thus, under the general

It is spelled out in

11

846, and there, too, the term should not be construed to

12

contain an overt act by implication.

13

would be especially unjustified in light of the fact that

14

there are other Federal conspiracy statutes in which

15

Congress used express language to require proof of an

16

overt act.

17

Such a construction

The construction of section 846 that we're

18

urging also is compelled, I think, by the Court's

19

decisions in Nash and Singer.

20

the defendant was charged with a conspiracy under an

21

indictment that did not allege any overt act in

22

furtherance of the conspiracy.

23

In both Nash and Singer,

In both cases, the defendant argued in this

24

Court that the indictment was defective because of its

25

failure to allege an overt act and, in each case, this

1

Court rejected the argument because the statute under

2

which the defendant was charged did not expressly require

3

proof of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.
The Court explained that because the statute was

4
5

silent as to overt acts, it punished conspiracies "on the

6

common law footing," which is to say, without requiring

7

proof of an overt act.
Nash and Singer provide guidance here in two

8

9

ways.

They give guidance to the court in interpreting

10

conspiracy statutes that are silent as to overt acts, and

11

they give guidance to Congress by providing a blueprint

12

for it to follow when drafting a conspiracy statute,

13

because they make it clear that if Congress wants to

14

require proof of an overt act in furtherance of the

15

conspiracy, it has to say so expressly.

16

the statute will be construed not to require such proof.

If it does not,

And it's reasonable to assume that Congress

17
18

followed the blueprint laid out in Nash and Singer,

19

because Nash and Singer were on the book when Congress

20

enacted the earliest drug conspiracy statute and when it

21

enacted section 846, and their validity has never been

22

called into question by this Court.
Nash and Singer support our position in another

23
24

way.

25

applies here.

They apply the rule of statutory interpretation that

1

common law term, the Court presumes, in the absence of

2

evidence to the contrary, that Congress intended the term

3

to have its common law meaning.

4

At common law, as the Court said in Nash and

5

Singer, proof of an overt act in furtherance of the

6

conspiracy was not necessary to establish the conspiracy,

7

and there is no evidence that Congress intended to depart

8

from the common law in punishing drug conspiracies.

9

Now, respondent questions whether Nash and

10

Singer understood the common law of conspiracy correctly,

11

but in a sense, the question is beside the point.

12

point is that Nash and Singer were on the books when

13

Congress enacted the Federal drug conspiracy statutes, and

14

their understanding of the common law had not been called

15

into question up to that point, or for that matter at any

16

point later, for example, when Congress enacted section

17

846 in 1970.

18

The

Thus, Nash and Singer furnish the background

19

rule for Congress in drafting the conspiracy statutes, and

20

they should also apply the background rule for

21

interpreting the statute.

22

Respondent's other argument is that Nash and

23

Singer represented, to use his term, an ill-advised

24

expansion of conspiracy law, but Nash and Singer didn't

25

break any new ground.

Each began with the recognition

1

that at common law it was not necessary to prove an overt

2

act, and that principle had been recognized by this Court

3

as early as 1879 in United States v. Hirsch, and it was

4

reaffirmed in a decision that was issued just a few months

5

before Congress enacted the first Federal drug conspiracy

6

statute.

7

Based on their understanding of the common law,

8

Nash and Singer applied the rule of statutory

9

interpretation concerning Congress' use of a common law

10

term.

11

earlier and later decisions.

12

never disavowed Nash or Singer or the principles

13

underlying them, and so respondent cannot bear his burden

14

of explaining why the Court should not follow Nash and

15

Singer in this case.

That rule, likewise, had been applied in many

Both parties agree that in this case it cannot

2

be settled by simple reference to the text of the statute

3

without reference to any other historical statutory or

precedential source, and the reason for that is that it

contains the term conspire, and conspiracy.

If Congress had said -- instead of using the

term conspire had used the word agree, if you agree to

MR. RIORDAN:

Ah --

If we do that, you lose.
No, we don't, Your Honor, and

here's why, because again, in the sources that we've

13

cited, the Pollack article, the Sayre article, the Harno

14

article, the definitive studies of the common law, there's

15

a consensus that over 800 years of English history, and it

16

hardly should come as a surprise, that conspiracy meant

17

different things at different times.

18

What the Government has done is said that the

1

term, the meaning of the common law definition of

20

conspiracy, is fixed by the 1611 Poulterers' case, and the

21

Poulterers' case was not even before a common law court,

22

it was before the Star Chamber, which was not -- I'm no

legal historian, but it was not a common law court, it was

a prerogative court, a court of the king.

for a common law definition, if that's what it was going

celestial magnetic resonance imaging machine that could

produce a graph of what Congress was thinking in 1 70 when

it passed this statute, I'd suggest we'd find that it

wasn't thinking about the issue of an overt act --

QUESTION:

That counts for the other side.

MR. RIORDAN:

But that was hardly the only

definition of conspiracy given at common law, but more

4

importantly, what the Government is saying is that when

5

Congress didn't speak to this question at all, the overt

act being in or out, it must have been thinking about the

7

common law, and it must have been thinking about those

8

precedents, Nash and Singer, which suggest that if you

don't say anything about an overt act, then you're getting

10

the common law definition.
But in 1970, there were also 100 years of

decisions from this Court --

QUESTION:

If you go back to your first

14

argument, the text of the statute, and you say that 846

was not an attempt to define the word conspiracy, that

16

might be more persuasive if 371, the general conspiracy

17

statute, had read, if two or more persons agree, but it

18

doesn't.

19

It reads, if two or more persons conspire, and

12

What reason is there to think that

13

Congress thought about it in 1867 and put in the overt

14

act, but didn't think about it in 1970?

15

MR. RIORDAN:

Because according to the cases

16

that have interpreted 371 from this Court, the Court said

17

that in 1867 when they were writing a general Federal

18

conspiracy statute for the first time, they made a

conscious decision to reject the common law model, so we

know that's why they did it.

in order to give a conspiracy statute that effect?

other words, there's not enough to leave out, as 371 has

MR. RIORDAN:

If it doesn't want an overt act,

there's doubt in some quarters of whether that's a

reliable source, but it would be more helpful to either

side if it were there rather than complete silence.
Or, Your Honor, if the precedent of this Court,

12

13

its decisions concerning conspiracy, were uniform as to

14

what the terms meant, it would be something else.
On the one hand, we have 100 years of this

act requirement, but saying why that's a very good thing.

which say otherwise with respect to different kinds of

22

MR. RIORDAN:

They're a very thin read, Your

23

Honor, for this reason.

In Nash, Nash dealt with a

24

Sherman antitrust conspiracy statute, which is outside the

25

purview of normal criminal law.

In Nash, it does contain

1

the statute that, absent an overt act requirement, we look

2

to the common law, but interestingly enough, the rest of

3

the Nash opinion says, reverses the conviction there,

4

because the Government failed to prove an act.

5

That is, in the antitrust context, the

6

Government alleged the specific means by which trade was

7

obstructed, and the Court found that the obstructions in

8

that case were such that they permitted the jury to

9

convict without finding that the means was proven, and the

10

Supreme Court said, given what it says in the Sherman act,

11

we don't have any reason to go further.

12

Well, the Sherman act, as pled and proved in

13

that case, required action, so it wasn't a case where Nash

14

was saying, we're now going to have a conspiracy statute

15

which does require the Government to plead and prove

16

actions, because they did in the Nash case.

17

QUESTION:

But they did say in the Nash case

18

that an overt act was not required to support a conspiracy

19

conviction under the Sherman Act, did they not?

20

MR. RIORDAN:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. RIORDAN:

They most assuredly did.

Why, then, is it a thin read?
Well, because we're dealing not

with an antitrust statute or a selective service statute,

we're dealing with a statute that's traditionally in the

criminal area.

14

order to enforce the Federal drug laws which already are

15

far broader than the actual ambit that they're going to

focus on, that Congress needed to eliminate from drug

conspiracies the overt act requirement, which is satisfied

18

by the most minimal, by the most minimal action, it

doesn't even need to be an illegal action, I would suggest

cutting up against the cases of this Court such as Yates,

they're going to be punished if they take even the

slimmest overt act step forward.

3

Secondly, to allow them to form a joint mental

state but do nothing about it, terminate that evil

thinking before they go forward, and to provide, to assure

society that this action has gone forward in some way

7

which begins to threaten its societal interest.

8

9

Those are all very, very good objectives of the
overt act requirement, and they, this Court has found them

10

desirable in the context of 371.

11

there's as much reason to believe that Congress read those

12

opinions about the function of the overt act requirement

as there is to believe that it read Nash and Singer, which

are Sherman, you know, a Sherman antitrust case, or the

whether there's an element of an overt act in this

Are you taking the position that even

when the statute on its face requires an overt act, the

it's enough that they prove it?

6

MR. RIORDAN:

I don't know the answer to that

it would depend how it were written, but it is possible

that if there were explicit statutory requirements it

it's never been my impression that there's a statutory

requirement that all elements of the offense have to be

MR. RIORDAN:

It's a very good thing that the

answer to that question isn't critical to the Court's

decision of this case, because I will confess that I don't

know the answer, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

I'm glad you clarified your position,

because I thought you were disagreeing with the Ninth

Circuit to the extent that they didn't require the act to

be alleged, but you think the Ninth Circuit is right in

15

its middle view?

MR. RIORDAN:

I want to make absolutely clear

that the issue of whether the Ninth Circuit was right in

taking no position on it.

I am certainly not saying that the Ninth Circuit

23

in any way incorrect.

position that the Ninth Circuit has taken, correctly, we

believe, in contraposition to Eleventh Circuit's.

3

I prepared for the argument today by watching

Henry Fonda, who argued against 11 in Twelve Angry Men.

5

We acknowledge that other circuits have gone the other way

on this question, but I would submit to the Court that I

7

have seen nothing in those decisions that has focused on

8

the fact that 846 is not a conspiracy statute, it deals

9

with more than one offense, and that its primary function

10

is to set penalty rather than to define the offenses, and

11

that's a fact that those opinions simply haven't contended

12

with, and we think it's absolutely critical to the correct

decision of this case.

QUESTION:

If we found a statute that said,

Even if -Are you explaining now why you think

846 is different from 371?
MR. RIORDAN:

Yes, I am, Your Honor. I am, in

10

the sense that 371 deals with the crime of conspiracy, and

11

conspiracy alone, and 846 deals with more than one

12

offense, and --

13

QUESTION:

Why does that make any difference?

14

MR. RIORDAN:

Well, I suggest that since we know

15

from the case precedent that Congress -- the courts have

16

uniformly declared that Congress wasn't focusing on the

17

elements of attempt, I think it's fair to infer in this

18

very statute that they weren't focusing on the elements of

19

conspiracy.

22

QUESTION:

Well, and what makes you think they

were focusing on the elements of conspiracy in 371?
MR. RIORDAN:

Well, the legislative -- the

courts' interpretations of that seems to be that since

this was the first general conspiracy statute in 871, they

were focused on the fact that they wanted to create a

statute that had an overt act requirement that didn't

2

exist at the Star Chamber and at English common law, and

3

we would suggest that, 100 years later, there may well

4

have been Congressmen thinking the overt act requirement

5

had worked its way into the warp and woof of the

6

definition of conspiracy in this country, that that's the

7

American definition of conspiracy.

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Riordan, what Federal criminal

statutes do define crime?

My impression is, all of them

10

just say whoever commits this shall be punished by that.

11

I mean, this is not an unusual statute in that it, as you

12

say, it does not define the crime.

13

read like this, don't they?

14

MR. RIORDAN:

15

QUESTION:

17

Most Federal statutes

Well, I --

They use a common law term and say,

the punishment shall be thus, or a common sensical term.
MR. RIORDAN:

I'm sure that's true, Your Honor,

18

but in Joyce and Monduhano, the Federal court said, look,

19

we don't get any guidance on what the term means from the

20

statute itself, and all we're saying is, we think the same

21

is true of the conspiracy end of the statute, and that the

22

courts have to look elsewhere to figure out what the heck

23

this means, and we think that one reasonable

24

interpretation is that Congress thought that when it uses

25

conspiracy and conspire, it was referring to the kind of

QUESTION:

I do have a question, actually.

What

20

do you say in response to Mr. Riordan's argument?

21

is, I take his argument basically to be that by the time

22

this particular statute was passed, 846, by that time in

23

1970 it had become fairly widely accepted practice that,

24

in the Federal law, conspiracy included overt acts.

criminal provisions that aren't even printed in what we

2

think of as the criminal section of the U.S. Code, 18, 21,

3

26, et cetera, but rather, sort of outliers, the Sherman

4

Act, which isn't in the West Publishing thing, the

5

Selective Service Act, and so by that time anyone who was

6

a drafter would have thought, of course it includes an

7

overt act when we use that word conspiracy.
Indeed, this particular statute doesn't define a

8

9

crime.

It seems to refer back to 371.

It just says,

10

those who commit this kind of offense shall have the same

11

penalties, et cetera, and so at least the matter is

12

ambiguous.

13

wide for any other normal criminal section with conspiracy

14

if it didn't include overt act.

15

After all, a drafter would have looked far and

I mean, that's, I think that's his argument, so-

that's at least a good enough argument to invoke the Rule
