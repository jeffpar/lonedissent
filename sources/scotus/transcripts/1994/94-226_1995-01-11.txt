ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY SCOTT RICHARD

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. RICHARD:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This case arose out of the adoption by the

12

Florida supreme court of a rule which prohibited attorneys

13

from engaging in direct mail solicitation to victims of

14

accidents or their survivors for a period of 30 days after

15

the accident.

16

The district court declared that the rule was

17

unconstitutional, and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.

18

an unusual postscript to its opinion, the Eleventh Circuit

19

stated that it was disturbed that it was required by this

20

Court's earlier decision in Bates and its progeny to reach

21

that result.

In

22

The concern that was expressed by the Eleventh

23

Circuit reflected similar concerns expressed by at least

24

seven justices in full or partial dissents in Bates and

25

the cases following Bates.

Bates itself was a limited decision by its own

characterization.

4

Court later in Ohralik referred to as restrained

5

advertising of the rates for routine legal services and

6

nothing more.

It held only that a State could not

7

A year later, in Ohralik, this Court stated that

8

the States had a critical interest in maintaining the high

9

standards of professionalism in connection with attorney

10

advertising, and in fact it permitted States to prohibit

11

altogether an attorney from engaging in direct, person-

12

to-person solicitation of any nature.

13
14

QUESTION:

Does Florida permit lawyers to

solicit business in person?

15

MR. RICHARD:

16

In doing so, this Court in Ohralik noted that an

No, ma'am, it does not.

17

attorney's interest in his or her remunerative employment

18

was charged with only marginal First Amendment concerns,

19

and that regulation of that type of advertising falls

20

within the State's proper sphere of economic and

21

professional regulation.

22

In Ohralik, the Court noted a significant

23

distinction between the restrained advertising that the

24

Court had permitted in Bates and what it referred to in an

25

earlier case of Railroad Trainmen v. West Virginia as

ambulance chasing.

2

did not involve ambulance chasing.

3

The case this Court stated in Ohralik

Ten years later, however, in Zauderer and

4

Shapero, the Court prohibited the States from regulating

5

what in essence amounted to ambulance chasing.

6

Zauderer, the Court held that States could not prohibit

7

direct solicitation of clients based upon a particular

8

legal problem, and in Shapero, the Court took another

9

giant step forward when it held that States could not

In

10

regulate the direct, targeted solicitation of particular

11

individuals who had suffered or were about to suffer a

12

particular legal problem.

13
14
15

QUESTION:
that of Shapero?

How do you distinguish this case from

It seems pretty close.

MR. RICHARD:

Justice O'Connor, I believe that

16

this case can be distinguished from Shapero on the basis

17

of the fact that it is a reasonable time, place, or manner

18

restriction.

19
20

QUESTION:

Well, doesn't a time, place, and

manner restriction have to be content-neutral?

21

MR. RICHARD:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. RICHARD:

It does, and we believe that --

How is this content-neutral?
Well, we believe it is content-

24

neutral within the scope of what this Court has

25

interpreted as content-neutral.

What it said in Clark v.

Community for Creative Nonviolence, and in Ward v. Rock

2

Against Racism, and in Renton v. Playtime Theatres is that

3

the issue, the principal inquiry in determining content

4

neutrality, and I'm quoting from Ward, is whether the

5

Government's purpose in control -- is the controlling

6

consideration.

7
8

Government regulation of expressive activity is
content-neutral, the Court said, so long as it is
justified without reference to the content of the

10

regulated speech.
QUESTION:

11

But doesn't this regulation address

12

only certain types of speech, and it's there with

13

reference to a particular kind of speech?

14
15

MR. RICHARD:

Yes, Justice Connor, it does, but

this Court has never - -

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. RICHARD:

0'Connor.
-- has never said that simply

18

because you must make reference to the content in order to

1

determine whether or not it falls within the scope of the

20

regulation, that it therefore violates the content-neutral

21

rule.

22

23

QUESTION:

Yes, but you justify this regulation

by what the communication says.

MR. RICHARD:

MR. RICHARD:

QUESTION:

Here, you do justify the regulation

in terms of the content of the communication.

MR. RICHARD:

QUESTION:

9

That's the

Well, Just --

Now, you might -- you might still

prevail, but it's not content -neutral.
MR. RICHARD:

Well, Justice Kennedy, I would

10

suggest that it's justified by the nature of the person to

11

whom the communication is sent, the circumstances of that

12

individual.

13

In Renton, clearly it's necessary to make

14

reference to the nature of the film to determine whether

15

or not it contains adult situations, which is what the

16

Renton ordinance provided, that you had to - - you could

17

prohibit it within certain zoned areas.

18

You must, therefore, make reference to the

19

content of the film to determine whether or not it's

20

subject to the regulation, but what this Court said was

21

that that wasn't the controlling factor if the purpose of

22

it was not to control the content but rather to control

23

the secondary effects of it.

24
25

It said the same thing essentially in Ward, that
you have to look at whether or not reference to the

content was for the purpose of controlling the content.

2

Here the content is permitted - -

3

QUESTION:

But do you think the effect on the

4

person to whom the message is addressed is a secondary

5

effect within the meaning of Renton?

6

MR. RICHARD:

Well, that -- that is, Your Honor,

7

if you're talking about the effect upon that individual.

8

If you're talking about the -QUESTION:

10

In Renton, you're not talking about

the people who wanted to go to these theaters.

11

MR. RICHARD:

12

QUESTION:

13

15
16

Well, you are --

You're talking about what it did to

the neighborhood.
MR. RICHARD:

You're talking about the effect

upon the community and the surrounding area.
QUESTION:

Not the audience or the message.

17

Whereas here, you're talking about the effect of the

18

message on the people who receive it.

1

MR. RICHARD:

What we're suggesting, Your Honor,

20

is that the State has the right to determine that it has a

21

secondary effect upon the legal profession as a whole and,

22

in turn, the administration of justice, and that the

23

ability of the State to make that judgment has been

24

entirely removed by this Court's prior opinions.

25

QUESTION:

What the State is saying, then, is

1

that a certain number of lawyers will chase ambulances if

2

we don't prohibit them, and it's going to make the whole

3

bar look bad if they find out that these people are

4

chasing ambulances, therefore we'll prohibit it.

5

sounds like an odd justification.
MR. RICHARD:

6

That

What we're talking about, Justice

7

Rehnquist, is the extent to which we are going to permit

8

the States to make these judgments, as opposed to the

9

extent to which the Federal courts are going to

10

micromanage the question of attorney advertising, and

11

what's happened here is that as a matter of law,

12

essentially this Court has said that the question of

13

whether or not a given type of attorney advertising will

14

have an adverse effect upon the view of the public as to

15

lawyers and the institutions that they serve is beyond the

16

scope of State consideration.

17

QUESTION:

Well, but is it really a terribly

18

legitimate State goal to say, we want to protect not the

19

substance of the reputation of the legal profession but

20

the appearance of the reputation?

Court in Ohralik, where they mentioned precisely what Your

Honor is saying with regard to the possibility of

adjusters contacting individuals.

4

What the Court said in Ohralik, which I think is

5

accurate, implicitly what they said was, that's not a

constitutional question.

11

Did Ohralik say only personal injury

12

lawyers can't have face-to-face contact, or was this all

MR. RICHARD:

That is what the rule says, but

15

this Court has said time and time again -- well, it

16

doesn't define the lawyer.

17

18

30 days after a personal injury.

But this Court has said time and time again that

the State may deal with these issues on a step-to-step

basis as it sees a need for it, and that that's not a

1

ought to go back at some point and look at that question

2

as to whether or not it should be expanded, but the

3

constitutional issue before this Court is whether the

4

State can deal with this as to anyone.

5

QUESTION:

Does the State bar regard this

Court's decision in Edenfield v. Fane as a guiding light

7

in this area?

8

on everything since Bates, so I would like to know in

9

particular, since that has been an important decision in

You seem to be making a grand scale attack

10

this line of commercial advertising lawyer solicitation

11

cases, Edenfield v. Fane, do you regard that as a

12

precedent that you have no quarrel with?

13

MR. RICHARD:

The Edenfield case was a case of

14

limited application, and we do not have a problem with

15

Edenfield.

16

question, because we believe that the essential problem

17

here was created in Zauderer and in Shapero, and not

18

solely because this -- and that goes well beyond the

19

question of whether this is a time, place, or manner

20

restriction.

We believe -- and I'm glad you asked the

21

We believe that the decisions that were made in

22

Zauderer and Shapero were blatantly inconsistent with two

23

other lines of cases that this Court had been deciding

24

simultaneously.

25

solicitation, commercial advertising generally, and the

One of them was the cases on commercial

1

other was what we have referred to in our brief as the

2

institutional speech cases.

3

What this Court said in Central Hudson v. Public

4

Service Commission and in Board of Trustees v. Fox is that

5

the States are entitled to considerable deference in

6

determining where to draw the line on commercial

7

advertising, and when it begins to be too much to meet the

8

requirements of the First Amendment.

9

In Board of Trustees v. Fox, in addition to

10

saying that there is no least restrictive means test, the

11

Court said this:

12

guess the Government's judgment regarding where to draw

13

the line.

14

establishing with precision the point at which

15

restrictions become more extensive than their objective

16

requires, and provide the legislative and executive

17

branches needed leeway in a field, commercial speech,

18

traditionally subject to Government regulation.

19

it said, we have been loath to second-

We take into account the difficulty of

Well, at the same time the Court was saying

20

that, it was saying with respect to lawyers -- and this is

21

just commercial solicitation, which in Ohralik the Court

22

said was only marginally charged with First Amendment

23

protection.

24

essentially, in Zauderer and Shapero, gave the courts --

25

gave the States no leeway --no leeway to deal with this.

At the same time it said that, it

1

It basically said, you don't have a substantial enough

2

interest to consider it.

3

In fact, in Shapero, in part 3 of Shapero, which

4

represented the views of only four justices but

5

nevertheless was part of the opinion of the Court, it said

6

you couldn't even deal with the format of the letter.

7

couldn't even deal with the letter that was essentially a

8

used-car type of an advertisement that said to an

9

individual, free legal services, that made subjective

10

You

predictions of success, that said, call me now.

11

Now, In Ohralik, this Court said that the State

12

had a substantial interest in avoiding the potential that

13

a lawyer, because of the lawyer's training and experience,

14

could be overbearing with an individual, and yet, in

15

Shapero, in part 3 of Shapero, it essentially said, you

16

can use any type of enticement to get that individual to

17

call you, and then you're basically free.

18

QUESTION:

So suppose that in Florida -- I

19

can -- suppose there's been a bad accident, and it

20

involves a man or a woman who knows nothing about law, so

21

obviously they're terribly upset, and I can understand why

22

you might want to keep lawyers away from them for 30 days.

23

But suppose that man or that woman, who's

24

terribly upset and doesn't have much money and knows

25

nothing about law, would like to find a lawyer.

MR. RICHARD:

1

You call the bar and they make

2

available to you from a list of lawyers those who have

3

indicated that they handle that type of work.

4

addition, Florida recognizes both designation of fields

5

and specialization as certification, so there are a

6

list -- lawyers are listed in the yellow pages by

7

designation of a field or by certi -- the fact that

a

they've been certified to handle a particular field.
My understanding is that most States now permit

9
10

lawyers to list in the yellow pages with designations.

MR. RICHARD:

1

or encourage letters to accident victims within the first

2

30 days of the accident?

3

MR. RICHARD:

The bar takes no position as to

4

that, because it believes it is not permitted to as a

5

result of this Court's decisions.

6

QUESTION:

Did the bar association -- I'm

7

talking about the bar association, not individual lawyers.

8

Does the bar association affirmatively make an effort to

9

make known to the accident victims that they have this

10
11

referral service available?
MR. RICHARD:

Oh, yes, sir, and as a matter of

12

fact it has publications that it attempts to widely

13

The one other remark that you made that I would

like to respectfully comment on was that the substantial

State interest that we were suggesting here was that

lawyers be able to protect their reputations, which is

what the respondent wishes to suggest is the substantial

State interest, and I think that trivializes what we are

really suggesting here.

We are not saying that lawyers should be able to

20

protect their reputations, but what we are saying is that

21

we learned several hundred years ago that the manner in

22

which we treat our fundamental institutions, that the

dignity which we grant to those institutions, has a great

deal to do with the respect the public has in them and

their credibility as institutions.

which the Florida bar and the Florida supreme court

essentially a problem of the social question of how we

problem by the Federal courts, and in particular this

Court, decreeing that it is beyond the power of the State

to consider the strictly commercial implications of

certain types of attorney advertising.

10

Because what's happened here is, it has been

raised to a constitutional level, and what has been

imposed upon the States in reality is a least restrictive

The letters at issue in this case are highly-

2

regulated by the Florida Bar.

At page 12-A of the

3

appendix to our brief, we set forth the extensive

4

regulations about these letters -- what they must contain,

5

what they must say, the fact that the envelope and each

6

page must be stamped "Advertisement."

7

These are the least intrusive, the most discreet

8

forms of communication, and the question is whether or not

9

that mode of communication can be precluded by the Florida

10

Bar for a period of 30 days during the time, as then-

11

Chief Justice Shaw of the Florida supreme court said,

12

during the time when a person is most in need of the

13

information.

14

And yes, the question of underinclusiveness, as

15

Mr. Richard I think has now conceded, goes to whether or

16

not this regulation directly and materially advances

17

substantial State interests, and if one of those State

18

interests is this theoretical privacy right, then how is

19

that State interest directly and materially advanced by a

20

rule which precludes the lawyer from sending a letter

informing a person of his or her rights but allows the

insurance adjuster or the defense lawyer to communicate

with that person any time.

9

QUESTION:

10

I'm sorry, Mr. Justice Souter?

Justice Breyer -I'm certainly glad I never passed

through the stage of being a lawyer before --

(Laughter.)

12

QUESTION:

13

(Laughter.)

14

QUESTION:

It might have helped you, actually.

The -- what I wondered was this.

It

15

seemed to me they're -- a) I don't know if they're arguing

16

this as their strongest justification, but it did make an

17

impression upon me that a man or a woman who has just

18

suffered a serious accident, maybe has lost a husband or a

19

wife, is not a model of a rational consumer, and so what

20

they're saying is, protect that person for 30 days both

21

from harassment and so that when a choice of lawyer is

22

made it's more rational.

23

You can tell them during that 30 days who's

24

available.

25

You could keep big lists of people.

You can refer them to the referral service.
You could keep all

the advertising material in one place and tell them, go

2

there, but for 30 days, leave them alone so that they have

3

a chance to make this decision more rationally.

4

Now, that I took it, at least to me, was a

5

fairly powerful justification.

6

MR. ROGOW:

Now, what's wrong with it?

Well, Justice Breyer, grief is not

7

the gravamen of this rule and, indeed, there are two other

8

portions of the rule that address that.

9

harassment, and the other says that if a person -- if a

One precludes

10

lawyer knows or should know that a person is not able to

11

make a principled decision, then that person should not be

12

contacted.

13

But remember, this rule applies to all

14

accidents, not just the grief - stricken situation, and I

15

think that people who are in grief need some information,

16

too.

17

discarded, and this Court has said that in both Bolger

18

Drugs and in Shapero, the suggestion that a letter which

19

can be discarded somehow intrudes upon that grief I think

20

stretches the notion of this mode of communication.

21

The suggestion that a letter, which can be

QUESTION:

Yes, but your opponent says it's not

22

one letter, it's a flood of letters, and as I understand

23

it you said there's nothing in the record, and I haven't

24

read this, but they do refer to a study that the bar made

25

that indicated that this was regarded as a problem of some

1

2

magnitude.
MR. ROGOW:

The study that the bar made was made

3

of 200 people in 1987 who apparently received direct mail

4

letters, and something like 11 percent, or 21, said that

5

they were offended by receiving the direct mail letters.

6

Now, that is not the kind of burden of proof that the bar

7

would have to carry under Ibanez or any of the First

8

Amendment cases dealing with this.

9

But even if some people are offended -- and I'm

10

sensitive to the good manners of respecting grief.

11

if they are --

12

QUESTION:

Even

Well, do you think your client is

13

sensitive to such matters?

14

but this -- now, who is it you're presently representing?

15

It's not a lawyer, it's some entity, as I understand --

16

MR. ROGOW:

Perhaps you are, Mr. Rogow,

It is a lawyer, Justice O'Connor.

17

John Blakely is a lawyer who sends direct mail

18

advertising, and he is a plaintiff in the case along with

19

Went For It, Inc., which is a referral service.

20
21

QUESTION:

Went For It, Inc., and do you

represent Went For It, Inc.?

22

MR. ROGOW:

23

QUESTION:

I do, and - And would you describe for us just

24

what it is that Went For It, Inc. does in Florida to

25

contact accident victims?

Does it study police reports

1

and get information about any incidents and then identify

2

the people and write letters?

3

MR. ROGOW:

It does not, Justice O'Connor,

4

because as a referral agency, all it can do is identify

5

people who may be in need of this information and then a

6

lawyer can obtain that information from the referral

7

service, but the referral service is bound by the same

8

rules as the lawyer is, and that's why Went For It, Inc.

9

is a plaintiff also in the case.
QUESTION:

10
11

about accidents and then --

12

MR. ROGOW:

13

QUESTION:

14

Yes, but I - - it gets information

Shares them with lawyers.
-- shares that with lawyers who send

letters to these victims.

15

MR. ROGOW:

Yes, Justice O'Connor, letters that

16

are highly regulated by the bar that must include a

17

statement of the lawyer's qualifications that are at the

18

same moment - -

19
20

QUESTION:

MR. ROGOW:

25

Police reports, accident reports,

which are matters of public record.

23
24

It looks at

police reports or something?

21
22

And what does it do?

QUESTION:

And presumably it also runs ads, does

it?
MR. ROGOW:

It does not.

It does not, no.

QUESTION:

1

2

Do the lawyers run some ads, do

you - -

3

MR. ROGOW:

Well, some lawyers may run

4

advertisements of different sorts, but whether or not they

5

run an advertisement of their availability is different

6

from running an advertisement saying, I am in the referral

business.

The service Went For It provides is

who pay them for that information --

Now, there isn't a form letter that the

Well, actually, there is, Justice

20

Ginsburg, although it's not in this record.

recently promulgated a handbook for lawyer advertising

22

which contains forms of suggested different kinds of

communications that would meet bar standards, but no, the

The bar has

QUESTION:

Could -- does the bar, or could it,

3

consistent with the First Amendment, require pre-screening

4

of letters, solicitation letters that are going to be sent

5

out within the first 30 days, or ever?

6

MR. ROGOW:

I don't think the bar could -- could

7

require pre-screening, and one of the problems is, is that

8

this delay in the access to information is inconsistent

9

with the notion that it is important for people to have

10

information quickly, and I think that the bar agrees, and

11

has stated in its brief, that it is important to

12

communicate to people the availability of legal services.

13
14
15
16

But there is no pre-screening, but there is a
contemporary submission.
QUESTION:

Not letter-by-letter, but the

attorney's own form letter.

17

MR. ROGOW:

18

these letters and look at them.

19

filing of each letter with the Florida Bar Advertising

20

Commission, I think it is, so a lawyer is obligated to

21

also send a copy of the letter after it's been out, and so

22

the bar would have an opportunity to review these letters,

23

but it would not be prior to the submission of these

24

letters, to the depositing of them in the mailbox.

25

I -- perhaps the bar could request

1

form the underpinnings of the decision below and have been

2

consistent.

3

has really offered no principled reason to retreat from

4

the line of cases, beginning with Virginia Board of

5

Pharmacy, running through Central Hudson, Bates, Zauderer,

6

RMJ, which are on the foundation that I have said, that

7

truthful, nonmisleading information conveyed in a mode,

8

and the mode the Court described in Shapero, the most

9

unobtrusive mode of communication, conveyed in a mode

There is no reason to retreat, and the bar

10

which the bar has now even taken a step beyond and

11

regulated and required that they be stamped with

12

"Advertisement," that these are threatening to any

13

substantial State interest.

14

Basically, the bar's argument is, is that that

15

line of cases from Central Hudson through Ibanez should be

16

discarded, or at least discarded as to lawyers, and that

17

Bates, RMJ, and Zauderer were wrongly decided, and that

18

really is the essence of what the bar is saying, and its

19

other suggestions - - the measure of an argument oftentimes

20

is how far one must stretch to make it, and when the bar

21

likens these lawyers' letters to sound trucks and

22

residential picketers, trying to draw strength from

23

residential privacy, from those kinds of analogies, I

24

think that demonstrates how far the bar must reach to try

25

to get around what the established jurisprudence is.

And when the bar says lawyers are like prisoners

1

2

and military personnel and schoolchildren and the

3

institutional speech cases should somehow or other be

4

applied to lawyers, I think that, too, demonstrates how

5

difficult the bar's case is, but it is -QUESTION:

6

7

What do you refer to as the

institutional speech cases, Mr. Rogow?

8

MR. ROGOW:

9

QUESTION:

Pardon me, Mr. Chief Justice?
You referred to the institutional

10

speech cases.

What cases are those?

11

exactly what you mean.
MR. ROGOW:

12

I'm not sure I know

Kuhlmeier, Hazelwood v. School

13

District, whether or not schoolchildren can publish

14

things, Goldman, the yarmulke case in the military,

15

situations in which there is custody and control in

16

employment and property interests at stake of the

17

Government.

18

I think those analogies just reach too far.

The bottom line in this case is whether

19

truthful, nonmisleading, carefully tailored information

20

regulated by the bar harms any substantial State interest.

21

The answer - QUESTION:

22

Do you think there's room for any

23

more regulation under the commercial speech doctrine for

24

people who are licensed by the State to carry out their

25

duties?

It isn't as though a lawyer is a totally free

1

agent.

The lawyer, presumably in Florida as in most

2

States, must be licensed by the State, and the State

3

thereby gains more control over that person than over

4

somebody who goes into the business of selling shoes, for

5

example.
MR. ROGOW:

6

It is true, Justice O'Connor, and

7

they are more highly regulated, and yet that regulation

8

must be delicate, because the lawyer's work informing

9

people of their rights, remedying wrongs, redressing

10

grievances, may be more important than selling shoes, and

11

so it needs to be able to be communicated if it's truthful

12

and nonmisleading, and that's exactly what this case is

13

about.

14

There is no issue in this case about anything

15

being untruthful or anything being misleading.

16

information is important.

17

court of appeals decision should be affirmed.

It needs to be protected.
