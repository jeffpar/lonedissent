ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN B. MORRISON

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MORRISON:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
In March 1987, the respondent here issued an

10
11

order to show cause to petitioner as to why he should not

12

be deported from the United States.

13

months later, after a hearing, the immigration judge

14

ordered petitioner deported, and petitioner then filed an

15

appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals, proceeding

16

pro se with a brief of approximately 13 pages.

17

Approximately 10

Three-and-a-half years later, the Board of

18

Immigration Appeals affirmed the order of deportation on

19

July 26, 1991, in a brief opinion dealing with the issues

20

presented.

21

Less than a month later, acting pursuant to the

22

rules of the Immigration Service, petitioner filed a

23

motion for reconsideration or reopening.

24

very short brief, and the Immigration Service attorney

25

filed a reply in the middle of October.

He later filed a

There the matter remained until the 3rd day of

1

2

February, 1993, at which time the Board of Immigration

3

Appeals denied the motion for reconsideration and

4

reopening in an order that ran a page and a little bit

5

onto the second page, most of which was boiler plate

6

response to the motion.

7

Petitioner then filed a petition for review in

8

the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit

9

on the 16th February, less than 2 weeks after the order

10

came down.

11

Government filed its brief in the end of April 1993, a

12

lengthy brief of some 33 pages, 14 of which dealt with the

13

merits of the challenge.

14

He filed his brief shortly thereafter, and the

In that brief, the Government said for the first

15

time to petitioner, you are too late.

16

filed your petition for review shortly within the 90 days

17

after July 1991.

18

thereafter, and in early January the Court of Appeals for

19

the Sixth Circuit issued its ruling.

20

You should have

Oral argument was held shortly

It concluded that the petition for review was

21

timely with respect to the denial of the motion for

22

reopening or reconsideration, but it was not timely with

23

respect to the original decision, even though the motions

24

were then pending before the Immigration Service.

25

It agreed with the Government that the failure

1

to file within the 90 days provided by the statute made

2

the filing too late when it came in February 1993, and the

3

question presented before this Court, on which the courts

4

of appeals are badly divided, is, is that decision

5

correct?
The Government recognizes that under the usual

6

7

rule in administrative law and judicial review, that a

8

timely filed motion for reconsideration or reopening

9

renders the decision of the agency not final, such that

10

not only need not a petitioner seek judicial review at

11

that time, but the petitioner may not seek judicial review

12

at that time.

13

And the reason for that rule is a sound one of

14

judicial economy.

15

in deciding cases if the agency which has the matter

16

before it has the ability and the power and under its

17

rules the authority to reconsider the decision at that

18

time.

The courts should not become involved

19

QUESTION:

I take it --

20

QUESTION:

I have two questions, Mr. Morrison.

21

Number 1, what happens if the petition for judicial review

22

is filed first, and then the petitioner decides, I'll ask

23

for a rehearing.

24
25

What happens then?

MR. MORRISON:

It is my understanding that the

usual rule is that the filing of a petition for judicial

1

review takes the matter into court, and that it does not

2

divest the agency of the authority to reconsider, although

3

it does not stop the court from considering the matter,

4

and in that circumstance it is up to the court to decide

5

whether it will choose to proceed with the case or allow

6

it not to proceed.

7

QUESTION:

Which the statute here -- an option

8

that the statute here eliminates.

9

MR. MORRISON:

10
11
12

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, I don't --

It says that they shall be

consolidated in such a situation -MR. MORRISON:

No.

It only says they shall be

13

consolidated, as I read it, if there are two or more

14

petitions for review.

15

That is to say, it does not direct the court of

16

appeals of the first case to hold it, and my reading of

17

the cases is that some courts more or less automatically

18

hold them if they are told.

19

automatically don't hold them, and in other cases they do

20

what seems to me the sensible thing to do, which is to

21

look at the motion for reconsideration to see whether it

22

really raises some new issues.

23

In some cases some courts

For instance, in the immigration area, where

24

often the change in circumstances of the country to which

25

the alien would be deported would be a very important

element.

If somebody was, for instance, to be sent back

2

to Bosnia, you would want to have the latest information

3

on what the state of the world was in Bosnia before you

4

sent the particular individual back.
On the other hand, if it was simply, you got it

5
6

wrong and you misread your opinion or the opinion of the

7

court of appeals there would be no particular reason for

8

the court to stay that.

9

QUESTION:

My second question is whether the

10

filing of the motion for reconsideration or for reopening

11

simply tolls the period for review, or does it

12

retroactively render the decision nonfinal so that you

13

have the full period at the end of -- once the petition

14

for reconsideration is disposed of?

15

MR. MORRISON:

I have not seen a case that deals

16

with that question, Your Honor, that comes up explicitly.

17

It wouldn't matter here in this particular case.

18

opinion --

19

QUESTION:

My own

Mr. Morrison, would you clarify what

20

you said before?

21

normal situation is, not only can you file the petition

22

for reconsideration first, but if you do -- if you do, you

23

have no final order and you can't file a notice of appeal.

24

Maybe I misunderstood you.

25

I thought you said that in most -- the

MR. MORRISON:

Yes, that is correct, Your Honor,

1

and the question I believe Justice Scalia was asking me,

2

is that because it makes it a tolling that you stop at

3

that point -- suppose they filed it, as in this case, on

4

day 26.

5

26 .

6

They filed the motion for reconsideration on day

The question that Justice Scalia I believe asked

7

me, does he -- does the petitioner here have 90 days from

8

the time of the denial of the motion for reconsideration,

9

or 90 minus 26, which I think is 64, and I don't know of

10
11

any case that answers that.
It is my opinion that the filing of the motion

12

for reconsideration renders it not final.

13

analogous, for instance, to what happens under the Federal

14

Rules of Civil Procedure, where a filing of a timely

15

motion for reconsideration under Rule 52a or 59 renders

16

the decision nonfinal and you get your full 30 days at the

17

end of that time.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

This would be

What happens if the Attorney General

then says, on the plane or on the ship, out you go?
One of the regulations says that the filing of

21

an application for reconsideration does not stop the

22

immediate deportation of the person.

Suppose you have

person out.

Do you have any way to stop that --

2

MR. MORRISON:

3

QUESTION:

4
5

Yes, Your Honor.

-- since you can't get to a court of

appeals?
MR. MORRISON:

You may not go to the court of

6

appeals under that circumstance.

7

jurisdiction under habeas corpus in the district court is

8

specifically preserved for that situation, and there are a

9

number of cases where that arises where the alien would

Under 1105a(a)(10) the

10

chen go to the district court where he would have to

11

obtain a stay of deportation, assuming that the agency

12

didn't give it to him.

13

I might point out, of course, two things.

The

14

first is, we do not concede in this case the validity of

15

that regulation, because we believe that that regulation

16

depends upon the authority under 8 U.S.C. 1252c, which is

17

the authority to deport, and it says there must be a final

18

order of deportation.

19

deport the alien.

20

You then may have 6 months to

This case doesn't present that question, so we

21

don't accept the validity of that regulation, and since

22

the phrases are the same in both statutes, we think they

23

should be interpreted together.

24
25

But even assuming the validity of the
regulation, we would first point out that in many cases,

as in this one here, Mr. Stone filed his motion for

Service ever try to deport him.

4

At no time did the

Indeed, it has not to this day tried to deport

5

him, even after it prevailed in the court of appeals, and

6

so it is in some respects true that the regulation

7

provides that, but it is not a process which automatically

8

goes forward.

9

6 months to do it.

10

The statute, indeed, gives the agency

QUESTION:

If you go to the district court on

11

habeas corpus, Mr. Morrison, what sort of considerations

12

does the district court look at in deciding whether to

13

give a stay or not?

14

MR. MORRISON:

I would think it would look at

15

two things, Your Honor.

First, it would look at, as in

16

any kind of an application for a stay, the equities, and

17

it might well look at the standard questions on a stay

18

such as the probability of success.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

Predicting probability of success in

the court of appeals?
MR. MORRISON:

Well, it's a little bit awkward.

22

I would suppose it would probably have to predict it

23

solely on the motion for reopening part of it.

24

happen very much for this very sensible reason, that the

It doesn't

deporting people when it has it fully within its power to

2

simply decide these matters.

3

This case is not an unusual one in which a

4

motion for consideration languished for 17 months before

5

the Immigration Service, and the Immigration Service looks

6

a little awkward trying to throw people out of the country

7

before a) they decide the case and b) they have given them

8

their statutory right to go to the court of appeals.

9
10
11

QUESTION:

Well, but the right to rehearing is

totally a creature of agency regulations.
MR. MORRISON:

12

would agree that --

QUESTION:

14

MR. MORRISON:

15
16

That is correct, Your Honor.

I

They could cut that out tomorrow.
I agree with that, and if they

cut it out we wouldn't have a situation like this.
The agency -- I think they could certainly on

17

reconsideration.

18

a little different, because there are statutory

19

requirements with regard to the country to which the

20

person could be sent and other kind of asylum and other

21

kind of issues, and it might have a lot more difficulty

22

cutting out reopening in terms of presenting new evidence.

23

On the reopening, Your Honor, it may be

But obviously neither of those cases is before

us today, and the agency, even today when Congress told

25

them in 1990 to issue new regulations, they finally got

around to proposing them 4 years later, and those

regulations continue, albeit under somewhat different

circumstances, the right to file for reconsideration and

for reopening.

5

QUESTION:

The part that I might be a little

6

confused about, that I need clarification about, is this.

7

Imagine that you are the immigrant, and now on day 1, down

comes an order.

interpretation --

It says, go.

10

MR. MORRISON:

QUESTION:

12

MR. MORRISON:

13

QUESTION:

Now, on the Government's

Your Honor, do you mean --

-- it's a final ---a final --

-- it's no reconsideration, final

14

order, go, and on the Government's interpretation, I know

15

what I'm supposed to do.

16

That stays the whole business.

17

I go and appeal immediately.

I file a petition for reconsideration.

When

18

that's finally decided I can appeal that, too, and the

thing will be consolidated.

how that works.

Well, I would say that Your Honor

17

is correct that that is the way the Government interprets

the statutory scheme.

19

analysis gives further force to my view that the

correct.

definition, many of them are proceeding pro se, they get

10

no notice, many of them don't speak any English, if they

20

It leads to the possibility of selective

QUESTION:

Well, why isn't the most rational

thing to do to say, file your notice of appeal

the court of appeals whether it wants to stay the appeal

MR. MORRISON:

1

Well, Your Honor, I would say two

2

things to that.

The first question, of course, is not

3

whether, if we were designing a system sitting here, we

4

would design the system that way.
The usual rule is to the contrary.

5

That is to

6

say, as I outlined it before, and as the ICC case makes it

7

clear, the usual rule is to the contrary, that you don't

8

burden the courts with even having to deal with the

9

administra -QUESTION:

10

But that was the ICC's position in

11

that case.

12

in the regulation, is the other way.

13

Here, the Attorney General's position, stated

MR. MORRISON:

Well, it was the ICC's position

14

because that was the way they could get the case thrown

15

out of court.

16

I would say that the Immigration Service over

17

the years in cases like Foti and Cheng Fan Kwok took

18

different positions on which court you could go to

19

depending on who was the winner or who was the loser in a

20

particular situation.

21

22

QUESTION:

But now there is no doubt about the

Attorney General's position.

23

MR. MORRISON:

24

QUESTION:

25

It's stated clearly --

Yes.

-- and if you just read the

regulations you'd know what you have to do, and you're

1

saying that the Attorney General can't have such a

2

regulation.

3

MR. MORRISON:

That is correct, and I say that

4

first because -- I want to answer Your Honor's question

5

about why the system wouldn't make sense.
It would make sense for everybody except the

6

7

courts of appeals.

8

judges would have to get these motions and sit down and

9

decide them regularly.

That is, the courts of appeals, the

In many cases, the briefs would have to be

10
11

filed, and the court would have to decide whether to hold

12

argument or hold in abeyance, they would have to decide

13

whether to issue an opinion, which might end up being an

14

advisory opinion, and all of those reasons are the same

15

whether it's the immigration case or the ICC or the NLRB,

16

and I suggest to you that in the absence of some

17

indication that Congress intended the result to be

18

different in this case from others, it should not be

19

different.
QUESTION:

20

Or even -- or for that matter, even

21

that the Attorney General intended the result to be

22

different.

23

regulation is not much different from the language of the

24

Hobbs Act that we interpreted in the ICC case.

25

so?

The language of the Attorney General's

Isn't that

MR. MORRISON:

1

Well, there is nothing in the

2

regulation itself that tells you when you go to court.

3

tells you when the alien can be deported, but there's

4

nothing in the regulation, which is of course another

My experience in the court of appeals is that if

Justice Breyer's question to you?

You in effect say the issue of whether a
petition for reopening stays the deportation is not before
us.

Does that mean we must assume for present purpose --

for purposes of deciding this case that the Government is
correct?
In which event it seems to me the problem he
poses you haven't answered, namely that a person is
ordered to be deported, and files a petition for
reopening, and loses the right to appeal because it's
rendered the order nonfinal, and may therefore be deported
at the whim of the Government.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. BRINKMANN:

10

11

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

The Attorney General acted well within the

authority delegated by Congress in establishing the

2

information that arises later.

3

The Attorney General did not provide that such

4

motions affect the finality of deportation orders.

5

There's nothing in the Immigration and Nationality Act or

6

the implementing regulations that requires the Attorney

7

General to surrender the finality of deportation orders as

8

a condition permitting such motions.

9

QUESTION:

I assume, just at this point you

10

might answer -- I think Justice Scalia brought up the fact

11

that her regulation doesn't say anything about whether or

12

not reconsideration tolls or makes it nonfinal, and the

13

regulation is written in the same words as the Hobbs Act,

14

as the Administrative Procedures Act, as interpreted by

15

this Court to mean that you file a motion for

16

reconsideration, it isn't final any longer, so what is it

17

that leads you to say that's what her decision is?

18

That isn't what her decision says.

That isn't

19

what the regulation says.

Morrison said.

2

in that case the Court agreed with the Interstate Commerce

Commission that those statutes did not require that, and

4

they did not prevent an agency from taking another

5

approach, which the Interstate Commerce Commission took,

6

in that motions to reconsider could affect the finality

7

and suspend that finality to stay the time for seeking

8

judicial review.

9

QUESTION:

But I think Justice Breyer's point is

10

that just as the Hobbs Act did not require it, so also the

11

text of the Attorney General's regulations do not require

12

it.

MS. BRINKMANN:

The language is virtually the same.
We believe that the Attorney

2

purposes of putting the person on the boat or the plane.
MS. BRINKMANN:

Yes, Your Honor, and not only

3

does that support the Attorney General's interpretation,

4

there's another aspect of the regulations where the

5

Attorney General provides that an alien does get an

6

automatic stay during an administrative appeal from the

7

immigration judge to the Board of Immigration Appeals,

8

therefore evidencing that the Attorney General not

9

providing such a stay means that -- after dismissal of an

10
11

appeal by the board means that that order is final.
We would also submit, Your Honor, that the

12

regulation concerning motions to reopen and reconsider

13

supports the Attorney General's interpretation in that it

14

requires section 3.8 of 8 C.F.R., that when an alien files

15

a motion to reopen or reconsider, the alien must specify

16

whether that deportation order is -- has been or is then

17

pending judicial review, clearly anticipating that

18

judicial review may -- should have gone forward if the

19

alien was intending to seek that.

interpretation of what section are we talking about when

you say that the Attorney General's interpretation is

important in the recognition of the deference and the

delegation of the authority Congress has given to the

also recognized that there were important interests of

that demonstrate Congress' interest in expedition of

In subsection (c), Congress explained that

think what we rely on that is to show the reasonableness

7

of the Attorney General's interpretation and that those

8

regulations should be read to view the lack of an

9

automatic stay as bolstering her finality regulation and

10

definition, because in the instance when it's not final,

11

when there's an administrative appeal from the immigration

12

judge to the board, she does give an automatic stay, so in

13

that sense I believe it bolsters the reasonableness of the

14

finality definition.

15

QUESTION:

We're not interested -- at the moment

16

I'm not interested in the reasonableness of that

17

interpretation, but is that the interpretation?

18

Look, you have language in the Hobbs Act which

19

says an order when it's served is final, okay, it's final

20

on the date when it's served, no matter whether there's a

21

petition for reconsideration, and the court says, that

22

language says it's final when it's served, but it isn't

23

final if you file a petition for reconsideration.

24

That's what this Court said, irrespective, and

25

this Court said it because the APA says exactly the same

The APA says it's final, no matter whether there's

Now we have for the third time a regulation this

8

wouldn't this regulation mean exactly what similar

MS. BRINKMANN:

Well, Your Honor, we urge that

Locomotive Engineers held that the language of the Hobbs

That's what the Court in American Farm Lines

said, and that was one of the cases on which the Court in

4

Locomotive Engineers relied, and that's what we submit

here.

6

This is a different context.
Under Weinberger v. Salfi the Court has held

7

that where Congress does not define finality of an agency

order and delegates authority to the agency, that

executive official has it well within her power to define

10

that finality, and we submit that's what the Attorney

General has done here, and that that deserves deference.

MS. BRINKMANN:

Your Honor, we believe that that

same argument could be made, for example, for imposing

exhaustion requirements on agencies which the Court in

6

Darby v. Cisneros held was not the role of the courts to

7

impose that when the statute and the agency have not

8

imposed that.

9

We believe, again, in the unique situation of

10

deportation, where newly occurring events may become

11

relevant, the parties agree that newly occurring events in

12

a country to which an alien may be deported may become

13

relevant, so there is always a potential for a motion to

reopen or reconsider to be brought in the administrative

15

process at any time during the period of judicial review.

1

MS. BRINKMANN:

Your Honor, we agree that there

2

is this recognition now in a statutory framework of the

3

motions to reopen and reconsider which the Attorney

4

General has long permitted.

5

We maintain, however, that under the Court's

6

rationale in cases like Foti and Cheng Fan Kwok, the Court

7

has recognized that it is within the Attorney General's

8

authority to define the scope of deportation proceedings

9

and, we would submit, the scope of motions to reopen and

10

reconsider, and the Court has acknowledged that that may

11

indeed impact the nature of judicial review, but under

12

this scheme, that is in the nature of things in the

13

authority that has been delegated to the Attorney General

14

to structure that framework.

15

So while we believe that the statute does

16

recognize the existence of motions to reopen and

17

reconsider, we again believe that it's within the

18

within the Attorney General's authority to structure the

19

administrative framework to define finality and to

20

interpret that as motions not affecting that finality.

21

QUESTION:

-- well

So you're staying with the position

22

that, despite Congress' recognition that there are such

23

things as reopening applications, that the Attorney

24

General can say, we're going to forget the whole business,

25

making the statute addressing nothing, because there's

nothing for it to address.
MS. BRINKMANN:

Your Honor, our argument

3

certainly doesn't rest on the authority to completely

4

abolish those motions, although there is no express

5

requirement of that in the statute.

6

But we do believe, as in the situation where --

7

in Foti where the Attorney General had altered the

8

administrative scheme to require that applications for

9

suspension of deportation now be brought into deportation

10

proceedings, that meant that the judicial review

11

provisions for deportation proceedings now were the sole

12

remedy, the sole avenue of judicial review for suspension.

13

In that same way, we believe that it's well

14

within the attorney general's discretion to set the limits

15

on motions to reopen and reconsider.

The only case the Government cites is Weinberger

action.

QUESTION:

Oh, I thought we've done that in

past.

I thought we have given deference to agencies in

9

their determination of when their action is final.
MR. MORRISON:

10

The only case in which that

11

arises is Weinberger v. Salfi.

12

sua sponte.

13

It was raised by the court

The Government did not object to jurisdiction,

14

did not object and said that they did not oppose the case

15

coming into court.

16

case, argued that the Government's interpretation of

17

finality, which was what's at stake there, should not be

18

given deference because the issue was raised by the court.

19

QUESTION:

No party, and this is a pre-Chevron

Mr. Morrison, are you saying that the

20

Hobbs Act couldn't be interpreted either way?

21

that was a case where the agency said, when we reconsider,

22

it makes it nonfinal for purposes of review.

23

could not have said under that act, under our regime

24

reconsideration does not stop the finality for purposes of

25

review?

Ms. Brinkmann kept insist -- was insistent that
that act was permissive, not mandatory.
MR. MORRISON:

I was interested to hear her

statement that anyone could go read that decision and

understand that it was permissive.

way around, that it was an interpretation of the Hobbs Act

7

as to when judicial review was available or not available.

9

I read it the other

In my view, it would be an incorrect
interpretation of the Hobbs Act and of the statute at

10

issue here to conclude the opposite of what I've urged,

11

but even if one could conclude the contrary, it would not

12

be because of the Attorney General's deference, to which

13

the Attorney General is due.

14

QUESTION:

But if she's right about what the

15

statute means, that under the statute an agency can decide

16

for itself whether its application for reconsider will

17

stay the finality of its order for purposes of review, if

18

she's right about that, then we do, we should defer to the

19

agency's implementation of the Hobbs Act, if it can be

20

implemented either way.

21

MR. MORRISON:

I do not believe that that

22

statute can mean that.

It must mean it in light of the

23

Administrative Procedure Act which establishes the general

24

rule that if there is reconsideration or rehearing, then

25

the agency's action is not final, and that the agency
