ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD C.DuMONT

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS LUDWIG, ET AL.

12

MR. DuMONT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case presents the question whether Federal

13

banking law permits national banks to act as agents in the

14

sale of annuities.

15

The Comptroller of the Currency, who has

16

supervisory authority over the national banking system,

17

based his conclusion that it does on three determinations,

18

each grounded in his technical and policy expertise:

19

first, that banks are authorized to broker financial

20

investments on behalf of their customers, second, that

21

modern annuity contracts are essentially investment

22

products, and third, that nothing in 12 U.S. Code section

23

92, which authorizes banks operating in small towns to

24

operate general insurance agencies, prohibits sales of

25

annuities by banks located elsewhere.

The court of

1

appeals erred by failing to defer to the Comptroller on

2

each of these judgements.
The general banking power statute, 12 U.S. Code

3
4

section 24 Seventh, provides at the outset that national

5

banks may exercise "all such incidental powers as shall be

6

necessary to carry on the business of banking."

7

what is part of the business of banking at any given time

8

requires an intimate understanding of a highly dynamic

9

field.

10

Defining

It is therefore a task uniquely within the

competence of the Comptroller.
QUESTION:

11

Well, Mr. DuMont, you rely on the

12

language in the seventh section there of the business of

13

banking.

14

MR. DuMONT:

15

QUESTION:

That's correct.
And that phrase is followed by a

16

listing of six specific things that banks can do, and it's

17

been my understanding that most courts have defined the

18

business of banking in terms of those specifically

19

enumerated powers rather than something more broad.

20

Should we not look to the six specific things and see if

21

something is closely related to those?

22

MR. DuMONT:

I think the courts are certainly

23

well advised to look at those things as exemplary of what

24

is encompassed within the business of banking, the core

25

business of banking.

QUESTION:

1

But you think any investment

2

instrument of financial investment interest is within the

3

business of banking even though it's not mentioned in any

4

of the six listed things?
MR. DuMONT:

5

We think that the language of the

6

first phrase there, 24 Seventh, is broad enough to go

7

beyond just the listed powers, and the courts have so held

8

in a variety of cases, including -QUESTION:

9
10

policies of any kind.

11

MR. DuMONT:

Including the selling of insurance

Well, I think if you wanted to

12

operate a general insurance agency you would be in the

13

province of section 92, but let me point out that the

14

second sentence of section 24 Seventh I think is very

15

important here, if I may, and the second sentence, which

16

was added in the 1930's, says the business of dealing in

17

securities and stock by the association shall be limited

18

to purchasing and selling, and so on.

19

It goes on to -- it recognizes the existence of

20

the business of dealing in securities and stock, and this

21

Court has twice before recognized in --

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. DuMONT:

24
25

You mean the Glass-Steagall -That's the Glass-Steagall

provision.

And they wouldn't have had to add it

1

unless the sale of securities and stock had been covered,

2

is your point.

3

MR. DuMONT:

Well, my point is that the way that

4

that sentence is phrased indicates that it is not granting

5

a new power but recognizing and limiting one that was

6

already granted.

7

recognized that fact in both Clarke v. Securities Industry

8

Association and SIA Board of Governors.

9

In fact, this Court has specifically

QUESTION:

Well, could a bank have power to deal

10

in expensive art for investment purposes?

11

art as an investment.

12

MR. DuMONT:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. DuMONT:

Some people use

I think that that would -Is that within their powers, too?
Well, that sort of question would

15

be one for the Comptroller in the first instance and, of

16

course, is not involved here.

17

QUESTION:

I think --

Well, do you think the language would

18

stretch that far?

19

interpretation by the Comptroller to which we should

20

defer?

21

Would that be a reasonable

MR. DuMONT:

I think that if there were a

22

practice, as there is in this case over a long period of

23

years, of banks dealing in that kind of thing as agent for

24

their customers without substantial equity risk, and that

25

that had been recognized by the courts over time, I think

1

it would be reasonable for the Comptroller -- and, by the

2

way, I think I should add, if other banks and savings

3

institutions regulated by other entities, such as State

4

banks or Federal thrifts, were engaging in the same

5

activity, I think it would be reasonable --

6

QUESTION:

And do you say that the sale of

7

annuities is something that has been carried out over a

8

long period of time by national banks?

9

MR. DuMONT:

I say that the sale of investment

10

products, the brokering of investment products is

11

something that has been carried --

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. DuMONT:

Annuities.
Well, they are different questions.

14

The sale of investment products has been carried out over

15

a long period of time by banks, and that's --

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. DuMONT:

How about annuities?
Annuities have been sold by banks

18

other than those regulated by the Comptroller in the last

19

several years.

20

part of that business, other banks, and that's really part

21

of the Comptroller's point here, is that there are lots of

22

banking institutions that are conducting exactly this kind

23

of agency sale, and there's no reason why national banks

24

should not be allowed to encompass that within their

25

business of banking.

In fact, banks are quite a substantial

But we're perfectly willing to address the

1

2

question of why annuities are like -- modern annuities are

3

like investment products of the kind that banks have

4

traditionally brokered.

5

QUESTION:

6

products come from?

7

MR. DuMONT:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. DuMONT:

Where does the term, investment
Is that some part of the statute?
It is not a statutory term.
Then why do you use it?
Well, I think that the -- the

10

statutory term is, the business of banking.

11

is, what is fairly encompassed within the business of

12

banking and powers incidental thereto?

13

The question

The Comptroller has determined that the

14

brokerage sale of investment products of a variety of

15

different kinds, whether or not they are securities and

16

stock specifically recognized by the statute --

17

QUESTION:

Did he -- in his ruling did he use

18

the term, investment products?

19

MR. DuMONT:

20

I believe, financial investment

products, yes, or financial investment instruments.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. DuMONT:

Did he define it?
Well, the discussion goes on to

23

talk about exactly why they are investment instruments in

24

the modern context, why annuities are, and I can turn to

25

that.

1

I think that if you look at the modern market,

2

and this is something the Comptroller did, that the

3

essential feature of the modern annuity contract is really

4

a tax deferral feature.

5

QUESTION:

In the accumulation of --

Mr. DuMont, before you go on with

6

that, would you just tell us the expression, business of

7

banking, you said that the six specifics are exemplary,

8

not exclusive.

9

the term, business of banking, or are there no limits

Where would one look to find the limits of

10

that -- that emerge from the text, one must see what banks

11

are doing at a particular point in time?

12

MR. DuMONT:

Well, I think it's perfectly fair

13

to look at the text as a good starting point for what is

14

the business of banking, but I think it would be erroneous

15

to take a statute like this, that is really an organic law

16

to govern the development -- to govern the existence of

17

the banking industry and to try to freeze at any one time

18

exactly what banks are doing, and say, well, they were

19

doing that in 1864, and unless Congress acts specifically,

20

they can do no other thing from now on.

21

And I would point out that this Court has had to

22

address a variety of issues, such as borrowing money,

23

which are not specifically referred to in section 24

24

Seventh, and yet the Court has not had a lot of trouble

25

saying, well, look, we look at a particular case with

1

particular facts, and this is a power which is necessary

2

to carry on the business of banking, and I think that's

3

exactly the kind of analysis we look to here.

4

Now, there are a variety of -- the text is the

5

best starting point, but also, I do think that as the

6

business develops, and banks in a variety of jurisdictions

7

start dealing with particular kinds of products that one

8

can fairly look to that development, as the Court really

9

did, or as the State and lower Federal courts did, in the

10

case of securities and stock, which may or may not have

11

been part of the business of banking in the 1860's, but

12

certainly by the time of the 1930's, when Glass-Steagall

13

was passed, this Court has properly recognized that that

14

was a recognized part of what banks were doing.

15

brokering securities and stock for their customers.

16

QUESTION:

They were

Mr. DuMont, may I ask you a related

17

question?

18

but just assume for the sake of argument that the

19

annuities in question could be classified either as

20

securities or as insurance.

Just assume -- I know you don't assume this,

Just take that as a given.

In deciding which way to classify them, I would

21
22

like to know, if we do know, what the object of section 92

23

was.

24

beyond its desire to help out the little banks by giving

25

them an extra source of cash, that its object also

I have assumed that the object of section 92 was --

reflected an intent to protect independent insurance

2

brokers.

3

Am I right?
And if I am right, is that a reason for

4

construing the -- for saying that, other things being

5

equal, we ought to recognize that objective, and we ought

6

to construe these annuities as being insurance rather than

7

securities in order to realize the protective object of

8

92?

9

MR. DuMONT:

Well, to answer the first question,

10

I don't think it would be particularly appropriate to

11

consider that a central purpose of 92, to protect

12

insurance agents.

13

primary legislative history, the Comptroller's letter on

14

the subject in 1916, that banks should not become

15

department stores and --

16

There is concern expressed in the

QUESTION:

And didn't that letter also -- I

17

forget the exact words, but didn't that letter make some

18

such remark as, you know, it's not going to hurt the

19

others too much?

20

banks will be able to make a little money on this, but

21

it's not going to hurt the others, by which I assume they

22

meant the insurance brokers?

23

They said, well, you know, the little

MR. DuMONT:

I think there was certainly

24

recognition of that, but again, I think you need to look

25

at that in the context of what 92 was doing, which was
12

1

authorizing a national bank operating in a small town to

2

carry on an entire general agency.
QUESTION:

3

Oh, I realize it was doing that, but

4

that's where it stopped, and why would it have stopped

5

unless it wanted to protect insurance brokers?
MR. DuMONT:

6

7

92 was limited to granting an additional power.
QUESTION:

8

9

Well, we really think that section

Well, I know, but what about the

answer to my question?

Assuming that we recognize that

10

there's a limitation there, isn't the only likely object

11

of the limitation to protect insurance brokers?
MR. DuMONT:

12

No.

Even if we grant that there's

13

some preemptive scope to 92, and that therefore there's a

14

question to be decided about what was the purpose of 92

15

and what might be the sort of insurance product that falls

16

within it, there's no indication that that was meant to

17

sweep away any product that might ever be sold by an

18

insurance company, or anything that might for some

19

purposes be denominated insurance.
And in this context, we'd be perfectly willing

20
21

to concede, as you say, that annuities might for some

22

purposes be classified as insurance and for other purposes

23

not.

24

it was perfectly within the Comptroller's province to

25

decide --

As long as they're in that middle ground, it is --

QUESTION:

1

I grant you that, but I think you're

2

getting a little bit away from my question.

3

is, why did they put the limitation?

4

it to the small banks, and was there any reason they did

5

so, except to protect insurance brokers?
MR. DuMONT:

6

My question

Why did they limit

Well, certainly.

I mean, they --

7

first of all, the presumption was that a bank in a large

8

city had plenty of banking business and didn't need the

9

additional revenue.
That's the primary reason, and that's reflected

10
11

in the Comptroller's letter, and also that a bank in a

12

large town that had lots of banking business should be

13

concentrating its attention primarily on its banking

14

business as opposed to running a general insurance agency,

15

whereas none of those things applied in the small town.
Incidentally, he did mention that they also

16
17

wouldn't be taking business away from insurance brokers in

18

small towns because they might not be an insurance broker

19

in such a town.
All of that is fine, but I don't think it gets

20
21

away from the central purpose of 92 being to confer

22

additional power on banks and small towns to allow them to

23

raise extra revenue by operating a general insurance

24

agency, and really none of those purposes was engaged

25

here.

QUESTION:

1

Is it a plausible argument to say

2

that an annuity can be both insurance and a security, or

3

are these mutually exclusive categories?

4

MR. DuMONT:

Well, to begin with, it's

5

importance to distinguish -- for instance, the Court's

6

prior cases like Bailey, for one, and United Benefit Life,

7

looked in the securities law context at whether something

8

was a security, on one hand, or an annuity contract or

9

insurance on the other, and that made sense in that

10

statutory context because the specific statutory exception

11

was from securities law for annuity contracts or insurance

12

contracts.

13

We have a very different context here, which is

14

a statute which simply confers some authority to deal in a

15

broad range of insurance products on banks and small

16

towns.

17

There isn't anything to set against insurance

18

like securities.

19

really deciding, is it one or the other.

20

can perfectly well be both.

21

within the scope of insurance as that is intended in

22

section 92?

23

There's no other product that you're
In this case, it

The question is, does it fall

And our answer to that is, the Comptroller was

24

perfectly within the grounds of reason to conclude that

25

no, because these products in the modern marketplace were

1

sufficiently like modern, other modern investment

2

products, and sufficiently unlike the broad range of

3

general insurance products, that he could determine that

4

they are part of the business of banking and --

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. DuMONT:

7

QUESTION:

How unlike are they --- not go under section 92.
How unlike are they to life insurance

8

contracts?

9

about regular life insurance, that it's -- that it's a

10
11

Why -- couldn't you make the same argument

form of investment?
MR. DuMONT:

Well, I think it depends on what

12

kind of life insurance we're talking about.

13

insurance, no, I don't think you can make the same --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. DuMONT:

16

No.

Pure term

Well, no --

there are a variety of insurance

products --

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. DuMONT:

Whole life, right.
The insurance industry has shown

19

itself to be very inventive in operating in that medium

20

ground between pure investment and pure insurance.

21

QUESTION:

It's always been considered -- whole

22

life insurance, anyway, has always been considered a

23

medium of saving and investment as well as a medium of

24

life insurance, hasn't it?

25

MR. DuMONT:

I think it has, to the extent that

1

it has always existed, which -QUESTION:

2

So your argument would lead to the

3

conclusion that at least insofar as straight life

4

insurance -- not term insurance, but investment life

5

insurance is concerned, bank could have been life

6

insurance agents.

7

MR. DuMONT:

The Comptroller has made no

8

determination on that, but our argument would be that the

9

Comptroller could look at a particular set of insurance

10

products, including whole universal life products, and

11

decide that if they have predominantly -- predominantly

12

investment characteristics they are within the scope of

13

the banking powers and outside the scope of section 92.

14

QUESTION:

And you think that's faithful to what

15

was sought to be achieved by this amendment regarding

16

insurance.

17

generally could engage in the sale of whole life

18

insurance.

19

just -- it doesn't seem to me very likely.

an insurance policy or an annuity that doesn't give any

scope for the development of the business of banking and

the development of the products.

5

I mean, I think if you really looked at 1916

life insurance products and annuity products, then and

now, you'd find that they are very different, the market

is very different, the country is very different, and the

business of banking is very different.

There's no reason

why one should freeze the business of banking or the

I thought you had told me that the

Okay.

What I'd like to know -- and I

6

take it there are then some semicolons and a number of

you look at banking practices as they have grown up in

Yes, Your Honor.

MR. ROSENTHAL:

I haven't looked as carefully as

I should have on that issue.
My understanding is that the banks which sell

If I may turn it around, what was the purpose of

Congress adding the language at the beginning of 24(7) if

it was not to preserve the right to sell some products

I think that the Comptroller had

that an insurance policy, a life insurance policy dealt -

deals with an insurable risk, the risk that someone will

I concede that all of them have mortality calculations,

but there area lot of instruments and a lot of entities

which have mortality calculations which are not insurance.

20

The key is, and I think the Court has said this,

21

sharing of insurance risk, and I believe that the

authorities which we've cited, and there are voluminous

academic authorities, say that annuities are not insurance

because they do not involve an insurance risk.

insurance companies would argue that living to a ripe old

Only the

age constitutes a risk.
QUESTION:

2

Mr. Rosenthal, what about the cases

3

that this Court had, the Manhart case involving -- those

4

involved annuities, the TIA Craft cases, where there

5

were -- there was a pooling male and female, and the

6

question was whether that was lawful under title VII, but

7

that was -- it was certainly pooling a risk.
MR. ROSENTHAL:

8

I think pooling -- the word

9

pooling occurs, but the question is, was there a pooling

10

of insurance risk, and I think what the Comptroller said

11

in his opinion and what I think he was reasonable in

12

concluding was that annuities do not involve a pooling of

13

insurance risk, and we've cited in our briefs, and I think

14

it's hard to disagree that there are lots of authorities

15

out there, lots of academicians, lots of court cases which

16

have held that annuities, fixed annuities do not involve a

17

pooling of insurance risk.

18

They do involve mortality calculations.

We

19

concede that, but we don't think this that that's the

20

hallmark.

QUESTION:

They do involve a pooling, so you're

I'd like to start by talking about the pooling

Mr. Rosenthal, because it seems to us very critical here

All I'm saying is -- and it's a

MR. STEWART:

11

I think it does not make a

difference, because when you're dealing with the risk of

13

life and death, it is not that the risk may not happen.

14

That's what you have with an indemnity policy.

Now, people buy it for other reasons, like

way.

towards is this:

stocks and bonds?

I'm drawing a difference, and what I'm driving
why isn't this more like banking than

9

People put money in a bank account, and the bank

pays interest, so instead of the bank paying interest, the

11

bank one day says, I'll tell you what we'll do, we'll save

12

all this money for you, and then we'll pay it back to you

13

with some interest later on when you retire, in equal

14

monthly payments.

15

Now, people do put money in banks all the time,

16

and they do want to get back this money.

17

more like banking than taking your money and buying a

18

stock and bond?

19

MR. STEWART:

Why isn't this

Well, Your Honor, I think this is

20

an elegant theoretical construct, but I don't think it's

21

the way that the pooling of risk has been viewed in

22

insurance and in fact what Congress had in mind when you

23

look at section 92, for example, which talks specifically

24

only in extending insurance powers for representation of a

25

life insurance company as well as others.

the text of the statute, that the national bank in a small

a theoretical possibility, I don't think it's in the

That's right in

So you mean if insurance companies --

this is -- they're not selling life insurance, they're

selling something called an annuity, and I agree that

insurance companies also sell annuities.
You're saying that 92 means that if insurance

12

13

companies decide to sell off their real estate -- they

14

have a lot of bad real estate investments -- or if they --

15

is it whatever insurance companies do that they can't do?

What is the interpretation of that, 92?

insurance companies used to sell, that means banks, or if

insurance companies sold a lot of it -- is -- how does

that work?
MR. STEWART:

Aren't there two other problems with

your analogy?

You say that what is being insured here is

other income or not, and so in both of those respects

there's a clear distinction from kind of the paradigm case

of casualty insurance.

MR. STEWART:

QUESTION:

That is, it seems to me is direct

Mr. Stewart, why isn't it appropriate

10

to look at this, as Justice Breyer I think suggested, from

11

the point of view of the bank's customer, the notion that

12

the customer has savings, wants to invest the savings for

13

a return that will be there for a rainy day, for later

14

years, and that an annuity is today a substitute for that,

15

more attractive, but it serves the same customer who has

16

savings and wants to invest the savings for a return.

17

So the bank is serving that very same need that

18

was once served in a very simple way and now there are

19

more ways to serve it.

the bank serving its customer, the depositor, why aren't

Well, I'm curious, though, inasmuch

as this Court has said those instruments are securities,

whether it wouldn't fall squarely within that provision.

MR. STEWART:

We think not, because they're a

12

different kind of security, and here it's necessary to

13

harmonize the provision there with the provision of

14

section 92, which we do think has a powerful negative

implication, because variable annuities have both security

and insurance characteristics.

I think Justice Kennedy's

question was on point on that.

They do have both

characteristics.

Banks have been allowed to sell securities, but

the assumption in that has been, these are tradable

securities.

that kind of security, and in order to harmonize that,

Mr. Stewart, you may already have

alluded to this, hut let me ask you, with respect to your

argument that in fact the enumerated powers are

sentence of the seventh section makes no sense, except on

6

the congressional assumption that the enumeration was not

exclusive, because there's nothing in the enumeration that

would be taken to refer to stocks and securities, so

Congress must have assumed that in fact the so-called

powers incident to banking were broader.

with that?
MR. STEWART:

How do you deal

Well, I think there's some

13

confusion here, because the initial stock and security

trading power for national banks was created by the

15

McFadden Act in 1927, and that was an affirmative grant of

power.

The

Well, I think if, in fact, that

issue, the bank's ability to sell securities, had come to

had to be that they lacked the power to do so.

talking about, the second sentence, the business of

2

dealing in securities, when was that sentence enacted by

3

Congress?

4

MR. STEWART:

Well, it's first form was enacted

5

in 1927 in the McFadden Act, and then it was amended in

6

the Glass-Steagall Act.

8

QUESTION:

The McFadden Act was '27, the Glass-

Steagall Act was '33, or --

9

MR. STEWART:
QUESTION:

10

'33 or '34.

I'm sorry, I don't quite understand,

11

because I have in front of me two sentences from section

12

24(7).

13

We know what those two sentences are, right?
All right.

Now, are you saying that in the

14

statute books there's some other sentence some place that

15

affirmatively gives to banks the authority to sell

16

securities?

MR. STEWART:

10

Well

He wants to --

I'm referring to the development

of the statute.
QUESTION:

11

So you're -- I misunderstood you,

12

too.

You're saying that the predecessor sentence of the

13

sentence which now is the final one in section 7 extended

14

that authority.

That's what you're saying.

15

MR. STEWART:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. STEWART:

Authorized those activities, yes.

Yes.

I understand you.

I did want to talk just a second

18

about the sequence of the statutes here, because it seems

19

to us very important.

20

It included an -- the incidental powers clause without

21

change for the last 130 years.

22

Section 24(7) was adopted in 1863.

In 1915 and 1916, almost 50 years -- more than

23

50 years later, the Federal Reserve Board and the

24

Comptroller concluded -- and now it's -- the national

25

banks had no insurance powers.

In fact, the Comptroller

1

said insurance was an outside business naturally belonging

2

to others.

3

Now, he then asked for a statute to be enacted

4

to allow the banks and small towns, national banks and

5

small towns to exercise these powers, and specifically he

6

specified that it would be unwise and undesirable to give

7

it to the banks in larger towns.

8

This sequence, it seems to us, is very powerful,

9

because the Comptroller is saying that in 1990 he's all of

10

a sudden discovered that back in 1863 that statute

11

actually authorized insurance sales and annuity

12

insurance -- sales of annuities all along, and I think

13

that renders the entire sequence in 1915 and 1916

14

really --

15

QUESTION:

I don't think the argument was all

16

along.

17

over time, and I think as Mr. Rosenthal put it, this

18

statute is like some other statutes that are meant to

19

govern a business.

20

mean something different today than it meant when it was

21

originally put in the Sherman Act.

22

I think it was, the business of banking changes

The phrase,

MR. STEWART:

"restraint of trade" may

Well, but this Court in construing

23

section 24(7) has been very careful to tie any extension

24

to those powers to the express powers enumerated in

25

section 24(7) .

As Justice Sutherland wrote in the First

2

into effect those powers which are granted.

3

powers can only be used in that regard.

4

QUESTION:

Incidental

It's not very helpful to limit

5

somebody to the business of banking if the business of

6

banking means anything that banks want to do.

MR. STEWART:

(Laughter.)

9

QUESTION:

And do in sufficient numbers.

MR. STEWART:

10

Yes.

Yes, and of course, that's a very

11

fair point, which is, the statute does not say the

12

business of banks.

13

which must mean something more, and indeed --

14

It says, the business of banking,

QUESTION:

Do you take the position -- I just

15

want to be sure.

Do you take the position that the

16

concept of banking was frozen as of the date of the

17

enactment of the statute?

18

MR. STEWART:

19

QUESTION:

20

Well then, you disagree with Justice

Scalia's question, I gather.
MR. STEWART:

21
22

Absolutely not.

Well -- I don't think that was the

import.

MR. STEWART:
