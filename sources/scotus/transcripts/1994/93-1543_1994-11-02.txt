ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. TERRY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. TERRY:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
Our case is about age discrimination.

11
12

Particularly, this case is about the after-acquired

13

information doctrine, or the after-acquired evidence

14

doctrine.
The so-called after-acquired information in

15
16

these cases varies, but it bears two common

17

characteristics.

18

a questioned employment practice, usually after litigation

19

has begun.

20

information would be a legitimate basis for terminating

21

the employee.

22

First, the information is acquired after

Second, the employer contends that the

Simply stated, the issue in this case is, what

23

significance should attach to such after-acquired evidence

24

in cases, in discrimination cases arising under the

25

Federal civil rights statutes?

Clearly, there are two camps.

1

The Sixth Circuit

2

and other courts have determined that such after-acquired

3

evidence is a complete defense to liability and bars all

4

relief.

5

determined that after-acquired evidence is not a defense

6

to liability but may, in appropriate cases, impact upon

7

relief.

The Third Circuit and other courts have

We come to this Court with the notion that the

8

9

after-acquired evidence doctrine is nothing new.

10

believe that for more than 30 years this Court's

11

construing the decisions of this Court and agencies

12

construing other Federal statutes have been confronted

13

with the after-acquired defense by employers seeking to

14

avoid liability under other statutes protecting employees'

15

rights.

16

Western Railroad in 1961, this Court and the other courts

17

and the agencies have found that after-acquired evidence,

18

as a defense, does not bar all remedy.

19

We

In each case, beginning with Still v. Norfolk &

QUESTION:

Well, Still was somewhat different

20

than the present case, wasn't it?

21

question of whether the person was an employee for

22

purposes of the FELA, even though he might have had

23

misinformation on his application form?

24
25

MR. TERRY:

Wasn't that the

Mr. Chief Justice, Still was under

the Federal Employers' Liability Act, and it was a case

involving an employee seeing compensation for a back

2

injury, and there was a question about information that he

3

had provided in his form, but he railroad in Still took

the position that he was not an employee, not qualified to

5

be an employee.

6

position, and so do some of the courts that extend the --

7

9

The respondent in this case takes that

QUESTION:

The respondent doesn't say that the

petitioner in this case never was an employee.
MR. TERRY:

No, but the plaintiff in Still had

10

worked for Norfolk and Western Railroad for 6 years, just

11

like the plaintiff here had worked for the Nashville

12

Banner for 40 years, so the theory that somehow the

13

misconduct or the application error or misstatement has

14

removed the standing or the qualification was the same.

15

QUESTION:

Well, what remedies, Mr. Terry, do

16

you say are available to the petitioner if it is

17

discovered during the course of the discovery proceedings

18

that valid cause existed for the employer to fire the

19

petitioner?

20

MR. TERRY:

Justice O'Connor, the first -- in

21

answering your question, and maybe you have already

22

suggested that we think the first and very important part

23

of this rule that we propose is that the employer show

24

under a standard similar to the standard in Price

25

Waterhouse that they would have terminated the employee.

They must show this by objective evidence in a

1

2

fair, factfinding proceeding.

3

that the remedies should be fashioned by the facts.

4

Clearly, if the employer would have terminated the

5

employee, then in most cases reinstatement and front pay

6

are inappropriate, but we do not believe that backpay

7

should be barred, and we believe that their backpay should

8

be awarded in most cases, and awarded to the point of

9

judgment to satisfy the -- to satisfy the objectives of

10

If that is done, we believe

the ADEA and title VII.
QUESTION:

11

What about the situation of an

12

employer discovering that there was a fraudulent

13

employment application, that a qualification for the job,

14

for example, was a certain education degree, and the

15

employee had fraudulently said she had that degree, and

16

it's later discovered.

17

you suppose?
MR. TERRY:

18

Now, what kind of relief there, do

We -- the answer to your question is

19

the same.

We propose that that employee should receive

20

backpay if they can -- if they can establish a

21

discrimination claim, but the fear in that result, and the

22

problem with that result, is removed by the idea that the

23

employer should be able to pursue State civil and criminal

24

remedies to recover any unjust compensation or any injury

25

that the employer has suffered, so in these extreme cases,

1

when we talk about the so-called nondoctor doctor, or the

2

case where the day-care worker is a child molester, that

3

type of case that are used as examples, the case, the

4

facts of the case take care of themselves.

5

QUESTION:

Do they do that by way of a

6

counterclaim?

Would the offset be on the employer's

7

part -- you said you imagine, you could imagine a case

8

where civil, even criminal liability, but let's take the

9

civil.

Would that come into the very same case, the

10

discrimination case, by way of counterclaim?

11

play out?

MR. TERRY:

How would it

13

be - - will mostly be found in State law.

If the

Yes, exactly.
But then, as Justice Ginsburg said,

it would be an offset to the judgment?
MR. TERRY:

Absolutely.

There would be no money

exchanged in a lot of these cases that people seem to be

23

afraid about, and the purposes of title VII and ADEA would

be served by - -

1

the ADEA trumps any other State recovery mechanism?

2

Wouldn't you say that the Federal policy should prevail,

3

and therefore there shouldn't be a recoupment?

4

MR. TERRY:

No.

Our position is that if the

5

employer has a valid State law claim, and I might mention

6

that some of the recoupment - -

QUESTION:

For the recovery of some of this

MR. TERRY:

Or it could be a situation, let's

10

take for - - where the employee has caused some actual

11

damage or injury on the job.
QUESTION:

12

Well, that I can understand, but if

13

you're talking about recovery of the very backpay to which

14

the employee is entitled under the act, or determined by

15

the court to be entitled under the act, are you conceding

16

that that might be a proper subject of recovery under some

17

State law action?

out as a lawyer, and in fact is not a lawyer, and they

2

discover that, if he had been doing his job adequately and

3

the employer hadn't been sued, I take it no damage under

your theory?

7

MR. TERRY:

In a lot of these cases, that's the

situation, Justice -QUESTION:

Despite the fact that it's somewhat

8

outrageous that the person held himself out as a lawyer

9

and in fact was not.

10

MR. TERRY:

Yes, and -- but in that case you may

11

also find some theory of unjust enrichment, and you will

12

also find that the local district attorney will probably

13

initiate a criminal prosecution just like they would in

14

the nondoctor doctor situation, and part of the criminal

15

prosecution could also involve restitution of part of the

16

money that was received.

17

QUESTION:

Well, now you're causing me to get

18

confused again.

19

you can't get the backpay back.

20

back as backpay, but you can get it back as restitution,

21

or as unjust enrichment?

22

I thought that you told Justice Souter

MR. TERRY:

You say you can't get it

You can get it back if there's

23

injury and if there's harm, or if there's some viable

24

State remedy that the title - -

QUESTION:

So you can get the backpay back.

MR. TERRY:

QUESTION:

3

If
You just need a state cause of action

for unjust enrichment or for restitution, right?

4

MR. TERRY:

If -- if the -- yes.

If there is

5

a -- we do not believe that the purpose of title -- I

6

think this Court has said in cases such as McDonnell

7

Douglas and McDonald v. Santa Fe and Sure Tan that title

8

VII, that wrongdoing by an employee doesn't remove that

9

employee from the protections of title VII and ADEA.
QUESTION:

10

Okay, let me make sure I understand.

11

I take it you are saying that a State action for the

12

return of backpay on the theory that backpay is, per se,

13

unjust enrichment in these circumstances, would be barred,

14

is that correct?

15

unjust enrichment claim to recover the backpay under State

16

law which had just been awarded by Federal court under

17

this act.

18

The employer could not simply bring an

The answer to that question is if

19

the State law was passed and promoted as a defense to

20

title VII, then it would have those problems.

was a valid existing State remedy --

QUESTION:

If there

And wouldn't your argument be that in

fact the State law was barred by the ADEA?
MR. TERRY:

If that was the purpose, if the

purpose of the State law was to frustrate the purposes of

1

ADEA, or title VII, then it would have problems.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. TERRY:

4

QUESTION:

Sure.
But if -Now, what if it's a general State law

5

saying no one shall be unjustly enriched, and let's assume

6

that under State law as a general rule the payment of

7

salary to someone who has misrepresented qualifications

8

for the office for which the salary is paid would be a

9

proper subject for unjust enrichment recovery, would you

10
11

say that the ADEA would not bar that State law claim?
MR. TERRY:

Yes, I would, but I would also say

12

that it would be my understanding of that claim that the

13

employee, as Justice Kennedy has suggested, if they've

14

done the job, if the employer has received benefit for

15

what he's paid, that the unjust enrichment claim would not

16

succeed to the extent of the backpay.

17

QUESTION:

Okay, and the easy claim would be the

18

case of the nonlawyer lawyer whose firm has been sued for

19

malpractice and has had to recover.

20

be able to claim against the nonlawyer lawyer.

21

wouldn't be a claim for the return of backpay, it would

22

simply be a claim for what they had been forced to pay as

under respondeat superior.

could do that.

They

QUESTION:

1

Could a judge in such an instance

2

determine the order of trial and say, I'm going to try the

3

counterclaim first, and that may render any discrimination

4

claim academic because of the size of the damages?
MR. TERRY:

5

Your Honor, no.

We believe that the

6

plaintiff is entitled to establish the title VII or ADEA

7

claim even if damages is completely out of the equation

8

because of unjust enrichment or some other recovery.

9

There is other relief that the plaintiff may be entitled

10

to, or that the defendant should be affected by other than

11

damages.

12

QUESTION:

Let me take you back just one step to

13

clarify, if I understand correctly, that even if you lose

14

on your main argument you are contesting the propriety of

15

summary judgment here, because it was -- you were not

16

given an opportunity to challenge whether this misconduct

17

would in fact have led to the discharge.

18

MR. TERRY:

Absolutely, under the appropriate

19

standard, which we think is articulated in Price

20

Waterhouse, where -- which requires objective evidence and

21

clear issues of fact which were present in this case, a

to this is that until there is a rule, a rule articulated

20

by this Court, when you start with the procedural problems

21

that are presented in the district court, the problems are

shown in this case.

9
10
11

MR. TERRY:

Because they don't have to face

reinstatement or front pay, but they have the same
obligations under backpay, and backpay is critical.
As this court said before, it's the spur, it's

12

the catalyst, it is the backbone to deterrence and

13

compensation under Albemarle, and we do concede that there

14

is some advantage to the employer, but it puts the

15

employer in the same position they would have been absent

16

the discrimination.

17

that point, they can refuse reinstatement.

18

If they have a legitimate reason at

We do think that this rule balances the employer

19

and employee interests.

predetermined national penalty.

QUESTION:

But why don't you go for the whole

discovery the employer would never have found out and

would never have discharged for any other reason, other

than the age discrimination.

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Our position is that evidence of an employee's

21

misconduct that is acquired after the employer has

22

discharged that employee on the basis of age has no

23

bearing on the question of liability under the Age

24

Discrimination in Employment Act.

We believe that the appropriate

cutoff date is the date upon which the employer would have

discovered the information had there been no

11

discrimination and no lawsuit.

12

QUESTION:

That's kind of a hard test to employ.

13

Don't you think that -- isn't it true that the EEOC has

14

used, and perhaps now uses, a cutoff date of when the

15

employer actually discovers it?

16

MR. GORNSTEIN:

The EEOC position on this issue

17

has evolved, and at one point it was using or advising its

18

investigators -- there's never been an EEOC regulation on

19

this.

20

QUESTION:

What is it using now?

21

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Right now, the position is the

22

one reflected in our brief, which is that the cutoff date

should go to the date on which the employer would have

24

discovered the information had there been no

25

discrimination.

basic points.

2

statute that would license an employer to discriminate on

3

the basis of age against an employee who is engaged in

4

this conduct.

5

There is no exception in the

Second, as this Court's decisions have made

6

clear, the critical question in determining the issue of

7

liability under the statute, is what actually motivated

8

the employer at the time of the adverse action, and that

9

point is crucial here.

10

Since this case arises on summary judgment, it

11

must be assumed that at the time the respondent discharged

12

petitioner, it acted entirely on the basis of her age.

13

Under the plain language of the statute, that was

14

sufficient to establish a violation.

15

After-acquired evidence of petitioner's

16

misconduct could not change the historical fact that by

17

then there had already been a violation of the act, so the

18

only remaining question is what the appropriate remedy is

19

for that violation, and that's governed by 29 U.S.C.

20

section 626, which authorizes district courts to grant

21

such legal and equitable relief as may be appropriate to

22

effectuate the purposes of the act.

23

QUESTION:

All right.

Then how is it -- imagine

24

the employee is dismissed on day 1, because of age.

25

employer says, you're too old.

I'm firing you.

MR. GORNSTEIN:

2

That's my question.

It would

seem in that circumstance, contrary to the Sixth Circuit,

that the employee should get paid for the first 10 months

5

before they found it, perhaps, but why the next 14?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

Our answer to that is, and I

think this is the question is which of those two rules

8

best advances the purposes of the statute, and we think

9

that the rule that you - - the backpay ends on the date on

11

directly from this Court's decision in Albemarle.
QUESTION:

12

It's easy to administer that kind of rule, and

11

your rule is difficult, as Justice O'Connor pointed out.
MR. GORNSTEIN:

12

I think that the virtue of the

13

date of discovery rule is that it's easier to administer,

they did, and no evidence, absolutely no evidence came

forward to show that.

21

It's a finding of fact, uncontradicted in the

been aware of, but it comes out during the course of the

6

trial that this employee is really grossly incompetent,

7

would that in your view lead to the same conclusion, that

no recovery could be had for firing this employee because

9

of race, or sex, or age?

MR. WAYLAND:
conclusion, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

15

MR. WAYLAND:

It may well lead to that
I think --

I know it may well.

I want to know what your answer is.
Well, I think it would depend upon

16

the employer.

The test that we submit. Your Honor, is

17

applicable is, are there undisputed facts, is that --

18

would that be an objective reason for discharge, and can

19

the company prove it would have terminated the employee --

MR. WAYLAND:

had the employer known about it?

2

MR. WAYLAND:

That's correct, Your Honor.

The

3

statute says, good cause.

4

but it says good cause, and in enacting the discrimination

5

laws and the Age Discrimination Act, Congress was very

6

sensitive to the employer's right to exercise its

7

legitimate prerogatives except for when --a

8

discriminatory motive - -

QUESTION:

10
11
12

It doesn't define good cause,

So I gather --

MR. WAYLAND:

-- that resulted in an injury.

Excuse me.
QUESTION:

-- if you bring a suit under this

13

statute you better expect your employment history to be

14

very carefully scrutinized not only for intentional

15

misdeeds but for general incompetence?

16

MR. WAYLAND:

17

QUESTION:

18

Yes, Your Honor.

And that would be rather risky,

wouldn't it, to bring such a suit?

19

MR. WAYLAND:

20

QUESTION:

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

Even if the employer is unable to

21

establish the general incompetence, it would make good

22

reading for any subsequent employer, wouldn't it?

23
24
25

MR. WAYLAND:

Well, Your Honor, I guess there's

protective orders that would deal with that.
But the point, Your Honor, is that the -- you

look at the conduct and what the employer would have done,

2

and whether or not that rises to the level of actual

3

discrimination.

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Wayland, I would have

thought you would look at the situation at the time the

6

employment action occurred, and that's what Congress was

trying to prevent.

discharge, based on the employee's race or sex or age, and

9

they're trying to discourage that kind of action, so I

They don't want employment action, a

10

don't see how your rule implements the goal of the statute

11

at all.

12

MR. WAYLAND:

Well, Your Honor, it's also a goal

13

of the statute not to reward bad employees, and if you buy

14

the plaintiff's theory, if you ignore the fact of the

15

misconduct that would have resulted in their termination,

15

then the result is you are rewarding an employee for their

17

stealth and for the concealment of their misconduct.

QUESTION:

Well, not if you look at it, for

example, as of the date of the acquisition of the

subsequent knowledge.

MR. WAYLAND:

Then it looks to me like you can

Well, the employee is still being

rewarded, Your Honor, because that's going to, employees

3

discovery process.

4

What we submit --

5

QUESTION:

It might also, we submit,

Mr. Wayland, let me put it this way.

6

This is a statute that says, thou shalt not discriminate.

7

As you describe this scenario, you are turning that around

8

and say, well, let's just assume that, arguendo, this case

9

is going to be about whether this was an inadequate

10

employee.
And you have turned what Congress set up as a

11
12

discrimination claim into something where the

13

discrimination claim never even sees the light of day

14

unless the employee can first survive this hurdle of

15

showing that she would have kept the job that she was a

16

competent employee, that she had not engaged in any

17

misconduct, so it seems to me just destructive of the

18

claim that Congress set up when it passed these

19

antidiscrimination laws.
MR. WAYLAND:

20

The question, Your Honor, is to

21

relief.

22

who could prove a violation is going to get a remedy.

This Court has recognized this in Albemarle Paper case.

Just that much.

MR. WAYLAND:

Your Honor, this Court, under my

5

reading of the statute, would have the discretion to award

6

that if it found that that was appropriate, and that would

7

certainly be consistent with what Congress has enacted in

8

the 1991 Civil Rights Act.

9
10
11

QUESTION:

Then how can you give summary

judgment and not even have that proof in the case?
MR. WAYLAND:

Well, Your Honor, we submit that

12

in the cases that we're dealing with when we're dealing

13

with misconduct serious enough to warrant discharge, that

14

would have warranted discharge, that that ends the

15

inquiry, because the -- that conduct becomes a superseding

16

cause for any injury.

17

redressability question comes into play.

18

QUESTION:

There's no relief, or the

You're running two theories,

19

Mr. Wayland, and I think you're going to have to pick

20

between them.

21

One is that there's simply no cause of action

22

because there's been no harm done, and if you run that

23

theory, you do, indeed, have to answer my earlier question

24

about whether even an incompetent employee is not entitled

25

to relief, the way you did.

Incompetence, just like

1

intentional misdoing, eliminates the cause of action.

2

But there is a second theory which you seem to

3

be running in your discussion with Justice Ginsburg, and

4

that is, it doesn't go to whether there's a claim at the

5

outset, but to whether relief is appropriate, and under

6

that theory you could get a declaratory judgment.

7

there's no basis for a declaratory judgment under your

8

first theory, that there's simply no cause of action.

9

That is, no harm has been done.

10

MR. WAYLAND:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. WAYLAND:

13

first theory is the correct one.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

But

That is correct, Your Honor.

Well, which theory do you want?
Well, we would submit that the

That's what I thought your brief

contained, the first theory, not the remedial theory.
MR. WAYLAND:

But if the Court determines that

17

there is a violation, then we think you have to go to the

18

remedial theory as a -- a, for lack of a better term, a

19

fail-back position, and that's certainly appropriate then.

20

QUESTION:

I thought your starting point is, we

21

can concede the violation.

You have no claim if you

22

engage in the kind of misconduct that would have led to

23

your termination anyway.

24

is, we can concede arguendo that there was age

25

discrimination, but it doesn't matter, because you don't

MR. WAYLAND:

3

Your Honor, the teachings of this

Court in the Price Waterhouse case is there are three

5

things that are necessary for a legally cognizable injury

6

under the discrimination law.

7

There has to be a bad motive, which we are

assuming for purposes of argument here, there has to be an

action pursuant to that bad motive, and there has to be an

injury.

Now, that's the

I had not understood the Price

14

Waterhouse decision to involve the scenario here, that is,

15

that there is never any proof of discrimination because we

16

go right to the defense.

17

MR. WAYLAND:

The difference between the Price

18

Waterhouse scenario and this one, Your Honor, in the

19

abstract, we submit, is that in Price Waterhouse both

20

motives were present at the same time, whereas in this

21

case by definition the after-acquired knowledge was not

22

present at the time the decision was made, but once you

Legal injury has got to be defined in

That is the legal injury, and if

there has been a discharge because of age, it seems to me

just a second?

Mr. Wayland, could I interrupt for

I want to get one thought on the table.

3

Isn't it true that in the orderly presentation

of a trial the plaintiff puts her evidence in first, she

puts in the evidence that she was a loyal employee, she

6

was fired, fired because of age, and she lost her job.

7

Prima facie, she has established injury, and she rests.

8

Nobody says anything about this that's found out later.

9

Then, in your case, you put this evidence on,

10

but is it not true that at the time she completes her

11

case, she has established injury, and then you come up

12

with an affirmative defense, trying to say, well, you

really didn't get hurt.

when the thing turns up, or run to 2 years because it

2

wouldn't have turned up in the absence of this case.

3

That's what I'd appreciate your addressing, you

4

see, because you could make the same argument about not

5

subjecting people to inquisitions.

permit that employer to stop his damages once he finds out

this thing on discovery, that also would encourage

inquisitions.

MR. WAYLAND:

If you're going to

anything suggests --

I don't think

I'm asking you to address the point

14

of when, in your opinion, if you lost on your main point,

the damages would be stopped, and why.

16

MR. WAYLAND:

The answer to that question, Your

17

Honor, is the damages should be stopped as of the time

18

that the employee engaged in the misconduct, or the

19

alleged injury occurred, so it would be the time of the

20

lay-off, because otherwise what the court is doing is

21

rewarding an employee for their misconduct.

QUESTION:

assumption that you lose on that point.

I'm making the assumption that for

1

argument's sake that our choice is between stopping it at

2

the time the employer discovers it, or letting the damages

3

run, despite the discovery, until judgment enters.
Now, you don't have to address that, because you

4
5

might say, since that whole assumption's wrong and so

6

forth -- I understand that, but if you want to address

7

that, I'd appreciate it.
MR. WAYLAND:

8

9

Your Honor, on your assumption,

then the damages should stop when the employer learned of

10

the misconduct, because if not, then this Court is

11

ignoring the teachings of Mount Healthy and its progeny

12

that a plaintiff should not be better off because they

13

raise a discrimination claim.

14

If we had found out about Ms. McKennon's

15

misconduct in another lawsuit, or some employee came

16

forward and spilled the beans on her, or she became, at a

17

party one night she let it slip what she had done, then

18

nobody, I think, would seriously argue that we could not

19

have acted at that time.
What the Government and the plaintiff argued is

20
21

that because this came out in discovery, which was a

22

result of her exercising her right to bring a civil

23

action, that we are precluded from relying on it at that

24

time.

1

than they would have been otherwise solely because they

2

filed a discrimination claim, and that is not what the law

3

of this Court says is the law of the land.

4

answer it would be, once the employer finds out about it,

5

damages stops, the end.

6

So in that

We would note that the EEOC has taken the

7

position that initially that there were no damages, that

8

the only thing the court could - - would award would be

9

declaratory relief and backpay.

10

Then they went to the position of saying it

11

stopped when the employer found out about it, and now if I

12

understand what they're saying, it goes on ad inf -- until

13

there's a judgment, unless we could prove metaphysically

14

somehow that we would have found out about it otherwise,

and I think here we concede that there's no way we would

have known about this misconduct.

dismiss them.

2

You have such a case, and the plaintiff copies

3

certain confidential documents, just what happened here.

4

Would you say even then there is no claim for relief, even

5

if you had the clearest, wilful violation of the statute?
MR. WAYLAND:

6

If the employer could prove, Your

7

Honor, that it would have terminated her absent the

8

illegal intent, if it would have taken the same action

o

based upon the stealing of the confidential documents,

10

then the answer is yes, she would not have a claim for

11

relief under the discrimination laws, and that is the

12

teaching of this Court in the plurality opinion in Price

13

Waterhouse, that's the teaching of the principle in Mount

14

Healthy, and that's what this Court has recognized over

15

and over again.

16

Turning to the relief aspect, Your Honor --

17

QUESTION:

18

How do you -- can you just explain

one thing that I don't understand clearly?

19

In the Mount Healthy setting, in the Price

20

Waterhouse setting, you have the plaintiff putting on a

case.

22

That was not happening in Mount Healthy, it was

others like it, the plaintiff never makes a prima facie

We never have that showing.
That's something different, and would you

explain to me why, in the Mount Healthy setting, in the

Price Waterhouse setting, you do have the plaintiff's

case, and then the answer to it.

and we just assume the case.

MR. WAYLAND:

Here, we have the answer

Well, Your Honor, I suspect

because in those cases there were disputes of fact that
required a trial.

10

In your hypothetical, the existence of that

11

smoking gun memo may well be sufficient to create a

12

question of fact that would then go to the jury as to,

13

would the company have in fact put aside the

14

discriminatory motive and done the same thing anyway?

15

that circumstance, then certainly a trial may be

16

appropriate.

17

In

We're not suggesting that summary judgment is

always appropriate in these cases, but where there are no

1

disputed facts, and as a matter of law, we submit that we

20

should be entitled to a valid defense because of the

21

employee's misconduct.

22

The employee has no one to blame but themselves.

23

Any denial of a remedy or relief is a result of their own

24

misconduct.

the discrimination laws should be used to benefit

employees who were bad applies.
QUESTION:

Are you saying, then, if you don't

3

have a summary judgment case on the defense, then under

4

your theory, suppose the employer says, objectively there

5

were grounds for discharging her but there's a dispute

6

whether they would in fact have, could, in your view of

7

this kind of case, the trial judge say, well, I'm going to

8

have a trial on that, because if I find that they would

9

have fired her for a reason for which they could have

10

fired her, I save everybody a lot of time, because that's

11

totally dispositive?

12

13
14

MR. WAYLAND:

Yes, Your Honor.

That's exactly

what the Court could do.
QUESTION:

So you could do the same thing in

15

Price Waterhouse, and the same thing in the Mount Healthy

16

setting as well?

17

19

MR. WAYLAND:

I'm sorry, Your Honor, I did not

hear the second - QUESTION:

In the Mount Healthy type case, the

20

mixed motive case, you could do the very same thing, say,

21

I'm going to have a trial on the defense first, and we'll

22

never have a trial on the discrimination part because that

23

becomes irrelevant?

24
25

MR. WAYLAND:

The Court certainly could do that

in handling the case, Your Honor.

We submit, and I think

we put forth in our brief and one of our amicus submits,

2

this is in the form of an affirmative defense of the

3

employer.

4

The employer has the burden of proving that

5

there was misconduct that objectively would have resulted

in termination, and subjectively it would have resulted in

7

termination.

8

undisputed facts on summary judgment or in a trial, then

9

that provides a defense.

If they can establish that either through

QUESTION:

10

Of course, in terms of what is

11

properly disputed, isn't it a relevant fact in determining

12

whether they would have discharged that they are coming

13

forward with this evidence and they are trying to prove

14

this we assume, for the sake of argument, after they have

15

violated the statute, so isn't the fact of the statutory

16

violation always going to be relevant except in a case in

17

which it's stipulated that they would have discharged

18

anyway?

19
20

MR. WAYLAND:

Well, Your Honor, it's relevant

but it's not determinative.

21

QUESTION:

It's the same thing as in --

No, but it simply goes to the

22

question whether you can, in fact, litigate solely your

23

affirmative defense, and it seems to me that in the

24

case --

25

there would have been a discharge absent the

except in a case in which it is stipulated that

discrimination, you really cannot so divide the issues,

2

because the one is relevant to your determination under

3

the other.
MR. WAYLAND:

4

Well, Your Honor, I think the

5

better practice probably would be to have a trial on the

6

merits with this being an affirmative defense, but it's

7

similar to going to the qualification requirement of a

8

plaintiff.

judgment?

QUESTION:

But didn't you move for summary

Then you couldn't have thought that.

11

MR. WAYLAND:

12

QUESTION:

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

You moved for summary judgment on the

13

basis of an affirmative defense.

14

MR. WAYLAND:

15
16

That's correct, Your Honor.

Just - QUESTION:

But you -- so -- but you think the

17

better practice would have been to reject your motion and

13

say well, let's have a trial first and then decide it?

19

MR. WAYLAND:

No, Your Honor.

If I understood

20

Justice Souter's question, it went to if there was a

21

question of intent of violation, wouldn't that be wrapped

22

up in this whole question of what you would have done, and

23

I'm saying that I think the better aspect would be if the

24

company cannot prove on the basis of undisputed facts and

25

summary judgment, then the entire case goes to trial,

rather than bifurcating the trial just for this issue and

2

then holding the liability issue later.
But if this is proven, if it's proven that the

3
4

after-acquired evidence would have resulted in the

5

person's termination, was sufficient for that, then that

6

is a valid defense.

7

You have to - - again, I think what the courts

8

have said that have adopted this bar to relief, as you

9

look at the remedy, you look at the claim of injury, and

10

then you look at the relief that they're requesting.
The claim of injury in a wrongful discharge case

11
12

is that they were terminated, and they've lost wages and

13

benefits.

14

misconduct serves to cut the legs out from under that

15

claim, because it is also a result, or results in that

16

injury, and the plaintiff has no one to blame for

17

theirselves.

18

That's the relief: that's available, and the

On-the-job misconduct, whether it was fact at

19

the time, whether the employer knew it at the time or not,

20

is relevant, and it's properly considered by this Court.

We submit that if you ignore this evidence it would be

22

impractical.

This is not something where there is a blanket

bar.

QUESTION:

1

One of the facts of this case, I

2

guess, is no matter how serious your misconduct was, and

3

we assume, of course, it was serious enough to justify

4

discharge, it didn't cause any pecuniary damage to the

5

employer.

6

MR. WAYLAND:

7

QUESTION:

8

That it did not, Your Honor?

It did not cause any pecuniary, not

even a nickel of damages to the employer.

9

MR. WAYLAND:

I don't think it would be any

10

provable damages to the employer, Your Honor.

11

like she stole money.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. WAYLAND:

It's not

No.
I think there was certainly an

14

injury and a damage to the employer, but I don't know

that's something they could recover for.

She just told her husband some

MR. TERRY:

Justice Ginsburg,

there are

questions of fact in this case.
My client worked there 40 years.

The affidavit

signed by the publisher in December, where he said he

would have fired her on March 6th,

9

later in his deposition, he could not identify the

documents that were taken.
My client worked there 40 years.

She was
