We'll hear argument

this morning in Case 06-984, Medellin v. Texas.

Mr. Donovan.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD F. DONOVAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. DONOVAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The President and the Senate entered into

11

three treaties, the Optional Protocol, the UN Charter,

12

and the ICJ Statute, by which the United States agreed

13

that it would comply with the ICJ's decision in any case

14

to which it was a party.

15

and the President of the United States has determined

16

that the United States should comply.

17

We now have such a decision,

Texas, however, tells this Court that it

18

should tell the world that the framers left us a

19

Constitution in which neither this Court nor the

20

President nor maybe even Congress could ensure that the

21

United States kept the promise that its elected

22

representatives made to its treaty partners.

23

position is directly contrary to the constitutional

24

design.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Texas's

That's not such an
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

outrageous proposition.

You'd certainly acknowledge

2

that the President and the Senate could not enter into a

3

treaty that required the States to do something that was

4

unconstitutional.

5

MR. DONOVAN:

Yes.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The Constitution -

So there would be the

7

situation that presents the shocking situation you've

8

just described.

9

cannot be enforced domestically.

10

There is a treaty, but nonetheless it

MR. DONOVAN:

There would be constitutional

11

-- there might be affirmative constitutional constraints

12

on the enforcement of a treaty, but there are none here.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Who would enforce

14

those constraints?

15

your position is that it seems to leave no role for this

16

Court in interpreting treaties as a matter of Federal

17

law.

18

The thing that concerns me about

Suppose, for example, that the International

19

Court of Justice determined in this case its judgment

20

was the same, but they added:

21

deterrence, we think the officers who failed to give

22

consular warning should each be sentenced to 5 years in

23

jail.

24

have a role in reviewing that judgment?

25

As a matter of

That's the ICJ determination.

MR. DONOVAN:

Would this Court

This Court would have a role

in reviewing that judgment, and here's -- here's the

2

question.

3

authority, to say what the law is.

4

obligation is, in fact, to comply with the judgment,

5

itself.

6
7

This Court has an obligation, has the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In this case the

Even if we determine

--

8

MR. DONOVAN:

And if that obligation -

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Even if we

10

determine, even if we determine that that judgment is

11

based on a legal error?

12

MR. DONOVAN:

The question -- that's the

13

basis of submitting a dispute to a third-party

14

dispute-resolution mechanism, yes.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if the ICJ

16

determined that the officers should each go to jail for

17

5 years, we would have no basis for reviewing that

18

judgment?

19

MR. DONOVAN:

Wel, that would be -- well,

20

that would be a -- raise a separate obstacle.

21

answer the questions in turn, first -

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If I may

Does the ICJ ever issue a

23

judgment of that character?

It issues a judgment

24

between two nations, two or more nations, and it is

25

instructs the United States to do something.
5
Alderson Reporting Company

I'm not

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

aware of any -- any decision of the ICJ that says what a

2

sentence should be for a particular individual.

3

MR. DONOVAN:

That is correct.

The ICJ

4

decides disputes between nations, but those disputes may

5

involve the nations' obligation as to specific

6

individuals. In this case -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

in the answer to the Chief Justice's hypothetical.

10
11
12
13

Well, I'm still interested

MR. DONOVAN:

Well, as I say, there are two

-JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose the court acts

beyond, clearly beyond, its jurisdiction?
MR. DONOVAN: Well, it's -- with respect,

14

there's no suggestion here that the court has acted

15

beyond its jurisdiction.

16

determined otherwise.

17
18
19

Indeed, the President has

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could you answer the

hypothetical, please.
MR. DONOVAN:

But if the court, itself -- if

20

the ICJ, itself, made a determination as to a dispute

21

that is within its jurisdiction and that imposes an

22

obligation that is within this Court's provenance to

23

enforce, that is, that it determines the rights

24

attributable -- enforceable within a court of justice,

25

this Court would be enforcing the obligation to comply.

Alderson Reporting Company

It wouldn't -- the fact that it diverged

2

from the court's own interpretation, for example, here

3

in Sanchez-Llamas, is not relevant to the treaty

4

obligation that this Court is exercising -

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry.

I'm

6

still looking for an answer to the hypothetical.

7

would be the basis for this Court's reviewing the ICJ's

8

determination that officers should go to jail for 5

9

years?

10

MR. DONOVAN:

What

Because in that situation that

11

may be beyond the Court's -- the executive power of the

12

Court.

13

the rights attributable to -

What the Court would be doing is determining

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The Court doesn't

15

have executive power.

16

already exercised that judicial power in Sanchez-Llamas

17

in determing the meaning of this treaty.

18

It has judicial power.

It's

And I understood your position to be that we

19

have no authority to construe the treaty in this case

20

because a judgment was issued by the International Court

21

of Justice.

22

MR. DONOVAN:

The -- the question here is

23

that the --the Court would be exercising its judicial

24

authority to construe the United States's obligation to

25

comply with the judgment.

The nature of that
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

obligation, itself, could be one that would be

2

enforceable, in this Court's words, "in a court of

3

justice;" and that's the nature of this obligation.

4

Medellin gets a review and reconsideration.

5

Mr.

In the Chief Justice's hypothetical, that

6

may well be an obligation that would be enforceable by

7

other actors that would -- which would not be directly

8

enforceable in a court as here.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

MR. DONOVAN:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

I thought -

It depends on the nature of I thought the question -

12

and I apologize if I'm not paraphrasing it because I

13

have my own.

14

a treaty, and that treaty binds all the member nations,

15

and supreme courts of various nations have come up

16

against this problem:

17

This has arisen frequently.

Brussels has

What would happen if the Brussels court or

18

the EU court insists under the treaty that we do

19

something that violates our own Constitution?

20

this is an example of that.

21

has been:

22

least if it was a violation, what the EU said, of

23

fundamental human rights or destroyed some basic

24

structural part of our Constitution.

25

I think

And the answer typically

Well, we'd follow our own Constitution, at

And the question that I would have is,
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

doesn't that kind of approach -- not exactly but that

2

kind of approach -- satisfy whatever problem there is in

3

this respect here?

4

MR. DONOVAN:

If there were -- if an ICJ -

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

If the ICJ were to do

6

something which it had never done, like, say, put

7

everybody in jail for 50 years -- I don't know that

8

there is such a thing -- but suppose they did, if they

9

did, I guess that might violate something basic in our

10

Constitution, in which case we wouldn't enforce it.

11

MR. DONOVAN:

That's right and -

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

MR. DONOVAN:

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If we took that approach Now -

If there Just to get back,

16

you're conceding, I take it, whether the ICJ has done

17

something like this before or not -- and we can debate

18

whether what they've done in this case is precisely that

19

-- there is a role for this Court in determining whether

20

or not a judgment of the ICJ should be enforced.

21

MR. DONOVAN:

There is surely because it's

22

this Court that would be enforcing the obligation to

23

comply.

24
25

And just as a treaty cannot contravene an CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Just enforcing the

obligation to comply or, as we have in this case,
9
Alderson Reporting Company

determining the legal basis for the ICJ determination?

2

MR. DONOVAN:

There are -- there are two

3

different obligations here:

There is an obligation

under the Vienna Convention itself, and this Court has

5

determined the dispositive effect of that obligation of

a matter of U.S. law.

7

obligation.

8

9

Justice, to resolve disputes.

But there's a different

The President and the Senate agree to go to

The very premise of that

10

obligation is that we might disagree with the

11

determination -- with the interpretation of the treaty,

12

and we agreed in that circumstance to comply with the -

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose in this case the

14

President did the opposite -- the same facts only the

15

President said to Texas, do not comply with this

16

judgment.

17

MR. DONOVAN:

Well, it -- that would -- it

would be inconsistent with this Court's duty and

obligation to comply, to enforce a treaty that the -

that the -

And you say he can't do that.

MR. DONOVAN:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

My hypothetical is he's

If And I -- I think that

that's not -- not consistent with your earlier position.
MR. DONOVAN:

Oh, if the President here -

10

the -- if there's an obligation here to comply and, in

11

the words this Court, it's "an obligation of a nature to

12

be enforced in a court of justice," and here the

13

obligation imposed by the ICJ and the Avena judgment is

14

an -- is an obligation -

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

16

MR. DONOVAN:

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Isn't the obligation -- which essentially Isn't the obligation that

18

the United States undertook when it signed the UN

19

Charter the obligation to undertake to comply with ICJ

20

judgments in accordance with its own constitutional

21

processes, not necessarily that any ICJ decision would

22

be regarded by any court in this country as binding

MR. DONOVAN:
that's exactly right.

Well, it would be -- that -

What the -- what the ICJ -- what

what is the nature of the obligation imposed?

So the question is,

If you had a -

It might have obligations If you had a treaty on

Are you saying that this undertaking, this

15

full faith and credit?

That's exactly the effect of

You don't really need

Well, if the -- whether or not

the treaty obligation is self-executing or

self-enforcing goes to the nature of the obligation.

2

the ICJ said -- if a treaty or an ICJ judgment said, go

3

pass a statute, that's obviously directed to Congress.

4

If it said cease hostilities, that's directed to the

5

President.

or, by extension, a treaty obligation to comply with a

judgment is -

But as this Court has said, when a treaty

May I -

-- of a nature to be enforced

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May ask this question?

I

12

don't think you've answered the Chief Justice's original

hypothetical.

us to violate our Constitution by a judgment of their

15

kind.

16

the sentence for this man should be 5 years, not just

17

there be an investigation to see if he's been

prejudiced.

19
20

It's easy, of course; they cannot compel

But what about the hypothetical that they said

Would we have to follow that judgment?
MR. DONOVAN:

Well, in that situation, if it

was a judgment rendered in a case to which we had -

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

22

MR. DONOVAN:

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

In this very case.

That would be This very case.

Supposing

24

they had said the judgment is that Medellin should spend

25

5 years in jail and no more.

Would we have to honor

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that judgment?

2

MR. DONOVAN:

In the first instance, yes,

3

the Court would honor that judgment as an obligation to

4

comply.

But remember that there are -

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

MR. DONOVAN:

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then it becomes -

-- some constraints that Then it becomes a penal

8

judgment, and I thought the rule was that no country

9

forces -- enforces another country's penal judgment.

10
11

MR. DONOVAN:

Well, that would depend on the

-- if -- how you construed the obligation to comply.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

MR. DONOVAN:

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15
16

But if we say -

In this case, we have -- this man goes to jail

for 5 years, it seems to me that's a penal judgment.
MR. DONOVAN:

If that was the nature of the

17

dispute that the United -- that is, of course, not the

18

nature of the dispute that the United States -

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

20

MR. DONOVAN:

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if they say But if he -- he goes to jail for no

22

time at all?

They say that the remedy for these

23

violations, in order to deter future violations, should

24

be that the charges should be dismissed and any future

25

prosecution should be barred.

Would that be

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

automatically binding?
MR. DONOVAN:

Well, the question is, is it

3

binding in the first instance because the -- there's an

4

obligation to comply?

5

for example, Congress's ability to repudiate that

6

obligation to comply, just like it has the obligation -

7

the authority as a last-in-time rule, pursuant to the

8

last-in-time rule, to repudiate any treaty obligation.

9

But the framers wanted treaties to be enforced in the

10

first instance when they were susceptible of judicial

11

enforcement, and if the ICJ renders a judgment pursuant

12

to our treaty obligation to submit disputes, that is of

13

a nature to be judicially enforced, then the Court -

That doesn't say anything about,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is the answer to -

-- would be exercising Is the answer to

either my or Justice Stevens's hypothetical then, yes,

we do have to enforce an ICJ judgment of that sort?

19

MR. DONOVAN:

You would enforce an ICJ

20

judgment that did in fact -- that was of a nature to be

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -

15

MR. DONOVAN:

a Federal procedural rule that preempts a State

Federal rule all the time.

prescribe rules of decision that preempt Federal rules

5

and require the cases that other -- that would not

otherwise be heard to be heard. That's -

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, you're -- you're -

8

as I understand it, in order for you to prevail on that

9

point, the only -- the only conclusion that has to be

10

drawn, as I understand it, is that the Texas courts have

11

subject matter jurisdiction of this kind of -- of order,

12

and that the bar that Texas is asserting is simply, in

13

effect, a procedural bar; and, therefore, in order for

14

this Federal rule to preempt the State bar is not to

15

give the State courts jurisdiction they don't have, but

16

to remove a bar to the exercise of their jurisdiction

17

that State law, absent preemption, would impose; is that

18

correct?

19
20

MR. DONOVAN:

That's correct.

That's right.

It removes a bar by preempting that bar.

there's an enforceable obligation -

whether we're going to default on our international law

determination in every case.

That's different than the ICJ's

Is that -- does that have the same status as
the memorandum here?
GENERAL CLEMENT:

I would say that it

18

wouldn't -- I would say that it wouldn't, as you

19

suggest, not fully comply and not fully discharge with

20

our obligation.

21

But the extent to which we did and purported

22

to be doing that under compliance with the judgment, it

23

would have the same force as providing the rule of

decision, which, to get back to Justice Scalia's

25

question, especially in a context like this, is not so
27

2

the President supplies the rule of decision in the

sovereign immunity.

It is not materially different from when

JUSTICE ALITO:

If we agree with you, would

7

the effect be that the President can take any treaty

8

that is ratified on the understanding that it's not

9

self-executing and execute the treaty and give it force

10

under domestic law?

GENERAL CLEMENT:

No, Justice Alito, I don't

think the theory would sweep that broadly, and I think

that -

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, why would it not?

15

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, first of all,

16

there's obviously a limiting principle in our theory,

which is to say that the President can't take any action

18

pursuant to this which is inconsistent with other

19

constitutional obligations.

take action that's inconsistent with the determination

think that reflects that self-executing is one of those

words that people use to cover a lot of different

meanings; and I think in its most correct sense, you're

25

right to say that the Vienna Convention is
30

So there didn't have to be legislation

3

before Texas and its local officials were obligated to

President can't displace the role of this Court.

15

just that the role of this Court in a situation where

16

there's been a judgment and the executive branch has

17

viewed that judgment as something we should comply with,

18

then the role of this Court is limited to deciding

19

whether there was jurisdiction to issue that judgment in

20

the first place; and then the secondary role of this

21

Court would to be to say, does the rule of law embodied

22

by that judgment violate the Constitution.

Yes.

Let me try one other

variation to make sure that I understand your argument.

11

What if the President of the United States had said this

judgment, the Avena judgment, will not be enforced, and

13

this Court interpreted the Avena judgment as binding, as

14

providing a rule of decision and a rule of decision

15

which was entitled to respect by Texas?

16

Would this Court's authority to make that

17

declaration and issue a judgment to that effect be

18

displaced by the President's determination that it would

19

not be that the Avena judgment would not be enforced?

20

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Of course not, Justice

21

Souter.

That would just be like cases that

22

unfortunately happen, where we would take a position

So -- but we do think, we

stick to our view that the President's role here makes

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The entirety of the United States's argument

is predicated on the idea that the President's

24

Federal law.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

the argument, but your brother the Solicitor General has

conceded that if we take the position in this case that

3

there is a -- a rule of decision that should be

4

respected in this Court and, hence, the subject of a

judgment to Texas that, among other things, would

There's no doubt, if the Court

decided it on the ground that Avena was a binding
judgment, the President's order would be unnecessary.
I would note the United States strenuously

12

disagrees with that proposition.

13

United States explicitly disclaims these treaties as the

14

source of his authority; in fact, expressly agrees with

15

this Court's decision in Sanchez-Llamas.

JUSTICE BREYER:

And, indeed, the

Maybe you could spend a

minute explaining that, because, as I read the

be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every

Then this is consistent

with what you've been explaining to Justice Breyer in

10

your answer, that for 200 years we have had some

11

treaties that are very important, but they're not

12

self-executing; their violation may put us in violation

13

of international law; but it is for us to determine how

14

we are going to comply with the international

15

obligation; and there is no obligation on the part of

16

the State to comply with that law because it's not

self-executing.

correct.

the Vienna Convention itself is or is not

self-executing.

24

correct in saying that that's a difficult word.

25

it is self-executing in that the State has to comply

I think the Solicitor General was

50
Alderson Reporting Company

I think

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

with it.
I'm not sure that it is self-executing in

3

that the State has to accept whatever procedural

4

framework the foreign national demands.

5

MR. CRUZ:

I would agree with the

6

characterization you suggest, which is that the Vienna

7

Convention was self-executing in the sense that it

8

didn't require legislation to go into effect, but it was

9

not self-executing in the sense that it provided

10
11

judicially cognizable rights.
But let me add a caveat to that, which is in

12

both Breard and Sanchez-Llamas, this Court assumed the

13

Vienna Convention created individual rights, and

14

although Texas maintains that it did not create

15

individual rights and the United States maintains that

16

it did not create individual rights, we don't have to

17

win on that proposition to prevail in this case.

18

assuming it created individual rights in this case,

19

Medellin defaulted on that claim and this Court held

20

with Sanchez-Llamas that procedural default is

21

consistent with the treaty.

22

Even

And the real question here in this case,

23

particularly with respect to the President's order, is

24

whether the Optional Protocol is self-executing, the

25

decision of the Avena court, or, as a subsequent matter,
51

1

whether the President has some sort of independent

authority to make Federal law.

And in this respect -

7

any two parties that can agree, can have a formed

of this tribunal, and then it follows from that that if

you accept their authority to adjudicate, you are bound

11

to follow its decisions.

13

that even though there are cases like Nicaragua and

nations that agree to submit to the jurisdiction of that

16

tribunal?

17

MR. CRUZ:

It -- was

Justice Ginsburg, that is correct

18

as a political and diplomatic matter, but in my judgment

19

it speaks volumes that of the 166 nations that signed on

20

to the Vienna Convention and of the 50 nations that

21

signed on to the Optional Protocol, zero -- not a single

22

nation -- treats ICJ judgments as binding in their

domestic courts.

25

What Petitioners are arguing here is for an
interpretation of this treaty that no other nation

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. CRUZ:

Maybe it hasn't come up.

Given that these treaties are

four decades old, that that speaks volumes that no -- no

3

MR. CRUZ:

But the ICJ's decision -- I think

4

your question goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question

5

about the effect of an ICJ decision.

6

The legal -- legal adviser to the State

7

Department told the Senate, when it was ratifying the UN

8

Charter, that decisions of the ICJ are "a moral

9

obligation" and there is "no provision" for the

10

enforcement of such decisions.

11

example of this is the entire debate over the Connally

12

Amendment.

13

legislative history, and it's an argument back and forth

14

about whether it is wise to require the United States to

15

cast a veto in the Security Council over an attempt to

16

enforce an ICJ.

17

U.S. Senate suggested the proposition that ICJ decisions

18

might be independently enforceable.

19

that understood it that way.

20

there is no problem.

I think it belongs in this

And when you have a non-self-executing treaty,

It becomes U.S. law when the Senate and the

10

House pass a law which the president -- it doesn't

11

become U.S. law because the President writes a

12

memorandum to his Attorney General, but it does become

13

U.S. law when a law is enacted.

14

MR. CRUZ:

And that -

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That solves the

16

constitutional problem, but in the situation we're

17

talking about here, I don't know on what basis we can

MR. CRUZ:

The WTO and NAFTA -- I mean NAFTA

deal with the application of facts to a particular

8

purporting to bind the United States on this is what the

underlying Federal law means.

10
11

It's not interpreting the treaty and

It's a congressional agreement, but it

MR. CRUZ:

Right.

Right.

And it could

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You have three different

things that you have to tell us about today:

That the

16

President's authority, the effect of the ICJ, and -- and

17

the Avena judgment, and ultimately, the force of the

18

Vienna Convention itself.

19

And the only question I have that I need

20

your help with is as to the last, and I hope that it

21

doesn't interrupt the train of your argument.

22

I think the ICJ -- pardon me, the Vienna

23

Convention is self-executing, in that it requires the

24

States to conform to the consular notification

25

provision.
57
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. CRUZ:

And we don't disagree with that.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose you have a judge

3

who has control over a defendant who's being held in

4

custody pending trial, and the defendant says I want to

5

see my -- my foreign counsel.

6

you mandate that -- assuming State procedures allow him

7

in, couldn't you mandate that judge to require him to

8

allow the notification to take place?

9

MR. CRUZ:

The judge says no.

Can

The consequence of the argument

10

that it doesn't create individual rights would mean that

11

that individual defendant could not raise it in that -

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

13

MR. CRUZ:

14

And so in that circumstance, it would mean,

15

if a judge declined to comply with that obligation, the

16

individual defendant would not have an appealable legal

17

error.

18

You see where I'm going?

Yes.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If I thought he did, would

19

I still have to rule against you?

20

MR. CRUZ:

No, not at all.

In fact, just as

21

this Court did in Breard and Sanchez-Llamas, it assumes

22

that the Vienna Convention created individual rights.

23

And so we don't need to prevail on that to reach the

24

identical outcome.

25

incorrect concerning individual rights, the

Because even assuming we are

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But Could I make a distinction

between failing to let him see the counsel at all in my

hypothetical and a demand that the procedural framework

Isn't there a distinction between those two

MR. CRUZ:

It seems to me some of your reasons actually go to

whether the -- whether it was a correct interpretation

23

of the treaty. And if it were a judgment, would you

agree that this Court would have to accept it, even if

was self-executing, then you would have the height of

21

in that situation, I would submit as a matter of

separation of powers, they could not give this Court's

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But even

Then we couldn't have a

In enforcing foreign judgments,

the foreign court is not purporting to make a definitive

MR. CRUZ:

Justice Ginsburg, it has been the

consistent position of the United States for over four

4

decades from the day this treaty was ratified that the

5

Optional Protocol was not self-executing, was not

6

enforceable in U.S. courts.

that has -- were this Court to treat it as -- as a

judgment, it would be making that treaty self-executing.

And the power to transform a non- -

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So it is not a judgment

I thought you said

11

that -- oh, you said that this is a matter of goodwill

12

or that most ICJ judgments -- ICJ judgments, they're not

13

binding but people comply -- nations comply with them as

14

a matter of goodwill?

62
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the President chose the most logical forum, but what

2

else could he have done?

3

MR. CRUZ:

There are three avenues that the

4

President could have chosen that would have been

5

constitutional.

6

to Congress and proposed a statute amending the AEDPA to

7

allow Federal habeas review.

8
9

The first of which he could have gone

The second is he could have negotiated a
treaty, submitted it -

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Let's start with the

11

first one.

12

It's a state judgment that's in question.

13

Why should this case be in Federal court?

MR. CRUZ:

This Court has made clear that

14

the Federal Government cannot expand the jurisdiction of

15

the State courts.

16

There is a State -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you can have the

17

Federal court overseeing the State court and telling the

18

State what to do?

19

more of an encroachment on State authority than to say,

20

State courts, you do it.

That seems to me practically much

21

MR. CRUZ:

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

23

Well, and -- or to say Federal

courts, you do it.

24

MR. CRUZ:

A corollary -

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

A lot of people think

63
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that's exactly right, that really we expanded Federal

2

habeas jurisdiction quite improperly.

3

every day, doesn't it?

4

MR. CRUZ:

It does.

But it happens

And a corollary to this

5

is if Congress could pass a statute creating a Federal

6

right to review, and that Federal right to review under

7

the principles of Testa versus Katt would have to be

8

respected in the State court.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10
11

Who would be doing the

review?
MR. CRUZ:

Well, if it were a Federal right

12

to review, under Testa versus Katt, both the State and

13

Federal courts would give review.

14

if it were a new Federal right, it would clear the

15

jurisdictional bar because the Texas jurisdictional bar

16

allows an exception for a new law.

17

passed a new law that would be jurisdiction to raise -

18
19
20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Interestingly enough,

So if Congress

A law passed by Congress

saying Texas dispense with your procedural bar rules?
MR. CRUZ:

A law passed by Congress saying

21

in order to give effect to the Avena judgments the 51

22

Mexican nationals at issue shall be entitled to review

23

and reconsideration of whether there was prejudice from

24

the denial of the Vienna Convention. That law would be

25

respected equally.
64
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

I would suggest that Testa versus Katt,

2

which Petitioner uses, is a case which powerfully

3

supports Texas, because the principle of Testa versus

4

Katt was there is one Federal law that must be applied

5

equally in Federal courts and State courts.

6

State courts are not at liberty to ignore Federal law.

7

And the

This is a very curious assertion of

presidential power.

to go it alone, despite a consistent stream of

congressional disapproval, both in ratifying these

treaties and saying they're not self-executing and also

10

in passing the AEDPA.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The not self-executing in

12

the position of the State Department, wasn't there -- in

13

the parallel proceedings in Oklahoma, wasn't there a

14

letter from the current -- the then current legal

15

adviser telling Oklahoma that this is a judgment that's

16

binding on all courts in the United States, State and

Federal, and that the President has directed Oklahoma to

I think that was sent both to the governor and

On page

If that is correct, there is no reason why

the President could not have directed his memorandum to

17

that is an extraordinarily broad power to be asserted on

behalf of the executive.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Cruz, you have

20

frequently emphasized the non-self-executing character

21

of the optional protocol.

22

Is there any rule, any positive rule in

23

existence today either of international law or domestic

24

law that precludes this Court from being the

25

implementing authority as opposed to the executive or
67
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

the executive and the Senate?
MR. CRUZ:

This Court has the final

3

authority to determine what Federal law is, and so if

4

this Court determines that that's what the treaty

5

requires, then that be federal law.

6

that would require overruling -

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Now I would suggest

These treaties including

the optional protocol.
MR. CRUZ:

In my judgment, if the Court

reached that conclusion it would be error.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

But -

I think you misunderstood.

12

I thought he was asking whether if it is -- assuming it

13

is not self-executing, this Court can execute it.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MR. CRUZ:

16

Yeah.

illegitimate for the Court to do so.

17

rule, that the President makes treaties the Senate

advises and consents.

But you're -- my point is,

limitation which you assert, i.e., non-self-executing;

made by this Court?

11

precludes this Court from that role?

judgment it would be usurping the role of Congress.

Because the essence of the decision JUSTICE SOUTER:

disrespectful of your judgment but what do you base it

say if something in this treaty is going to change U.S.

out -- you said that the President was unreasonable in a

sense of saying Texas do that over again -

15

I assume the reason he asked Texas to have

he knew -- that the only hearing they'd had on this

affidavit, and the affidavit said if we had been

contacted, we would have told you not to confess; and we

would have told you to get a lawyer.

excused -- it's in that hearing that I didn't see what

2

4

easiest for Texas to go back to that.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Was the basis for

the determination of no prejudice the fact that the

Petitioner in this case had received full Miranda

Texas Court of Criminal Appeals didn't adopt a simple

solution of the case, to say He got all the protection;

that there's no prejudice and therefore there's no

I agree with you, Justice

Ginsburg, but the United States does not.

And that's part of a

that it is not binding in the sense that the domestic

Indeed, if the ICJ had asserted the power it

claimed to annul U.S. convictions, under the U.S.'s

theory the President presumably could have issued an

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY DONALD F. DONOVAN

19

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

20

MR. DONOVAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

21

First, there is nothing in the ratification

22

history that suggests that Avena made any assumptions

23

about whether or not the Optional Protocol would be

24

self-executing.

25

compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ, and the discussion

The Connally Amendment went to the

79
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to which Texas has referred is entirely about the

2

international ramifications.

3

In fact, the Senate specifically declined to

4

apply the Connally Amendment to the Optional Protocol.

5

So that gets to the question that we have been

6

discussing here, which is:

7

What is the scope of the enforceability of

8

an ICJ judgment?

9

that.

There are obviously constraints to

One is illustrated by the Chief Justice's

10

hypothetical.

11

constraints in the Constitution, itself.

12

That is, there are affirmative

The second is illustrated by a point I made,

13

but Mr. Cruz misunderstood, which is that the nature of

14

the obligation emanating from the judgment is directed

15

at a constitutional branch such as the obligation to

16

enforce an active statute.

17

enforceable in court.

18

Obviously, that is not

If the nature of the obligation is to cease

hostilities, that is obviously directed to the President

21

by the Nicaragua case in which the ICJ issued a

22

judgment.

23

going to comply; and the President said he wasn't going

24

to comply.

25

And that's illustrated

Congress passed a statute that said it wasn't

That, in turn, applies to the third
80
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

constraint, which is the political constraint, itself.

2

The Nicaragua case illustrates that if the ICJ issues a

3

judgment that the United States does not want to comply

4

with, Congress can pass a statute to say we repudiate

5

the obligation.

6

So the obligations that we are talking about

7

here in which the ICJ judgment would be enforceable by

8

an individual fall squarely in the class of cases that

9

this Court has decided for two centuries where an

10

individual has a right conferred by the statute.

11

And he walked into a court, and he asked

12

that court to enforce that right, and he invokes that

13

right in -- as in the Caffa core case, the Roucher case,

14

cases going back to the founding.

15

And this Court has said when the right is of

16

a nature to be enforced in a court of justice, this

17

Court will enforce it.

18

asserting here:

19

eminently suitable for judicial enforcement because it

20

goes to the judicial process, itself.

21

And that is all Mr. Medellin is

The right to enforce a right that is

The second point with respect to Article

22

III:

It cannot be the case that this Court can never

23

enforce -- gives away its Article III authority when

24

25

Comegys and the Abba cases that we have cited that the
81
Alderson Reporting Company

We know from the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Court has in fact said that when the U.S. submits a case

2

to international adjudication that international

3

adjudication is binding and it's not reexaminable in a

4

U.S. court.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I read the Comegys

6

case, however you say it, to be for the exact opposite

7

proposition.

8

international arbitration, there's no reason to go

9

behind it.

10

There they were saying, this is an

But the question of whether or not that

11

arbitration is binding in the bankruptcy proceeding that

12

was at issue there was very much one for the U.S.

13

Supreme Court to make.

14

MR. DONOVAN:

But that's because that was

15

not part of what the court had actually decided, or

16

rather that the international adjudication had actually

17

decided.

Mr. Medellin is entitled to review and reconsideration

as a result of the treaty obligation under 94-1 and the

3

President's determination that that treaty obligation

4

will be given effect, this Court would be performing a

5

supremely judicial function, that is it would be

6

interpreting and applying Federal law in the form of a

7

statute, which is exactly what the Supremacy Clause

8

requests the Court to do.

-- when we're talking about

time and time again is when the obligation is of a

24

nature to be enforced in a court of justice it is

25

directed to the judicial authority.

And what the Court has said

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then what you are saying if

2

I understand you is that Justice Scalia was wrong when

3

he said that would be making it Federal law.

4

you were saying that would be a -- the branch that was

5

responsible for determining how to execute, i.e., to

6

apply, Federal law.

7

I think

Is that your point?

MR. DONOVAN:

That's exactly right.

The

8

thing that makes the treaty Federal law is not the

9

Court; it's the Supremacy Clause, which makes it supreme

10

Federal law.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What is the

12

authority -- I get back to where I started.
