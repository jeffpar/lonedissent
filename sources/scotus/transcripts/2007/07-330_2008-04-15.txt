ORAL ARGUMENT OF AMY HOWE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MS. HOWE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

For over 200 years, this Court has held,

12

without exception, that an appellate court may not

13

modify a judgment in a party's favor unless that party

14

has filed a notice of appeal.

15

has explained, serves important interests in notice and

16

finality.

Such a rule, this Court

17

In 1984, Congress enacted the Sentencing

18

Reform Act against the backdrop of this well settled

19

rule.

20

limited appellate review of sentencing errors.

21

in the text, structure, or history of section 3742

22

reflects any intent by Congress to deviate from the

23

inveterate and certain cross-appeal rule, nor is there

24

any reason why sentencing appeals should be treated any

25

differently from other appeals.

In 18 U.S.C. section 3742, Congress provided for
Nothing

Instead, section 3742

3
Alderson Reporting Company

reflects traditional principles of appellate

2

jurisdiction.

In --

May I ask you this

4

question?

5

Supposing your client prevailed on appeal and they held

6

a resentencing.

7

the sentence?

8
9

I've been thinking about this case.

Could the district judge have increased

MS. HOWE:

No.

It could not have because

the government -JUSTICE STEVENS:

10

The district judge could

11

not have increased it?

12

sentencing, a fresh hearing on what the sentencing

13

should be, would the district judge have been foreclosed

14

from giving a higher sentence than he gave the first

15

time?

16

MS. HOWE:

If they sent it back for a new

If -- he would have been

17

foreclosed, yes, Your Honor.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

19

that proposition?
MS. HOWE:

20
21
22

What's the authority for

Simply that the -- the district

-JUSTICE STEVENS:

Say, if it was a capital

23

case and he won on appeal, he could get the death

24

sentence the second time around, which is a little more

25

serious sentence.
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

Why couldn't he have gotten a higher
sentence.

3

MS. HOWE:

This is a -- the case actually in

4

United States versus Harvey, which was a case out of the

5

Third Circuit, and, although the district court could

6

order the same sentence, it can't increase the sentence.

7

Yes.

8
9
10
11
12
13
14

It would be circumventing the cross-appeal rule.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is that based on any --

any precedent of this Court's?
MS. HOWE:

No.

It's based on the

cross-appeal rule.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So just on the

cross-appeal rule?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I would have thought

15

it would depend on what the mandate from the court of

16

appeals said.

17

vacated and the case is remanded for resentencing, it

18

seems to me that leaves open the full range of

19

legitimate sentencing.

20

If the mandate said the sentence is

MS. HOWE:

Certainly.

I mean, our argument

21

would be that the -- you know, if the court of appeals

22

can't order the sentence increased, that on remand the

23

district court couldn't circumvent the cross-appeal rule

24

by increasing the sentence as well.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Well, but the court

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of appeals -- if your argument is correct, the court of

2

appeals is limited solely by virtue of the failure to

3

file a notice of cross-appeal.

4

limitation that wouldn't apply in the district court.

5

MS. HOWE:

That -- that's a

No, that's certainly true, that

6

it would be circumventing the cross-appeal rule to allow

7

the district court to do something that --

8
9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And it would also, I take

it, be circumventing what could happen in the district

10

court.

You have to move very -- seven days in the

11

district court for mathematical error, and that's it.

12

MS. HOWE:

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

MS. HOWE:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

This would not be a

mathematical error?

19
20

Yes, the district court has, I

believe, seven days to correct the sentence.

17
18

Other than for assistance

--

15
16

Yes, under this rule.

MS. HOWE:

No.

This would not be a

mathematical error, but --

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I could have sworn that

22

I've seen more than one petition for certiorari in which

23

the claim is that the sentence was increased on remand

24

vindictively.

25

that.

I'm sure I've seen cert petitions like

And you're telling me that the assertion of
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

vindictiveness is unnecessary, and it just can't be

2

increased on remand?

3
4

But all you have is a court of appeals case
for that.

5

MS. HOWE:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

Yes, we -Perhaps that's after a new

trial.

8

MS. HOWE:

Perhaps.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What happens if it's --

10

what happens if the sentence is five years, reversed on

11

appeal, error in evidence, same -- same offense, same

12

indictment?

13

vindictiveness rules before he can give a higher

14

sentence?

Then you have to comply with the

MS. HOWE:

15

I think it might be different if

16

it were -- if there were a new trial on the same

17

indictment.

18

cross-appeal rule, I mean, the court of appeals could --

19

the district court could certainly impose the same

20

sentence.

21

But -- you know, going back to the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What do you think is the

22

rule if there's a new trial and the judge says, you

23

know, what about this, I heard the evidence again; I

24

think I'm going to increase the sentence?

25

MS. HOWE:

Well, our argument would be that
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the government had forfeited the right to make that

2

argument and that the district court would not be -- you

3

know, that would essentially be sua sponte ordering --

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

MS. HOWE:

6

But what's sua sponte --

You know, if the government had

--

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8

There's a new judgment, a new conviction.

9

then?
MS. HOWE:

10

-- the rule may be different.

12

may apply as well.

14

Double jeopardy if it's a

Is that what you said?

15

MS. HOWE:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

Unless double jeopardy

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
new judge?

What happens

New judgment and conviction -- it

11

13

It's a resentence.

I -- I'm not sure.
Who asked this question?

We're going to get a totally different case here.

18

(Laughter.)

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Let's go back to where

20

you started, and that was with the statute, 37 -- what

21

is it?

42?

22

MS. HOWE:

42.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- (f).

And the -- that

24

has two subparts, and the first part just says the court

25

of appeals can decide whether a sentence was imposed in
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

violation of law, period.

2

And (2) has two subparts that refer to the

3

party appealing.

4

both sides when the second one is distinctly divided

5

into (a) and (b) parts?

6

So why doesn't the first one cover

MS. HOWE:

Certainly, Justice Ginsburg.

And

7

that -- this is reprinted on page 5a of the government's

8

brief.

9

Justice Ginsburg, you're drawing and that the amicus

And the inference that I think,

10

would have you draw is that the fact that the subsection

11

(f)(2), which is on page 6a, subsection (f)(2)(A) and

12

(b) refer to whether the appeal has been filed; whereas,

13

subsection (f)(1) says not, which means that, in some

14

circumstances, the cross-appeal rule does not apply in

15

circumstances such as that.

16

But our interpretation, which we think is

17

the correct one, is that the only reason that subsection

18

(f)(1) does not refer to whether an appeal has been

19

filed is that subsection (f)(1)

20

claims that both defendants and the government can

21

bring; whereas, subsection (f)(2) parallels

22

subsections(a)(3) and (b)(3), but (c), only the

23

defendant can appeal an upward departure; only the

24

government can appeal a downward departure.

25

refers to the kind of

And our interpretation, again, which we
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

think is the correct one, is that subsection (f)(1)

2

doesn't need to refer to whether an appeal has been

3

filed, because -- because both the defendant and the

4

government can bring those kinds of appeals.

5

And even if you don't agree with that

6

interpretation, I think it's worth noting that the

7

amicus -- that the amicus's construction is further

8

flawed for three reasons.

9

would cause subsection (f)(2) to operate illogically.

And the first is that that

10

There's no reason why the -- for example, if you had a

11

case in which the defendant had appealed and the

12

government had not appealed, under this interpretation

13

the court of appeals could increase a sentence if it

14

found there had been a misapplication of the Guidelines

15

that would result in an increase in the defendant's

16

sentence; but the court of appeals would not be allowed

17

to increase the defendant's sentence if it found that

18

there was an unwarranted downward departure, because the

19

government had filed a notice of appeal.

20

-- that doesn't make any sense.

21

any reason why Congress would have intended for it to

22

operate this way.

23

We don't think

We don't think there's

The second reason is that this is a very

24

thin reed to rest this construction of the statute on,

25

given that Congress must have been aware of the
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

cross-appeal rule.

2

would have departed from two centuries of appellate

3

practice in this way, based on this -- this very thin

4

reed, and in fact we know from the Organized Crime

5

Control Act of 1970 that Congress was aware of the

6

cross-appeal rule because in that case it expressly

7

carved out that exception --

8
9

There's no reason to think that it

the converse case?

What happens if it's just

The same thing, I take it.

MS. HOWE:

JUSTICE BREYER:

appeal.

13

thinks it should be 20.

I'm sorry?
We have a government

14

The sentence was 10 years.

The government

On appeal, the appellate court thinks the

15

government is wrong, and moreover, the appellate court

16

discovers an error:

17

you're saying, well, according to you, not only is the

18

court of appeals helpless, but the district court is

19

helpless.

20

where he shouldn't have been.

21

here?

It should have been one year.

And

So this person is in jail for nine years

22

MS. HOWE:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's your position

That's correct, Justice Breyer.
Well, that's a pretty tough

24

position.

It -- it seems to me there could be errors --

25

and I guess if he's sentenced to death, it's the same.
11
Alderson Reporting Company

1

I mean, the -- the -- it's a pretty tough position,

2

isn't it?

3

appeals, or in the district court, or anywhere in the

4

system to create -- to correct a serious error where a

5

person could, in fact, be in prison for a long time

6

contrary to the law.

That there is no authority in the courts of

7

MS. HOWE:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9
10
11
12

Well -How is it supposed to work

in your system that we get those errors corrected?
MS. HOWE:

I have three points,

Justice Breyer.
The first is that Congress must have been

13

aware of this scenario in particular because in the

14

Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, when the government

15

appeals, that -- in those provisions, that brought up

16

the defendant's sentence and his conviction for review.

17

And Congress decided, for whatever reason, not to

18

continue that -- that exception to the cross-appeal rule

19

when it enacted the Sentencing Reform Act.

20

The second point, Justice Breyer, is that

21

we're not aware that there's actually any body of case

22

law in which this happened.

23

cases in which this has actually happened.

24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No one has pointed to any
The --

I believe you say it has

decided not to make an exception to the cross-appeal
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

rule.

Of course, the cross-appeal rule itself is not

2

statutory, is it?

3

MS. HOWE:

4

not statutory, but --

5

The cross-appeal rule itself is

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It's an arguable rule

6

among the courts of appeal as to whether there is such a

7

rule.

8
9

MS. HOWE:

It is indeed, Justice Stevens,

but -JUSTICE STEVENS:

10

So it's not surprising

11

that Congress didn't make exception to a rule that isn't

12

that firmly established.

13

MS. HOWE:

It is not surprising, but we know

14

from the Organized Crime Control Act that Congress

15

certainly was aware of the cross-appeal rule, because in

16

that case it did carve out a limited exception.

17

And my third point, Justice Breyer,

18

returning to your question, is that the defendant in

19

that case may well have an argument, may be able to seek

20

post-conviction relief under section 2255, as the

21

Government acknowledges in its brief.

22

So he may be able to go back to the district

23

court under section 2255 and obtain relief in that

24

manner.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought it was sort of an

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

important part of your case that the cross-appeal rule

2

was an established rule.

3

not an established rule?

4

MS. HOWE:

You now knowledge that it's

Well, we do believe it is

5

jurisdictional, Justice Scalia.

6

which we think --

7
8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In the Morley case,

Not just jurisdictional but

well-established.
MS. HOWE:

We believe it is both

10

well-established and jurisdictional.

11

particular, when you're talking about sentencing, even

12

if you don't agree with us that the cross-appeal rule

13

generally is jurisdiction, we believe that section 3742

14

is jurisdictional.

15

and B, the kinds of errors that defendants and the

16

government can bring.

17

And we believe, in

Because it sets out in subsections A

But we also believe that it ultimately

18

doesn't matter in this case, Justice Scalia, because

19

even if, as amicus concedes, it is merely a rule of

20

practice, it is a rule of practice that is not subject

21

to exception, and Mr. Greenlaw timely invoked it at his

22

earliest opportunity.

23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you say it is a

well-established at least rule of practice.
MS. HOWE:

Absolutely.

certainly does not apply it.

The Tenth Circuit -Well, they --

They didn't apply it under

I am saying, apart from this statute,

10

what courts of appeals in other cases deny the existence

11

of a cross-appeal rule?

12

MS. HOWE:

The District of Columbia Circuit

13

and the Ninth Circuit both regard it is a rule of

14

practice that may be subject to exceptions and

15

exceptional circumstances.

16

practice, Justice Scalia, we still prevail because

If this

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. MAYNARD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Court of Appeals erred in increasing
Petitioner's sentence for two reasons:
First, it lacked jurisdiction to do so in

20

the absence of a notice of appeal by the Government

21

under 18 USC 3742(b).

22

Second, even assuming it did not strictly

23

lack jurisdiction, it nevertheless violated the

24

mandatory claim- processing rule that a judgment may not

25

be increased in favor of an appellee in the absence of a

2

timely -JUSTICE ALITO:

Now, if the cross-appeal

3

rule is jurisdictional, how do you account for the

4

sentencing-package cases?

5

count 1, and the district court makes a mistake on count

6

1, the court of appeals vacates the entire sentence for

7

the development of a new sentencing package.

8
9

MS. MAYNARD:

The court makes a mistake on

Those cases are not

inconsistent with the finding of jurisdictional, Justice

10

Alito, because in those cases the court of appeals has

11

granted the defendant's requested relief, and it has

12

vacated the judgment at the request of the defendant.

13

And then, once it goes back to the district

14

court, what the district court may lawfully do would

15

turn on the scope of the mandate, not on principles of

16

the cross-appeal rule.

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But in this very case

18

could the court of appeals said:

19

appellant a new sentencing hearing and send the case

20

back to the district for resentencing; and, by the way,

21

district judge, when you do the resentencing, take a

22

look at the section that imposes a mandatory minimum?

23

Could they have done that?

24
25

MS. MAYNARD:

We will grant the

If the court of appeals had

found an error at the defendant's request, yes,
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Justice Stevens, and remanded it, depending on the scope

2

of the mandate and under the scope of the mandate --

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And you could have ended

4

up with precisely the same result that they ended up

5

with in this case.

6

MS. MAYNARD:

But it would have been a key

7

difference in the sense that they would have found some

8

of the defendant's claims on appeal correct.

9

court of appeals rejected all of the defendant's claims;

Here the

10

and, nevertheless, in the absence of a government

11

appeal, increased the Petitioner's sentence.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

So if the Court of Appeals

13

had said that the sentence that was imposed by the

14

district court was unreasonable by two months and

15

accepted the defendant's argument to that extent and

16

then remanded, on remand the district court could have

17

corrected the sentence on the gun counts.

18

MS. MAYNARD:

It would have depended on how

19

the mandate was worded.

20

sentence in its entirety and remanded it, the district

21

court could have imposed a lawful sentence at that time.

22

Yes.

23

But if they vacated the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Even though the

24

prosecution didn't ask for it?

I thought that you were

25

relying on the division of authority between the
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

executive, the prosecutor, and the court.

And that is

2

that a court reacts to the charges that the prosecutor

3

brings, and if the prosecutor isn't asking for a higher

4

sentence, the court has no authority to grant it.

5

MS. MAYNARD:

Yes, Your Honor.

6

of appeals that is true.

But I understood

7

Justice Alito's hypothetical to posit a situation where

8

at the defendant's request his sentence was vacated.

9

And then what the district court could do on remand

10

would depend on the scope of the mandate .

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, usually the

2

mandate in these cases simply says, you know, the case

3

is remanded to the district court.

4

If that's all the mandate says, does that

5

authorize the district court to do the right thing under

6

the law?

7

MS. MAYNARD:

The courts of appeals have

8

different rules, Your Honor, about whether or not a

9

general mandate of the type that you posit should be

10

assumed to open up all issues for sentencing or not.

11
12
13

And there's actually some disagreement in
the circuit on what one assumes from a general mandate.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, actually rule 35 was

14

changed because it used to be based on the mandate.

15

now rule 35 says you can reopen within seven days after

16

the verdict or finding of guilty.

17

indicate under the rules that the mandate is irrelevant.

18

MS. MAYNARD:

But

So that would

Well, no, Your Honor.

I think

19

rule 35 speaks to what the district can do within seven

20

days of renouncing the sentence.

21

timely appealed, if the defendant were to prevail or if

22

the government were to prevail in a case in which the

23

government had actually appealed and it were to be

24

remanded, then the defendant --

Once the sentence is

I don't understand your

mandate rule as being consistent with your general

6

theory of the case.

7

cannot order this kind of relief, how could it be that

8

the court of appeals' mandate would authorize the

9

relief?

Because if the court of appeals

10

It would seem to me that you've either got

11

to take the position that the mandate is, in effect, a

12

kind of neutral order.

13

not have authority to do something after the mandate

14

comes down.

15

position that the mandate, itself, by the court of

16

appeals will, itself, determine what the district court

17

can do.

The district courts may or may

But I don't see how you can take the

18

MS. MAYNARD:

Well --

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Because, in effect, I think

20

you are saying, by structuring the mandate in a certain

21

way, the court of appeals can open the door to something

22

that the court of appeals, itself, could not do.

23

structuring the mandate in a different way, the court of

24

appeals can cut off the possibility of district court

25

orders of a sort that the court of appeals couldn't do.

MS. MAYNARD:

I don't think it is anomalous,

Your Honor, in a case in which the court of appeals has

jurisdiction over a claim, grants the requested relief,

and vacates the sentence.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All right.

Now, let's

11

consider -- assuming that the mandate leaves open -- the

12

question open entirely for the district court.

You said ultimately what the district court

can do depends on the mandate.

because we couldn't increase the sentence here, you

the mandate that you are assuming when you say it

depends on the mandate?

24

would depend on the mandate.

25

MS. MAYNARD:

What the district court can do

Well, I'm not sure I

1

understand the --

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Where is the -- what option

3

does the court of appeals -- given the limits on what

4

the court of appeals itself can order, what are the

5

options that the court of appeals has in writing the

6

mandate that will determine what the district court can

7

do?

8

What are you getting at.

9

MS. MAYNARD:

I'm not sure that that's -- I

don't know the precise contours of that, Justice Souter,

10

but if the court of appeals grants the Petitioner's

11

request to vacate the sentence --

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

13

MS. MAYNARD:

Yeah.

-- and then remands for

14

resentencing, in a general way, that could leave open to

the district court the ability to resentence.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I don't know about your

initial premise.

I -- I take it the policy here is that

6

the defendant who appeals ought to know what's at stake

7

in the appeal.

He shouldn't be surprised.

8

MS. MAYNARD:

That's right.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If he cross-appeals, fine;

10

if he doesn't cross-appeal, he knows what the stakes

are.

That's right.

Why should the court

Well, because it -- once

the court -- if the Petitioner -- I mean -- at any risk

21

in any appeal, and this is true in civil cases, too, you

22

know, if you seek a new trial on damages, for example,

23

in a civil case, because of instructional error, and you

6

years instead of 10.

7
8

He says I don't want the

And nothing else?

That's the only relief I

seek?

9

MS. MAYNARD:

I think if the court of

10

appeals finds error in the sentence it vacates under the

11

-- the remedial provisions in 3742 for the -- for the

12

court -- for the district court to resentence the

13

Petitioner.

14

For example --

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well -- if that's the case,

16

if the -- if the -- if it cannot be structured by the

17

request for relief as the Chief Justice is suggesting,

18

then on the Government's theory, in a case like this, if

19

the defendant wins on appeal, he is in serious trouble

20

when that case goes back to the district court; whereas

21

if he loses, he can't be any worse off than he is now.

22

That's a strange -- that's a strange rule.

23

MS. MAYNARD:

Well, if the defendant wins in

24

the sentencing appeal, there -- there's always a chance

25

that on -- on remand, the -- the district court will
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reconfigure the sentence.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But in effect that means

3

then -- and this -- I didn't understand this to be your

4

position -- but that means, in effect, that the

5

cross-appeal rule is essentially, as you're arguing for

6

it, a formality.

7

do, but it is not a rule that embodies the notion that

8

when a defendant appeals the defendant ought to know, in

9

effect, what he can gain and what he can lose; because

It limits what the district court can

10

if, on your theory, if the defendant wins and there's a

11

mandate back to the district court, it is wide open.

12

MS. MAYNARD:

Well, I think, you know, if

13

you look at cases -- recent -- I think post-Booker for

14

example --

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, I want to look at

16

them but I want to know what your position is first.

17

And I take it your position is that if the defendant

18

wins, and he cannot by his request for leave limit the

19

relief, as the Chief Justice suggested, then when the

20

case goes back to the district court, in effect, the

21

slate is totally blank and he's starting all over again

22

and he is subject to -- to whatever outer limits he

23

would have been subject to in the first instance.

not free from the mandatory Guidelines.

And when those is

is essentially a rule of appellate court procedure and

nothing more.

There are 8,000 plus adverse decisions against the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY T. JORGENSEN,

2

AS AMICUS CURIAE,

3

IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW

4

MR. JORGENSEN:

5
6

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
There are three questions really in this

7

case, and the Court need not resolve all of them

8

depending upon how it resolves the others, but some of

9

them get lost sometimes, so I would like to state what

10
11

the three are.
The three are first, does section 3742

12

provide an answer?

13

to the court of appeals to the Eighth Circuit to give

14

the right answer when the Petitioner asked them is my

15

sentence imposed in violation of law?

16

on the court's power telling them they cannot provide

17

him with relief?

18

Is it an affirmative grant of power

Or is it a limit

That's the first question.

If the Court concludes that it's neither --

19

if a Court a court concludes either that it is a grant

20

of jurisdiction, or rather a power -- or that it's not,

21

that it's an affirmative limit, then the -- if the Court

22

concludes that 3742 is more like 1291, just a general

23

appellate statute that does not give the answer here,

24

then the Court has to go on to decide is this case -- is

25

this rule, this cross-appeal rule, in the criminal
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

context not the civil context that is -- that is subject

2

of this 200 years of discussion, but in the criminal

3

context is it a jurisdictional limit on what the courts

4

can do or is it a rule of practice.

5

And then finally, if the Court concludes --

6

if the Court concludes it is a jurisdictional limit,

7

then that's the end.

8

a rule of practice, the final third question is:

9

a waivable rule of practice or is it a firm and

If the Court concludes that it is
Is it

10

inflexible rule of practice?

I think what often gets

11

assumed.

12

Court addresses the issue in that case -- in those cases

13

and decides whether the rule of practice at issue in

14

that case --

But, of course, in Kontrick, in Bowles, the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

Mr. Jorgensen, suppose I

16

think there's a larger anterior question to all of this?

17

And that is what I suggested in the colloquy with

18

Ms. Howe, we have a system in which the prosecutor can

19

bring charges.

20

looking at this set of facts, you could have charged

21

much more.

22

The judge may think, my goodness,

The judge can't do that, he can't tell the

23

prosecutor you have to charge "Y" in addition to "X".

24

The government chooses not to appeal.

25

does the court say, I know you didn't appeal,
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Now, what right

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Government, but should have so we're going to take care

2

of it for you?

3

It seems to me that our system rests on a

4

principle of party presentation as many systems do not.

5

In many systems, the court does shape the controversy

6

and can intrude issues on its own.

7

adversarial system, we rely on counsel to do that kind

8

of thing.

9

without getting down to particular statutory provisions,

But in our

So, my problem with your whole position,

10

is what business does the court have to put an issue in

11

the case that counsel chose not to raise?

12

MR. JORGENSEN:

The answer to that question,

13

Justice Ginsburg, is multi-part, and I'll try to move

14

through it quickly.

15

very point that you made at the charging stage.

16

the charging stage the court -- the district court

17

cannot decide what a criminal will be charged with; but

18

that once the trial has proceeded to judgment, that

19

prosecutorial discretion is at an end.

20

remember the name of the case, but Justice Scalia was

21

the author.

This Court had said -- made the

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

(Laughter.)

24

MR. JORGENSEN:

25

That at

I wish I could

Me, too.

The point being that once a

crime has been proven, the law kicks in, and the
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

defendant must be sentenced in accordance with lawful.

2

The same is true on appeal.

3

for, I think, what your question would assume, which

4

would be a roving court of jurisdiction -- a roving

5

court of appeals that could reach out and take

6

jurisdiction over a case that has not been brought to

7

it.

8

I'm not advocating here

Under 3742 no one questions that the court

9

has jurisdiction over the case, over the very sentencing

10

issues because somebody has filed a notice of appeal and

11

brought it to the court.

12

defendant says to the court under 3742(a)(1) was my

13

sentence imposed and the statutory languages in

14

violation of law, can the Eighth Circuit provide the

15

right answer or is it powerless to provide the right

16

answer to only provide an answer that benefits him?

17

The only question is when the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Could we discuss -- let's

18

leave aside for the moment what the background rule of

19

law is and discuss whether -- I guess it was your first

20

point -- whether this particular statute proscribes the

21

answer, and therefore, we don't have to go any further.

22

Why do you say it proscribes the answer?

23

MR. JORGENSEN:

I believe that it does,

24

Justice, because everybody agrees that the Sentencing

25

Reform Act was a clean break with the past and imposed
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

an entirely new regime.

2

of the past is somewhat beside the point.

3

So, the talk about the regime

So then you get down to the language itself

4

of section 3742.

Under (a), it provides that a

5

defendant may ask the court of appeals was my sentence

6

imposed in violation of law; and under (b)(1), the

7

government can raised same appeal.

8

parties certify to the court or bring to the court the

9

record that they think addresses the issue that either

Then under (d), the

10

side raised; and then in (e), the court -- (e) says the

11

court shall decide whether it was imposed in violation

12

of law; and then (f) (1) says if the court determines

13

that it was imposed in violation of law, it shall send

14

it back with instructions.
Now, the main answer to that is well,

15
16

(f)(1) -- you have to get all the way to (f)(1) before

17

you have got the answer.

18

don't think any member of the court would say that the

19

Eighth Circuit lacks the power, is barred from noticing

20

the 924(c) error here.

21

And that's unsurprising.

Certainly the Eighth Circuit could see it;

8

clear that if it hasn't been raised by one or the other

party, the court doesn't get into it.

It's clear under (f)(2) if the

two?

In other words, I'm saying that far from

12

supporting your case, as your brief suggests, (f)(2) (a)

13

and (a) seems to me harms your case.

14

MR. JORGENSEN:

If I can give a two-part

15

answer, Justice.

First, the court is not in the

16

practice of overturning what the plain language says on

17

a sort of legislative history or surmising what Congress

18

may have been motivated by.

19

is a clear answer.

But even if it were, there

(F)(1) subsumes (a)(1) and (a)(2) and (b)(1)

20
21

and (b)(2).

And the questions under those statutes or

22

rather those provisions are legal questions.

23

of questions was this sentence imposed under (a)(1),

24

(b)(1) in violation of law or (a)(2), (b)(2), was it an

25

incorrect application of Sentencing Guidelines?
37
Alderson Reporting Company

The kind

1

If the court of appeals gets that wrong,

2

that's the kind of thing that's going to be imposed in

3

everybody else's case.

4

defendant's case.

5

Under (3) and (4) it's this

JUSTICE BREYER:

Wait, (2)(a) and (b) I

6

thought -- do I not have this right, (2)(a) and (b) say

7

the same thing as (1)?

8

high says the defendant's appeal, then what you do is

9

you vacate it and send it back with such instructions as

10

It says if the sentence is too

the court considers appropriate.

11

MR. JORGENSEN:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13
14

Indeed.
Subject to (g), which has

to do with the district court.
Then the other part says if it is too low

15

and it was the government that appealed, the court shall

16

set it aside and send it back with such instructions as

17

it considers appropriate, again subject to (g).

18

So all three say the same thing.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

the defendant has appealed.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's what --

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Not if it's too high and

23

Not if it's too high and

the government has appealed.

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's right.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If it's too high and the

government has appealed, you don't get any relief

2

under -- under --

4

JUSTICE BREYER:
high -- wait.

Wait.

Yes, do you.

If it's too

If it is too -- ah.

5

(Laughter.)

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

MR. JORGENSEN:

I see.
You're exactly right,

8

Justice Scalia.

So the question is, why would Congress

9

say what is plainly said, which is under (f)(1)

10

violations of law and incorrect applications of the

11

Sentencing Guidelines, the court gives the right answer

12

no matter who appeals.

13

specifies it matters under this who appeals.

14

reason is, in those instances, it is too high in this

15

defendant's case, and this defendant can be entrusted to

16

forward his own cause; but under (a)(1) and (a)(2), then

17

you get a court of appeals precedent that gives the

18

wrong answer, if a question of law or the application of

19

the Sentencing Guidelines.

20
21
22

But under (f)(2) Congress
And the

So there is a difference between (a)(1),
(a)(2), (b)(1), (b)(2) as -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, that difference

23

disappears if you say that, in fact, the whole thing

24

assumes that the factor complained of has been brought

25

to the court's attention by the proper person.
39
Alderson Reporting Company

So that

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

(f)(1) assumes that if it's the government appealing in

2

violation of law because the defendant was given too

3

little, or if it's the defendant appealing because in

4

violation of law that he was given too much, it makes

5

much more sense that way, it seems to me.

6

MR. JORGENSEN:

That -- that -- if the Court

7

were to go there, Justice, I believe that goes back to

you previous question of:

the Court believe that Congress was aware of its

The way to do this then is

Well, importantly, Justice,

of Sentencing Guideline (c)(3)?

6

There's a body of case law as to what kind of a field --

7

fields fit within what category.

8

the courts of appeals are united in believing that the

But, as you know, the Court created the

12

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

But you don't have --

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But it's not enough to say,

16

well, we've noticed by the way we're -- you know, in

looking at the proper appeal by the proper -- my

19

It's not that.

You're saying the court of

that there were no errors in favor -- or harming the

And that's a considerable burden, as Judge

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. JORGENSEN:

Indeed, although it is what

3742 says, and I believe it's actually not that

4

different than what happens with jurisdictional issues.

5

The court must resolve those that are brought to it.

to pare down what is jurisdictional.

MR. JORGENSEN:

And on that question, I --

13

before the time runs out, I want to, Justice Scalia,

24

under those cases, there is no good argument that it's

25

jurisdictional.

Now, the Court has provided the answer to

And then the Court has
And

The teachings of those cases is that
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the Court has used the phrases "power" and

2

"jurisdiction" too broadly, too loosely, and is now, as

3

you say, trying to cut back on those jurisdictional

4

limits.

5

if it's based on a statute, and I believe all the

6

parties agree this rule is not based on a statute.

And a rule like this can only be jurisdictional

7

So then that gets us finally to the question

8

of, if 3742 does not provide the answer and it is a rule

9

of practice, is it a mandatory rule of practice, an

10

inflexible rule of practice?

11

use discretion as to whether or not to apply it when

it's invoked?

Or one where the Court can

discretionary.

I thought the district court normally has it

You can't be vindictive, but that's the

3

That's how it works normally, I thought.
And given -- if that's so, then you look at

4

the three sections we just saw, try to read them

5

together, and say they certainly are written with the

6

notion that the noticing of a plain error on the other

7

side is going to be few and far between if ever.

So the normal way to handle it is just what
we said:

-- I decide this for the defendant here.

course it's open on resentencing to go into that.

Now does that work?

JUSTICE BREYER:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, if this were to be a

8

more frequent occurrence, i.e., plain errors, then we

9

were to rule for you and court of appeals generally

10

would do this, then a defendant might think twice

11

about appealing in a complex case.

12

MR. JORGENSEN:

That's true, Justice.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Because there's nothing

14

that could happen -- once the district court rules and

the seven days for error goes by, there's nothing that

16

anybody can do to raise it.

question was true, Justice Kennedy, but respectfully the

the rules, a defendant must file his notice of appeal

with them.

infect all cases.

MR. JORGENSEN:

number of competeding factors such that you might, if

you were a judge, a district judge, reduce a sentence

MR. JORGENSEN:

Exactly.

And that can't be

8

done.

sentence can be exactly the same, even though the

10

But, otherwise, with that narrow exception, the

defendant prevailed on appeal.

11

Now, that played out exactly in this case.

12

In this case, when it went back to the district court,

13

the defendant said to the district court:

14

more.

16
17
18

Don't give me

You can fit the new fifteen years within what I
Give me what I already have.

And the District Judge said:

No.

I'm going

to give you more.
Now, the answer clearly, I think, cannot

19

turn on the fact that the Seventh -- excuse me -- the

20

Eighth Circuit knew the answer.

21

about what if the Eighth Circuit said:

22

error here, but I don't know how it affects your

23

sentence, so I am sending you back.

24
25

We had some questions
Well, I see an

Would that be okay?

But it can't turn on the -- that the Seventh
Circuit knew in this instance that he would get an

increased sentence as versus it would be okay to send it

2

back without saying what the effect would be for the

3

district judge to impose.

4

And, Justice Kennedy, your question was:

5

What happens if there's a new trial?

As my children

6

would say, it is a complete do-over.

When the trial

7

starts all over again, new facts are found or not found,

8

and the sentence is completely constructed all over

9

again based on the facts as found by the jury in the

10

second trial.

11

If I can end, Justices, I would end by

12

saying that I believe section 3742 does provide the

13

answer here.

14

past.

15

that they would have followed, I think, is contradicted

16

by Reynolds, where this Court did the opposite; Langnes,

17

where this Court said that the cross-appeal rule was a

18

rule of practice, not a jurisdictional limit; and the

19

confusion in the courts of appeals.

Congress provided a clean break with the

The idea that Congress was aware of a clear rule

I believe the answer to your question,

20
21

justice Scalia, on whether it is well-established is

22

that in the civil context I believe the D.C. Third,

23

Fourth, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits say that this is a

24

rule of practice while the Senate has debated it back

25

and forth.
55
Alderson Reporting Company

1

And in Neztsosie the Court noted this

2

confusion and noted, indeed, that some of the circuits

3

are internally inconsistent as to what the rule is.

4

It is slightly different in the criminal

5

context.

6

have not followed -- have not followed the rule, while

7

the Second, Third, Fourth and Seventh have; and the

8

Fifth is internally inconsistent.

9

some error, honestly, in that recitation.

10

I believe the Eighth and the Tenth Circuits

I may -- I may have
I did it from

memory when you asked.

11

But my point, I think, comes through no

12

matter what, which is:

How could Congress have assumed

13

this is a clear rule and, when we write these words, the

14

courts will know that's what we mean, when there's all

15

this confusion amongst the courts?

16

Thank you, Your Honors.

Ms. Howe, you have two minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF AMY HOWE

20

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

21

MS. HOWE:

Mr. Chief Justice, I have two

22

points.

The first is that the amicus argues that

23

subsection (e) of section 3742 provides the answer in

24

this case:

25

of Appeals shall determine.

That upon a review of the record the Court
And so his argument is that

56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this authorizes and, in fact, requires the court of

2

appeals to determine whether any of the errors that are

3

outlined in subsection (e) have occurred.

4

possibly be this sort empowering, roving, free-standing

5

authority that the amicus believes it is.

6

But (e) can't

Because if you look at the language of

7

subsection (e), all it provides -- and this Court has

8

recognized that it merely provides the scope of review

9

-- that, upon review of the record, the court of appeals

10

shall determine.

It doesn't say anything about whether

11

a notice of appeal has been filed, how the record got

12

there.

13

at the structure of the statute.

And to figure out those things you have to look

14

And when you look at the structure of the

15

statute, it is clear that subsections (a) and (b) are

16

the provisions that provide for appellate jurisdiction

17

in sentencing cases.

18

Amicus also tries to argue that, you know --

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

MR. HOWE:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

(E) also contradicts (f) --

(F)(2)and then --- (2)(A) and (B) because

22

in some of those cases it doesn't determine that if the

23

appeal has been brought by the wrong party.

24
25

MS. HOWE:

That's absolutely right.

merely provides the remedy, Justice Scalia.
57
Alderson Reporting Company

That

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And the amicus tries also to argue that this

2

is not some sort of free-standing, roving appellate

3

authority.

4

brought under (A)(1), a violation of law, the court of

5

appeals only needs to determine whether it is a

6

violation of law.

7

appeals is not obligated to scour the record for errors.

8

It is only to notice plain error.

9

That, you know, for example, if the case is

But he also argued that the court of

But if one should start placing these

10

limits, these limits come from subsections (a) and (b)

11

and the background of traditional appellate practice.

12

And once you start placing these limits which do not

13

appear in the text on subsection (e), the entire

14

construction falls apart.
The second point I would make is that the

15
16

amicus argues that, somehow, section 3742 represents as

17

a break from the past; that Congress did not have in

18

mind the background of this well- established appellate

19

procedure.

20

may I finish -- it was only providing for limited

21

appellate review.

22

But in section 3742 Congress made clear --

And if you are going to treat sentencing

23

cases differently in light of this court's historic

24

practice of construing the availability of government

25

appeals narrow rate, you need to treat -- you need to be
