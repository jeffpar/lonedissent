versus Heller.

Mr. Dellinger.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. DELLINGER:

Good morning, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
The Second Amendment was a direct response

12

to concern over Article I, Section 8 of the

13

Constitution, which gave the new national Congress the

14

surprising, perhaps even the shocking, power to

15

organize, arm, and presumably disarm the State militias.

16

What is at issue this morning is the scope and nature of

17

the individual right protected by the resulting

18

amendment and the first text to consider is the phrase

19

protecting a right to keep and bear arms.

20

debates over the Second Amendment, every person who used

21

the phrase "bear arms" used it to refer to the use of

22

arms in connection with militia service and when Madison

23

introduced the amendment in the first Congress, he

24

exactly equated the phrase "bearing arms" with, quote,

25

"rendering military service."

In the

We know this from the

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

inclusion in his draft of a clause exempting those with

2

religious scruples.

3

people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, a

4

well armed and well regulated militia being the best

5

security of a free country, but no person religiously

6

scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render

7

military service in person."

8

His clause says "The right of the

And even if the language of keeping and

9

bearing arms were ambiguous, the amendment's first

10

clause confirms that the right is militia-related.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If you're right,

12

Mr. Dellinger, it's certainly an odd way in the Second

13

Amendment to phrase the operative provision.

14

limited to State militias, why would they say "the right

15

of the people"?

16

"state militias have the right to keep arms"?

17

If it is

In other words, why wouldn't they say

MR. DELLINGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, I believe

18

that the phrase "the people" and the phrase "the

19

militia" were really in -- in sync with each other.

20

will see references in the debates of, the Federalist

21

Farmer uses the phrase "the people are the militia, the

22

militia are the people."

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You

But if that's right,

24

doesn't that cut against you?

If the militia included

25

all the people, doesn't the preamble that you rely on
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

not really restrict the right much at all?

2

all the people.

It includes

3

MR. DELLINGER:

Yes, I do believe it

4

includes all the people in the sense of

5

Verdugo-Urquidez, all those who are part of the polity.

6

What -- what defines the amendment is the scope and

7

nature of the right that the people have.

8

right to participate in the common defense and you have

9

a right invocable in court if a Federal regulation

It's, it is a

10

interferes with your right to train for or whatever the

11

militia has established.

12

So that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

One of the concerns,

13

Mr. Dellinger, of the framers, was not to establish a

14

practice of amending the Constitution and its important

15

provisions, and it seems to me that there is an

16

interpretation of the Second Amendment differing from

17

that of the district court and in Miller and not

18

advanced particularly in the red brief, but that

19

conforms the two clauses and in effect delinks them.

20

The first clause I submit can be read consistently with

21

the purpose I've indicated of simply reaffirming the

22

existence and the importance of the militia clause.

23

Those were very important clauses.

24

they're in Article I and Article II.

25

the amendment says we reaffirm the right to have a
5
Alderson Reporting Company

As you've indicated,
And so in effect

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

militia, we've established it, but in addition, there is

2

a right to bear arms.

Can you comment on that?

3

MR. DELLINGER:

Yes.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And this makes, it does --

5

I think you're write right in the brief to say that the

6

preface shouldn't be extraneous.

7

extraneous.

8

reaffirm several principles:

9

peaceably assemble, the right to be secure in their

This means it's not

The Constitution reaffirms the rights,
The right of the people to

10

homes, the Tenth Amendment reaffirms the rights, and

11

this is simply a reaffirmation of the militia clause.

12

MR. DELLINGER:

Justice Kennedy, I think any

13

interpretation that delinks the two clauses as if they

14

were dealing with related but nonetheless different

15

subject matters has that to count against it, and what

16

you don't see in the debates over the Second Amendment

17

are references to, in those debates, the use of weapons

18

for personal purposes.

19

that literally transposes to this:

20

regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free

21

State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms

22

shall not be" --

23

What you see is the clause that,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

"Because a well

Well the subject is "arms"

24

in both clauses, as I've suggested is the common

25

subject, and they're closely related.

1

MR. DELLINGER:

I think, as this Court

2

unanimously held in Miller, or at least noted in

3

Miller -- I'll leave aside the debate.

4

unanimously said in Miller that the Second Amendment

5

must be interpreted in light of its obvious purpose to

6

ensure the continuation and render possible the

7

effectiveness of the military forces.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The court

I don't see how there's

9

any, any, any contradiction between reading the second

10

clause as a -- as a personal guarantee and reading the

11

first one as assuring the existence of a militia, not

12

necessarily a State-managed militia because the militia

13

that resisted the British was not State- managed.

14

why isn't it perfectly plausible, indeed reasonable, to

15

assume that since the framers knew that the way militias

16

were destroyed by tyrants in the past was not by passing

17

a law against militias, but by taking away the people's

18

weapons -- that was the way militias were destroyed.

19

The two clauses go together beautifully:

20

a militia, the right of the people to keep and bear arms

21

shall not be infringed.

22

MR. DELLINGER:

But

Since we need

Yes, but once you assume

23

that the clause is designed to protect the militia, it

24

-- surely it's the militia that decides whether personal

25

possession is necessary.

I mean, Miller -- what makes
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

no sense is for Miller to require the arm to be

2

militia-related if the right is not, and the key phrase

3

is "bear arms."

4

If people --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, do you think the

5

clause, the second clause, the operative clause, is

6

related to something other than the militia?

7

MR. DELLINGER:

No.

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

MR. DELLINGER:

I think --

All right.

Well, then --

-- the second clause, the

10

phrase "keep and bear arms," when "bear arms" is

11

referred to -- is referred to in a military context,

12

that is so that even if you left aside --

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It had nothing to do with

14

the concern of the remote settler to defend himself and

15

his family against hostile Indian tribes and outlaws,

16

wolves and bears and grizzlies and things like that?

17

MR. DELLINGER:

That is not the discourse

18

that is part of the Second Amendment.

19

the debates, the congressional debates, the only use of

20

the phrase "keep and bear arms" is a military phrase,

21

and --

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And when you read

Blackstone thought it was

23

important.

Blackstone thought it was important.

24

thought the right of self-defense was inherent, and the

25

framers were devoted to Blackstone.
8
Alderson Reporting Company

He

Joseph Story, the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

first commentator on the Constitution and a member of

2

this Court, thought it was a personal guarantee.

3

MR. DELLINGER:

When Blackstone speaks of

4

the personal guarantee, he describes it as one of the

5

use of weapons, a common law right.

6

constitutionalizing the Blackstonian common law right,

7

he speaks of a right that is subject to due restrictions

8

and applies to, quote "such weapons, such as are allowed

9

by law."

And if we're

So Blackstone builds in the kind of

10

reasonableness of the regulation that the District of

11

Columbia has.

12

Now, the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that may be

13

true, but that concedes your main point that there is an

14

individual right and gets to the separate question of

15

whether the regulations at issue here are reasonable.

16

MR. DELLINGER:

I don't dispute, Mr. Chief

17

Justice, that the Second Amendment is positive law that

18

a litigant can invoke in court if a State were to decide

19

after recent events that it couldn't rely upon the

20

Federal Government in natural disasters and wanted to

21

have a State-only militia and wanted to have everybody

22

trained in the use of a weapon, a Federal law that

23

interfered with that would be a law that could be

24

challenged in court by, by an individual.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. DELLINGER:

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Dellinger --

Yes.
-- short of that, just to

4

get your position clear, short of reactivating State

5

militias, on your reading does the Second Amendment have

6

any effect today as a restraint on legislation?

7

MR. DELLINGER:

It would, Justice Ginsburg,

8

if the State had a militia and had attributes of the

9

militia contrary to a Federal law.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10
11

And if it didn't --

But it doesn't, as far as

I know.

12

MR. DELLINGER:

As far as I know, today it

13

doesn't.

14

that argument that the amendment is without a use.

15

you don't make up a new use for an amendment whose

16

prohibitions aren't being violated.

17

And I'm not -- and the Respondents make that,

JUSTICE ALITO:

But

I mean --

Your argument is that its

18

purpose was to prevent the disarming of the organized

19

militia, isn't that correct?

20

MR. DELLINGER:

That is correct.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

And if that was the purpose,

22

then how could they -- how could the Framers of the

23

Second Amendment have thought that it would achieve that

24

person, because Congress has virtually plenary power

25

over the militia under the militia clauses?
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. DELLINGER:

That is because, I think,

2

Justice Alito, that those who wanted to retake State

3

authority over the militia didn't get everything they

4

wanted.

5

and wanted to maintain national control.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They got nothing at all,

7

not everything they wanted.

They got nothing at all.

8

So long as it was up to the Federal Government to

9

regulate the militia and to assure that they were armed,

Madison actually did this somewhat reluctantly

10

the Federal Government could, could disband the State

11

militias.

12

MR. DELLINGER:

Yes, but if -- well --

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So what, what was the

14

function served by the Second Amendment as far as the

15

militia is concerned?

16

MR. DELLINGER:

It is by no means clear that

17

the Federal Government could abolish the State militia.

18

It may be presupposed by the Article I, Section 8,

19

clauses 15 and 16, and by the Second Amendment that the

20

States may have a militia.

21

open as to whether you could do that, and it can be

22

called into Federal service but only in particular

23

circumstances.

24
25

That issue has been left

Now I think the better argument for the
other side, if, if there is to be a militia relatedness
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

aspect of the Second Amendment, as we think clear from

2

all of its terms, then Heller's proposed use of a

3

handgun has no connection of any kind to the

4

preservation or efficiency of a militia and therefore

5

the case is over.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but your

7

reading of the militia clause, the militia clause

8

specifically reserves concern rights to the States by

9

its terms.

And as I understand your reading, you would

10

be saying the Second Amendment was designed to take away

11

or expand upon the rights that are reserved, rather than

12

simply guaranteeing what rights were understood to be

13

implicit in the Constitution itself.

14
15

MR. DELLINGER:

I'm not sure I followed the,

the question exactly, but --

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the militia

17

clause, Article I, Section 8, says certain rights are

18

reserved to the States with respect to the militia.

19

yet you're telling us now that this was a very important

20

right that ensured that they kept arms, but it wasn't

21

listed in the rights that were reserved in the militia

22

clause.

23

MR. DELLINGER:

And

The debate over the militia

24

clause -- what is shocking about the militia clauses is

25

that this is a, a new national government that for the
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

first time has the power to create a standing army of

2

professionals.

3

the people themselves, put down their weapons of trade.

4

The States were devoted to the ides of their militia of

5

volunteers, and of all the powers granted to the Federal

6

Government one of the most surprising was to say that

7

Congress shall have the power to organize, arm, and

8

discipline the militia and to -- even though the

9

officers could be appointed by the State, the discipline

The militia were people who came from

10

had to be according to Congress.

11

caused a tremendous negative reaction to the proposed

12

Constitution.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And this was -- this

But the Second -- the

14

Second Amendment doesn't repeal that.

15

the position that Congress no longer has the power to

16

organize, arm, and discipline the militia, do you?

17

MR. DELLINGER:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You don't take

No.
So it was supplementing

19

it.

20

and to what extent did it supplement it.

21

it supplemented it by saying there's a general right to

22

bear arms quite without reference to the militia either

23

way.

24
25

And my question is, the question before us, is how

MR. DELLINGER:

And in my view

It restricted in our view

the authority of the Federal Government to interfere
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

with the arming of the militia by the States.

2

word that caused the most focus was to "arm" and that is

3

to disarm.

4

And the

Now, what I think is happening is that two

5

different rights are being put together.

One was a

6

textual right to protect the militia.

7

better argument for the -- for the other side, for

8

Mr. Heller, is that the amendment's purpose is militia

9

protective, but it was overinclusive in the way that

I think the

10

several of you have suggested, and that is that, as the

11

court below said, preserving the individual right,

12

presumably to have guns for personal use, was the best

13

way to ensure that the militia could serve when called.

14

But that right, this right of personal

15

liberty, the Blackstonian right, is an unregulated right

16

to whatever arm, wherever kept, however you want to

17

store it, and for the purposes an individual decides,

18

that is a libertarian ideal.

19

Second Amendment, which is expressly about the security

20

of the State; it's about well-regulated militias, not

21

unregulated individual license, as is --

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It's not the text of the

So what you are -- what you

23

are saying is that the individual has a right to

24

challenge a Federal law which in effect would disarm the

25

militia and make it impossible for the militia to
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

perform those functions that militias function.

2

that the nub of what you're saying?

3

MR. DELLINGER:

Yes.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

5

MR. DELLINGER:

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Isn't

That is correct.

Okay.
And if the Court -May ask this question,

7

Mr. Dellinger?

To what extent do you think the similar

8

provisions in State constitutions that were adopted more

9

or less at the same time are relevant to our inquiry?
MR. DELLINGER:

10

I think they are highly

11

relevant to your inquiry because now 42 States have

12

adopted constitutional provisions.

13
14

JUSTICE STEVENS:
those.
MR. DELLINGER:

15
16
17

I'm not talking about

You're talking about at the

time.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

I'm talking about the

18

contemporaneous actions of the States, before or at the

19

time of the adoption of the Second Amendment.

20

MR. DELLINGER:

I think that the -- the

21

State amendments are generally written in different --

22

in different terms.

23

of right that is -- that is being spoken of here,

24

different from the militia right, the plain language to

25

do it would be "Congress or the States shall pass no law

If you're going to protect the kind

15

abridging the right of any person to possess weapons for

3

here.

4

And that's not the right that is created

One of the troublesome aspects of viewing

5

this as a right of personal use is that that is the kind

6

of fundamental liberty interest that would create a real

7

potential for disruption.

8

untether it from its connection to the protection of the

9

State militia, you have the kind of right that could

Once you unmoor it from -- or

10

easily be restrictions on State and local governments

11

and --

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, there's no question

13

that the English struggled with how to work this.

14

couldn't conceal a gun and you also couldn't carry it,

15

but yet you had a right to have it.

16

Let me ask you this:

You

Do you think the

17

Second Amendment is more restrictive or more expansive

18

of the right than the English Bill of Rights in 1689?

19

MR. DELLINGER:

I think it doesn't address

20

the same subject matter as the English Bill of Rights.

21

I think it's related to the use of weapons as part of

22

the civic duty of participating in the common defense,

23

and it's -- and it's -- it's --

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think that would be more

restrictive.
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. DELLINGER:

That -- that could well --

2

the answer then would be --

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well isn't it -- isn't it

4

more restrictive in the sense that the English Bill of

5

Rights was a guarantee against the crown, and it did not

6

preclude Parliament from passing a statute that would

7

regulate and perhaps limit --

8

MR. DELLINGER:

Well --

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Here there is some

10

guarantee against what Congress can do.

11

MR. DELLINGER:

Parliament could regulate.

12

And Blackstone appears to approve of precisely the kinds

13

of regulations here.

14
15

Now --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The Bill of Rights only

protected the rights of protestants.

16

MR. DELLINGER:

This is correct.

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And it was suitable to

18

their conditions then as allowed by law, so it was -- it

19

was a group right and much more limited.
MR. DELLINGER:

20
21
22

I think that is -- that's

correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

And as I recall the

23

legislation against Scottish highlanders and against --

24

against Roman Catholics did use the term -- forbade them

25

to keep and bear arms, and they weren't just talking
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

about their joining militias; they were talking about

2

whether they could have arms.

3

MR. DELLINGER:

Well, the different kind of

4

right that you're talking about, to take this to the

5

question of -- of what the standard ought to be for

6

applying this, even if this extended beyond a

7

militia-based right, if it did, it sounds more like the

8

part of an expansive public or personal -- an expansive

9

personal liberty right, and if it -- if it is, I think

10

you ought to consider the effect on the 42 States who

11

have been getting along fine with State constitutional

12

provisions that do expressly protect an individual right

13

of -- of weapons for personal use, but in those States,

14

they have adopted a reasonableness standard that has

15

allowed them to sustain sensible regulation of dangerous

16

weapons.

And if you -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

reasonable about a total ban on possession?

MR. DELLINGER:

What is reasonable about a

purpose of allowing people to have guns to form a

militia.

14

I wanted you to respond if you -- unless you have done

15

so fully already, to what was the Chief Justice's

question of why, on the second assumption, this ban on

handguns, not the other part, of the District of

MR. DELLINGER:

If you assume the second,

First, in order -- the amendment speaks of a

24

well-regulated militia.

Perhaps it's the case that

25

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

AS AMICUS CURIAE

3
4

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

5

The Second Amendment to the Constitution, as

6

its text indicates, guarantees an individual right that

7

does not depend on eligibility for or service in the

8

militia.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask you a

10

preliminary question.

Do you think it has the same

11

meaning that it would have if it omitted the

12

introductory clause referring to militia?

13

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I don't think so, Justice

14

Stevens, because we don't take the position that the

15

preamble plays no role in interpreting the amendment.

16

And we would point to this court's decision in Miller,

17

for example, as an example of where the preamble can

18

play a role in determining the scope --

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So you think some weight

20

should be given to the clause.

21

question I wanted to ask you is:

22

23
24
25

GENERAL CLEMENT:

And also, the other
Does the right to keep

Oh, I suppose it probably

does define two rights that are closely related.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

There's a right to keep

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

arms and a right to bear arms?

2

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think that's the better

3

view, and a number of State courts that have interpreted

4

analogous provisions have distinguished between the two

5

rights and looked at them differently.

6

And, obviously, the term "keep" is a word

7

that I think is something of an embarrassment for an

8

effort to try to imbue every term in the operative text

9

with an exclusively military connotation because that is

10

not one that really has an exclusive military

11

connotation.

12

precisely the word that authorities used in statutes

13

designed specifically to disarm individuals.

14

As Justice Scalia pointed out, "keep" was

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It doesn't means all.

15

doesn't mean -- "keep," on your reading, at least if

16

it's consistent with Miller, keep and bear some arms,

17

but not all arms.

18

GENERAL CLEMENT:

It

Absolutely, Justice

19

Ginsburg, and just -- I mean, to give you a clear

20

example, we would take the position that the kind of

21

plastic guns or guns that are specifically designed to

22

evade metal detectors that are prohibited by Federal law

23

are not "arms" within the meaning of the Second

24

Amendment and are not protected at all.

25

And that would be the way we would say that
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you should analyze that provision of Federal law, as

2

those are not even arms within the provisions of the

3

Second Amendment.

4

I think to make the same argument about

5

machine guns would be a much more difficult argument, to

6

say the least, given that they are the standard-issue

7

weapon for today's armed forces and the State-organized

8

militia.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So in your view this

10

amendment has nothing to do with the right of people

11

living in the wilderness to protect themselves, despite

12

maybe an attempt by the Federal Government, which is

13

what the Second Amendment applies to, to take away their

14

weapons?
GENERAL CLEMENT:

15

Well, Justice Kennedy, I

16

wouldn't say that it has no application there.

17

say, I think the term "arms," especially if Miller is

18

going to continue to be the law, is influenced by the

19

preamble.

20

As I

But the way we would look at it -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I agree that Miller is

21

consistent with what you've just said, but it seems to

22

me Miller, which kind of ends abruptly as an opinion

23

writing anyway, is just insufficient to subscribe -- to

24

describe the interests that must have been foremost in

25

the framers' minds when they were concerned about guns
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

being taken away from the people who needed them for

2

their defense.

3

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Kennedy, we

4

would analyze it this way, which is we would say that

5

probably the thing that was foremost in the framers'

6

minds was a concern that the militia not be disarmed

7

such that it would be maintained as a viable option to

8

the standing army.

9

Justice Alito pointed out, that the Constitution in

But especially when you remember, as

10

Article I, Section 8, clauses 15 and 16, the militia

11

clauses, as unamended, gave the Federal power -- the

12

Federal authorities virtually plenary authority to deal

13

with the organization and regulation of the militia.

14

The most obvious way that you could protect the militia

JUSTICE STEVENS:

21

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Yes -- no, absolutely.

22

There is something reserved in clause 16.

But let me just say, if the Second Amendment

24

had the meaning that the District of Columbia ascribes

25

to it, one would certainly think that James Madison,

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Again, that is also true

and is also relatively unique to this amendment.

I get to the point in the argument where I talk about

is highly relevant in considering the threshold question

10

of whether there's an individual right here at all is

11

that the parallel provisions in the English Bill of

JUSTICE SOUTER:

May I go back to another

22

point, which is to the same point, and that is

23

consistent with your emphasis on the people was your

24

emphasis a moment ago on the distinction between keeping

25

and bearing arms.

The "keep" part sounds in your, in
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

your mind at least, to speak of an individual right not

2

necessarily limited by, by the exigencies of military

3

service.

4

My question is, if that is correct and

5

"keep" should be read as, in effect, an independent

6

guarantee, then what is served by the phrase "and bear"?

7

In other words, if the people can keep them and they

8

have them there for use in the militia as well as to

9

hunt deer, why do we -- why do we have to have a further

10

reference in there to a right to bear as well as to keep

arms?

13

to know what your answer is to that.

14

And my point is it sounds to me as though "keep

Justice Souter, is that "keep" is really talking about

"bear a gun," and so I do think in that context --

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But it's "arms" that has

20

the kind of the military -- the martial connotation, I

21

would have thought.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Wasn't -- wasn't it the

23

case that the banning of arms on the part of the

24

Scottish highlanders and of Catholics in England used

25

the term, forbade them to "bear arms"?
37
Alderson Reporting Company

It didn't mean

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that could just not join militias; it meant they

2

couldn't carry arms.

3

GENERAL CLEMENT:

And again, I think various

4

phrases were, were used.

5

disarmament provisions specifically used the word

6

"keep."

7

meaning there, which is one point.

8
9

I also think that some of the

And so I think there is some independent

And then I do think that, even in the
context of bearing arms, I will grant you that "arms"

10

has a military connotation and I think Miller would

11

certainly support that, but I don't think it's an

12

exclusively military connotation.

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Not only Miller, but the

14

Massachusetts declaration.

15

arms for the common defense" is what is the normal

16

reading of it.

17

"The right to keep and bear

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Oh, absolutely.

And I

18

grant you if this, if the Second Amendment said "keep

19

and bear arms for the common defense" this would be a

20

different case.

21

But --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

--- the right to keep and

22

bear -- I'm sorry.

23

two rights, to keep and to bear.

24
25

It's one right to keep and bear, not

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, I mean it's -- it's

my friends from the District that are emphasizing that

Alderson Reporting Company

1

no word in the Constitution is surplusage.

2

say that in a context like this you might want to focus

3

both on "keep" and on "bear arms."

4
5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So I would

And you want to talk about

the standard, and your light's on.

6

(Laughter.)

7

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Okay.

I would like to

8

talk about the standard and my light is indeed on, so

9

let me do that.

10

I think there are several reasons why a

11

standard as we suggest in our brief rather than strict

12

scrutiny is an appropriate standard to be applied in

13

evaluating these laws.

14

our colloquy earlier indicated, there is -- the right to

15

bear arms was a preexisting right.

16

talks about "the right to bear arms," not just "a right

17

to bear arms."

18

with reasonable regulations of firearms.

19

I think first and foremost, as

The Second Amendment

And that preexisting always coexisted

And as you pointed out, Justice Souter, to

20

be sure when you're making the translation from the

21

English Bill of Rights you always have to deal with

22

parliamentary supremacy.

23

as Justice Stevens said, the right was conditioned on

24

the conditions, which I think meant what class you were,

25

and also subject expressly to the Parliament, the laws

But it is very striking that,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The freedom of speech that

3

was referred to in the Constitution was also "the"

4

freedom of speech, which referred to the pre-existing

5

freedom of speech.

6

restrictions on that such as libel that you were not

7

allowed to do.

8

because it was pre-existing and that there were some

9

regulations upon it, that we would not use strict

10

scrutiny.

11

don't we?

12

And there were indeed some

And yet we've never held that simply

We certainly apply it to freedom of speech,

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Justice Scalia, let me

13

make two related points.

One, even in the First

14

Amendment context, this Court has recognized -- and I

15

point you to the Court's opinion in Robertson against

16

Baldwin, which makes this point as to both the First and

17

the Second Amendment.

18

there are certain pre-existing exceptions that are so

19

well established that you don't really even view them as

20

Second Amendment or First Amendment infringement.

This Court has recognized that

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Like libel.
Like libel, and I would

23

say like laws barring felons from possessing handguns.

24

I don't think --

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Or would you say like

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

protecting yourself against intruders in the home?

2

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, that gets to the

3

self-defense component and I don't know that I ever got

4

a chance to fully answer your question on that, Justice

5

Kennedy, which is we would say, notwithstanding the fact

6

that the preamble makes it clear that the preeminent

7

motive was related to ensuring that the militia remained

8

a viable option vis-a-vis the standing army, the

9

operative text is not so limited.

And I think in that

10

regard it's worth emphasizing that the framers knew

11

exactly how to condition a right on militia service,

12

because they did it with respect to the grand jury

13

clause, and they didn't do it with respect to the Second

14

Amendment.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

If the amendment is intended

16

at least, in part to protect the right to self-defense

17

in the home, how could the District code provision

18

survive under any standard of review where they totally

19

ban the possession of the type of weapon that's most

20

commonly used for self-defense, and even as to long guns

21

and shotguns they require, at least what the code says

22

without adding a supposed gloss that might be produced

23

in a subsequent case, that even as to long guns and

24

shotguns they have to be unloaded and disassembled or

25

locked at all times, even presumably if someone is
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

breaking into the home?

2

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Alito, let

3

me answer the question in two parts if I can, because I

4

think the analysis of the trigger lock provision may

5

well be different than the analysis of the other

6

provisions.

7

With respect to the trigger lock provision,

8

we think that there is a substantial argument that once

9

this Court clarifies what the constitutional standard

10

is, that there ought to be an opportunity for the

11

District of Columbia to urge its construction, which

12

would allow for a relatively robust self-defense

13

exception to the trigger lock provision.

14

could very well, applying Ashwan to prevent --

15

principles allow for that kind of --

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And this Court

I don't understand that.

17

What would that be -- that you can, if you have time,

18

when you hear somebody crawling in your -- your bedroom

19

window, you can run to your gun, unlock it, load it and

20

then fire?

21

Is that going to be the exception?
GENERAL CLEMENT:

If that's going to be the

22

exception, it could clearly be inadequate.

23

that -- I mean the District of Columbia can speak to

24

this, but it seems to me that if, for example, the

25

police were executing a warrant at evening and had cause
42
Alderson Reporting Company

And I think

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

for doing it at evening and saw somebody with a loaded

2

gun on their night stand, no children present without a

3

trigger lock, it seems to me that that would be a good

4

test case to decide whether or not their construction

5

would provide for an exception to the trigger lock

6

provision in that case.

7
8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can I interrupt for a

minute?
GENERAL CLEMENT:

If it did, I think then

10

the statute might well be constitutional.

11

in my view, it probably wouldn't be.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If it didn't,

There is a lot of talk

13

about standards and stop words like strict scrutiny.

14

Does it make a practical difference whether we take your

15

standard or the strict scrutiny that was in the D.C.

16

Circuit's opinion?

17

panoply of Federal laws restricting gun possession.

18

Would any of them be jeopardized under your standard?

19

And the same question with the District scrutiny, does

20

it make any difference?

21

And specifically there is a whole

GENERAL CLEMENT:

In our view it makes a

22

world of difference, Justice Ginsburg, because we

23

certainly take the position, as we have since

24

consistently since 2001, that the Federal firearm

25

statutes can be defended as constitutional, and that
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would be consistent with this kind of intermediate

2

scrutiny standard that we propose.

3

scrutiny, I think that the result would be quite

4

different, unfortunately.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If you apply strict

Well, these various

6

phrases under the different standards that are proposed,

7

"compelling interest," "significant interest," "narrowly

8

tailored," none of them appear in the Constitution; and

9

I wonder why in this case we have to articulate an

10

all-encompassing standard.

11

the scope of the existing right that the amendment

12

refers to, look at the various regulations that were

13

available at the time, including you can't take the gun

14

to the marketplace and all that, and determine how

15

these -- how this restriction and the scope of this

16

right looks in relation to those?

17

Isn't it enough to determine

I'm not sure why we have to articulate some

18

very intricate standard.

19

apply in the First Amendment just kind of developed over

20

the years as sort of baggage that the First Amendment

21

picked up.

22

afresh, we would try to articulate a whole standard that

23

would apply in every case?

24
25

I mean, these standards that

But I don't know why when we are starting

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice,

let me say a couple of things about that, which is to
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

say that if this Court were to decide this case and make

2

conclusively clear that it really was focused very

3

narrowly on this case and it was in some respects

4

applying a sui generis test, we think that would be an

5

improvement over the court of appeals opinion, which is

6

subject to more than one reading, but as Justice

7

Ginsburg's question just said, it's certainly

8

susceptible to a reading that it embodies strict

9

scrutiny.

10

In fact -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, it did.

11

it's just like the First Amendment.

12

exceptions, but strict scrutiny applies.

13

scrutiny applies here too.

14

GENERAL CLEMENT:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It said

First Amendment has
It says strict

I -But that opinion also, it

I don't know what you're

Machine guns, what else?

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Is there any

Armored

Well, Justice Scalia, I

24

think our principal concern based on the parts of the

25

court of appeals opinion that seemed to adopt a very
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

categorical rule were with respect to machine guns,

2

because I do think that it is difficult -- I don't want

3

to foreclose the possibility of the Government, Federal

4

Government making the argument some day -- but I think

5

it is more than a little difficult to say that the one

6

arm that's not protected by the Second Amendment is that

7

which is the standard issue armament for the National

8

Guard, and that's what the machine gun is.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But this law didn't

10

involve a restriction on machine guns.

11

absolute ban.

12

prohibition.

13

striking down an absolute ban would also apply to a

14

narrow one -- narrower one directed solely to machine

15

guns?

16

It involved an

It involved an absolute carry
Why would you think that the opinion

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think, Mr. Chief

17

Justice, why one might worry about that is one might

18

read the language of page 53a of the opinion as

19

reproduced in the petition appendix that says once it is

20

an arm, then it is not open to the District to ban it.

21

Now, it seems to me that the District is not

22

strictly a complete ban because it exempts pre-1976

23

handguns.

24

strictly speaking, a ban, because it exempts pre --

25

pre-law machine guns, and there is something like

The Federal ban on machine guns is not,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that passage doesn't

mean once it's an arm in the dictionary definition of

4

arms.

5

the opinion referred to it, which is -- which is the

6

type of a weapon that was used in militia, and it is --

7

it is nowadays commonly held.

Once it's an arm in the specialized sense that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10
11

Well -If you read it that way, I

don't see why you have a problem.
GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, I -- I hope that you

12

read it that way.

13

that whatever the definition that the lower court

14

opinion employed, I do think it's going to be difficult

15

over time to sustain the notion -- I mean, the Court of

16

Appeals also talked about lineal descendants.

17

does seem to me that, you know, just as this Court would

18

apply the Fourth Amendment to something like heat

19

imagery, I don't see why this Court wouldn't allow the

20

Second Amendment to have the same kind of scope, and

21

then I do think that reasonably machine guns come within

22

the term "arms."

23

But I would also say that I think

Now, if this Court wants to say that they

don't -- I mean -- I mean -- we'd obviously welcome that

The one other thing I would say is that this

is an opinion that is susceptible of different readings.

All 50 states allow law-abiding citizens to

I'd like to respond to the

point about the -- the District of Columbia's position

25

over the years with respect to the functional firearms
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

ban.
The Petitioners have had two opportunities

3

to urge courts to adopt this so-called self-defense

4

exception which they construed in the amendment.

5

first opportunity came in 1978 in McIntosh versus

6

Washington, where the petitioners urged the Court of

7

Appeals of the District of Columbia to uphold the law

8

because it was irrational in their view to prohibit

9

self-defense in the home with firearms.

The

They deemed it

10

to be too dangerous, and this was a legitimate policy

11

choice of the City Council, and they actually prevailed

12

in that view.

13

The second opportunity that the Petitioners

14

had to urge this sort of self-defense construction was

15

actually in this case in the district court.

16

motion for summary judgment and we made certain factual

17

allegations in this motion, and on page 70a of the joint

18

appendix we see portions of our statement of undisputed

19

material facts.

20

the District of Columbia, reads:

21

prohibit the possession of lawfully owned firearms for

22

self-defense within the home, even in instances when

23

self-defense would be lawful by other means under

24

District of Columbia law.

25

functional firearms ban, and that point was conceded.

We had a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Certainly the idea that people can guess as

2

to when it is that they might render the firearm

3

operational is -- is not a one that the Court should

4

accept, because a person who hears a noise, a person who

5

perhaps is living in a neighborhood where there has been

6

a spate of violent crimes, has no idea of when the

7

District of Columbia would permit her to render the

8

firearm operational.

9

prosecution history not under this specific provision,

10

but certainly other under gun prohibition -- laws that

11

we are challenging here today to prosecute people for

12

the possession or for the carrying of a prohibited

13

firearm even when the police ruled the shooting has been

14

lawful self-defense.

15

And, in fact, there is a

JUSTICE BREYER:

You're saying that this is

16

unreasonable, and that really is my question because I'd

17

like you to assume two things with me, which you

18

probably don't agree with, and I may not agree with

19

them, either.

20

(Laughter.)

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22
23

But I just want you to

assume them for the purpose of the question.

All right.

Assume that the -- that there is an

24

individual right, but the purpose of that right is to

25

maintain a citizen army; call it a militia; that that's
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the basic purpose.

2

what isn't reasonable.

3

So it informs what's reasonable and

Assume -- and this is favorable to you but

4

not as favorable as you'd like -- assume that we are

5

going to decide whether something is proportionate or

6

apply an intermediate standard in light of the purpose.

7

All right.

8
9

Now, focus on the handgun ban.

As I read

these 80 briefs -- and they were very good, I mean

10

really good and informative on both sides -- and I'm

11

trying to boil down the statistics where there is

12

disagreement, and roughly what I get -- and don't

13

quarrel with this too much; it's very rough -- that

14

80,000 to 100,000 people every year in the United States

15

are either killed or wounded in gun-related homicides or

16

crimes or accidents or suicides, but suicide is more

17

questionable.

18

That's why I say 80,000 to 100,000.

In the District, I guess the number is

19

somewhere around 200 to 300 dead; and maybe, if it's

20

similar, 1,500 to 2,000 people wounded.

21

All right.

Now, in light of that, why isn't a ban on

22

handguns, while allowing the use of rifles and muskets,

23

a reasonable or a proportionate response on behalf of

24

the District of Columbia?

25

MR. GURA:

Because, Your Honor, for the same
51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reason it was offered by numerous military officers at

2

the highest levels of the U.S. military in all branches

3

of service writing in two briefs, they agree with us

4

that the handgun ban serves to weaken America's military

5

preparedness.

6

handguns are military arms, they are not just civilian

7

arms -- they are better prepared and able to use them.

8

And, certainly, when they join the military forces, they

9

are issued handguns.

10

Because when people have handguns --

And so if we assume that the sort of

11

military purpose to the Second Amendment is an

12

individual right, then the handgun ban, as noted by our

13

military amici, would impede that.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I didn't read -- I

15

read the two military briefs as focusing on the nature

16

of the right, which was quite a pretty good argument

17

there that the nature of the right is to maintain a

18

citizen Army.

19

And to maintain that potential today, the

20

closest we come is to say that there is a right for

21

people to understand weapons, to know how to use them,

22

to practice with them.

23

with their rifles.

24

in neighboring States.

25

And they can do that, you see,

They can go to gun ranges, I guess,

But does that make it unreasonable for a
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

city with a very high crime rate, assuming that the

2

objective is what the military people say, to keep us

3

ready for the draft, if necessary, is it unreasonable

4

for a city with that high crime rate to say no handguns

5

here?

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You want to say yes.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, why?

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's your answer.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, you want to say yes,

10

that's correct, but I want to hear what the reasoning is

11

because there is a big crime problem.

12

getting you to focus on that.

13

MR. GURA:

I'm simply

The answer is yes, as Justice

14

Scalia noted, and it's unreasonable, and it actually

15

fails any standard of review that might be offered under

16

such a construction of individual rights because

17

proficiency with handguns, as recognized as a matter of

18

judicial notice by the First Circuit in Cases back in

19

1942 -- that was a handgun case where the First Circuit

20

examined the restriction on the carrying of the

21

30-caliber revolver.

22

a matter of judicial notice, that proficiency in use and

23

familiarity with the handgun at issue would be one that

24

would further a militia purpose.

25

And the First Circuit accepted, as

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And so --

Let me ask this question:

53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

In answering yes, do you attach any significance to the

2

reference to the militia in the Second Amendment?

3

MR. GURA:

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You think that is -- to

5

understand the amendment, you must pay some attention to

6

the militia requirement?

7

MR. GURA:

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

Yes, Your Honor, we must -So a conscientious

objector who likes to hunt deer for food, you would say,

has no rights under the Second Amendment.

He is not

going to be part of the militia.

12

part of the common defense, but he still wants to bear

13

arms.

14

under this amendment?

15

MR. GURA:

He is not going to be

You would say that he doesn't have any rights

No, Your Honor.

I think that the

16

militia clause informs the purpose -- informs a purpose.

It gives us some guidepost as to how we look at the

Second Amendment, but it's not the exclusive purpose of

19

Certainly, the Founders cared

Is it a limitation?

MR. GURA:

It is a limitation to one extent,

Your Honor, the extent recognized in Miller where the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Miller Court asked whether or not a particular type of

2

arm that's at issue is one that people may individually

3

possess.

4

therefore, adopted a militia purpose as one of the two

5

prongs of Miller.

6

It looked to the militia clause and,

And so, certainly, if there were -- if the

7

Court were to continue Miller -- and Miller was the only

8

guidance that the lower court had, certainly, as to what

9

arms are protected or unprotected by the Second

10
11

Amendment.

And yet -JUSTICE STEVENS:

If it limits the kinds of

12

arms to be appropriate to a militia, why does it not

13

also limit the kind of people who may have arms?

14

MR. GURA:

It does not eliminate the kind of

15

It says that the gun in question

MR. GURA:

That's correct.

The time frame

that the Court must address is always the present.

They wished to preserve the ability of people to

say, a technical obsolescence.

strongly about the fact that people were expected to

point to be that, although that's useful in modern

military service, it's not something civilians possess.

15

Was there anything like that at the time of the

adoption, or were the civilian arms exactly the same as

17

the ones you'd use in the military?

18

In other words, I understand your

MR. GURA:

At the time that -- even at the

19

time Miller was decided, the civilian arms were pretty

20

much the sort that were used in the military.

21

it's hard to imagine how a machine gun could be a

22

"lineal descendent," to use the D.C. Circuit's wording,

23

of anything that existed back in 1791, if we want to

24

look to the framing era.

Alderson Reporting Company

seems to me to be allowing the militia clause to make no

And, on the other hand, everything that

use -- handguns, rifles, and shotguns -- are militarily

MR. GURA:

But

10

what we've seen with the Fourteenth Amendment, and we've

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But the time we're talking

about, the firearms in the home ordinance, when was

that?

MR. GURA:

1783 I believe was the statute.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

How do you explain the

fact that you include self-defense, but only two States,

Pennsylvania and Vermont, did refer to self-defense as a

permissible justification and all of the others referred

to common defense or defense of the State, and in the

Articles of Confederation and the Constitution itself

22

there is no reference to self-defense?

23

MR. GURA:

Your Honor, the State courts

25

different interpretation.

judges did not interpret them that way, for example in

But the text itself does draw a distinction, just

MR. GURA:

It doesn't mention

While it might not mention

20

self-defense, it was clear that the demands that the

21

States made at the ratifying conventions were for an

22

individual right, and Madison was interested in --

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, if you look at the

24

individual rights I suppose you start back in 1689, the

Declaration of Rights in England.

Alderson Reporting Company

your -- you would not confine the right the way the

recognize an individual right of self-defense or hunting

about the power of the national government and the

didn't limit it to self-defense.

I mean, what provoked

it, as I understand it, was concern about the militia

clauses, and here I mean you're certainly correct.

25

agree with you.

Pennsylvania went beyond that.
69
Alderson Reporting Company

It

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

was -- it was one of three States, as I understand, that

2

did go beyond it.

3

the subject, as I understand it, was, in each instance

4

including Pennsylvania, concern over the national

5

government's power over militias under Article 1.

But the provocation for getting into

6

MR. GURA:

Justice Souter, we wouldn't see

7

the history that way.

8

the militia clauses in the Constitution were

9

controversial.

Certainly there is agreement that

And there were separate amendments that

10

were proposed and always rejected that would have

11

addressed that explicitly.

12

Virginia's proposals, it's agreed by the Petitioners

13

that Virginia was the model for the Bill of Rights and

14

specifically, of course, for the Second Amendment.

In fact, if we look at

We saw one set of proposed amendments from

15

Virginia entitled Bill of Rights, and the Second

speaks exactly to the -- reverting control over the

were easily agreeable to because the right to keep and

not have altered the structure of our Constitution, and

so those were agreed to quite readily.

said you can't store the gunpowder anywhere but on the

top floor.

similar to those?

17

Why isn't the modern trigger-lock provision

self-defense in the home.

always a risk that the children will get up and grab the

firearm and use it for some purpose other than what the

MR. GURA:

Oddly enough, a child can access

mean, you don't necessarily expect a young child to be

6

able to reassemble the pistol.

7

MR. GURA:

That's true, Your Honor.

8

However, better safe storage approach is the one used by

the majority of jurisdictions, I believe, that do have

limitation.

13

Whatever standard of view we may wish to apply, I think,

would encompass a safe storage provision.

15

And that is a reasonable

It's a strict scrutiny limitation.

But this is not a safe storage provision

16

because we have specific exceptions that allow you to

actually use the firearm in recreational shooting and

18

also in a place of business.

19

history from Washington, D.C., that tells us that we are

not supposed to have an operable firearm for purposes of

self-defense because they simply do not trust people to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If it's a fundamental

right, what about licensing?

about trigger locks, we've talked about the ban on

handguns, but there is also a requirement that there be

a license for possession of a handgun.

right on the first question, that you couldn't flatly

ban handguns, what about a requirement that you obtain a

You wouldn't put it that

MR. GURA:

13

That's another way to look at it,

Certainly -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- you would define

14

"reasonable" in light of the restrictions that existed

at the time the amendment was adopted.

MR. GURA:

Those restrictions --

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You know, you can't

that would be -- we are talking about lineal descendents

20

of the arms but presumably there are lineal descendents

21

of the restrictions as well.

22

MR. GURA:

So

Framing our practices would

23

inform the kind of restrictions that would be accepted.

But even beyond that, they also inform the contours of

25

the right.

2

that that court has examined the Second Amendment when

5

people simply are outside the right, as historically

6

understood in our country.

aspect to remember, that the Second Amendment is part of

our common law tradition, and we look to framing our

No, Your Honor, the fact is that

11

we can always debate these things, but the object of the

14

normative arguments about many provisions of the

Constitution.

16

well, we've decided as a matter of policy that the right

17

to keep and bear arms is no longer a good idea and,

therefore, we are going to have restrictions that

violate that stricture in the Bill of Rights, that
