CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

next in Case 06-1509, Boulware v. United States.

5

Mr. Cline.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. CLINE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. CLINE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Congress placed the phrase "with respect to

11

its stock" in Section 301(a) of the Internal Revenue

12

Code to make clear that the taxation rules in Section

13

301(c) do not apply to corporate payments that a

14

shareholder receives in a nonshareholder capacity.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

May I ask you a question

16

which is going to come up sooner or later?

And it's

17

kind of a threshold question.

18

interrupt you with it now.

19

significance of the limiting condition "with respect to

20

the stock."

21

301 refers to a distribution by the corporation.

22

question is this:

23

your -- your position that the circuit was wrong in

24

requiring an offer of proof of intent to return capital.

25

Isn't it also the case that you would still have an

So, if I may, let me

You emphasize the

But before you get to that phrase, Section
And my

Let's assume that we -- we accept

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

obligation, if you're going to take advantage of this

2

section, to offer some evidence with respect to the fact

3

that there was a corporate distribution involved?

4

as I understand it, your evidence is or the Government's

5

evidence and yours is that, you know, there was

6

skimming, there was misdirection, et cetera, but there

7

was no indication, there's no evidence that there was

8

any distribution, in the normal sense of that word, by a

9

corporation.

And

10

So it seems to me that if you -- if you win

11

the case in the sense of convincing us that the circuit

12

was wrong with respect to the specific intent

13

requirement, you would still be left without a defense

14

because you have not come forward with any evidence that

15

indicates a distribution.

16
17

MR. CLINE:

Yes, Your Honor, I believe you

are.

18
19

Am I wrong?

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I thought you were going to

say that.

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. CLINE:

Although I agree that the

22

question of a distribution is important, and I think

23

implicit in that question, in that term, although the

24

courts have not addressed it, is some sort of corporate

25

action.

Where you have a controlling shareholder, as we
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

do here with Mr. Boulware, who is a 50 percent share

2

owner, he's the president, he's the founder, he

3

dominates this company, his action is action on behalf

4

of the corporation.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it certainly can be,

6

and there's no question about that, but isn't there some

7

point of informality or some point, I guess, of

8

formality or relevance to corporate practice that has to

9

be reached?

In other words, he may keep lousy books, he

10

may be very sloppy, but directing funds to one's

11

girlfriend is not the act of a corporation.

12

seems to me that the kind of -- of actions that he took

13

to get or to direct the payment of moneys could not, by

14

any stretch of the imagination, be regarded as an act of

15

this corporation or of any corporation.

16

MR. CLINE:

And it

With respect, Justice Souter,

17

Justice Souter, I disagree.

18

hundreds of corporate diversion cases involving a very

19

similar fact pattern and a very similar fact pattern to

20

this, where have you a corporation that is really the

21

creature of one person.

22

chose the corporate form, but in effect he is the

23

corporation.

24

the case in a lot of these diversion cases, and -

25

There are, I've discovered,

It's formed by one person.

He

That's the case of Mr. Boulware and it's

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, in this case, he's a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

50 percent owner, as I understand it.

2

corporation, but isn't 50 percent of the stock owned by

3

the trust for the love child of him and the girlfriend?

4

MR. CLINE:

He formed the

It is indeed, although it's

5

important to keep in mind that the girlfriend, according

6

to the Government's evidence, received a very large

7

chunk of this money.

8

a situation where you not only have a 50 percent

9

shareholder who dominates the corporation; the other 50

So in effect what we have here is

10

percent -- the trustee for the other 50 percent

11

shareholder is the recipient of the money and is

12

certainly knowledgeable about most, if not all, of

13

what's going on.

14

But in these circumstances where you have a

15

close corporation typically run very informally, as this

16

one was, with one person who dominates it, the courts

17

have uniformly taken the view that, the Tax Court has

18

and for that matter the Government has in every case

19

except this one, that when the controlling dominant

20

shareholder takes money from his corporation, that's a

21

distribution by the corporation.

22

Honor, I had thought about this question myself before

23

you raised it.

24

They move directly to the question of whether it's taken

25

in some other capacity, as compensation, for example, or

And although -- Your

The cases don't pause on that issue.

as a loan.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, perhaps because -

3

because the Government might very well be on the other

4

side of that question, that is the dominant shareholder

5

takes money from the corporation, gives it to his

6

girlfriend, and the Government is saying that

7

corporation had earnings and profits, we want to tax

8

this as a dividend to you.

9

MR. CLINE:

Well, yes, Justice Ginsburg.

10

The way this often comes up, the Government usually

11

takes the opposite position -

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

MR. CLINE:

Yes.

-- to what it's taken here.

It

14

usually takes our position, and here's the reason why:

15

First of all, a lot of times, as in this case, some of

16

the money that is coming toward the corporation is

17

intercepted by the controlling shareholder.

18

question then is, was it ever income to the corporation?

19

Well, of course, the Government wants to say that it was

20

because they want to tax it twice, at the corporate

21

level and then again at the individual level.

22

issue there again is one of control.

23

controlling shareholder, even though he gets the money

24

before it ever hits the corporate bank account.

25

considered income to the corporation.
7
Alderson Reporting Company

And the

And the

If it's the

It's

It also comes up when the corporation wants

2

to claim a theft deduction or embezzlement deduction.

3

That again is a common fact pattern in these cases.

5

conducts its investigation, now the corporation wants to

9

shareholder and it's entitled to a deduction and

10

The

shouldn't have to pay tax on that money.

11

And again, the Government uniformly takes

12

the position that a controlling shareholder, such as

13

Mr. Boulware, can't embezzle from his own corporation,

14

which is essentially the position that we're taking

15

here.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it may be that he

17

cannot embezzle in the sense of committing a separate

18

private act or even a separate, a separate tort that the

19

corporation could object to.

20

remains -- excuse me -- whether the act of, of taking

21

the money in this unorthodox way could be regarded as a

22

corporate act within the meaning of the term

23

"distribution."

24

but I guess the only point that I'm making is the fact

25

that it may not qualify as embezzlement, civilly or

But the question still

And I think I understand your point,

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

criminally, does not necessarily answer the objection

2

that I'm raising.

3
4

MR. CLINE:

I agree with that point, Justice

Souter.

5

But one other point I would emphasize is

6

that I think if you start to say that an act by the

7

controlling shareholder, which is Mr. Boulware, does not

8

constitute a distribution by his corporation, there are

9

going to be unintended consequences of that.

One of

10

which is that in a situation where a controlling

11

shareholder such as Mr. Boulware intercepts money coming

12

into the corporation, you're going to have the

13

corporation coming in and arguing that that

14

interception, that taking in of money wasn't an act of

15

the corporation, and so, there is no income to us.

16

I think that's why the courts in a whole series -

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And

That explains why I'm

18

making the argument and the Government wasn't in its

19

brief?

20

MR. CLINE:

I think it does.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you did say something

22

about the interception that -- your argument is that

23

this corporation had no earnings and profits, so what

24

the shareholder got was a return of capital.

25

of what was involved was he was taking, I thought,
9
Alderson Reporting Company

But part

receipts for goods that customers were -- had paid and

2

giving them to the girlfriend.

3

In determining whether that corporation had

4

any earnings and profits, wouldn't you have to credit

5

the corporation?

6

there was no -- that there were no earnings and profits?

7

You would have to prove that, wouldn't you?

8
9

In other words, did you prove that

MR. CLINE:

The way I believe it would work

with a properly instructed jury in the district court is

10

as follows:

11

of coming forward with some evidence that the

12

corporation did not have earnings or profits and that

13

his basis exceeded the amount of the diversion.

14

at that point, if he comes forward with some evidence,

15

and Bok talks about this, Leonard talks about this -

16
17

I think Mr. Boulware would have the burden

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think

For which purpose you'd

include the receipts?

18

MR. CLINE:

I beg your pardon?

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

For which purpose you would

20

include the receipts that he sent to his girlfriend

21

instead of putting them in the corporate treasury?

22

MR. CLINE:

Your Honor, I believe that is

23

correct, but I'm not certain.

What I can tell you about

24

earnings and profits and basis as well is this.

25

very complicated calculation, and I think it would be

Alderson Reporting Company

It is a

3

earnings and profits and that Mr. Boulware's basis is

less than he contends it is.

MR. CLINE:

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

But what is in the record, and it's also in the joint

appendix, is the fairly sketchy evidence of both basis

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Government or by the defendant?

21

MR. CLINE:

It came in -- I must say it came

22

in more or less by happenstance, because neither party

23

was really looking at the question of earnings and

24

profits or basis because the trial court had ruled those

out.

But, for example, on cross-examination I believe

That was not explored at

But there is that statement in the record.

6

There is also -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm not, I'm not sure if

what the Government is maintaining here is so

9

prejudicial to its position in other cases, which was

10

the earlier discussion we were having.

11

simply nothing on the corporate records to show that

this was a distribution with respect to stock.

care whether this is earnings and profits or in excess

distribution with respect to stock, and you have two

shareholders.

But there's just no indication of the

Under Hawaiian law, can you make a

MR. CLINE:

I think it is entirely possible

21

that under Hawaiian law a minority shareholder or

22

noncontrolling shareholder who was treated unfairly by

23

the controlling shareholder might have a cause of action

24

under State law.

25

But I -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That was, that was the

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

qualification that the Second Circuit made in its

2

D'Agostino case.

3

corporate law then our rule doesn't apply.

4

It said if there's a violation of

MR. CLINE:

Well, except, Your Honor, that

5

the way these cases have played out is that there are

6

numerous cases, dozens of them, where there are minority

7

shareholders oftentimes unwitting of what the majority

8

shareholder is using.

9

certainly have rights.

10

Those minority shareholders
They can sue under State law.

They can do any number of things.

11

But their rights and the possible violation

12

of their rights -- and I emphasize possible, because no

13

one has ever established that Mr. Boulware did anything

14

wrong with respect to anyone -- those don't drive the

15

Federal tax treatment.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but that's the whole

17

point.

18

distribution indicates that he couldn't do this under

19

Federal law, so it must be something -- under State law,

20

so it must be something other than a distribution.

21

The fact that he doesn't show this as a

MR. CLINE:

I think, Your Honor, that where

22

the controlling shareholder of the corporation does

23

something with corporate funds, and in this case

24

transfers them to himself, I think that's a

25

distribution.

And I think that it is properly treated
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

under Federal law, under Federal tax law, for purposes

2

of Federal tax law as a distribution by the corporation.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm less concerned with the

4

word "distribution" in the statute than I am with the

5

phrase "with respect to its stock" -- "distribution made

6

by a corporation to a shareholder with respect to its

7

stock."

8
9

Now, the court below held that there had to
be a conscious intent to return capital.

Even if I

10

disagree with that and think that that was wrong, isn't

11

the Government right that it nonetheless is the burden

12

to establish that the distribution here was a

13

distribution with respect to stock, and the distribution

14

was given to the girlfriend who owns no stock in the

15

corporation.

16

respect to stock?

17

How does it become a distribution with

MR. CLINE:

Well, Your Honor, that gets back

18

to where I -- to where I began the argument.

19

"with respect to stock" has never received in any case

20

or any argument, as far as I know, the significance that

21

the Government is trying to accord it here.

22

phrase -- it was put in the 1954 Code.

of putting it in the code was simply to distinguish

I mean,

4

why doesn't it distinguish a girlfriend as much as it

MR. CLINE:

Because the issue, Your Honor,

is not the recipient of the funds.

regardless of where he diverted it.

I mean, the money is

For example, there

10

are again dozens of these cases where controlling

shareholders divert corporate assets to their family

12

members, and the issue is whether it's a constructive

13

dividend to that corporate shareholder.

question, regardless of where Mr. Boulware -

they're really between a rock and a hard place on this

stuff.

MR. CLINE:

Well, because, Your Honor, they

person in Mr. Boulware's situation, to pay tax.

2

MR. CLINE:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What -

I suppose it would

4

be open on remand for the Government to argue it was not

5

with respect to stock for the reasons that have come

6

out, that it was just a diversion?

7

MR. CLINE:

8

but, Mr. Chief Justice, I have to say I -

The Government could argue that,

won't.

11

MR. CLINE:

I would be astounded if they

12

took that position, because it would be so contrary to

13

the position they take in every other case.

14

But to get back to your basic point, yes,

Mr. Boulware was asked to meet a standard that no one

Those sorts of corporate formalities are not

determinative, or even particularly helpful, in these

Well, under the

13

Government's intent test, I suppose if you have a

14

calendar year and the distribution is made in June, that

the Government could say:

16

want you to show that there was an intent to make a

distribution with respect to stock at that time.

25

I suppose they could try to argue

MR. CLINE:

That is what they're arguing.

Now, two things about that Justice Kennedy:
First, that's not the standard Mr. Boulware

18
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

standard there was intent that it be a return of

capital.

3

that it be with respect to stock.

4

And that's a different thing than an intent

An intent that it be a return of capital

5

suggests that you know what a return of capital is.

6

know about earnings and profits.

7

And I can tell you that Mr. Boulware, who was an

8

unsophisticated man, didn't know any of those things at

9

the time; and so, of course, he couldn't meet the

10

standard he was required to meet.

11

could meet that standard.

He was never given the opportunity to meet

And he knew he was getting it because he

was a stockholder.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD

21

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

22

25

MS. MAYNARD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In the Government's view, to make a
sufficient proffer of a return of capital defense a
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Defendant must point to some factual evidence to support

2

three elements:

3

First, that there was a distribution with

4

respect to stock.

5

earnings and profits during the relevant tax years.

6

And, third, that the Defendant had a sufficient basis in

7

his stock to cover the funds received.

8
9

The question before this Court relates to
the first element.

10
11

Second, that the corporation lacked

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The court below didn't give

him a chance -

12

MS. MAYNARD:

No, Your Honor.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- to establish that.

The

14

court below required him to show an intent to distribute

15

capital.

16

MS. MAYNARD:

And the Government here

17

believes that the correct test is the rule of the Ninth

18

Circuit, Your Honor.

19

before a defendant may present a return of capital

20

defense to the jury, there must be some evidence that

21

the corporation intended, as objectively inferred from

22

all the facts and circumstances, to make a distribution

23

with respect to its stock at the time the funds were

24

taken.

25

The Government believes that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if it turned out that

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there were earnings and profits and everything else was

2

the same, would the Government be taking the position

3

that the proper test is:

4

respect to stock?

5

MS. MAYNARD:

Was this a distribution with

In -- in every case, Your

6

Honor, the question about whether or not the Section 301

7

tax treatment applies, the Government believes that

8

turns on all the facts and circumstances and that there

9

must be some facts and circumstances suggesting that it

10

was a distribution with respect to stock.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Suppose the government -

12

the corporation is rich with earnings and profits.

13

Would the Government be saying:

14

go through the motions of first seeing was this a

15

distribution with respect to stock?

16

Oh, aha.

So we have to

I thought that the idea of was it "a

17

distribution with respect to stock" refers to was it -

18

was the corporation -- was there to be any quid pro quo?

19

That is, the shareholder gets money from the

20

corporation.

21

back, or is it just that it comes out of the corporation

22

into the shareholder's pocket with no expectation by the

23

corporation to get it back?

Is the shareholder expected to pay it

24

I thought that that's what "with respect to

25

stock" means instead of "with respect to salary," "with
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

respect to a loan."

2

understanding of the term.

3

That's what I thought was the

MS. MAYNARD:

Am I wrong about it?
That is half of the

4

understanding of the term.

5

Petitioner says, a term of art.

6

the term of art with respect to stock, Your Honor.

7

I do think it is, as
There are two parts to

It is, as you say, funds that you receive

8

without consideration.

9

receive solely because of your status as a shareholder.

10

But it is also funds that you

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that was -- we're just

11

not on the same page here.

12

decision you're defending said.

13

That's not what the -- the

The decision you're defending did not say

14

that it was incumbent on the defendant to show that it

15

was with respect to stock.

16

on the defendant to show that it was intended to be a

17

return of capital.

They said it was incumbent

18

MS. MAYNARD:

Well, that's -

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's just a wholly

20

different issue, and it seems to me the best you can get

21

out of this case, the way you're arguing it, is a remand

22

for them to apply the proper test.

23

MS. MAYNARD:

I think the test that I'm

24

articulating is the Ninth Circuit's test in this

25

circumstance, Your Honor.

In Miller, which is the
23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

genesis of the Ninth Circuit's test, the court said -

2

and this is on page 545 at 1214 -- "We, therefore,

3

conclude that whether diverted funds constitute

4

constructive corporate distributions" -- and that would

5

include dividends, return of capital, or capital gain -

6

"depends on the factual circumstances involved in each

7

case under consideration."

8

And then it went on to say, before a

9

defendant could proffer a defense of return of capital,

10

the taxpayer had to make some demonstration that this -

11

such distributions were intended to be such a return of

12

capital -

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, it depends on what

14

you mean by that.

15

what he has to show, that he has to show not merely that

16

the funds could have been a return of capital, but that

17

the funds were, in fact, the return of capital "at the

18

time of transfer."

19

The Ninth Circuit said, quote, about

Then, they go on to say, since there was no

20

evidence that they were considered, intended or recorded

21

on the corporate records as a return of capital at the

22

time they were made, then it isn't a return of capital.

23

Now, I thought everybody thinks that's

24

wrong, because you might have an absolute distribution

25

that absolutely counts as a distribution to every
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

shareholder in the corporation.

2

all think the company's going to make a billion dollars,

3

but it just turns out that they have a loss of a billion

4

dollars, in which case at the end of the tax year that

5

would count as a return of capital if the basis were

6

high enough, and it would not count as a dividend.

7

wrong?

8
9

MS. MAYNARD:

No.

And at the time they

Am I

You may not know at the

time the funds are paid whether or not that -

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right, fine.

So if we

11

do not know, that's the end of the Ninth Circuit test,

12

isn't it?

13

want to do is to look at the books at the time of the

14

distribution and see if it is entered on those books as

15

a return of capital.

Because the Ninth Circuit test says:

That's how I read it.

16

MS. MAYNARD:

17

be more accurate to say:

18

as objectively manifested from all the facts and

19

circumstances, to be a distribution -

20

What we

At the time, was it intended,

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

No.

It was not.

21

they thought at the time they distributed it was

22

fabulous dividends because we are going to be rich.

23

MS. MAYNARD:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

made a little mistake.

What

But if My example was they just

Instead, the corporation is
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

close to bankrupt, so there are no earnings or profits.

2

Is it then a return of capital or not?

3
4

MS. MAYNARD:

It could be a return of

capital depending on the person's stock.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

The basis?

6

than enough basis.

7

So there is no problem about that.

8
9

He has a $14 trillion basis, okay?

MS. MAYNARD:

But here he -- the defendant

--

10
11

He has more

JUSTICE BREYER:
return of capital.

12

All right.

And so it is a

So, therefore, the test is wrong.

MS. MAYNARD:

It would be a return -- but

13

the point, Your Honor, is that the test is whether or

14

not at the time the funds were taken, the corporation

15

intended to be making a distribution with respect to its

16

stock.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, aren't you -- aren't

18

you saying not that the -- that the test of intent that

19

the Ninth Circuit used is, in itself, a sufficient test;

20

but that, rather -- and correct me if I'm wrong, because

21

I thought this was the basis really of your argument.

22

I thought the Government, in effect, was

23

saying in order to treat it as a return of capital, it

24

is a necessary condition that it be intended to be

25

treated as a return of capital.
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

But that is not a sufficient condition,

2

because if, in fact, it turns out, as in Justice

3

Breyer's example, that there are no earnings, then under

4

301 it can't be treated as -- as a dividend.

5

then, under 301, would it be treated as a return of

6

capital.

7

And only

So the conditions are, No. 1 necessary

8

intent; No. 2, a determination at the end of the year

9

that, in fact, there were no earnings.

10

Conversely, if at the end of the year there

11

are profits, even though the first necessary condition,

12

intent, was satisfied, under 301 that would not be

13

enough; and the Government would treat it as income.

14

Isn't that the nub of your position?

15

MS. MAYNARD:

16

If it were with respect to

stock and there were -

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

18

MS. MAYNARD:

19

Yes.

Yes.

-- earning profits, and it was

then income -

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I doubt that.

Then -

21

then, you would say, when it is not a criminal

22

prosecution for failure to pay taxes, so long as

23

somebody, when they take the money, intended it to be a

24

return of dividends, it does not become a return of

25

capital.

Are you sure you're willing to live with that
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2
3
4

intent requirement?
MS. MAYNARD:

If at the time the corporation

made a distribution, Your Honor JUSTICE SCALIA:

At the time -- is it

5

important for the tax treatment that at the time of the

6

distribution it be intended to be either a return of

7

capital or dividends?

8

to whether you're going to be able to tax it or not?

9

Does that make the difference as

MS. MAYNARD:

It depends in all cases, in

10

both criminal and civil cases -- and in that sense the

11

Government doesn't agree with the Ninth Circuit's

12

reasoning -- in all cases whether or not something gets

13

the tax treatment set forth in 301(a) depends on whether

14

or not it's a distribution with respect to stock.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

talking about distribution.

17
18
19
20
21

MS. MAYNARD:

Well, I'm not -- we are not

Okay, I'm sorry.

I

misunderstood your question.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

We are talking about the

intent that it be a return of capital or not.
MS. MAYNARD:

If it -- - if the

22

Government -- if it was intended at the time it was paid

23

out to either be a dividend or return of capital or a

24

capital gain -

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Either one.

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MS. MAYNARD:

-- that would be enough to

2

satisfy the -- with respect to stock -

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It could be anything at

4

all.

So in other words, there is no preliminary

5

requirement that you intend that it be a return of

6

capital.

7

here, it was wrong.

Right.

8
9

So if the Court of Appeals said that

MS. MAYNARD:

I think if the court chooses

to read their test that rigidly, I don't believe that

10

the Petitioner understood it that way.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well I -- let me -- I just

12

want to get clear on how you understand it.

13

one alternative in which you defend the Ninth Circuit.

14

Justice Scalia has given you another alternative in

15

which you don't defend the Ninth Circuit.

16

which are you going to take?

17

MS. MAYNARD:

I gave you

Which -

I must not understand.

There

18

are three elements.

19

additional element, Your Honor, to the defense than the

20

two you laid out.

21

I want to make clear there is an

That there would also -- the taxpayer must

22

have a sufficient basis in his stock to cover the amount

23

of the diverted funds for it to be treated as a return

24

of capital.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can I try a third example?

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Because I think an example might help.

2

9

There is no

There is no problem about the

Let us imagine they put in the corporate
records on June 1:

This is a very valuable corporation;

10

we are going to make a fortune; and this is a dividend.

11

They write it down.

12

Now, unfortunately, four weeks later the

13

bottom falls out of the market, and it is not a dividend

14

for the reason that they have no profits that year.

15

Now, is it not under ordinary tax law a return of

16

capital?

17

MS. MAYNARD:

Yes, Your Honor.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MS. MAYNARD:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

If If that -- once you say

21

yes, then the Ninth Circuit must be wrong because the

22

Ninth Circuit said we do not look to see what happens.

23

MS. MAYNARD:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

If that's how A month later, we look just

to see how it's characterized by the corporation at the

said.

6

MS. MAYNARD:

-- perhaps that would be

right.

8

can see that the Ninth Circuit is talking about whether

9

or not it was a constructive distribution.

10

But I believe if one looks back to Miller, you

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but why talk about

11

that at all?

12

simplest example, he is basically saying let Section 301

13

make the determination, in effect, at the end of the

14

year, when we know what the actual situation of the

15

corporation is.

it, and you don't have to get into the -- sort of the

metaphysics of intent.

I mean, on Justice Breyer's third and

Yes.

MS. MAYNARD:

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Right.

And there -

And I think he was assuming

24

and I'm assuming that -- that that condition is met.

25

But, in order to meet that condition, you don't have to
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have a specific intent that the -- on the part of the

2

corporation that the distribution either be a return of

3

capital or that the distribution either be a dividend.

4

It simply has to be a distribution to this guy because

5

he is a stockholder.

6
7

MS. MAYNARD:

That's right, Your Honor.

We

agree with that.

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

MS. MAYNARD:

Okay.

If he had testified here that

10

he believed he was receiving a dividend at the time he

11

took these funds, we believe that would be sufficient to

12

meet the threshold requirement.

13
14
15

JUSTICE SCALIA:
that.

He wants a chance to argue

He was not given a chance to argue that.
MS. MAYNARD:

I believe you can tell from

16

his proffer, Your Honor, that he understood his test was

17

to show that these were intended to be some sort of

18

constructive distributions.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Was there anything in the

20

tax court at all that used the words as having any

21

significance for this determination whether there was a

23

any -- any hint that those -- those words were

controlling?

This is a criminal case.

A criminal case, yes.
Okay.

In the trial court

MS. MAYNARD:

In -- in -- the rule has been

clear in the Ninth Circuit since 1976 that you had to

10

make a showing that there was an intent at the time the

11

moneys were paid to make a constructive distribution.

12

So, no, there was no need to go back to

13

first principles and argue where in the statute that

14

rule was grounded; but the Government has made this

15

argument and made it in seeking an en banc prehearing in

16

D'Agostino, in 1998.

17

This is not a new argument.

When -- when

21

an elementary, stupid question?

evasion or -

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The

But in a criminal case, in

So your theory, just to be

7

sure I understand, it was not salary; it was not a

8

dividend; it was the proceeds of an embezzlement?

9

MS. MAYNARD:

That was as we argued it to

10

the jury, Your Honor.

11

the Government to characterize in a tax -- for the

12

purposes of a criminal case, this Court's decision in

13

Holland makes clear that in order to prove the tax

14

deficiency element of a tax evasion case, or here a

15

false statement with respect to income for the false

16

return counts, the Government need prove only two

17

things:

18

But there is no need in --

for

One, that the Defendant received a

19

substantial amount of funds that he did not report on

20

his income taxes.

go after the corporation, you are specifically going to

was income to the corporation.

situation you're in here.

was not taxable income.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MS. MAYNARD:

It was not taxable income.

Yes, it should have been.

6

Yes, Your Honor, it should have been taxable income to

the corporation, income that was coming to the

corporation that he diverted before it hit the corporate

9

-- just before it hit the corporation's books.

In other

10

instances, he took money from the corporation and put it

11

to his personal use.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Under your response to

13

Justice Stevens, once you show that it was from a likely

14

source of income that he received it, it's unreported,

15

then it's the defendant's burden to go ahead and show

16

this was a 301 distribution, that I had a basis that

17

absorbed it, that there were no earnings and profits.

That's all for the defendant.

And here he proffered nothing to show that this was a

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

He said in his

proffer that he would present expert testimony that this

therefore it was a return of capital.

"Alternatively,

on whether or not HIE" -- the corporation -- "had

4

5

testify that it could have been either dividends,

Justice Breyer, or a return of capital.

they were in fact treated as return of capital.

That's right, Your Honor, and

18

our position is that in both civil and criminal cases

21

under all the facts and circumstances it in fact be a

distribution, either a dividend or return of capital.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I think maybe he was simply

2

getting at the fact that under 301, assuming the

3

possibilities of non-301 treatment are excluded, under

4

301 it will be treated either as a dividend or as a

5

return of capital, depending on the corporate books for

6

that year, and he wasn't making a proffer at that point

7

precisely as to what those corporate books would show,

8

but he was making a proffer that, under 301, it would

either be classified as a dividend or as a return of

capital.

12

And wasn't that enough to -- to get him -- get

MS. MAYNARD:

No, Your Honor.

In our view,

13

301(a), the language with respect to stock, and the

14

history makes clear that it was added to the 1954 Code

Well, but if he is

22

making a profit and it depends upon whether or not

23

there's adequate earnings or not, isn't he plainly

saying that that means it's with respect to my stock?

25

Because if he were getting it, for example, as an

2

there was sufficient earnings or not.

3

it depends on whether there's sufficient earnings, it

seems to me that that's clearly notifying you that he's

saying it's with respect to his stock.

6

MS. MAYNARD:

But when he says

This proffer also has factual

7

proffers in it, Your Honor, and none of the factual

The Petitioner testified JUSTICE SCALIA:

He said -- and it seems to

11

me that this is enough to put you on notice -- "Boulware

12

will present further evidence that all of the alleged

10

reason he proffered an expert is because he doesn't

believe there is this first element of the defense, at

12

bottom, that the Government believes that there is, and

13

that in 301(a) the threshold requirement, with respect

mode, and the Government asserts a deficiency.

it have to say what the elements of the deficiency are?

2

And what would it say in this case?

3

MS. MAYNARD:

Well, in this case the

4

Government's position at bottom is that he stole these

5

funds, but that -- but in the criminal case it didn't

6

need to characterize it.

7

I think -- and if I can take a common

8

criminal -- a common civil situation, Your Honor, where

9

a corporation comes in and tries to deduct a salary that

10

it pays to a controlling shareholder and/or to, say, the

11

spouse of the controlling shareholder who is also a

12

shareholder, and the services that that person has

13

provided, the corporation has called it a salary and

14

deducted it as necessary business expenses, and the

15

Service comes in and says that's -- we're going to

16

disallow that deduction and then that's litigated in Tax

17

Court.

18

In that situation, the Government does often

19

argue that that -- the excess -- you know, say this

20

person at home is providing $10,000 in bookkeeping

services to the corporation, when in fact a net value, a

net worth, fair market value of $10,000 of services, but

being paid $500,000, and the corporation is deducting it

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. CLINE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7
8

MR. CLINE:

Your Honor, I just want to make

a few quick points.
The phrase "with respect to stock" was never

10

discussed in the district court at all.

It was never

11

discussed before the court of appeals panel at all.

12

was never the basis in the lower courts for the

13

Government's position that Mr. Boulware could not assert

14

a return of capital defense.

It

15

The Government's sole argument, from the

16

time it moved to exclude Mr. Boulware's testimony on

17

this issue and his evidence on this issue to the time

18

that it sought to prevent him from getting a jury

19

instruction on this issue, the Government's only

20

argument was Miller, and in particular the Miller

21

requirement that there be an intent, a contemporaneous

22

intent that the distribution be a return of capital.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

Do you think Even so, no harm no foul,

if, in fact, you hadn't proffered any evidence that
50

would enable you to meet the -- in respect to stock

2

requirement.

3

that you hadn't proffered anything?

4

Now, what do you say to the contention

MR. CLINE:

I say several things, Justice

5

Scalia.

First of all, I think there was an adequate

6

proffer at page 97 of the joint appendix.

7

Second, at pages 62 through 66 of the joint

8

appendix, Mr. Boulware specifically invokes Truesdell

9

and the -- and the D'Agostino no earnings, no profits -

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, at 97, are you

11

saying that the expert would have brought with him

12

financial records to show earnings and profits and

13

basis?

14

there was nothing for him to testify to because there

15

was no other -- the basic value was not in the record.

Because I interpret the Government as saying

16

MR. CLINE:

Justice Kennedy, there actually

17

is a fair amount of basis data in the record.

18

quickly refer the Court to the portions of the joint

19

appendix.

20

Mr. Boulware contributed a water company value of

21

roughly $1.7 million dollars to HIE.

22

appendix 70 through 73, 116 through 23, 147 through 51.

23

And I can

There is testimony, for example, that

That's at joint

There's evidence that he contributed a

24

coffee processing and wholesaling business valued at

But those are different.

5

Those are whether that's a corporate purpose.

I think

6

the question here is, as I started, I thought that this

7

expert was going to testify that there were no earnings

8

and profits in the relevant year.

9

closely, it seems to me that that is not what the expert

Having read it more

is going to testify.

12

capital if the basis is high enough.

13

testify to that legal proposition.

14

Rather, he's going to say if there

He's going to

So, my question is, is there any proffer of

15

evidence here where the taxpayer says I want a chance to

16

show there were no earnings or profits?

17

MR. CLINE:

Justice Breyer -

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. CLINE:

Where is it?

That's how I read the portion of

20

the joint appendix at pages 62 through 66 that I

21

referred to where Mr. Boulware invokes that rule.

22

Now, the problem here was that at no

23

point -- from the very beginning, the Government brought

24

this issue to fore by filing a motion in limine.

25

the sole focus of the Government's motion in limine was
52
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

the Miller contemporaneous intent rule, and that was the

2

sole focus of the discussion.

about in the district court.

And so, Justice Breyer, the proffer is not

5

as wholesome as I might hope, but it's clear that

6

Mr. Boulware sought the opportunity to present earnings

7

and profits and basic information through expert

8

testimony.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you recognize that he

10

would have the burden?

11

no earnings and profits so what I got was a return of

12

capital, it would be his burden to show that?

MR. CLINE:

If he said this corporation had

I think, Justice Ginsburg, that

14

under the rule in Bok and under the rule that the

15

parties proceeded under in the district court in this

16

case, whether or not it's the correct rule, Mr. Boulware

17

had the burden of producing some evidence, some evidence

18

of the earnings and profits and the basis issues.

into the record more or less by happenstance because the

15

district court had prohibited any evidence of return of

capital.

MR. CLINE:

No.

It came in throughout the

trial.

And that evidence

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, this is a

motion in limine which is before the trial.

23

MR. CLINE:

No.

The motion was actually

24

filed June 30th, which is, I think, the third day of

25

trial.

The issue was litigated continuously throughout

the trial up until, I think, July 11th, which was a day

2

or two before it ended.

3

throughout the trial.

4

This issue came up repeatedly

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what did happen there?

5

I've been looking at page 62 through 66.

6

dancing around the issue.

7

wouldn't be having these four pages unless they are

8

thinking of return of capital as a defense, but they

9

don't actually say it.

10

MR. CLINE:

11

They are

It's fair to say that they

Justice Breyer, had the issue

not been limited to the Miller -

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

MR. CLINE:

They would have raised it.

I believe that Mr. Boulware

14

would have presented expert testimony that would, in

15

fact, have at least put into play the issue of earnings

16

and profits and basis.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well am I -- am I right

18

that all he would have to do in order to satisfy that

19

burden would be this:

20

gather he availed himself of, to show that, in fact, the

21

-- the funds were loans or non-income to him.

22

He would have the option, which I

And he would also have had the option to

23

follow that by putting on the corporate accountant

24

saying:

25

corporate books show.

This guy is a stockholder.

It's what the

No. 2, the corporation didn't have any

2

profits that year.

3

the money was corporate funds, the only thing left under

4

301 is to treat it as a return of capital.

5

fact, the funds exceeded his basis, to treat it as a

6

capital gain.

7

No. 3, if the money was diverted, if

And if, in

So all he had to do, in effect, to make the

8

proffer, as I understand it, is to say:

If you don't

9

believe me that this was non-income like a loan, then

10

all I have to do is to put in the evidence that the

11

corporation didn't have any -- any profits that year,

12

and Section 301 will take care of the rest of it.

13

Because you have to conclude that it's either a return

14

of capital or a capital gain.

15

Is that fair?

16

MR. CLINE:

17

Is that correct?

I think that's basically right,

Justice Souter, and -

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, wait.

Doesn't he

19

have to show, still show, that it's with respect to

20

stock?

21

MR. CLINE:

Yes, but -

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That one little element:

23

That he has to show the distribution was not because

24

this was his girlfriend, but it was with respect to

25

stock, and the record is -- is that the intent?

JUSTICE SOUTER:

he is a stockholder?

5

MR. CLINE:

I think so, Justice Souter, and

I think -

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I mean I agree with Justice

7

Scalia, but doesn't he make it at least to the point of

8

putting the Government to its proof by showing that he

9

is a stockholder?

10

MR. CLINE:

That he is a stockholder, and

11

that he did not receive this money in any nonstockholder

20

hard to say it's with respect to stock when the other

21

stockholder doesn't get any.

22

MR. CLINE:

Chief Justice Roberts, the

23

cases, again, are uniform -- and we cite them, I think,

24

at footnote 8 of our reply brief -- that you can have a

25

constructive distribution even if there are no corporate
57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

formalities, even if it's a disproportionate

2

distribution, even if other stockholders don't share it.

3

And, again, that's a position that the Government

4

argues.

5
6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What page in your

brief did you say?

7

MR. CLINE:

I believe it is -- the cases are

8

cited, I believe, at footnote 8 of our reply brief.

9

me just make sure.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. CLINE:

Of your reply brief?

It's footnote 3 --

I'm sorry.

12

It's footnote 3 on page 8, and there is a whole series

13

of cases.

14

Justice, there is no law to the contrary, and this is a

15

position that the Government, itself, argues.

16

And, again, as far as I know, Mr. Chief

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The issue is whether the

17

Government wants to convict more -- more malfeasors or

18

whether it wants to collect more money, and the latter

19

obviously prevails in the cases, right?

20

MR. CLINE:

But, Justice Scalia, it seems to

21

prevail only in this case, and I would be astonished if

22

counsel argues that the Government views Mr. Boulware as

23

having stolen this money from the corporation.

24

be astonished if the Government would accept a theft

25

deduction, if HIE argued for it, when the Government
