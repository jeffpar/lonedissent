ORAL ARGUMENT OF JERRY V. BEARD

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. BEARD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

Section 1956, the money laundering statute,

11

requires an intent to minimize the criminal taint of

12

unlawful proceeds.

13

concealing money's existence.

14

Mr. Cuellar's conviction should be reversed for two

15

reasons.

16

involved may have been designed to conceal, the

17

transportation itself was not.

18

may have in fact concealed money itself, he did not

19

conceal the nature, source, location, ownership or

20

control of the unlawful proceeds.

21

But the statute does not criminalize
In this case,

First, while the method of the transportation

Secondly, while Cuellar

Well, he certainly

of the money was certainly concealed.

25

MR. BEARD:

They were secreted in the car,
The location

sense location was concealed.

The point to be taken

2

here I think is this:

3

4

numbers among them.

5

requirement that there be a design to conceal or to

6

disguise these particular attributes, necessarily means

7

a plan, if you will, for those -- excuse me -- for those

8

attributes to be presented either to law enforcement if

they intercept the money or inject it into legitimate

Location has independent meaning, but it's also

JUSTICE BREYER:

Maybe I should ask you this

17

now because you've probably thought about it and I can't

18

work it out.

I don't see any problem with the word

19

"location."

I thought what you would say is it isn't

20

the transportation in this instance that concealed the

21

location, it's the method of transportation that sealed

22

the location.

23

MR. BEARD:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Yes, Justice And if you read it that

literally, then there is no problem in getting to your
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

interpretation of the statute, or is there?

2

since you didn't advance that argument, I thought maybe

3

there's something I've not seen here.

4

MR. BEARD:

Because

No, Justice Breyer; you're

5

correct.

There is a huge difference between the method

6

of transportation and the transportation itself.

7

this particular case, the difference is certainly

8

implicated.

9

arguing is that the method of the transportation

And in

What we understand the government to be

10

signifies the listed attributes.

11

case it would effectively render all transportation of

12

funds necessarily to be money laundering.

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But if that were the

May I just ask, what do

14

you mean by method of transportation in this case?

15

mean, that it was in a car or the fact it was wrapped up

16

in dirty --

17

and so on?

18

I

in a dirty kind of container, and so forth

MR. BEARD:

Justice Stevens, what I'm

19

referring to is certainly that it was in a car, but

20

there was a secret compartment, goat hair was sprinkled

21

around to try to throw off drug detection dogs, and

22

those type of characteristics.

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But isn't that all just

24

evidence that there was a motive to conceal the

25

ownership?
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. BEARD:

No, I don't think so,

2

Justice Stevens.

What we're looking at here is that the

3

design of the -- the fact Mr. Cuellar may or may not

4

have known, for example, who owned -- where the money

5

was coming from or who owned it, that doesn't go to the

6

design of the transportation.

7

transportation itself is just to get the money to

8

Mexico.

9

particular because we know from the government's

The design of the

10

12

13

purpose of this transportation was to get this money

14

back as repayment money.

15

We know that this was

So in this particular case at least, the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If he were a courier

16

bringing the marijuana into the United States what would

17

be the crime and the penalty?

18

MR. BEARD:

Justice, if he was bringing -

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If he was bringing

20

marijuana into the United States instead of returning

21

with the proceeds?

22

MR. BEARD:

Well, presumably, Your Honor, it

23

would be a drug trafficking crime.

24

understand your hypothetical, he would possess marijuana

25

at that time.
6
Alderson Reporting Company

But of course, as I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But now he possesses

2

money.

And you're not saying this is innocent behavior.

3

It is criminal behavior, so what is the crime if not

4

money laundering?

5

MR. BEARD:

We have suggested that

6

Mr. Cuellar's, liability, liability or culpability, lie

7

more properly under the bulk cash smuggling statute.

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that requires knowing

that it's illegal to take out more than X amount of

10

money, and there's nothing that indicates that the

11

common courier would know anything about such a

12

provision.

13

MR. BEARD:

Yes, you're correct that it

14

would require inference as opposed to direct evidence.

15

This is why in our reply brief, we gave an example of

16

where the identical type behavior arose, not in Texas

17

but in Alabama, and in fact the individual pleaded

18

guilty to bulk cash smuggling.

19

So I suppose my response would be this.

The

20

same weak inferences that supported the money laundering

21

conviction in the government's eyes would be the same

22

inferences that would support the cash smuggling.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If we take it that you

24

concede -- I don't want to say that you concede.

25

take it the government has a strong case under the
7
Alderson Reporting Company

If we

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

smuggling statute, wouldn't it have an equally strong

2

case under (i) of the statute that we're considering

3

here, which doesn't require concealing or disguising the

4

nature, just to avoid a transportation reporting

5

requirement.

That's the same as the smuggling statute.

6

MR. BEARD:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8
9

No, I don't think I know the government

didn't indict under (ii).
MR. BEARD:

But I don't think it is the

10

same, Your Honor, because the cash smuggling, the bulk

11

cash smuggling statute, speaks to currency and of course

12

this speaks to transactions.

13

is in fact -

14
15
16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So I think that there

You mean as the proceeds

of an illegal transaction?
MR. BEARD:

Well, I'm distinguishing between

17

currency and transaction because as I understand it at

18

least transaction might implicate in a banking context,

19

but cash is cash, if you will.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So And it doesn't matter for

21

purposes of the bulk cash statute that it was illegal.

22

It could be perfectly lawful money.

23

MR. BEARD:

24

That's certainly true.

25

Yes, Your Honor, absolutely.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
8
Alderson Reporting Company

But why -- why isn't

Official - Subject to Final Review

this transporting to conceal the location or the

ownership in this sense?

10

Suppose you have someone the
They

They think it's there, and they're

Isn't that transportation to conceal the
location or the ownership?
MR. BEARD:

As I understand it, Mr. Chief

11

Justice, if the police are aware of it and then the

12

flush, if you will, takes the money across, I think

13

that's -- that's much closer.

14

That's -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, they think

15

it's there, but they're not sure, and they -- you know,

16

that would help them make their case, to find out that

17

the guy they think sold the drugs has $80,000.

18

get a search warrant or whatever, and it turns out he

19

doesn't, because it's been transported to conceal the

20

location or ownership.

21

MR. BEARD:

So they

I would -- no, I think that

22

the -- if the police were aware, if the police were

23

aware and the kingpin were aware and put in place some

24

type of design, if you will, to flush the money and

25

perhaps to -- to Mexico under the circumstances you
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

described, then you would be closer to, to having money

2

laundering liability, although certainly I don't know

3

that the courier necessarily would.

4

However, I think it's very important to

5

consider that the money laundering statute necessarily

6

contemplates this notion of -- of detection or the money

7

resurfacing, if you will.

8

important is because it gives a particular meaning to

9

those listed attributes.

And the reason I think that's

If the police were just -

10

well, in this case, just stumbled upon it, and nothing

11

was -- had been done and there was no evidence on the

12

record to suggest that there was going to be anything

13

done in this case other than repayment, money laundering

14

liability is simply not going to arise.

15

Now, I think that -

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

I still don't see why isn't

17

what the Chief Justice said absolutely right?

If you

18

are transporting this money to get it out of town so the

19

police can't find it, you're transporting it to conceal

20

it.

That falls right within the statute.

21

MR. BEARD:

I -

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

If you're transporting it

23

simply to pay some courier somewhere else, you're not

24

transporting it to conceal it.

25

transportation is done in a way that conceals it, that's

And if in fact the

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

beside the point because the statute is interested in

2

transporting it in order to conceal it.

3

MR. BEARD:

I think that -

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

MR. BEARD:

What is wrong with that?

I think what's wrong, Your

6

Honor, is that the -- the statute focuses on the

7

transportation or some of the other transfers of

8

transmission and specifically is coupled, if you will,

9

with this notion of -- of the attributes themselves.

I

10

don't know that it's -- it's simply too broad, in fact,

11

to say that all transportation's will necessarily incur

12

the money laundering liability.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

understand the --

15

maybe -

I thought he was helping you, but

16

(Laughter.)

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

I -- maybe I don't

Were you helping him?

I

thought so.

19

(Laughter.)

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It sounds like he was

21

making the distinction that didn't the dissenting judge

22

make between -- the dissenting judge says transporting

23

to conceal is no good, but concealing to transport is

24

okay.

25

MR. BEARD:

That -- you're correct, Your
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Honor, and that is, I think, a point to be made.

The -

2

Judge Smith below did try to highlight the fact that if

3

you transport to conceal, then you're beginning to

4

implicate money laundering liability.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose someone transports

6

money across a border and is recorded surreptitiously on

7

tape explaining exactly why the person did it, and the

8

person says:

9

across the border is because I know that when I get it

The reason why I'm transporting this

10

to the destination country, that's a place where people

11

use huge amounts of cash for bank deposits, for

12

purchases; and, therefore the act of transporting it

13

from the United States to the other country will

14

disguise the nature of the cash as drug money.

15

Would that fall within the statute?

16

MR. BEARD:

No, I don't think so,

17

Justice Alito, and the reason I don't is because that

18

-- what you've described implicates potential money

19

spending, this notion that the money is easier spent.

20

But without more, money spending would not equate to

21

money laundering.

22

That's -

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why wouldn't that fit the

23

literal language of the statute?

It's a transportation

24

across the board with the design to conceal the nature,

25

i.e., that it's drug money, of this money?
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. BEARD:

I'm not sure, Justice, that

2

you've actually concealed the nature.

3

going -- if the money was dirty and going across dirty,

4

it remained dirty and just happened to be spent.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If the money was

But -

Yes, but it doesn't remain

6

dirty simply because it goes to a place in which the

7

appearance of this kind of cash does not have the dirty

8

appearance that it does at home.

9

that the correct answer?

10

MR. BEARD:

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

12

Why -- why isn't

I Why doesn't that make it

laundering?

13

MR. BEARD:

Again, I don't know that there

14

has been -- as I understood the hypothetical, I don't

15

think that there's been any suggestion of a design to

16

conceal, the why.

17

--

18

You're just taking dirty and you're

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but the design to

19

conceal -- maybe I misunderstood the hypo, but I thought

20

the design to conceal was you conceal the dirty

21

character of the money by taking it to a place and using

22

it in that place where use of large amounts of cash,

23

whether for bank deposits or spending in luxury stores,

24

does not have the dirty implication, the dirty

25

appearance that it does in the United States.
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

So, why doesn't that therefore satisfy the
concealment?

3

MR. BEARD:

I -- Justice Souter, I think

4

that the answer to the question is here.

5

designed to take -- or purposed to take these dirty

6

proceeds, unlawful proceeds, and to cleanse them so as

7

to prevent their injection into streams of legitimate

8

commerce.

9

The statute is

What you've described as spending is

10

admittedly spending, but I don't think that the spending

11

that's -- that you've contemplated there basically

12

implicates the core concern, if you will.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The money -

You don't have any evidence

14

like that here anyway, do we?

15

going to "Spendy Land" where everybody has a lot of

16

money?

17

Do we know that this was

Did we know that?
MR. BEARD:

Justice Scalia, what we know,

18

because the government's evidence established it, is

19

that the money was being sent back to Mexico to repay

23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:
of money in Mexico?

Does everybody have a lot

Is that -

MR. BEARD:

Well, I would hazard to say no,

of course, but the record JUSTICE ALITO:

Was there -- was there
14

Alderson Reporting Company

evidence about the nature of the Mexican economy?

2
3

MR. BEARD:

There was.

There was, Your

Honor.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

5

MR. BEARD:

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

7

MR. BEARD:

What was the evidence?

I'm sorry?
What was the evidence?

The evidence that you just asked

8

about went to that it was easier to spend money in

9

Mexico.

10
11

JUSTICE ALITO:

said that Mexico has a cash economy?

12

MR. BEARD:

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

14

MR. BEARD:

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

16
17

Wasn't there an expert who

Yes, yes.

And it -- and -

And what does that mean?

What I take it to mean Does it mean people can

spend a lot of cash without raising eyebrows?
MR. BEARD:

Certainly more than here.

That

18

was what I think that the evidence was offered for.

19

the same expert, of course offered, you know,

20

established -- or the government established through the

21

same expert that the purpose of this particular

22

transportation was to complete the transaction, the drug

23

transaction.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

And

In your brief, you argue

that there has to be a design to create the appearance
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of legitimate wealth.

2

that argument?

3

Are you drawing back now from

MR. BEARD:

No, and, of course, we are well

4

aware that those words are not found in the statute, nor

5

do we suggest that they were.

6

suggested is simply that that's, if you will, shorthand

7

for describing what necessarily occurs if the

8

attributes, the listed attributes, are obfuscated.

9

is the cleansing mechanism.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

But what we have

That

Well, why would that be so?

11

Suppose -- I mean, just take --

modify my hypothetical.

12

What this person says on the tape is:

13

money across the border because I know that if it -

14

once it gets there, it will be harder to establish my

15

ownership of it.

16

money perhaps, but they -- it will be harder to

17

establish my ownership of it.

I'm sending this

People will still know that it's drug

18

Now, would that fall within the statute?

19

MR. BEARD:

20
21

Well, at that point, yes,

because I think JUSTICE ALITO:

But there wouldn't be an

22

attempt to create the appearance of legitimate wealth

23

there then, would there?

24
25

MR. BEARD:

Well, to the extent that the

individual who has been taped is contemplating the

1

money's resurfacing, I think that there would be.

2

would be not legitimate wealth, though.

3

need to drive this point home.

4

In other words, there's not a requirement that the dirty

5

money necessarily be made clean or a description, but

6

that the dirty money be made less dirty.

7

think is -- is what we're talking about.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It

And perhaps I

It would be less dirty.

And that I

Does the statutory purpose

have to be the only purpose or the principal purpose?

10

mean, I could conceive that the principal purpose of

11

this transportation was to give the money back to the

12

fellow who gave the drugs, to pay the provider of the

13

drugs.

14

I assume that would be the principal purpose.
But what if you know that when the -- when

15

the provider of the drugs is paid, he'll be able to

16

spend this cash easily in Mexico, which has a cash

17

economy?

18

satisfy the purpose requirement of this statute.

19

-- what would be the result?

20
21
22
23
24
25

And let's assume that the latter is enough to

MR. BEARD:

What

If we -- well, Justice Scalia,

if we JUSTICE SCALIA:

If you assume a primary

purpose to pay off the MR. BEARD:

Right.

If we assume that the -

that the latter, as you just said, satisfies the
17
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

statute, then you have a conviction.

2

But we certainly don't assume that, because

3

that implicates money spending, and money spending

4

hasn't -- hasn't been held to be money laundering.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Even though that wasn't the

6

real purpose -- I mean, the real purpose was to pay off

7

this fellow, who otherwise might come to hurt you.

8

MR. BEARD:

Yes, absolutely.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But once you do pay him

10

off, you know that the money is going to be ready

11

spendable.

12

MR. BEARD:

Well, certainly in this case, we

13

don't have any evidence that Mr. Cuellar knew any such

14

thing.

15

the Cuellar case, I think you -- your hypothetical does

16

come closer to implicating liability; but that's simply

17

not what we have here, at least.

18

If you were to remove it from the confines of

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Now, what you understand

19

the language "disguise the nature of the proceeds of

20

this specified unlawful activity" to mean, does that -

21

is that satisfied by merely proof that it is proceeds of

22

unlawful activity?

23

is the word "nature" talking about?

24
25

Or do you have to tell that -- what

MR. BEARD:

No, Justice Stevens.

again, I think, require more.

It would

If all that were required

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is to show that there was unlawful proceeds -

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

3

to say.

4

means?

5

What I'm asking is:

MR. BEARD:

Well, that's what it seems
What do you think it

Well, what I think it means is

6

that there has to be some -- the transportation or what

7

have you has to be purposed, designed, to take the

8

nature and obfuscate it.

9

And this -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But I'm just asking about

10

the word -- the meaning of the word "nature."

11

the nature, other than the fact it's proceeds of

12

unlawful activity?

13

MR. BEARD:

What is

itself means the carrying of something from one place to

another.

suggests that one should look at the entire plan, the

way that this transportation was conceived or planned

out in the mind, which would include, we would submit,

23

the method that was -- that was chosen to be used for

But it is not limited, as Petitioner would

suggest, to just one fact, that being what's going to

5

happen to the funds after the transportation is over.

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

literally for what it says?
MS. SCHERTLER:

Your Honor, several

responses to that, to that question.
First of all, what's the purpose -- if we

5

want to look beyond the words "designed in whole or in

6

part" in the context of the international money

7

laundering statute to try to discern what the purpose

8

was of the statute, the purpose of this statute was to

9

prevent criminals from taking their proceeds abroad

10

where they would be outside the reach of all of these

11

controls that have been set up in the United States in

12

order to detect illegal proceeds and use those proceeds

13

to trace back to the crimes and the criminals that

14

generated them.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But if that's all they were

16

getting at, they wouldn't have to have this

17

international component at all, because if you totally

18

eliminated the "to or through" requirement and you were

19

able to focus or properly focus solely on the method of

20

the transportation, et cetera, then you would cover not

21

only cases in which the concealment ultimately would

22

take place by crossing a border, but you would pick up

23

cases in which the concealment would take place even

24

within the United States; and that would certainly be in

25

the government's interest.
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

But if you add, if you say, well, but this

2

is limited by a to or through requirement, then it

3

suggests, it seems to me, as Justice Breyer's question

4

does, that it must -- the statute must be getting at

5

what happens when it crosses the border as opposed to

6

the means of crossing.

7

What's your answer to that?

8

MS. SCHERTLER:

9

My answer to that, Your

Honor, is that that would have -- that would defeat the

10

purpose for which this statute was enacted.

11

premise of this statute was that once illegal proceeds

12

are taken abroad, taken outside of the United States

system, we lose control of them, we lose the ability to

14

find them, and we will have no idea -

government's theory anyone who transports hidden money

15

to get it out of the country, who drives the car, just

16

the driver, is a money launderer.

17

MS. SCHERTLER:

One can think of the

Justice Ginsburg, the -

18

Congress's purpose here was in getting at exactly this

19

kind of conduct by third parties in particular, because

20

when you use a third party that violates another purpose

21

at which the statute is directed:

22

to conceal who the true owner in control of the proceeds

23

is.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

using third parties

MS. SCHERTLER:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Because if I'm -- if I'm in

the drug business and my -- my brother is an

5

international social worker or something, I'm certainly

6

going to conceal when I give it to him and he carries it

7

across the border.

8
9

MS. SCHERTLER:

Yes, Justice Souter, that

would be another example of using a third party so that

10

a -- so that one part of the design of that

11

transportation is to conceal the ownership and control

12

of the proceeds.

13

And in response to Justice Ginsburg's

14

question, Congress also -- well, in the sentencing

15

guidelines system now, the guidelines takes account of

16

whether you have the individual who is also engaged in

17

the underlying offense or whether you have a third party

18

who had not been involved in the underlying offense.

19

But no -- no matter how you see it, this was

20

precisely the conduct that Congress is getting at.

21

saw that the only way to -- to get at crime -- one way

22

that was very important to it was to get at the money

23

and in order to get at the money you need to be able to

counteract the ways in which the criminals would prevent

presented with testimony that that was the design -

that the only design, the only purpose, the only plan in

using that suitcase was to use it to secure money for

travel, then we would not have met our burden, but based

solely on the circumstances.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, your answer to

11

Justice Scalia's hypothetical is still not clear to me.

12

It -- it seems to me your answer should be yes, because

13

he's concealing the ownership as of the time he goes

14

across the border, which brings me to my earlier

15

question, if once it's concealed, the statute is always

MR. BEARD:

Happily I've been thinking about

it.

Disruption versus detection I had told you, told

4

the Court that this was not a detection statute as much

5

as it is a disruption statute.

6

I think it is important for the Court to

7

recall that the very broad interpretations that the

8

government advances today are essentially the very broad

9

interpretations that the Congress rejected explicitly 20

10

years ago.

The Congress rejected the notion that the

11

transportation of illicit funds in and of itself created

12

money laundering liability.

And we've discussed that.

13

I think it's important, Justice Scalia, in

14

particular, in response to your question to bring this

15

up, because the Congress recognized that detection would

I think the true harm in the government's

money laundering with the underlying offense, because

all of the underlying offenses involve concealment.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So then your question

that question?

15

MR. BEARD:

We have spoken in the question

presented in that broad term, because we think that that

language encapsulates what's taking place.

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It is not an essential

element of the offense?

20

MR. BEARD:

It's not an element.

But what

21

is an essential element is the need for the

22

transportation -- the transportation to be designed to

23

accomplish the same thing, to obfuscate those

24

attributes.

reason why -

The Congress had identified,

6

Justice Alito, those particular attributes as being key

7

to allowing the launderer to inject the money back into

It may be that nature is implicated more

marijuana, and that was very puzzling to me.

is the standard operating procedure to take this money

Justice, I know that the -
