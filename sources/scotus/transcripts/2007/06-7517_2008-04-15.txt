Mr. Madden.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR J. MADDEN, III

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8
9

MR. MADDEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This is a sentencing process case.

10

The

11

first step of the sentencing process described by the

12

Court in Rita, as noticed, broke down in this case.

13

Petitioner first learned that the district court

14

contemplated a non-Guideline sentence when it was

15

pronounced.

16

sentence were not noticed and the issues were,

17

therefore, not litigated.

18

The

The grounds for that statutory maximum

The government here agrees that the lack of

19

notice was error and advocates notices for all sentences

20

outside the Guidelines.

21

Because it's only through notice can the sentencing

22

court subject a defendant's sentence to the thorough

23

adversarial testing contemplated by Federal sentencing

24

procedure.

25

This is the correct result.

That quote comes from Rita and relies upon
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

rules 32(f), (h), (i), and a decision of this Court in

2

United States versus Burns.

3

decision in this case.

That law controls the

4

The position of the Amicus --

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You may not have had

6

notice of the issue of whether or not an alternative

7

procedure and medication audit would help, but you

8

certainly knew that future dangerousness was going to be

9

on the table.

And if you had a response to that, which

10

is, well, if he took his medication, it wouldn't be a

11

problem, I assume you would have prepared for that.

12

MR. MADDEN:

The -- the -- the notice that

13

suggested -- the Guidelines departure which is suggested

14

in the last paragraph of the pre-sentence report, is

15

very specific.

16

departure.

17

different than the grounds on which the court departed.

18

So, no, that wasn't adequate notice.

19

It is directed toward the 4A1.3

The concerns raised by that are completely

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, yeah, I -- but

20

in terms of what issues might suggest themselves to a

21

judge sentencing this particularly defendant, I would

22

have thought future dangerousness.

23

individual who has leveled particular threats with some

24

degree of certainty that he intends to pursue them, I

25

would have thought that would have been one of the first
4
Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, you have an

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

things a sentencing judge would look at.
MR. MADDEN:

Well, it was looked at in the

3

context of the sixth level enhancement for intent to

4

carry out the threat, and it did come up in the context

5

of acceptance of responsibility.

6

different issues than the ground that the sentence was

7

ultimately -- the -- the upward non-Guideline sentence

8

was ultimately imposed on.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But both look at

Well, you know this -- this

10

provision 32(h), really doesn't -- does simply not work

11

with post-Booker guidelines.

12

was designed for a different regime, and therefore, has

13

no effect now after Booker, or else you have to expand

14

it beyond what it says, because may depart from the

15

applicable sentencing range on a ground not identified,

16

under the mandatory guidelines, they were identified

17

grounds for departure.

You either have to say it

18

And you had some -- the court could look at

19

those and say, gee, am I going to pick one of these, if

20

so I'll let him know.

21

the ground that you don't agree with the -- with what

22

the Guidelines say as -- is that what you would call a

23

ground of departure?

24
25

But you can depart now simply on

It's simply a ground of disagreement, I
would suppose.

Why shouldn't we hold 32(h) simply.
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Simply has no -- no application under the new system?

2

Or at least hold that all it applies to are departures

3

within the meaning of the old mandatory guidelines

4

system?

5

departures.

6

Which is a much narrower category of

MR. MADDEN:

Yes, sir.

I think first it

7

would seem to make -- it would not make sense to demand

8

notice for a finite range of factors, but no notice for

9

a potentially broader one.

10
11

counter-intuitive.

That seems

But --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't think it is

12

counter-intuitive to provide -- to -- to require notice

13

when the number of grounds is finite.

14

of grounds is infinite, I'm much less inclined to read

15

it as even applicable to the situation.

16

MR. MADDEN:

But if the number

But the -- the decision of --

17

in Burns, I think, answers the question because unless

18

there's -- if a party is not focused -- and generally

19

the parties' papers and the PSR will focus the issues.

20

But in the few cases where -- where an extraneous

21

sentencing consideration that's important enough to

22

drive the sentence up or down is raised, in order to

23

have adversarial testing of that important issue, there

24

has to be some kind of notice.

25

is not what we're calling a variance, a non-Guidelines

And it's not -- variance

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

sentence is not a pure exercise in policy even in

2

Kimbrough.

3

That was a policy disagreement but it was

4

driven by facts, and the defendant in that case, the

5

appellant, gave notice that they were going to be

6

challenging it, and -- and there was a factual

7

presentation.

8

make the policy determination.

9

So the record was in the right shape to

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Post-Booker the guidelines

10

are advisory, and the district judge has discretion as

11

to the sentence.

12

Now, in the bad old days, when the statute

13

said 20 to 40, and the judge decided to give you 40, he

14

didn't have to give you notice of why he was giving you

15

the highest sentence.

16

And now that we've returned to a system that

17

is closer to that, why should we interpret 32(h) as

18

imposing a very difficult to comply with requirement

19

that didn't exist under the -- under the pre-pre-Booker

20

system?

21

MR. MADDEN:

I remember that system.

22

I think the -- the answer is that -- that

23

it -- it's important -- the requirement is essential for

24

purposes of advocacy on the issues.

25

reflects the Court's understanding again of what
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Burns -- Burns

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Congress intended in the Sentencing Reform Act.

2

said Congress intended notice and litigation.

3

They

Now, this Court had to make some excisions

4

on Sixth Amendment grounds in what Congress -- what

5

Congress could do, but their intent hasn't changed.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose the district court

7

in this case had said I'm considering an

8

above-Guidelines sentence based on facts that are in the

9

record in the pre-sentence report to protect the public

10

from further crimes of the defendant.

11

Would that be adequate notice?

12

MR. MADDEN:

13

It's close.

No.

Not on the grounds here.

It's closer.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

MR. MADDEN:

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What would have been?

I think -- I think -And how much time -- this

17

is two questions; time question and the content

18

question.

19
20
21

What would she have had to say to comply
with the rule as you read it?
MR. MADDEN:

Yes, Your Honor.

Reading it

22

backward from what the comment -- the explanation of the

23

sentence at the end backwards to what the grounds were

24

and the notice should have been, her finding was that --

25

that he would continue to be a threat regardless of the
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

supervision we are under.

2

That was the key.

To say if there is nothing other than

3

maximum incapacitation which will prevent him from being

4

a danger in the future, if that was the issue, if the

5

question is:

6

extra incapacitation, then everyone could have

7

litigated, that would have been the issue that was on

8

the table.

9

Is there any lesser sentence than maximum

JUSTICE ALITO:

You seem to be requiring a

10

very specific kind of notice, almost as if the district

11

court has to say this is the sentence that I'm

12

considering, and these are the exact reasons that I'm

13

considering; now what do you have to say about that.

14

MR. MADDEN:

Yes.

15

with the Justice's second question.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

17

MR. MADDEN:

And I think that goes

Is that what you're asking?

-- content -- it needs to be

18

specific -- it needs to be specific enough so that the

19

facts that get litigated are the ones that are

20

ultimately recited by the court for the reason for the

21

non-Guidelines sentence.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

But why would the --

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's a complex answer.

24

And I -- this seems to me to be a clear case of what was

25

in the judge's mind.

She said I have a record here of
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

repeated e-mails to this woman, threatening to kill her,

2

threatening to kill her new husband, threatening to kill

3

her mother.

again.

7

9

He did it again and again and again.

It is my educated prediction that he will do it
So I'm going to put him away for as long as I

That's -- her reasoning process is not at
all mysterious.

10

What notice is the defendant lacking?

11

MR. MADDEN:

I think if -- if she would have

12

said something to the effect that -- and this sometimes

13

happens during the course of a sentencing, that's a

14

different issue -- but here's what's on my mind.

15

concerned that only extra prison time, incapacitation

16

for as long as I can give him, will do the job of

17

protecting society.

18

I'm

What do you have to say about that?

If that was the -- now isn't the written,

19

formal, this is during the context of the sentencing --

20

the way it comes out, then the response would be

21

something like, "Judge, there's -- there is psychiatric

22

evidence or psychological evidence that's developed that

23

I'd like to put on bearing on that issue in light of the

24

report from Buttner, the new report that just came into

25

the record right before the sentencing, that goes
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

directly to the issue of amenability to treatment; and

2

you're concerned that only maximum incapacitation will

3

address the issue.

4
5

I think that's how that -- that's how it
should have played out.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why -- why isn't that an

7

equally response to what Justice Ginsburg just gave as a

8

recitation of what the what the judge had said.

12

MR. MADDEN:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Anybody knows that what the

judge is getting at is I'm going to put him away as long

15

as I can put him away.

17

want to give, as your reformulation of the -- of the

That -- that discussion didn't occur -- the
notice didn't -JUSTICE SOUTER:

So it's not the question of

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

notice; it's the question of time to respond.

2

MR. MADDEN:

At that point it was

3

explanation, it explanation of what she was doing, not

4

notice of what she was going to do at a time when

5

it would have made a difference.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What is she supposed to do?

7

Usually there -- there's just one sentencing hearing,

8

right?

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

MR. MADDEN:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And there's --

Usually.
-- a pre-sentence report

12

which both parties have.

13

witnesses who come in.

14

the relatives of the deceased party come in; and -- and

15

usually the sentence is imposed at the end of that

16

proceeding.

17

And sometimes there are
Sometimes the injured parties or

Now when is -- when is the judge supposed to

18

be so precise as to what particular matters induce her

19

to -- to raise this sentence here?

20

MR. MADDEN:

I --

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Are you going to have a

22

recess?

23

week later so that the judge can decide in detail what

24

particular factors motivate her?

25

Or maybe reschedule the sentencing for -- for a

MR. MADDEN:

I think in -- in the vast
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

majority of cases, and the government concedes this in

2

the brief or acknowledges it, that while there are

3

infinite number of variables that lurk in every case,

4

practically, there are not that many that are actually

5

there.

6

report which you have way in advance or in advance.

7

There are -- the parties have a duty to

Those are usually identified in the pre-sentence

8

identify the issues that are going to be litigated; and

9

that's done.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

10
11

Now if it is in the

pre-sentence report, is that enough notice?

12

MR. MADDEN:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's typically -So long as it is in the

14

pre-sentence notice the judge doesn't have to say I plan

15

to rely on this aspect of the pre-sentence report?

16

MR. MADDEN:

No.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

MR. MADDEN:

Okay.

No, because in the vast

19

majority of cases that's what occurs.

And then the

20

parties have a duty to interject issues that they think

21

ought to drive the Guidelines or non-guidelines either

22

way.

23

And the bar is actually getting better at

24

that than when this occurred in picking up on 3553(a)

25

factors, and I think the problem is actually going to
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

become lesser over time.

2

So only in the extraordinary cases -- and

3

Burns was an extraordinary case -- where an issue that

4

is important to the judge isn't flagged in the papers --

5

does the duty arise to let -- let the parties know what

6

considerations they should focus their attention on, so

7

that they can be litigated.

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Does the defendant

9

have an obligation to give notice, both to the

10

government and I suppose to the judge, saying at the --

11

at the sentencing hearing, we're going to say this?

12

the judge can get ready for it?

13

get ready for it?

14
15

MR. MADDEN:

So

Or the government can

Usually, the interests, of

course, are different.

16

The -- the interests of the defendant in --

17

in a lower sentence, I think, is different than

18

defending against a higher -- a higher sentence; but

19

yes, I think it is appropriate.
And the rule says -- rule 32(h) only speaks

20
21

to the judge.

But I think the parties in their

22

positions are required by the local rule in the Southern

23

District of Alabama and the Federal rule generally to

24

put their -- their positions in writing in advance of

25

the hearing.

I think our rule, I believe, is seven
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

days.

2

So that when the judge, before getting ready

3

to sentence, looks at the issues, the people with the

4

heightened interest in them have already identified what

5

they are.

6

So the only -- it's only the residual issues

7

that are picked up by rule 32.

8

infrequently in practice.

9

It occurs very

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What about the point

10

made by Chief Judge Boudin in his recent opinion, is

11

that now that we look more carefully at the 3553

12

factors, counsel has to come in prepared to address all

13

of those?

14

MR. MADDEN:

It is -- you know, as a

15

practical matter, it is extremely wasteful.

16

17

to come out of that kind of system won't be on a

The rule

This Court doesn't have to decide this

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's not what it meant when

32(h) was promulgated.
MR. MADDEN:

10

Well, the Court in Rita, which

11

was after Booker, discussed in fact, the sentencing

12

court, applying the Guidelines in individual cases, may

13

depart either pursuant to the Guidelines or since Booker

14

by imposing a non-Guidelines sentence.

15

departure --

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The word

You could apply departure

17

to post-Booker; but at the time this rule was adopted,

18

departure did not consist of that; it consisted of

19

something much more narrow.

20

MR. MADDEN:

It -- it had a narrower meaning

21

but -- but the rule 32(h) was to implement the structure

22

of rule 32, that's what Burns said.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And --

Why should we put into

24

rule 32(h), as Justice Scalia suggests, the 3553(a)

25

factors, when we know that the rule makers did make a
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

change in 2007?

2

32(d)(2)(F); so they made a change there and they said

3

the judge could ask to have these things included in the

4

pre-sentence report; but they left (H) looking like it's

5

dealing just with the guidelines.

6

Court say well, we didn't put 3553 in (h), and so it's

7

not there?

8

That is they put 3553(a) into

MR. MADDEN:

Why couldn't the

Well, I don't think that that

9

answers the question, because under the prior structure

10

of the rule, the pre-sentencing was supposed to set out

11

all of the factors and (h) was just -- just a stopgap.

12

The provision that came in in December of

13

'07 that says that the court can request other factors,

14

I think is just that an authorization to the probation

15

officer to look at -- to look at other factors and to

16

think more broadly.

17

But I don't think that should be read as

18

limiting the scope of 32(h) simply to what would be

19

traditional guideline departures.
If I could, I'd reserve the balance of my

20
21

time.

MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Rule 32 requires the district court to

range based on a ground not previously identified by the

6

PSR of the parties, including a departure based on the

factors in section 3553(a).

under section 3553(a) fall squarely within the term

defined in the Guidelines.

Well, why shouldn't this

rule be dealt with by further rulemaking?

clear that when 32(h) was adopted, departure had a

14

specific meaning under the Guidelines.

talking about now was not contemplated at all by the

rulemakers at that time.

It is very

the fact is that they required notice of all -- that --

16

that -- that they were requiring notice of all

17

deviations that were available.

18

notice -- at a minimum, rule 32(h) is still there and it

19

continues to apply to traditional departures.

20

Now they should require

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The rules advisory

21

committee is currently considering whether or not to

22

change this, right?

23

MR. ROBERTS:

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

Yes.

But

It -Nobody in that

process has suggested, well, it's too bad you've already

4

decided this in 32(h)?
MR. ROBERTS:

Well, yes.

One of the -- they

have, Your Honor.
One of the things that the advisory

5

committee stated that it was going to consider was --

6

was lower court decisions on the question -- on the

7

question of whether notice -- the current text of rule

8

32(h) requires notice to be given.

9

So that might have been one of the reasons

10

that some people in the conference were reluctant to

11

adopt an amendment.

12

that the courts were considering the question, and many

13

people expressed concern that an amendment was

14

premature, that the -- that the conference should await

15

further guidance from the courts and from this Court.

16

Another reason was that they knew

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

A lot of judges

17

objected to the idea they would adopt the position

18

you're urging here.

19

MR. ROBERTS:

That's true.

Some judges did

20

object to that.

21

other -- some judges expressed support for that

22

interpretation, and there were varying reasons that were

23

motivating different people in the conference to take

24

the position that the conference should wait.

25

But others -- as I said, there were

The fact is -- and so the Court shouldn't
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

construe from the failure to enact an amendment just

2

like the Court is reluctant to construe from the failure

3

to amend a statute that the current provision doesn't

4

require notice.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's not inferring

6

from the failure to act.

It is just a recognition that

7

these things are looked at very carefully by the rules

8

committees and they look at it in a broad way and take

9

in all the information.

We know they're doing that now.

10

And we would be kind of jumping the gun and short

11

circuiting that process.

12

MR. ROBERTS:

I don't think so, because

13

they've -- they've referred it back to the subcommittee

14

and said they want to wait and see what -- what this

15

Court does and what the courts to.

16

So, they're waiting for you.

Doesn't seem

17

like in that circumstance it makes sense for you to wait

18

for them.

19

But however you interpret the current

20

rule -- and the question before you is what the current

21

rule requires.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

May I ask you this

24

question about the rule:

It says before the court may

not identified for departure.

2

say possible grounds for departure are as follows, and

3

then list them?

4

"identified for departure" means as recommended by the

5

pre-sentencing report?

6

Can a pre-sentence report

Or does this, in your view, mean that

MR. ROBERTS:

No.

I think that the

7

pre-sentence report doesn't actually have to recommend

8

it.

9

a section that does this although, although often they

10

The pre-sentence report -- and they generally have

don't identify --

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, could the

12

pre-sentencing report just list a series of -- a whole

13

series of factors saying these are possible grounds for

14

departure?

15

Would that comply with the rule?
MR. ROBERTS:

I mean, at a certain point it

16

wouldn't, but if it listed more than one as a possible

17

ones and they were identified with sufficient

18

specificity to enable --

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Would future

dangerousness -- future dangerousness be something that

21

could be put in the report and that would cover these --

MR. ROBERTS:

we're talking about very much.
22
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. ROBERTS:

2

No.

That's required.

But what -- what it does show is that

3

this is a possibility that an out of Guidelines sentence

4

is a possibility and this is the ground on which it is a

5

possibility.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA?

What if the ground is I

7

just simply believe that the Guidelines' recommendation

8

for arson when there are people in the building is

9

simply too low?

Okay?

You give notice of that.

10

good is giving notice of that going to do?

11

Isn't too low.

Is too low.

Is too low.

Isn't too low.

12

MR. ROBERTS:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What

I mean --

The parties can -It's almost, you know, a

14

determination of the judge's gut feeling of what is

15

condign punishment for a particular --

16

MR. ROBERTS:

The parties -- the parties

17

would be able to focus on that and try to inform the

judge's decision on that.

19

of -- that's not the only kind of ground on which a

20

court might vary, and that may not be one for which

21

advance notice would be particularly helpful, but there

22

are many on which it is.

23

But that's not the only kind

If I can give an example of a case we

24

recently confronted, for example?

We had a case in

25

which a judge imposed probation on a defendant who was
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

convicted of soliciting child pornography because the

2

judge was under the belief that prison couldn't provide

3

the necessary treatment.

4

We hadn't presented any evidence on

5

available treatment programs, but we certainly would

6

have done that if we had had notice that the court was

7

contemplating varying on that ground.

8

didn't do that, there was no adversary presentation of

9

that.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And because we

Couldn't you have asked

11

at the hearing, couldn't you ask the judge:

12

please have a continuance here because you have taken us

13

by surprise and we'd like to offer some evidence that

14

you -- that might influence you?

15

MR. ROBERTS:

Judge,

You could -- we could

16

certainly do that.

17

that would be an after-the-fact situation.

18

rule 32 is trying to do is set up a procedure so that in

every case, in every case you get the adversarial

20

presentation on the grounds --

and didn't get a precise answer:

have to be given?

much does it have to say?

MR. ROBERTS:

parties enough time to present the adversarial process

on the question.

The question is, is the

sufficient; but -- but the -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

the reasons, Your Honor, that we said that the -- that

it's failure to give notice of a variance here was

a possible departure on a very similar ground.

23

First of all, the PSR had already identified

dangerousness was central to the victim impact testimony

of his wife who had notice was going to testify.
25
Alderson Reporting Company

He

knew from the PSR what she was going to say.

-- that all goes to the harmless error question.

that the only time in which notice at the sentencing

8

hearing is going to be adequate?

9

MR. ROBERTS:

No, Your Honor.

Is

But I think

10

in this circumstance, for example, there would be --

11

another example would be often if the victim impact

12

testimony -- there hadn't been identified as a potential

13

ground for departure on it, but the judge heard victim

14

impact testimony, but the defendant knew the victim was

15

going to testify, had the general sense it and the judge

16

when it heard -- when she heard it decided, wow, you

17

know, this really makes me think I should take it out of

18

the sentence, I think that because the -- because the

19

defendant knew that the testimony was going to be there,

20

knew the gist of it and was prepared to respond to it,

21

would probably be sufficient to give notice at that time

22

then.

23

For instance, if the judge relied on remorse

24

in allocution -- lack of remorse in allocution that's

25

another example where I think, you know, notice at the

it will be impossible for judges to make their

true that before the hearing, they're going to have some

2

sense based on the written materials that they've

reviewed and based on the parties' identifications of

what they think the appropriate sentence is.

5

Petitioner's counsel explained, in the vast majority of

6

cases, the PSR, the parties are already going to

7

identify the potential grounds for a variance, and so

8

it's very few cases that there's going to be a ground

have to be?

one of the 3553(a) factors.

As

I take it it's not enough just to recite

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, at a minimum, the court

would have to identify the relevant 3553(a) factor.

15

think then what more is required depends a little bit on

the particular factor, the record in the case.

17

the test is to ensure that they focus adversarial

presentation.

19

like the nature and circumstances of the offense and the

be required.

I

Again,

If it's a really an open-ended factor,

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what was required

here?

24

MR. ROBERTS:

Here I think it would have

25

been sufficient for the judge to say.
28
Alderson Reporting Company

I'm contemplating

Official - Subject to Final Review

a variance under section 3553(a)(2)(C), based on the

2

fact that Petitioner's conduct indicates that he is

3

likely to commit future crimes.

4
5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you disagree with

the Petitioner on the specificity of notice required?

6

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

We don't think that

7

notice of the specific fact on which the court is going

8

to rely is required.

9

notice requirement unworkable, but I don't think that's

10

how it's been interpreted, to require the very specific

11

facts in the departure context.

12

That would start to make the

The same situation, the parallel thing

13

applies here.

14

burdensomeness, it hasn't been burdensome, unduly

15

burdensome, to require notice for traditional, and there

16

really isn't any reason to think that it would be

17

different for here.

18

As I was going to say before on the

And to get back to something earlier as well

19

that we're were talking about, the key fact is rule

20

32(h) does indisputably require notice for traditional

21

departures.

22

essential to prevent evisceration of that notice

23

requirement because a court can always impose the

24

same -- use a variance to impose the same sentence that

25

it could have imposed as a Guidelines departure.

And a notice requirement for variances is

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

So that notice requirement, which is still

2

in the rule, is going to basically become meaningless

3

unless the word "departure" is given it full scope and

4

construed to include variances.

5

And notices of variances is also necessary

6

for the focused adversarial testing that rule 32

7

requires for the reason the Court said in Burns.

8

parties don't know what the potential grounds for a

9

non-Guidelines sentence are, then what they're likely to

If the

10

do is either address the possibility of an

11

above-Guidelines sentence in a random and wasteful way

12

by trying to conceive of every possible grounds or

13

they're just not going to address it at all, like in the

14

example that I gave before when we just didn't address

15

the potential variance based on prison not providing --

16

being able to provide the appropriate treatment.

17
18
19

And it's still important, even after Booker,
to have adversarial testing of that issue.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

Could we go back to the

20

example for just a minute?

I want to be sure I fully

21

understand it.

22

adequately discussed at a hearing in which there was no

23

particular notice, but at the end of the hearing the

24

judge said, this is what I'm planning to do because I'm

worried that they won't get treatment in prison and so

Why couldn't that issue have been

Alderson Reporting Company

forth?

Well, wouldn't the government have had an

2

opportunity to then say, Judge, you overlooked this

3

fact?

And wouldn't all involved in the hearing?

4

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, what we would have liked

5

to do is bring in people to explain to the judge these

6

are the programs that are available.

7
8

JUSTICE STEVENS:

This is --

Couldn't the lawyer have

done that?

9

MR. ROBERTS:

That's how it works.

Well, I

10

think the lawyer probably could have said we have -- we

11

have treatments and they work.

--

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

14

MR. ROBERTS:

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

problem because the judge apparently was operating under

a misunderstanding of facts.

judge thought was that there were no available

treatments that would work.

22
23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And it -And the lawyer could say

you're wrong.
MR. ROBERTS:

have dissuaded the judge there, but it didn't give us

the opportunity to bring in somebody who -31

MR. ROBERTS:

No, I understand.

-- who knows how it -- you

3

know, who knows what the programs are, to explain it.

Whatever the judge said, yes, I know you have these

programs, but the programs that you can do in prison --

6

you know, I just don't think that those are effective.

7

And --

8
9
10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, if you think

you have a particularly good case that they are, again
you make that point to the judge.

11

MR. ROBERTS:

But --

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If you can see what

13

the last report about these programs was like, you

wouldn't think that.

maybe he will based on his own experience in dealing

with those types of --

And I think a reasonably competent

Or

The judge is -- you know,

19

counsel can make the argument.

But in certain cases,

20

the ability to present actual evidence on it is going to

21

be an important -- is going to be an important factor.

22

There's, you know, other examples:

23

available for other things or that people have been

essence of what the requirement --

That's the -- that's the

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

5

MR. ROBERTS:

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

7

-- and the rules get at.
In your experience, do

judges often bring in experts on this kind of stuff?

8
9

In your --

MR. ROBERTS:

Judges -- do judges bring in

experts?
JUSTICE STEVENS:

10

Well, not judges -- do

11

judges say, "Oh, this is very interesting; I'm going to

12

have a new hearing"?

13

go on?

14

I mean, how long do these hearings

MR. ROBERTS:

We would have -- if -- I think

15

that we would -- could bring in someone and testify

16

about -- to present evidence on that for sure, if the

17

judge was thinking of imposing probation because there

18

was no treatment program.

19

very long, but we could have someone come in for a few

20

minutes and -- and do that.

21

It wouldn't have to go on for

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But you're saying that,

22

routinely in sentencing matters, you have expert who

23

come in and advise the judge of programs and so forth?

24
25

MR. ROBERTS:

Not routinely, but, you know,

generally that's not an issue.

That's why we didn't do

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it in this -- in this particular sentencing hearing.

2

The point is that, you know, we're not going to do that.

3

And so a judge that's operating under that and it's

4

going to vary on that ground isn't going to get that

5

information because we're -- as you say -- we're not

6

going to just want to delay all the hearings for that

7

reason.

8

And so that -- it's really the reason that

9

the requirement in the existing rule is there, and the

10

reasons behind that apply with equal force in the

11

variance context.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you think that this

13

case is a poor example because you're urging us to apply

14

the harmless error rule and say this case would have

15

come out the same way --

16

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes -- I mean, it's not the

17

best -- it's not the best example to illustrate to the

18

Court why notice is required because here we do think

19

that the error was harmless for various reasons.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If we -- if we grant the

21

review so we can resolve the question, does the judge

22

have to give notice or not?

23

notice, what time?

24
25

And if she has to give

What content?

But now you're urging us to say -- to do
something that ordinarily this Court doesn't do, that
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

trial judges do, to deal with harmless error, which

2

would be spending our time on this very particular case

3

setting no law for any other case?

4

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, we think the Court

5

should, you know, first obviously address the rule 32

6

question on which it granted certain certiorari, but

7

after doing that, we think the Court should address the

8

harmless error question because that will provide useful

9

guidance to the lower courts.

There are likely to be a

10

lot of harmless error cases because half of the circuits

11

have erroneously concluded that the rule doesn't require

12

notice, and they could benefit from an illustration of

13

how to apply it in this particular context --

14
15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I suppose we'll have

--

16

MR. ROBERTS:

-- involving variance.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I suppose we'll have

18

a lot of appeals about the adequacy of the notice.

19

and the Petitioner disagree on that, and appellate

20

courts will have to address that as well.

21
22

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, I think this is an easy

case for an appellate court to address because --

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

MR. ROBERTS:

25

You

Yes.

This may be --

-- regarding whether the

notice would be adequate -35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry.

This may

2

be an easy case, but you can imagine others that aren't

3

going to be.

4

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, but the questions about

5

adequacy of notice are really no different in kind than

6

the same questions that come up for the traditional

7

departure rule.

8

this Court resolves the case for the notice of

9

Guidelines departures.

It's still going to be there, however

So I don't think that you're opening a --

10
11

whole new questions about adequacy, just as like you're

12

not opening up a whole set of new questions about

13

timing.

14

going to have to confront them.

Those questions are there, and the courts are

But in discussing the harmlessness issue

15
16

here, you could shed some light on those questions that

17

can provide some guidance for the lower courts that will

18

be useful to them in the future.

19

to do that.

And we would urge you

Turning to the harmlessness, in addition to

20
21

the fact that the PSR gave notice -- do you want me to

22

continue?

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

MR. ROBERTS:

25

Sure.

Continue.

Finish.

In addition to the fact

that future dangerousness was central to sentencing,
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it's also true that the evidence that Petitioner now

2

says he wouldn't have presented wouldn't have made a

3

difference because his counsel essentially made the same

4

argument to the district court, and he could have used

5

the expert testimony to support that argument, but he

6

chose not to.

7

The District Court had already rejected the

8

defense of expert diagnosis the Petitioner was

9

delusional and could be treated with anti-psychotic

10

drugs and adopted the government expert's diagnosis that

11

Petitioner had a personality disorder that was

12

longstanding and unlikely to change.

16

FOR AMICUS CURIAE,

17

IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW

18
19
20

MR. RUTLEDGE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Court has before it today two

21

alternative grounds to affirm the judgment below.

22

first is suggested by Justice Ginsburg and Chief Justice

23

Roberts that paragraph 78 of the presentence report put

24

the parties on adequate notice that they could engage in

25

a full adversarial testing outweighing the defendant's
37
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

future dangerousness against his amenability to

2

alternative methods of treatment.

3

The alternative ground for affirming the

4

judgment below is that suggested by Justice Scalia and

5

Justice Alito, namely:

6

Procedure 32(h) was drafted for a different era, an era

7

of mandatory guidelines.

8

particularly in light of the right rulemaking process,

9

to extend rule 32 to an advisory guideline era.

That Federal Rule of Criminal

And there is no reason,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

But then it would be easy

11

for a district judge to escape any obligation to give

12

32(h) notice because he could simply say:

13

before I would have ranked this as a Sentencing

14

Guidelines matter, but now I'm treating it as a 3553(a)

15

factor, so I don't have to bother with 32(h) anymore.

16

MR. RUTLEDGE:

Oh, yeah,

Justice Ginsburg, I

17

understand your concern about the possibility that

18

district judges might, I guess in theory, attempt to do

19

an end run around rule 32(h) by recasting a departure

20

decision as a variance decision.

21

And, admittedly, there are certain

22

circumstances in which the ground for a departure on

23

rule 32(h) has some overlap with the ground for a

24

variance under 3553(a), but I would offer several

25

responses.

My first response is that I feel the Court
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

crossed that bridge a little bit in the Booker remedial

2

opinion when it created an advisory guidelines system.

3

The whole premise of the advisory guidelines system was

4

to enhance the discretion of the district judge.

5

My second answer would be that district

6

judges still have a reason to engage in the departure

7

calculation.

8

judges must begin by consulting the guidelines.

9

Second, Third, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Tenth Courts of

As this Court made clear in Rita, district
And the

10

Appeal all have interpreted that obligation to consult

11

the Guidelines to include consideration of possible

12

grounds for departure.

13

Of course, this Court's decision in

14

Kimbrough made clear that even if those two grounds

15

don't provide the judge adequate incentive to engage in

16

a departure calculation, that there is yet another

17

reason; and that is because it may affect the

18

scrutiny-of-reasonableness review.

19

As the Court explained in Kimbrough, when a

20

district judge departs from the Guidelines, the district

21

judge's determination may be entitled to greater respect

22

when the judge makes the determination that a case

23

takes -- that a circumstance takes the case outside of

24

the heartland.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

But didn't the decision that
39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the Guidelines are not mandatory make what used to be

2

known as Guidelines departures completely irrelevant?

3

case that would qualify for a Guidelines departure

4

would, by definition, be a case in which the 3553(a)

5

factors justified a sentence other than a Guidelines

6

sentence?

7

go through the departure analysis any longer at all.

So I don't understand why there's any need to

8
9

A

MR. RUTLEDGE:

Justice Alito, I don't

believe that this Court's Booker and post-Booker

10

jurisprudence has made the departure determination

11

irrelevant.

12

Indeed, just this last Friday, the

13

Sentencing Commission posted on its website additional

14

proposed amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines that

15

would inject new grounds for departures including fraud

16

for emergency assistance and violations of Federal food

17

and drug laws that entail a risk of serious bodily

18

injury.

19

Departures remain relevant to the guidelines

20

because they are the basis upon which the Commission can

21

continue to fulfill its mandate to provide for the type

22

of uniform sentencing that still is possible.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

I just don't understand

24

that.

You're not -- a court -- a sentencing court,

25

after concluding that there is no ground for a departure
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

under Booker and the later cases, then has to consider

2

the 3553(a) question.

3

So the decision about the departures is

4

irrelevant.

5

finds that the case qualified for a Guidelines

6

departure, as I said before, by definition, that is

7

going to be a case where the 3553(a) factors warranted a

8

non-Guidelines sentence anyway.

9

useless appendage at this point.

10

It is not dispositive; and, if the court

MR. RUTLEDGE:

So it seems like a

Well, it may well be the

11

case, Justice Alito, that as this Court's Booker

12

jurisprudence unfolds, that the concept of a departure

13

declines in importance, in addition with respect to the

14

32(h) obligation for notice.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, why is the 32(h)

16

obligation relevant?

That is, looking through the

17

history of it, I see that in 32(i)(C) it says that the

18

government has to allow the parties' attorneys to

19

comment on the determination of the probation officer

20

and other matters relating to an appropriate sentence.

21

Then, in a case called Burns v. United

22

States, this Court says that that right to comment

23

includes a right to notice.

24
25

And so all that 32(h) did was to take what
was already the law and make specific that it includes a
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

right to notice.

2

to.

3

I take it that was what they were up

But even if you didn't have 32(h), you would

4

have precisely the same right once you got 32(i)(C)

5

together with the case of Burns.

6

So I don't know where that leaves me, except

7

thinking it doesn't matter, because the defendant has

8

precisely the same right either way.

9

easier just to say "departure" means generally all kinds

10

And I guess it's

of departures including not applying it.

11

That's not a stretch of the language.

It is

12

quite right it is not consistent with what they thought

13

they were up to, but not -- it is -- maybe before -- if

14

they had passed this before Hawaii became a State, you

15

could say:

16

Hawaii.

17
18
19

Well, they didn't think it would apply in

So what?

I mean would you decrease that,

General?
MR. RUTLEDGE:

Certainly, Justice Breyer.

20

If we were to put 32(h) to one side and consider the

21

effect of rule 32(i)(1)(C), then the Court confronts the

22

question whether the basic ideas that animated its

23

decision in Burns should be extended in an

24

advisory-guidelines era.

25

on two distinct strands of reasoning.

And Burns, at bottom, rested

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

One was the question of unfair surprise.

2

And we think, with that respect, that the post-Booker

3

era is different from the pre-Booker era.

4

reason why, Justice Breyer, is because pre-Booker the

5

parties came to the sentencing hearing with an

6

expectation of a within-Guidelines sentence.

7

And the

And post-Booker, particularly in light of

8

this Court's decision in Rita, the parties cannot come

9

to the sentencing hearing with that expectation because

10

the district judge may not presume the reasonableness of

11

the within-Guidelines sentence.

12

And so to the extent that Burns rested on

13

concerns of unfair surprise, the rationale has dropped

14

out after Booker.

15

Now, there is a second strand of reasoning

16

to Burns which Justice Ginsburg alluded to, which is

17

this question of full adversarial testing.

18

with you, Chief Justice Roberts, that Chief Judge

19

Boudin's decision in the Vega-Santiago case provides the

20

pathway here.

21

And I agree

Judges engage in this kind of discretionary

22

act all the time.

Parties come to the hearing with a

23

theory, a theory of how the judge should exercise her

24

sentencing discretion within a known range, and knowing

25

the applicable legal criteria, and have an opportunity
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to be heard.

2

And we believe that, particularly in light

3

of the recent amendment to section 32(d)(2)(F), that's

4

going to include the possibility of the 3553 factors --

5

3553, a factor in the presentence report, that the

6

parties are going to have the opportunity to come to the

7

hearing with the ability to engage in full adversarial

8

testing.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you accept Chief

10

Judge Boudean's safety valve as well?

11

if the basis for the variance is going to be a matter of

12

surprise, then notice is required?

13

MR. RUTLEDGE:

In other words,

I accept the first part of

14

that premise, Chief Justice Roberts:

15

be rare cases of truly unfair surprise.

16

That they are may

What I don't necessarily accept is that

17

notice has to be the straitjacketed remedy for District

18

Judges in all of those instances.

19

There may be other mechanisms such as if

20

the -- if the fact is, if you will, sprung on the

21

parties in the midst of the hearing, a motion for a

22

continuance, as the government indicates on page 44 of

23

its brief, may be a mechanism to control against those

24

cases of truly unfair surprise.

25

appeals under this Court's decision in Pickett,

And then a court of

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reviewing the appropriateness of granting or denying the

2

continuance, can base its appellate review on whether or

3

not unfair surprise --

4
5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
discretion standardized?

6
7

MR. RUTLEDGE:

That is an abuse of

discretion --

8
9

That is an abuse of

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Unworkable or is there

just as many impracticalities as the rule.
MR. RUTLEDGE:

10

I -- I don't think that it

11

presents a concern of impracticability, Justice Kennedy,

12

for one simple reason; and that is by relying on a

13

mechanism such as the continuance, the parties are given

14

the opportunity to identify for the court whether or not

15

there's a concern of unfair surprise; and if there is,

16

the district judge is in the position to decide whether

17

or not she believes that the continuance is necessary.

18

If the notice claim only arises at the time

19

that the sentence is entered, there's relatively little

20

opportunity at that point for the district judge to go

21

back and reconsider the record on the basis of unfair

22

surprise.

23

that Justices Souter, Alito and Justice Ginsburg all

24

talk, about which is the fundamental unworkability of

25

the notice rule and advisory guidelines system.

And that sort of takes me to the basic point

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

As the judges -- the district judges

2

explained to us in the recent rulemaking proceeding

3

contemplating a amendment to rule 32(h), they're

4

concerned that extending this rule to variances will

5

make it quite difficult.

6

We know that district judges often receive

7

these packets of sentencing information only seven days

8

before the sentencing hearing.

9

appeals have held that giving notice at the sentencing

Several courts of

10

hearing is not timely.

11

concern can be overcome, there are serious problems in

12

workability as to the adequacy of the notice.

13

And even if the timeliness

The best that the Petitioner and the

14

government the instruct this Court on, in terms of how

15

the adequacy standard is going to work, is that it has

16

to be context-specific; and if we put ourselves in the

17

shoes of a district judge that now has to engage in a

18

discretionary act to decide whether or not the notice

19

that I've given is adequate turns on the context,

20

doesn't provide a great deal of guidance to the district

21

judge.

22

We know, for example --

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why isn't it just

24

whatever is the reason that the judge is considering is

25

going outside the advisory Guidelines, whatever that
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reason is, just say it.

2

here, "I'm contemplating going outside because I don't

3

think that this man is going to stop these threats."

4

Period.

5

So the judge says -- could say

That's all.
MR. RUTLEDGE:

I -- certainly,

6

Justice Ginsburg.

And I've wrestled with that own

7

question in -- in my mind.

8

said I'm thinking of sentencing outside the Guidelines

9

because I'm dealing with an individual who has a

If this judge were to have

10

demonstrated ability to stalk and threaten his ex-wife,

11

would that have been adequate?

12

think pages 23 and 126 of the Petitioner's reply brief

13

illustrate that either the answer to that question is

14

going to be "not necessarily," or otherwise appellate

15

judges are going to be strung up having to unpack

16

whether or not notice is adequate, because it is

17

Petitioner's petition in this case that even if the

18

defendant had been put on notice as to the future

19

dangerousness, that that did not, quote, "put the

20

defendant on notice" that the district judge supposed

21

the futility of treatment might justify an

22

outside-the-Guidelines sentencing.

23

And interestingly, I

Here's the essential workability problem.

24

We know from this court's decision in Rita that the

25

basic vision in the post-Booker world is to encourage
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

judges to provide reasoned sentencing decisions, where a

2

degree of reasoning may depend a little bit upon whether

3

the judge is engaging an inside-the-advisory-Guidelines

4

sentence, or an outside-the-advisory-Guidelines

5

sentence.

6

In the event that a district judge engaging

7

in an outside-the-Guidelines sentence, she is now

8

walking into a trap.

9

a determination about the defendant's future

Because if she imposes it based on

10

dangerousness, and then in an attempt to provide a full

11

explication of her reasoning makes a statement about the

12

amenability or non-amenability of the defendant to

13

alternative forms of treatment, the aggrieved party will

14

seize on that extra statement and bring it back to the

15

pre-sentencing report and the parties' pleadings and

16

said we may have had notice as to ground one to the

17

variance but we didn't have notice as to ground two.

18

we may have had notice as to ground one and two, but we

19

didn't have any as to ground three.

20

Or

This is the essentially workability concern

21

that we believe that the district judges raised when

22

they expressed their discomfort with the proposed

23

amendments to rule 32(h); and precisely why we think the

24

more prudent course is to affirm the judgment below,

25

either on the narrow ground that I started start with,
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the Chief Justice's question suggested, or alternatively

2

on the broader grounds suggested by Justice Scalia's

3

questions, that the resume that emerged at the time of

4

mandatory Guidelines should not be extended to the time

5

of advisory Guidelines.

6

And if I could make one last observation,

7

and then I'll complete my argument unless the Court has

8

further questions.

9

In December of 2007, the Advisory Committee

10

on Criminal Rules formed a subcommittee to study this

11

problem.

12

meeting, they didn't form that subcommittee because they

13

were awaiting this Court's decision in Irizarry.

14

formed that -- cert hadn't been granted in Irizarry.

If the Court consults the minutes of that

They

They formed that subcommittee for two

15
16

reasons.

17

Court's decisions in Gall and Kimbrough a notice

18

requirement was still necessary; and second was the

19

consideration that in light of the breadth of the

20

3553(a) factors a notice requirement should be removed

21

altogether.

22

narrow grounds suggested by Chief Justice Roberts or the

23

broader grounds suggested by Justice Scalia is to affirm

24

the judgment below.

25

The first reason was whether in light of this

The more prudent course either for the

If the Court has no further questions I
49
Alderson Reporting Company

would be happy to yield back the balance of my time.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you, Counsel.

3

Mr. Madden, you have two minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR J. MADDEN, III

5

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

6

MR. MADDEN:

Thank you.

7

I think Justice Breyer is correct that rule

8

32(e) is -- requires that the parties have an

9

opportunity to comment on matters appropriate to the

10

sentencing.

11

Guidelines departures but also what has been called

12

variances.

13

that that -- that right comes with a notice requirement.

14

The first is that fairness for the individual defendant,

15

the ability to litigate the issues that are going to

16

make a difference in his sentencing.

17

That opportunity extends to not only

There are two reasons why it's important

The other is that it permits as an

18

institutional issue effective appellate review, if

19

there's a developed record and evolution of the

20

Guidelines by looking at the aggregate of cases.

21

Court's decision is that we're going to exempt from

22

notice requirement the cases that are going -- the

23

sentences that are going to be driven towards the

24

margin, high or low, the goal of uniformity that

25

Congress sought in the Sentencing Reform Act would be
50
Alderson Reporting Company

If the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

lost.

2

And I submit that that's an independent

3

reason why the Court ought to require notice is because

4

otherwise, it's inviting the sentencing disparities

5

which the architecture of the Sentencing Reform Act is

6

designed to eliminate.

7

As far as workability, it is extremely rare

8

that the issues aren't flagged in the papers.

9

going to come up frequently.

It is not

Rule 32(h) issues don't

10

come up terribly frequently, at least in my practice in

11

the appellate cases.

12

Five circuits below have -- saw no

13

workability problem with extending the notice

14

requirement of rule 32(h) to variances as well.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

MR. MADDEN:

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you, Counsel.

Thank you.
Mr. Rutledge, you

of the judgment below upon appointment by this Court,

assignment.
