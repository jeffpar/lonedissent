ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN C. NEWSOM

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

9
10

MR. NEWSOM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

This appeal presents two issues, both a

12

threshold jurisdictional question and a substantive

13

question concerning scope of section 5.

14

explained in some detail in our briefs why Governor

15

Riley's appeal in this case is timely and why this Court

16

has jurisdiction to resolve the merit.

17

General has agreed with us on the jurisdictional

18

question.

19

We have

The Solicitor

I certainly want to answer any questions

20

that the Court may have concerning the jurisdictional

21

issue, but with the Court's permission I would like to

22

proceed in my affirmative presentation directly to the

23

merits, and specifically the second of two independent

24

bases that we have urged for reversal here.

25

argument under this Court's decision in Young versus
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Our

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Fordice is perhaps the simplest and most straightforward

2

way to resolve this case.

3

that a state voter registration plan, despite its

4

promulgation, preclearance and active implementation to

5

register 4,000 voters, was nonetheless in force or

6

effect within the meaning of section 5 and thus was not

7

a valid section 5 baseline for purposes of measuring

8

future changes, because the Court said it resulted only

9

from a temporary misapplication of State law and it was

In Young, this Court held

10

immediately corrected upon acknowledgment that it was

11

unlawful in fact.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's pretty hard to

13

argue something wasn't in force and effect when they

14

have an election under it, isn't it?

15

MR. NEWSOM:

Your Honor, I don't think --

16

Your Honor is correct that the only possible distinction

17

between Young and this case is the holding of the 1987

18

election, but I don't think the election can make the

19

difference here, for this reason:

20

virtue of the vagaries of the State litigation process.

21

The challenge preceded the election by two months.

22

election was conducted under a cloud of litigation that

23

everyone certainly knew about and it went forward only

24

because, in the wake of Young, the trial court

25

temporarily misapplied State law.

It preceded solely by

4
Alderson Reporting Company

That

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

If a trial court had gotten State law right

2

to begin with, Your Honor, and had enjoined the election

3

as we now all know it should have, then there never

4

would have been the election to point to as evidence

5

that 85-237 ever went into force or effect.

6

seems to me inconceivable, consistent with any

7

meaningful notion of federalism, that section 5 can

8

require a world in which a State trial court, as we say

9

in the reply brief, which exists at the bottom of the

And it

10

state judicial hierarchy, can by getting State law wrong

11

in the first place lock into State law as a section 5

12

baseline an unconstitutional statute.

13

on this side of the podium anyway, to be denying that

14

85-237 was, is now and was at its inception,

15

unconstitutional and thereby strip the Alabama Supreme

16

Court of its sovereign prerogative to correct the errors

17

of lower courts.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I don't anybody,

What if there had been no

19

challenge to that election, but two or three years later

20

somebody challenged the election and then the Supreme

21

Court said it was invalid.

22

MR. NEWSOM:

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

24
25

Well, Justice Stevens -Then there never would

have been a State statute.
MR. NEWSOM:

I'm sorry?

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Then there never would

have been a State statute, a valid State statute.

3

MR. NEWSOM:

Right.

There are -- we have

4

pitched two different arguments in this case, Your

5

Honor.

6

broader of the two arguments, contained in Roman II of

7

our brief, that, the later action, nonetheless would not

8

be a change under section 5.

9

that I was talking about specifically under Young versus

And under the, I think it's fair, to say the

But under the argument

10

Fordice, I think it does make a difference that the

11

Alabama Supreme Court stepped in at the earliest

12

possible opportunity to invalidate this statute, again

13

as part of litigation that preceded the first and only

14

implementation, attempted implementation, of the

15

statute.

16

And I think the question at bottom here in

17

this case is whether section 5 provides State courts

18

with any breathing space whatsoever in which to conduct

19

this exercise of judicial review, and our submission is

20

that at the very least that it ought to extend so far as

21

to allow State courts to step in, as they did here, at

22

the earliest possible opportunity.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If the respondent prevails

24

in this case and you have a case similar to this one

25

that begins in the trial court, how do you think it
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would work, that the plaintiffs in the trial court

2

action have to get preclearance either way?

3

to get preclearance in the event that they prevail?

4

then the other side has to get preclearance in the event

5

that it doesn't.

6

in your view?

And

I mean, is that the way it would work

7

MR. NEWSOM:

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

They have

I'm not frankly -If I'm in State trial

court, how can I make a ruling if -- assuming the

10

respondents win in this case, if I know there has to be

11

preclearance?

12

MR. NEWSOM:

Well, I think, Your Honor,

13

that's certainly part of the point that we've emphasized

14

here as one of the key federalism issues in this case,

15

is that this case really does in a very functional way

16

strip State courts of their jurisdiction to exercise

17

judicial review, whether at the trial court stage or at

18

the supreme court stage because on Appellee's theory

19

once the statute is precleared it is effectively locked

20

in place and that the trial court or the supreme court

21

needs permission from the Executive Branch in Washington

22

to exercise the authority to --

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I suppose States get --

24

State courts get preclearance all the time with district

25

changes, don't they?

Or how does it work?
7

Alderson Reporting Company

They just

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

hold the judgment in abeyance until there is

2

preclearance, and couldn't -- and if so, couldn't do you

3

that here?

4

MR. NEWSOM:

Well, to be sure the Appellees

5

are correct that it is the administration of the change

6

itself that requires preclearance.

7

Court to think that our position here is that courts are

8

having to -- to render sort of provisional judgments

9

that are then subject to preclearance in Washington.

So I don't want the

10

The point is that, so I think in the redistricting

11

example, Your Honor, it would be the implementation of

12

the redistricting that would require preclearance.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Are there any other

14

district cases that require preclearance except those

15

that redistrict the, the State?

16

MR. NEWSOM:

No Your Honor, and the point is

17

that no one here denies, certainly the State does not

18

deny, that a State court order redistricting, redrawing

19

a map, in essence, and giving rise or exercising what is

20

functionally, as this Court has said, a legislative

21

power requires redistricting.

22

the question here is quite different:

23

is a spectrum of State court decisions with

24

redistricting at one end, my case has to be at the other

25

end of the spectrum.

No one doubts that.

8
Alderson Reporting Company

But

Whether if there

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Are there district court --

2

there must be -- district court cases in which the State

3

trial court has invalidated on some State constitutional

4

ground legislation redistricting that has been passed by

5

the legislature?

6

been precleared?

7

When that happens, have those opinions

MR. NEWSOM:

Not to my knowledge, Your

8

Honor.

9

right off the top of my mind that fit that paradigm.

10
11

And I will confess that I'm not aware of any

But not to my knowledge.

The only --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But isn't the reason that

12

there would be no reason to preclear them?

13

the State court invalidates legislative redistricting,

14

and does so before there has been a preclearance

15

request, in other words, if it gets into State court

16

right off the bat, then there's no State law

17

subsequently to ask the feds to preclear.

18

MR. NEWSOM:

I mean, if

That might be right, Justice

19

Souter, but I'm not sure that I understand the

20

implications for this case.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If you could -Well, I guess what I'm

22

saying is your "No" answer does not prove much.

23

other words, you're trying to make the case here that

24

there is something extremely unusual about this.

25

thought your answer to Justice Scalia in effect was one
9
Alderson Reporting Company

In

And I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reason that it's unusual is that we don't have any of

2

these cases in, in which a State court has knocked out a

3

State law that is then subject to some kind of

4

preclearance review.

5

understand the situation, as long as the preclearance

6

review had not preceded the State constitutionality

7

judgment, following the State constitutionality judgment

8

there would be no law to take to Washington, whether it

be to -- to the Justice Department or to -- or to the

And my only point was, if I

10

Court, and ask to have precleared.

11

there are no such cases doesn't prove anything.

12

MR. NEWSOM:

So the fact that

Well, I think the point that I

13

was trying to make, Your Honor, is that this Court has

14

said in construing section 5 that it will not construe

15

it so as to exacerbate federalism costs.

16

reasons that the federalism costs are exacerbated here

17

is that this is -- this scenario is simply unlike any,

18

as we say in the brief, that this Court has --

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, that may be -But you said in answer to

21

Justice Souter that this is your case.

22

that's precleared.

23

MR. NEWSOM:

And one of the

There is no law

Well, it's certainly true, Your

24

Honor, that when a state Court, as any court --

25

Court made clear only last month in Danforth, when a
10
Alderson Reporting Company

as this

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

court exercises judicial review to invalidate a practice

2

that's unconstitutional it is not changing or making new

3

law as it goes along, but declaring what the law has

4

always been.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There is a law to be

6

cleared if you -- if you assume that the existence of a

7

law to be cleared occurs before that law has been tested

8

in the courts.

9

discussing, just as in this case, there was a State law

In the hypothetical we've been

10

and if you assume the State law is valid before it's

11

gone through the judicial clearance process, there is a

12

State law change when the clearance process results in

13

striking down the law.

14

the two situations are pretty parallel.
MR. NEWSOM:

15

I don't -- it seems to me that

Well, with respect, Justice

16

Scalia, my case is the latter situation, where there was

17

technically a law in place.

19

the meaning of this Court's decision in Young is

20

different, but it was in place.

Now, whether it was in force or effect within

what point?

litigation?

24
25

85-257 to be sure was in

Alabama.

MR. NEWSOM:

Right.

The litigation was

commenced in April of 1987.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

And so your point is that

12

court in this, the circuit court and the supreme court?

13
14
15

MR. NEWSOM:

For purposes of this

litigation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if the circuit

16

court had gotten the State law right, then there never

17

would have been an election?

18

MR. NEWSOM:

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

20
21

Well, that's right.
There never would have been

perhaps preclearance if it got it right soon enough.
MR. NEWSOM:

Well, that's true, but of

22

course courts don't get to reach out and grab the

23

disputes and bring them into courts.

24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, but if the -- if the

challenging parties go into court at the first
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

opportunity and you don't have an election sort of

2

coming up next week, I would suppose that in cases like

3

that, the State would at least allow the State

4

litigation to proceed to some level.

5

fact that State litigation resulted in a declaration

6

that the new statute was unconstitutional in some

7

fashion, one would not expect the State then to bull

8

ahead and ask for preclearance, as opposed to trying

9

either to appeal at the State level or to correct the

10

And if in point of

statute.

11

MR. NEWSOM:

That's right, Your Honor, but

12

it -- but the challenge here would not have been ripe

13

until 1987.

14

so the challenge here was brought at the earliest

15

conceivable opportunity when the vacancy became a

16

reality.

There was no vacancy on the horizon.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And

I will assume that.
Even in the hypothetical

19

Justice Souter proposes, I don't know the rules in

20

Alabama, but I can see a Federal court saying:

21

this is premature; it hasn't been precleared; why should

22

I pass on the validity of something that might not be

23

precleared?

24
25

MR. NEWSOM:

Well,

Well, I think that's entirely

possible, Your Honor, and -13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

JUSTICE SCALIA:

On the other hand, I can

2

also see the attorney general saying:

3

in Alabama yet.

5
6

Why should I

It hasn't even been determined to be law

Does the Justice Department preclear stuff
that is -- that is in the midst of litigation?

7

MR. NEWSOM:

The Justice Department's

8

regulations at 51.22, Your Honor, say that they will not

9

preclear things that are not final and that are subject,

10

it says, to revision by court -- by court judgment.

11

that regulation is specific, the Federal Register

12

says --

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But

How does that apply to a

14

State statute which is fully enacted and then there's

15

going to be a challenge?

16

MR. NEWSOM:

The truth is the regulations

17

don't speak specifically to that question, and the

18

reason is that the regulations are quite clear in the

19

Federal Register at 46 Federal Register 872 that they

20

don't deal with changes, so-called, brought about as a

21

result of court judgments.

Do you know of any cases

6

MR. NEWSOM:

10

No, Your Honor, not right off

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It seems like an exercise

in futility.

11

MR. NEWSOM:

But the point -- Justice

12

Ginsburg, getting back to your point so you'll

13

appreciate the timeline, in April of 1987 the challenge

14

is brought.

15

So the challenge here preceded the election by two

16

months.

17

that the -- had the trial court gotten State law right

18

to begin with and enjoined the election, as we now know

19

it should have, there never would have been an election

20

to point to, to show within the meaning of Young that

21

the -- that the statute was ever put into force and

22

effect.

23

In June of 1987 the election goes forward.

And the point that I've been trying to make is

JUSTICE BREYER:

What happened -- I have a

24

factual question.

In around July, Mr. Sam Jones is

25

sworn in and now he is in office until sometime after, I
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

guess, September 1988, a little over a year, and then

2

the Governor appointed him.

3

paid during that year.

Yes.
And then when the Governor

6

appointed him, what does the appointment look like?

7

Does it say it's retroactive?

No.

MR. NEWSOM:

It must have said as of

The truth is, Your Honor, I do

not know what -JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I think it's

important to me because, for this reason:

I would guess

they don't make it retroactive or you'd know it, and

17

following facts, as to whether -- and this is what

Fordice says; it says this is a practical question.

It's not some theory about whether it's unconstitutional

21

or not unconstitutional.

matter was it in force and effect?

23

somebody was elected; three, he took office; four, he

25

held that office for a year and was paid for it.

We have the facts, the

And, as a practical

All

Official - Subject to Final Review

right?

Why, as a practical fact, as a practical matter,

2

we do not say that special election law was in force and

3

effect for about a year and two months?

4

MR. NEWSOM:

Your Honor, the difference, or

5

what makes this case just like Young versus Fordice, is

6

that the relevant -- the relevant implementation in

7

Young was not election.

The relevant implementation in

8

Young was registration.

And this Court's opinion makes

9

clear that 4,000 real, live flesh-and-blood voters were

10
11

registered.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, their registering is a

12

precondition of voting.

Not one person had ever voted.

13

Moreover, they all had to register again.

14

practical effect of the election, of plan two in Young

15

v. Fordice, was null, zero, zilch.

16

effect here is that somebody is elected under the law,

17

holds office for a year and two months, and is paid.

18

seems to me quite a big difference.

retroactive, but I do think that, given the nature of

the implementation, the relevant implementation in Young

being registration, the fact that 4,000 people were

registered does bring this case pretty close to Young.

Right.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

And --

And I'm saying if we start

7

from the base that the plan is special election which

8

was in force and effect for a year and two months, then

9

for whatever set of reasons there is a change, and the

10

State has to preclear the change.

11

answer to that?

12

MR. NEWSOM:

Now, what's the

The answer to that, Your Honor,

13

is that the shorthand misses the fact here that what

14

we're talking about is that the change results here from

15

a State court exercising judicial review.

16

-- that is different in kind from any sort of decision

17

that this Court has ever rendered about --

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

And this is

So you're

19

saying that if the cause of a change is a court

20

decision, then you do not have to preclear.

21

in Mississippi in 1975, there had been a ruling of a

22

court which said segregationist plan number one here is

23

no good, so we're going to go back to the even worse

24

plan that was before, that that wouldn't have had to

25

have been precleared?

MR. NEWSOM:

The point, Your Honor, is that

that --

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

You see where I'm going,

4

and I'm not phrasing it correctly, but you can answer it

5

anyway.

6

MR. NEWSOM:

So the point, Your Honor, is

7

that the result of that court decision would have been

8

immediately enjoined under the Fourteenth Amendment, the

9

Fifteenth Amendment, or section 2.

10

The point about

section 5 --

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It would have been able to

12

be brought up here if it was based on a discriminatory

13

intent, certainly.

14

MR. NEWSOM:

Absolutely.

This Court would

15

have cert jurisdiction if there were -- if you have the

16

--

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

But what my question is, is

18

there any authority for the proposition that between

19

1964 and today, it mattered whether the cause of a

20

change in a State plan was a decision of let's say five

21

members of a court -- of a State court -- or whether it

22

was a legislative decision.

23

you're arguing, and is there any authority that supports

24

you on that?

25

MR. NEWSOM:

Because that's what I think

If I -- if I may, Justice
20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Breyer, as a preface it's important that I emphasize

2

simply as sort of a superstructure point here that as --

3

not only as the plaintiff in this case, but as the party

4

asking the Court to exacerbate federalism costs, within

5

the meaning of Bossier Parish, over what they have been

6

to this point, I think it's my opponents' burden to show

7

you that Congress clearly intended to include these

8

provisions, as opposed to my burden to show you that

9

Congress intended to exclude them.

10
11

That's essentially

what this Court said in Gregory versus Ashcroft.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, they argue in their

12

brief that there were instances in which State supreme

13

courts participated prior to the enactment of the Voting

14

Rights Act in changes in election requirements for the

15

purposes of disenfranchising African-Americans.

16

they wrong on that?

17

reason is there to think that, without any text in

18

section 5 to making an exception for changes that are

19

made by State courts, what would be the reason for

20

reading that in?

21

Are

And if they're right on that, what

MR. NEWSOM:

Well, I think there are -- if I

22

can answer in two parts.

First with respect to the

23

legislative history, to be sure the Appellees and their

24

amici have brought forward a number of examples of State

25

court judges, principally southern State court judges,
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

doing some pretty despicable stuff, and I'm not here to

2

defend that.

3

at issue here, whether Congress was in enacting section

4

5, was clued into this question and it had reason to

5

think that State Court exercises of judicial review

6

would give rise to the sorts of problems that section 5

7

was designed to inhibit, there simply is nothing to

8

support that suggestion.

9

But with respect to the specific question

Section 5, of course, was intended to do

10

something very specific.

11

to catch government conduct that the more traditional

12

remedies in place at the time under the '57, '60 and '64

13

Civil Rights Acts, what we would today I think call a

14

section 2 suit, couldn't get.

15

addition to the Danforth that at some deep

16

jurisprudential level courts don't change law, the more

17

important practical point is that courts exercising

18

judicial review are institutionally incapable of

19

changing the law specifically in the way that Congress

20

was concerned about when it enacted Section 5.

21

Congress --

22

It was designed to prevent or

And the point here, in

Why in the world did you say that?

It says

quite clearly the standard has to be different from that

in force or effect on November 1st, '64.

10

At that point

these people were appointed.

11

MR. NEWSOM:

That's right, Your Honor.

12

There are two sort of different things going on here.

13

One, as a matter again of the Appellees' burden to show

14

you that these decisions are clearly included within the

15

text, quite clearly they are not, because November 1,

16

1964, as Your Honor quite correctly points out --

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, in your reply

18

brief on page 8 you say you take no position on that

19

question.

20

MR. NEWSOM:

With respect, what I say at

21

page 8 of the reply is that there is no need for this

22

Court to determine specifically how the November 1,

23

1964, language ought to operate in the legislative and

24

administrative change scenario.

25

and again in Young versus Fordice has suggested in dicta

This Court in Presley

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that perhaps the baseline might float, notwithstanding

2

the November 1, 1964 --

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, there wouldn't

4

be a different baseline for judicial changes than there

5

would be for legislative or executive changes, would

6

there?

7

MR. NEWSOM:

No.

You're -- I think you're

8

right, Your Honor, perhaps not.

9

the burden point that I was trying to make earlier.

10

-- the sole purpose in citing the November 1, 1964,

11

language is to show that at the very least, to the

12

extent you're looking for some clear indication that

13

Congress intended to get these decisions, the text

14

cannot provide that clear indication.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

And this again goes to
My

Well, I take it it's your

16

position -- and I noticed this in the question put to

17

you by Justice Breyer -- tell me if this is wrong, but

18

that it's not just the fact that the court makes a

19

decision, because the court may have discretion to

20

choose plan one, plan two, plan three, but it is if the

21

court makes a decision to show that the prior practice

22

was invalid, was void under State law.

23

MR. NEWSOM:

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

That's right, Your Honor.
That's the distinction, I

take it.
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. NEWSOM:

That's right, Your Honor.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Not the fact that it's

3

just the court, but the kind of decision the court

4

makes.

5

MR. NEWSOM:

That's right.

There are

6

different lines the court might choose to draw.

This

7

case at most presents a question where a court is

8

exercising the power of judicial review to invalidate a

9

previously precleared statute.

It might decide the case

10

more narrowly, as I said, under Young versus Fordice, on

11

a more fact-specific basis.

12

Court would need to decide in this case is that the

13

State court exercises a judicial review to invalidate

14

previously precleared practices as compliant with

15

section 5 do not give rise to section 5 changes.

16

But at the very most, the

And, Chief Justice Roberts, just to get back

17

to the textual piece of this, we have, pointed, in

18

addition to the "in force or effect" language, which we

19

think -- which we think requires judgment for the

20

Governor on Young versus Fordice grounds and the

21

November 1, 1964, language, we have also pointed to the

22

provision in section 5 that we have referred to as the

23

savings clause, which I think provides good reason at

24

the very least to think that Congress was thinking about

25

court decisions enjoining existing baselines differently
25
Alderson Reporting Company

1

from the way it was thinking about the typical

2

legislative and administrative changes that have been

the grist of this Court's section 5 jurisprudence.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Newsom, before you

finish I would like to ask you a question about what

6

action Governor Riley would take if you're right on the

7

law?

8

can't invalidate a law that the Supreme Court says on

9

judicial review of -- on review of the circuit court,

10
11

That is, a mistake by the Alabama Circuit Court

that the circuit court got it wrong.
The first time around, when Jones was

12

elected and then the Governor mooted any controversy by

13

just appointing him.

14

We have somebody who has won an election overwhelmingly

15

against the person that the Governor appointed.

16

are, what, five months left in the term?

18

fact oust the person who was a four-to-one 1 winner in a

19

popular election and install the person who was a loser

20

22

not so thwart the will of the people?

Now we have a similar situation.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

Thank you,

MS. KARLAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

of the question of whether the law was in force or

effect.

This is the language from this

Alderson Reporting Company

And it starts
"The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

practice was never in force or effect."

2

We agree.

And then the Court goes on to say:

"A

3

State, after all, might maintain in effect for many

4

years a plan that technically or in one respect or

5

another violated some provision of State law," citing

6

Perkins against Matthews and City of Lockhart against

7

United States.

8
9

All that Young against Fordice does is
explain that that case is a sport that deviates from the

10

general rule that this Court has had that when a law is

11

in force or effect its constitutionality under State law

12

doesn't matter.

13

I'd also like to direct the Court's

14

attention to page 114 of the joint appendix, where Act

15

85-237's text appears, and direct you to the bottom of

16

the page in section 4, which says:

law," which it did in June of '85 when the State

20

obtained preclearance.

1

law has different views, for example, on ripeness and

2

the like than Article III does.

3

the question that Justice Ginsburg asked at the very end

4

of the argument about the remedy in this case, because

5

Alabama law here is quite peculiar.

6

our brief there have been two opinions by the Alabama

7

Supreme Court, in a case called Roper against Rhodes and

8

a case called Wood against Booth, that reiterated under

9

Alabama law once an election has been held, if no

And this also goes to

And since we filed

10

contest litigation was timely brought, the fact that the

11

person is unentitled to remain in office does not allow

12

contest after the fact.

13

So we have a peculiar problem in this case,

14

which is, even if this Court were to reverse, there was

15

an election held here pursuant to Alabama Act 2006-342

16

that was conceivably valid under Alabama law.

17

question whether to replace Merceria Ludgood who won

18

that election, as you noted, by a four-to-one margin,

19

with either Juan Chastang or somebody else is quite up

20

in the air.

21
22
23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the

Why didn't the Alabama

Supreme Court say that in this very case?
MS. KARLAN:

Well, in this case, the

24

25

the Alabama Supreme Court in the Riley decision here

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then it was the district

5

judge that made Alabama go to the preclearance after the

6

second --

7

MS. KARLAN:

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

Yes, that's correct.
But still, if you take

this case at its essence, a circuit court got Alabama

10

law wrong and that's what you say counts as to make the

11

law operative.

12

The law becomes operative because an Alabama

13

intermediate court or trial court made a wrong decision

14

about Alabama law; and then when the supreme court

15

corrects it, that doesn't count.

16

your position, that they're locked, Alabama is locked

into a mistake that was made about Alabama law by that

circuit court.

United States still compel the result of finding that

2

this law went into effect as a matter of Federal law,

because the question of whether a law is in force or

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, you're saying that if

they cannot make a change without obtaining

a clear, bright-line rule.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It simply says

May I ask:

It's

You're not --

8

correct me if I'm wrong.

I didn't think you were

9

arguing that because of the preclearance followed by the

10

State determination of unconstitutionality, that the

11

State was required to follow that unconstitution law.

12

I thought your argument simply was that, in

13

effect, there was a stalemate at that point, and the

14

State was going to have to come up with some new law

15

that would be precleared.

16

MS. KARLAN:

Am I correct?
It's a little trickier than

17

that, Justice Souter, for the following reason.

18

give you a hypothetical that will --

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Let me

For the reason that, absent

20

their coming up with a new law, what law would be in

21

effect?

22
23
24
25

MS. KARLAN:

That's what I was about to

explain.
JUSTICE SOUTER:
no law would be in effect?

And isn't the answer that
I mean, you're in the same

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

situation then that you would be in if there had been no

2

judicial litigation going on, the law had been brought

3

to the Justice Department or the D.C. court, had --

4

preclearance had been refused.

5

didn't have the old law because it had been repealed.

6

It couldn't apply the new law because it wasn't

7

precleared, and somebody in Alabama would have to do

8

something.

9
10

The State at that point

Aren't we in essentially the same position
here?

11

MS. KARLAN:

Well, we are, but as I

12

suggested, it's a little trickier than that.

13

of course, the existing practice is for purposes of

14

section 5 the law that's in force or effect.

15

example, suppose you had a State that --

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

17

Because,

So, for

Well, it was in force and

effect.

18

MS. KARLAN:

Excuse me?

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Does the theory require

20

that we assume it remains in force and effect by virtue

21

of the preclearance even when there is a subsequent

22

determination of unconstitutionality?

23

MS. KARLAN:

I think the answer to that

24

question, candidly, is yes, and the State can cure that

25

quite quickly.

But let me explain it with a
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

hypothetical that might make this clearer, which is:

2

Suppose you had a State in which people were voting in

3

an election, and then the State supreme court held that

4

that part of the county had never been properly annexed.

5

The State would be required to continue letting those

6

people vote in the election unless and until it received

7

preclearance from the Department of Justice.

8

what Perkins against Matthews and City of Lockhart

9

require.

That's

So the State has to, once it adopts a

10
11

practice, continue using that practice unless and until

12

it receives preclearance for a new practice or -- and

13

this is somewhat --

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm not sure that in those

15

cases you had what you had here, which was a

16

declaration, let's assume, of invalidity ab initio.

17

Let me give you this hypothetical.

A county

18

council goes to the board of commissioners or the board

19

of supervisors of the local county or legislative branch

20

and says:

21

a lot of laws, and one of the laws it passed is that

mistake; that law was never passed; it was never signed

by the governor.

MS. KARLAN:

What result?

Well, in your hypothetical

4

there would be no problem at all, and this goes back to

5

Justice Souter's hypothetical that he asked Mr. Newsom,

which is:

it's never in force or effect as a baseline.

talking about, but I can't tell from the Fordice opinion

19

-- there was a ward system that was in fact in force or

20

effect.

21

in effect.

22

people might have taken action under it.

23

But I don't know how long that ward system was
It might have been for a long time, and

And the same thing is true in City of

24

Lockhart.

I can't tell.

25

they are saying:

You may know.

But my point is

Here we have a middle case, and what
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

we want is to use enough sense to say, look, it wasn't

2

really in effect.

3

could.

4

or a lot of people believed it.

5

did something to make up for it.

People challenged it the minute they

They -- everybody knew it was unconstitutional,
And the Governor then

6

If you're going to say that that little bit

7

counts as putting it in force and effect, you know what

8

we're going to have?

9

municipality all over the country that doesn't always

10

know what the rules are, and they pass something, and

11

people challenge it immediately, it's obviously wrong,

12

and they're stuck with it as a matter of Federal law.

13

That's going to be a mess.

14
15
16

We're going to have every

They're saying something like that, so I'd
like to hear your response.
MS. KARLAN:

Well, there are two factual

17

points in response to your question, Justice Breyer.

18

The first is, with respect to Perkins against Matthews,

19

the Mississippi statute that required the use of

20

at-large rather than district elections was passed in

21

1962 and used precisely once before the preclearance, so

22

it was on all fours with this case.

23

lag between the unconstitutionality of the City of

24

Canton's practice and the preclearance.

25

to ask what does our case look most like that this Court
37
Alderson Reporting Company

It was a three-year

So if we were

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

has already decided, it would be Perkins.

2

The second point which I want to direct the

3

Court to is we are not actually talking in this case --

4

and this goes as well to the Court's judicial function

5

-- about just Act 85-237.

6

case about Act 2004-215, which was the attempt by the

7

Alabama Legislature to revise the constitutionality of

8

Act 85-237.

9

was a provision of the Alabama Constitution, Section

We are also talking in this

Because the central problem in this case

10

105, that said you couldn't pass local legislation

11

unless the act -- unless the general act made that very

12

clear.

13

So in 2004 the Alabama legislature thought

14

it had solved the entire problem here by amending the

15

section of chapter 11 of the Alabama election law to say

16

unless a local law provides otherwise you can use

17

gubernatorial appointment.

18

revive Act 85-237.

19

things, our clients were the sponsors of the act, among

20

the sponsors of the act.

That law was intended to

We know this because, among other

21

Now, the Alabama legislature --

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

If I could just ask you, in

23

making that argument, aren't you asking us to say that

24

the purpose of this act -- that the intent of the

25

Alabama legislature in passing that act is different
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

from the intent as determined by the Alabama Supreme

2

Court?

3

MS. KARLAN:

Yes, but if I can explain why I

4

think this is important in a sense.

5

claim of the State is that this is a case about

6

fundamental constitutional provisions of Alabama law,

7

but in fact in its current guise, which is whether the

8

2004 Act revived the 1985 Act, this is purely a matter

9

of statutory construction and what the Alabama Supreme

It's because the

10

Court said is:

11

make this law retroactive; we think they meant to make

12

it only prospective.

13

talking about fundamental Marbury against Madison

14

judicial review of the kind that the --

15

We don't think the legislature meant to

But that's not the same thing as

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's a review of a lower

16

court by a higher court.

17

They review for correctness, and the Alabama Supreme

18

Court said the circuit court got it wrong.

19

misconstrued the law, and we are correcting that.

20

that's -- that's correct.

21

MS. KARLAN:

That's what higher courts do.

It
And

That is correct, Justice

22

Ginsburg, which leads to the second pair of cases that

23

we think this Court has already decided that provide you

24

absolutely clear guidance as to why preclearance was

25

required here.

And that's this Court's decision in
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Hathorn against Lovorn and this Court's decision in

2

Branch against Smith.

3

In both of those cases as well, you had the

4

question, quite acutely in Hathorn against Lovorn, of

5

whether or not the chancery court in Mississippi, which

6

is a trial-level court, got the law right or wrong on

7

whether elections should be conducted in a particular

8

way in Warren County.

9

said they got it wrong.

The Mississippi Supreme Court

But this Court said that decision and the

10
11

implementation require preclearance because the presence

12

of a court decree doesn't exempt a contested change from

13

section 5.

14

So in this case, had Governor Riley decided

15

completely by himself that he, having taken an oath to

16

support the Alabama constitution, could not in good

17

conscience let a special election go forward here, it

18

would be no different from having the Alabama Supreme

19

Court decide that.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What does the Alabama

21

Supreme Court preclear?

Where it was redistricting and

22

it had a redistricting plan, I can see it would send

23

over to the attorney general the new redistricting plan.

MS. KARLAN:

Exactly what was submitted

after the Federal court did, which is the -- the

5

decision to appoint rather than to elect someone to

6

7

Supreme Court didn't have to submit anything, and the

8

Federal court could not have been clearer in this case.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The Alabama

The Federal court told

the Alabama --

11

MS. KARLAN:

No, it told --

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It told Alabama.

I

13

thought -- I thought that one of the reasons was

adjudication wasn't complete when the district court

15

made its first ruling, so the district court said, now,

16

go off and get those two Alabama Supreme Court decisions

17

precleared.

19

MS. KARLAN:

No, Your Honor.

That's not

what they said.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

MS. KARLAN:

What did they say?

If you turn to the August 18th

22

final judgment, which is on page 9a over to page 10a of

23

the jurisdictional statement, they said judgment is

24

entered in our favor -- that was the declaratory

25

judgment -- and then said the State of Alabama has 90
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

days to obtain preclearance.
The State was free to come to the DDC and

3

seek judicial preclearance if they wanted.

4

was free, as Justice Scalia suggested, to try and use

5

the quick way.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The State

But the State's position

7

was it shouldn't have to preclear a decision of the

8

State's highest court --

9
10
11
12

MS. KARLAN:

But it -- it --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- saying that the State

lower court got it wrong.
MS. KARLAN:

Justice Ginsburg, this does not

13

say the State has to preclear the decision of the

14

Alabama Supreme Court.

15

look at page 8a, which is the end of the district

16

court's opinion -- you know, it's enjoining enforcement

17

of those decisions; it's not enjoining those decisions.

18

You don't have to spin the Alabama Supreme Court here.

19

But they literally sued only the governor in this case.

20

It simply says -- and if you

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why did Alabama have

21

to preclear anything?

On November 1st, 1964, this was

22

an appointed position.

This is not a change from what

23

was, quote, "in force or effect" on November 1st, 1964.

decisions are all dicta.

3

MS. KARLAN:

But let me go then straight to

a factual point, which is this is not the same practice

5

as they were using on November 1st of 1964, because that

6

practice was a combination of two things.

membership elections or at-large elections.
MS. KARLAN:

So something else

changed --

12

14

It was

It's a huge difference, Your

Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The argument you

made in your brief was that this was already decided in

19

Reno versus Bossier Parish.

I didn't see the --

20

MS. KARLAN:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

this was not, in fact, a change in your brief?

23

MS. KARLAN:

No, we didn't -Is the argument that

We didn't see that until their

24

Alderson Reporting Company

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.

They had the

argument -- you at least thought they did --

3

MS. KARLAN:

No.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You quote in your

5

brief Reno versus Bossier Parish and one other case.

6

I'm thinking of one other.

7
8
9

MS. KARLAN:

I think you're probably

thinking about Young against Fordice, itself.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.

And you raised

10

the argument -- you criticized them for raising this

11

argument; that this wasn't any different; but you did

12

not say that it wasn't any different.

13

MS. KARLAN:

Well, their claim there was

14

that -- not that this wasn't any different, but part of

15

our explanation is that, in context, we think there is a

16

difference between what was going on in 1964.

17

They actually, I think, want to go back to

18

the 1977 to 1985 practice, which is the post -- the

19

post-election practice in Alabama once Brown against

20

Moore had been decided.

21

Now, the other thing is I will say that the

22

Department of Justice regulations on this, which are

23

quite clear, have been in effect since 1987.

24

2006 -- in the 2006 re-enactment of the Voting Rights

25

Act, if you look at the House report, they talk about
45
Alderson Reporting Company

And in the

Official - Subject to Final Review

Young against Fordice there.

2

"Mississippi's attempt to revive and to resuscitate" --

3

and those are the House's words, "to revive or

4

resuscitate" -- the --

5

And they say

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think you're quite

6

right on the DOJ regulations and the House report, but I

7

just don't see how that squares with the statutory

8

language.

9

MS. KARLAN:

Well, Your Honor, if I could

10

just make an observation about section 5 more generally

11

in Allen, and I'll start here.

12

Court recognized that the text of section 5 doesn't

13

provide for private rights of action, and yet it found

14

them.

In Allen, itself, this

It recognized that the text of section 14 of

15
16

the Voting Rights Act suggests that the only place that

17

can be -- that the only place that can litigate section

18

5 --

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So because we've

20

ignored the text in other areas, we should just forget

21

about it here?

22

MS. KARLAN:

No, because that's -- that's

23

the -- those sets of decisions by this Court have been

24

ratified by Congress and have been the longstanding

25

practice under section 5.

You should continue that.
46

Alderson Reporting Company

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought that --

2

they ratified -- these cases were ratified by Congress,

3

but Congress did not change the language in the statute.

4

MS. KARLAN:

Because it thought that the

5

purpose of section 5 -- if I could spend just one

6

sentence on this -- the purpose of section 5's November

7

1st language was to prevent a sort of game of

8

Whac-A-Mole in which the States would keep changing the

9

practice.

And the idea of that freeze was to hold it in

10

place so that it could be challenged as a constitutional

11

matter before the State switched again.

SUPPORTING THE APPELLEES
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
As this Court has repeatedly recognized,
section 5 of the Voting Rights Act requires a cover
47
Alderson Reporting Company

jurisdiction to seek preclearance whenever it seeks to

administer any change in its voting practices.

there is no basis in either text or policy for carving

Do you have any problem

with the republican form of government provision of the

9

10

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Absolutely not.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

As I understand what's

12

going on here, the -- the legislative process of the

13

people of Alabama, whereby something is invalid as a

14

law, suddenly becomes a law because the Federal attorney

15

general has given it preclearance.

16

never voted for that properly under their Constitution.

17

Yet, it becomes law in Alabama.

18

form of government?

19

MR. SHANMUGAM:

The people have

And that's a republican

Well, I don't think, with

20

respect, Justice Scalia, that that's actually happened

22

of special elections actually went into effect while the

23

litigation was ongoing.

24
25

What happened in this case was that the practice

The Alabama Supreme Court then held that the
statute adopting that practice was invalid as a matter
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of State law, to be sure, and, therefore, was void ab

2

initio as a matter of State law.

3

As a result of that decision, the remedy in

4

some sense was to revert to the practice of

5

gubernatorial appointments.

6

that it was then incumbent on the attorney general under

7

section 5, the Alabama attorney general, to seek

8

preclearance of that practice.

9

general made the determination that it would be

10
11
12
13
14

And what happened then was

And the Federal attorney

retrogressive to go back to that practice.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

From an Alabama law that

had never been adopted by the people of Alabama?
MR. SHANMUGAM:

It had been adopted by the

people of Alabama.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Not validated, so -It was invalid, to be sure,

17

as a matter of State law.

And then -- and then what

18

happens at that point is that the Alabama attorney

19

general is in very much the same position as he would be

20

if the Federal attorney general had held that some

21

statutory provision that had been enacted by the Alabama

22

legislature was improperly retrogressive.

Suppose the

That's exactly right, and

10

under our view there would not have been a change,

11

because it was the fact that there was a special

12

election that was critical.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So there becomes -- there

14

becomes a change only because the circuit court has made

15

the mistake about what the State law is.

16

odd.

17

MR. SHANMUGAM:

That's very

There becomes a change,

Justice Ginsburg, because the practice of special

elections actually went into effect by virtue, at a

minimum of the fact that an election was held.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And to

What if the district

court -- circuit court I guess it is in Alabama.

This

action is filed before the election and the circuit

court says:

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

I'm not going to disrupt the election, there isn't time;

2

so this election can go forward and during that period

3

I'll be considering the law.

4

or three-judge district courts do, saying we're going to

5

look at this question, but we don't have time to stop

6

the election so it's going to go forward.

7

would that lead to the same result?

8

MR. SHANMUGAM:

We do that all the time,

In that case,

Well, with respect,

9

Mr. Chief Justice, I think what a State court might do

10

in that circumstance would be to enter a stay until it

11

could adjudicate the validity --

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, sure, but not

13

always.

14

something, even if they think it's a serious claim, they

15

sometimes say:

16

forward because we're going to look at this and perhaps

17

the State Supreme Court has to look at it, and we don't

18

want to hold up the election.

19

You know, if it's a week before the election or

We're going to allow the election to go

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, it is certainly the

20

implication of our position that if the law actually

21

goes into effect and an election is held and if

22

preclearance has already been granted for, in some

23

sense, the contrary position, then, yes, if the State

24

Supreme Court or the State trial court subsequently

25

gives State law a different interpretation, then that
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

change is going to require preclearance.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

3

implication.

4

That's not just an

That's your whole theory.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, it is our theory as to

5

what the "in force or effect" requirement means.

6

believe that that follows from this Court's decision in

7

Young versus Fordice, which sets out the parameters for

8

determining --

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

And we

Well, Young versus Fordice,

10

that's Young versus -- I mean, if it never went into

11

force and effect, of course we don't reach questions

12

like republican form of government or 1964 safe harbors

And so I think it's an important matter.

You know, some people

So it wasn't in force and

When I looked at Perkins v. Matthews, that

20

was not a case where the law was challenged immediately.

21

Rather, what Justice Brennan said is that this has been

22

in effect from 1962 to 1965 at least, and in 1965 they

23

had an election under the ward system.

24

might have been unconstitutional or it was, it was still

as it possibly could be, where in fact, as Justice

enforcement of the civil rights laws of the United

11

States if the holding of this Court were, well, under

12

these circumstances, where challenged immediately, et

13

cetera, it never took force and effect?

14

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Justice Breyer, the harm is

15

that there would be actual retrogression.

16

that there are two critical and distinct legal issues

17

that this Court needs to address.

18

this practice was in effect for long enough for it to

19

have been in force or effect.

20

on that issue is Young versus Fordice.

21

And I think

The first is whether

The governing precedent

There is not simply the partial implementation of voter

25

that is not sufficient to satisfy the "in force or

submit that the City of Lockhart and Perkins answer that

question because in both of those case the Court held

7

that the relevant question was whether the practice was

8

actually in effect.

9

And we do respectfully

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, you talk

10

about force and effect.

11

"force or effect on November 1st, 1964."

12

anything to add to Ms. Karlan's response on my quaint

13

fixation on the language of the statute?

14

Of course, the statute says

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Do you have

Well, it isn't quaint at

15

all.

I would say that I do think that as a textual

16

matter one could perhaps make the argument that where a

17

covered jurisdiction changes its voting practice after

18

the statutory coverage date and then enacts basically a

19

new version of the pre-existing practice, that the new

20

practice could as a formal matter be said to be a new

21

practice.

22

But I want to make two additional points.

23

The first is that the question of whether the statute

24

covers reversion to coverage date practices is really

25

not properly before the Court.

Appellant seemingly did

54

not raise it before the district court and it is not --

4

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, that can't tie

Well, it's not within the

5

scope of the question presented, either.

6

presented focuses solely on the question of whether

7

changes precipitated by State court decisions require

8

preclearance.

9

answered twice in Hathorn and Branch.

10

The question

And that's a question that this Court has

The only other thing that I would say is

11

that it has been not only the consistent interpretation

12

of the attorney general, but also the consistent

13

interpretation as far as we are aware of the lower

14

court, that the statute does reach reversions to

15

preexisting practices as well.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I don't see how --

17

regardless of how consistent the interpretation is, how

18

can you read "November 1st, 1964," to mean anything

19

other than that date?

20

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I do think that a

21

textual argument could be made, Mr. Chief Justice, that

22

the practice that was in effect as of the coverage date

23

in some sense ceases to exist when the jurisdiction

24

adopts an intervening distinct practice.

25

there is enough ambiguity, I believe, to get us into the
55
Alderson Reporting Company

And certainly

realm of deference, and this Court has repeatedly

2

recognized that the attorney general's interpretations

3

of section 5 are entitled to substantial deference.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Shanmugan, what does

5

the attorney general do when he gets -- I mean, does he

just preclear any old thing that somebody shoves under

his nose?

16

incumbent on covered jurisdictions when they seek

17

preclearance clearly to identify the relevant change in

18

their voting practices when they come to the attorney

19

general for preclearance.

20

submitted for preclearance, there was nary a word in the

21

Alabama attorney general's submission that there was any

22

potential difficulty with the statute under State law.

23

And this Court has a line of

And when the 1985 act was

And so, the attorney general precluded on

24

the understandable understanding that the statute simply

affected a shift to special elections.
56
Alderson Reporting Company

And I do think

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that the great price of Appellant's interpretation is if

2

the court were to adopt it, it would suddenly shift the

3

burden to the Federal attorney general or the D.C.

District Court to when they receive a preclearance

submission, essentially assess the meaning and validity

6

of any State statute, lest the State statute be

construed differently by a State court, and thus, lock

in the preclearance court or attorney general.

believe that that problem along with this Court's

decision in Branch and Hawthorne support our

interpretation.

2

doesn't strike me that the underlying method of how the

5

The rule is by virtue of these decisions gubernatorial

It

If I may, just a couple of housekeeping
items.
Justice Ginsburg, the question of what DOJ

10

was asked to preclear here is crystal clear from the

11

district court's opinion.

12

three-judge court held that two Alabama Supreme Court

13

decisions Stokes v. Noonan and Riley v. Kennedy must be

14

precleared before they can be -- so the notion that the

15

State was not asked to preclear judicial decisions is

16

simply incorrect.

17

On August 18, 2006, this

The second thing I'd like to mention just

18

briefly is that the Federalism exacerbation here exists

19

in a very real way for this reason.

20

legislative and litigation history of section 5 has been

21

about legislative and administrative change.

22

respect to those sorts of changes, this Court has said

23

most recently and most forcefully in Presley that that

24

application of section 5 even there works an

25

extraordinary change of the traditional course of
59
Alderson Reporting Company

The entire

Even with

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

relations between the states and the Federal Government.

2

So the -- to this point to be sure the Court has been

3

willing to accept that extraordinary departure.

4

question in this case, however, is whether this

5

extraordinary departure ought to become this

6

extraordinary departure to account for this new

7

category, this new universe of changes.

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why as a matter of

Federalism is it more extraordinary to review a court

determination than the determination of a popularly

MR. NEWSOM:

13

pieces of this, really.

14

simply in a quantitative sense.

15

lot more changes, so in sheer numbers we have got an

16

exacerbation.

17

Well, Your Honor, there are two
That's more extraordinary
We are talking about a

But it's also in a qualitative sense the

18

sense that we are living in a post Marbury, post Cooper

19

versus Aaron, post Bernie world in which State courts

20

just like Federal courts are tasked with finally

21

deciding what State law means.

22

real difference, I think, in upsetting the considered

23

judgment of a State court with respect to what State

24

court -- with respect to what State law means than there

25

is --

And so, there is a very

60
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But they are not saying

2

State law is different from what it means.

3

saying that you cannot put a change in effect until you

4

get it precleared.

5

MR. NEWSOM:

Right, Your Honor.

They are

But with

6

respect I think that that doesn't do justice to the

7

functional reality of what's going on here.

8

Alabama Supreme Court says, may I, says in Stokes versus

9

Noonan that 85-237 is and always was unconstitutional.

In 1988 the

10

We have an issue of doctrine that's simply part of

11

Alabama law and, again, I don't think anybody here

12

seriously disputes that 85-237 was unconstitutional.

13

And 20 years later DOJ steps in and refuses

14

to bless that determination, and to be sure, is not

15

meddling around in the intricacies of state law but the

16

functional equivalent is the same.

17

judgment aside, and notwithstanding the Stokes court

18

invalidation of that, DOJ says very clearly in its

19

objection letters that 85-237, despite its invalidation,

20

remains in full force and effect.
