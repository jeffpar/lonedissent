Mr. Phillips.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

In this case two very sophisticated parties

12

agreed to arbitrate an ongoing dispute that was pending

13

in litigation before the United States District Court

14

for the District of Oregon.

15

plainly that after an arbitration award is issued the

16

district court -- and this is at Pet. App. 16A -- "shall

17

vacate, modify, or correct any award where the

18

arbitrator's conclusions of law are erroneous."

19

Ultimately what this Court must decide is whether there

20

is anything in either the Federal Arbitration Act or any

21

other Federal law that renders this non-adhesive,

22

unambiguous contract agreement unenforceable.

23

Their agreement states

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Phillips, would you

24

say the same thing if the agreement provided for de novo

25

review in the district court?
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

I would be more concerned

2

about identifying a standard of review for the district

3

court than identifying a standard for modifying the

4

arbitration award pursuant to the agreement.

5

that's a different issue.

6

dealing with a judicial function than this is, which is

7

simply implementing the intent of the parties as to what

8

the standard ought to be for enforcing an initial award.

9

So I think

I think that's closer to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That would be -- I am

10

assuming that the parties wrote that standard into their

11

contract, so to the extent you're relying on party

12

autonomy why couldn't the parties elect whatever

13

standard of review they wish?

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

Justice Ginsburg, I recognize

15

that there is a limit to party autonomy.

16

ought to be a very strong preference for party autonomy,

17

and I'm not saying that if I were here and I had an

18

agreement by which de novo review is the standard I

19

wouldn't defend that autonomy.

20

recognize that there are limitations on autonomy that

21

recognize the functions of the Judiciary.

22

limitation isn't remotely implicated in this particular

23

case.

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think there

All I'm saying is that I

But that

Well, in some -- one of

the functions of a judicial -- what about an agreement,
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

arbitration agreement, that the district court can find

2

facts de novo?

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

That one I think worries me

4

less because it doesn't -- it doesn't suggest -- I mean

5

it just says that we will leave to the district, to the

6

district court the findings, and essentially renders the

7

arbitration agreement -

8
9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, suppose it's a

complex matter of monitoring emissions, looking at water

10

quality, and the arbitrator has to sit by the river for

11

a month, the district judge had to go down and sit by

12

the river for a month.

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

But again, the parties under

14

those circumstances it seems to me are perfectly free to

15

decide whether they want those issues to be decided

16

conclusively by the arbitrator or to have them

17

adjudicated at the end of the day by the Federal court.

18

And so, if they choose to go through the arbitral

19

process, and then still say nevertheless that's

20

nonbinding and that the district court's free to

21

evaluate that on a de novo record, that it seems to me

22

doesn't in fact implicate the judicial function in quite

23

the same way that the standard of review does.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Indeed, are there not such

things as nonbinding arbitration's?
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Precisely, Justice Scalia.
Which in effect say that

3

when we're done the district court will do it as an

4

original matter.

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

And in that context

6

you're not raising the same problem that you're

7

referring to, Justice Ginsburg, because you're not

8

saying anything about the standard of review.

9

just simply saying that the court ought to decide the

10

You're

legal issues.

11

Now, I do think that when the parties agree

12

that it's a question of law that the question of law is

13

for the district court to decide.

14

the district court in fact will use de novo review, but

15

the parties are not dictating that.

16

that's left -- I'm sorry.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

My assumption is that

That's a matter

Doesn't the arbitration

18

agreement in this case set out a standard of review and

19

say on findings of fact they have to be supported by

20

substantial evidence?

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

They do, but that issue -

22

that standard of review is not at issue in this

23

particular case.

24

not there has been an error of law committed, and

25

obviously the district court found that there was a

The only question here is whether or

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

clear error of law committed.

Indeed, the dissenting

2

judge below said it was an irrational decision on the

3

law.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Phillips -

But they were both -

6

they were both in this agreement, both the substantial

7

evidence rule and the standard of review of legal error.

8

So are you saying that you -- we don't have to deal with

9

that question or you're not going to defend it, because

10

the standard was dual.

11

--

12

Am I not right about what they

MR. PHILLIPS:

No.

There are, there are

13

clearly two different standards that are set out in the

14

arbitration agreement and one of them is substantial

15

evidence.

16

to the district court there was no issue presented by

17

Hall Street on the question of substantial evidence.

18

didn't challenge any of the factual findings by the -

19

by the arbitrator, and therefore that issue is not

20

presented.

21

I'm saying is I don't have to defend it in this

22

particular case because the only issue here is whether

23

there has been an error of law.

24
25

But when the matter went from the arbitrator

I'm not saying I wouldn't defend it.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
standard.

We

All

But you have to give us a

You said, you mentioned, oh, functions of the
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

district court.

I don't know the standard you're

2

proposing that will allow us to draw the line and to put

3

cases on one side of the line or the other.

4

well, you can't interfere with the functions of the

5

court.

You said,

I don't quite understand that.

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, the problem there -

7

and again, I think this is largely a fanciful concern

8

because I don't think serious parties who are engaged in

9

arbitration agreements are likely to come up with

10

standards that are completely alien to the judicial

11

process, and indeed there's no empirical evidence to

12

support that.

13

and our amici didn't cite anything like that.

14

Certainly Respondent didn't cite anything

But to be sure, Judge Kozinski in his

15

concurring opinion in the original panel decision in

16

Kyocera said he would have a very different reaction to

17

this case if we were talking about the district court

18

either flipping a coin or looking at the entrails of

19

dead birds as the basis for decision.

20

point is we're not embracing that extreme approach.

21

mean, we recognize party autonomy as a significant part

22

of what Section 2 of the Arbitration Act is all about

23

and we think that ought to drive the analysis of this

24

Court significantly, particularly in how you interpret

25

Section 9.

Mr. Phillips, why do

4

the district court must confirm it if certain criteria

5

are met -- I assume you have a normally enforceable

6

contract that the district court can enforce just like

7

it enforces any other contract.

8
9

If this is not enforceable under the Federal

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's absolutely true,

particularly in this context, Mr. Chief Justice, because

10

here we have a situation where we were before the

11

district court, this arrangement came out of the

12

mediation process, the district court reviewed it,

blessed it, sent it to the arbitrator -

what we would ask this Court to be doing here.

No, you're asking us

20

to bring it under the Federal Arbitration Act and say

that the district court must confirm it despite the fact

that you've changed the standards under Section 9 to 11.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Both the underlying lease

agreement and the arbitration agreement.

can't enter a final judgment in this case, and the

7

reason is -

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

10

It was the

But my point -

-- because of the Federal

Arbitration Act.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

My point is that if

12

you have an ordinary contract action the district court

13

will, because your contract provides a particular

14

standard of review, enforce that.

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

16

true.

17

here.

18

Right.

Right?
No, that's absolutely

But that's exactly what we're asking you to do

JUSTICE BREYER:

On that point -- the reason

19

I think you're -- there's a little chaos here is because

20

you said -- your question is phrased, does the FAA

21

preclude enforcement of your arbitration agreement?

22

you're going to say:

23

doesn't preclude it.

And

We answer that question, no, it

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

It doesn't require it; it

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

doesn't preclude it.

2

But then would we have to go back and say

3

what is the source?

There has to be some source of law

4

that authorizes this contractual agreement, and there

5

could be two possible sources.

6

is it clear that in fact either of these two sources

7

does?

And my question here is,

8

The first source is State law.

I gather the

9

difficulty is that the State of Oregon has an act just

10

like the Federal Arbitration Act, so we'd have to ask

11

the Oregon courts:

12

Oregon State law.

13

Is this a legitimate contract under

The alternative source of law is the Federal

14

judge's case management authority.

15

statute which clearly gives the judge some kind of

16

authority, but not for your case because your case

17

exceeds the jurisdictional amount.

18

absence of that statute, is there inherent authority in

19

the district judge?

20
21

And there we have a

Therefore, in the

Now, I don't know the answer to either of
those questions.

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

I thought that -

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

My temptation is to say

24

they're open questions and they'd have to be argued on

25

remand, which makes this case the case of the century, I
12

guess, in a certain respect.

I was just looking for the

case of the day, Your Honor, actually.

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

certain area.

8
9
10

It's quite a difficult

All right.

Well, in a

I overstate.

But the -- is there any light you can shed
on those two questions, or is there some third possible
source of law?

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, we know that -- I think

12

the answer to that is that Section 2 of the Federal

13

Arbitration Act, which this Court has recognized

14

repeatedly has a very strong preference for enforcing

15

the agreement of the parties, is a part of the answer to

16

that.

17

Story, back as early as 1814, said that as a matter of

18

common law that the notion of restricted arbitration is

19

a matter completely left to the parties.

And you couple that with the fact that Justice

20

So I think that there are general common law

21

standards.

Now, you know, could Oregon law have gone

22

the other way on that?

24

never argued that this is unenforceable as a matter of

25

Oregon law.

Maybe.

I think it would be an
But the Respondent has

So I don't think that issue is in this
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

case.

2

As a matter of case management, if the Court

3

wants to defer to anything then it ought to refer to the

4

district court's own assessment that this agreement

5

should be utterly enforceable, that -

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Have you ever argued that

7

this is a matter governed by Oregon law and it is

8

enforceable?

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

They never -

Have you ever argued that?
That it is enforceable?
Yes, under Oregon law.

Have you ever argued Oregon law?

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, we've never argued -

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

No?
-- Oregon law.
Well, then it's not

18

surprising they haven't argued that Oregon law doesn't

19

apply.

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, no.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But they have in

22

fact.

On page 43 of their brief, they say that if you

23

prevail the parties would be left to a State law

24

contract action to determine the enforceability of the

25

award.
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, but the State law

2

contract action that they're talking about is precisely

3

the State law contract action we brought in this case

4

before the Federal district court under diversity

5

jurisdiction.

6

asking for is for the Court to enforce -

And at the end of the day what we're

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9
10

No, no.

I -

-- the district judge's

determination CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.

Their citation

11

is to an arbitration treatise.

12

referring to is the contract to arbitrate.

13

I'm mistaken, what you want is for the district court to

14

be able to enforce your agreement under the Federal

15

Arbitration Act.

16
17
18

The contract they're
And, unless

Right?

MR. PHILLIPS:

Because it falls squarely

within the Federal Arbitration Act.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it doesn't

19

fall squarely within it because the Federal Arbitration

20

Act sets different standards of review.

21

saying is I don't see what the big deal is because you

22

-- okay, don't use the Federal Arbitration Act, which

23

gives you kind of an express remedy the district court

24

must confirm.

25

district court:

And all I'm

Use normal contract law and say to the
Well, you don't have the Federal
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Arbitration Act, you don't have to confirm it as a

2

judgment, but we have a contract, it's perfectly valid,

3

it sets a different standard of review, you should

4

enforce it.

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

But I think the

6

answer to that is that if Congress had a choice as

7

between those alternatives, Congress clearly in Section

8

9 made it absolutely indisputable that there's a simple

9

way to enforce it, but it didn't suggest the

10

alternative, which is that you relegate it to some kind

11

of State law, completely complicated process to try and

12

get this arbitration award enforced under those

13

circumstances.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

I'm just not

15

following this discussion.

Does it assume that you can

16

bring an action on the contract and just bypass the

17

provision of the contract which says there will be

18

arbitration?

19

assert you can do that?

How can you do that?

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24
25

You -- you don't

No, we clearly can't do that.
You clearly can't do that.
Right.
So somebody has to decide

on this arbitration provision.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

And I think the

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Court, this Court is the court that's got to decide that

2

at this point and -

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The arbitration

4

provision, the arbitration agreement is just a contract.

5

Right?

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

To be sure.
Well, then I don't

understand why it's not enforceable as a contract.

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

10

that, Mr. Chief Justice.

11

12

I don't think we disagree on
I think the -- I think that's

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, if it's

13

enforceable -- I'm obviously missing something here.

14

it's enforceable as a contract, what is the great

15

benefit you get out of prevailing and saying this should

16

be enforced under the Federal Arbitration Act?

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

If

Well, the benefit is the

18

efficiency that the Federal Arbitration Act is trying to

19

promote.

20

potentially be any number of routes you might want to

21

identify.

22

care about what happens on the back end, where they say,

23

once you get your -- you have your -- you get your

24

arbitration award and then you go off and you do Section

25

9 and we don't have any agreement on that.

I mean, to be sure, there -- there could

The clearest one is where the parties don't

17
Alderson Reporting Company

And that one

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is easy, and that's the most efficient.

2

Then the question is what do you do in a

3

situation where the parties don't agree with that, where

4

they want the district court to review it.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What do you do if

6

you have a contract, an arbitration agreement that's not

7

covered by Section 2, it's not concerning a maritime

8

transaction or involving commerce?

9
10

MR. PHILLIPS:

Those are regulated by State

law.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

Okay.

Purely by State law.

But

13

this is the contract that falls within Section 2, Mr.

14

Chief Justice.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But this -- but this one

16

isn't, and if we say that you lose under the Federal

17

Arbitration Act, is it open to the State court to say,

18

well, that's what the Federal Arbitration Act says, but

19

we handle arbitration differently?

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, that's sort of the core

21

question I think that sort of comes out of Southland

22

and -

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think if you lose on the

24

arbitration here, you've got to lose on the arbitration

25

before State court.

admit that.

I mean you don't have to

That's MR. PHILLIPS:

That's the logic of

Southland, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why in the -- why is

8

that the case?

I mean, this doesn't purport to occupy

9

the field of arbitration and to preempt State law.

It

10

provides that a very direct order -- the district court

11

must confirm the arbitration award as a judgment -

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- if you fall

14

within the criteria.

15

okay, I don't have to confirm it as a judgment.

16

And all I'm saying is they'll say,

MR. PHILLIPS:

But I think the answer to the

17

conundrum you've raised, Mr. Chief Justice, is that if

18

you're not in Section 9, then you ought to be in Section

19

2, and there you should do precisely what the contract

20

says, which is that you should vacate or set aside the

21

arbitration agreement -

in Section 2, and the State court can't invalidate your

But you want to be under Section 9, and

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, I -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- that the district

court must confirm the arbitration award if it meets

9

certain standards.

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, I don't need Section 9.

11

All I need is Section 2 because if -- because under our

12

agreement, what we specifically say is that the district

13

court shall vacate, modify, or correct.

for them to correct this award by saying that the right

Number one, the plain

Number two, an argument that that plain

language, as a matter of historical fact, was

deliberately chosen when Congress made a choice between

two different, basic arbitration schemes.

And they chose the arbitration scheme that,

in effect, does not allow the -- the kind of variation

restrictive, and you can't do that.

the parties reach a different agreement.

not say it for the simple reason that it says

Alderson Reporting Company

of all, it would seem to me less likely that that's

2

true, given the common law history that comes out of

3

Justice Story's opinion, which said restrictive

4

arbitrations are common.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All right.

But you're -

6

you're ignoring -- when you say that, you're ignoring

7

the development of arbitration in the period after

8

Justice Story; and you are ignoring the argument that

9

the other side makes that a deliberate choice was made

10

between two generally understood arbitration, statutory

11

arbitration, schemes, and they choose -- they chose the

12

one that is inconsistent with your position.

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

Justice Souter, there are two

14

-- there are two questions there, so let me try to

15

answer both of your questions.

16

The first one is:

What does the plain

17

meaning of the statute say?

18

statute, which is at 1a of the appendix to the petition,

19

is the parties in their agreement agreed that a judgment

20

of the court shall be entered upon the award.

21

agreed to that, so the plain language of Section 9

22

simply doesn't get you there.

23
24
25

The plain meaning of the

We never

Section 9 envisions that this is a -- that
this is an understanding.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then how can you get any

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

award enforced, even subject to your terms?

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

Because under Section 2 the

3

parties have -- have provided a mechanism for that by

4

saying that the district court will correct an award if

5

it's erroneous as a matter of law.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then you have to grapple

7

with the question whether in fact under Section 2 you

8

can provide for confirmation in a manner consistent with

9

the provision for confirmation under Section 9.

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

But all I'm saying is

11

that Section 9 doesn't apply in this particular context,

12

and, therefore, it makes all the sense in the world to

13

--

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You simply -- I -- I don't

15

-- maybe I'm missing something, but you seem to stand

16

there and just say baldly:

17

doesn't apply, you've repeated that several times.

18

I at least don't know why it doesn't apply.

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

Section 9 doesn't apply.

It
And

Well, hopefully I can

20

persuade you by rereading the portion of the statute,

21

that the first sentence of Section 9, which is at

22

Appendix 1:

"If the parties" -

23

Section 9:

Where is it?

Where is it?

1a of the appendix to the

"If the parties in their

agreement have agreed that a judgment of the court shall

2

be entered upon the award" -

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

Uh-huh.

These parties didn't agree

5

that a judgment would be entered on the award.

6

agreed that a judgment would be entered on the basis of

7

whether there was a non-erroneous declaration of law by

8

the arbitrator.

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

They

And what you are

10

arguing is:

At this point, even though we didn't agree

11

within the meaning of the preamble to the first sentence

--

MR. PHILLIPS:

Correct.

-- we still have a right to

-- because we agreed to it

under Section 2.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Both parties agreed to it

under Section 2.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

And the question, I think,

22

is when you argue in that fashion:

23

under Section 2 to provide for confirmation and

24

enforcement under terms which are inconsistent with the

25

provision in Section 9.

Do you have a right

2

And I think that's the -- that's the
question you've got to answer.

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, if you -- if you want

4

to make a judgment call and you think there's really a

5

judgment you have to make as between Section 2 and

6

Section 9, then it seems to me that all of the Court's

7

decisions have recognized that the single most important

8

objective of the Federal Arbitration Act is embodied in

9

Section 2, which is -- which is to enforce the intent of

10

the parties -

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

13
14

The -- the cases -- is you way you should come

out.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

The intent of the parties

15

that's being enforced in those myriad cases is the

16

intent of the parties to arbitrate.

17

of those cases respond to the -- to the issue that we've

18

got before us.

19

I don't believe any

And the issue we've got before us as you are

20

now framing it is this:

If you do not have a provision

within the meaning of the first sentence of Section 9 -

that question simply to say there are lots of cases

saying that the intent of the parties to arbitrate

16

should be enforced.

This is a more specific question.

20

of the parties.

That's why we've got this

case here.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, to be sure.

But the

7

bottom line here -- and -- and I do want to answer the

8

Illinois v. New York part of this, because I think

9

that's a complete red herring in this case.

10

But it still seems to me that if you think

11

that there is an ambiguity with respect to Section 9,

12

first you should resolve that ambiguity by construing it

13

to implement the parties' intent, because that is the

14

overriding objection to the FAA.

answer the red herring.

Then -- then I'll tell you what

22

I think about Section 10.

all the -- first of all, there's nothing in the

24

legislative history that suggests that Congress made

25

some kind of conscious choice between New York and

On the red herring, all -

Illinois.
They talk about the New York model.

There

3

is not a word in the legislative history about Illinois.

4

So I don't think that's what the decision was.

5

But even if that were the choice they made,

6

that still doesn't go to the question of what do you do

7

if the parties reach a different agreement.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That is, indeed, the issue.

What we're arguing about here is whether 9 and 10 are

10

simply default rules that apply where the parties have

11

not otherwise specified.

12

arguably, what the New York law and the Illinois -- I -

13

I don't know that any of those cases cited by the other

14

side involved cases where the Illinois rule or the New

15

York rule was applied in the teeth of an arbitration

16

agreement that said something differently.

17
18
19

That's -- and that's,

MR. PHILLIPS:

No.

None of -- None of those

cases fall in that category.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

In other words, I think

20

both the Illinois rule and the New York rule were

21

default rules.

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

this is the default rule?

10 and 11 don't read like default -

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think the important

4

part about Section 10 to keep in mind is -- is their

5

argument also is predicated on the assumption that

6

Section 10 exhaustively lists all of the grounds for

7

modifying an -- vacating an arbitration award.

8

is absolutely clear from this Court's decisions both in

Wilko and in W.R. Grace that the list in Section 10 is

But what the Wilko Court held was:

customer, if they went to arbitration, was also waiving

Your Honor, this is under

The only way it would not be under Section 9

is if they had won on the severability argument.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't understand that.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We thought Miss Brinkmann, can we

back up a bit, because this agreement had an usual

18

genesis.

19

in the court a piece of it.

20

agreed that another piece of it would best be resolved

21

in arbitration.

So the judge was in equal participation

22

in that effort.

All three parties wanted to get a

23

particular issue resolved through an arbitrator rather

24

than the court, itself.

25

This was a big case, and the judge kept right
And then he and the parties

And I doubt very much whether the judge

Alderson Reporting Company

1

would have been at all interested in that scheme if he

2

thought he were doing an idle thing.

3

having agreed to just what the judge thought was a nice

4

way to resolve this issue, would then find themselves

5

out of Federal court and have to bring some kind of suit

6

in State court.

That the parties,

It doesn't seem to fit this scenario.

MS. BRINKMANN:

Two responses, at least to

8

that, Your Honor:

Then the parties should have asked

9

the court to appoint a special master.

That maintains

10

under the authority of the district court judge.

11

not what happened here.

12

And that's important.

What is before the Court here is the Section

13

9 action to confirm the judgment.

And that's what comes

Yes, Your Honor, that's

right.
JUSTICE BREYER:

That's why just what you

21

said is actually what's worrying me about the case.

22

Because what Justice Ginsburg said makes me think that

23

there could be situations, a lot of situations, where

24

Federal judges do want to peel the case off.

say send it to a master.

And you

idea.

3

I have no

And are we going to have to hold in this

4

case whether a judge or when a judge, a Federal judge,

5

does or does not have authority to do such a thing?

6

That's why I say -- I was actually thinking

7

the case of the century, because it's going to take a

8

hundred years to finish.

9

But the fact is there are those issues there

10

once we say Section 9 doesn't apply.

11

to have to say -- suppose we were to say it's just State

12

law.

13

of this kind of contract?

14

the authority -- of the inherent authority, not

15

statutory, of a Federal district judge to peel off bits

16

of cases and decide them in different ways.

17

Then you're going

Well, suppose the State doesn't allow enforcement
Then we have the question of

I don't know the answer to those questions,

18

but I think they are quite important.

19

MS. BRINKMANN:

So what do I do?

Well, first of all, Your

20

Honor, if it comes to a question about the particular

21

facts in this case involving the scenario that Justice

22

Ginsburg put forth of the very unusual situation of a

23

Federal district court being there, we would, of course,

24

dismiss the writ as improperly granted.

25

broader implication, I think 40
Alderson Reporting Company

That has no

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, no, because there is a

2

holding in the whole Ninth Circuit, which accounts for a

3

large percent of the country, that the district judge

4

can't do this.

5

in that circuit, and we ought to review that.

6

And that's quite a significant holding

MS. BRINKMANN:

That would be the question,

7

Your Honor, if when faced with something that a judge

8

wants to peel off, you have to look at what tools a

9

Federal judge has been given.

Magistrate judges widely

10

used for all types of picking juries, discovery, special

11

masters, those are the tools that have been given to

12

Federal judges.

13

When arbitration -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why not use -- why not

judge can work out what they think is the most efficient

way to resolve this controversy?

this arrangement one issue that they are going to peel

off to go to an arbitrator, but the judge is going to

So they decide at the

that if the judge controlled this arbitrator, somehow

that would violate Article III.

You are arguing that this non-Article

essentially little more than a rubber stamp on what the

10

the sense of that doesn't come across to me.

that's why this streamlined process under Section 9 to

transfer that award, that contractual agreement -

It is their

That's what an arbitration award is, and

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but the question is

19

whether or not that streamlined process is the only

process.

Arbitration Act is to promote confidence in the

22

arbitration process, that if parties agree to have the

23

double assurance that the arbitrator hasn't made some

24

strange ruling of law, that that's quite consistent with

25

the whole purposes of arbitration.

It seems to me that if the purpose of the

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MS. BRINKMANN:

Well, Your Honor, we are not

2

suggesting that it's the only means to get an award

3

enforced, but if you are doing the Section 9 route, the

4

grounds in the statute are the only grounds on which

5

that can be done, and the policy about whether or not

6

those transaction costs, when parties want further

7

review on an arbitration, is shifted to the courts.

8

It's one Congress made -

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you're -- you're

10

asking us to interpret the statute; and let us assume

11

that it's a plausible interpretation and interpret the

12

statute as the Petitioner would.

13

Section 8, the parties can use the authority of the

14

court to libel a ship.

15

authority to -- to use very intrusive means, and to say

16

that the parties can't ensure, if they choose, to have

17

review for correct errors of law -- to correct errors of

law when the ship has been seized, it seems to me to

19

promote the whole purposes of the act.

20

MS. BRINKMANN:

You know, under

The court is extending its

But, Your Honor, I think

21

that's where we get to -- between when we are talking

22

about Section 2 and the purpose is that the parties

23

control how the arbitration progresses.

24

the entry of the judgment by a court, and that's what

25

Congress controls; and the grounds in 10 and 11 cannot

Then we come to

be perceived as default rules.

3

inconsistent with the Petitioner's position and the

6

basic policies of the act.

confidence in the arbitration process by ensuring this

added level of review, it seems to me quite consistent

with the purposes of the act.

MS. BRINKMANN:

Well, two things, Your

Honor.

14

Section 9, and then they have what Chief Justice Roberts

15

was talking about, a -- a state contract action -

16

If they want to do that, then they don't choose

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Can I interrupt on that

17

for just a minute?

18

Justice's line of questioning was assuming there's an

19

adequate state remedy available for enforcing this

20

contract, but the whole premise of the statute at the

21

time it was enacted was that there was not a state

22

remedy, because there was a bias against arbitration.

23

And this was thought to be the sole remedy for

24

arbitration at the time the statute was enacted.

25

You're assuming and the Chief

MS. BRINKMANN:

Your Honor, that actually
44

Alderson Reporting Company

2

history, because I think that what happens in

3

Petitioner's reply brief, there's some confusion between

4

common-law causes of action to enforce an arbitration

5

award as a contract, and actions under statutes.

6

of the commentators confuse that also.

7

I'd like to address the

Some

There was an opportunity to have judicial

8

review of the law through a contract enforcement case,

9

although there was a clear statement requirement.

So

10

there are going to be cases that talk about, that are

11

not under the statue.

12

the statute, you have to differentiate between the cases

13

under the New York model statutes, where you will not

14

find that, and cases under the Illinois statute, where

15

you will, because they allow judicial review.

Then when you look at cases under

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

MS. BRINKMANN:

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Are there any -

Now, when Justice Scalia Are there any -- are

19

there any such States left today that are using the

20

Illinois model?

21

MS. BRINKMANN:

I believe not, Your Honor.

22

We explain in one of our footnotes that that came into

23

disfavor.

24
25

But I want to address Justice Scalia's point
about the legislative history.

There is no case that we

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have found that says, notwithstanding those statutory

2

grounds, you can contract beyond them, but we do have

3

not only the New York cases, but also in footnote 8, I

believe, on page 30, several other statutes have

5

statutory grounds, and repeatedly they say these are the

statutory grounds.

action where you could have a full jury trial.

9

That is separate from the common-law

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But -- but the old Illinois

and the old New York rules, you don't have any cases

10

which say -- which establish that those rules were not

11

just default rules, but you -- but you were not allowed

12

to depart from them.

13
14

17

MS. BRINKMANN:

We think the language in

those cases will speak -JUSTICE SCALIA:

You don't -- you don't have

any case that holds that?
MS. BRINKMANN:

the statutory grounds, where they do say it.

anything else that's --

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do they go

You don't have any case

that holds that.
MS. BRINKMANN:

No.

No.

There's none on

the other side, either.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there a possibility

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that the reason the language in the statute is as it

2

is -- when was the Federal Arbitration Act; what year

3

was it?

4

MS. BRINKMANN:

1925.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And there was still

6

abroad in the land considerable distrust of arbitrators.

7

Judges said arbitrators are stepping on our turf, and so

8

they would be naturally resistant to let the arbitrator

9

go ahead and have the most minimal review in court.

10

Maybe the act was written the way it was to say, if the

11

parties want to go to arbitration, courts, you stay out

12

of it.

13

MS. BRINKMANN:

If you choose that -- yes,

14

Your Honor.

15

the court to stay out of it only if you agree that

16

you're going to come under for confirmation.

17

let the parties have the review through common law if

18

they want it.

19

And even one more step.

But we will tell

It's still

That's absolutely correct, Your Honor.

And

20

I think it's that additional step, though, that puts the

21

whole picture together.

22

there is appellate arbitration that takes care all of

23

the policy concerns about whether or not -

24
25

And I do want to emphasize,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Would you -- would you

agree that what we hold in this case applies to suits in
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

admiralty, where you don't go to State court under

2

Section 8?

3

MS. BRINKMANN:

That's a difficult question,

4

Your Honor.

5

the arbitration cases did come up from admiralty, and I

6

think the answer is, if it is an action under Section 9

7

to confirm, it must be confirmed unless there is

8

vacatur, modification, or correction under 10 or 11.

9

Those are exclusive grounds.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

11

I have looked at many of the old -- some of

Well, at this point you

don't have a State court fallback for your argument.

12

MS. BRINKMANN:

Well -

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I -- I can't say why

14

it isn't -- I just repeat my earlier point -- quite

15

consistent with encouraging confidence in admiralty

16

arbitration to allow district courts to review rulings

17

on a matter of law if the parties so choose.

18

MS. BRINKMANN:

I think that question,

19

though, perhaps goes to more or not whether the Section

20

9 is the exclusive means for enforcing an award, and it

21

isn't.

22

beyond my expertise.

23

So perhaps there is some other means that is

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, if there is, then let's

24

think -- suppose that in the middle of a trial, the

25

parties say, judge, this is so complicated factually, we
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have a way that we can get an agreed statement of facts.

2

They walk out the door; they have a friend who has a

3

sign called arbitrator; and they come away from that

4

friend with an agreed statement of facts, which they

5

agree to submit to the judge to apply the law.

6

there is nothing wrong with that, I imagine.

7
8

MS. BRINKMANN:
to be changed.

9

Now,

Well, that sign would have

It would have to say -

JUSTICE BREYER:

We know -- I'm sorry.

I'm

10

not even going to tell the judge how I find this.

11

to a crystal ball; I go to any way I want.

12

in with an agreed statement of facts, and is there

13

anything, if we have that agreed statement of facts,

14

that would will stop the judge from saying I take this

15

agreed statement of facts; there's a difference about

16

how the law applies to it; I will resolve this case?

17
18

MS. BRINKMANN:
things.

that.

bound by that.

2

It's not a mandatory standard.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm sorry.

I thought that,

3

if in fact parties come in with an agreed statement of

4

fact in a case, I've never seen a situation where the

5

judge couldn't say, fine, I agree; that's the -- the

The Article III judge maintained that

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm trying to

6

What they agreed to is an agreed statement

7

of facts, subject to Section 9 standards, Section 9 and

8

10.

9
10

MS. BRINKMANN:
it's an award -

11
12

JUSTICE BREYER:

What I'm driving at,

whether I've asked it well or not -

13

MS. BRINKMANN:

Yes, right.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- is is how is it any

15

different from coming in with an agreed statement of

16

facts?

17

MS. BRINKMANN:

Because this is an

18

arbitration award.

19

the award gives -- imposes a legal obligation on someone

20

else, and that award is going to be entered as a

21

judgment of the court, against the parties.

22

It is a contractual agreement where

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask this sort of

23

basic question?

Forgetting the text for a minute, what

24

policy reason -- can you think of why would Congress

25

want to prohibit this particular form of agreement?
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MS. BRINKMANN:

Congress wanted to give

2

parties an option for a quick, simple, cost-effective

3

and final way -

4
5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Why would they want to

prohibit an option that takes a little bit longer?

6

MS. BRINKMANN:

Because that would be a

7

different action where you have to look to State

8

contract law, contract law defenses, whether there are

9

State arbitration laws -- it's a different animal.

They

10

were looking at the animal of an arbitration agreement

11

and a streamlined method to have that enforced and

12

that's what Sections 9, 10, and 11 do.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought your

14

answer would be part the point Justice Stevens brought

15

up earlier.

16

arbitration agreements at all -

There was this State hostility to enforcing

17

MS. BRINKMANN:

Uh-huh.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And so what the

19

Federal Arbitration Act says is, all right, in the

20

narrow circumstances where the parties agreed, subject

21

to this narrow standard, you have to enforce it.

22

that doesn't mean we are going to override the State law

23

across the board.

24
25

MS. BRINKMANN:

That's right.

But

It gives the

parties the option for choosing that, and if you choose
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that, you have to do what Congress says.

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Why do they want to

3

prevent the parties from choosing the option they chose

4

in this case?

5

want to do that.

6

I don't think that answer says why they'd

MS. BRINKMANN:

They can choose another

7

option, but they may have a full-blown trial about

8

contract law in the award, and that's what Section 9

would -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay, why didn't Congress

Justice made, and it played through my mind, is maybe

the -- what seemed to be the plain language limits in

choice.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

We will, in effect -- we

13

will say:

Look, you got to enforce these contracts,

14

arbitration contracts, but you don't have to go one step

15

further.

16

any indication that that was the case and that's the

17

explanation for this limit?

Maybe that was the political deal.

18

MS. BRINKMANN:

Is there

With all respect, I think

19

not.

I think that the Section 2 and 3, the enforcement

20

of the arbitration agreement, is about the private

21

parties determining the process.

And I have to say Petitioner's argument is

5

so broad, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, there were

6

questions of fact in this.

7

litigating under this agreement also in the district

court, and we brought a question of fact to the district

We were -- we were

When the district court first sent this back to

the arbitrator, it went through and basically told the

looked at these facts.

And it sent it back to show the arbitrator's work.

You know, you haven't looked at these

I believe it's Pet. App. 57a.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I

JUSTICE BREYER:

Has that been a nightmare

-- has it been the nightmare you suggest in labor

arbitration?

23

outside the act, doesn't it?

Because I think labor arbitration falls

24

MS. BRINKMANN:

It does.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

And has that turned into

some kind of terrible nightmare where there are dozens

2

of rules and they have a long complicated labor set of

MS. BRINKMANN:

There has not been

24

widespread use of this provision.

I think that our

25

amici briefs really speak to this, Your Honor, because
57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the difference would be a statement by the U.S. Supreme

2

Court that says parties can now create whatever other

3

grounds they want and go in through Section 9 in a

4

streamlined process and are going to impose on Federal

5

courts, not appellate arbitrators, on Federal courts,

6

whatever grounds they want -- de novo review of fact, no

7

harmless error, perhaps create different appellate

8

standards when it goes up.

9

And I think that the amici really point out

10

that that is so contrary to the finality and

11

efficiencies that the animal of arbitration -

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think a lot of those

13

horribles, Mr. Phillips would agree with you because he

14

hesitated even on de novo, and I think he thought that

15

trying to control an appeal from the district court,

16

that would be out of the ballpark.

17

MS. BRINKMANN:

I think it would create a

18

hybrid animal that is not what the Arbitration Act is

19

about.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why couldn't you limit it

21

reasonably by saying the parties can agree to anything?

22

We would only have to say at least, the parties can at

23

least agree to anything that the court would be able to

24

do if this had been brought as an action in the court,

25

rather than initially as an arbitration.

MS. BRINKMANN:

No, but you're putting -

you are, I think, as this Court itself has said, you're

breeding litigation from a statute whose whole point was

to minimize and limit litigation.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I'll try to give you back some of that time before I'm

done.

8
9

In my experience in evaluating cases like
this, it seems to me that in some ways where you end up

10

depends in large measure on where you start.

11

parties fundamentally disagree about whether or not this

12

is an agreement that should be -- you know, who's got

13

the burden?

14

authorized by something or are we entitled to have this

15

agreement and it's their burden to demonstrate clearly

16

that Congress meant not to allow this to be enforced?

17

And it seems to me clear that the answer to that is that

18

it's their burden to find something specific in the

19

Federal Arbitration Act or otherwise that precludes

20

this.

21

And the

Do we have to show that this agreement is

Section 9 doesn't get them there because

Section 9 is predicated always on an agreement of the

parties in the first instance, and so that's not a basis

24

for doing that, but even if you thought Section -

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What do you say about her

62
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

argument that we are limited in considering your

2

argument by the severability ruling that you didn't

3

appeal?

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

I don't see how the

5

severability ruling has any relevance to this particular

6

problem, because what we're saying is we are entitled to

7

enforce the -- the agreement of the parties with respect

8

to exactly what the district court has the authority to

9

do.

The fact that it -- whether it's severable or not

10

severable doesn't mean that we're not entitled to the

11

enforcement of the agreement as written by the parties.

12

Severability doesn't eliminate our right to have that

13

part of the agreement -

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but it does -- it does

15

preclude -- I mean, her answer is an answer to the

16

argument that you were making in response to a question

17

of mine earlier, that in fact you don't have an

18

agreement within the meaning of the preamble portion of

19

Section 9.

20

severance and you didn't appeal severability.

21

She says you do because you have one after

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, but all I'm saying is

22

that I think that puts the cart before the horse.

23

Remember, severability only comes up after the court of

24

appeals had decided that this provision in the contract

25

was unenforceable.

And then the question is, is there
63
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

any part -- you know, is the entire arbitration set

2

aside.

3

And what I'm saying is that initial decision

4

is wrong.

5

severability.

6

it's their burden to show something in the Federal

7

Arbitration Act that's, that precludes enforcement of

8

this provision.

9

Section 10 wouldn't get you there because it's not -

10
11

14

And the reason why it's wrong is because

Section 9 doesn't get you there.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Remind me why Section 9

doesn't get you there -- because of the "if" clause.

12
13

And, therefore, you don't have to worry about

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

Because of the "if"

clause.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

If the parties in their

15

agreement have agreed that a judgment of a court shall

16

be entered upon the award made pursuant to -- but they

17

have agreed to that, haven't they?

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well no -

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

The question is simply Subject to the condition that

21

the district court would make a determination that there

22

was no error in law.

23

know, they had -- I mean -

24
25

And that -- I mean, that's -- you

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why is, why is that

condition excluded from the "if" clause, but all of the
64
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

other conditions that are set forth in 10 are not

2

excluded from the "if" clause?

3

the "if" clause must embrace any conditions.

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

I mean, it seems to me

Right.

But the point is if,

5

if all you do is agree to an arbitration, then Section 9

6

and Section 10 apply directly.

7

arbitration that is subject to legal error or review,

8

okay, then the "if" clause doesn't prevent you from

9

being allowed to have that portion enforced, Your Honor.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

But if you agree to an

Well, if you agree on

11

condition and the conditions are satisfied, are you

12

saying that the district court must enforce under

13

Section 9, or are you saying that enforcement would be

14

under some other authority?

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think the enforcement would

16

be under the existing authority that the district court

17

had in this particular case, because this was a case

18

that was pending before the district court under

19

diversity jurisdiction seeking to enforce the lease

agreement.

And so the question is, is that judgment of

65
Alderson Reporting Company

And our answer

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to that is no.

There is nothing in the Federal

2

Arbitration Act that prevents the district judge from

3

doing precisely what it did.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm not sure why you have

5

to give the answer you just gave to Justice Alito, if

6

what you told Justice Scalia is correct, that the "if"

7

clause includes the condition that the court reviewed

8

for issues -- for errors of law.

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

I'm not sure there is any

10

inconsistency between those two things, between those

11

two things -- statements.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well -- but you're arguing

13

to Justice Scalia that Section 9 works because you could

14

interpret the "if" clause that way.

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Now you're telling Justice

17

Scalia, oh, well, it's a different action.

18

the action here anyway.

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

20

is that we can win on either theory.

21

Right.

We have got

Well, all I'm saying

My whole point here has been Section 9

22

doesn't prevent us from being able to do this.

Section

23

10 is not an exhaustive list and, therefore, we are

allowed to add to Section 10.

And at the end of the

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Section 2, consistent with the intent of the parties to

2

ensure that we get what we want.

3

The one point I did want to make about how

4

all of this operates is, you know, in the relationship

5

between the courts and arbitrators, it seems to there is

6

probably no more important issue than who decides

7

whether something is arbitratable.

8

held quite clearly in First Options that even though the
