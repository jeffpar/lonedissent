ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

9
10

MR. FARR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Although the 1905 Compact between Delaware

12

and New Jersey did not settle the boundary dispute

13

between them, New Jersey nevertheless agreed to dismiss

14

the suit that it had filed before this Court to

15

determine the boundary.

16

seemingly contradictory facts, I think, is because the

17

Compact did resolve permanently certain issues of

18

jurisdiction, implementing rules that could be

19

administered without regard to where the boundary was.

20

And the reason for those two

Thus in particular Article VII, the

21

provision of the Compact that's particularly at issue in

22

this case, provided that each State could continue to

23

exercise its traditional riparian authority over the

24

riparian owners on its side of the river according to

25

its laws.

Now, the Special Master I think fundamentally
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

changed the nature of the Compact by superimposing the

2

boundary line into the terms of an agreement that was

3

meant to operate without it.

4

because he mistakenly applied the presumption that all

5

promises with respect to jurisdiction and territory must

6

be unmistakable; and this Court, however, had said

7

several years before, in Virginia versus Maryland, that

8

that presumption simply is not applicable to compacts

9

that are entered into when the boundaries between the

10

And I think he did so

States are disputed.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Farr, one of the

12

striking things about this Compact is that to the extent

13

that it is definite, there is a lot in here in detail

14

about service arrests on the river and about fishing,

15

but then you get to these two articles at the end and

16

they certainly don't have that same definite detailed

17

quality.

18

stressing, it says -- let's see -- "may continue to

19

exercise."

20

just whatever was the status quo, that will continue;

21

not to do anything dispositive, just whatever was will

22

continue.

23

As I read the Article VII that you're

So it seems to me that "may continue to" was

MR. FARR:

Well, several things about that,

24

Justice Ginsburg.

First of all I think that the

25

language "continue to" necessarily brings in the
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

historical antecedents of regulation of riparian matters

2

by both States.

3

New Jersey's side of the river, that is with respect to

4

riparian owners on the New Jersey side, New Jersey had

5

exercised full and exclusive authority over, for

6

example, wharfing out to navigable water, the building

7

of piers and wharfs to do that, the granting of lands,

8

without any involvement whatsoever by Delaware.

9

It's undisputed in this case that on

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Was it clear that New

10

Jersey believed when it had authorized somebody to wharf

11

out, that the person who wharfed out was not subject to

12

New Jersey's environmental laws?

13

MR. FARR:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

MR. FARR:
anything --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

MR. FARR:

21

The history doesn't show

The history doesn't show

18

20

I think what --

anything about that?

16
17

No.

So if --

-- specific about that kind of

law.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- if it -- if it would

22

have been subject to New Jersey's environmental laws,

23

had New Jersey owned the bed of the river into which the

24

wharf was extended, by parity of reasoning it seems to

25

me the wharf would be subject to Delaware's
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

environmental laws if Delaware owns the bed of the

2

river.

3

MR. FARR:

I think without the Compact that

4

would be true, but I think what the Compact is saying is

5

that you get to retain the degree of power on your own

6

side of the river that you had before, without regard

7

ultimately to where the boundary is determined to be.

8
9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So your -- your argument --

it seems to me it's not that easy, because your argument

10

is assuming that by virtue of the "may continue"

11

language, the State of New Jersey acquires a new power,

12

and the new power in effect is to -- is to make grants

13

of subaqueous land that belonged not to New Jersey but

14

to Delaware, and that's the stretch.

15

It -- it seems to me that that is such an

16

extraordinary position or proposition, that you've got

17

to have something more specific than "may continue" in

18

order to construe that as meaning an agreement which was

19

intended to give New Jersey the power to grant away

20

Delaware land.

21

MR. FARR:

Well, Justice Souter, I think

22

that the difficulty with that question is it assumes

23

knowledge of where the boundary is.

24

when one talks about New Jersey getting a new power to

25

grant lands that are within Delaware, that is a -- that
6
Alderson Reporting Company

In other words,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is a question that necessarily assumes that the boundary

2

has to be part of that understanding.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't --

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, I'm simply saying that

5

your position --

and I accept your position -- that the

6

Compact is intended to continue to operate whether or

7

not the boundary is -- is ultimately determined, and if

8

so, after it is ultimately determined -- and once we get

9

to that point of continuing to operate after, then

10

necessarily the only way it can operate on your theory

11

is to give New Jersey the power to grant Delaware land.

12

And if New Jersey has that power, it must have been a

13

power that was intended in the 1905 Compact, and that

14

intent strikes me as a very extraordinary intent; and --

15

and my -- the point of my question was the application

16

of the Compact in the new circumstances, as you claim it

17

to be, would be so extraordinary that you ought to have

18

language more specific than "may continue" in order to

19

establish that extraordinary result.

20

MR. FARR:

Well, of course.

It is -- it is

21

saying "may continue to grant riparian rights and lands

22

under its laws."

23

continue."

So it is not simply the language "may

24

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, if you emphasize

25

"under its laws," then don't you lose?
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Because New

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Jersey does not -- I presume New Jersey does not have

2

law, for example, in its constitution, providing that it

3

can grant Delaware land.

4

MR. FARR:

Well, I don't think that the laws

5

have to refer specifically, obviously, to granting

6

Delaware land.

7

beyond the low-water mark in New Jersey.

8

grants before 1905 specifically --

9

It did have provision for granting laws

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Many of the

But I'm going on the

10

assumption that it, in fact, had jurisdiction; that it

11

had land below -- beyond the low-water mark.

12

MR. FARR:

But what I think you're

13

suggesting, Justice Souter, I think, is what -- what

14

fundamentally alters the nature of the Compact is to

15

assume that New Jersey had certain powers up until the

16

time the boundary line was determined, and then it lost

17

those powers after the boundary line was --

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It didn't so much lose -- I

19

mean it had a generalized recognition of power.

20

order to exercise that power, it had to possess certain

21

attributes, i.e., land.

22

In

Once it lost that land, it had nothing to

23

exercise the power over.

In fact, it had a little bit

24

left.

25

low-water marks, so it still had the power.

It had the distance between the high- and the

8
Alderson Reporting Company

But the --

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the recognition of the power in 1905 was, in effect, a

2

formula; and the formula depends on facts to be applied;

3

and the facts changed once the boundary was determined.

4
5
6

MR. FARR:

You see, I think there are two

problems with that, Justice Souter.
First of all, the very notion that there

7

would be something left if the boundary line was

8

determined to be at the low-water mark on the New Jersey

9

side -- in other words, that Article 7 would continue to

10

operate; it would just operate subject to the boundary

11

-- at least in the context of the riparian right that we

12

are talking about, the right to wharf out to navigable

13

water, that right is essentially meaningless if you stop

14

at the low-water mark.

15

In other words, what you're saying and what

16

the Special Master's recommendation essentially does, it

17

says New Jersey has no right to authorize wharfing out

18

to navigable water without Delaware's consent.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

20

MR. FARR:

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

What right do you think --

I -What right do you think New

22

Jersey has now with respect to the subaqueous land?

23

it simply to authorize it to be disturbed to the extent

24

necessary to construct a wharf, or does it go any

25

further than that?
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Is

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. FARR:

Basically, I think what you have

2

said, Justice Alito, is exactly right.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It is --

I have a more basic

4

question.

5

belongs to New Jersey and that New Jersey gives a

6

private individual a right to wharf out into the

7

Delaware, does that individual acquire ownership of the

8

land under the water, assuming New Jersey owns the

9

subaqueous land?

10

Assume -- assuming that the subaqueous land

MR. FARR:

It depends on the form of the

11

grant, but, typically, if New Jersey --

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13
14
15

But, normally, authority to

wharf out doesn't convey the land with it; does it?
MR. FARR:

It conveys an interest in the

land that allows the doing of the activity --

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MR. FARR:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

MR. FARR:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of the wharf.

-- for which the -Of the wharf.

That's correct.
Now, if -- if merely

21

authority to wharf out would not even convey New

22

Jersey's own land, how can you argue that, by reason of

23

this Compact, it implicitly conveyed what is now

24

Delaware's land?

25

MR. FARR:

Well, because Delaware has
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

essentially said in Article VII, we believe, Justice

2

Scalia, that New Jersey may continue to do this.

3

doing -- I mean this land --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It was

May continue to wharf out,

5

but not continue to grant subaqueous land, which you say

6

doesn't go with wharfing out.

7

MR. FARR:

Well, what we are -- what we're

8

talking about, I think, is we're talking about granting

9

the interest in land that is necessary for the riparian

10
11

owner to be able to wharf out.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So that if you have

12

one of these wharves that goes beyond the low-water mark

13

and there are two people at the end of it and one of

14

them shoots the other, would they be prosecuted for

15

murder in Delaware or New Jersey?

16

MR. FARR:

Well, in -- in -- there was a

17

gambling offense at the end of a pier in -- in -- that

18

proceeded from the New Jersey shoreline, in 19 -- in the

19

late 1950's in a case called the Federenco case, which I

20

don't have the cite for immediately.

21

Supreme Court held that that was within the jurisdiction

22

of New Jersey, and Delaware filed a --

23
24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The New Jersey

I suspect the New

Jersey Supreme Court would.
MR. FARR:

Delaware filed a brief, Mr. Chief
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Justice, supporting that position.

2

So -- but if I could return just for a

3

second to Justice Souter's point and Justice Scalia's

4

point, if one thinks for a moment -- we're -- we're

5

trying to, I think, interpret the -- the 1905 Compact as

6

it must have been understood by the commissioners who

7

drafted it.

8

And so I think that, unlike the Special

9

Master, who at the time he's interpreting it, knows

10

where the boundary line is, we have to think about,

11

first of all, would the commissioners essentially have

12

been saying to New Jersey, as your hypothesis would

13

suggest, that each State on its own side of the river

14

has the right to grant riparian rights and lands and

15

exercise riparian jurisdiction subject to the boundary

16

line, which for New Jersey would mean that, in fact, if

17

it lost the boundary case, it would effectively have no

18

riparian jurisdiction at all?

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Farr, what about the

20

article that follows Article VII?

21

"Nothing herein contained shall affect the territorial

22

limits, rights, or jurisdiction of either State in or

23

over the Delaware River."

24

least on every other article.

25

MR. FARR:

Article VIII says:

So that's a qualification at

Well, Justice Ginsburg, if I may
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

say, the quote is longer than that and in a critically

2

important way.

3

herein expressly set forth."

4

It says it may not do that "except as

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, and I don't see

5

anything expressly set forth in VII, which just says

6

"may continue to," which says the status quo is

7

maintained.

8
9

MR. FARR:

Well, I mean, obviously, we're --

we're debating the meaning of Article VII, but it seems

10

to me that Article VII is an express provision herein,

11

meaning in the Compact.

12

aiming at, it seems to me, if we are correct that it is

13

essentially meant to operate without respect to the

14

boundary, would expressly set forth a cession.

15

So that what Article VII is

And I might point out that when this case

16

was before this Court or the two States were before this

17

Court back in 1934, Delaware's counsel before this Court

18

said pretty much exactly what I'm saying this morning:

19

that -- and this is on page 44 of our blue brief, but

20

said that the Compact of 1905 in his view ceded to the

21

State of New Jersey all the right to control the

22

erection of those wharves, meaning wharves that were

23

constructed by New Jersey riparian owners past the

24

low-water mark, and to say who shall erect them.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, are you asking us to

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reject the concept of concurrent jurisdiction in all

2

circumstances?

3

MR. FARR:

As far as State jurisdiction

4

goes, it seems to me there is not concurrent

5

jurisdiction over riparian structures such as piers and

6

wharves and other kinds of acknowledged riparian rights.

7

With respect to matters that are nonriparian, for

8

example, if a riparian owner in New Jersey wanted to

9

construct a hotel that was beyond the low-water mark,

10

that would not be a riparian use.

11
12

And Delaware --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
difference?

How do we split that

I mean let's --

13

MR. FARR:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

decide the difference between those two cases?

16

applicable here, for example, let's say it's perfectly

17

fine for New Jersey to build a wharf out there, but they

18

can't use it for liquified natural gas, which Delaware

19

may conclude poses particular problems that other uses

20

don't.

21

MR. FARR:

Pardon me?
I mean, how do we
And

But I think what you've done, Mr.

22

Chief Justice, if I may, is I think you've detached the

23

purpose of a wharf from the wharf itself.

24

of a wharf is the loading and unloading of goods.

25

That's what -- what they are used for.
14
Alderson Reporting Company

The purpose

Vessels draw up,

2
3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

New Jersey prevent its use for liquified gas?

4
5
6
7

Could New Jersey -- could

MR. FARR:

Under State law, yes, it could,

Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well -- but New Jersey had

given this riparian owner the right to wharf out.

8

MR. FARR:

Well --

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So, obviously, the right to

10

wharf out does not include the right to use the wharf

11

for whatever you like, and the only thing we're arguing

12

about is whether it is New Jersey or Delaware that can

13

impose limitations.

14

limitation is, it seems to me, absolutely clear.

15

But that it is subject to

MR. FARR:

I agree with that.

There's no

16

question that it is subject to limitation.

The question

17

is, whose laws apply?

18

the question that Article VII expressly answered.

19

Article VII again says "each State on its own side of

20

the river" -- which is not a designation that is limited

21

by the boundary, because Delaware made that argument to

22

the Special Master, the Special Master rejected it, and

23

Delaware did not file exceptions in this Court.

24

its own side of the river" I think is properly taken to

25

mean with respect to the riparian owners on its bank of

Who -- and it seems to me that is

15
Alderson Reporting Company

So "on

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the river.

2

-- "each State may continue on its own side of the river

3

to exercise riparian jurisdiction of every kind and

4

nature, make grants of riparian rights and land under

5

the respective laws of the States."

6

Those riparian owners -- I mean, excuse me

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And in your view to what

7

extent does this involve subaqueous lands toward -- and

8

I'll just put "toward" -- the New Jersey side?

9

MR. FARR:

Unfortunately, I'm not sure I

10

understand the phrase "toward the New Jersey side."

11

mean, between the low-water mark --

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I

I'm not sure I understand

13

your position on where New Jersey's jurisdiction begins

14

and ends with reference to subaqueous lands.

15

MR. FARR:

Well, it's -- literal ownership

16

of the land begins at the high-water mark on the New

17

Jersey side and ends at the low-water mark on the New

18

Jersey side, its actual ownership.

19

we believe Delaware has ceded to it the right to grant

20

certain interests in subaqueous land to the extent but

21

only to the extent that they are necessary to allow

22

owners in New Jersey, riparian owners, to exercise

23

riparian rights, provided that the New Jersey State law

24

grants them that right.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Under the Compact,

That suggests --

16
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. FARR:

If they were --

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- it's still an

3

extraordinary power for one State to give up.

4

Delaware -- if that land -- they didn't settle the

5

boundary, but it might be on the Delaware side.

6

Delaware was giving up so much, what did it get in

7

exchange?

8
9

MR. FARR:

If

If

Well, again, the question that

you're asking assumes that the negotiators were coming

10

into the negotiation with their boundary positions fixed

11

and that they were essentially horse-trading within the

12

bounds of the different positions taken by the two

13

States.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

No, I'm not assuming

15

that.

I'm assuming it's unknown, but there is the

16

possibility that it's going to end up --

17

MR. FARR:

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

MR. FARR:

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

that it will end up on the Delaware side.

22

suggesting that Delaware relinquished all of its

23

regulatory authority and gave it to New Jersey, no

24

matter where the boundary turned out to be.

25

MR. FARR:

There's the possibility that --- end up --

I'm sorry.
There's a possibility
And you're

That is what I'm suggesting with
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

respect to this narrow category of riparian rights.

2

Just as that's true, for example, in Article I.

3

Jersey has the right to serve criminal process with

4

respect, for example, to crimes that occur on the

5

eastern half of the river, which is something that New

6

Jersey clearly would not have had if it ultimately lost

7

the boundary dispute; whereas Delaware got, in Article

8

II, the authority to serve process for crimes occurring

9

on the western half of the river, which it would have

New

10

had anyway, whether it won or lost the boundary dispute,

11

assuming that the half of the river refers to the

12

channel.

13

So I mean -- let me -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But that's -- Article I --

14

that's an exception.

And you don't have the benefit of

15

that exception when you're talking about Article VII.

16

MR. FARR:

The exception --

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The exception is not that

18

specific as to the -- as to the extent of the

19

jurisdiction.

20

MR. FARR:

Well, Justice Kennedy, I think

21

you've asked a very good question, but -- but I guess I

22

think it is -- it's quite specific, because the question

23

is, what do the terms "on its own side of the river"

24

mean?

25

here, and indeed in -- before the Special Master,

Those obviously have some geographical impact

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Delaware's position was yes, that is a geographical

2

designation, but what it means is "up to the boundary

3

line."

4

say, the Special Master rejected that position.

5

Delaware did not file exceptions from that position.

6

I think we can accept at this point in the case that's

7

not what "on its own side of the river" means.

8

the question then is:

9

to me what it means is, with respect to the riparian

In other words, up to the low-water mark.

What does it mean?

AS I

So

So

And it seems

10

property owned by New Jersey citizens on the New Jersey

11

side of the river, Delaware citizens on the Delaware

12

there, Justice Stevens, if I can separate them for a

moment.

think the answer to that question is that New Jersey

I should rephrase it.

To

what extent, if any, does Delaware place a limit on the

way in which New Jersey may exercise its riparian

7

rights?

8
9

MR. FARR:

Under State -- by applying

Delaware State law, I think it cannot impose any limits.

riparian rights.

13

Any limit whatsoever?

With respect to the exercise of

Because once it --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Even if -- even if the

14

building of the wharf interfered with the navigation on

15

the river?

16

MR. FARR:

Well, this is, I think, why I was

17

trying to separate it into two parts.

18

out, the part I've left out so far, is Federal law.

19

Federal law has a significant amount to say about what

20

happens with respect to piers and wharves --

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, I'm just asking, is

it --

23

MR. FARR:

24

JUSTICE STEVENS:

25

What I've left

-- in any State.
-- does Delaware law place

any limit on what New Jersey may do in exercising its
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

riparian rights?

2

MR. FARR:

I mean, it does impose a limit,

3

but we don't think those limits are valid under Article

4

VII of the Compact.

5
6

I think the --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I mean, can they validly

impose a limit?

7

MR. FARR:

No, no, they cannot.

They --

what this does is it says, for New Jersey riparian

9

owners, when they are building wharves and piers, they

10

are subject to the laws of New Jersey.

12

the other State, depending on which side of the river

servitude.

Federal law.

"The respective

So they are subject to New Jersey law.

Now,

So that would be subject to review under

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And what about the example

19

of using a -- setting a gambling casino or something at

20

the end of the wharf, well into Delaware territory?

21

You'd say Delaware has no right to object to that.

22
23

MR. FARR:

No, I would say it does have a

right there because that is not a --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

25

MR. FARR:

That's not a riparian use.

That's not a riparian use.
21

Alderson Reporting Company

We're

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Anything involving loading

3

and unloading of ships and so forth would be

permissible?

5

MR. FARR:

Exactly.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Then how come your

7

position in my murder hypothetical was what it was?

8

Because I assume murder is not a riparian use either.

9

And yet, why would Delaware have jurisdiction over a

10
11

casino but not over a crime?
MR. FARR:

Because I think we're talking

12

about now what happens with respect -- I mean, if we're

13

talking -- this was a gambling -- it wasn't a casino.

14

This was a gambling offense that took place on a

15

facility that actually was used for the loading and

16

unloading of ships.

17

activity not relating to the use of the wharf.

18

think the understanding was that riparian jurisdiction

19

of every kind and nature would be sufficient to say,

20

once you have built the wharf and it is a legitimate

21

riparian purpose not subject to Delaware laws, then New

22

Jersey would apply its criminal laws as well.

say, Delaware filed an amicus brief -- unfortunately, we

Why does it

MR. FARR:

might point out.

Alderson Reporting Company

that, if you're going to have riparian rights, you've

got to have the ability to grant some interest in lands

so that they can exercise their right out to the point

where it becomes meaningful.

5

me, why --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's, it seems to

So you say "riparian lands"

7

means the land under the wharf?

8

"riparian lands."

9

MR. FARR:

That's a strange use of

No, that's what -- I mean,

10

"riparian lands" could mean the lands on the bank, but I

11

think that's not what they're talking about in this

12

context.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you know of any other

14

instance where people talk of riparian lands and they

15

mean land extending under the water?

16

MR. FARR:

I think, because of the context

17

here, when it's linked with the rights, that the

18

necessary -- the limitation that Justice Alito mentioned

19

gives -- colors it essentially to say this is what we're

20

talking about.

21
22
23

And after all, this is similar --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's your position, that

"lands" means the lands under the water?
MR. FARR:

That's correct, because this is

settling -- 1 the point of it is to settle and avoid

MR. FARR:

That's true.

Although I might

11

point out that, as the Weggle Declaration says in the

record -- and I can get a citation to that in a moment,

it's in our brief -- that actually is a relatively small

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT

7

MR. FREDERICK:

Justice, and may it please the Court:

8
9

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Our position can be summarized in two words:
Boundaries matter.

Boundaries determine where States

10

can make grants of land, and they determine where a

11

State can exercise its police powers.

12

to both principle, the Special Master got it exactly

13

right.

14

Compact of 1905 precludes the State of New Jersey from

15

exercising its police powers within the boundary

16

determined by this Court in its 1934 boundary decision.

17

And, in fact, at 291 --

18

And with respect

Nothing in Article VII or elsewhere in the

May I just interrupt right

there, Mr. Frederick?

Do you contend that they may no

20

longer build wharves that go beyond the State line?

21

MR. FREDERICK:

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

23
24
25

No.

Our position is that --

Well, then boundries don't

matter completely.
MR. FREDERICK:

No, they can -- under

Delaware law, a riparian owner in New Jersey can extend
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

past the low-water mark as has been permitted by New

2

Jersey, by Delaware in every single instance since 1961

3

when Delaware enacted subaqueous land laws, except the

4

two times where New Jersey riparian owners sought to

5

violate Delaware's laws by building LNG facilities:

6

1972 when the El Paso Company sought to build an LNG

7

facility and was denied by Delaware and New Jersey

8

acquiesced in that denial, and then in 2005 when

9

Delaware made the status determination that the Crown

In

10

Landing facility was a prohibited bulk transfer facility

11

precluded by Delaware law.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What if Delaware took the

13

position that there simply is the maximum amount of

14

allowable building in the river, and from now on it will

15

not, in fact, agree to grant, authorize, whatever the

16

title is, any further wharves and piers on New Jersey's

17

side?

18
19

Does Delaware have the authority to do that?
MR. FREDERICK:

Delaware can exercise its

police authority as --

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It's passed a statute.

21

MR. FREDERICK:

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Is the statute effective?

23

MR. FREDERICK:

The statute is not effected

Yes.

in the hypothetical that you give.

otherwise, on the bank.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I'm talking about a new

3

statute.

Delaware says enough is enough; no more wharfs

4

and piers from the New Jersey side.

5

effective and enforceable?

6

MR. FREDERICK:

Is that statute

That statute would be

7

subject to Delaware takings law, and Delaware has found

8

that --

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But, Mr. Frederick, if

10

the -- if the legislature of Delaware passes that

11

statute, I assume they intend it to mean what it says.

12

And as against a claim by New Jersey or on behalf of a

13

New Jersey grantee, is that Delaware statute effective?

14
15

MR. FREDERICK:

It depends.

Justice Souter,

it depends.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

17

MR. FREDERICK:

It depends on what?
The Constitution of the

18

United States and the constitution of Delaware.

19

private --

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

A

Forget the Federal right

21

now.

22

as this Compact is concerned, so far as the domestic

23

laws of the two states, New Jersey and Delaware, are

24

concerned, would the Delaware statute be effective?

25

We're talking about construing a compact.

MR. FREDERICK:

So far

The Delaware statute would
28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

not be affected by the 1905 Compact, Justice Souter,

2

because Delaware would assert presumably, if defending

3

that law, that it was subject to regular police power

4

restrictions.

5

But those police power restrictions --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

6

Delaware would say.

7

would say.

8

prevail when it got here --

I'm not asking you what

I think I can imagine what Delaware

I want to know whether Delaware would

9

MR. FREDERICK:

No.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

11

MR. FREDERICK:

-- in your view?
I don't think that Delaware

12

would prevail on a blanket prohibition of the exercise

13

of riparian rights by New Jersey landowners.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

15

MR. FREDERICK:

16

Why?
Because Delaware has always

permitted the exercise of riparian rights because --

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, that is before there

18

was all these wharves were out here, and Delaware is now

19

saying the facts have changed.

20

MR. FREDERICK:

Delaware certainly has the

21

power, under our theory of the case as recommended by

22

the Special Master, to implement its police powers.

23

Those police powers are always subject to constitutional

24

constraints.

25

extreme as it is, Justice Souter, the Constitution, both

And under the hypothetical you posed, as

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

under Delaware law and under the United States

2

Constitution, might well say the State has gone too far

3

in exercising its police --

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It seems to me you're

5

running away from the hypothetical.

I have the question

6

that Justice Souter has, basically to what extent does

7

concurrent jurisdiction apply, what are the limits that

8

we will apply in later cases to implement this concept

9

of concurrent jurisdiction?

In the laws of some States

10

you can't overburden an easement.

11

company an easement, it can't put huge 300-foot

12

structures on the easement without taking -- is that the

13

kind of analysis that we have to apply in order to make

14

your concurrent jurisdiction and the Master's concurrent

15

jurisdiction theory work?

16

MR. FREDERICK:

If you give a power

I'm not sure that you would

17

need to go that far, certainly in light of the practical

18

realities of the 150 years of shared use of the Delaware

19

River, Justice Kennedy.

20

Importantly, under New Jersey's theory, to

21

go to your hypothetical, Justice Souter, where the

22

entire bed of the river within the Twelve-Mile Circle

23

would be built out, that would be a functional

24

abrogation of this Court's boundary decision, because

25

this Court held that the land under the piers was not
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

belonging to New Jersey and that an attempt to extend

2

the entire boundary outward, water-ward, would be

3

overriding what this Court determined was the --

4

easement.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But again, you're changing

6

the hypothetical.

Your answer, I -- the answer that you

7

just gave, I presume would be the same whether Delaware

8

had passed any particular statute regarding wharfage

9

from the New Jersey side or whether it had -- you were

10

giving an answer which took into consideration the

11

Compact but which basically depended upon we'll call it

12

the general riparian law.

13

The question, however, is the effectiveness

14

of a Delaware statute directed specifically to this

15

issue that says "no more."

16

MR. FREDERICK:

17

That becomes a dormant

Commerce Clause problem, Justice Souter.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

He is asking about under

19

this thing.

20

obvious what the purpose of the hypothetical is.

21

saying that to give you the right to wharf out does not

22

mean that you can use the wharf for any purpose that's

23

contrary to the police power prescriptions of Delaware.

24

That is reasonable enough.

25

Forget about the Commerce Clause.

And it's

Well, what if one of the police power
31
Alderson Reporting Company

You're

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

prescriptions is you can't have a wharf?

2

can you flatly contradict what Article VII says?

3

really think you ought to give that one away.

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. FREDERICK:

Now, you know,
And I

Justice Scalia, under a

6

broad theory of where the boundary is in matters, it

7

would require New Jersey to have access to grant

8

Delaware lands.

9

Special Master, that would not be permitted.

And under our theory as accepted by the
If it is

10

simply a question of use, we would acknowledge that the

11

New Jersey riparian owner can --

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

I think you're eliminating

13

the right to wharf out.

14

allowing the construction of wharves, isn't that

15

correct?

16

Before 1905, New Jersey was

MR. FREDERICK:

There were only two proven

17

in the record, Justice Alito, and neither of which was

18

proved in this record to go beyond the low-water mark.

19

But, yes, you're right.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

go beyond a low-water mark?

22
23

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.

Parts of the Twelve

Mile Circle --

24
25

It was a wharf that didn't

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What did they do, jump onto

the land?
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

(Laughter.)

2

MR. FREDERICK:

No.

In parts of the Twelve

3

Mile Circle, Justice Scalia, particularly in Gloucester

4

County, there's marshy area where the low-water area

5

extends hundreds of feet into the river.

6

where the boundary is -- is determined.

7

necessary in some places within the Twelve Mile Circle

8

to go beyond the low-water mark in order to build a

9

pier --

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

And that is
And it was not

Isn't it true -- we can look

11

and see what was authorized or not before 1905.

But

12

isn't it true that the ability to wharf out is a classic

13

American -- a classic riparian right --

14

MR. FREDERICK:

Certainly.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- under U.S. law?

16

MR. FREDERICK:

Certainly.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

And in deciding whether to

18

allow someone to wharf out, the State with jurisdiction

19

would decide whether the wharf was consistent with State

20

objectives, safety objectives, interference with

21

navigation and so forth?

22

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes, Justice Alito.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

And Article VII says that

24

each State on its own side of the river may continue to

25

make conveyances of riparian rights.
33
Alderson Reporting Company

So why doesn't

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that mean that each State is continued -- continues to

2

have the ability to authorize the wharfing out and to

3

decide whether particular wharves are consistent with

4

the State's police powers?

5

MR. FREDERICK:

The last part of your

6

question, Justice Alito, is where the rub lies, because

7

riparian law was subject to the individual determination

8

of what a riparian right was, and how the State's

9

regulation of that right as a private property right

10

would be determined.

11

hold is that the police power trumps that private

12

riparian right, and this was recognized by the attorney

13

general for New Jersey.

14
15

What this Court's cases uniformly

JUSTICE ALITO:

If you separate these two,

then the riparian right is worthless, is it not?

16

MR. FREDERICK:

I beg your pardon?

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

It's worthless if you

18

separate those two.

19

MR. FREDERICK:

No.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

If you say, New Jersey can

21

authorize wharfing out, except Delaware can say you

22

can't wharf out, because it's inconsistent with our

23

police power, then -- then the authorization to allow

24

wharfing out is meaningless.

25

MR. FREDERICK:

No, because wharfing out is
34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

always dependent on whether or not it is so far into the

2

river to impede the navigable channel, to become a

3

nuisance, and none of the cases by this Court talking

4

about wharfing rights concern the police powers issued

5

by the State.

6

the Federal riparian right given to the wharf owner in

7

Chicago was not -- could not override a State's

8

determination of how the wharf could be built, that

9

police power.

10

Cummings v The City of Chicago held that

Hudson v McCarter --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But that assumes that

11

there is going to be a wharf.

12

the police power means that there cannot be a wharf if

New Jersey says no.

16

inconsistent.

No.

Your answer to Justice Souter is,

Delaware can't say no more wharfs.

really at the rub of this case, which is what you do on

the wharf.

16

under your view the case comes down to whether or not

use of the wharf for a liquified natural gas terminal is

And all of the law and

20

evidence suggests that it is not.

grants that New Jersey issued after its Wharf Act of 18

never contained a specification of use.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

10

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, that's the question.
And the answer, Justice

11

Souter, is not decided by the facts on the case here but

12

rather on the individual circumstances.

13

that there are hypotheticals that --

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I appreciate

Then your answer to Justice

Alito is, tell me more about the circumstances and I

Clause considerations.

Because there are

There are dormant Commerce

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.

So what we want

21

to know it whether or not there are constraints in the

22

Compact.

23

MR. FREDERICK:

The Compact does not contain

24

the constraints, the Attorney General of New Jersey

25

recognized it, and this is at the appendix starting at
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

905 of the Delaware appendix.

2

Attorney General Robeson issued a very lengthy and

3

scholarly opinion on the difference between the powers

4

that a State could exercise over riparian rights, and he

5

distinguished in that opinion between what he called the

6

great public uses, which would be for defense, for the

7

environment, for protection of the people's safety, and

8

what were deemed to be public uses.

9

using those riparian lands for a railway bridge or a

terminal that would be for commercial purposes.

11

And he said that in the instance of the

12

great public uses, there would not be a need to pay

13

compensation because that great public right overrided

14

the riparian proprietor's exercise of riparian right.

15

With respect to the public use, however, and this is at

16

page 910 to 911 Delaware's appendix, he said that with

17

respect to those public uses, there might be a

18

requirement for a taking or a payment of compensation.

19

And so Justice Souter, I appreciate that our

20

position has a frustration, in the sense that it does

21

require individual facts.

22

that in the 160 years in which the -- New Jersey

Delaware has permitted that in every single instance,

6

something was a nuisance, and that didn't come up.

I thought that for most of this period until the

MR. FREDERICK:

It is correct that Delaware

8

regulated by the common law, Justice Ginsburg, but as

9

the Special Master correctly found just because the

10

limitation under the FX judicial precedents is for

11

nuisances does not mean there is no regulation.

12

Delaware chose to override its common law riparian

13

jurisdiction by implementing statutes, New Jersey

14

acceded to them to the point that in its consideration

15

of coastal zone management laws in the 1970s, the

16

attorney general of New Jersey was specifically

17

consulted whether compliance with the Federal statute

18

and Delaware statutes was necessary.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, then what does

the 1905 Compact give New Jersey?

11

MR. FREDERICK:

It gives New Jersey the

12

right to say who shall be the riparian owners to

13

exercise their rights, what they can do, and up to the

14

point where there would be an encroachment of the police

power of the State, the permission to do that.

Yet this Court held that that did not include

issue there.

2

MR. FREDERICK:

The decision in Virginia v.

3

Maryland is distinguishable in a number of ways, and if

4

I could take a moment to go through those ways.

5

The first is that it involved a different

6

Compact with different language.

The 1785 Compact

7

between Virginia and Maryland specifically provided that

8

each -- the citizens of each State shall have "full

9

property in the shores of the Potomac River."

The court

10

construed the phrase "full property" to include riparian

11

rights.

12
13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

New Jersey does

not have full property in the shore of the Delaware?

14

MR. FREDERICK:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

Excuse me.

for distinguishing.

17

Yes.
Well, then that's no basis

What else is there?

MR. FREDERICK:

The Black-Jenkins award

18

issued to resolve the boundary line was decided in 1877.

19

And in that arbitration decision, Maryland specifically

20

represented that the boundary should be drawn around the

21

wharves that were on the Virginia side of the boundary

22

so that the boundary, instead of being at the low-water

23

mark, would carve out every pier that had been

24

constructed.

25

The arbitrators rejected that, but in the
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

process provided that the riparian owners on the

2

Virginia side could go beyond the low-water mark -- that

3

is a direct quote -- "beyond the low-water mark to

4

exercise their riparian rights."

5

Congress --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's the case here

6

as well.

7

Compact has the right to grant riparian rights,

8

including wharfing out, that go beyond the low-water

9

mark.

10

There's no doubt that New Jersey under the

MR. FREDERICK:

The doubt here, Mr. Chief

11

Justice, is what the phrase "own side" means.

And we

12

think the better reading of own side is captured by the

13

grants part of the Special Master's recommendation is

14

that own side means the boundary.

15

that a right can be exercised, a riparian right

16

authorized by New Jersey beyond the low-water mark, it

17

is still subject to the police powers.

But to the extent

18

And at page 10 of the Special Master's

19

report in Virginia v. Maryland, the Special Master

20

specifically said this case does not concern the

21

exercise of the police powers, but rather the mere

22

withdrawal of the water.

23

the types of general police powers that would apply to

24

the riparian right.

too.

5

He was uniquely positioned in this

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I don't understand the

6

difference between withdrawing water as not being

8

9

MR. FREDERICK:

That could mean they

Well, what the court held

10

and what was decided in that case was that the taking of

11

the water by Virginia was not to the level where it

12

would give rise to the kind of police concern that

13

Maryland might express.

14

The court left that issue open.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't understand that.

15

It's up to Maryland what's a concern.

16

doesn't want any water taken, why isn't that a valid

17

exercise of Maryland's police power?

18

MR. FREDERICK:

If Maryland

It would be a valid

19

exercise, but I was answering Mr. Chief Justice's

20

question about what is left of it.

21

what is left of it is that Virginia can continue to

withdraw water from the Potomac River.

It would -- it would be a

of similar riparian rights?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

4

MR. FARR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

5

May I just say two things, and, first of all, something

6

that we haven't really talked about this morning.

7

With respect to matters of nuisance and all,

8

Federal law provides a substantial array of laws:

The

9

Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Coastal Zone

10

Management Act, the Rivers and Harbors Act, all of those

11

things.

12

Anything built out from New Jersey has to

13

undergo Federal review; and, subject to the Compact,

14

Delaware has rights to participate at that Federal

15

level.

16

bill of complaint deals with, is the question of whether

17

Delaware can do what it did here, which is apply its

18

State law enacted under its police power to say that a

19

proposed project, riparian project, for the New Jersey

20

side is impermissible and cannot be built.

21

dealing just with the law of State versus State.

22

So what we are talking about here, and what the

So we are

Now -- so I'd like to suggest if -- if we

23

put ourselves in the shoes of the Commissioners who were

24

negotiating this Compact in 1905, what is the likely

25

reaction if Article VII -- if, now, Delaware had
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

proposed at the time that, instead of the language as it

2

is now, at the end of Article VII the words were added

3

"subject to the police power of the other State"?

4

New Jersey obviously would have had the

5

reaction to that that that is something that depends on

6

the boundary.

7

going to be able to exercise any police power on the

8

Delaware side, because there is no boundary dispute that

would involve that.

There is no chance that New Jersey is

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

Why

shouldn't it be a one-way veto?

16

18

It's a one-way pass.

Well -It doesn't give Delaware

anything.
MR. FARR:

Well, except for the fact that,

20

again, if we put ourselves in their shoes, it seems to

21

me what New Jersey would say is:

22

that you can veto all of our riparian projects using

23

your police power because of your view of the boundary,

24

why are we dismissing the case that we just filed, or

25

filed in 1877 --

If you are proposing

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. FARR:

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You are saying that the --

--to determine the boundaries?
You are saying that the

4

concept of "riparian rights" displaces the police power,

5

to a large extent.

6

MR. FARR:

To the extent that the exercise

7

of the police power is inconsistent with the power of

8

the State, the authority of the State, to authorize a

9

pier or wharf for the purposes for which piers and

10

wharves are used, which is the loading and unloading of

11

goods.

12

If that is what the State -- if that is what

13

New Jersey has done, that is not subject to an override

14

or a veto by Delaware exercising its police power.

15

mean this was an important value at the time that the

16

Compact was enacted, and New Jersey would not have

17

lightly let Delaware veto it.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I

Mr. Farr, can I ask

you a question as purely a --

20

MR. FARR:

Of course.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- matter of

22

curiosity?

The parties talk about the Duke of York's

23

grant to William Penn in this case, but nobody ever

24

explains where Delaware came from.

25

where did Delaware -- I mean a grant to William Penn is
56

How did that --

Pennsylvania.

2

Where -- when did Delaware --

MR. FARR:

Oh, there were -- I think there

3

were further grants along the process and further

4

division of -- of territory.

5

actually explained in New Jersey v.

6

may be leading you in the wrong direction, but I don't

7

think so.

8

11

I think some of that is

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Delaware, too.

Thank you.

The case

is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:06 p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
