ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

10

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT FERC,

11

14

The Court will hear argument

IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. KNEEDLER:

Thank you, Justice Stevens,

and may it please the Court:
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in

15

this case reasonably denied Respondent's request to

16

modify the wholesale contracts that the purchasing power

17

companies had entered into in 2000 and 2001.

18

Commission reasonably concluded that Respondents had not

19

made the requisite showing under the Federal Power Act

20

and under this Court's decisions in Mobile and Sierra

21

that modification of the contracts was necessary in the

22

public interest.

23

The

In reaching that conclusion, FERC first drew

24

on three factors that this Court had identified in

25

Sierra and found that they were not satisfied.
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Thus, it

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

found that Respondents had failed to show that the

2

contracts would impose financial strain on the

3

purchasing companies; that it would impose excessive

4

burdens on the customers; or that they were unduly

5

discriminatory.

6

But FERC also looked -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But FERC thought it could

7

live with the Ninth Circuit's decision, because the

8

government recommended that we deny cert in this case;

9

isn't that so?

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

That is -- that is correct,

11

and FERC thought that perhaps the decision could be

12

limited to the circumstances arising out of the

13

California energy crisis in the years 2000- 2001, and

14

that it could channel its concerns about contract

15

stability through those other factors.

16

But, nonetheless, FERC believes, as its

17

decisions make clear and as our position in this Court

18

makes clear, that the Ninth Circuit's reformulation of

19

the Mobile-Sierra doctrine or interpretation of the act

20

was incorrect.

21

review, we urge affirmance of FERC's decision in this

22

case.

23

And, now that the Court has granted

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Wasn't it clear to the

24

government that the Ninth Circuit, which is what, about

25

10 percent of the country, was going to continue this
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

interpretation of the act, and that was not a matter of

2

any consequence to FERC or to the government?

3

MR. GARRE:

It was of consequence, but FERC

4

still believed it had some interpretive authority after

5

the decision.

6

time, but FERC thought that it still had some

7

interpretive authority under the decision, and that it

8

could -

9

Maybe this was a wrong judgment at the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But, Mr. Kneedler, this

10

is a decision, the Ninth Circuit decision, that empowers

11

FERC.

12

And the Ninth Circuit said:

13

agency arguing that it can't do what the Ninth Circuit

14

says it can.

15

decisions of this Court.

FERC says:

16

Oh, we don't have that authority.
Yes, you do.

And why can it not?

So this is an

Because of two

Is that right?

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, two decisions of this

17

Court and 50 years of intervening FERC, before that

18

Federal Power Commission, practice.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, wait, wait, wait.

20

didn't just say the agency may do it.

21

agency must do it.

22

to be an empowerment.

23

direction.

24
25

I don't -- I don't consider "must"
I consider that to be a

MR. KNEEDLER:
correct.

It said the

Right.

That -- that is

I mean it, I think -- I took the question to
6
Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

be that it might give FERC broader flexibility, but at a

2

very substantial cost to the stability of contracts,

3

which was the underlying point that this Court stressed

4

in its decision in Sierra:

5

unlike -- and the Natural Gas Act, unlike the Interstate

6

Commerce Act, contemplates that rates will be set by

7

contract, or at least can be set by contract; and that

8

therefore, like in most situations, a party to a

9

contract cannot unilaterally walk away from that

That the Federal Power Act,

10

contract or insist upon its modification because it may

11

become disadvantageous over time.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought -- let's go

13

back a step.

I thought FERC's position was:

14

not decide as a matter of discretion to do this because

15

we are limited by those Supreme Court decisions.

16

MR. GARRE:

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We could

Well, FERC So it's not what FERC -

18

FERC independently interpreting the statute to reach the

19

conclusion, which it might, to reach the conclusion the

20

Ninth Circuit did.

21

because we have our marching orders from the Supreme

22

Court.

23

It's FERC saying:

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

We can't do that

I think -- I mean there

24

are -- there are two interpretive questions here:

25

does the public interest standard identified in this
7
Alderson Reporting Company

When

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Court's decisions in Mobile and Sierra apply?

2

there is the further question of what is necessary to

3

satisfy the public interest standard for modifying a

4

contract.

5

And then

We think on both points the Commission's

6

decision in this case reflects an interpretive judgment

7

that the Court's decision, or the interpretation

8

reflected in the Court's decision, in Sierra applies

9

equally in the market-based rate system without any of

10

the -- either of the two prerequisites that the Ninth

11

Circuit formulated as a precondition to applying the

12

public interest standard.

13

And I would point the Court's attention, in

14

the joint appendix in the Commission's decision, to

15

joint appendix 1244 and 1245, repeated again at 1572 and

16

1573; and also the passage quoted in the Morgan Stanley

17

brief at page 17, reflects a determination of what the

18

Commission's longstanding policy has been that,

19

contracts once entered into, their integrity must be

20

protected and should not be lightly set aside.

21

And also, the Commission specifically

22

rejected at pages 1564 and 1565 of the joint appendix

23

the prerequisites that the Ninth Circuit came up with in

24

this case, that there must be an opportunity to

25

determine whether the rates were within a zone of just
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and reasonableness at the time the contracts were

2

entered into in order for Mobile and Sierra to apply.

3

Under a market-based rate system, what FERC

4

does is determine at the outset when an applicant

5

applies for a market-based tariff whether that company

6

has market power and if so, whether it's mitigated.

7

Only in those circumstances is the company granted the

8

authority to market -- to set prices by the market.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

What happens if that

10

approval is given and then a seller enters into

11

contracts and then it's later discovered that, contrary

12

to what FERC thought when it granted the approval, the

13

seller has exercised market power or has otherwise

14

manipulated the market?

15

situation?

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

Is there any remedy in that

Well, what the Commission

17

determined in this case is that there was -- there was

18

no manipulation or exercise of market power identified

19

with respect to these specific contracts.

20

Commission decided was that the importance of the

21

integrity of contracts in that circumstance required

22

that the contract be maintained.

23

shown bad faith or something like that in the

24

connection -- or fraud in connection with the formation

25

of these particular contracts, that would have been

And what the

If the Respondents had

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

quite a different matter.

2

It's also important to note that the

3

Commission found in this case that there was no

4

dysfunction in the forward market, which is what we have

5

here.

6

in the spot market in 2000, 2001 for a variety of

7

reasons, some of them going to market fundamentals such

8

as a shortage of generation capacity, a shortage of

9

hydropower.

10

What was going on is that there was dysfunction

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Just so I understand your

11

answer to Justice Alito's question, the Commission has

12

retroactive authority to alter the permission to engage

13

in these contracts only if there is fraud -

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

No it can -- I'm sorry -

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

-- or something similar?

Once it has granted

17

market-based rate authority, FERC can revoke that.

18

in fact, companies -- there is a triennial review of

19

that -

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

And

Retroactive?

Pardon?

No.

Retroactively?
It would be revoked But Justice Alito's

question, I think as I understood it, or at least a
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

question in my mind that followed upon it, was whether

2

or not -- what's the basis for any retroactive

3

revocation of that or -

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

5

retroactive.

6

that was filed.

7

No, it wouldn't be

It would be from the date of the complaint

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Would it be a public

8

interest finding, a finding that because of the market

9

manipulation by the seller that affected this very

10

contract, the public interest demands that we not hold

11

the -

12
13

MR. KNEEDLER:

In that situation there

is an important public interest in eliminating fraud.

14
15

Yes.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I didn't say fraud.

I said

market manipulation.

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

Or market manipulation.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Isn't the remedy for the

18

finding of market manipulation the abrogation of the

19

contract, which is a separate process from, from the

20

revocation of market-based tariff?

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

There are.

22

point I was going to make -

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

24
25

And this is the

The same reason may support

each, but MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

I was going to make

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that point in response to Justice Kennedy's question.

2

If it turns out that subsequent evidence shows that a

3

particular company has acquired market-based power, then

4

FERC can revoke that authority on a going-forward basis

5

to continue to sell on that basis.

6

companies are required to report any changes in their

7

circumstances that might affect their market power, and

8

there is a triennial review of that.

9

the market -

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And in fact,

But as long ago

Did the companies who

11

were involved in this case make those reports?

12

there was something about during this energy crisis

13

there was rampant noncompliance with the filing, with

14

the quarterly report filing.

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

I mean,

There was, and the Ninth

16

Circuit found that in the Lockyer decision.

But that is

17

the sort of flaw and market oversight that should be

18

addressed directly by FERC.

19

shouldn't be addressed by collateral attacks on

20

contracts that were entered into under the regulatory

21

regime as it existed.

It shouldn't be -- it

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Kneedler, I'm not

23

entirely understanding you.

24

the seller later acquired market power have anything to

25

do with whether the initial contract, when he did not

Why should the fact that

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have market power, was a fair one?

2

already down in black and white, his later acquisition

3

of market power cannot affect -

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

The contracts are

No, that is certainly

5

correct.

6

Circuit -- actually, the Ninth Circuit wasn't addressing

7

market power.

8

market dysfunction.

9

I think the question, what concerned the Ninth

It was addressing the possibility of

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I understand.

But later

10

acquisition of market power would result in a

11

cancellation of the permission for this particular firm

12

to enter into contracts for the future, but I don't see

13

why it would affect the past contracts.

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

And we don't think it should,

15

except to the extent the public interest standard is

16

met.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Maybe I think I led us into

18

this, Mr. Kneedler.

The situation that I was positing

19

was a situation in which the power marketer had engaged

20

in market manipulation in the context of which, at the

21

time of which, it made this contract.

22

to you, which I think you took, was that in a situation

23

like that there would be a basis for public interest

24

review and abrogation of this contract because of the

25

market manipulation in fact.
13
Alderson Reporting Company

And my suggestion

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And the market manipulation would also be a

2

reason to say market power had been acquired.

3

not been mitigated, and hence, the market-based tariff

4

authority would also be revoked.

5

was the limit of my question.

6

there is it could do each of those things?

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

It had

And that was the, that

And I take it your answer

Yes.

It could revoke the

8

market-based power going forward.

And with respect to

9

manipulation, especially if there was manipulation

10

affecting the particular contract, that would be a basis

11

for finding that the public interest required the

12

contract to be modified.

13
14

If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of
my time.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Kneedler, I do have

16

one question.

17

December of 2000, when it was encouraging the entrance

18

into the long-term contracts rather than using the spot

19

market, and in that order FERC said that it would

20

monitor long-term contracts vigorously for rate

21

reasonableness and that buyers could challenge rates

22

through 206 proceedings.

23

position?

24
25

It was the position that FERC took in

MR. KNEEDLER:

What happened to that

This is such a challenge, but

what FERC has concluded is that the public interest
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

standard has to be satisfied in that situation.

2

encouraged parties to go into the long-term market in

3

order to diminish the market volatility and it would

4

frustrate that encouragement of policy -

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6
7

FERC

And how did FERC monitor

the rates vigorously to make sure they were reasonable?
MR. KNEEDLER:

There was extensive staff

8

studies and monitoring in subsequent decisions that are,

9

that are shown and that are in the joint appendix, in

10

April -- in January and April and June when FERC came up

11

with its final program to mitigate the problems in the

12

spot market.

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

14

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER

15

Mr. Dellinger.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

16

MR. DELLINGER:

17

morning, and may it please the Court:

18

Justice Stevens, good

Justice Ginsburg began by asking whether the

19

Ninth Circuit decision did not in fact empower rather

20

than restrict the authority of the Commission.

21

answer is that the Ninth Circuit decision fundamentally

22

precludes the Commission from carrying out what the

23

Commission believes is essential to its mandate to

24

assure an abundancy of electrical energy at the lowest

25

possible cost.

The

And that is to encourage a market-based
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

approach to recognize that if you're going to have, as

2

the Commission has said, the kind of investment in the

3

building of infrastructure to produce energy, people are

4

going to have to be able to rely upon long-term

5

contracts.

6

In this case, what the Ninth Circuit's

7

decision did is to take away a very important option

8

that the Commission believes is essential in times of

9

market volatility and dysfunction.

And that is the

10

option for parties to get out of the spot market and to

11

enter into a long-term contract of a secure supply.

12

If the Ninth Circuit's decision stood,

13

literally parties, buyers and sellers, would both be

14

precluded from entering into that, because you would

15

know if there were dysfunction that nothing you could

16

say in the contract could mean that you could buy power

17

for the next eight years at $105 at a time, as was the

18

case here, when the spot market was $300.

19

away the option.

20

enter into a contract they could rely upon subject only

21

to being overridden in the public interest, which FERC

22

does.

23

processes which the Commission has used consistent with

24

this Court's decision of 50 years ago to encourage

25

development in this industry.

It would take

And sellers would know they couldn't

And that would be very damaging to the very

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, those decisions are

2

puzzling transposed to this setting, because in those

3

decisions it was the seller who had made a bad bargain;

4

the price was too low; and the seller wanted to get out,

5

right?

6

MR. DELLINGER:

Yes.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And now we are

8

transposing that.

And one of the main themes I think of

9

Justice Harlan's decision was this Act was meant to

10

protect the consumer, to make sure that the consumer

11

wasn't going to be overcharged.

12

those two 1956 decisions, at a time when there was no

13

market-based authority, or any such, right?

And that runs through

14

MR. DELLINGER:

15

Ginsburg, that is correct.

16

seller was seeking to get out of a contract that was

17

paying too low.

18

Well, yes.

Justice

That was a case where a

But the fundamental purpose -- the Court

19

recognized even in Justice Harlan's opinion that

20

maintaining the stability and expectation of contracts

21

was going to be important to consumers, to buyers as

22

well as to sellers.

23

that position.

In this -- and FERC has adopted

24

In this case you have a situation where the

25

Commission decided that instability in the spot markets
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

was being partly caused by the fact that the State

2

regulatory process had discouraged people from entering

3

into longer term contracts; and FERC said in its 2000

4

San Diego order, we strongly urge utilities to move

5

their load to long-term contracts of two years or more.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's the same order

7

where they said we are going to monitor the rates for

8

reasonableness.

9

MR. DELLINGER:

That is true.

And when they

10

did indeed undertake a review of this, they decided that

11

with respect to these contracts there was no evidence of

12

bad faith.

13

was no evidence of duress.

14

market manipulation that affected the contracts

15

specifically in these long-term cases.

16

There was no evidence of unfairness.

There

There was no evidence of any

The long-term contracts were part of the

17

solution or the mitigation of the problem.

18

long-term contract that allowed the utilities in this

19

case to get out from under $300 a megawatt prices and to

20

enter into a contract at $105, in one of the cases.

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It was a

Can I ask this question?

22

Assuming there is absolutely no bad faith or fraud or

23

anything like that, but there is just a general

24

conclusion that the market was such -- in such turmoil

25

that there could not be made reasonable or long-term
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

contracts, because the predicate for that kind of

2

negotiation just didn't exist.

3

for setting aside the contract?

4

MR. DELLINGER:

Would that be a basis

No; and it's very important

5

that not be a basis, because if that were the case,

6

parties would know and parties -- both -- all parties

7

were aware that there was volatility, and the Commission

8

had announced that the conditions were conducive to

9

manipulation of the spot markets.

That would mean that

10

a seller would say to a buyer, we know you would like to

11

get out of this volatility and get a regular supply

12

guaranteed at a -- at a much lower price for long term.

13

We can't enter into that contract, because the fact that

14

we know there has been this problem in the market means

15

that our contract won't be upheld.

16

Now, the Ninth Circuit decision says that

17

contract terms are not binding if they were influenced

18

by a dysfunctional market; and that is the very most

19

important circumstance in which having long-term

20

contracting is most valuable.

21
22
23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is volatile the same as

dysfunctional?
MR. DELLINGER:

Justice Kennedy, I don't

24

know precisely what the Ninth Circuit means by

25

dysfunctional.

There is volatility.
19
Alderson Reporting Company

I think the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

difference would be is there manipulation, is one

2

factor; there were a number of factors that caused the

3

volatility here -

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Dellinger, does that

mean that it is your position that no matter how

6

dysfunctional the market was, just complete turmoil, as

7

long as the contract was made in good faith without any

8

fraud or abuse of power, it's a binding contract?

9

MR. DELLINGER:

That is correct, unless -

that the utility would go out of business?

MR. DELLINGER:

That is an example that the

22

Court gave in Mobile and -- and Sierra.

circumstances would have to be rather extraordinary.

25

Because whenever you were to modify the terms of a

market.

They also went out on the

They are buying and selling.

4

So unraveling all of these buying and

5

selling would itself be -- would be dysfunctional; but

6

what sellers would know thereafter is that they couldn't

7

rely upon the contracts.

8

out of that market or they would have to charge a risk

9

premium, which would raise prices to buyers and

10

They would either have to stay

consumers.

11

So that long run harm of making it less

12

reliable to engage in contracting would have to be

13

overcome by a fairly severe showing of what the

14

short-term harms would be to one particular set of

15

buyers.

16

The Commission has made those findings.

17

They found circumstances where the contracts gave first

18

priority to commercial uses of power, and at a time of

19

shortage that meant that residential customers would be

20

cut off.

21

The Commission ordered that done.
The Commission has been on the job here.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You said the Commission

6

is on the job, but one of the pieces of information here

7

is that the Commission staff said that the dysfunction

8

in the spot market carried over into the forward market,

9

such that prices in the forward market were inflated.

10

MR. DELLINGER:

That is correct.

But what

11

the Commission realized is that the parties were aware

12

of what was going on in the spot market.

13

to contract on that basis.

14

what's called a Memphis clause, giving either party the

15

right to seek modification based on some administrative

16

determination of what a right price would be at some

17

later point.

18

that allowed only joint approaches to the Commission,

19

and indeed in one contract said that the rates are fixed

20

and shall remain in effect for the terms of this

21

agreement.

22

could not enter into a long-term contract and assure

23

that the terms were binding.

They were able

They did not.

They kept in the clauses

That language is illustrative of how you

JUSTICE SCALIA:
that statement means, anyway.

The fact that I don't understand what
The current dysfunction

Alderson Reporting Company

1

carries over into -- into the future market?

2

that mean?

3

MR. DELLINGER:

Right.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What does

Well -

Does it mean that because

5

of the current dysfunction, you can't predict for sure

6

what the rates are going to be down the road?

7

it means that.

8

that?

9

11

But doesn't a dysfunction always mean

MR. DELLINGER:

10

Of course

Yes.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Dysfunction -

And isn't that why you

enter into long-term contracts?

12

MR. DELLINGER:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

Because given the current

14

dysfunction you have no idea what the price is going to

15

be down the road.

16

MR. DELLINGER:

That's exactly right.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Dellinger, wasn't the

18

staff saying something more than that in that -- in that

19

report?

20

MR. DELLINGER:

I don't -- I don't know what

21

you're intimating, but what the conclusion was of the

22

Commission was, for example, that there was no basis to

23

support a finding that the Respondents exercised market

24

--

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the Commission didn't

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

-- didn't respond to the staff report, right?

2

say anything one way or another about it.

3

MR. DELLINGER:

Didn't

Well, the Commission

4

expressly said with respect to the -- to the staff

5

report that there was no evidence of any manipulation.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Did they say it with

7

respect to the staff report?

8

thought the staff report was irrelevant?

9

MR. DELLINGER:

Or -- I thought they

Yes.

The aspect of the

10

staff report that said that forward prices were

11

influenced by prices in the spot market and that there

12

had been dysfunction was irrelevant precisely because it

13

would have been relevant were the Commission making its

14

own bureaucratic determination of a right price.

15

the parties made the determination of the prices that

16

they wanted to agree to, the terms they wanted to agree

17

to, and they did so with full knowledge both that they

18

knew there had been some manipulation, that there was

19

volatility and that they knew they didn't know, as

20

Justice Scalia, said the extent of it; and, therefore,

21

that's precisely why you want to be involved in a

22

contract that guarantees you today that, no matter what

23

happens to prices in the next year or next summer, one

24

of these -- one of these utilities has a guarantee of

25

power at $105.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. WRIGHT

11

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

12
13
14

MR. WRIGHT:

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and

may it please the Court:
I'd like to start off by picking up on

15

Justice Ginsburg's observation that FERC understood

16

itself to be without discretion here, and add the point

17

that this is an extremely unusual case where FERC

18

thought it lacked discretion to apply the statute.

19

the briefs, there is now agreement that the just and

20

reasonable standard applies to all rates under the Act

21

and couldn't be more clear that the just and reasonable

22

standard applies.

23

In

FERC -

JUSTICE ALITO:

Among your arguments, and

24

the arguments of the Respondent, seems to be in some

25

tension -- seems to me in some tension to FERC's
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

market-based rate program.

2

that that is permissible interpretation of the Federal

3

Power Act or not?

4

MR. WRIGHT:

Do you -- do you acknowledge

I -- there is much that we

5

don't disagree with about the market-based rate program.

6

I suppose we do think that there are two things that

7

FERC has to make sure that it does as part of that

8

program.

9

First, in -- in approving the market-based

10

rate program, Judge Douglas Ginsburg said when there is

11

a competitive market, FERC may rely upon market-based

12

rates in lieu of cost-of-service regulations.

13

makes perfect sense to us, but when there is a

14

competitive market.

15

market-based rate program is that there must be an

16

inquiry into whether or not the market was competitive

17

when the contract was entered into.

18

the unusual circumstance here where Professor Kahn and

19

nine other deregulatory economists wrote a letter in May

20

2001 saying markets are out of control, this is the

21

unusual circumstance where FERC should enter a price

22

cap.

23

That

So we think a critical part of a

JUSTICE ALITO:

Of course, we have

Isn't it -- isn't it a

24

central requirement of a market-based rate program that

25

FERC cannot, except perhaps in very limited
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

circumstances, go back and undo contracts that had been

2

entered into under that program, based on a

3

retrospective determination that the rates are not just

4

and reasonable, in the same sense that FERC would have

5

applied that term if the utility had simply filed a

6

tariff?

7

MR. WRIGHT:

Justice Alito, all rates must

8

be just and reasonable.

9

needs to go back to a cost-of-service ratemaking

We are not arguing that FERC

10

approach; but an agency that sees just and reasonable

11

and thinks it's applying a just and reasonable standard,

12

for 70 years has thought it's either going to do a

13

cost-of-service approach, or more recently it's going to

14

rely on the market to make rates just and reasonable,

15

our modest point is that it can't ignore the market.

16

--

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It

No, but I guess this is

18

what's bothering us.

Your point does not seem, at least

19

to me, to be a modest point, because if I understand

20

where you're going, you're saying that in a market with

21

the degree of volatility of this one at the time these

22

contracts were made, no contract is enforceable.

23

will last only so long as -- as one party does not

24

complain about a disadvantage, and the minute it does,

25

it's back in front of FERC.

It

And the argument is being

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

made that in fact a market-based rate cannot be enforced

2

through contract because the very premise -- i.e., what

3

you call and what was called a competitive -- Judge

4

Ginsburg called a competitive market -- was absent.

5

Isn't that the consequence of what you're arguing?

6

MR. WRIGHT:

Yes.

Let me make four points

7

here, though, that I think make absolutely clear that it

8

would not set a broad precedent to revisit the contracts

9

here.

10

And the four points are first, the

11

Government acknowledges in its brief at page 16, this

12

was the worst electricity market crisis in history.

13
14
15

Second JUSTICE SOUTER:

we're only in the second worst?

16

(Laughter.)

17

MR. WRIGHT:

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

19

Well, how do we know when

Well Well, but I mean the

problem is -

20

MR. WRIGHT:

No, no -

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And I don't see any -- and

22

I realize that you're giving me limiting principles to

23

what seems to me in effect a general rule that says no

24

contracts are enforceable, if they are made during

25

periods of market volatility, however sensible they may
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

be given the premise of that volatility.

2

And your first proposal for a limiting

3

principle is this is the worst of times, and I don't see

4

how that's going to help because somebody is always

5

going to claim, well, these times are -- are almost as

6

bad.

7

MR. WRIGHT:

Well, Your Honor, of course the

8

Federal Power Act instructs a Federal agency to ensure

9

that rates are just and reasonable.

10

Power Act -

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MR. WRIGHT:

14

A -- the Federal

Look -

The FERC, FERC needs to grapple

with this.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's a good -- I mean

15

that's a fine general phrase, but the question is, is it

16

possible to make an enforceable contract under these

17

circumstances?

18

MR. WRIGHT:

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

20
21

principle yet.

Well I haven't heard a limiting

You have three others.

MR. WRIGHT:

I have three others.

There was

22

rampant noncompliance with the reporting requirements.

23

The Government concedes that, too:

it's been improved, as the Government said in its

opposition to cert, however well it's been improved on

account of the 2005 amendments -

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Did these -- did -- did the

4

Petitioners here -- do you claim that the Petitioners

5

here were guilty of failure to report?

6

MR. WRIGHT:

Yes.

They -- they were not -

7

they were not complying with the -- we contend that the

8

reporting requirements that were in effect in 2001 were

9

inconsistent with the statute and not -

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's -- that's a

11

different issue.

12

Commission was derelict in -- in having a nonstatutory

13

condition.

14

you claim, is it a basis for your claim before FERC,

15

that these Petitioners failed to follow the reporting

16

requirements that were in effect?

17

That -- that may be that the

But did these -- did these Petitioners -- do

MR. WRIGHT:

Our -- our basic argument is

18

the rates weren't just and reasonable -

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

20

MR. WRIGHT:

That's what I thought.

And the rates weren't just and

21

reasonable on the day the contracts were signed.

22

let me make clear -

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And

Okay, but here I just want

24

to make sure I understand.

You're saying one -- one

25

limiting principle is the re-examination of contract
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

might be limited or at least only prompted by a -- a

2

failure to follow reporting requirements.

3

understand that and that offhand seems to me perfectly

4

fair.

It may not cover this case, but I can understand

5

that.

What are your other two reasons?

6

MR. WRIGHT:

I can

My third is, as Commissioner

7

Massey stated in his dissent, without contradiction by

8

the majority, that if the just and reasonable standard

9

were -- would be applied, these rates would be declared

10

unlawful, because they were multiples of traditional

11

prices.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay, but that seems to me

13

consistent with the problem that I have with your

14

argument.

15

period of high volatility, and it seems reasonable to

16

the two parties to come up with a rate that is certainly

17

a higher rate than anybody would come up with if they

18

were going through cost-plus-return ratemaking, the

19

contract is vulnerable.

20

Commissioner Massey's argument is consistent with the

21

conclusion that all those contracts are vulnerable.

22

I don't see that as any limiting principle.

23

fourth one?

24
25

And that is, if you make a contract in a

MR. WRIGHT:

And it seems to me that

So

What's your

The fourth one is, as Justice

Ginsburg has noted, that FERC said in December 2000,
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

before all of the contracts at issue were negotiated,

2

that it would monitor and -- and would -- deems rates

3

above $74 suspect.

4

above that benchmark.

5

history; there's rampant noncompliance; rates were

6

multiples of traditional pricings, and FERC had said it

7

was going to study these rates closely.

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All the contracts in here have rates
So it's the worst crisis in

Okay, I can understand -

9

under your fourth point, I could understand the position

10

if the argument were this is above $74, and therefore it

11

is suspect; but the claim you're making, as I understand

12

it, is a much broader claim.

13

contract ought to be abrogated in the public interest,

14

not merely above 74 but below 74.

15
16

MR. WRIGHT:

21
22

Well, I'm sorry, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And when you get there,

you're saying abrogate this contract.

19
20

Isn't that correct?

We want this case to be sent back to FERC.

17
18

You're saying the entire

MR. WRIGHT:

We are saying reduce the rates,

and JUSTICE SOUTER:

Are you saying -- have you

at any point said reduce the rates to $74?

points.

MR. WRIGHT:

7

our four points -

I appreciate the

It's helped me get out what I think

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If -- if your theory

9

prevails and you go back to the Commission, does the

10

Morgan Stanley contract, where the lower rate seller

11

was, does that get reevaluated, too?

the contracts back down the line?

MR. WRIGHT:

You reevaluate all

Well, I -- does Morgan

of parties in Morgan Stanley's situation chose to file

We're not, Your Honor, but I

would remind you this is a plain-language case.

would you go about determining in this case?

We expect that, ultimately, it will do, or

should do, what it's done with respect to the spot

market.

provided relief to parties who bought at the same time.

5

And what it has done is it has -- it has determined what

it calls a mitigated market clearing price.

With respect to the spot market, it has

It has done this with great elaborate -

elaboration for periods as low as 10 minutes for the

has reduced them to what it calls the "mitigated market

detail in the -- in the Ninth Circuit's 2006 CPUC versus

Henry Ford choice.

3

of rates as long as they were unjust and unreasonable.

We didn't have any alternative, because of the market

5

manipulation, that allowed us to get a just and

reasonable rate on the spot market, on long-term markets

--

Any -- we had a choice of a variety

You were saying that the

enter into a long-term contract in order to mitigate the

11

effects of the chaotic spot market.

12

that.

MR. WRIGHT:

You understood

Your Honor, we think that FERC

5

could, and it seems clear that it will, distinguish

6

between the spot market and long-term contracts on these

7

bases.

8

then have to overcome a hurdle and show that there

9

wasn't effective competition at the time the long-term

10

Our point there is that we probably, if it does,

contracts were entered into.

11

FERC might rationally, once it grapples with

12

this, decide that that's the way the just and reasonable

13

standard applies.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but with respect,

15

doesn't that, in effect, mean -- going back to your

16

answer to Justice Ginsburg -- that what you really want

17

is to say there wasn't effective competition.

18
19
20

There wasn't effective competition because
the market was chaotic.
And, therefore, in a chaotic market,

21

including this one, a long-term contract which later

22

turns out to be disadvantageous to one side is

23

unenforceable.

24
25

Isn't that what you -- your real answer to
Justice Ginsburg is.

MR. WRIGHT:

Well, Your Honor, again, I

2

don't think we should prevail, and it's not our position

3

that we prevail, unless we show that we didn't have just

4

and reasonable alternatives at the time we entered into

5

the contract.

6

We don't think we can -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but I mean -- that's

We all know that there is a broad umbrella

The conditions in this case were

And what the other side is saying, I think,

14

is:

We each tried to make the most reasonable deal we

15

could, the most advantageous for us that we could, under

16

these conditions of chaos.

They certainly produced a rate that wouldn't

saying that that reasoning that I just tried to outline

is not sufficient reasoning for sustaining the contract.

4

Now, if I'm wrong, tell me.

If I'm right, it seems to me you're really

saying ditch the contracts if they were entered into in

a period of high volatility.

statute that protects consumers and says that consumers

get just and reasonable rates was enacted to prevent -

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The trouble is that

justness is a relational category, and you are -- I

think you are saying we don't have to consider justness

sake of the question -- the best that they could under

need the statute.

10

The statute is superfluous insofar as

requires fraud in the negotiation of the contract.

11

And, again, if Morgan Stanley can show that

12

it was a victim of manipulation, too, then it is

13

entitled to relief.

14

that with respect to some of these spot market deals

15

There has certainly been some of

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Wright, I really don't

17

understand why you would -- why you say, you know, if -

if the chaos is due to the weather or maybe, you know,

an Arab oil embargo or whatever, that that's perfectly

long as it's not manipulation by the seller, I don't see

how you have a -- I don't know -- an equitable case.

That's what's going on in the

And you're trying to save yourself from it.

MR. WRIGHT:

So

It -- on the equities, if the

local utilities end up bearing the brunt of making bad

10

judgments about the weather, that's one thing.

It's

11

quite another thing if there is rampant non-compliance,

12

hiding the fact that there's been massive withholding of

13

energy, and driving -- and these spikes were not

14

accidental, by any means.

15

know, a -- a sort of distinction that the -- that the

16

law draws all the time.

That seems to us to be, you

17

And let me say the example came -

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I'm still puzzled by your

19

answer to Justice Scalia.

20

an atom bomb or terrorism or something totally innocent,

21

where the parties are -- but it causes the same economic

22

consequence, namely:

23

than they otherwise would be, why do you draw the

24

distinction that he says doesn't make sense?

25

If, say, it is something like

That the rates are a lot higher

MR. WRIGHT:

Well, I guess the ultimate
42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

distinction is that there isn't somebody making a whole

2

lot of money on account of market manipulation

3

somewhere.

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, but in each case the

5

rates would be higher than they otherwise would, and

6

you'd have to say they're high enough to be no longer

7

just and reasonable.

8
9

MR. WRIGHT:

Well, "just and reasonable,"

again, has always -- has traditionally first meant a

10

sort of cost-of-service inquiry and more recently means

11

a market inquiry.

12

-- means a competitive market, an effective market, as

13

Professor Kahn said, not a market totally infected by

14

manipulation.

15
16

But, again, a market inquiry doesn't

And then, in any case -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Even if infected by an act

of God, it seems to me the same consequence.

17

MR. WRIGHT:

I guess consumers bear the

18

brunt of acts of God, but don't -- shouldn't bear the

19

brunt of market manipulation that was unlawful and now

20

is -

21
22
23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think you could argue

that it should be just the obverse.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Aren't you really arguing

24

-- no, but aren't you really making the argument that

25

the notion of justness does have an equitable component
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that looks to the source of the trouble; and if the

2

source of the chaos in the market are the very people

3

who are trying to make a profit on your contract, that

4

is a reason to say that that market-based rate is not a

5

just one, because they created the conditions that gave

6

them the leverage to get you to make the deal that you

7

made?

8
9
10

But if they are not guilty of improper
conduct in making it, then, you know, everybody has to
take his lumps.

11

Aren't you saying something like that?

MR. WRIGHT:

We don't know because FERC

12

hasn't looked at it, what -- who Morgan Stanley paid and

13

what they paid and who made the money here.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but just as a general

15

premise, in your answer to Justice Scalia weren't you

16

assuming something like that?

17

MR. WRIGHT:

We certainly think that the

18

best result would be that whoever was manipulating the

19

market ought to be the one who ends up getting their

20

return cut; and that the local utilities and any

21

innocent middlemen should be made whole, too.

22

fine.

23

That's

It was brought up earlier in discussing the

24

market-based rate program sort of what sorts of remedies

25

were allowed.

And let me say that -- well, I think this
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

came out, but the Enron example shows very well.

2

got market-based rate authority in 1993.

3

the only player, but was a leading player in the market

4

manipulation in 2000-2001.

5

lifting their market-based rate authority until 2003,

6

and they did it strictly prospectively.

7

Enron

Enron was not

FERC didn't get around to

It is a core point of our argument today

8

that that shouldn't be allowed.

9

was:

And I think the answer

Well, market-based rate authority only results in

10

lifting the market-based rate authority; a 206 action

11

under the Federal Power Act is where consumers get

12

relief.

13

That's right, and we're here to get relief,

14

and we think that ultimately the parties that

15

manipulated the market and made too much money on

16

account of the manipulation ought to -- ought to lose

17

what they paid; and, certainly, the ratepayers shouldn't

18

bear the costs; and if there are innocent middlemen they

19

shouldn't bear the cost, either.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And, to the extent that you

21

make that argument, that's an answer, sort of, to the

22

question that I put to you a couple of times:

23

isn't your argument anything less broad than the fact

24

that you can't make a contract in a chaotic market?

25

Why, why

And you are, at least as a subset of what
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you are saying, telling us that if the contract -- if

2

the chaos in the market was caused by the impropriety of

3

one contracting party, that party should not profit from

4

it.

5

extent that that is your position, it is an answer to my

6

question.

And I understand that answer.

That if -- to the

7

MR. WRIGHT:

Thank you, Your Honor.

8

And let me remind the Court that one case

9

that the other side I don't think has acknowledged

10

sufficiently is this Court's 1974 Texaco decision.

11

was a situation where FERC -- well, the Federal Power

12

Commission attempted -- attempted to do what the other

13

side is asking this Court to rule today, to essentially

14

make contracts sacrosanct and not subject to any

15

challenge.

16

That

FERC had told small producers that it

17

wouldn't -- that they could enter into contracts and

18

they didn't have to file the contracts, and the

19

Commission wouldn't review the contracts to see if they

20

were just and reasonable.

21

quote, "The Commission lacks authority to place

22

exclusive reliance on market prices," unquote.

23

This Court very clearly held,

Under this statute, which requires just and

24

reasonable rates, there must be coexistence between

25

contracts and a regulatory backstop.
46
Alderson Reporting Company

And, again, in the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

situation here that you helped me review -- the worst

2

electricity market crisis in history, rampant

3

non-compliance, rates that were multiples of traditional

4

levels, and couldn't be justified under anything FERC

5

has ever called a just and reasonable standard, and FERC

6

had said it was going to examine a benchmark -- this is

7

a case that FERC has to go back and explain why, at

8

least explain why it thinks these rates are just and

9

reasonable.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

MR. WRIGHT:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13
14

Just and reasonable when?

On the day they were made.
On the day they were

agreed to.
MR. WRIGHT:

15

because they were the product of market manipulation

16

that made all of the rates available -

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18
19
20
21

They were just and

reasonable MR. WRIGHT:

-- that made all rates unjust

and unreasonable on that date, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

But I think -- and here I

22

want to be clear on this -- you're saying they were not

23

just and reasonable on the date they were made, number

24

one, if the market manipulation that caused the chaos

25

was manipulation by these Petitioners.
47
Alderson Reporting Company

That at least is

Official - Subject to Final Review

part of your argument.

2

But I think you're also saying that the

3

rates were not just and reasonable if they were the

4

result of market manipulation by others, not these

5

Petitioners.

enough to encompass the second alternative?

Absolutely, Your Honor.

that the test can't be dysfunction; that FERC has to

to be drawn.

But FERC needs to do that.

FERC hasn't

FERC honestly thought -- again, this is an

24

unusual case.

FERC honestly thinks that the public

standard, is a completely different animal than the just

2

and reasonable standard.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If you are relying on the

4

narrowest ground that Justice Souter mentioned, namely,

5

manipulation by the seller, wasn't it incumbent on you

6

to demonstrate that there was manipulation by the

7

seller?

Has that been -- has that been established?

Well, didn't the ALJ find

there wasn't manipulation in this market, the forward

MR. WRIGHT:

And the ALJ found that the spot

market -- the ALJ found that the spot market

21

manipulation didn't affect the forward markets.

22

agrees to that today.

disowned it.

3

MR. WRIGHT:

FERC said it was irrelevant.

4

That was the part of FERC's first order, where it said

5

it is irrelevant whether the manipulation of the spot

6

markets affected manipulation in the long-term markets.

7

That would be relevant only if the just and reasonable

standard applies.

standard applies.

Of course, the just and reasonable

One final point.

One remarkable aspect of

this case is after FERC said that in its initial order,

said we won't do that.

On page 1589 of the

were discovery occurring in other proceedings, and found

no evidence to support a finding of market manipulation
50

that specifically affected the contracts at issue.

2

It's important to recognize that there were

two separate markets here.

4

which had struck in addition to all the weather and all

those things, it had structural problems requiring the

It's sufficient, though, to say that the

Alderson Reporting Company

And in

1

important now even than at the time of Mobile, because

2

you can't have a functioning market based-rate system

3

without confidence that contracts would be upheld.

4

In that situation, as this Court suggested

5

in Verizon, you had sophisticated buyers and

6

sophisticated sellers dealing in a situation in which

7

both knew that there was chaos in the spot market, that

8

there was -- there were structural problems there, and

9

that there were allegations of manipulation.

But those

10

allegations did not carry over to the, to the long-term

11

market.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

May I ask, I am sure you

13

understand that a finding that there was no

14

manipulations that affected these contracts is not the

15

same as a finding that there was no manipulation by

16

these sellers in the market.

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

finding that there was no manipulation?

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

22
23

And there is no such

That's correct.

But what -

And there is no finding

that there was by these sellers.
MR. KNEEDLER:

That's correct.

And what the

24

Commission was basically saying is we are treating the

25

long-term market situation differently.
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Some of these

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

sellers may have been engaged in manipulation in the

2

short-term market, but FERC was trying to draw a

3

distinction between the spot market and moving forward

4

and maintaining the integrity of markets in the

5

long-term where both the buyers and the sellers were

6

both buyers and sellers typically.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But, in fact, it didn't get

8

that articulate.

The closest it came to answering my

9

question, I take it, is at the point to which you

10

referred me in the joint appendix, no effect on these

11

contracts?

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

That's correct.

We don't

13

think FERC should have to engage in a market-based

14

evaluation of possible manipulation in order to hold two

15

parties, two sophisticated parties to their bargain.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, then what do you say

17

about the standard of justness?

18

you're saying it doesn't matter whether these particular

19

Petitioners manipulated the market creating the

20

conditions under which these contracts were made at a

21

price which turned out to be much higher than the spot

22

price would be later, it's irrelevant.

position, isn't it?

25

MR. KNEEDLER:

In effect, I think

That's your

to be taken into account -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I'm not talking about what

FERC said.

4

your position is that even if these people -- even if

5

these people -- Petitioners manipulated and that created

6

the -- or contributing to creating the market under

7

which these contracts were made, that is irrelevant in

looking at the contracts -

9

I'm talking about your position.

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think

I think that's something that

10

FERC would have to decide in this case.

11

believe a claim of that sort has been made here.

12

believe the claim has -

I

I'm not asking what claim

has been made.

I want to know -- I want to know what

the government's position is.
