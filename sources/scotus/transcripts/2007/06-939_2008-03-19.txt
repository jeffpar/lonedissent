ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIS J. GOLDSMITH

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

We'll hear argument

MR. GOLDSMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

10

In AB 1889, California defunded employer

11

speech about union organizing because the State's labor

12

policy is that such speech interferes with employee free

13

choice.

14

enhances employee free choice.

15

policy is designed to discourage exactly what the NLRA

16

promotes.

17

labor policy as an exercise of its spending authority is

18

irrelevant under Gould.

19

The Federal policy is that employer speech

The fact that California implemented its

If the -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

policy promotes it?

21

what -- what -

22

California's labor

Why do you say the labor

It certainly permits it, but

MR. GOLDSMITH:

Well, Your Honor, I think

23

that if you look at the exceptions to the policy, in

24

particular those that allow State funds to be spent for

25

things that clearly facilitate union organizing, for
3
Alderson Reporting Company

1

example, that it's not prohibited under AB -

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, I'm talking about the

3

-- the Federal policy.

4

promotes this employer speech.

5

promotes it?

6

not discourage it, but is that the same as promoting it?

7

You say the Federal policy
Why do you say it

It clearly permits it.

MR. GOLDSMITH:

It clearly does

I think -- I think it is,

8

Your Honor.

9

the cases of the NLRB have made clear that free, open,

10

robust debate is important on all matters having to do

11

with the union/employer relationship.

12

certainly what the Court noted in Linn.

13

I think that the cases of this Court and

That was

The fact that employer speech is, I think,

14

absolutely critical to an employee being well-enough

15

informed to make an informed judgment about whether to

16

say yes or no to a union, further underscores the point.

17

A union election or any situation involving

18

a contest of any sort between a union and an employer is

19

something on which both parties should have the right to

20

speak, and to speak in a noncoercive way, and I think

21

that clearly the National Labor Relations Act promotes

22

that.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then why did Congress in

24

several statutes have a provision from which California

25

copied when it enacted this measure?
4
Alderson Reporting Company

In several

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

statutes, the Congress has said this Federal money will

2

go to the grantee, if the grantee says it will not use

3

any money that we give them to assist, promote, or deter

4

union organizing.

5

MR. GOLDSMITH:

Your Honor, those are three

6

statutes that the court below and Respondents rely on

7

heavily.

8

any way reflect the meaning or the sense of Congress

9

that employer speech is to be inhibited in connection

Those statutes, first of all, I don't think in

10

with union organizing.

11

reflect the overall intent of Congress.

12

nothing in those statutes, in any way, undercuts the

13

basic principles of the -

14

Those in no way, I think,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

More ever,

But they run against that

15

principle because they say at least under these programs

16

-- I think there were more than three.

17

--

18

MR. GOLDSMITH:

Wasn't Medicare

Medicare was the fourth, I

19

believe.

It was a regulation not a statute.

But

20

certainly in doing that, Congress didn't in any way

21

modify the NLRA.

22

history of those statutes that suggests that this

23

Court's principles, as laid down in Machinists and

24

Garmon, were in any way to be inhibited.

25

what Congress can do certainly doesn't mean that the

There's nothing in the legislative

5
Alderson Reporting Company

And, moreover,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

States have the same right.

But -

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

3

would be subject to the NLRA.

4

modified.

5

MR. GOLDSMITH:

Those -- those grantees
So, as to them, it is

Well, it's not modified in

6

the same way that AB 1889 modifies it, Your Honor.

7

First of all, under those statutes there is no

8

requirement that funds be segregated.

9

possibility of litigation, treble damages to follow.

There is no

10

There is no possibility of attorneys' fees to the

11

prevailing party.

12

really unique and don't in any way change the basic

13

principle that I think all labor lawyers would agree,

14

and that is that, under the National Labor Relations

15

Act, all parties to a union election or any issue

16

between a union and an employer have the right to speak

17

in a noncoercive way.

18
19
20

So those statutes are, I think, are

JUSTICE BREYER:
speak, speak.

Say:

Speak, go ahead,

Just not on our nickel.

MR. GOLDSMITH:

Well, I think that's clearly

21

what they say, but it's not that simple given the way

22

this statute operates, Your Honor.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

And they also say -- by the

24

way, that you answer this, I'd keep this in mind -- you

25

may be right about it being too much of an
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

administrative burden, the treble damages et cetera, but

2

they've made major concessions here, and they say that's

3

a matter to be worked out on remand.

4

they have to be very careful about inhibiting your

5

speech.

6

And it may be that

So let's go back over those administrative

7

provisions one by one.

8

read it, don't do that now.

9

They are suggesting to us, as I

MR. GOLDSMITH:

If I may respond to both

10

questions, Your Honor.

First of all the notion that one

11

can use your own money, to use the vernacular, and use

12

it to speak, doesn't answer the most basic question that

13

the statute presents, and that is that whether you can

14

or you can't -- and I'll get to that in a moment -- the

15

fact is that California has regulated, used its spending

16

power to make labor policy, something that this Court

17

has made clear, in Gould and various other cases, it

18

cannot do.

19

the end of the case, there are certain employers,

20

certain Petitioners here who are a hundred percent

21

funded by the State.

22

-- when I say "funded by the State" I mean they depend

23

for their income on State programs, let's say -- they

24

have no ability, none, to speak to employees.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But even getting past that, which I think is

They have no ability, as a result

MR. GOLDSMITH:

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

The State has effectively That's not the

State's fault.

4

MR. GOLDSMITH:

Well, the State's argument

5

to that, Mr. Chief Justice, is that that's a free-market

6

choice.

7

not.

They can either do business in California or

And I would refer the Court -

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

business with other entities beside the State.

10

MR. GOLDSMITH:

Well, they can do

They can, Your Honor, that's

11

true, but that doesn't answer the question because for

12

those that -- because of the service that they provide,

13

such as under Medi-Cal, they have chosen to be in

14

business with the State.

15

an election between doing business with the State or

16

giving up an NLRA-protected right.

17

They are being forced to make

JUSTICE BREYER:

That is -

If you have -- you have a

18

park service of the State and have you a hotdog stand

19

there, it runs the hotdogs, it's private, but the State

20

pays for everything.

21

And it happens that, in the grant, they have no place

22

for talking about the union.

23

required to add to the legislation, a special grant, so

24

that the employer can speak of the union?

25

The State pays for everything.

MR. GOLDSMITH:

You're saying they are

Well, a grant presents a
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

slightly different problem.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why?

Why?

Because they

3

say here we are talking about 100 percent money that

4

comes out of the State treasury and all we are saying is

5

use that money for the State purposes, and those

6

purposes do not include talking one way or the other

7

about the union.

8
9

MR. GOLDSMITH:

Well, that may be the case

for a particular program or a particular grant, but

10

that's not what AB 1889 does, Your Honor.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

simple argument is look we are paying for certain

22

things, and we want to get what we paid for.

23

a lot of other things that we could have paid for, but

3

We don't want to pay for union

MR. GOLDSMITH:

That might be an argument

4

that the State could advance credibly if in fact this

5

statute had anything to do with saving money.

6

doesn't.

7

this was not anything that had anything to do with the

8

fiscal issues; it had solely to do with making labor

9

policy.

It

The court below unanimously concluded that

And as far as a facial challenge is concerned,

10

Your Honor, the fact is that this statute was applied to

11

the Petitioners.

12

The Petitioners -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Where did the lower court

13

say it has nothing to do with the State getting what it

14

is paying for and not paying for things it doesn't want

15

to pay for?

16
17

MR. GOLDSMITH:

Well, Your Honor, that's, of

course, my vernacular for -

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

MR. GOLDSMITH:

That in -

-- what the court said, but

20

what the court did say was that the State passed -

21

legislature passed and the governor signed AB 1889

22

solely for labor policy purposes, and that's clear from

23

the preamble to the statute.

24

statute says, it is the policy of the State of

25

California -- in so many words -- that employer speech

2

3

that anything achieved by 1889 saves the State a dime.

4

That's an argument -

5

There's nothing

There's no attempt at all to suggest

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So it would come out -

6

it would come out differently if the statute has said,

7

we want to get what we pay for and we don't -- we choose

8

not to pay for labor relations?

9

MR. GOLDSMITH:

Well, if the State could

10

establish that it was acting as a proprietor, within

11

meaning of this Court's decision in Boston Harbor, and

12

establish as a proprietor that it was doing something to

13

advance a fiscal purpose, then perhaps a statute so

14

worded would survive the pre-emption challenge.

15

that is clearly not what happened here.

16

evidence that that happened, and that is not the purpose

17

or the effect of AB 1889.

18

But

There's no

And as to the facial challenge issue, if I

19

could answer both Justice Breyer and Your Honor, the

20

fact is that this statute was applied to the

21

Petitioners.

22

and they said, this applies to us, it's burden some for

23

us to do -- to do what the statute purports to require

24

us to do.

25

so on.

The Petitioners went into district court

The district court granted an injunction and

10

decided this as a matter of law and NLRA pre-emption

11

12

The legal issue is whether or not the

13

Federal scheme has been interfered with, and I think

14

that any fair reading of this statute makes it

15

abundantly clear that that's exactly what happened.

16

California was very open about it.

17

precisely that:

20

inhibit an employer's ability to speak.

22

interferes with the Federal policy.

The preamble says

We believe that employer speech

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So that they

That's what

Did they say something

24

different from what Congress said in those three or four

25

statutes that were mentioned earlier?
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. GOLDSMITH:

In terms of using the words

2

assist, promote and deter, those words appear in those

3

statutes in that Medicare regulation, or statute,

4

component of the Medicare statute, and those appear also

5

in, in AB 1899.

6

But, you know, again, Your Honor, from my

7

perspective I think, you know, it's clear that nothing

8

in those statutes changed the fundamental policy that

9

speech, free speech, for both employers and for unions

10

is something to be encouraged in the context of a union

11

organizing drive for a number of reasons, not the least

12

of which employees are allowed and entitled to hear both

13

sides of the picture before being put in the position

14

where they have to make a choice.

15

that employer speech is a bad thing.

16

reflection of that.

17

nursing home that participates in the Medi-Cal program,

20

what does this require?

21

22

-- is it the case they can't use any of those funds for

23

union-related speech or just the portion that does not

24

represent profits?

25

They have to segregate the

MR. GOLDSMITH:

They can't use any of those
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

funds.

The notion that profits -- the statute doesn't

2

say a word about profits, and, of course, if the statute

3

were to say something about profits, it would make

4

segregation of accounts problem in the statute even

5

worse than it already is.

6

But what a nursing home has to do is to

7

track every single possible circumstance under which an

8

employee of the nursing home engaged in speech that was

9

designed to assist -- which don't happen very often,

10

presumably -- promote or deter union organizing.

11

And let me try to bring it down to what

12

really happens in the union organizing campaign.

13

is, by and large, a seven-day-a-week, 24-hour a day

14

operation.

15

the course of the union organizing drive that the

16

employer responsible for complying with AB 1899 may

17

never even know about.

18

This

There are any number of encounters during

So, for example, if an employee goes to his

19

supervisor and says union X is trying to organize

20

nursing home, what do you know about union X?

21

22

X is they used to represent the nursing home across the

23

street, and then that nursing home is now closed.

24
25

And the

Now, that may be a purely factual statement,

That's certainly what the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

that no, no.

3

was a statement designed to deter the employee from

4

voting for union X.

5

What the union might argue is

You have to put that in context, and that

Now, if the employer guesses wrong on that

6

issue, that is the employer says, well, this is factual,

7

it's not something designed to deter union organizing,

8

he is subject under the statute to litigation for not

9

having segregated -- and I don't know what he would

really segregate; the statute is unclear.

The Court has identified

several factors that it has used to distinguish

regulatory from proprietary conduct, first and foremost,

In addition, the Court

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

On a case like Rust

promote policy, or is it simply acting in a proprietary

8

capacity?

9

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, of course, that question

10

did not come up in Rust against Sullivan because there

11

was in a NLRA pre-emption issue there, and the question

12

that the State was -

13
14
15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm talking about

spending power versus regulatory power in general.
MR. HUNGAR:

But what the Court did say in

16

Rust is that the government has a legitimate policy

17

interest in advancing its preference for life, in that

18

case, that the Congress was entitled to advance.

19

problem here is that the policy interest that the State

20

is advancing, a policy interest that says employer

21

speech regarding unionization interferes with employee

22

free choice, is a policy that is directly contrary to

23

the Federal policy under the Act as Congress and the

board have repeatedly recognized, and that this Court

has repeatedly recognized.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL GOTTESMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

18

20

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Until this statute was enacted, California

21

was in the anomalous position that it was financing

22

speech on one side of union organizing campaigns but not

23

on the other, because most grants, programs, contracts

24

include employment costs as an allowable cost.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Well, so was anyone

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

who hired a company to do any kind of work, right?

2

Because the Federal policy meant that they couldn't try

3

to restrict what activities the company engaged in with

4

respect to union organizing.

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Yes.

I mean, a private

employer could have said the same things that the State

don't use our money to do this.

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And they would

I'm not sure why you

10

characterize California as financing one side of a

11

debate, because -- and this I think is sort of the nub

12

of the disagreement between the two sides here -- their

13

argument is that a State can determine what it wants to

14

buy with its money, but what California is doing is

15

telling its contractor what it can do with the money

16

after the State has got what it paid for.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Alderson Reporting Company

1

their profits as opposed to determining what they get -

2

what you get for your money.

3

that?

4

MR. GOTTESMAN:

And how do you respond to

Well, that's true if it were

5

the case that the State's statute said:

6

have earned this money by performing all the service we

7

asked, you still can't -- it's therefore now your money;

8

you can't use it.

9

That is -- the State has been very clear about that.

10

Even after you

That is not what the statute means.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, is there any case in

11

which California claims that it has not gotten the

12

service that it paid for as a result of the position

13

which an employer -- a grantee employer took on -- on a

14

unionization issue?

15

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, there haven't been any

16

cases decided under this statute, but what the court of

17

appeals pointed out is that the Petitioners did not move

18

for summary judgment on the ground that you're

19

forbidding us from using our money.

summary judgment solely on the ground that it was the

21

obligation of the State to give them money that they

22

could use for these purposes.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, that's not quite

24

accurate.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and that that

4

Right.

activity was pre-empted.

5

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Right.

Well, yes, on that

6

core issue, they said to -- to tell us that we cannot

7

use State funds for this purpose -- well, they are still

8

State funds -- is to regulate us.

9

that is wrong.

10

And we submit that

This is -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why do you say "while they

11

are still State funds" -- the -- the money that the -

12

that any employer is using, I presume, to the extent

13

that it can be identified, is money in the employer's

14

pocket.

15

it seems to me from the pre-emption argument, is that in

16

fact we are buying a form of speech or a form of

17

promotion of labor policy when we contract with social

18

service agencies or whatnot.

19

that to be California's argument at all.

20

And the only claim that California would have,

MR. GOTTESMAN:

But I don't understand

No.

Our argument -- let's

21

take one of the two provisions that the district court

22

struck down, and that Petitioners argue properly struck

And that's true universally.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but if they give them

3

grant money -- let's say it's a grant rather than a

4

contract, and I assume that's, you know, the point

5

you're making.

6

assume they're giving them grant money in order to do or

7

to perform whatever kind of service or function the

8

agency is devoted to performing.

9
10

When they give them grant money, I

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Correct.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Not to -- not to enforce

11

labor policy of one sort or another, but to promote the

12

arts or conservation or whatever the organization does.

13

And there's no argument here that the organization is -

14

is failing to promote conservation or the arts or

15

whatever, and that for that reason, California isn't

16

getting what it's paying for.

17

whatever California has to -- I'm sorry, whatever the

18

organization has to spend, say, on its labor relations,

19

which is something that is left over from its promotion

20

of the arts, cannot be spent except in accordance with

21

California policy.

22

MR. GOTTESMAN:

The argument is that

Well, first, if they don't

23

spend all the grant money on the prescribed purposes,

24

they have to give it back to the State because grants

25

aren't profit 30

entitled to some overhead cost which would include the

11

Right.

And that's -

So that wouldn't be money

That would MR. GOTTESMAN:

Right, but that, Your Honor,

is where the concern that the State was addressing comes
in.
Traditionally, when the State gave grant

12

money, one of the permissible uses of that money was for

13

the costs of employees who had to perform the grant, and

14

without this limitation, that would have included the

15

employer spending the money to combat unions.

16

would be -- could arguably be a legitimate cost.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That

So, is the argument that

18

the employer in fact -- that the employer is in fact

19

devoting less of the grant money to the purpose of the

20

grant, so that it falls within Rust?

21

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well -- yes.

Well, our

position is certainly yes.

whether that is a policy that California can -- can

policy, and the preamble to the statute does not say:

No, but the policy

-- the policy is they don't want employers to talk about

3

MR. GOTTESMAN:

No.

They don't want them to

spend them the employer's money -- the State's money to

talk about unionization.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

the money or because that is their -

Why?

Because the State wants -

MR. GOTTESMAN:

-- their labor policy?
Because the State wants to

be neutral, and that -- the right -

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then that -- then that, it

13

seems to me, cuts the feet off your argument of a moment

14

ago, that in fact the State's concern is that it's

15

getting less of what it thought it was getting for with

16

its grant, because more is being spent on labor policy.

17

And now, it seems to me, you're saying no, that's not

18

the case.

19

employer spends in talking with employees, whatever the

20

subject is, involves a policy that California does not

want to support, and, therefore, California prohibits

them spending that time for purely policy reasons.

It is simply the fact that the time that the

It would be very odd to believe -- and

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Gottesman, can I ask

sort of a background question to be sure I understand
your position?

11

Am I correct in assuming that if the State

12

of California had its labor relations agency make it an

13

unfair labor practice to engage in this employer speech

14

described here, that that would be pre-empted?

15
16

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Employer speech with its own

money?

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

18

MR. GOTTESMAN:

19

Yes.
Of course that would be

pre-empted, absolutely pre-empted.

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

21

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Okay.
If not pr-empted, it would

22

certainly be a violation of the First Amendment as well,

23

to punish them for engaging in speech.

Well, if they adopted the

rule that the Federal labor board applied prior to the

MR. GOTTESMAN:

That's what I'm asking.

Yes.

That would be pre-empted?
Of course that would be

pre-empted.

8

JUSTICE STEVENS:

9

MR. GOTTESMAN:

I want to be sure.
Our position, however, is

10

that it's quite different to say that the National Labor

11

Relations Act requires the State to pay for these

12

activities.

And -

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Why -

It does require that this

15

-- it arguably requires that this area of combat between

16

labor and management be unregulated.

17

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Right.

And this is not

18

regulation, for the very reasons that this Court in

19

Regan and Rust and in a whole line of cases had said

20

that it is not regulation to simply say, we the

21

government are not going to pay for this activity.

22

That's all that California is saying in this

23

case:

we are not going to pay for it.

of the State not to interfere in these union organizing

It's the policy

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think your reason for not

paying for this activity is that you don't like this

activity.

MR. GOTTESMAN:

That's not true.

There's nothing in this preamble -- the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you allow the

thing the employer can't do is speak out against the

This isn't because you don't MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, you've got for or

MR. GOTTESMAN:

It just takes the State's

a practical matter, on the view that there are at least

some employers who would be arguing in favor of

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, it wouldn't matter if

they were arguing for or against.

The point is that -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, but my point is

that there are precious few who argue in favor of it.
MR. GOTTESMAN:

Right.

Well that may well

13

be true, but the point is when they are arguing against

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Let me just be clear.

The

20

statute with reference to State contractors, which is

21

the $50,000 statute, and the statute with reference to

22

private employers, which is the $10,000 statute, in all

23

of those cases, the law is applicable only if the money

24

is paid before all the work is done?

25

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Yes.

If you look at the

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

contract one, which is not actually before the Court

2

because nobody had standing -- the district court ruled

3

to raise it -- it says the State funds to assist,

4

promote or defer -- union organizing during the life of

5

the contract are not to be spent on this.

6

So once the contract is done, that is -

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, the question of when

8

the contract is done is different from the question of

9

when the money is paid.

10

MR. GOTTESMAN:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

Of course.

Right.

He is asking with when the

money is paid.

13

MR. GOTTESMAN:

So when you pay the money up

14

front and you say here is your money to do the

15

contract -

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, what about the

17

situation in which the contract runs for a year and you

18

bill monthly?

19

going on and yet there is no prepayment.

20

your argument they would be just as bound by the

21

California policy as if they got a hundred percent

22

payment up front.

23

On your theory the contract is still

MR. GOTTESMAN:

I assume on

Well, that's -- that's a

24

question about a meaning of a provision that isn't at

25

this issue in this case.

The ones that are at issue in
43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

this case -

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, do you concede that

3

if they -- if all they did under a 12-month contract

4

was -- was bill for services rendered every past 30

5

days, that there would be either no application of the

6

California law or that the application would be

7

pre-empted?

8
9
10

MR. GOTTESMAN:

But we don't have an interpretation of that provision of
the California law.

11
12

That might well be the case.

JUSTICE ALITO:

I'm sorry.

That was an

either/or.

13

(Laughter.)

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Which might be the case?

15

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Oh.

16

I say it might be the

case.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MR. GOTTESMAN:

MR. GOTTESMAN:

It's like saying yes.
Yes.

But again, that issue isn't

21

here.

the State advances the money, and some of which it pays

after the services have been completed.

10

to 27:

has provided the State with a service the State has

13

The State maintains a legitimate interest in

JUSTICE BREYER:

So if you sell them tables

15

and they write you a check, the State, for the tables,

16

at that point the check is yours?

17

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Of course.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. GOTTESMAN:

All right.
There is no question about

20

that, because in that case, that would be covered by the

21

contract provision that isn't here.

22

the contract is completed, it's your money.

24

But it says once

use our money.

warranty for another year, say if these tables break you

2

have to replace them?

3

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, that's a question

4

of -- remember, neither of the lower courts has

5

interpreted this statute.

6

interpreted.

7

said is that's because the argument that you all have

8

been asking me about was not raised in summary judgment

by the Petitioners.

This statute has never been

That's -- and what the court of appeals

Their core argument is the State

10

has an obligation to subsidize our speech.

11

the only issue they brought up on summary judgment.

12

Because Judge Beezer in the panel decision said, oh,

13

look at all these, quote, as he called them, horribles

14

that will come from this, Judge Beezer got into all

15

these issues:

16

it's going to be the employer's own money.

17

And that's

The accounting would be burdensome, that

And what the majority said is, number one,

18

that's not here.

And number two, they said this -- I

19

believe it's on page 34 of the appendix but I'm not

20

certain of the -- wait a minute, I can tell you the

21

exact page.

22

horribles goes far beyond the scope of plaintiff's

23

facial challenge, that is the challenge they brought on

24

summary judgment.

25

nor is there evidence that this statute, quote, "co-ops

as to -- we've heard today, too, in the briefs it's

there, I put the thing that I've heard as -- well, the

All those things could be problems, and you

14

say, well, they haven't been dealt with yet.

15

recommendation as to what we should do is what?

16

MR. GOTTESMAN:

And your

Is affirm, because all the

17

court has said is the motion for summary judgment was

18

improperly granted.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

would all these problems be worked out?

21

would the arguments that you -- they think are far too

22

burdensome, you think they are not and can be done

23

properly, how does that get worked out?

24
25

MR. GOTTESMAN:

And if we did that, how
I mean, how

Well, first of all, let's

talk about the burdens, the accounting burdens, which
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

are actually quite minimal under Medicaid, because they

2

already have to do this because the Federal Medicaid

3

requires them to -- to account for which were allowable

4

expenditures and which were not in a very detailed

5

accounting form.

6

says that this is not allowable expenditure, so they

7

have to do this anyway, half this money is Federal and

8

half is is State.

9
10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You're not going to go

through all of these one by one, are you?

11
12

And of course, the Federal Medicaid

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Pardon?

No.

I just wanted

to give an example of that.

13

But with respect to each of these, we need

14

to have a record.

an affidavit from an accounting firm submitted by the

16

defendants that says this is really not burdensome at

17

all.

I'm not sure which question

you're asking.

our money -- the same way yours is -- in collective

bargaining with unions or in anything else.

14

not stopping employers from doing that.

15

like unions, and it's our money and we don't want this

16

employer to use it for unions.

Now, we are

We just don't

Would that be all right.

17

MR. GOTTESMAN:

I think that would be

18

problematic but only for this reason.

19

is allowed to spend the State's money to -- to bargain

20

with nonunion employees and you know medical

21

researchers, whatever, negotiate contracts with them,

22

but the State says you can't do it for collective

23

bargaining, then that is exactly the Livadas case.

24

is the case in which the State is saying your

25

entitlement to a State benefit turns on whether you are

If the employer

do this with nonunion employees, but not with unionized

for the costs of negotiating -

5

In this case we'll let the employer

But if the State said we don't want to pay

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why does that -- why does

6

that make a difference?

If it violates Federal policy,

7

it violates Federal policy.

8

it because it violates Federal policy, which is to favor

9

unionization, and not to deter.

10

MR. GOTTESMAN:

11

neither favors nor deters.

12
13

Livadas said you can't do

Right.

But this statute

This statute -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You could say the same

about that other one.

14

MR. GOTTESMAN:

This statute simply says we

15

don't want to subsidize either party, and as a practical

16

matter we are only subsidizing one party in union

17

organizing.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So does the statute I

19

posit.

Just don't use State money.

20

your own money to deal with unions; just we don't want

21

our money used for it.

22

MR. GOTTESMAN:

23

You can use all of

That clearly would be

banned and I don't see why yours is any different.
MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well because -- it would not

be banned if the State had said we don't want you to use

2

State money to negotiate contracts with any of your

employees; that would not be banned.

if they singled out only unionized employees that you're

5

not allowed to use it with.

6

with nonunion employees.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I want to get back

8

to your responses on the procedural costs of the case.

9

You said we don't know what the regulatory burden would

10
11

be with respect to accounting rules.
MR. GOTTESMAN:

Yes.

There is a State

12

disputed facts in the district court on that.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Does it make any

14

difference if the argument is which is what I understood

15

it to be, that you can't regulate at all?

16

simply that you can't regulate so long as it's

17

particularly burdensome, but you don't have the

18

authority to regulate in this at all.

19

MR. GOTTESMAN:

It's not

But our argument is that

20

this is not regulation.

To say that the State money is

21

not going to be spent for this is not regulation.

22

as Regan and Rust says -

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

MR. GOTTESMAN:

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Just

That gets to the -

It just says-

51
Alderson Reporting Company

That gets to the

Official - Subject to Final Review

spending clause question.

We're not -- I mean, we can

2

address that without deciding whether the regulations

3

are particularly burdensome.

4

accounting is not a big problem.

You were saying well, the

5

MR. GOTTESMAN:

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

But it doesn't mean

that it's necessarily spending as opposed to regulation.

8
9

Yes.

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, we are not regulating

whether the employer opposes unions.

What we are

10

regulating is what they do with the State's money.

11

That's the only regulation that's here.

12

don't use our money for this purpose.

13

regulation that's going on is to see whether you use the

14

State's money -

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We are saying
The only

That doesn't seem to

16

me to be responsive to my question.

17

well, we don't know how burdensome a particular

18

regulation is.

19

it's spending or regulation, we don't have to wait to

20

see how burdensome it is if we think you're not entitled

21

to regulate at all.

22

Your point was

If you lose on the question of whether

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, if you say that a

24

used" -

25

to the spending question.

MR. GOTTESMAN:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- is regulation I'm putting that

aside.

5

MR. GOTTESMAN:

I'm having -- the problem

6

I'm having with Your Honor's question is presuming the

7

answer to something.

8

there is a serious prospect of its being pre-emptive,

9

but this is not regulation.

10

The -- if this is regulation, then

Regardless of

11

whether -- regardless of whether it's burdensome

regulation.

13

MR. GOTTESMAN:

we don't have to have further proceedings on whether

But if there is no difference with

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Right.

But the only issue

22

they raised on summary judgment is that to deny us your

money, the State's money, is regulation.

24

position is that to deny you the State's money is not

regulation, any more than it was in Regan, in Rust, in

in disagreement with the Ninth Circuit, and -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So the principal rationale

for the Ninth Circuit's opinion is incorrect in your

view?

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, it's not -- no.

The

19

Ninth Circuit also talked about the First Amendment and

20

got it right.

21

had said what this State is doing is violating the First

22

Amendment, and the Ninth Circuit's response is no,

that's not right.

and the First Amendment cases are clear:

What the Ninth Circuit thought erroneously

is that Boston Harbor had denied it the right to take

that same view, because it thought that Boston Harbor

said that everything is regulation unless it's market

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIS J. GOLDSMITH

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12
13

Thank you, Counsel.

MR. GOLDSMITH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.

14

I'd just like to make a few comments in

15

rebuttal.

First of all, the preamble of the statute

16

makes it absolutely clear as to what the State's purpose

17

is.

18

It says it is the policy of the State not to interfere

19

with an employee's choice about whether to join or to be

20

represented by a labor union.

21

should not subsidize -- and so on.

It's at page 3a of the appendix of the petition.

22

For this reason the State

So clearly the State has a labor policy

23

position.

It's a position as I said at the outset that

24

is completely contrary to that of the NLRA.

25

position is that employers just like unions ought to
55
Alderson Reporting Company

The NLRA's

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have the right to speak in a noncoercive way to their

2

employees.

3

Secondly, it is not our position that the

4

NLRA requires the State to fund activities.

5

position that the NLRA and the decisions of this Court

6

make it abundantly clear that the States are to stay out

7

of this area altogether, period.

8

case whether it is the kind of statute that Justice

9

Scalia was posing a question about, whether it was in

10

effect anti-union or pro-union.

11

They are both pre-empted.

12

It is our

And that would be the

It doesn't matter.

The State has no business making labor

13

policy.

The decisions of this Court, the unanimous

14

decisions of this Court in several circumstances I think

15

make that very clear.

16

that for all practical purposes, the State was

17

regulating by making labor policy.

18

And the Ninth Circuit did find

If I could make two points about neutrality.

19

First of all, the statute is anything but neutral.

20

First of all, the State's policy is not one of

21

neutrality.

22

a position; the position is that noncoercive employer

23

speech interferes with employee free choice, and the

24

statute follows that position.

25

As I just read from the preamble they have

The decision to withdraw funds is not the
56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

same thing as being neutral.

2

reference to the Hyde amendment.

3

Congress withdrew funds from -- from abortion

4

practitioners.

5

California here has made a judgment about noncoercive

6

speech.

7

Your Honor made a
The Hyde amendment,

It was not neutral about abortion.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What about the Lyng

8

case that Mr. Gottesman cited in response to that

9

argument?

10

MR. GOLDSMITH:

And

The Lyng case seems to me to

11

be completely off the point on the pre-emption issue.

12

But there is no question, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice,

13

that Congress can make judgments about what it chooses

14

to fund or not to fund.

15

the States to do whatever they wanted to do by way of

16

funding or not funding.

17

constitutional -

18

That did not open the door to

Lyng addressed a

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, Lyng said that

19

the -- that Congress was being neutral not that it was

20

making a choice on how to spend its funds.

21

understood Mr. Gottesman's point to be that so too,

22

here, California is being neutral.

23

MR. GOLDSMITH:

And I

But California is -- is not

24

being neutral, not just because of what the preamble

25

says but because of the add-ons to the statute if you
57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

will.

California has taken it much farther than simply

2

withdrawing the subsidy.

3

point that you're exposed to treble damages, but then

4

you have minute tracking and segregation of fund

5

details, and California has taken it even one step

6

farther and said on the other hand, if you want to spend

7

State money to facilitate union organizing, that's

8

perfectly fine with us.

9

access to union representatives to property.

California has taken it to the

You can spend money to give
You can

10

use State money to -- to facilitate neutrality

11

agreements of one sort or another.

12

help a union organize employees, that's fine by us.

13

Anything that would

So California is not neutral in the same way

14

that Lyng was neutral, but again I would suggest that,

15

Mr. Chief Justice, that Lyng didn't open the door, any

16

more than Rust or Regan opened the door to the States to

17

make labor policy by granting or withholding moneys in

18

any way that they saw fit.

19
20

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you,

Mr. Goldsmith.

21

The case is submitted.

23

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
