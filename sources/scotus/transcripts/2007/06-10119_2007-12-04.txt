ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. BRIGHT

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. BRIGHT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The decision here of the majority of the

11

Louisiana Supreme Court on remand from this Court is an

12

extraordinary departure from the lessons that this Court

13

taught in its Miller-El decisions.

14

of three overarching errors in that regard.

15

And I point out sort

First, the majority looked at each of the

16

Miller-El factors or some of them, and largely

17

discounted them.

18

struck, they whittled that down to two.

19

disparate questioning, they identified that of the white

20

jurors and Jeffrey Brooks, but they said that counted

21

for the State.

22

didn't.

23

That there were five African-Americans
That there was

And Miller-El clearly teaches that it

They found there was no racial implication

24

in the mention of O.J. Simpson case from the start of

25

the case all the way through, because neither O.J.
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Simpson's race nor Mr. Snyder's race was mentioned.

2

Secondly, there were some Miller-El factors

3

that were not considered at all, not even acknowledged.

4

For example, one of the most powerful ones, the failure

5

to ask any questions of Jeffrey Brooks or Elaine Scott.

6

There are very ambiguous general reasons for striking

7

them.

8

ask anybody any questions you wanted as a lawyer.

They asked no questions.

9

In this case, you could

And then thirdly, when they got to the point

10

of considering them cumulatively, they had now whittled

11

them down to where there was very little to consider.

12

And our position is that what Justice

13

Kimball did, the author of the original decision, who

14

wrote the dissenting opinion, one of the two dissents

15

here, actually did what this Court remanded this case to

16

do, which was reconsideration in light of Miller-El,

17

because when you consider all those factors together,

18

nothing answers the question of or explains them as well

19

as race.

20

You can pick each piece out, each leaf out

21

and you can try to find an innocent explanation for it.

22

But when you stand back and look at it all together -

23

and that's why the court missed the fact that the back

24

strike was racially motivated in this case.

25

It just simply didn't look at these things

JUSTICE ALITO:

Can I ask you about one of

the factors?

MR. BRIGHT:

Sure.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

It's hard to discuss them

6

all at the same time.

What is the relevance of strikes

7

of black lawyers that you don't argue were based on

8

race?

9

relevant in this calculation.

It's hard for me to understand why that's

10

Suppose there's a case where it's perfectly

11

clear that certain strikes were not racially motivated.

12

Let's say the prosecution has the strategy of striking

13

every lawyer who's on the panel.

14

lawyer and it strikes every black lawyer.

15

the relevance of the fact that the black lawyers were

16

peremptorily challenged?

MR. BRIGHT:

It strikes every white

Well, I see.

Then what is

You mean the

jurors happen to be lawyers and they are struck?

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

20

MR. BRIGHT:

That's right.

There's a common reason.

Well,

21

if that's the case and you have considered that in

22

Miller-El, that's a factor for race neutrality.

23

difference here is the reason given for striking Brooks,

24

for example, is he might have a reason to go home -

subject of prosecutorial peremptory challenges.

MR. BRIGHT:

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

5

Yes.
And -- but you don't claim

that three of those strikes were based on race?

6

MR. BRIGHT:

Do you?

Well, no different than

7

Miller-El.

8

prima facie case because it is unlikely to happen by

9

chance.

10

The Court in Miller-El says you look at the

JUSTICE ALITO:

There were a large number of

11

strikes in Miller-El.

12

Could you just explain, if you can, what is the

13

relevance of strikes that you do not even claim were

14

racially motivated?

15

MR. BRIGHT:

This is a much smaller number.

Well, the difference is that as

16

in Miller-El it is unlikely to happen by happenstance.

17

They struck all the blacks they could in this case.

18

There were only five.

19

And the way they went about striking them -- and the

20

context of all this -- it doesn't say that all five of

21

those, that's -- Justice Alito, but that's the classic

22

Batson case where the prima facie case is strong, given

23

the number of people struck, but you zero in on the

24

particular jurors where doing the side by side

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think that's right

that you zero in on the ones as to which you objected.

But you also want to rely on the fact that these other

5

jurors were excluded, and no objection was made to their

exclusion.

reason, a non-racial one, why they were struck.

convincing racial bias.

elements of race here.

going on, so I'm going to challenge -- I'm going to

interpose a Batson challenge with respect to the second

prosecution from giving reasons.

In fact, Mr. Oland,

Mr. Hawkins, and at that point Williams, the senior

12

prosecutor, said, don't say anything.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Stop -

Presumably because

14

no objection was raised as to Mr. Hawkins.

15

is -- the burden is on you to object if you think jurors

16

are being excluded on a racial basis.

17

MR. BRIGHT:

I mean, it

Well, but the only thing we're

18

putting the pattern forward for is step three of Batson,

19

where both Miller-El decisions make it quite clear that

20

if the numbers are such that it is unlikely to happen by

21

happenstance, that's one element.

22

five necessarily were struck on the basis of race.

23

it is the fact that that unlikely event, that five out

24

of five were struck, informs that decision in Batson

2

will say, well, with regards to five and six, then we

3

think those are particularly strong, not with regards to

4

others -- Miller-El did that.

5

They only challenged seven on direct appeal,

6

only challenged six on the habeas corpus case that

7

ultimately made its way to this Court, and this Court

8

only found with regard to two.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Out of -- out of how

many who were struck.

11

MR. BRIGHT:

Ten.

So they only challenged

12

seven of those on -- on direct appeal, six on habeas

13

corpus, and this Court only found Jurors Fields and

14

Juror Ward.

question is not could you consider the death penalty.

through several of the juries.

MR. BRIGHT:

Jurors.

Well 11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And I thought that

2

was -- the point was made by your friend on the other

3

side, was that it was ambiguous as to what option she

4

was saying she could consider.

5

MR. BRIGHT:

Well, I'd invite the Court to

6

look at that.

Because what that starts out with is a

7

question about life.

8

imprisonment.

9

says the death penalty, could I consider it?

And then when Ms. Goff is answered, she

10

could consider it.

11

consider it.

12

Could you consider life

Yes, I

And then everybody says they could

Now, the Louisiana Supreme Court treated

13

this as her saying I could consider the death penalty.

14

That's what they said.

Miss Scott.

16

did you mean when you said I think you could?

17

But here's the other point with

It only took one question:

Ms. Scott, what

I mean that was in Miller-El -- in the

could.

2

MR. BRIGHT:

But Justice Scalia, there's no

3

reason you wouldn't ask them what they meant.

4

that's what the prosecutors did with all the white

5

jurors here -- every single one.

6

reasons they gave for striking her.

13

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE ALITO:

What do we do with the

2

comparisons that you are making now to white jurors who

3

were never brought to the attention of the Louisiana

4

Supreme Court?

5

MR. BRIGHT:

Well, I think Miller-El, again,

6

answers that, because the entire voir dire was before

7

the Louisiana Supreme Court.

8

arguments were made about the -- the disparate

9

questioning of jurors; and also with Jeffrey Brooks,

On remand from this Court

10

where that's also very clear because the reason given

11

for striking Jeffrey Brooks is that he would have a

12

reason to want to go home early.

13

My experience is most jurors taken out of

14

their homes and out of their work, would like to finish

15

their job and go home early.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

I think you have a good

17

argument in comparing him to some of the white jurors,

18

in particular Mr. Laws.

19

MR. BRIGHT:

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

Right.
But my understanding is you

21

never relied on Mr. Laws before the Louisiana Supreme

22

Court.

23

Is that correct?
MR. BRIGHT:

Not Mr. Laws specifically, but

24

you can look at the other people that are mentioned in

25

Justice Kimball's dissent.

Mr. Yeager had something
14

Alderson Reporting Company

coming out on Sunday; he wanted to get home for that.

2

Brandon Burns -

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

But the arguments as to each

4

of them are different.

The argument as to Mr. Yeager, I

5

think is much weaker.

6

he was told you don't have to worry about that, this

7

case is going to be over by Sunday.

8

MR. BRIGHT:

JUSTICE ALITO:

He had one event on a Sunday and

Well So that's quite different

10

from somebody -- it could be quite different from

11

someone like Mr. Brooks or Mr. Laws.

12

MR. BRIGHT:

Isn't that?

Actually the reason they say

13

they're concerned about Mr. Brooks is because he was

14

told, your dean says it won't be a problem.

15

okay.

And he says

No further expression of worry by him.

16

There is, by the other jurors, that were

17

accepted -- they all say on the record I need to get

2

They

It doesn't necessarily

7

Does that additional questioning allay the

8

concern that you would have had at the beginning about

9

the fairness, the potential fairness, of the juror?

10

MR. BRIGHT:

Well, I think you have to look

11

not only at those answers but -- but what the court in

12

Miller-El II said were the side-by-side comparisons.

13

If you're asking the white jurors follow-up

14

questions to determine that, then that, I think, cuts

15

very much against the prosecution and supports an

16

inference of racial discrimination.

17
18

If you basically asked everybody about the
same thing, you can't draw that inference.

19

But the Louisiana Supreme Court said here

20

there was consistent questioning of the jurors about

21

whether whatever their other obligations were, it would

22

interfere with their ability to sit as jurors.

And they go right

on to the next fact.

12

You know, I -- I practiced law for 30 years.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

It sounds like the right

answer to me.

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. BRIGHT:

It wasn't the right question.

17

I've often wondered about that, but I've never

18

articulated it.

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. BRIGHT:

21

And I think most lawyers

wouldn't.

22

There's another point where Williams tells

23

the judge:

Swear all these people to say they've got a

24

valid reason for leaving, and send them all out of here

25

-- swearing people to say something that may be true or
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

may not be true.

2
3

And the judge says:

Well, do I do it

individually, or do I do it in a group?

4

He says:

Do it in a group.

Just have them

5

all swear that they've got a legal reason, a hardship

6

reason, to be excused.

7

And the judge goes right along with it.

8

I think what we see with the judge in every

10

ruling here is four or five words:
it.

I'm going to allow

I'm going to allow it.

11

The judge is not engaged in questioning.

12

Unlike Uttecht v. Brown that Justice Kennedy wrote about

13

last term where you have a judge involved and hearing

14

the lawyers and whatever, that's not present here.

15

So I think that when you look at that

16

factor, you don't have assurance that this judge was

17

involved in a way to make sure that the credibility

18

determinations which were being made -- and the other

19

point I would make is here he's ruling on the Batson

Now, he does rule again on the motion for a

23

new trial.

That's the only time that all of the

24

information, all of the relevant information, is before

25

the judge.

But, there again, all he says is I think the
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

prosecutor's reasons were race-neutral.

2

There is no indication that he went beyond

3

that to consider what Batson said and what Miller-El

says we have to consider, which is all the relevant

5

factors.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Bright, may I ask, in

7

your judgment, was all the reference to O. J. Simpson

8

relevant at all to what is before us?

MR. BRIGHT:

I think it is, Justice Stevens,

10

and I think, even if you don't look at the closing

11

argument, which tells you two important things -- first

MR. BRIGHT:

Well -- and he said Simpson got

away with it.

11

because the verdict in Simpson didn't come down until

after Snyder's crime had been committed.

Snyder couldn't have possibly known that,

Our objection is that when the jury was

disparate acceptance, failure to ask any questions,

racial prejudice infected the selection of the jury.

The evidence is too powerful.

MR. BOUDREAUX:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

15

I had some prepared remarks to begin with,

16

but I think I'd like to go straight into responding to

17

some of the concerns that have just been raised.

18

First of all, concerning Elaine Scott, the

19

lady who said "I think I could."

I think the record is

20

quite clear that she was being asked about considering

21

life imprisonment.

23

times:

imprisonment?"

"It is whether you could consider life

She's the lady who said originally, "I think I

4

could."

So the prosecutor's -

As to life imprisonment or

as to the death penalty?

7

MR. BOUDREAUX:

As to life imprisonment,

8

Your Honor.

As to death, she said "I think I could."

9

When it got to life imprisonment, the full question

10

asked four times, among various -- going down the list

11

-- is when she said -

12
13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Where is this?

I -- 364?

Show me -

14

MR. BOUDREAUX:

Beginning at 364 of the

joint appendix, Your Honor.

16

the question posed is regarding life imprisonment.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

MR. BOUDREAUX:

I just wanted to point out

Right.
She was originally asked the

19

question about the death penalty, and her response was

20

the "I think I could."

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Bright contrasts

22

that with the more probing inquiry with respect to white

23

jurors who said "I think I could," and here there was no

24

follow-up.

25

MR. BOUDREAUX:

That's true, Your Honor.

16

MR. BOUDREAUX:

Yes, sir.

But you see -

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

But you compare him to some

18

of the white jurors, particularly, I think, Mr. Laws.

Yes, sir.

Mr. Laws, like

Mr. Brooks, I think it's good to point out, approached

the bench of his own volition.

2

individuals waited until they -- if they were called and

3

were questioned.

4

the venire were summoned into the courtroom, the judge

5

introduced the staff, read the statutory requirements

6

for jury service, and then they started lining up.

7

one of the people lining up to express his concern, not

8

just about meeting the requirements to be a juror, was

9

"I've got class, I've got" -- and I think it's -

The way the proceedings began, when

Mr. Laws was an
He said -

He did come up, and I think

13

the distinction there, Your Honor, is that like several

I can deal with it."

MR. BOUDREAUX:

Ms. Scott?

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

If you look at the

22

top of 367 and then you look over at 366, the format, I

23

think, is that the prosecutor is posing a general

24

question.

25

and goes around and gets an answer.

And then he poses his question -- or she -

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Here is Mr. Lindey.

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

So they start out with the death penalty.

2

some ambiguous thing at the bottom of 366.

3

prosecutor says, "Mrs. Alvarez -- Ms. Alvarez, you said

4

you could not impose the death penalty."

5

Ms. Goff:

They have
Then the

"Mrs. Goff --

I couldn't hear."

"Yes, I would consider it."

I could consider it.

Yes."

"Mrs. Alvino:

I could.

"Ms.

"Ms.

"Ms. Archonie:

I

I could consider

I could."

Now, that doesn't seem too ambiguous for me

12

-- to me.

It seems that what they're talking about,

13

each of them, is the death penalty because that's what,

14

by the time they got to the top of 367, they were

15

talking about.

Maybe there's ambiguity there.

16

MR. BOUDREAUX:

I don't -

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I haven't noticed in

18

anybody's opinion, so far, making that point that you

19

just made.

20

MR. BOUDREAUX:

I would submit that -- that

21

would indicate ambiguity, Your Honor, that the

22

prosecutor starts off with the life imprisonment

23

question, and then it sort of morphed into a death

24

penalty.

25

But, by the time you get back to Ms. Scott JUSTICE BREYER:

No -- well, there's -- I

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

just read you what it was, so I guess people make up

2

their own mind about that.

3

you can make up your own mind as ambiguous is when this

4

prosecutor met with an answer that he considered not -

5

call it strictly kosher, when he found that, like Mrs.

6

Calligan, she said, "I'm not sure."

7

ambiguous than Mrs. Scott.

8

three pages of additional questioning, and then 26 pages

9

later, he doesn't excuse her yet and he doesn't excuse

10

her until she volunteers, "I could give a verdict -- I

11

don't think I could give a verdict to take someone's

12

life."

13
14

But by -- what I don't think

That's more

And then he goes on, for

And it's at that point that the prosecutor
excuses her.

15

Now, compare that to Ms. Scott, who started

16

out saying "I think I could" and then, as I read it,

17

said "I could."

18

here.

Now, that's the kind of comparison

No follow-up.

At the worst, minor ambiguity.

19

MR. BOUDREAUX:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21
22

Yes, Your Honor.

What -

And a slight hesitation.

Now, what do you say to that?
MR. BOUDREAUX:

One of the weaknesses in

23

some these jurors is a lack of follow-up questions.

24

I think we go back to her original comment, which was so

25

softly spoken that the defense attorney said "I can't

perhaps what she said spokenly not in the transcript is

MR. BOUDREAUX:

In the totality of her

12

responses, the ones that were heard which are on the

13

record and the ones which were not heard which are not

14

on the record, the prosecutor felt that she was weak on

15

the death penalty.

And that on its face is a

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, of course -- sorry.

18

MR. BOUDREAUX:

Well, I would just say that

19

the -- we're talking here with the prosecutor's

20

perception of the juror based on her answers and the the

21

trial court's perception in evaluating the prosecutor's

22

proper race-neutral reasons.

Could someone look at this and say it's to

the contrary?

reason, is there, to think that the trial court was

7

being very critical of the prosecutor's answers?

8

recollection is that, after the O. J. Simpson remark had

9

been made in final argument, that the ultimate

My

10

resolution of that involved the trial judge saying that

11

one reason that was not a racially significant remark

12

was that the prosecutor had neither -- had mentioned

13

neither the race of the defendant nor the race of O. J.

14

Simpson.

15
16

Now that is not a critical mind at work, is
it?

6

MR. BOUDREAUX:

And that, in

Yes, Your Honor.

I would

like to respond to that by pointing out, though, that

the reference to the O. J. Simpson case was based on the

9

factual similarities involving the O. J. Simpson case

10
11

and this case.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Do you believe that, if

12

there had been a white defendant here, the O. J. Simpson

13

case would have been mentioned?

14
15
16

MR. BOUDREAUX:

Yes, Your Honor, and I

believe if the O.J. Simpson case JUSTICE SOUTER:

See, I'd be candid -- I

17

will be candid to say to you, under the -- under the

18

circumstances of the record in front of us, I find that

19

highly unlikely.

20

unlikely, I put significance in the O. J. Simpson remark

21

which even you concede is significant.

22

MR. BOUDREAUX:

And because I find that highly

Yes, Your Honor.

But I

23

think the -- the reason it doesn't fatally infect the

24

proceedings with racism is -- I think the comment would

25

have been made had O. J.

Simpson not been white -- I

think perhaps the comment would have been made had it

2

not been O. J. Simpson but some other high-profile white

3

athlete celebrity; and I think it is appropriate,

4

putting aside for the moment the assurance to the court

5

that he wouldn't mention it -- but it was in response to

the defense counsel's argument.

is significant in Defense Exhibit 2 at trial, what -

the defendant's statement taken several hours later,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

To

Mr. Boudreaux, even

19

if -- even if you're correct that a neutral explanation

was given focusing on the emotional distress, are you -

do you think the prosecutor would have made the analogy

22

if there had been a black juror on the jury?

23

MR. BOUDREAUX:

I think he would have, Your

24

Honor.

I know the contention is that he didn't, but I

25

think the facts are clear on this record that it was not

an appeal to race, but it was an appeal to what was a

2

historical fact, common knowledge among most people in

MR. BOUDREAUX:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

That's correct, Your Honor.
Then he says I'm an

officer of the court, and I'm giving you my word.
MR. BOUDREAUX:

That's correct; and then he

6

believes -- despite his assurances, when the defense

7

attorneys made the argument they made, they were

8

inviting that -- that response.

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, do you -- do you

10

believe that it would have been appropriate at that

11

point for the prosecutor to invoke in his argument any

12

case from any state in which a criminal defendant had

13

unsuccessfully feigned insanity as a reason to decide -

14

for the jurors to decide that this defendant is -- is

15

feigning insanity?

16

MR. BOUDREAUX:

I think any historical fact

17

well known to people would have been fair game.

18

an analogy, remember this situation.

19

instructed, argument of counsel is not evidence; take it

20

for what you think it's worth.

This was the historical

21

reference this prosecutor used:

The facts are similar.

The jury is

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Exactly.

So

He's entitled to

a fair trial without prejudice.

12

MR. BOUDREAUX:

Right.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

So I think you have two

14

instances here.

One is Mrs. Scott, and the other is Mr.

15

Brooks.

16

in the transcript is that he was nervous and unhappy,

17

because he's learning to be a teacher, and he's afraid

18

he's going to miss some student teaching time which will

19

count against him.

And with regard to Mr. Brooks, what I've read

20

MR. BRIGHT:

Yes, sir.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

What it says is the clerk

22

called the dean and the dean said it he won't, don't

23

worry about it, which Mr. Brook is then told.

24

challenged for that reason.

25

it.

But Mr. Laws is not.

He's

He might still worry about
And Mr. Laws is a

1

self-employed contractor who announced to the court, I

2

have a big problem this weekend; two houses are near

completion, the owners are supposed to be moving in; my

4

wife has just had a hysterectomy, she's supposed to be

5

taking care of the children back home, and I -- she has

6

nobody to help.

7

Okay?

He's not challenged.

8

So we're not worried about Mr. Laws worried

9

about his wife and his business which going down -- you

10

know, serious.

But we are worried about Mr. Brooks, who

11

has been told by the dean you have no problem.

12

that's a little bit of a problem to me.

13

MR. BOUDREAUX:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now,

Yes, Your Honor.
If you add them up, we have

15

Ms. Scott we have Mr. Brooks, we have the mention of -

16

and three others -- three others, the only other three

22

All right so, there you are.

MR. BOUDREAUX:

Full

Your characterizations are

23

-- are correct, Your Honor.

I won't dispute the factual

24

allegations, but the key thing to point out there is

25

Mr. Laws said he could make arrangements.
42
Alderson Reporting Company

It is

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

difficult; it's -- the jury duty happens.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

3

What's the difference

between that and "okay"?

4

MR. BOUDREAUX:

I'm sorry?

5

(Laughter.)

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

One says I can make

7

arrangements, and the other is more economical and he

8

says "okay."

MR. BOUDREAUX:

But that -- he said -- I

10

think that's the landscape man, he said, as long as it

11

wasn't a prolonged -- as.

12
13

JUSTICE BREYER:
The dean -

14

MR. BOUDREAUX:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

No, she means the dean.

Oh, the dean -- said no problem at all.

What better arrangement can you want?

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- meaning Brooks.

18

MR. BOUDREAUX:

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Brooks says Brooks says okay.
The difference is between

21

"I can make arrangements" and "okay."

22

MR. BOUDREAUX:

The difference -- difference

23

there, Your Honor, is that Mr. Brooks needs to make

24

these classroom -- undergraduate requirements to

25

graduate.

There's a day that's going to come when he's
43

2

when trial was over.

5

requirements, he was not going to graduate.

6

be a little careful to take it as face value from the

7

judge's law clerk calling the dean who then -- she comes

8

back and says it is a 300-hour observation.

9

obviously wrong.

10

If Mr. Brooks didn't meet his

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And I would

That's

Well, I wouldn't take it at

11

face value if there had been a further question asked of

12

Mr. Brooks saying, are you really satisfied you have

13

nothing to worry about?

14

sure hope I -- I'm able to make that requirement.

15

nobody asked that question.

And he says well, gee, boy, I

16

MR. BOUDREAUX:

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But

Nobody asked that question.
All we have is got is

18

"okay" on the one hand and "I can make arrangements" on

19

other.

20

MR. BOUDREAUX:

We also have, Your Honor, as

far as the question of Mr. Brooks is concerned, a fact

that is not articulated by the prosecutor but which

would be supported by the record.

Well, we -- we have to

6

go -- your -- this is enough of a fact-specific inquiry

7

for any appellate court, even when we go into the

8

allegations that the prosecution did make.

9

Now you're saying we also have to imagine

10

other reasons, which he didn't state were the reasons

why he struck, but which might have been.

that; we're not going to consider them.

He sees what's going

Hawkins?
Why did they strike him?

He seemed to me to be a pretty good juror for the
prosecution.

11

MR. BOUDREAUX:

Your Honor, that's a

12

question I've asked myself; and I can't -- I'm not -

13

you would think on the surface of it he would have been

14

a good juror for the State.

15

clear is that the defense would -- objected to his being

16

excused but didn't make a Batson claim because I don't

17

think they wanted to go there.

18

wanted that juror on their jury.

19
20

What I think is equally

JUSTICE STEVENS:

They would not have
He said he had -

Wasn't he struck before

they back-struck the first black on the jury?

21

MR. BOUDREAUX:

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

23

why they didn't make a Batson objection.

24
25

MR. BOUDREAUX:
that.

I believe so, Your Honor.
So that probably explains

Yes, you're correct about

But I think he would have not -- the jurors 46

the defense perhaps would have struck him.

2

that he had plenty friends who were police officers in

3

this jurisdiction.

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I understand why the

5

defense would have struck him.

6

why the prosecutor -

7

MR. BOUDREAUX:

He testified

I'm trying to understand

Well, we don't know that,

8

Your Honor, because there was no Batson objection

9

raised, and the prosecutor was not called upon to

10

articulate any reasons.

11

On the face of it, he looks like he could be

12

a good juror.

13

trial prosecutor, then and there, made that decision.

14

And I think -

But that's a factual matter that the

When they go back and back strike at that point can the

here's the reasons we're back striking.

The back strike is when is
In and of itself you can't say

It is a challenge.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That was my question.
My problem -- after the

back strike of the first black juror who had been

19

accepted, can they thereafter renew an objection if the

20

jurors two and three, who are accepted on the assumption

21

that there would no -

MR. BOUDREAUX:

I think under Miller-El and

23

related decisions that would be part of the totality of

24

the circumstances.

25

The practical problem -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That wasn't done here.

50
Alderson Reporting Company

That was the point that you made.

2

MR. BOUDREAUX:

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

When the third -- the

4

back strike of Brooks was made, they could have gone

5

back for Hawkins and the others, but they didn't.

6
7

MR. BOUDREAUX:

That could have been argued

evidence for them to make their prima facie case.

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry.

9

There's some ambiguity in your answer.

10

Miller-El says others who were struck can be considered

11

as part of the totality.

12

back and object not only to the back struck juror, but

13

as Justice Stevens points out, to the others who weren't

14

objected to perhaps because there wasn't a black person

15

on the jury?

16

MR. BOUDREAUX:

My question is -- can they go

To give you a yes or no

17

answer, yes.

The practical problem with that is those

18

two jurors having previously been excused, could be on

the way to their office or back to their home.

they refer to their having gone back and having read the

11

12

and a half anyway where they seem to be talking about

13

what happened in a pretrial conference and they refer to

14

that prior review and covered a factor favorable to the

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't remember.
I thought that, in reading

52
Alderson Reporting Company

it, it seems as if they are not, and I was thinking

2

about how a judge can't think of everything.

they're going to think beyond what the briefs tell them,

4

they ought to think of it for both sides, and not just

5

for one side.

6

MR. BOUDREAUX:

But if

You know to be honest,

7

Justice Scalia's comment about looking at the record and

8

saying oh, here is another reason that the prosecutor

9

didn't articulate.

12

was -- Greg Scott was a black juror of peremptory struck

13

by the State.

little weight should be given to the exercise of those

two.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. BOUDREAUX:

Thank you.

In the minute or two I have

17

the Court to consider its recent opinion last June in

18

Uttecht dealing with the deference due the trial court

19

in these types of proceedings -- that was a habeas case

20

-- what the opinion says to require on direct review,

21

and according to the trial court, the deference having

22

been present and not just relying on a cold record, that

23

the Louisiana Supreme Court's ruling should be farmered.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.
-- and this is a Batson

case.

MR. BOUDREAUX:

Right, and it -

Because of our concerns in

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. BRIGHT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

MR. BRIGHT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

13

If I could just say, first of all about,

14

this backstrike, because what we see here is after

15

Elaine Scott is struck, that's State number 6, the very

16

next peremptory strike by the State it, number 7, is to

17

go back and backstrike Jeffrey Brooks.

18

Now, notice that with regard to the other

19

four backstrikes used, two by the prosecution and two by

20

the defense, it's at the very end of the process.

21

literally when they're down to one juror.

22

says, "Do we have 11 jurors?"

23

The defense says, "Is this my 11th strike?"

24

Williams then, "Are we back to 11?"

25

only way the backstrike makes sense really, when you

It's

Williams

And then he backstrikes.

56
Alderson Reporting Company

Backstrike.

So these -- the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

think about it, is to look at the whole jury and then go

2

back and cull out the ones based on a comparison.

3

But once Brooks had kept them from striking

4

Mr. Scott, who as Mr. Boudreaux pointed out, his wife

5

was robbed at gunpoint, said he would testify if he were

6

a defendant in a case and was innocent.

7

Justice Stevens pointed out, Hawkins, who was -- had

8

grown children, engineer, friends in the police

9

department -- these two are not struck -- but then once

And then as

10

Elaine Scott is struck, the third back and the Batson

11

challenge is made, we don't have any use for Jeffrey

12

Brooks anymore, so he's -- the backstrike is used in

13

that way.

14

And I think, again, when you look at all the

15

relevant circumstances, it's pretty clear what was going

16

on here with the acceptance of Brooks at the start and

17

the backstrike -

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you agree with

19

your friend on the other side, that you could have

20

objected both to the backstruck juror and to the jurors

21

to whom you -- with respect to whom you did not object

22

because there was -- the juror that was later backstruck

23

on the jury?

24
25

MR. BRIGHT:

I -- I think yes.

The answer

to that is yes, and I think, if the defense had, we'd be
57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

talking about four jurors here today instead of two.

2

But it doesn't diminish from what the Court in Miller-El

3

called the numbers.

4

by chance, that all five -- all five African-Americans

5

are struck in this case.

6

The fact that it is unlikely to be,

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Although you could have

7

made an objection.

As I understand your opponent, he

8

very helpfully said that they probably would have left

9

the courthouse -

10

MR. BRIGHT:

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

12

MR. BRIGHT:

13
14

They would.
So what could you -

So they're gone.

And so if the

objection had been overruled CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The objection would

15

have afforded the state an opportunity to present the -

16

if there was one -- the non-racial reason THAT they

17

struck the juror.

18

MR. BRIGHT:

But the reason for doing that

19

would be to have the judge not allow the strike and to

20

put that juror in the box and the juror'

21

that, as a practical matter, is not going to work.

22

There's no -

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

gone now.

So

Another reason to do it

24

would be to preserve your right on appeal, to object to

25

those jurors.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It might

Maybe your rule here that

5

-- that we're not going to postulate the worst reason

6

for a prosecutorial strike rather than a good reason

7

when you haven't given the prosecution an opportunity to

8

set forth a good reason.

9

MR. BRIGHT:

10

If I may answer.

That only goes, though -- the only two

11

jurors on the reasons that are before the Court are

prosecutor struck all five, and as Justice Souter points

14

out, you wouldn't have made this argument, I don't think

the race of the defendant, but if there had been black

with an all-white jury.
