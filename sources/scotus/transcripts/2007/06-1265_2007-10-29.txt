MR. DAYS:

Mr. Days?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

8

A clearing futures commodity merchant, an

9

FCM, such as Petitioner, has standing to sue contract

10

markets and clearing organizations of contract markets

11

under Section 25 (b)(1) of the act for their bad faith

12

failure to enforce rules that are required by the act

13

and by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

14

court of appeal's contrary ruling should be reversed for

15

three reasons, because it's contrary to the text of

16

25(b)(1), it ignores the essential rule of clearing

17

FCM's such as Petitioner recognized by the Commodity

18

Exchange Act, as well as long-standing industry rules

19

and practices -- an assessment with which the expert

20

Federal agency, the Commodity Future Trading Commission

21

concurs -- and it's in cross purposes with the goal that

22

Congress sought to achieve in enacting an express

23

private right of action in 25(b)(1) against contract

24

markets, namely to ensure the existence of fair and

25

orderly markets through a system of effective

Exchange Act confers statutory standing on Petitioner to

3

bring this private right of action against Respondents.

4

25(b)(1) makes no reference to buyer or seller but

5

instead confers standing on any person who engaged -- a

person who engaged in any transaction on or subject to

7

the rules of a contract market or licensed board of

The plain language of the Commodity

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Days, can I interrupt

you there, and ask, if you would -

11

MR. DAYS:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- if you would define

13

the transactions -- the particular transactions on which

14

you rely to come within that provision and what rules of

15

the exchange or the clearinghouse do you say was

16

violated?

17

MR. DAYS:

Justice Ginsburg, we view this as

18

several subsidiary transactions that ultimately end in

19

the consummation of the contract, but with respect to

20

the rules that we have in mind -- first of all Rule 6

21

(a) talks about -- that can be found in the blue brief

22

at 1a -- that such contract executed or consummated by

23

or through a member of such contract market.

contract and then, after assuming that contract, has to

clear it immediately, indeed, within one hour.

8

that's -- those are the rules under the statute and with

No contract can be dealt with or entered

So

10

With respect to the clearing

words, the contract is between a clearing FCM on one

19

side of the contract and a clearing FCM on the other

20

side of the contract.

21

the buyer and seller, but before that happens, it's

22

clear that the clearing organization views the clearing

For the Court of Appeals to talk about buyer

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

MR. DAYS:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You think you -

I think You've talked about

12

the transaction, but I also ask you, what were the rules

13

that the Defendants violated, the rules of the statute?

14

MR. DAYS:

Well, it's -- it is clear, as

15

I indicated with respect to the rule of the contract

16

market, that the clearing FCM is required to clear that

17

particular order or contract.

18

point, the clearing requires some information about the

19

settlement price.

20

fraud at the point where the settlement price was set.

21

That then created a problem with the clearinghouse, and

22

at the clearing process there was also a continuing

23

violation because at both points the contract market and

24

the clearing organization should have been applying

25

their rules effectively and carefully, and we suggest

And, therefore, at that

Here the allegation is that there was

6
Alderson Reporting Company

1

here that that was done in bad faith.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

3

MR. DAYS:

I think -

The cause of action, we

4

understand, requires that there be a showing of bad

5

faith.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Is -- I don't want to

7

reduce the issue down to something too simplistic, but

8

is there a rule that says don't lie, don't commit fraud?

9

MR. DAYS:

Yes.

In fact, the -- in order to

10

be a contract -- a market designated by the CFTC and by

11

the statute, there has to be a commitment to avoiding

12

price manipulation and cornering the market or various

13

other things of that kind.

14

and it's also subject to the rules of the CFTC.

15

a basic understanding.

16

respect to the whole question of settlement prices and

17

margins, the understanding of those who participate in a

18

commodity futures market is that they will establish

19

their margins with the expectation that those rules will

20

be applied fairly and firmly and in good faith.

21
22

That's a given.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's

Indeed, with

Am I -- am I right that we

really do not have to -

23

MR. DAYS:

Am I correct that we really

do not have to determine that issue this morning?

MR. DAYS:

What -

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All we have to determine is

3

whether it is possible for the Petitioner here to be

4

within the class of those with standing?

5

MR. DAYS:

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

7

MR. DAYS:

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

Absolutely.
Yes.

This is a standing case, sir.
Mr. Days, suppose

that the exchange has a standard sort of

10

nondiscrimination provision with respect to employment

11

practices, and it -- an employee asserts that she was

12

discriminated against in the promotion review.

13

she be covered by this provision?

14

MR. DAYS:

No, Your Honor.

Would

I think that

15

Congress had in mind a limitation of the standing

16

position -- that is standing -- a right to those who

17

participate in the process, when it talks about a person

18

who engaged in a transaction on or subject to the rules

19

of the contract market -

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I suppose the

21

transaction would be her annual employment review that

22

she alleges violated the exchange rule saying the

23

exchange would not discriminate on the basis of sex.

24

contract, would be carried out on or subject to the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But suppose, to narrow

6

that hypothetical, that there's a rule that you can't be

7

an employee of the clearinghouse or the exchange if you

8

have a conviction for fraud, and they don't -- they're

9

negligent and careless about enforcing that rule and

10

that fraud causes the loss.

11

the government's theory, would there be liability, and

12

is there a difference between those two theories?

13

MR. DAYS:

Under either your theory or

Well, the statute itself talks

14

about the responsibilities of the contract market or the

15

clearing organization.

16

and transactions are described broadly but not in a way

17

that would encompass the examples that you gave, Justice

18

Kennedy.

19

And it describes transactions,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -- so, the

20

transaction has some substantive limitation that is

21

derived from where?

22

MR. DAYS:

Well, it's derived from the

23

statute, if one looks at Rule 2(i) in the statute.

24

describes transactions in a variety of ways.

25

in any of the appendices, but it can be located, I

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Theoretically,

Well, why aren't

21

these ancillary rules?

When I think of a futures

22

exchange market and the transaction, I think of the

23

buyers and the sellers, you know, the longs and the

24

shorts, and this strikes me as just kind of the

25

paperwork in the back office.

Why is that, why should

10
Alderson Reporting Company

we assume that's covered by the term "transaction"?

2

MR. DAYS:

Well, it is a broad definition,

That's correct.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can I ask you -- I find it

13

difficult -- I'm finding it difficult to follow the

14

exact language on page 4a of the appendix, of (b)(1)(C).

15

To you, that's probably the key provision, right?

16

that's in the blue brief.

here it says "a clearing organization."

Now, a clearing

JUSTICE BREYER:

The clearing organization

got all mixed and it all -

3

MR. DAYS:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, they're liable for

5

actual damages to a person who engaged in a transaction

in a contract market.

7

That's what it says.

MR. DAYS:

9

And the

Not the clearing

organization.

11

MR. DAYS:

Yes.

And they're liable to that

13

person for the actual losses that resulted from his

14

transaction in the futures exchange --- as such

15

transaction.

16

MR. DAYS:

Yes.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what your claim -- they

18

were caused by the failure of the clearinghouse to

19

follow its rules.

20

MR. DAYS:

Yes, sir.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

If they just read that, we

22

have a case where the clearing organization didn't

follow its rules the -- my client engaged in a

24

transaction over the futures exchange.

25

MR. DAYS:

Yes.
12

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE BREYER:

And it was caused harm

2

because the clearing organization didn't follow its

rules.

correctly?

9

Yes.

10

Breyer, whether you're heading toward the concern that's

11

expressed by the Respondents, namely that 25(b)(1) does

12

not contain in that second part of the statute a

13

reference to a -

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MR. DAYS:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- clearing organization.
I know, but then the

response I'm going to ask them is, so what?

18

MR. DAYS:

Well, I think that is -- "so

19

what" is a proper response, I'm glad you said it rather

20

than I, that -

21
22
23

JUSTICE BREYER:

I know you're going to -

but I MR. DAYS:

We have -- we have, we think,

24

standing with respect to a transaction that occurred on

25

the contract market even if the Respondents' argument is
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

persuasive that it didn't happen on the clearing

2

organization or subject to the rules of the clearing

3

organization.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It would be an argument

5

for this case because that absence has been cured.

6

Wasn't that in the 2000 amendment that -- that they

7

changed the -

8

MR. DAYS:

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

That's correct.
-- the list to registered

entity and which does include clearinghouse.

11

MR. DAYS:

Yes.

Well -

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

MR. DAYS:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -

Yes?
The concern on the

15

other side, I take it, is that it's not just limited to

16

transactions on the exchange, but transactions subject

17

to the rules of a contract market.

18

you, in response to the hypothetical that Justice

19

Kennedy posed, that you indicated that transaction has

20

some substantive limit to it, and if that's the case,

21

which seems to me an awfully large concession, then we

22

have to figure out what the limit is.

23

me that it could just as easily be limited to the

24

transaction between buyers and sellers of futures

25

contracts as between all these subsidiary, ancillary,
14
Alderson Reporting Company

And I understood

And it seems to

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

collateral, whatever transactions that simply implement

2

that broader transaction.

3

MR. DAYS:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there

4

are limitations with respect to 25(b)(1).

5

indicated, nonparticipants in the market are not

6

explicitly covered by this, but also one has to

7

understand that there has to be a showing of bad faith

8

and there are no punitive damages.

9

damages and, therefore, this limits the extent to which

10

this provision can be used by someone who is not within

11

the category that I described.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

As I

There are actually

Correct me if I'm wrong,

13

but you're going to be more favorable to this than I

14

expect your opponent.

15

linguistically or otherwise wrong if you had a statute

16

that said people in the badminton court have to play

17

carefully.

18

merry-go-round, they are liable.

19

I mean, there is nothing really

And if they hurt somebody on the

And so people in the contract market have to

20

play carefully, and if they have hurt somebody over at

21

the futures exchange, they are liable.

22

But it says those people in the futures

23

exchange are people who engage in a transaction on the

24

futures exchange.

25

MR. DAYS:

Yes, sir.

And so they said well, by
It was the -

Your point, I take it, is -- well that's

6

true, but my client did something, he guaranteed that

7

commodity transaction in accordance with the rules of

Yes.

industry is that it is the clearing FCM who is always at

4

the center of this, the essential participant in this

5

entire process.

6

I think what is clear about this

The FCM's may not know who the customer is.

7

They certainly don't know who the customer is on the

8

other side.

9

customer is, or the investor is.

The clearinghouse doesn't know who the

No.

the market is about investors.

14

15

FCM's may or may not be covered by the language of the

The one -- the contract market

18

Alderson Reporting Company

the transaction is the process of assuming this contract

2

and then going toward the clearing -- clearing

3

organization to clear it, and it's the clearing

4

organization, setting the settlement price, which really

5

dictates what happens on the clearing organization.

it's the setting of the settlement price which is the

key point.

The transaction does not

require two parties?

12

So

Well, there are two parties here.

transaction?

one sole transaction, as one transaction with a number

of subsidiary activities along the process between

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONER
MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
For purposes of this case, the Court may

15

assume that the word "transaction" in Section 25(b)(1)

16

is limited to the purchase and sale of futures and

17

options contracts.

18

The Court may also assume that, in order to

19

engage in such a transaction, a person must be a

20

necessary and direct participant in the transaction.

21

Even under those -

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Where -- where do

23

all of those assumptions come from?

25

language would be a significant concession in this case.

I mean MR. STEWART:

When I say "assume," I am

3

saying that the Court need not decide at this point how

4

far, if at all, beyond the core transactions that occur

5

on contract markets the statute breaches.

respect to the hypothetical case of an exchange or a

7

clearinghouse that has an anti-discrimination rule and

8

is alleged to have violated that rule.

That is, with

Yes, on the one hand, you could say that in

seems very far afield from what was the core of

Congress's concern.

the argument that there is a different Federal statute.

On the other hand, I think there is

out what was the core of Congress's concern and limit

MR. STEWART:

I think the Court can at least

21

start from the assumption that Congress referred to

22

transactions on, or subject to, the rules of the

23

contract market.

24

posited in the hypotheticals, the anti-discrimination,

25

would be transactions on a contract market.

And none of the things that have been

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But they would be

subject to the rules of the contract market.

3

MR. STEWART:

They would be subject to the

4

rules.

But our point here is that the United States and

5

the CFTC have not had occasion to decide how far, if at

6

all, beyond the core transactions on the contract market

7

the statute extends.

8

But our point is, even if we look at the

9

core of what Congress was driving at, the buying and

10

selling of futures options contracts, the clearing FCM

11

is a proper plaintiff because it assumes direct

12

contractual liability to the clearinghouse.

13

the clearing process is completed, it was defined as the

14

buyer or seller of the contracts in the NYFE rules, and

15

its participation is essential.

Even before

16

Now -- now, we have a somewhat different

17

conception of the relevant transaction than does the

18

Petitioner.

19

trades on the floor of the exchange, he set in motion a

20

process that would quickly and inevitably culminate in

21

the clearing of the trades by the clearing organization,

22

and at the end of the day there would be an array of

23

contractual relationships.

And there would be a

What about the argument

8

that if we accept your view of it, allowing the FCM to

9

sue, then there could be multiple liability?

10

MR. STEWART:

I think that's incorrect.

I

11

think the customer would also be an appropriate

12

plaintiff, that is, the customer would have his own

13

rights and obligations arising out of the -- the

14

contract with the clearing FCM.

15

16

they could both recover in the same case.

24

So it's the person who bears the actual loss

25

So if the customer here, Eisler and

But Klein wouldn't be able to

plaintiff.

2

And the fact that in some cases that might

3

be the customer and in other cases it might be the

4

clearing FCM doesn't mean that there would be

5

duplicative recovery in a single case.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, when you began by

7

saying we could begin -- we could assume certain things,

8

was it included in the things that we could assume -

9

was it the proposition that the transaction was limited

10

to a purchase or sale?

11

MR. STEWART:

A purchase or sale, although

12

we would extend -- I mean we would interpret the

13

clearing process as part of the purchase or sale.

14

the reason we would do that is that clearing occurs

15

inevitably by operation of law, as it were.

16

once Eisler executes his trades, Klein has no discretion

17

as to whether to discharge its obligation to clear the

18

trades.

19

And

That is,

Klein had previously entered into a

20

commitment to guarantee the trades that Eisler made.

21

And, therefore, what -- Klein's obligations to the

22

clearinghouse followed directly and inevitably from the

23

initial trade on the floor of the exchange.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is that different from

saying under the exchange rule the FCM is actually the
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

party that enters into the trade.

2

MR. STEWART:

I think it is a different

3

thing and there are two different bases on which the

4

Court could rule in our favor, that is, Rule 306(i)(2)

5

of the rules of the exchange that were in effect at the

6

time of these trades specified that -- and that's

7

reproduced, I guess, at page 14a of the blue brief.

8

it said -- a second sentence of Rule 306(i)(2) says

9

every such contract when made by a trading member shall

And

10

be made on behalf of a clearing member, who shall be the

11

buyer or seller of said contract on the terms set forth

12

therein.

13

So one way to rule for Klein in this case is

14

to simply say even if we focus entirely on the moment at

15

which the trade was executed, under the rules of the

16

exchange, Klein was deemed to be the buyer or seller.

17

But we are also making the different argument and in a

18

sense we think the more important practical argument,

19

that regardless of where the contract ran during the

20

brief period before the clearing process was

21

consummated, the salient factor is that at the

22

conclusion of the clearing process, the clearinghouse

23

would look directly and only to Klein for satisfaction

24

of any obligations arising out of unsuccessful trades.

25

In a sense the clearinghouse could be
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

analogized to a department store in which only the

2

clearing members have charge accounts.

3

anyone else to make a purchase, he has to make

4

prearrangements with a charge account holder to have

5

permission to charge things to his accounts.

6

essentially what was done here.

7

execute trades on the floor of the exchange, he had to

8

have the prior commitment from Klein that Eisler would

9

be allowed to charge trades to client's account.

10

And in that situation, we think it's

And in order for

And that's

In order for Eisler to

11

entirely natural to say that Klein engaged in the

12

transaction, even though Eisler was making the decisions

13

as to exactly what trades to execute.

Mr. Stewart Is that why the Second

their trades are successful, they will get paid.

To answer a variant of it, I

think there could be cases in which both the customer

16

there is a loss of a million dollars that's attributable

17

to malfeasance by the exchange, and the customer comes

18

up with half of that money -- $500,000.

19

clearinghouse uses that to discharge half of its own

obligation to the clearinghouse.

21

That is, say

And the

Now, in that case, both the customer and the

Our point is that there is no danger that

If the Petitioners claimed in their opening

No, Your Honor.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

2

MR. PINCUS:

Or which is subject to.

Well, Justice Kennedy, I think

3

what Congress was explaining there is it wasn't saying

4

any transaction subject to the rules of a contract

5

market, because that would be all of the Court's

6

hypotheticals and discrimination and everything else,

7

and the word "on" wouldn't be there.

8

"on", which by definition "on" has to be subsumed in the

rules because if a transaction is on a contract market,

And so by using

surely is in some way governed by a rule.

11

So if Congress meant to cover every

12

transaction that is in any way governed by a rule, it

13

wouldn't have had to include "on."

14

So the reason -- the fact that "on" is there

The fact that

3

Congress put "on" in there and then followed it with

5

you're subject to the rules of the contract market.

6

MR. PINCUS:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

But I

7

think the reason that "on" is there is that Congress was

8

signaling that it wasn't, that the second part of the

9

clause or "subject to the rules" didn't literally mean

10

or subject to any rule, because if it literally meant

11

that, there would have been no reason to include "on."

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This is like ejusdem

14

"subject to the rules" in the same light that we

interpret "transaction"?

16

You're saying, we should interpret

MR. PINCUS:

No.

This is an argument that

subject to the rules is a special kind of transaction.

It's a term of art in the statute, and a term of art

for example a he contract was made at the pit, and for

some reason the -- the clearing member who was to clear

the transaction went bankrupt that day and didn't exist,

the seller, who by the way are normally represented by

21

clearing-houses by Klein, or by brokers like Klein, but

22

in this case apparently they weren't -- they make the

transaction in the pit and then the rules of the

exchange say that the clearing-house has to pick it up,

that person -- the clearing member, the broker, I guess,

that word transaction covers that entire process.

there are rules in there.

10

is there for taking that word transaction, cutting out

11

about two-thirds of the important event, ignoring the

12

fact that it is covered by the rule of the future

exchange, and limiting it to the physical moment when

14

somebody enters the pit in an unusual case and says "I

15

buy for" -- and then another person says "I sell for"?

16

MR. PINCUS:

Well, let me first point out,

17

Your Honor, it's not an unusual case.

There frequently

18

may be a case even where -- either where -- even where

19

both sides are represented by floor brokers, where the

20

floor broker who is -- who is representing the party in

21

the trade is not the clearing member.

member doesn't have to even be designated until one hour

The reason for the division is that Congress

discuss in our brief, particularly in defining the

6

functions of floor trader and floor broker.

7

The transaction it referred

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Pincus, if your view

8

were correct it would have been so easy for Congress to

9

say "buyers and sellers" or even "trade," but it used a

10

word "transaction" that you say has a special meaning in

11

this context, but "transaction" appears all through the

12

law and usually it's a term that has encompassing

13

meaning, like in the Federal rules "any transaction or

14

occurrence," and you would say that Congress has given

15

it here this very constrained meaning.

16

MR. PINCUS:

We do say that, Your Honor.

17

Because -- let me address first your question about why

18

Congress couldn't use buyer or seller.

19

had to -- needed a construction that would link the -

20

the transaction that was being targeted with the rules

21

of the -- of the contract market, because that was going

22

to be the test here, was it's all about whether or not

23

contract market violated its rules, and so it needed a

24

construction that referred to a transaction because

25

those are the things that are governed by the rules of

the contract market that might be misapplied in the

2

work -- in the way that A, B and C talk about.

3

So it would have had to -- even if it had

4

used the phrase, you know, "purchased" or "sold," a

5

commodity for future delivery or an option on a contract

6

for future delivery -- it would still have to say on or

7

subject to the rules of a contract market, in order to

8

link back to what it was doing, which was creating a

9

cause of action for the violation of the contract

10

markets own rules with respect to a transaction that was

11

subject to those rules.

21

MR. PINCUS:

23

would have to say buyers and sellers there as well.

MR. PINCUS:

Well, it would be referring

2

back to buyer or seller.

But I think the key here is

3

for Congress, given the structure of the act, "any

4

transaction on or subject to the rules of the contract

5

market" is -- are these transactions.

6

only transactions that -- that meet that test.

7

are the transactions, that very same phrase is used in

8

defining the functions of the floor broker and the floor

9

Those are the

MR. PINCUS:

Let me -

There is no definition

Well, there is no definition of

transaction, Your Honor, but in the definitions of floor

17

trader and floor broker, the phrase "on or subject to

18

19

defining what they do, and so those are the people who

20

are at the pit, either executing for their own account

21

6

7

He is just making a deal

It seems to me that that -- that was

MR. PINCUS:

Well, Your Honor, if that was

8

all the Second Circuit said, I would agree with you that

9

would be wrong, but the Second Circuit recognized that

10

the -- Klein here had a risk, a credit risk because it

11

had backed up the credit of its customer, Eisler, and

12

that's why in the lessons learned report that the CFTC

13

14
15
16
17
18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
It's every FCM.

But it's not just Klein.

That is the job of an FCM.

MR. PINCUS:

That is the job of the clearing

member of what an FCM does.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So that's not -- not

19

comparable to just a broker who executes my order for

20

shares and gets a commission for it.

21

MR. PINCUS:

No, Your Honor, but as the

22

Second Circuit went on to note, the fact that there is a

23

credit risk here, that Klein is taking a risk based on

24

the credit of his customer Eisler -- as the CFTC noted,

25

there is nothing in the rules that require clearing
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

members to only accept minimum margin, and it's the job

2

of a clearing member to -- to look into both the

3

credit-worthiness of its customers and the risks of the

4

various transactions that are open and demanding more

5

margin.

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I was under the impression

7

from the briefs, and maybe I'm wrong, that you did not

8

defend the reasoning of the Second Circuit.

9

or wrong?

10

MR. PINCUS:

Am I right

Well, we don't -- to the extent

11

Petitioners claim that the Second Circuit based its

12

reasoning on -- on the imputation into 25(b) of the

limitations in 25(a), we don't agree with that.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, on that subject and

government's position.

2

MR. PINCUS:

Well, it -- it certainly would

3

be better if the phrase "transaction on or subject to

4

the rules of the contract market" meant "trade" and we

5

were only discussing how expansive, how elastic the

6

definition of "trade" was.

7

We would still take the position that it's

8

not elastic enough obviously to include clearing

9

members, but we think that, given the language that

10

Congress used and the fact that that language is used to

11

refer to that "on or subject to" formulation is

12

repeatedly used to refer to trades, we think it's very

13

clear that trades have to be what it is.

14

when the statute talks about the fact that a floor

15

broker engages in activities on or subject to the rules

16

of a contract market, it could be talking about

17

discrimination and all kinds of other activities.

18

even with respect to the narrower formulation urged by

19

the Solicitor General, we think that it is not right for

20

several reasons:

MR. PINCUS:

Our position is, again,

2

the "on or subject to" language, we believe, quite

clearly refers to trades and that Congress's technical

4

correct substitution of registered entities doesn't

5

change that.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But you're saying that

can be on or subject to is a trade.

9

that that -- that's the point at which we have

And it seems to me

10

difficulty following your argument.

11

reason, textual or otherwise, for saying that because a

12

trade is on or subject to, no other subtransaction can

13

be on subject to?

MR. PINCUS:

Why -- what is your

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They have to

But the only one that has

13

this relationship that's different from an ordinary

14

broker, the only one is the FCM.

15

MR. PINCUS:

But that's true, Your Honor,

16

but if the Court were to adopt a rule that says we're

17

going to read "transaction" broadly, and so anyone who

18

has anything to do with any aspect of the trade, either

language, are people who have a role.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But they're not people

who are at risk.

to the first that there are subsequent activities.

There also are arrangements set up with banks that

transactions.

Mr. Pincus -

-- on the rule where we're not

going to know what the answer is.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The -- the agency that's

11

supposed to be the supervisor of this area, the CFTC, is

12

taking the position that the government presented to us

13

today.

14

have just expressed about reaching people who are not

15

themselves subject to the regulation of the exchange,

16

the clearinghouse.

17

Apparently, it doesn't have the concern that you

MR. PINCUS:

Well, I think it does have that

18

concern, Justice Ginsburg, which is why Mr. Stewart said

19

that the Court should sort of take this case on certain

20

assumptions because, as he recognized, the theory that

21

even the government put forward in its brief -

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that what he

23

was telling us was that, even if you assume that Klein

24

has that, even if you've assume that.

MR. PINCUS:

Well, it's certainly their
51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

position that Klein has standing, but in terms of the

2

consequences of a ruling by the Court that the statute

3

goes beyond the core activity, I think the government's

4

suggestion sort of shows that even the government is not

5

sure, once you embark on that exercise, where the

6

boundary line is.

7

is not asking for deference in this case nor could it.

10

And I would point out the government

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think you still

owe Justice Breyer his second reason.
MR. PINCUS:

I do, Your Honor, and the

11

second reason is involved in the government's response

12

to Justice Souter's question about multiple recoveries.

13

If all of these various people can assert

14

claims, then there is certainly a risk, and a

15

significant risk, that all of these various people will

16

assert different kinds of monetary harm that they will

17

claim is actual loss.

18

In this case the principal, actual loss, as

19

we discussed in the second argument in our brief, is

20

claimed as the loss from the destruction, allegedly

21

caused from the destruction, of Klein's business.

22

If there was a bad-enough event on an

23

exchange, all of the people in this -- in the row from

24

ways of protecting itself, as the CFTC report said, in

risk in its customer's portfolio, in terms of -- of

hedging its own risk.

10
11

It's an insider, and it can do

that.
What Congress was concerned with here -- and

12

the reason our construction of the statute makes sense

13

-- is that it protects the outsiders, the PC investors

14

who are at the core of the concern here, without

15

imposing a broad array of liability on the contract

markets, who are in the middle of a huge, huge amount of

financial risk, which really puts them in the position

of shouldering risk that's intolerable.

Mr. Pincus, will you

I -- I understand your

10

argument about what "transaction" means.

11

accept that argument, explain to me again why "or

12

subject to the rules" doesn't add anything?

13

MR. PINCUS:

Well, it does.

But even if I

It adds -- in

14

our construction "the transactions that are on" are the

15

transactions that occur on the floor.

16

that are "subject to the rules" are the ex-pit

17

transactions.

18

The transactions

Once you say "or subject to the rules"

19

involves more than ex-pit trades, off-exchange trades,

20

then you're into the world of the Court's hypotheticals

21

to Mr. Days of anti-discrimination rule.

22

So it has to have a limited meaning; and, by

23

coupling it with "on," we think that Congress made clear

24

it was referring to trades.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why wouldn't it have been

55

enough to just say "transactions on" if that was their

2

meaning?

3

Why did -- did they MR. PINCUS:

Because then you wouldn't

capture a category -- because then Congress would have

5

left out a category of trades.

6

capture investors who trade.

7

of transactions that meet that test:

8

on the exchange, on the -- physically on the pit, and

9

those that are within the industry called off-exchange

10

or off-pit transactions defined in Section 6(c) of the

11

act -- of the -- of the statute.

12

Congress meant to

Those that occur

And so by -- the second phrase is meant to

13

capture those trades that may involve investors but

14

don't occur at the pit.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But I take if -- if your

16

ultimate, let's say, policy reason for confining it to

17

that is the -- is the policy against multiple recovery.

18

MR. PINCUS:

Yes.

The policy reason is the

19

risk of multiple recoveries in an area where there is a

20

huge amount of risk.

21

center of things, of these $5 trillion a day.

22

Congress wrote very carefully, and Congress's focus was,

The rationale JUSTICE SOUTER:

Their current argument is,

basically, that's all Congress was thinking about.

5

MR. PINCUS:

Yes.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But, as I understand your

7

position, it's something more.

Congress was also

8

thinking probably about multiple recovery, and it didn't

9

want that.

And we will impute that intent to Congress

10

because multiple recovery would be a very bad thing for

11

the industry.

That's basically your argument.

12

MR. PINCUS:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

14

MR. PINCUS:

That is our argument.
Okay.

Um, let me say a word about the

15

rules and whether the rules are relevant here.

16

to us that Congress used a phrase in the statute, and

17

that it -- that that cannot be changed by a rule that

18

says -- if an exchange adopted a rule that said some

19

transaction was on, or subject to, the rules of it, that

20

wouldn't be enough to put it into the statutory

21

language.

23

25

The test is what Congress meant.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DREW S. DAYS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
57
Alderson Reporting Company

It seems

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. DAYS:

Your Honors, Mr. Pincus has

2

identified what he views as some temporal gap between

3

the entering into a contract and the involvement of this

4

-- the clearing FCM.

5

That simply is not the case.

Klein had a prior commitment to clear

6

Eisler's trade; so even at the time that Eisler was

7

trading, that had to be done with the understanding that

8

Klein was going to back him up.

9

If one looks at the gray brief at page 21,

10

it references to the rule of Knight -- rules of Knight

11

116 and 118 that make this very clear.

12

we've indicated, that throughout this process the

13

clearing FCM is financially liable and, therefore, is on

14

the hook.

15

The story is, as

When Congress enacted the statute, it was

16

concerned with protecting the public and maintaining

17

credibility.

18

express cause of action for allowing FCMs to sue, is

19

most reliant to the objectives of Congress:

20

faithful execution by an FCM that deals directly with

21

these entities, the clearinghouse and the commodity

22

contract market.

23

We think that this cause of action, this
