ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. RUSSELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents a single important but

12

narrow question.

13

reasonable factor other than age provision of the Age

14

Discrimination in Employment Act, a business practice

15

that is reasonable is not unlawful even if it has a

16

disparate impact on older workers.

17

simply what happens in cases in which the proof on

18

reasonableness is in equipoise, which party bears the

19

risk of nonpersuasion.

20

is not silent such as to leave to the courts to decide

21

for themselves what answer makes the most sense.

22

Everyone agrees that under the

The question here is

And on that question the statute

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is there a hypothetical

23

universe where a scheme that discriminates on the basis

24

of age is reasonable, but there is another alternative

25

that doesn't discriminate on the basis of age?
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Is the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

first alternative still reasonable, or does the

2

existence of a nondiscriminating alternative make it

3

unreasonable?

4

MR. RUSSELL:

This Court made quite clear in

5

City of Jackson that the existence of alternatives,

6

while sufficient perhaps to satisfy Wards Cove and to

7

show a violation under Section 4(a)(2), is not

8

sufficient to show that the action is unreasonable.

9

that's what the Court found to be the case in Smith.

10
11

And
So

the standards are, in fact, quite different.
The reasonable factor other than age

12

provision looks at the reasonableness of the actual,

13

existing practice, and that's where the "because of age"

14

refers to the business practice there.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It doesn't --

If that's true, then is it

16

necessary either on the burden of production or burden

17

of persuasion aspect of the case to consider other

18

alternatives?

19

MR. RUSSELL:

20

order to decide whether there is a --

21
22
23

It is in our view necessary in

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why is it necessary in

light of the answer you gave me at the outset?
MR. RUSSELL:

It is necessary in order to

24

establish whether you even get to the RFOA provision.

25

By its terms -4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

2

MR. RUSSELL:

Whether you even get to --

Even get to it, because by its

3

terms the RFOA provision only applies to conduct that is

4

otherwise prohibited by Section 4(a)(2), and the test

5

for whether something is otherwise prohibited under

6

Section 4(a)(2) is Wards Cove.

7

This Court in Smith said that language,

8

which was identical to the language Congress used to

9

describe the unlawful- employment practice in Title VII,

10

has the same meaning in both statutes.

And in order to

11

establish a violation of Wards Cove, you do have to

12

often look at questions of alternatives.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Russell, this is the

14

problem that I have with your double inquiry.

15

you decide business necessity.

16

reasonable factor other than age.

17

that there is no business necessity, there is a readily

18

available alternative, so what you're left with is a

19

pretext for age discrimination, what -- what function is

20

there for anything else to perform?

21

First,

Then you decide
Once you determine

I mean, I understand the business necessity,

22

whether you have it pre-1991 or post, but I don't

23

understand putting this other test on top of it.

24

sounds like you're making it harder for the -- for the

25

plaintiff.
5
Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, we think that the

2

layering of the tests arises out of the structure of the

3

statute as Congress wrote it.

4

with us, however, and thinks that there is room in the

5

statutory language to treat the language of 4(a)(2)

6

differently in some sense or to apply a different Wards

7

Cove test, then you're still left with the question of

8

who bears the burden of reasonableness.

If this Court disagrees

9

And on that grounds we agree entirely with

10

the EEOC that that question is still determined by the

11

language of the statute, which makes quite clear that

12

Congress thought that this was an exception to liability

13

upon which the employer bears the burden of proof.

14

it made that -- made that clear both by setting the RFOA

15

up as an exception to liability, which this Court has

16

long told Congress will be construed as establishing an

17

affirmative defense absent strong indications of

18

contrary legislative intent, and by sandwiching that

19

defense in the same sentence as two other affirmative

20

defenses, which would be a very strange thing to do if

21

Congress in fact intended the courts to figure out, you

22

know, one of the three is not like the others, That it's

23

intended, instead, as a modification of the definition.

24

And, third, Congress I think it -- it does,

25

and it is telling that, in defining the unlawful
6
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

employment practice, that is in defining the plaintiff's

2

case in chief, Congress used the same language that it

3

did in Title VII, and this Court has never construed

4

that language to require proof of unreasonableness.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, your friend,

6

of course, makes the point that the age discrimination

7

prohibition is narrower in scope than Title VII, that

8

there are more likely to be instances in which a

9

reasonable factor other than age came into play than

10

there would be a basis for discrimination on the basis

11

of race.

12

MR. RUSSELL:

We acknowledge that.

This

13

Court pointed out in Smith that Congress itself

14

recognized that there was a difference between age and

15

other kinds of discrimination; but it took that

16

difference into account not by defining the unlawful

17

employment practice differently, but by providing age

18

discrimination defendants a capacious defense that's not

19

available to any other defendant in a Federal employment

20

discrimination statute, and by in 1991 not extending the

21

modifications to Wards Cove to ADEA plaintiffs.

22

Congress already specifically addressed this

23

question of whether Wards Cove should be adjusted in

24

order to make age discrimination claims harder to prove

25

than Title VII claims, and it agreed that it should; but
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it didn't do it in the way that Respondents suggest.

2

Instead they lowered the bar for Title VII plaintiffs

3

and left in place the Wards Cove test for age

4

discrimination.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Isn't it a strain to say

6

that an employment practice was because of an

7

individual's age, but at the same time was based on

8

reasonable factors other than age?

9

MR. RUSSELL:

10

Well --

JUSTICE ALITO:

Doesn't the latter negate

11

the former or come very close to negating the former?

12

And if that's the case doesn't that suggest that it's

13

not really an affirmative defense but what's necessary

14

to show liability?

15

MR. RUSSELL:

I don't think it does.

We use

16

the example in our brief of a weight-lifting

17

requirement.

18

and quite likely, that it will have a disparate impact

19

on older workers because of their age.

20

be felt by workers because of their age.

21

time, it is quite possible that that practice itself

22

will be entirely reasonable.

23

between what the "because of age" refers to in the two

24

different provisions.

25

It's quite possible for that requirement,

The effect will
At the same

And the difference is

So if you look on page 3 of the blue brief,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

you have the language of the RFOA provision, and the

2

reasonable -- the "factors other than age" refers to in

3

that case the differentiation, that is the business

4

practice itself.

5

page 1A and look at the language of (a)(2), the business

6

practice, that is, the limiting, segregating, or

7

classifying, doesn't have to be because of age.

That is, the employee has to

And the way that you do that is through the

14

first step of the Wards Cove analysis, by showing that

15

the practice falls more heavily on older workers as a

16

group, so that you can reach the conclusion that the

17

plaintiff is feeling the effect because of her age as

18

opposed to because of her sex or some other reason

19

specific to her.

20

RFOA negates the showing that a disparate impact is felt

21

because of age by the plaintiff.

22

So it's not the fact that a showing of

As we were -- as I was mentioning before,

23

the language of the statute we think strongly points in

24

favor of an ordinary reading of this as an affirmative

25

defense.

The Respondent's principal objection is that
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this doesn't give adequate weight to the differences

2

between age and other forms of discrimination.

3

mentioned, we -- we do think that Congress took that

4

into account in a different way, and there is, we think,

5

quite an important value here in providing Congress

6

clear rules of interpretation so that it knows when it

7

enacts statutes using a particular formulation the

8

courts will construe it in an ordinary way, absent some

9

compelling indication to the contrary.

But as I

10

We recognize, of course, in Betts that this

11

Court found such a compelling counter-indication in the

12

legislative history of that statute, and in the -- the

13

law's traditional treatment of benefits -- retirement

14

benefits and seniority rights.

15

point to any kind of similar showing in this case that

16

Congress would have intended this catch-all provision to

17

mean something other than what it seems to say.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But Respondents can't

The expression comes from

19

the Equal Pay Act, with a substitution.

In the Equal

20

Pay Act it's "any other factor other than sex" and here

21

it's "a reasonable factor other than age."

22

impression is that that formulation in this Equal Pay

23

Act has been rather problematic.

24

find there is a differential between the pay of men and

25

the pay of women, so -- and then you go to any other

And my

First, you have to

factor other than sex.

2
3

Are you suggesting any different analysis
for the age category than for the sex category.

4

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, certainly what you have

5

to show before you get to the defense is different in

6

the two statutes.

7

neither requires proof of intentional discrimination.

8

For example, in Corning Glass Works all the plaintiffs

9

showed there was that a facially neutral practice, that

10

is paying the night shift folks more than the day shift

11

folks, resulted in women getting paid less than men for

12

the same work, and that was sufficient to shift the

13

burden over to the employer to show that it was based on

14

any other factor other than age.

15

They are similar in the sense that

And in here we think that it's similar, that

16

the plaintiff has to show that a neutral employment

17

practice has a disparate impact on the basis of age.

18

think in our view, in addition, the plaintiff has to

make the full Wards Cove showing that would be

sufficient in Title VII to establish liability

conclusively.

MR. RUSSELL:

The burden of persuasion as

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why is it that if the

employer has the burden of production, and I assume that

7

is satisfied by his saying, here's the plan that we

8

used, here are the factors we used, here is the reason

9

we used them.

What is so difficult for the -- what is

10

the difficulty in saying that the employee then has to

11

show that that is unreasonable?

12

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, we think there are some

13

difficulties, but it's ultimately I think beside the

14

point.

15

but what does the statute -- what rule does the statute

16

contemplate?

17

provision as a traditional affirmative defense --

The question is not what rule would make sense,

And we think by phrasing the RFOA

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You think the statute

MR. RUSSELL:

I think the statute makes

disagree --

why is it beyond the employee's means and capacity to

show that this is unreasonable?

13

that's the gravamen of this case.

that the factors that weigh in on the reasonableness

better access to it; it makes sense for them to bear the

22

burden.

23

I don't think it's an impossible

Certainly Congress could have written the

We do think that it makes sense because --

But ultimately our argument isn't grounded

24

on the claim that it would be impossible for Congress to

have imposed that burden.

It's grounded on the claim
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that the text of the statute indicates that Congress

2

made a different decision, that is it accommodated the

3

employers' interests in dealing with the special facts

4

of age discrimination differently.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, if I find the text

6

of the statute neutral or at least not clear, then it is

7

proper for me to ask as a matter of efficiency where the

8

burden should be placed, is it not?

9

MR. RUSSELL:

It is.

It is.

And my answer

10

is that we do think that most of the facts going to

11

reasonableness are in the employer's possession.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but the facts

13

-- I mean, given discovery, that doesn't seem a very

14

compelling case.

15

up -- in other words, the burden of production -- and

16

say, well, the reason we did it was this, then it's just

17

a matter of discovery.

18

then let me depose that person who is the head of, you

19

know, whatever the department.

20

reasons, for some reason, or training issues, well, then

21

we depose the person who is in charge of training or

22

safety and ask them those questions.

23

seem to me that the fact that the employer possesses the

24

information, given very liberal discovery we have, is

25

much of a factor.

Once you require the employer to come

Discovery can always mitigate that

6

But we ultimately think, you know, if you

7

find the statute so ambiguous as to think that it's a

8

really critical consideration of what makes the most

sense, then you ought to defer to the judgment of the

10

EEOC on this question.

11
12
13

I would like to address if I could one
specific -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the argument was that

14

EEOC never spoke to disparate impact?

15

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, it's certainly clear

16

that the EEOC -- what their position is, and that they

17

read their regulation as addressing disparate impact;

18

and we think that, although it's an inartfully drafted

19

regulation, by using the terms "individual claim of

20

discriminatory treatment" rather than the term of art

21

"disparate treatment," the language is broad enough to

22

bear their reading, particularly when you see that it

23

was enacted in the aftermath of a Department of Labor

24

regulation that nobody disputes addresses

25

disparate-impact cases, and it has no indication that
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

they were disavowing that position.

2
3

But if I could address the one other
objective --

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

In this area of the law,

5

"treatment" and "impact" are words that have

6

tremendously different meaning.

7

argue that they used the term "treatment" when they

8

really meant "impact"?

9

MR. RUSSELL:

Isn't it strange to

Well, I -- I think that the

10

terms of art are "adverse impact" and "disparate

11

treatment."

12

of those, I think, supports the idea that they weren't

13

talking about either one specifically.

14

it's a hard to read regulation.

15

And so that their failure to use either one

I agree, it's --

But if I could turn, for a moment, to the

16

Adams Fruit objection, which is Respondent's insistence

17

that this is not the kind of question that the Court

18

should defer to an agency on.

19

this is a substantive question of law.

20

of whether reasonableness is an element of the unlawful

21

employment practice in section 4(a)(2), the same kind of

22

question this Court asked in Smith when it decided

23

whether discriminatory intent was an element of the

24

4(a)(2) cause of action.

25

My point is simply that
It's a question

And the -- Congress has delegated authority
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to the EEOC to address those kinds of questions.

2

fact, it went so far as to delegate to the authority --

delegate to the EEOC the authority not only to construe

4

the exceptions that are in the Act, but to create

5

additional exceptions.

very surprised, indeed, to find out that this is not the

sort of question to which it had delegated authority to

18

In

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. JOSEFFER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Congress enacted the ADEA against a settled

19

background rule that defendants bear the burden of

20

persuasion on affirmative defenses and other exceptions

21

to liability.

22

statute that the "reasonable factors other than age"

23

provision is precisely such an affirmative defense.

24

did so first by saying that the provision applies to

25

activities that are "otherwise prohibited by subsection

And Congress made very clear in the

17
Alderson Reporting Company

It

1

A."

2

That has to mean that liability for

3

disparate impacts exists under subsection A without

4

regard to whether the employment practice is based on

5

reasonable factors other than age.

6

is then a defense to the liability that would "otherwise

7

exist" under subsection A.

8
9

The latter inquiry

The second is a point that Justice Ginsburg
made, which is that this subsection (f)(1) lists three

10

different defenses right in a row.

It appears to be

11

common ground that the other two are clearly affirmative

12

defenses as to which the employer bears the burden of

13

persuasion.

14

introduced by the same "otherwise prohibited" language

15

and they are set forth in a single sentence separated

16

only by commas, there is no basis for distinguishing

17

among them.

And considering that all three are

18

Now, the defendant's main argument seems --

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm not sure that if the

20

statute contains three different conditions, three

21

different commands, that it follows that the procedural

22

implementations for all of these has to be the same.

23
24
25

Do you have any authority for that
proposition?
MR. JOSEFFER:

No.

I mean, it's just a

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

matter of how to interpret the particular statute.

2

since our point here is that this is a subsection on its

3

face --

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And

If you want to say that

5

Congress was well aware of burden of persuasion, burden

6

of production problems with affirmative action, then

7

they wouldn't have drafted it this way, that's one

8

thing.

9
10

I'm not sure that that's true.

It's also the only way to make sense of the
statute as a whole, because the defendant's view seems

to be that "because of age" under subsection (a)(2) and

"reasonable factors other than age" under subsection

And that's

2

confirmed by the fact that the first sentence that talks

about the employment practices is written in the plural,

4

whereas "adverse effect" and "because of" are written in

the singular with respect to individual, which is

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The problem is that you

4

would be making this provision more generous to the

5

plaintiff than -- for example, in Title VII the defense

6

is business necessity; the employer has the burden of

7

production; the employee has the burden of persuasion.

8

Here you'd read -- you're saying you come into the

9

covered category, you were shown because of age through

10

impact, and then the burden -- the total burden is on

11

the employer.

Am -- am I making myself clear here?

MR. JOSEFFER:

I think -- I think I

16

it relies on the reasonable factors -- the

reasonableness defense, which is a much lower standard

explanations for age disparity.

Since then, however, in every one of these

burden on the defendant.

according to this Court's decision in Corning Glass.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, I was

MR. JOSEFFER:

Auer -- in our view the

regulation itself as far as it goes is entitled to

Chevron deference, because it's a notice and comment

rulemaking pursuant to delegated legislative authority.

21

We recognize, however, that the regulation on its face

22

is at best inartfully written; and therefore, the

23

question is how to interpret the regulation.

24
25

We think EEOC's interpretation of its
regulation in context is reasonable for a combination of
23

1

a few factors.

2

contemporaneously enacted a regulation putting the

3

burden on the employer in all cases.

4

First, the Department of Labor

Second, when the EEOC took over rulemaking

5

authority, it didn't insert this unusual discriminatory

6

treatment language in there, but the EEOC's position at

7

that time and ever since has been that it did not intend

8

a substantive change.

9

And third, discriminatory treatment, while

10

it undoubtedly throws a real wrench in -- or wrinkle

11

into things -- excuse me -- and takes us out of Chevron

12

and into Auer, is not a term of art.

13

treatment is a term of art.

thought Auer deference tells you how to interpret the

regulation.

20

you need to know what to do with it.

21

MR. JOSEFFER:

And having once interpreted the regulation,

My understanding of Auer

22

deference is that the agency gets deference as the

reasonable interpretation of its regulation.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

6

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

7
8

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

9

I want to make an argument both from

10

elegance and from function and from structure.

11

the employment discrimination -- a wide range of

12

employment discrimination, beginning with this Court's

13

decision in McDonnell Douglas, this Court has applied a

14

three-step balance-shifting paradigm in order to help

15

juries resolve the question of whether discrimination

16

occurred.

17

burden -- the first step, the plaintiff has to establish

18

a prima facie case that he was the subject of disparate

19

treatment because of his race or sex.

20

Under

In the disparate treatment cases there is a

The burden of production then shifts to the

21

defendant in order to explain, under disparate treatment

22

cases, a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason, which

23

eliminates the presumption consistent with Evidence Rule

24

301, and the burden of proof then resumes on the

25

plaintiff to prove discrimination because of the
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

prohibited characteristic.

2

Now, in Wards Cove, this Court looked both

3

to Rule 301 and to the paradigm in other discrimination

4

cases to apply a three-part test, in which there is a

5

burden of proof to establish a presumption, a burden of

6

production to neutralize it, and then a burden of proof

7

to show because of race.

8

The Second Circuit has done exactly that in

9

this case, and we think they are right not just because

10

that harmonizes this Court's prior discrimination cases,

11

and not just because three seems to be more elegant than

12

the four steps that the Petitioners want or the two

13

steps that the Government wants, but because it makes

14

sense.

15

And this goes directly to the question, I

16

think it was, that Justice Alito asked:

17

the "reasonable factors other than age" inquiry is

18

simply what's necessary to show liability, that is, that

19

it was because of.

20

Whether or not

The ADEA doesn't prohibit disparate

21

treatment.

It doesn't prohibit disparate impact.

22

prohibits -- doesn't prohibit employment practices

23

simply because they correlate negatively with age.

24

plaintiff has to prove that he has suffered adverse

25

employment action because of his age.
28
Alderson Reporting Company

It

A

And the question

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

whether an employer based its action on reasonable

2

factors other than age is part and parcel of that

3

inquiry.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8
9

Mr. Waxman, the first

part --

6
7

It's not a free-standing --

MR. WAXMAN:

-- confession and avoidance

defense.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The way you phrased the

first part, it sounded to me like you were going back to

10

the interpretation that this Court rejected, that is,

11

under the Age Discrimination Act there is only

12

differential treatment, not neutral factor with a

13

differential impact.

14

MR. WAXMAN:

No, not at all.

Not at all.

15

If I said that, I certainly don't want to be mistaken.

16

We are not up here arguing that there is no disparate

17

impact theory of liability under the ADEA as there is

18

under Title VII.

19

Smith, and it resolved it in large part by reference to

20

the "reasonable factors other than age" provision, which

21

Justice Stevens' opinion for a plurality of the Court

22

explained that, when you have a disparate treatment

23

case, if the plaintiff proves that his -- his or her

24

treatment -- if the defendant proves that it was because

25

of something other than age, it isn't disparate

This Court resolved that question in

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

treatment.

2

The fact that there is an RFOA provision, we

3

think, does reflect the fact that there is the potential

4

for liability under disparate impact, but as this Court

5

explained, it's narrower.

6

not only because the 1991 amendments didn't apply to age

7

cases; it's narrower, because as this Court has

8

recognized in almost every age case it has decided, age

9

-- unlike race and sex and religion and national origin

And it's narrower because --

10

-- often does -- sad to say by somebody who is in his

11

second decade of protection under the ADEA -- often does

12

correlate with reasonable employment factors.

13

And the fact that all -- what it means is

14

that at step one of the burden-shifting analysis, the

15

Wards Cove analysis, which in a race or sex case

16

establishes a strong presumption that the employment

17

action was because of race or sex because there are so

18

few employment characteristics that do correlate

19

negatively with one's race or one's gender, it's a

20

strong presumption which nonetheless need be met only by

21

a burden of production.

22

This Court has recognized that in the age

23

context, the presumption actually is quite weak.

24

would be more than perverse to adopt the Government's

25

proposal, which is that notwithstanding the much weaker
30
Alderson Reporting Company

And it

inference, the burden of persuasion is now on the

11

Mr. Waxman, what do you do

about the language "otherwise prohibited"?

7

9

And, in fact, the principal

Sure.

-- Justice Stevens, and go

right to "otherwise prohibited"?

15

The government's proposal under which, once

16

the employer establishes the statistical disparity, the

17

burden of proof shifts to the employer, equates what

18

this Court has said over and over again is a prima facie

19

case or a presumption into liability.

20

precisely the opposite result that this Court found in

21

St. Mary's Honor Center.

22

silence by the defendant, not to say, well, you may

23

consider this presumption to be enough if you don't hear

24

any other evidence.

25

statistical disparity is proof of discrimination.

It would dictate

It would allow the jury, upon

It would tell the jury the proof of

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

that's just wrong.

2

Now, "otherwise prohibited" --

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Even that, there's a

4

question about not merely statistical disparity, but a

5

causal connection between an identified practice --

6

MR. WAXMAN:

Right.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

8

MR. WAXMAN:

9

Now, with respect to the structure of the

-- in the disparity.

That's exactly right.

10

statute and "otherwise prohibited," the -- my friends on

11

the other side of this case turn almost everything on

12

the fact that the "reasonable factors other than age"

13

provision applies in -- in subsection (f) and is -- as

14

Justice Ginsburg said -- is sandwiched in between two

15

other provisions that, for argument's sake, let's just

16

acknowledge are affirmative defenses on which the

17

employer would bear the burden of proof.

18

doesn't that prove anything?

19

And why

I'll go first to "otherwise prohibited" and

20

then explain why the sandwich effect is no more

21

persuasive here than it was to the Court in Betts.

22

"Otherwise prohibited" means that it is

23

prohibited subject to the following conditions.

24

doesn't say who bears the burden of those conditions.

25

It

What it reflects, Justice Stevens, is this
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

fact.

You could have taken everything that is in F and

2

just put it into A, but you would then have had to put

3

it into B and C and E.

4

it didn't say not -- things that are prohibited in

5

Section A won't be unlawful if X, Y and Z.

6

"otherwise prohibited" in those sections.

7

And so what Congress said was --

It says

In other words, it doesn't -- it means

8

nothing other than it's prohibited subject to the

9

following conditions.

Now, I will acknowledge for

10

argument's purposes -- and it actually suits my argument

11

-- to show that the BFOQ defense and the

12

foreign-employer defense are affirmative defenses.

13

Because as we -- as we know from Black's Law Dictionary

14

and this Court's decisions, Dixon, for example, an

15

affirmative defense is a defense that says:

16

allegations of the complaint, but I have a justification

17

for it that the law recognizes.

18

Now, that's --

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I admit the

Isn't it -- isn't the --

20

isn't the weak point in your argument the following:

21

Your argument assumes that when the employer implicitly

22

says I admit the allegations the complainant made, that

23

the employer is admitting, in effect, to disparate

24

treatment.

25

my purpose to discriminate against the old.

That he is saying:

I did it because it was

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

But if we read the "because" language as

2

also admitting the meaning, "I did it or it had an

3

impact by reason of the age, regardless of my intent,"

4

then this incongruity that you are arguing about

5

disappears.

6

MR. WAXMAN:

No.

It is quite to the

7

contrary, unless -- and it may be the case that I'm

8

completely misunderstanding you.

9

The point is that at step one the plaintiff

10

has to prove a statistical disparity, a substantial,

11

negative, statistical correlation.

12

presumption that what was otherwise a neutral -- appears

13

to be a neutral factor was, in fact, because of age.

14

There are plenty of instances in which there is

MR. WAXMAN:

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

24
25

No, no; not at all.
Well, then I'm not

following you.
MR. WAXMAN:

Let's take their -- let's take

their 50-pound hypothetical.

The employer says:

37
Alderson Reporting Company

Okay,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

from now on all of our employees have to be able to lift

2

50 pounds over their head, you know, 10 times in 30

3

seconds.

4

people, you know, say:

5

wiped us out.

6

substantial adverse effect on us because we are old, and

7

we have less upper body strength.

8
9

And older people or women -- let's say older
Well, statistically, that has

That has had a substantial -- a

The employer then gives -- comes forward
with a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason or a

10

reasonable factor other than age, and says, for example,

11

well, you know, this is -- we need our employees to be

12

able to lift strong things.

13

and says, I am an accountant, that's not reasonable,

14

it's a very different case than if this is a requirement

15

imposed on stocking clerks in an auto parts -- auto

16

parts shop where you do have to lift very heavy things

17

over your head.

18

If the plaintiff comes back

In other words, the paradigm that this Court

19

set out in Wards Cove applies exactly the same way.

20

applies a three-part test except that at step three the

21

standard of justification is different.

22

And this, I think -- I hope, Justice

It

23

Stephens, goes to your question.

In Wards Cove this

24

Court said you show a prima facie case of a disparate

25

impact.

The burden then -- the burden of production
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

then shifts to the employer to explain that it was --

2

there is a business -- to articulate a business

3

justification for the facially neutral requirement.

4

And what the plaintiff then has to do is

5

bear the burden of proving that that wasn't a business

6

necessity; that there is one other way, one other way in

7

which it could have been done; and, therefore --

8
9
10
11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you there agree that

there is a distinction between "business necessity" and
"business reasonableness"?
MR. WAXMAN:

Yes.

And, in fact, I think

12

it's sort of embedded in the very opening of the blue

13

brief in this case, where the Petitioner says:

14

the Court has sometimes used the word "business

15

justification," and the Court has sometimes used the

16

word "business necessity," and we don't really think

17

that means anything, so we use the words

18

interchangeably.

19

Well,

But this case shows that it means everything

20

because at step three of Wards Cove the petitioner --

21

the plaintiff's burden is proving that it is -- that

22

there is one other way -- that all you have to show is

23

that it wasn't a necessity to do it that way in order to

24

achieve your objective and the employee wins.

25

But because of the differential in
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

correlation between age and employment factors, in this

2

case it is a business justification; that is, the

3

employee has to come in and say it just wasn't

4

reasonable to use that.

5

And this case is a perfect example.

Here we

have a research lab that has one client.

It's the

We aren't going to have as much work for you.

15

that those judgments corresponded with overall

management's responsibilities.

But after the managers engage in this

Still, the numbers, the

way it came out, are rather startling.

be over 40.
41
Alderson Reporting Company

That there were

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. WAXMAN:

That's correct.

And as the

2

district court found and the court of appeals found,

3

those were strikingly stark numbers.

4

that they came to the immediate attention of the

5

company's management and general counsel, Mr. Correa,

6

who was -- who looked at this and said:

7

get sued for age discrimination.

8

about this?

9

They were so stark

We are going to

What should we do

And what he did about this, what the proof

showed, is he went back and said:

13

We'll go back and redo it so that the age distribution

14

comes out right.

astounding -- defines "older worker" as somebody over

We did this right; we used a matrix that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the terms

22

"flexibility," "criticality" -- I mean the way you

23

described it, it sounds very mechanical, mathematical.

24

But those terms are -- they call for some human

25

judgment.
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. WAXMAN:

They definitely do.

And the

2

second question that was presented in this case, which

3

the Court didn't accept, was an assertion by the

4

Petitioner that the Second Circuit had assertedly held

5

that where a reasonable factor other than age derives

6

from a subjective judgment, the Second Circuit had held

7

that it was immune from review under disparate-impact

8

theory, which, as the Government pointed out in its

9

invitation brief, is not at all what the Second Circuit

10
11

held.
The point is that this Court in Smith and

12

earlier in Hazen Paper and earlier age cases was highly

13

cognizant of the fact that unless there is a test that

14

implies that -- that applies certainty for employers,

15

there is going to be -- age -- if this standard isn't

16

reasonable and if it isn't up to the other side to prove

17

that it's unreasonable, employers are essentially going

18

to take age into account.

19

Mr. Correa testified he wouldn't do, which is rejigger

20

the results to come up with a -- a percentage that more

21

approximated the balance in the work force.

22

this Court has said repeatedly --

23

They are going to do what

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that,

Well, maybe because he

24

thought that, given the subjectivity of some of these

25

factors, that there was at least unconscious age bias in
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the decisions that were made.

2

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, that is

3

why -- and it was testimony both from the employees in

4

the case and from our uncross-examined expert and even

5

their expert -- the review board -- the company set up a

6

central review board which was trained and which

7

examined every single manager about every single

8

decision, whether you call it subjective or objective.

9

Now, the district court -- the trial court

10

who heard the testimony said that he -- he deemed

11

flexibility and criticality objective.

12

were objective factors because of all the instructions

13

that were given, which we have reprinted in the joint

14

appendix in this case.

15

certainly take your point, Justice Ginsburg, that if you

16

ask a manager to evaluate an employee on the degree of

17

criticality of that employee's skills or the flexibility

18

of that employee, you can give her all the training in

19

the world.

20

Ultimately, you're relying on a judgment by a human

21

being of another human being.

22

He said they

But even assuming -- and I

You can give her a 16-point checklist.

But why would we not want employers to do

23

that?

Why would we want them to -- to retreat to the

24

safe harbor of some safe quota.

25

a 60/40 split in our work force; and, wow, these

You know, gee, we have

44
Alderson Reporting Company

numbers, we did it according to Hoyle.

2

this is the paradigm RIF process, but go back and do it

3

in a way that comes out with a specific set of numbers.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We've done --

Counsel, is your

5

recent discussion about what happened here go simply to,

6

I guess, your alternative argument, that we should

7

affirm because you're right, regardless of who bears the

8

burden; or does it really go to the legal question

9

before us?

10

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, I think it goes to both.

11

I mean it goes to -- it simply -- it certainly goes to

12

the question over whether, whoever has the burden on

13

reasonableness, you ought to do what you did in Smith

14

and what the Eleventh Circuit did in Montalvo, which is

15

the case you cited in Smith.

2

There is -- under step three of Wards Cove, which is how

3

this case was tried, it was concededly the plaintiff's

4

burden to prove that there was some other way, one other

5

way, to do what the company wanted that established that

6

this wasn't a business necessity.

7

to the Court that in five and a half weeks of testimony

8

there is not one sentence of evidence to that effect.

9

This is even assuming Wards Cove were the test.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And I will represent

But that was taken out of

it by Judge Jacobs when he redid it.

on the wrong track with business necessity.

13

He said, we were
Business

It's only reasonable factor of age.

MR. WAXMAN:

What Judge Jacobs said is the

14

case was tried under business necessity, under which the

15

plaintiffs at least had to prove that there was some

16

other way that the company could equally have achieved

17

its objectives.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, wasn't the issue of

19

reasonable factor under age tried in the trial court

20

when the case was tried?

21

MR. WAXMAN:

No, because the EEOC regulation

22

at the time, regulation (d), which deals with

23

disparate-impact cases, said that reasonable -- the

24

reasonable factors other than age provision is proven

25

by, and only by, the business-necessity defense, a
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

defense as to which the plaintiffs bear the burden.

2

And, in fact, in Wards Cove, the Government

3

in Wards Cove was on the employer's side.

4

Government urged the court to do exactly what it did.

5

And under the Government's own regulation 1625.7(d), the

6

burden of proving reasonable factors other than age was

7

correctly on the plaintiff, but incorrectly equated with

8

the substantive showing of business.

MR. WAXMAN:

that reasonable factors other than age was a separate

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

MR. WAXMAN:

That's correct.

They

I mean that --

11

and that's because -- you could say that it was a mutual

12

mistake by everyone involved.

13

under subsection (d) of its regulations that reasonable

14

factor other than age could be established only by

15

proving business necessity.

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But the EEOC had directed

MR. WAXMAN:

That's correct.

And the -- my

point is we are --

we are entitled to judgment in our

20

favor.

21

one, the Second Circuit was correct that the burden of

22

proving reasonableness was on them, and the -- the

23

Petitioners have acknowledged expressly on page 53 of

24

their blue brief that if in fact it is true that the

25

We are entitled to an affirmance because, number

the judgment is affirmed, that is, they say when a --

if the Second Circuit is correct as to where the burden

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

3

MR. RUSSELL:

I'd like to begin by

4

addressing the general legal question that the Court

5

granted cert on, and particularly going back to this

6

idea, this assertion that the proof of the RFOA is

7

somehow a negation of the obligation that the plaintiff

8

has to prove that they have suffered a disparate impact

9

because of age.

It is simply incorrect.

It's based --

10

as, Justice Souter, I think you were suggesting in some

11

of your questions -- on a confusion about what the

12

"because of age" requirement is in a disparate-impact

13

case under Section 4(a)(2).

14

Section 4(a)(2) is simply to show that the effect of the

15

practice is felt because of age, while the defense in

16

the RFOA provision is to show that the practice itself

17

is reasonable even though it has this effect.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

The requirement under

Well, the practice -- if a

19

practice correlates with a number of -- statistically

20

correlates with a number of different factors, is it

21

because of all of those factors?

22

MR. RUSSELL:

I think, under Wards Cove,

23

this Court has said that it does, and so under Wards

24

Cove you establish that the discrimination is felt by

25

older workers because of age by showing that all the
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

workers as a group suffer disproportionately from it.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Wards Cove, in other words,

3

says "because" may mean "correlation" and it mean

4

"purpose," either one.

5

MR. RUSSELL:

Yes.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

7

MR. RUSSELL:

I mean --

Yes.

But I think all you have to

8

show under 4(a)(2) is that the practice tends to

9

disadvantage older workers because of their age.

And so

10

again in our weight -- weight example, the employer

11

admits in our weight example that the effect of the

12

neutral practice is to fall more heavily, is to restrict

13

the employment opportunities of older workers because of

14

age, but says, even if that's true -- even if there is a

15

disparate impact because of age-- we are still entitled

16

to the defense because the practice itself is

17

reasonable.

18

It's also -- I would like to address the

19

suggestion that Griggs is directed -- or disparate

20

impact is directed at ferreting out intentional

21

discrimination.

22

many cases, but that's not the sole purpose of it.

23

it's simply not the purpose of the prima facie case in

24

Wards Cove to give rise to an inference of intentional

25

discrimination, and the fact that it doesn't as strongly

Certainly it serves that function in

51
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in the age case I think isn't a reason to think that

2

Congress intended the courts to develop a different test

3

for showing what's otherwise prohibited under 4(a)(2).

4

And, finally, if I could address some of the

5

questions regarding what happened in this case.

6

case, Justice Stevens, was not tried with reasonableness

7

in mind, both because Respondents abandoned their

8

"reasonable factor other than age" defense, which they

9

had raised as an affirmative defense in their answer.

10

believe Mr. Waxman is incorrect when he suggests that

11

they in fact asked for instructions.

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

This

Well, if he put in all the

13

evidence he's described, that would not have proven

14

go to the issue of reasonableness.

It seems to me that evidence had to

It may have been relevant to

17

reasonableness, but that's not why it was put in.

Before the trial began --

19
20
21

I

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Was he arguing that it was

necessary to follow this one downsizing practice?
MR. RUSSELL:

They certainly, I think --

22

they used that argument to show that they had a business

23

justification and to try to rebut our showing of

24

alternative, equally effective practices.

25

clear by the time of trial that -- you know, they had
52
Alderson Reporting Company

But it was

proposed jury instructions that didn't ask for

reasonableness to be part of the case.

with the case on the assumption that we would be

that we showed that the current practice, reasonable or

not, had a disparate impact and was subject to an

The only instruction was that

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You have an unusual case

17

where the decisive issue, at least when you get to this

18

Court, is something the jury never passed on.

19

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, I think that's right.

20

And ordinarily I think you would say that the

21

defendants, by not raising the issue to the jury, if

22

it's an affirmative defense, have waived it.

for an excuse, given the change in law.

it.
