ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. McCULLOUGH

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

We'll hear argument

MR. McCULLOUGH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

10

This Court has again and again held that an

11

arrest is constitutionally reasonable if the officers

12

have probable cause to believe a suspect has committed a

13

crime.

14

represents the best compromise between the needs of the

15

citizens and the duty of the government to combat crime.

16

While the States are free to build additional procedures

17

on this constitutional bedrock, when they do so these

18

additional procedures are matters of State law.

19

not change the constitutional standard.

20

The Court has found that this standard

They do

The Court below erred in substituting this

21

clear, established, uniform, time-tested standard for a

22

standard that has none of those virtues.

23

First, it is undeniable that if State law

24

can raise the constitutional bar, that it will lead to

25

widespread differences on the exact same facts, on the
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

exact same crime, not only across State lines, but also

2

within a particular jurisdiction.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. McCullough -

If this officer had

5

complied with the State law, that is he had issued a

6

summons, then you agree that the exclusionary rule would

7

apply if he went ahead and searched.

8
9
10
11

MR. McCULLOUGH:

That's correct.

If he had

issued a summons, Knowles would apply and the evidence
would be excluded.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So would you explain the

12

logic to saying that when the police violate State law,

13

then the evidence can come in; but when they comply with

14

State law, it can't.

15

MR. McCULLOUGH:

Your Honor, the rationale

16

of Knowles was that the officer did not engage in any

17

extended contact with the suspect and that there was no

18

need to gather evidence.

19

But where from a constitutional sense there

20

is a full-fledged arrest, then the particular rationale

21

of Knowles doesn't apply; and I don't think the -- we're

22

asking the Court to embrace violations of State law;

23

we're asking the Court to recognize that when a State

24

goes above and beyond what the Constitution requires,

25

that the remedies for those violations should be left to
4
Alderson Reporting Company

the States.

2

And Virginia has provided a number of those

3

remedies; but here the officer did make a full custodial

MR. McCULLOUGH:

The arrest did not cease at

the Court recognized that at times the search will not

proceed immediately upon arrest.

MR. McCULLOUGH:

I think if he's doing it on

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Wow.

6

MR. McCULLOUGH:

But in terms of the

7

Federal-State distinction, Your Honor, I think what

8

we're advocating for is the uniform standard that this

9

Court has embraced before, that there should not be a

10

difference between a Federal officer on a State facility

11

who is authorized under the Assimilated Crimes Act to

12

arrest for Virginia laws and a Virginia officer who is a

13

hundred feet away with making an unconstitutional arrest

14

under the holding below when -

15

Would you agree that

there was no probable cause to arrest, given the State

if I can get a warrant.

12

Could he have gotten a warrant?

MR. McCULLOUGH:

this case he could have, but it would have caused a

14

prolonged detention of the suspect.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How could he -- how could

he have gotten a warrant to arrest when it's

a nonarrestable offense?

MR. McCULLOUGH:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

judge have told this police officer -- they have a

MR. McCULLOUGH:

The officers did not -

their only testimony was it was their prerogative.

unfortunately they did not then unpack that explanation

to say why they thought one of the exceptions applied.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Maybe we could say that in

21

this, in these unique circumstances, where the officers

22

could not let the fellow drive off without a license, it

was not unreasonable to arrest him, but in some other

situation where they had no arrest authority it would

MR. McCULLOUGH:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But suppose it works

6

the other way.

If Virginia has a law saying you can

7

arrest anybody you want on our highways, but, you know,

8

here's what the offenses are, the officers did not have

9

probable cause to think a crime had been committed, but

10

it was they had probable cause to arrest, I suppose

It -- I mean, it certainly

So I think, given the

which the person is being arrested have any relevance to

the question whether the search is reasonable?

could you go ahead and search him incident to that

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The answer is yes, they

could search?
MR. McCULLOUGH:

I'm sorry.

Yes, the answer

is yes, that if a crime has been committed the

6

bright-line rule permits the officer to search the

7

suspect for officer safety as well as -

8

JUSTICE STEVENS:

9
10

Even though the rationale

for the search incident to arrest doesn't apply?
MR. McCULLOUGH:

What the -- yes, because

11

what the Court said in Robinson was:

12

interested in delving into case-by-case litigation as to

13

how dangerous this person was and how -- and whether

14

there was a likelihood of evidence being found -

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

We're not

Why would the rationale not

16

apply in that situation?

Are you accepting the

17

proposition that anybody who's arrested for a tax

18

offense is not a danger to the arresting officer?

19

Haven't there been some pretty dangerous people arrested

20

over the years for tax offenses?

21

(Laughter.)

22

MR. McCULLOUGH:

I agree with that.

I'm

23

arguing that it's a bright-line rule and that if someone

is arrested for a crime, tax or otherwise, it's not the

25

nature of the crime 15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but you're also

2

arguing, as I understand it, that the -- that the

3

search, even in the case of the tax arrest, does fall

4

within the rationale of search incident to an arrest

Isn't that your point?

MR. McCULLOUGH:

Yes.

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

premise of the question then?

So you reject the

The premise of the

10

question was that the search incident to the arrest in

11

the tax case is outside the rationale of searches

12

incident to an arrest; and your position is it's not

13

outside it.

14

MR. McCULLOUGH:

That's correct.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

16

MR. McCULLOUGH:

This Court has crafted a

17

bright-line rule -- it has not distinguished between

18

types of offenses; it doesn't have to be a violent

19

offense; it could be a white-collar offense -- that

20

across the board there is virtue to having this

21

bright-line rule that permits the officer to search

22

incident to a lawful arrest.

23

noted that a lawful arrest is a -- that it met a

constitutionally lawful arrest, one made with probable

25

cause.

MR. DREEBEN:

authority that exceed the requirements of the Fourth

Amendment as this Court has articulated them.

16

MR. DREEBEN:

The question would then be

whether that means that it's automatically a

even a governmental official can act in a private

capacity by acting outside the boundaries of that

individual's responsibility.

And if you assume that the

Court would have two options.

It could either

20

federalize some sort of an amorphous requirement that

21

there must be law enforcement authority in an official

22

in order for that official to engage in Fourth Amendment

23

activity, or it could hold that, what I think is the

24

more reasonable approach, which is that the bedrock

25

requirements of the Fourth Amendment protect against
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

arbitrariness, and the crucial one here is the existence

2

of probable cause based on the facts to believe that the

individual has violated a law.

If that criteria is met, it is not

constitutionally unreasonable, absent where an

those are the sanctions that the State has chosen to do.

announced in Atwater and place additional restrictions

2

on the arrest authority, it must pay a constitutional

3

price of having the evidence excluded if that rule is

4

violated.

5

At the outset, it's clear that imposing such

6

a Fourth Amendment rule would do nothing other than

7

discourage the States from providing additional

8

restrictions as a matter of their own State's law that

9

may serve to protect citizen privacy interests above the

10

floor that this Court has identified as required by the

11

Fourth Amendment.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If you're right,

13

Mr. Dreeben, then the Court gave a false signal when it

14

GVR'd in Lovelace, in the Lovelace case, the person who

15

was drinking in public, it GVR'd in light of Knowles.

16

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't know that it gave a

17

false signal, Justice Ginsburg, but a GVR doesn't

18

indicate this Court's disposition of the merits once all

19

of the arguments are presented to it.

20

I think neither side is able to point to a case that

21

squarely addressed and conclusively resolved the issue

22

that's before this Court.

23

And, admittedly,

What the Court has done, I think, under

24

related issues under Fourth Amendment law is announce

25

pretty clearly that the fact that a State has either
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

renounced an interest in taking a particular law

2

enforcement action that it could otherwise

3

constitutionally take or positively prohibited a law

4

enforcement action does not mean that the action is

5

unconstitutional.

6

As long ago as the Cooper v. California

7

case, the Court dealt with the situation where an

8

officer was not authorized to undertake an inventory

9

search, and the California courts treat it as a

10
11

violation of their own law.
This Court said it was still a reasonable

12

search under the Fourth Amendment; and unless

13

Respondent -- excuse me, unless -- well, Respondent

14

concludes that there should be a different Fourth

15

Amendment rule for searches than procedures, Cooper

16

stands for the proposition that a violation of State law

17

does not ipso facto equate to a violation of the Federal

18

Constitution.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If we rule for Respondent

20

in this case, would we have to reexamine the holding in

21

California v. Greenwood?

22

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, Justice Kennedy.

23

California v. Greenwood is the next case in the line

24

where the Court recognized that California had made it

25

illegal to conduct garbage searches.
21
Alderson Reporting Company

And you could make

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the same argument that Respondent is making here today:

2

That California had renounced any interest in conducting

3

garbage searches, therefore there's nothing on the State

4

side of the line to balance against the individual's

5

invasion of privacy, and therefore the State should

6

lose.

7

California v. Greenwood, finding that it was

8

constitutionally reasonable to engage in the garbage

9

search because there was no federally recognized

And this Court held precisely the opposite in

10

expectation of privacy, even though the State had

11

decided to go further and grant an additional layer of

12

protection to its citizens.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There could not have been

14

a warrant -- a grant-- a judge could not have given a

15

warrant for arrest on these charges.

16

MR. DREEBEN:

I'm venturing a little bit

17

outside of my expertise under State law, but I think

18

that that's correct.

19

this was not an arrestable offense unless one of the

20

exceptions to the offense existed.

21

Because State law provided that

And I should note that one of the offenses

here -- excuse me -- one of the exceptions here is that

MR. DREEBEN:

The McNabb-Mallory rule -

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. DREEBEN:

Which is Federal.

-- is uniquely Federal.

The

6

closest analog -- and this may be what Your Honor has in

7

mind -- is that in the County of Riverside case the

8

Court set a 48-hour outside limit for when you have to

9

bring an arrested individual before a magistrate for a

probable cause hearing.

No, and that's precisely, I

think, the point.

All of the rules that this Court has

announced under the Fourth Amendment, the search

incident to arrest rule, which is triggered as a

18

bright-line rule without regard to whether the specifics

19

of the case support it, under Respondent's theory

Virginia could overrule that by saying officers shall

not conduct a search incident to arrest without a

22

specific exigency in that case.

Respondent's theory that you absorb State law into the

decision would be overruled.

5

Atwater would be overruled with respect to

6

non-arrestable offenses if Respondent's position is

7

correct that when the State has said that we don't want

to undertake an arrest for a minor offense, therefore,

9

there's no longer any State interest in undertaking the

11

The reality is that this Court has balanced

12

as a matter of Fourth Amendment law what is

13

constitutionally necessary as a uniform Federal matter

14

to protect people against arbitrary law enforcement

15

action, and it's drawn the line at probable cause.

16

as this Court said in Whren, absent rare circumstances

when probable cause exists, a search or seizure is

reasonable.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

5
6
7

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The notion that the proud men who framed the

8

Constitution would believe it reasonable to go out and

9

arrest someone for a non-arrestable offense and not only

10

do that, but having committed that trespass at common

11

law, to further search them, is I think an extreme

12

proposition and one that they would not have accepted.

13
14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

accept arresting somebody for not wearing a seat belt?

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17
18

But you think they would

Your Honor, I do It seems to me we've

crossed that bridge with Atwater.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

No, Your Honor, I disagree,

19

for the reason that -- and there are obviously -- I'm

20

not here to tell the Court what its own precedents mean.

21

But Atwater makes quite clear that at common law this

22

was something that was subject to legislate ive

23

override, and that's what was reasonable at common law

24

when the Constitution was framed.

25

legislatures sometimes said that you could arrest and

And that is,

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

sometimes said that you couldn't.

2

But two things were undisputable, I think,

3

and that is when you did arrest illegally that was

4

unreasonable -

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

The particular illegal

6

arrest here, to bring this down to earth a little bit,

7

is I take it they arrested him because he had a

8

suspended -- he was driving without a good license?

9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

10

Yes.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So that Virginia law

11

says if you stop somebody, arrest him -- if you stop

12

somebody, you know he doesn't have a license to drive,

13

you can arrest him if you think he's going to continue

14

driving?

Can't you?

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So the policemen

17

here, according to you and I guess the Virginia court,

18

made a misjudgment.

19

drive somewhere or he might have thought it or a

20

policeman in similar circumstances might have thought

21

it.

22

He thought this guy might still

So Virginia says if, in fact, policemen, you

23

stop somebody for suspended -- for driving without a

24

license, and you make a mistake, you arrest him, we

25

don't think that's a big deal, because who knows if he's
27
Alderson Reporting Company

1

going to continue to drive.

2

don't even suspend.

3

evidence.

4

We don't even suspend.

We

We don't even suppress the

That's Virginia.
So if Virginia isn't going to suppress the

5

evidence because they think it's not a big deal to make,

6

for the policeman to make a mistake as to whether a

7

person who's driving without a license will keep driving

8

once the policeman goes away, why do you think Thomas

9

Jefferson and everybody else thought that that was such

10

a big deal that the evidence had to be suppressed?

11

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

For a few reasons.

12

Virginia does take this quite seriously.

13

can be fired for violating the statute.

14

thing.

15

First,

The officer
That's no small

The second is I wouldn't assume that

16

Virginia believes and the Virginia legislature believed

17

that the evidence would not be suppressed, because for

18

reasons that I'll explain in a minute the Virginia

19

legislature was triggering a long line of its court

20

cases that say if you arrest someone for a

21

non-arrestable offense, the Fourth Amendment is

22

violated, and the application of the exclusionary rule

23

has never been questioned in that context.

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

questioned in your footnote 13 in your brief.
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Well, I thought it's
You seem

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to suggest that the exclusionary rule is not at issue in

this case.

3

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That's right.

I don't

4

question its application, but neither does Virginia,

5

Your Honor.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So - so we should

7

write an opinion saying we're not saying that it was

8

correct to -- we're not saying that it was correct to

9

exclude the evidence in this case?

10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That's -- I think that

11

that's right.

That also happened in California v.

12

Greenwood, you may recall, Mr. Chief Justice, where

13

there was some discussion at oral argument about would

14

we believe the exclusionary rule should be applied here.

That question had not been preserved.

20

officer cannot approach a car except in immediate cases

of immediate danger.

such a big deal and we don't think the Fourth Amendment

23

turns on that kind of triviality.

24

All right.

25

That is, in Whren the arrest

And in Whren we said that isn't

If it doesn't turn on that kind

of arrest procedure triviality, is how we characterized

it there, how is this any any different?

2

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Whren is different in

3

several different ways.

4

challenge to the stop, not the search incident to

5

arrest.

6

D.C. Government regulation did not have the power to

7

make a traffic stop because there was a local regulation

8

that said if you're not in uniform and if you're not in

9

a police car, a marked car, you shouldn't make those

10

The first is that that was a

The claim was that the officers under a local

traffic stops.

11

So, it's different on a couple of different

12

actions.

13

the nature of the law that's being evoked, the local

14

regulation rather than legislation, I think, are the

15

principal ones.

16

The nature of the constitutional challenge,

Here we're dealing with something quite

17

fundamental, and I haven't gotten to this

18

Court's precedents applying the common law rule that I

19

described at the beginning, so if I could do and then

20

compare Whren.

21

since Weeks, which is the first case of this Court to

22

recognize the search incident arrest exception, all the

23

way through Di Re, Miller, Johnson, Ker, DeFillippo,

24

those are five cases that confront the question in this

25

case, I believe that genuinely confront it; is not

Post -- define the common law, every

30
Alderson Reporting Company

dictum, it is holding.

2

Those cases confront the question:

Can you

have a constitutional search incident to an illegal

4

arrest?

5

violation of State law.

6

Illegal there not being unconstitutional, but a

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, why do you draw a

7

distinction between something that's prohibited by a

8

statute, something that's prohibited by a local ordnance

9

or let's say it's a directive of the police department?

10

And if it's -- if the arrest is contrary to any of those

11

things, it's unlawful under State law, is it not?

12

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

The court hasn't ever

13

confronted that question.

14

cases that I described were one of two things, Positive

15

State legislation enacted by the legislature or common

16

law.

17

Whren suggests that maybe a local police regulation is

18

too variable.

19

The places -- the line of

It has never dealt with the locality question.

We would win under either rule.

The -- I think the core reason you would

20

draw the line at legislation is because this -- the

21

Fourth Amendment is not just an instrumental thing

22

designed to do good.

23

common law concepts of reasonableness, which was the

24

foundation -

25

It is, as designed, to apply

JUSTICE ALITO:

I thought it was your
31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

argument that if the arrest is unlawful under State law

2

it's an unreasonable search, an unreasonable arrest

3

under the Fourth Amendment?

4

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That's right.

And your

5

question, Justice Alito, is designed to test what I mean

6

by unlawful in terms of what sources -- the State

7

constitution, legislation, local police practices.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.

It's designed to test

whether you really mean unlawful under State law.

10

Either you don't mean it, because something that

11

violates a municipal ordnance is unlawful under State

12

law, and yet you would not apply your test.

13

could express your test differently, unlawful under

14

State statutory law.

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

So you

If I have conveyed that

16

impression, I am sorry.

17

is that if it's unlawful.

18

could conclude that local police regulations, for

19

example, are too variable to -- and Whren calls them

20

"trivialities," so we won't pick them up.

21

I did not intend to.

Our rule

All I'm saying is the Court

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, it says the laws

22

of the 50 States are pretty variable on this question as

23

well.

24
25

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

As are the laws of whether

it's a crime at all, as are under Indianapolis v. Edmund
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and lots of other cases where the court -

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do we have to look

3

at both of those varieties?

Let's say the State has a

4

rule that, yes, you can arrest people in a way that we

5

would say you can't, but you don't have to have probable

6

cause.

You just have to -- they're just arrestable.

7

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

No, as Justice Ginsburg

8

suggests, you have to have probable cases to arrest.

9

Cases like Berkemer, Seth -

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- is probable cause

11

to arrest.

12

in these circumstances whether or not you have probable

13

cause to believe that a crime has been committed.

14

The State has a law that says you can arrest

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I'm sorry.

By that phrase I

15

mean there is a constitutional component.

Part of the

16

constitutional floor is that you have to have sufficient

17

cause.

18

This Court's cases make clear you can't go below -

That's a guarantee of the Fourth Amendment.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought you were

20

telling us it has to be sufficient cause to arrest, not

21

sufficient cause to believe that a crime has been

22

committed.

23

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That is necessary but not a

24

sufficient condition, Mr. Chief Justice.

25

obviously a -- the constitutional floor includes the

Alderson Reporting Company

element of the -- the degree of proof that's required by

We may be just having CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

probable cause to arrest because State law makes it

14

15

They had probable cause to believe a

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

In that sense, absolutely.

16

I just wanted to make sure I understood the terminology.

17

That's correct.

18

But let me make quite clear that we are

19

discussing in the first half hour and the second half

20

hour I think two slightly different things.

21

half hour focused on the constitutionality of the arrest

22

vel non, which is at issue in Atwater, for example, and

23

at issue -- not even in Whren, which is just a traffic

24

stop.

25

The first

I am focusing on the somewhat different
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

point.

There is a line of cases that deals with the

2

constitutionality of the search incident to arrest and

3

it says because at common law you could not search

4

someone pursuant to an arrest that was a trespass, the

5

search itself is unconstitutional.

6

the framing a Federal officer, a Federal marshal, at the

7

time of the framing had the power to arrest them for

8

State law offenses, as they still do under the OLC

9

opinions.

10

So if at the time of

If a Federal marshal had gone up to someone

11

who's committing a completely trivial offense, Atwater

12

recognizes there are offenses at common law that are not

13

arrestable.

14

person incident to that arrest would have violated the

15

Fourth Amendment, we believe.

16

unreasonable.

17

the States, it would have been -

18

That would be a trespass and to search the

It would have been

When Mapp applies the Fourth Amendment to

What if the State

19

makes a trivial offense arrestable, as in Atwater?

20

You're suggesting in that situation the common law rule

21

we have doesn't apply.

22

made arrestable and therefore it doesn't violate the

23

Fourth Amendment to search incident to that arrest.

24
25

It's a trivial offense, but it's

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That's right.

At common law

and under the Fourth Amendment, that's right.
35
Alderson Reporting Company

You look

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to the positive source of authority, which is State law

2

authority to arrest or a common law authority to arrest.

3

That would not be unconstitutional.

4

also make sense as a question of the structure of our

5

democracy.

6

legislature, which can be held responsible for the

7

decision to make a trivial offense -

8
9

That -- that rule

Remember, it puts in the hands of the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, what if

the legislature -- this was the hypothetical Mr. Dreeben

10

posed.

What if the legislature says yes, you can arrest

11

for this offense but you cannot search incident to the

12

arrest, because we think that's too much of an intrusion

13

given the fact that it's a relatively trivial offense?

14

In that case, would our doctrine saying under the Fourth

15

Amendment you can search incident to a valid arrest be

16

reversed preempted, preempted by the State law?

17

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

No.

There are times -

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the State can

19

define the circumstances under which you can have an

20

arrest, but the State can't define and limit the

21

consequences of the arrest?

22

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That's right.

That is -

23

there are traditions that are rooted in the common law,

24

that the search incident to arrest here was pursuant to

25

a trespass at common law that was completely
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

unreasonable.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

But isn't -- isn't the

3

difficulty with that argument that we -- we have

4

rejected the, in effect, the trespass rationale; and

5

what you're telling us now, it seems to me, based on in

6

effect trespass concepts, is that so far as the Fourth

7

Amendment is concerned an arrest may constitutionally be

8

made, but the officer following that arrest may not take

9

the step of determining whether the individual arrested

10

has on his person anything that can be used to hurt the

11

officer like a knife or a gun?

12

And why should be we draw what seems to

13

me -- if we scrap, as we have done, the trespass

14

analogy, why should we make what seems to me at least an

15

irrational distinction of saying the Fourth Amendment

16

says it's okay to arrest but it's not okay to protect

17

yourself after you have arrested?

18

such a rule?

19

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Why should we accept

This is I think the hardest

20

question for us, and so if I could have the time to give

21

you a couple of answers.

22

instrumental point is that the officer has the person,

23

they need to protect themselves.

24

itself -- and I'm going to give you a couple of

25

This individual had every reason to believe

arrest.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If that -- if that logic is

sound and that logic depends on Justice Powell's use of

the word unlawfully, then it seems to me the -- the only

way to arrest an irrational system would to be conclude

16

that, in fact, the arrest is not constitutionally

lawful.

18

with the problem that I raised; and a constitutional

arrest in which the officer does not violate the Fourth

Amendment by apprehending the person, and yet the

21

officer is disabled from protecting himself, if we're

22

going to have a sensible rule, we've either got to say

are times when it isn't.

is that the premise of when you were deciding in a -- in

Because, the reason I asked my question is I

want to have an answer, and I want your best thinking on

14

this.

15

whether it violates the Fourth Amendment when a State -

16

when a person is arrested in violation of State law, the

17

answer is:

18

Obviously, if there is no probable cause or if there

19

wasn't a crime at all, as just defined, the answer is

20

yes; but then I look at Whren and it says if all that

21

was at stake was a kind of arrest procedure State law,

22

herein -- there embodied in a rule, the answer is no.

23

So I look at this one.

24

there is probable cause; it is a crime; moreover, it is

25

a crime for which the State permits arrest where the

My thought is that the answer to the question of

it depends.

Sometimes yes, sometimes no.

And this one it seems to me

So it seems to me that's maybe much more close to what

Now I want you to say -- I want your

comments on what I -- it's hypothetical, my statement,

because I want to get your reaction to that point of

view.

I'm not saying I hold it.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

But I'm putting it

terribly difficult rule to administer when you try to

he has to have a badge or not.

it seems to you we rely on the citizen's expectation of

20

Justice Kennedy makes a rather strong response to that,

21

because it's unrealistic to assume that a citizen in

22

certain counties in Virginia had such an expectation but

23

did not in other counties, because most citizens don't

know the sophisticated aspects of the Virginia law.

that there was no authority to search the car, simply

because it was impounded, and we said the question here

is not whether the search was authorized by State law;

the question is rather whether the search was a

25

reasonable one under the Fourth Amendment.

The State court had said

45

Just as a search authorized by State law may

be an unreasonable one under that amendment, so may a

justified as a constitutional reasonable one.

an exclusionary rule for the violation of its law?

11

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Assuming the Court decides

12

that the question was not waived because it wasn't

briefed, the reason is that this Court's exclusionary

14

rule precedents look to something else, and that is:

15

Did the evidence follow directly from the

unconstitutional conduct?

17

And here it did.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

question would be:

whether there's an arrest also look to something else,

rather than whether it's permitted or violated under

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, I think

that illustrates the point I am willing to accept, and

5

that is there are times that State law is relevant under

6

this Court's doctrines; there are times it isn't.

Court looks squarely to the State law of whether and how

2

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

The reason is I think the

3

one -- that the Court has never looked to the State law

4

remedies in Di Re, Miller, Johnson, Ker, and DeFillippo,

5

and that it looks to what the common law would look to,

6

which is:

7

Is the arrest legal or not?
I also would repeat what I said to Justice

8

Breyer, and that is I would not assume that Virginia

believes that the exclusionary rule wouldn't apply

because those precedents trigger the Fourth Amendment.

to your question about, okay, Whren.

things about whether people can be arrested are

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. McCULLOUGH

13

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

14

MR. McCULLOUGH:

Thank you.

15

First, when counsel says that this is some

16

kind of a unique Virginia statute, that's wrong.

17

brief filed by the ABA shows that all but nine States

18

have enacted provisions that are similar, that involve

19

restrictions on their officers' authority, and each of

20

those has exceptions, and so on and so forth.

21

So it is not a unique situation.

The

You have

22

clear rules.

23

An arrest is constitutional if the officers have

24

probable cause to believe a crime has been committed.

25

Why would you trade them in for a morass?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Any crime at all?

I'm sorry?
Any crime at all;

jaywalking, for example?

MR. McCULLOUGH:

That's -- that's correct.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

We would never know about

it if the -- if the misdemeanor, or jaywalking offense,

7

was not committed in the officer's presence.

Atwater did not reach the in-the-presence

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So -

Mr. McCullough, what is

18

here, for some reason the Commonwealth did not cite

Cooper v. California, which I can't understand unless

20

you agree with your friend that it has been overruled by

21

later cases.

We certainly think it strongly -- as the

And as the lower courts have noted when

6

facing a similar argument, you've already held that when

7

it comes to a search, that under Greenwood and Cooper,

8

that State-law considerations aren't going to be what

9

the constitutional inquiry turns on.

10

Why would you have this incongruity where

11

that's true in Greenwood and Cooper with a search of a

12

residence or an automobile but then you have a different

rule when it comes to an arrest?

15

The States have been

And the State here has never held, going

16

back to 1924, that a violation of State law rises to the

17

level of a constitutional arrest and -- or, excuse me -

18

20

exclusionary rule at the State level.

There was a violation of state law, but it wasn't a

constitutional problem.

judgment below.

Mr. McCullough, there is
