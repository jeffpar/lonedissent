ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY K. HAYNES

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. HAYNES:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The plain English reading of Section 2501 of

12

Title 28, its phrasing compared to the jurisdictional

13

grants to the Court of Federal Claims, the

14

contemporaneous legal history of its predecessor, and

15

this Court's decisions in Irwin and Franconia Associates

16

compel the conclusion that Section 2501 does not limit

17

subject matter jurisdiction and should be applied to the

18

government as an ordinary waivable affirmative defense.

19

The plain text of Section 2501, which reads

20

"Every claim of which the United States Court of Federal

21

Claims has jurisdiction shall be barred unless the

22

petition thereon is filed within 6 years" after it first

23

accrues, assumes subject matter jurisdiction, and if it

24

assumes subject matter jurisdiction it cannot logically

25

limit subject matter jurisdiction.
3
Alderson Reporting Company

The statute is

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

phrased in such a way that the jurisdictional inquiry

2

precedes the inquiry as to timeliness.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

Did the prior statutes have

a different structure?

5

MR. HAYNES:

The -

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We've held this thing is

7

jurisdictional for a long time.

8

under which we made those holdings have a different

9

structure?

10

MR. HAYNES:

Did the prior statutes

The 1863 statute prior to the

11

Tucker Act amendment to the statute had approximately

12

the same structure, Your Honor, yes.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Are you asking us

14

to, or you think we have to, to rule in your favor

15

overrule our decisions in Kendall and Soriano?

16

MR. HAYNES:

Your Honor, we believe that

17

this Court's decision in Irwin effectively overruled

18

Soriano.

19

limitations was subject to equitable tolling, and in

20

Irwin, the Court had to choose between two lines of

21

cases, Soriano and Bowen v. City of New York.

22

chose the Bowen line of cases.

23

Soriano -- Soriano of course held that Section 2501 is

24

jurisdictional.

25

Irwin held that the Title 7 statute of

And it

And so if it repudiated

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Of course, Irwin

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

involved Title 7 and not this 2501.

2

addressed Title 7 before, but we have addressed 2501

3

before.

4

MR. HAYNES:

And we hadn't

That's correct.

But certainly

5

in Irwin, the Court uses 2501 as an example of a statute

6

that can be equitably tolled and in -

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, in, in the

8

more recent case of Kontrick -- I'm looking at footnote

9

8 of that opinion -- it used 2401 as an example of the

10

jurisdictional bar and 2401 has pretty much the same

11

language as 2501.

12
13
14

MR. HAYNES:

Yes, Section 2401 in the

Federal Tort Claims Act has similar language.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think in Contracts it

15

was used as an example of a so-called built-in statute

16

of limitations, one that is thought to bar the right as

17

well as the remedy.

18

MR. HAYNES:

Well, certainly one could look

19

at the statute of limitations in 2401 that is within the

20

section that waives sovereign immunity and say that it

21

as part of the waiver constitutes a limit on subject

22

matter jurisdiction.

23

alone in the procedural chapter concerning the Court of

24

Federal Claims is not attached to any particular waiver

25

contained in chapter 91, which contains the

However, Section 2501 standing

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

jurisdictional grants to the Court of Federal Claims.

2

So -

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, just, just to

4

get all the cases out on the table, our more recent

5

decision in Bowles suggested that there may be a

6

difference between statutory and rule limitations and

7

also suggested that the prior history of the

8

interpretation of a provision was highly relevant.

9

MR. HAYNES:

Yes, Bowles does say that, but

10

Bowles can be distinguished, I believe, in several ways.

11

First, Bowles dealt with the notice of claim, notice of

12

appeal and transferring the jurisdiction from the

13

district court to the court of appeals.

14

issue here because in the statute of limitations, of

15

course, we aren't dealing with transferring

16

jurisdiction, we're dealing with the initiation, the

17

initiation of the claim and which court that claim

18

belongs in, not transferring jurisdiction from one to

19

another.

20

That's not at

Second, Bowles -- Bowles was very careful in

21

not mentioning statutes of limitations in, in the

22

majority opinion.

23

think that is, that is purposeful.

24
25

It doesn't mention it at all and I

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It said determining when

and under what conditions Federal courts can hear cases

falls within the court's adjudicatory authority -- or

2

3

4

5

say that.

6
7
8
9

That would be very broad, but it did

Could not interfere with the plain-text
reading of 2501 once you assume JUSTICE ALITO:

What kind of language would

we have to find in 2501 in order to conclude that it's

10

jurisdictional?

11

to say that there is no jurisdiction unless the -- the

12

claim is filed within a certain period of time?

13

Would it be necessary for the statute

MR. HAYNES:

I think if Congress said that

14

-- if Congress specifically said that this section, this

15

statute of limitations, is jurisdictional, that would

16

end the issue.

17

in the Arbaugh case, if Congress plainly establishes a

18

statute as jurisdictional, then the court's -

19
20
21

And as this case -- as this Court said

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is that necessary?

Is there

anything short of that that would be sufficient?
MR. HAYNES:

If Section -- if the language

22

in Section 2501 were attached to the waiver of sovereign

23

immunity in 1491(a)(1) for this case, that might allow

24

the Court to find that it's jurisdictional and -

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then there would be a

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

built-in limitation, and usually that's not considered

2

jurisdictional.

3

failure to state a claim; that is, your claim has been

4

extinguished, so you have no claim to state, as opposed

5

to the ordinary operation of the statute of limitations

6

which bars only the remedy, not the right.

7

It would be under the heading of

MR. HAYNES:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

But

8

certainly the example -- as the Chief Justice's example

9

suggested, in 2401, the Federal Tort Claims Act, and

10

also the statute that's found in the Quiet Title Act

11

that this Court interpreted in the Block case, Block v.

12

North Dakota, those statutes of limitations are attached

13

to the jurisdictional grant in some closer fashion than

14

2501 is, and so they would more likely to be read to be

15

a limit on jurisdiction.

16

I think -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It seems to me all of those

17

factors are a lot more subtle than the mere fact that we

18

have said that this is jurisdictional for years and

19

years, it and its predecessor.

20

least as persuasive as the -- as the fragile attachments

21

you're -- you're discussing here or even as the -- as

22

the, you know, the -- even if the statute said that it's

23

jurisdictional, we've said in our opinions that to say

24

it's jurisdictional doesn't mean that it's

25

jurisdictional necessarily.

Why -- why isn't that at

So I suppose we could say
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the same about the statute, couldn't we?

2

MR. HAYNES:

Justice Scalia, I believe that

3

the Irwin case answers that question because Irwin

4

certainly undercut Soriano and Soriano relied on the

5

Kendall-Finn line of cases.

6

chose to say that the statute of limitations in Title 7

7

and generally other statutes of limitation are presumed

8

to be equitably tollable, and if they are equitably

9

tollable they cannot be jurisdictional.

10

2501 was used

--

11
12

Irwin made a choice, and it

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It didn't say that.

You're

saying that.

13

MR. HAYNES:

Yes, we are saying that.

14

think that there is a logic -

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We

Bowles said that.
Yes.
Bowles said if it's

18

equitably tolled, it's not jurisdictional.

19

provision that is jurisdictional cannot be equitably

20

tolled.

21

MR. HAYNES:

That's correct.

If it -- a

And if it -

22

if the statute can be equitably tolled, it's not

23

jurisdictional, and therefore it can be waived and -

24

and it does not have to be raised sua sponte by the

25

court, as was done here by the Federal Circuit.
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

One member of the court

2

did think that Irvin -- Irwin overruled Soriano, but

3

only one member.

4

MR. HAYNES:

Yes, but I think a -- a fair

5

reading of Irwin, combined with this Court's decision in

6

Franconia Associates, which construed Section 2501 to

7

say that it doesn't have a special accrual rule for the

8

government and that this Court -- or that courts should

9

apply statutes of limitations against the government as

10

against private parties -

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's a pretty risky

12

business, though, to rely on a dissent in determining

13

whether a majority overruled the prior precedent or not,

14

isn't it?

15
16
17
18

MR. HAYNES:

It would be, Your Honor.

not sure which case you're referring to.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Irwin.

I thought

that was the one Justice Ginsburg posed to you -

19

MR. HAYNES:

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.
-- where Justice

21

White in dissent said that Irwin overruled Soriano.

22

the majority certainly didn't say that.

23

I'm

MR. HAYNES:

But

No, but -- it did not say that

24

specifically, but I think if you look at Irwin in the

25

totality, there is -- I don't think there is a way that
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you could look at Irwin and say that it did not overrule

2

Soriano.

3

theoretical underpinnings for the Soriano line of cases.

4

Because -

5

At a minimum -- at a minimum, it took out the

JUSTICE BREYER:

How do you suggest we write

6

the opinion?

If you were writing it and then a dissent,

7

say, or someone or we read in the briefs that here is an

8

absolute holding of the Supreme Court right on point,

9

totally clear, says just exactly what the government

10

says here, and it was codified in 1948, and now we say

11

the reason, despite that, you win is?

12

MR. HAYNES:

The reason is because, unless

13

the Congress clearly establishes a statute of

14

limitations as jurisdictional, unless there is a clear

15

statement, then statutes of limitations against the

16

government are to be read -

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

And if somebody says, well,

18

the Court couldn't have been clearer as to what the

19

statute meant, and Congress reenacted it in codifying

20

it.

So what do you want?

21

MR. HAYNES:

Well -

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, what could be

23

clearer?

Are they supposed to actually -- in the

24

recodification in 19 -- or is it that the recodification

25

changed things or what?
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. HAYNES:

No, Justice Breyer, I don't

2

think the recodification changed the substance of the

3

statute.

4

Congress's recodification of this Court's ruling in the

5

Kendall-Finn line of cases cuts both ways because

6

following Irwin, issued in -- when the opinion was

7

issued in 1990, the Congress has had 17 years to look at

8

that and say no, Section 2501 should not be equitably

9

tolled.

However, certainly that argument that

And Congress certainly could say that.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

recodified 2501 in the past 17 years, has it?

12

MR. HAYNES:

But it hasn't

That's correct, Mr. Chief

13

Justice.

14

really -- really is not a telling argument because the

15

Kendall-Finn line of cases, under Irwin at least, were

16

wrongly decided when they were decided.

17
18

However, I think the recodification argument

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. HAYNES:

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24
25

I think in order to Or at least say that

we already did in Irwin?

22
23

So you think we do

have to overrule Kendall and Soriano?

21

So -

MR. HAYNES:

Yes, Your Honor.

We believe

that.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:
whole line of cases?

Is it just Irwin or a

There was a time when the
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

jurisdictional label was used rather frequently.

2

is a more recent case that says "jurisdiction" is a word

3

of many meanings, too many meanings.

4

Court has been trying to cut down on the too many

5

meanings.

6

MR. HAYNES:

There

And I think the

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, I agree,

7

and those cases start with the Kontrick v. Ryan case and

8

continue through -- and even in the Bowles case, that's

9

-- that's a species of appellate jurisdiction which -

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

But even all those cases

11

which you're going back to, what you're talking about, I

12

think, in those cases is general statements in the case.

13

The cases themselves, except possibly for that

14

Franconia, which has a different problem because it was

15

about accrual, the cases themselves don't involve this

16

statute.

17

and I'd like your response, that in this Court's opinion

18

as in statutes, as in life.

19

statements, they don't mean every possible situation in

20

the universe; rather, there are always circumstances to

21

which the statement doesn't apply.

22

just read those statements as incorporating a prior

23

explicit holding of the Court as inapplicable to that

24

prior explicit holding?

25

normally do with a sentence like that, isn't it?

It's simply general statements.

I thought,

When people make general

And so why don't we

I mean, that's what you'd

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. HAYNES:

Perhaps, Justice Breyer.

I

2

think that the rule that we are proposing here is that

3

once Congress has waived sovereign immunity, absent a

4

clear statement of Congress to the contrary, a statute

5

of limitations is not -- does not limit subject matter

6

jurisdiction.

7

plain language of Section 2501, compared to the

8

jurisdictional grant here in 1491(a)(1).

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So I think the Court has to look at the

Was the rule or the

10

presumption that you just quoted in effect when Congress

11

last revised the statute?

12

MR. HAYNES:

No, Justice Kennedy.

I think

13

the presumption was -- was established certainly in

14

Irwin, which said:

15

decisions that we have been going through on this

16

question of equitable tolling.

17

create a general rule that statutes of limitations

18

generally are presumed to be equitably tolled.

19

We want to cut through these ad hoc

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We want to -- we want to

But you can -- was

20

Congress aware of that general rule when it last revised

21

the statute?

22
23
24
25

MR. HAYNES:

I don't see how that could

happen, Justice Kennedy.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I don't, either, and

that's why, when you say, well, it's a general rule,
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

well, your argument tends to lose force because of the

2

fact that Congress acts against the background of what

3

this Court has stated.

4

MR. HAYNES:

That may be.

However, I don't

5

think that that general codification or -- or, rather,

6

the rule of statutory construction that says that the

7

Congress's codification of the law will then incorporate

8

this Court's prior decisions, I don't think that can

9

trump the plain language reading of the statute.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Haynes, isn't it less

11

radical and, indeed, more in accord with the language of

12

Irwin to -- to say that what Irwin overruled was not the

13

whole principle that this statute of limitation is -- is

14

-- and others that relate to sovereign immunity, is

15

jurisdictional, but rather the much more limited rule

16

that -- that statutes of limitations which are

17

jurisdictional are not subject to equitable tolling?

18

That's a much more limited point, and -- and

19

the language of Irwin is a waiver of sovereign immunity

20

must be unequivocally expressed once Congress has made

21

such a -- once Congress has made such a waiver, we think

22

that making the rule of equitable tolling applicable to

23

suits against the government in the same way that it is

24

applicable to private suits amounts to little, if any -

25

little, if any -- broadening of the congressional
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

waiver.
I don't think one can say that if you expand

3

the principle to cover the whole -- the whole matter of

4

whether it's jurisdiction.

5

moderately to -- to -- if we have to overrule one of two

6

things, the whole doctrine of the jurisdictional nature

7

of statutes of limitations in sovereign immunity cases

8

and the other is simply, oh, yes, there is sovereign

9

immunity, but can there be equitable tolling, why

10
11

So why not read Irwin more

shouldn't we adopt the more limited one?
MR. HAYNES:

Well, I think, Justice Scalia,

12

that this Court can adopt a more limited ruling based

13

upon the rule that I've advanced, and that is if

14

Congress specifically says that a statute of limitations

15

shall count as jurisdictional.

16

And the example I would give, Justice

17

Scalia, is in the Indian Tucker Act, which is found on

18

page 9A of the appendix to the blue brief.

19

Tucker Act, Section 1505 -- excuse me -- section 1505,

20

says that claims that accrue to Indians after August 13,

21

1946, go to the Court of Federal Claims.

22

Federal Claims has jurisdiction over those claims.

23

The Indian

The Court of

That is -- and before that date, such Indian

24

claims went to the Indian Claims Commission.

25

Congress said before a date certain a particular forum
16
Alderson Reporting Company

So in 1505

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

had jurisdiction; and after a date certain another forum

2

has jurisdiction.

3

kind of date that I think is -- is appropriate to look

4

at here, because once -- once you put an -- you put

5

accrual language in a statute of limitations, that by

6

its nature suggests that there may be equitable tolling

7

or some kind of tolling if you're talking about a claim

8

accruing, because there may be estoppel, there may be

9

waivers, there may be discovery issues.

That's -- that's a jurisdictional

So the text of

10

the statute itself suggests that there is a form of

11

tolling allowed in the statute.

12

And if Congress wanted to say that this

13

statute of limitations goes to the subject matter

14

jurisdiction of the court, it very well could have said

15

that.

16

comfortably within the rule that we are suggesting.

17

It didn't, however; and so I think Irwin fits

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's exactly

18

what I think we said in -- in Arbaugh; and that,

19

certainly, going forward from that point on, Congress

20

has more or less specified that it's jurisdictional, or

21

we're not going to read it that way.

22

that was the rule in Irwin and I'm pretty sure it wasn't

23

the rule in Soriano and Kendall.

24
25

MR. HAYNES:

But I'm not sure

Mr. Chief Justice, it certainly

was not the rule in Soriano and Kendall.
17
Alderson Reporting Company

But our

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

position is that in Kendall the Court ignored the

2

legislative history which said, this statute of

3

limitations that we are inserting into the 1863 Court of

4

Claims Act should be treated -- should be applied to the

5

government just as to private parties.

6

That's precisely the ruling in Franconia

7

Associates:

8

waived, once -- once there is a waiver of sovereign

9

immunity, the government is treated like any other

10

That once sovereign immunity has been

defendant.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, I know, but it

12

seems to me you're arguing that if Kendall came up

13

today, it would be decided differently, and maybe that's

14

right.

15

But the point is it came up 100 years ago

16

and it was decided, and the question is whether we

17

should overturn that decision.

18

MR. HAYNES:

I understand.

Again, I suggest

19

that Irwin erased the theoretical underpinnings of the

20

Kendall-Finn line of cases by saying that a statute

21

formerly -- which this Court formerly said was

22

jurisdictional can be subject to equitable tolling, and

23

if it is subject to equitable tolling it cannot be

24

jurisdictional because the hallmarks of "jurisdictional"

25

are strict construction, it can't be waived and
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

forfeited, and it has to be raised sua sponte.

2

if you take out one of those legs of the statute, I

3

don't see how it can be held to the jurisdictional.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so

It did say statutory time

5

limits -- this is Irwin -- applicable to lawsuits -

equitable tolling applicable to suits against the

government.

It says the rule that was announced is

to private parties.
So it's hard to think of what territory

12

Irwin would cover if it doesn't -- because in all suits,

13

at least for money against the government, there has to

14

be a waiver of sovereign immunity.

15

MR. HAYNES:

That's true, Justice Ginsburg.

16

And -- and Congress has specifically waived sovereign

17

immunity for the kind of claim involved in this case,

18

which is, of course, a takings claim.

19

Once the waiver is accomplished, the

20

government is treated like any other defendant.

21

certainly what Franconia Associates says, and I think it

22

is inescapable to say, to -- to conclude other than to

23

say that Irwin and Franconia have -- have eviscerated

24

the Kendall-Finn line of cases.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
19
Alderson Reporting Company

That's

Well, I think your

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

argument is more strongly supported by Irwin than

2

Franconia.

3

which doesn't go to what the jurisdictional effect of

4

the bar on commencing a case is.

5

Franconia simply involved an accrual rule,

The government there was overreaching and

6

arguing for a special accrual rule, and the Court said

7

no.

8

time for commencing litigation is jurisdictional or not.

That's different than saying whether the actual

9

MR. HAYNES:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that's

10

correct.

11

Franconia reiterated the Irwin rule, which is that once

12

sovereign immunity is waived the statute of limitations

13

applies to the government.

14

That's what Franconia ruled.

However,

The government in Franconia, as you say, was

15

pressing a very novel interpretation of the

16

first-accrued language, and the Court said the

17

government doesn't get any advantage from that just

18

because it's the government.

19

So just because the -- the government is the

20

defendant doesn't mean that it has that special

21

advantage once sovereign immunity is waived, as it has

22

been here.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Even if -- even if you're

24

right, couldn't the Federal Circuit say:

25

all very interesting but Day v. McDonough told us that
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Well, that's

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

if we want to raise it on our own -- we don't have to if

2

it's not jurisdictional; but if we want to, we can.

3

MR. HAYNES:

Justice Ginsburg, I think Day

4

v. McDonough does not help the government here.

Day v.

5

McDonough said that, yes, in the habeas situation the

6

district court might raise sua sponte the timeliness of

7

the claim.

8

on this, and the three-member dissent was also crystal

9

clear on this:

What the Court was -- the majority was clear

That if the government waives the

10

statute of limitations, the Court would not have -- it

11

would be an abuse of discretion for the Court to

12

override that waiver.

13

So, Day v. McDonough actually helps our

14

position.

15

-- but there was, for lack of a better word, a super

16

waiver, because the government, having raised the

17

statute of limitations in its pleadings, having moved to

18

dismiss on the basis of the statute of limitations, then

19

in special briefing asked by the trial judge here agreed

20

that the claim was filed timely and conceded that in the

21

Federal Circuit.

22

that the claim was filed timely.

23

Because not only was there a waiver here as

They not only waived it, they agreed

So, Day v.

McDonough, I think, helps our

24

position and not the government's position.

25

was made emphatically clear by at least eight members of
21
Alderson Reporting Company

And that

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this Court in Day v. McDonough, the majority and the

2

three-member dissent.

3

One other point I'd like to make, and that

4

is that if this Court holds that the statute of -- that

5

2501 is jurisdictional, then the judges in the Court of

6

Federal Claims for every case filed in front of them on

7

their general jurisdiction docket have to -- will have

8

to scrutinize the allegations in every complaint to

9

determine if the complaint is -- has been timely filed.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, that -- that assumes

11

that the government has waived in every case.

12

hasn't waived, I have to do it anyway.

13
14

MR. HAYNES:
Kennedy.

15

If it

That's correct, Justice

You can usually count on

the government to file the canned sovereign immunity

brief.

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. HAYNES:

I think that's correct, Justice

20

Scalia.

You can count on the government to file a

21

canned affirmative defense to the statute of

22

limitations, too.

23

But that's true, Justice Kennedy, if the

24

government has, has waived it then the court doesn't

25

have to, wouldn't have to do that.
22
Alderson Reporting Company

If they -- excuse

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

me, if they raise it, the government doesn't have to -

2

I'm sorry.

3
4

If the government raises JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If they, if they raise the

defense -

5

MR. HAYNES:

Right.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- then you're going to

7

have to determine it anyway, subject to clearly

8

erroneous findings of fact, as to when the person

9

entered the property and so forth.

10

MR. HAYNES:

That's correct.

11

But even if, even if the government were to

12

agree that the claim was timely filed, the judges would

13

have to consider it sua sponte in every case.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but that's

15

like saying in every diversity case, theoretically, the

16

court has to scrutinize whether someone who alleges they

17

are a citizen of Pennsylvania really is.

18

just not the way it really happens.

19

usually, if not raised by the party, comes up under some

20

other situation, such as in this case the amicus raised

21

it.

22

MR. HAYNES:

And that's

The question

That's correct.

But even if

23

it's not raised, we think that if the statute is held

24

jurisdictional, then the courts have to address it sua

25

sponte.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

8
9

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

In a consistent line of decisions beginning

11

in 1883, this Court has repeatedly construed the 6-year

12

filing requirement contained in Section 2501 and its

13

predecessors as a nonwaivable jurisdictional limit on

14

the Court of Claim's authority to enter money judgments

language in minor respects.

Congress has recodified the

Mr. Stewart, can I ask you

this question:

21

equitable tolling would be available under this statute?

22

Do you think the defense of the

MR. STEWART:

We don't, Your Honor.

In

23

fact, the Court has held both in Kendall and in Soriano

24

that equitable tolling is not available.

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You don't think Irwin even

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

changed the equitable tolling rule?

2

MR. STEWART:

We don't.

Irwin read in the

3

way we would read it, established that at least with

4

respect to statutes that provided for private suits

5

against both governmental and private defendants, and

6

perhaps with respect to suits against the government

7

generally, that there is a presumption of equitable

8

tolling.

9

presumption could be rebutted.

But the Court in Irwin recognized that that
And in both Kendall and

10

Soriano, the Court had relied on, inter alia, the fact

11

that the statute listed specific instances in which the

12

6-year period could be tolled as evidence that there was

no general authority to toll the statutory time limit.

against the government"?

25

for Soriano there?

Is there an implied exception

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. STEWART:

I think there are two bases on

2

which we would distinguish that language.

The first is

3

by its terms Chief Justice Rehnquist's sentence was

4

addressed to equitable tolling, not to waivibility.

5

it's true that the Court in Bowles has linked the two,

6

but it doesn't appear that the Court in Irwin made that

7

equation.

8

recited the fact that both the district court and the

9

court of appeals had ordered the case dismissed for lack

And

That is, in the Irwin opinion the Court

10

of jurisdiction, because the filing requirement had not

11

been met.

12

is subject to -

13

And the Court said, we think that the statute

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I understand, I think I

14

understand what you're saying, but I thought that the

15

government's distinction of Soriano was that was the

16

general rule for equitable tolling, so it doesn't apply

17

here, which I think is certainly understandable.

18

you're saying it wasn't even a general rule for

19

equitable tolling?

20

MR. STEWART:

But

It was at least a general rule

21

for equitable tolling with respect to statutes like

22

Title 7 that authorize suit against both the government

23

and against private defendants.

24

back and forth in the Court since then as to whether the

25

Irwin language extends more broadly.

And there has been some

26
Alderson Reporting Company

In Brockamp, the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Court suggested that some private analog is necessary

2

before the Irwin presumption applies.

3

versus Principi, the Court seemed to tilt in the

4

opposite direction.

5

In Scarborough

But part of our point is, even if the Irwin

6

presumption of equitable tolling extends categorically

7

to all suits against the government, equitable tolling

8

is not the same thing as jurisdictionality or

9

waivibility.

The Court in Bowles did link the two, but

10

in Irwin itself the Court recited the fact that the

11

lower courts had dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

12

And then when the Court concluded that Irwin

13

had not satisfied the prerequisites for equitable

14

tolling, the Court simply said:

15

Affirmed.

Now, if the Court had intended in Irwin to

16

establish not simply that equitable tolling was

17

potentially available, but that the time limit was not a

18

jurisdictional bar to begin with, it seems likely the

19

Court would at least have referred to the idea that the

20

dismissal should have been for failure -

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You know, I don't -

22

it's -- we've found it difficult enough to figure out

23

which statutes are jurisdictional and which are not.

24

And now you want us to say, well, even if it's

25

jurisdictional, the consequences may be different for
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

jurisdiction and for equitable tolling and for

2

waivibility.

3

difficult argument.

4

I mean, it seems to me that's a very

MR. STEWART:

Well, the Court has said both

5

with respect to Section 2501 and its predecessors and

6

with respect to statutory time limits for suing the

7

government generally, that the terms of Congress's

8

consent to suit define the jurisdiction of the reviewing

9

court and a time limit for commencing suit is one of

10

those terms.

11

in particular to United States v. Dalm, which is cited

12

in our brief on page 23.

13

months before Irwin was decided.

14

Dalm is suffused with references to the jurisdictional

15

character of the time limit for commencing suit against

16

the government.

17

And I would direct the Court's attention

It was decided less than 9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the opinion in

But you certainly would

18

be mixing categories terribly if you suggested that

19

something that goes to the court's authority to proceed

20

in the case can be waived if it's equitable to waive it.

21

I mean, those two notions are at odds with each other.

22

MR. STEWART:

Obviously, the government was

23

on the other side in Irwin, so in a sense I'm not the

24

best person to defend the Court's reasoning.

25

between the reading of Irwin that would create this
28
Alderson Reporting Company

But as

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

anomaly, that there could potentially be a

2

jurisdictional limit that was nevertheless subject to

3

equitable tolling, and the argument on the other side

4

that Irwin sub silentio swept away numerous decisions of

5

this Court that had recited that the, that the terms of

6

the government's consent to suit are jurisdictional

7

limits and a time limit is one of those terms.

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, what would, what

would Irwin and Franconia that made statements -- when

10

it's a question of a time limit, they operate against

11

the government just like they operate against private

12

parties, to what kind of case would that apply?

13

it's been pointed out that 2501 covers a whole slew of

14

cases, not just takings cases.

15

MR. STEWART:

I mean,

Well, certainly the kind of

16

case that the Court was specifically dealing with in

17

Irwin itself, and it's not an uncommon type of case now,

18

is one in which Congress has passed a statute that

19

imposes obligations on private parties and then imposes

20

like obligations on the government.

21

Title 7, once it was amended to add the Federal

22

Government as a potential defendant and to impose the

23

substantive obligations on the government, was that the

24

government was to be dealt with with respect to matters

25

of employment discrimination in the same way that a
29
Alderson Reporting Company

And the gestalt of

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

private employer would be in like circumstances, and -

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I suppose Franconia

3

would be a case where the Irwin logic not only would but

4

did apply.

5

MR. STEWART:

Well, in Franconia, the Court

6

was dealing with a different question.

It was what do

7

the words "first accrues" mean?

8

it essentially treated the phrase "first accrues" as a

9

term of art, as one that had appeared in prior statutes

And it held that the -

10

governing suits against other defendants.

11

no reason to believe that Congress intended those words

12

to mean anything different in Section 2501 than they

13

meant in other statutes of limitations.

14

And so it saw

And I guess the other point that I would

15

make both about Franconia and Irwin is, even if you read

16

Irwin at its broadest, even if you construe it to mean

17

that there is a presumption that time limits for suing

18

the government are nonjurisdictional as well as subject

19

to tolling, the Court in Irwin still made clear that the

20

presumption could be rebutted.

The presumption is not a

21

limit on Congress's authority.

It's simply an aid to

22

construction in situations where other tools of

23

interpretation don't produce a clear result.

24

we would say -

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And here

Let me ask this question,

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Mr. Stewart.

2

all, just the whole -- this is the first time this issue

3

had arisen, and we have the plain language of this

4

statute.

background, supporting your opponent?

6

Supposing we didn't have any precedent at

Would you not read this statute, without any

MR. STEWART:

We wouldn't read it to -- if

7

all we had was the text of the statute, we would not

8

read it to permit waiver.

9

The statute is reproduced in pertinent part at page 2 of

And I should explain why.

10

the government's brief.

And the statute provides "Every

11

claim of which the United States" -- "Every claim of

12

which the United States Court of Federal Claims has

13

jurisdiction shall be barred unless the petition thereon

14

is filed within 6 years after such claim first accrues."

15

And looking only at the text of the statute,

16

the language is categorical.

It says every claim that

The statute by its terms makes no exception for

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Aren't statutes of

limitations generally more equivocal than that?
MR. STEWART:

No.

I think often statutes of

23

limitations are written like that.

But my point is in

24

the end Petitioner's argument really is not a plain

25

language argument.

Petitioner's argument 31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE STEVENS:

When you read the plain

2

language, you left out the words, "of which the United

3

States Court of Claims has jurisdiction."

4

MR. STEWART:

I can understand that if you

5

were looking only at the language of the statute, you

6

would say -- you might say this is not a jurisdictional

7

bar because it presumes jurisdiction.

8

JUSTICE STEVENS:

9

MR. STEWART:

Yes.

But with respect to the

10

substantive question presented, namely whether the

11

United States' failure to make the argument in a timely

12

way causes it to be waived, the statute doesn't support

13

Petitioner's position as to that.

14

It doesn't by its terms carve out an exception for cases

15

in which the United States fails to raise a -

It is categorical.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

the rules of the Court of Federal Claims?

18

states that the statute of limitations is an affirmative

19

defense.

20

because that's all the Court of Federal Claims deals

21

with.

22

What about -- what about
Rule 8(c)

And that's in suits against the Government

So to what would that Rule 8(c) apply?
MR. STEWART:

Rule 8(c) says the following

23

affirmative defenses shall be pled in the responsive

24

proceeding, and it lists statute of limitations.

25

think it could certainly --

it obviously couldn't

32
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

supersede the decisions of this Court or even of the

2

Federal Circuit -

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But all those statutes of

4

limitations would be statutes of limitations operating

5

against the government.

6

MR. STEWART:

I think the rule basically

7

tracks, although not precisely tracks, the language of

8

the -- the parallel Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, and

9

we would read it simply to mean to the extent this is an

10

affirmative defense, it should be pleaded initially.

11

doesn't say that the defense is waived if not pleaded.

It

12

But to return to the point that I was making

13

earlier, in the end Petitioner's argument is not a plain

14

language argument.

15

notwithstanding the absence on the face of the statute

16

of an exception for cases in which the United States

17

fails to plead the timeliness defense, this Court should

18

read Section 2501 against the backdrop of a large body

19

of law holding that statutes of limitations are

20

generally waivable, and should assume that Congress

21

intended to incorporate that understanding -

22

Petitioner's argument is that,

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, that isn't -- I don't

23

think it's quite -- putting the argument as I understand

24

it, you would say let's look at Irwin, and we read it,

25

so it's in your mind.

Now think of that set of statute
33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of limitations, the Federal ones, the Government ones,

2

that are either just as ambiguous as Irwin or even more

3

ambiguous.

4

Think of that set.
Now, in Irwin the Court says in the absence

5

of special circumstances that whole set is going to be

6

interpreted as nonjurisdictional.

7

So you say, well, what Irwin didn't talk about is

8

suppose there's a member of that set where previously

9

the Court had held it was jurisdictional.

10

tell us what to do.

11

shall we not?

12

That's what it says.

It doesn't

Shall we read it as an exception or

And so what they are saying is, don't read

13

it as an exception.

14

probably never really thought about any of this stuff.

15

Read it, Irwin, as including that one, too.

16

There's no need to do so.

Congress

So what do you think of that point, whether

17

it's theirs or not, leaving aside the argument about

18

whether this particular statute does or does not fall

19

within that set?

20

Assume it does.

MR. STEWART:

Well, I think -- I think this

21

essentially relates to the point that I was making that,

22

even if there is a presumption of nonjurisdictionality

23

announced in Irwin, it's rebuttable and the presumption

24

is simply an aid to construction.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Absolutely right, and then

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the question is does the simple fact that we previously

2

held to the contrary count as a rebuttal?

3

mean to -- see that's the same question I had before, so

4

what do you think about that?

5
6

MR. STEWART:

In our view, yes, it does.

That is -

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MR. STEWART:

9

Does Irwin

Because?

It's a little artificial to

talk about what language Congress might or should have

10

used in light of Irwin to make clear its intent that

11

this be treated as jurisdictional, when Congress in the

12

1948 Judicial Code chose to recodify essentially the

13

same language that had previously been construed to

14

impose a jurisdictional limit.

15

making before about Petitioner's argument as to imputed

16

congressional intent -- in the end Petitioner's position

17

depends on the inference that because there was a body

18

of law out there saying that statutes of limitations are

19

ordinarily waivable, Congress should be assumed to have

20

intended to incorporate that body of law.

21

And the point I was

And our point is if you're trying to impute

22

Congress's intent it makes much more sense to assume

23

that Congress intended to recodify the same reading that

24

this Court had attached to this particular provision,

25

not that Congress intended to incorporate a meaning that
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the Court had attached to other statutes of limitations

2

that the Court had specifically distinguished from this

3

one.

4

And it's worth emphasizing that the

5

decisions in Kendall and Finn and De Arnaud can't be

6

accused of the sort of loose or less than meticulous use

7

of jurisdictional language that this Court has recently

8

--

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Would you say that

10

Franconia did use loose language, because although it

11

dealt with accrual -- when does the claim accrue, and

12

not when is it cut off -- but it did say, it called 2501

13

specifically "an unexceptional statute of limitations."

14

MR. STEWART:

It said that it was

15

unexceptional and it said that many other statutes of

16

limitations used this language, namely the phrase "first

17

accrues."

18

Franconia attached significance to was the fact that the

19

Court of Claims had never given that phrase a broader

20

reading in Section 2501.

21

as additional evidence that the phase had not been

22

understood in this particular statute to bear a meaning

23

other than it would have in other statutes of

24

limitations.

25

But one of the other points that the Court in

That is, the Court cited that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And if we looked at the

36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Court of Federal Claims decisions now, I think they're

2

spelled out in the opinion.

3

That is, some say 2501 is jurisdictional, some say it's

4

not.

5

MR. STEWART:

They go both directions.

I think the principal line of

6

authority in the Federal Circuit says it's

7

jurisdictional, but what can't be disputed is that this

8

Court has said over and over that it's jurisdictional,

9

and the Court has again not used those -- that term in

10

passing.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, because it said it in

12

a case -- the issue in the case was whether Franconia

13

was overruled -- I mean, Soriano was overruled.

14

Justice White thought it was.

15

words.

16

the majority didn't disagree with that.

17

cited Justice White's dissent as part of his description

18

of why some statutes are different from others, then

19

comes to the points that we want to adopt a general rule

20

that applies to all statutes.

21

the implicit -- in his opinion he did not disagree with

22

Justice White's characterization.

23

And

He said so in so many

And it's interesting that Justice Rehnquist in

MR. STEWART:

Rather, he

So it seems to me that

Well, I think it would be -

24

again, given the fact in particular that the Court in

25

Irwin didn't speak explicitly to the question of
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

jurisdictionality one way or the other, I think it is

2

not uncommon for a -- a dissenting opinion to make

3

assertions about the reach of a majority opinion, and

4

the majority opinion sometimes does and sometimes does

5

not respond to those.

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But the interesting part

7

about this is the discussion of the majority of this

8

case is part of its development of the fact that we've

9

got cases all over the lot and we want to adopt a clear

10

rule to apply across the board.

11

reasoning of the Court.

12

MR. STEWART:

So it's part of the

Well, I -- but I think at most

13

the Court in Irwin was not trying to adopt a clear rule

14

across the board; it was trying to adopt a presumption,

15

while recognizing that Congress could provide in

16

individual statutes for a rule different from the one

17

that the presumption would suggest.

18

Congress had already been told that the language it was

19

using would be treated as jurisdictional -- and the

20

Court in the Kendall line of cases had not simply used

21

the label jurisdictional; it had said statutes of

22

limitations governing suits against private parties can

23

be waived if they're not asserted in a timely fashion,

24

but the time limit for filing suit against the United

25

States in the Court of Claims is different.
38
Alderson Reporting Company

And again if -

This is a

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

limit on the Court's authority and the Court is required

2

to notice it whether it's pleaded by the government or

3

not.

4

So I think Congress had been told that it

5

was already using language that would have the effect of

6

causing this to be jurisdictional and nonwaivable.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Did Congress think that

8

Rule 8(c) has no range of application?

And -- we have

9

two recent statements saying statutes of limitations

10

against the government are like statutes against private

11

parties.

12

over which the Court of Federal Claims has

13

jurisdiction -- if, if it's for jurisdictional, then I

14

don't know what cases there would be in which there's a

15

time limit in a suit against the government that isn't

16

jurisdictional.

17

But if 2501, which covers all of the cases

MR. STEWART:

I mean -- I think -- I think

18

you may well be correct, that is perhaps to the extent

19

the drafters of the rule were doing something other than

20

simply incorporating the existing language of the

21

comparable Federal Rule of Civil Procedure.

22

were saying was if there's a statute of limitations out

23

there that would function as an affirmative defense in

24

our cases, in our court, we want it to be pleaded

25

immediately as it would be in a private civil action.
39
Alderson Reporting Company

If all they

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

If that's what they're saying, you may well

2

be right that the class of cases to which that would

3

pertain is the null set or something very close to it.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Doesn't Mr. Haynes have a

5

point when he suggested at the end of his argument that

6

questions about accrual involve much more complicated

7

factual questions than are usually involved in deciding

8

whether a court has jurisdiction?

9

case came up today and the government adhered to its

So imagine if this

10

prior position -- I don't know whether it's still it's

11

position -- that there had not been a permanent taking

12

until 1998, would the court -- and none of the events

13

that happened before 1998 had been brought to the

14

court's attention -- would the court have to say to the

15

parties:

16

fence put up in 1998, but now you have to tell us

17

everything else that's happened on this site going back

18

10 years to see whether there -- whether the claim might

19

have accrued at some earlier point.

20

MR. STEWART:

21

three responses to that.

22

judgment could be entered in favor of the plaintiff, the

23

court would ultimately have to determine not only that

24

there was -- had been a taking, but would have to

25

determine the date on which the taking occurred in order

Well, this is fine; we see that there was a

Well, I guess we'd have two or
The first is, at least before

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to award compensation, if nothing else.

2

like the kind of question that would ultimately have to

3

be determined, at least before the plaintiff could be

4

successful.

5

So this seems

The second thing, as was pointed out before,

6

at least in the majority of cases where there is a

7

viable limitations argument, the government is going to

8

plead it, and so asking the court to look beyond this -

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

But what if you didn't think

10

it was -- it was a good argument.

11

obligation to say, we think there was a permanent fence

12

put up in 1998 and we agree that there was a taking as

13

of that point, but we don't think it happened earlier,

14

but you need to know all of these additional facts?

15

Would you have an obligation to present that to the

16

court?

17

MR. STEWART:

Would you have an

18

court's rules.

20

advocate would include at least a thumbnail sketch of

21

the relevant facts.

22

23

jurisdiction unless he or she was actively contesting

24

it, then no.

25

That is, if the court required a

If it was -- if the rules of the

But the -- I guess the more fundamental
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

point we would make is the speculation as to disruptive

2

results would carry a lot more force if the government

3

were asking for a rule that was different from what had

4

been done in the past.

5

concede that, for the great bulk of the country's

6

history, this rule was treated as jurisdictional, and

7

Petitioner's argument is simply that that line of

8

authority was effectively overruled in Irwin in 1990.

9

And so if in fact treating this limit as a

That is, even Petitioner would

10

jurisdictional limit would have the effect of disrupting

11

litigation in the CFC, we would expect the Petitioner to

12

have actual evidence to that effect.

13

for a different rule than had been enforced in the past,

14

then there would be more -

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If we were asking

But we do know the CFC is

16

at least confused because they have some cases going one

17

way and some cases going the other way.

18

government's point of view, the government can be relied

19

on to raise the statute of limitations, I suppose, but

20

aren't there cases where the government would really

21

like to get the substantive issue settled?

22

well, the statute of limitations is arguable, but we'll

23

concede that the action was timely.

24

MR. STEWART:

25

And from the

So it says,

I think that's true even as to

cases involving barriers that everyone would concede are
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

jurisdictional.

2

a litigant sues us, and there is great doubt as to his

3

standing to sue, and it may be an issue that we think is

4

otherwise framed in an appropriate context, and the

5

government might feel that it would be to everyone's

6

benefit to get the issue resolved when -- one way or the

7

other.

8

jurisdictional barrier is simply that the government

9

can't always have its way.

10

For instance, there are cases in which

But one consequence of treating that as a

So I don't think -- I would think that you

11

are correct that there might be some instances in which

12

treatment of this limit as a jurisdictional bar would

13

not be in the government's interest.

14

basis for holding it to be nonjurisdictional.

15

But that's not a

Certainly the majority of cases involving

16

both -- I think, involving both 2501 and other

17

provisions that impose time limits for suits against the

18

government, in which the courts have held that the

19

relevant limit is jurisdictional, typically the

20

situation arises where the government decides to make an

21

argument on appeal that it didn't make in the district

22

court.

23

government doesn't argue the point even on appeal and

24

the court of appeals nevertheless holds that the suit

25

was untimely, those are the rarity.

I think a case like this one, where the

43
Alderson Reporting Company

But we certainly

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

agree that the logical implication of treating the time

2

limit as jurisdictional is that the Federal circuit did

3

the right thing here.

4

I'd like to say a couple of words about

5

Bowles.

I think Bowles doesn't compel a ruling in the

6

government's favor, but it does support our position in

7

various respects.

8

to earlier, Bowles emphasized that time limits for

9

filing notices of appeal had historically been treated

First, as the Chief Justice alluded

10

as jurisdictional limits, and the Court said that, given

11

the choice between calling into question some dicta in

12

our recent opinions and effectively overruling a century

13

worth of practice, we think the former option is the

14

only prudent course.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But, of course, Bowles -

16

I mean the Court did miss something.

Everyone on the

17

Court did, and that is that the period to file your

18

notice of appeal was originally not in any statute.

19

was in the rule, the FRAP rule.

20

sides, assumed that the statute came first, and the rule

was adopted to conform to the statute, but in fact it

was just the opposite.

the Court, both sides, thought in Bowles -- we just had

7

And then the statute, after the

MR. STEWART:

So what

I agree that the Court's

8

opinions didn't note that fact, but I don't think that

9

fact would or should have affected the treatment of the

10

statute as jurisdictional.

11

to Congress's attention that there was a potential

12

conflict or tension between the language of the

13

jurisdictional statute and the language of the

14

corresponding Federal rule, Congress had the choice to

15

make as to which should govern, and if Congress had

16

wanted a different result from the one that was in the

17

Federal rule, it could have enacted different language.

18

I think it would not -- whatever we might privately

19

think is the level of attention that Congress -

20

That is, once it was brought

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, Congress didn't

21

think about it at all until the U.S. Judicial Conference

22

said do this -

23

MR. STEWART:

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

But -- and the U.S. Judicial

Conference wasn't thinking that thereby it became
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

jurisdictional.

2

MR. STEWART:

But my point is that, once

3

this was brought to Congress's attention, Congress could

4

have chosen to stick with other language, in which case

5

I have no doubt that the corresponding rule would have

6

been amended to fit the statute.

7

level of attention we might privately think that

8

Congress acted as a body, passed a law, it was signed -

Again, whatever

12

statutory rule and had to be treated as such.

13

agree that this aspect of the problem wasn't addressed

14

specifically by the opinions in Bowles, but I don't see

15

any basis -

16

It was signed into law

And from that point forward, it was a

So I

19

rule before -- before there was a conforming statute,

20

you would say, well, then it wasn't jurisdictional,

21

right?

22

It was addressed that the rule -- that

MR. STEWART:

But the

I think to treat it as a

23

conforming statute suggests that, in some way, Congress

24

was obligated to do what the advisors told it to do or

25

was obligated to conform Section 2107(a) to the terms of
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the Federal rule, and that's not the case.

Congress

2

could have -- once this matter was brought to its

3

attention, Congress could have enacted whatever statute

4

it wanted.

5

preexisting language of the rule, but from that time

6

forward, the notice of appeal deadline was grounded in

7

statute, and it was a statutory limit that applied to

8

Bowles's own notice of appeal.

9

is a basis for saying the case would or should have come

It chose to enact a statute that tracked the

So I don't think there

10

out differently if the Court had been aware of the

11

history of the statute's development.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

May I go back to the

13

answer you gave Justice Stevens when he asked you to

14

assume that there was no precedent, we're reading this

15

as an original matter.

16

correct me if I'm wrong, was that, well, in any event

17

"shall be barred" means that it can't be waived anyway.

18

But statute -- I looked up other statutes of

19

limitations, and other statutes of limitations:

20

not be entertained," "may not be commenced," "may not be

21

brought."

22

MR. STEWART:

I thought your answer to him,

"Shall

My point is, if we were

23

reading the statute without reference to any precedent

24

addressing either 2501 itself or statutes of limitations

25

generally, kind of the pure myopic, literal reading of
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the statute, without reference to the legal context,

2

would suggest that "every" means every, "shall be

3

barred" means shall be barred, and there is no exception

4

for cases in which the government fails to raise the

5

argument in a timely way.

6

And my point is -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

My response was all

7

statute of limitations say that and all statute of

8

limitations can be waived.

9

MR. STEWART:

And my point is there is no

10

basis for Petitioner's argument that in inferring

11

Congress's intent the Court should look to part of the

12

broader legal context, namely:

13

and others that have dealt with the general treatment of

14

statutes of limitations, but should ignore the other

15

part of the legal context, namely:

16

Court that have said, squarely and unequivocally, this

17

particular time limit is different.

18

Decisions of this Court

Decisions of this

This particular time limit is nonwaivable

19

and jurisdictional even though most statutes of

limitations can be waived if they are not asserted in a

We

disagreed on parts of the Irwin opinion, but I take it

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY K. HAYNES

17

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

18

MR. HAYNES:

With respect, I suggest that

19

the government won the battle, but lost the war on

20

Irwin.

21

This Court over the last few decades has

22

attempted to bring some coherence to both the questions

23

of sovereign immunity and subject matter jurisdiction.

24
25

And I think that the way the Court has
framed the issues in Irwin to say that there is a
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

presumption that statutes of limitation are tollable

2

and, therefore, are not jurisdictional in our view,

3

tends to show that the Court wants a clear statement

4

from Congress.

5

The presumption language says Congress may

6

at any time say otherwise and make a statute of

7

limitations jurisdictional.

8

statute of limitations would not affect subject matter

9

jurisdiction.

Unless it does so, the

10

My brother makes the argument that Brockamp

11

rebutted the Irwin presumption, but it's very important

12

to understand that the Brockamp decision did not speak

13

in jurisdictional terms.

14

of statutory -- not "a mere matter" -- it spoke in terms

15

of statutory interpretation.

16

jurisdictional terms.

17

It spoke in a -- a mere matter

It did not speak in

So Erwin, standing unassailed since that

18

time, has forced the courts to look at the plain

19

language of the statute, which is precisely what we

20

advocate this Court does.

questions, thank you.
