v. Davis.

Mr. Trower.

ORAL ARGUMENT of C. CHRISTOPHER TROWER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. TROWER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Kentucky's tax exemption for municipal bond

12

interest paid by Kentucky and its political subdivisions

13

to Kentucky taxpayers treats all private entities the

14

same, and favors only Kentucky and its political

15

subdivisions.

16

which favors government, whether the State or local

17

government, rather than private business enterprises

18

violates the dormant Commerce Clause.

19

The Court's decision last term in United Haulers holds

20

that State laws which favor government but which treat

21

all private business entities in State and out of State

22

the same does not discriminate against interstate

23

commerce.

24
25

This Court has never held that a law

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is what you just said true

about conduit bonds, where Kentucky issues bonds to
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

finance private construction?

2

just made accurate?

3

MR. TROWER:

Is the statement that you

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

4

Private activity bonds, a subset of which are conduit

5

bonds, account for approximately 20 percent of all

6

municipal bonds issued.

7

has two point to it.

8
9

And I think your question has,

First of all is whether or not a State or a
municipality ought to be able to use its tax exempt

10

borrowing power to further a project chosen by the

11

municipality to achieve public purposes, such as for

12

example tax exempt hospitals or other facilities that

13

are tax exempt, should it be able to use that tax exempt

14

borrowing power constitutionally?

15

yes.

The answer there is,

Congress has already made that decision.

16

The second question is whether there's a

17

Commerce Clause problem if a State exempts it's own

18

private activity bonds but taxes private activity bonds

19

issued in other States?

20
21

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's what you do, isn't

it?

22

MR. TROWER:

Yes, sir.

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Doesn't that raise, in

24

effect, sort of a distinction between Carbone and United

25

Haulers?

Or at least one way of understanding the
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

distinction between those two cases?

2

facility, in fact, was not the facility of the

3

government.

4

MR. TROWER:

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

In Carbone the

That's correct.
Here the, the immediate

6

beneficiary of the bonds is, in Justice Alito's hypo, is

7

a private entity?

8
9

MR. TROWER:

That's correct, that the

immediate beneficiary of the bonds or of the loan is a,

10

is a nongovernmental entity.

11

private business.

12
13

It's not necessarily a

As we point out in our reply brief, 80
percent of all private activity bonds go for -

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But -- correct me if I'm

15

wrong, just a matter of fact.

16

instances the immediate beneficiary would be a private

17

entity who, in effect, was enabled to borrow at a lower

18

rate?

19

MR. TROWER:

I thought in most

That is correct.

It would be a

20

nongovernmental entity that would be able to borrow at a

21

tax exempt rate.

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So don't you have to

23

take -- therefore, if you're going to answer Justice

24

Alito as you did, don't you have to take the position

25

that Carbone really is not good law and the
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Carbone/United Haulers distinction is not a -- is simply

2

not a relevant distinction?

3
4

As a dissenter in Carbone, I naturally do
not find that the worst answer you could give.

5

(Laughter.)

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

7

But don't you have to give

that answer?

8

MR. TROWER:

I thought the distinction that

9

you drew in your dissenting opinion in Carbone between

10

the one entity that has got to get the job done within

11

the jurisdiction is the key distinction in observing

12

United Haulers.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, as a dissenter in

14

United Haulers, I also don't think it's a good

15

distinction.

16

(Laughter.)

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

But couldn't there be

18

instances where some, an industrial, a company is trying

19

to -- is deciding to locate a plant and is choosing

20

between Kentucky and Ohio, and Kentucky says, come to

21

Kentucky because we'll issue private activity bonds so

22

that you can finance this more cheaply than if you went

23

into Ohio?

24

doing exactly what the dormant Commerce Clause is

25

supposed to prevent?

And when you do that, aren't you, aren't you

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. TROWER:

No.

You're doing -- the

2

dormant Commerce Clause in no way restricts the ability

3

of States to provide economic incentives for in-State

4

business activity.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Trower, were private

6

activity bonds considered at all below?

As far as I

7

understand, this is not a private activity bond, it's

8

not, what's at issue here.

9

adjudication with respect to that type of bond -

And there was no

10

MR. TROWER:

That's exactly -

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

MR. TROWER:

-- in the lower courts.

That is exactly right, ma'am.

13

And our position is that Respondents have no standing to

14

make a claim focused solely on private activity bonds,

15

because there is no evidence in the record as to whether

16

Respondents own any private activity bonds.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Suppose that you -- and I

18

have the same hypothetical for both you and your

19

brothers on the other side with some adjustment here,

20

because I'm finding the case quite difficult.

21

the -- for you, imagine we have some milk producers in

22

Kentucky.

23

legislature and they say, you know, we can sell a lot

24

more milk in Kentucky if you will pass a law imposing a

25

tax on Missouri farmers who want to ship milk into

They are farmers.

And the,

And they go to the

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Kentucky.

That's the classic unlawful -- all right.

2

It's unlawful, unconstitutional, right.

3

MR. TROWER:

Yes, sir.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Now, what is

5

the difference if a city in Kentucky that wants to

6

finance its schools says now to the legislature, we're

7

going to find it easier to sell bonds in Kentucky or

8

elsewhere, in Kentucky, for our school system if you'll

9

only put a tax on similar bonds that Missouri is

10

offering to finance their city schools?

11

just like the milk.

12

That will help,

Now, what's the difference?

MR. TROWER:

The difference is, is twofold.

13

One, the favoritism in the first example, the dairy

14

cases, which have come up a million times, is a

15

favoritism of a private industry, whereas in your second

16

hypothetical the favoritism is to the most public of

17

industries, education.

18

The second difference is that a tax on

19

out-of-State dairy products increases the cost of

20

out-of-State dairy products to in-State consumers with

21

no detriment to in-State dairy producers, whereas, as

22

our Respondents have pointed out in their brief, when a

23

tax is imposed by a government on a transaction where

24

the government itself is paying the money, which is what

25

we have here, a tax on interest income paid by the
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

government, the effect is to impose a dollar-for-dollar

2

reduction in the government's tax revenues equal to the

3

amount of the exemption.

4

entity, namely, the government itself, that is suffering

5

a revenue loss.

6
7

So you've got an in-State

That's not at all comparable to the dairy
hypothetical.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

dairy products that are suffering loss.

10

voters in the States.

We have consumers in the
They're all the

Everyone drinks milk.

11

MR. TROWER:

Yes, sir.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

So they are suffering a

13

dollar-for-dollar loss, because their milk becomes more

14

expensive.

15

I don't know if that's analogous.

16

it's a pretty strong analogy.

17

of course the point that's worrying me.

18

this is a public matter.

19

MR. TROWER:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think

As to the first, that's
It is true that

Yes, sir.
Would it make a difference

21

in the first case if it happened to be some dairy

22

farmers who -- there are so few in Massachusetts now,

23

unfortunately, that they all work on State-owned dairy

24

farms that are put up for, you know -- does it make a

25

difference?
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

MR. TROWER:

I think it would make a

difference.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

MR. TROWER:

It would make a difference?

If a hamburger stand is owned

5

by the State, it's okay under United Haulers.

6

State wants to go into the dairy business, the Commerce

7

Clause doesn't prevent the state from doing that.

8

That's our answer, is that the Commerce Clause does not

9

extend to activities by a State on behalf of all of its

10
11

If the

people.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We have a different

12

variation here that wasn't present in United Haulers,

13

which, of course, is that Kentucky does compete with

14

other public entities in the municipal bond market.

15

other words, I think you have a strong case with respect

16

to discrimination against private bonds, but Kentucky

17

competes against Ohio bonds as well.

18

the Kentucky bonds more attractive through this

19

discriminatory tax on the Ohio bonds.

20
21
22

In

And they're making

Why isn't that a sufficient distinction from
United Haulers?
MR. TROWER:

The key distinction in the

23

United Haulers, Mr. Chief Justice, was between an entity

24

with the responsibility for the welfare of the citizens

25

within the jurisdiction versus all other entities.
10
Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

just happened to be in United Haulers that that was a

2

public entity versus private entities.

3

Haulers, we submit, would have reached exactly the same

4

result if the trash haulers had wanted to take the

5

garbage to a municipal or a public facility in New

6

Jersey, as opposed to a private facility in New Jersey.

7

But United

And the second answer to your question is

8

that other public entities, other States, other

9

municipalities have no responsibilities in Kentucky for

10

the public welfare.

They're no different than private

11

borrowers in Kentucky.

12

immunity in Kentucky if they default on their bonds.

13

They can be sued in Kentucky court.

14

essential difference.

They don't have sovereign

That's the

15

The question I think that the Justice Breyer

16

brought up would also lead me to talk about what are the

17

purposes of the Commerce Clause writ large, or the

18

dormant Commerce Clause not writ large, that have

19

motivated this Court's jurisprudence?

20

three:

21

repeatedly said does not apply to activity by the State

22

on its open behalf; secondly, the free market or free

23

trade rationale, which has motivated many of the Court's

24

decisions, but at the same time the Court has always

25

been careful to say that the free trade rationale, Maine

I think there are

Economic protectionism, which the Court has

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

v. Taylor for example, does not value free trade above

2

all other values that we have.

3

the value here is the fundamental sovereignty of the

4

States.

5

And we would submit that

Our political system subdivides

6

responsibility for government and responsibility for

7

public works in America.

8

States to make a profit or to leverage their return on

9

equity.

Bonds are not issued by the

Bonds aren't issued to create an investment

10

opportunity for Wall Street or for Main Street.

11

are issued to finance the essential work of government.

12

And this Court's decision should look at that part of

13

the equation as much more significant and weigh those

14

values much more heavily than the values of the free

15

market, which don't really apply to the State's

16

provision of goods and services.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Bonds

In all the dairy cases

Suppose a State said that

19

it was unlawful for anyone other than a State resident

20

to purchase the bond?

21
22
23

MR. TROWER:

That would be completely

constitutional.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

What if -- what if the

24

State offered its taxpayers a higher interest rate than

25

purchasers from other States?

Would that be

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

permissible?

2

MR. TROWER:

Yes, sir, that would be totally

3

permissible and would achieve the same result as the

4

exemption that we've got here.

5

before you is -

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

So what you've got

How would that achieve the

7

same result if these bonds weren't negotiable and they'd

8

be hard to sell, hard for you to sell, if people who

9

bought them couldn't sell them, and they could sell them

10

to somebody out of State and get the higher interest

11

rate?

12

MR. TROWER:

I thought the question was if

13

the bonds increased the interest rate and limited the

14

purchasers to Kentucky citizens.

15
16

JUSTICE ALITO:

that Kentucky citizens could not sell to anyone else?

17

MR. TROWER:

else.

MR. TROWER:

State to offer bonds for sale and limit the sale to

25

Kentucky residents and limit the payment of interest to

8

financing of public goods and services.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes, sir.

The

Would it be

Our point is we've got a

Would it be constitutional

10

to say that the holder of the bond must always be a

11

Kentucky resident or, if you sold the bond, it has to be

12

to another Kentucky resident?

13

MR. TROWER:

Yes, it would be.

We've got

14

the same analogy in the securities law, where the

15

intrastate exemption is conditioned upon the holder of

16

the security being an in-State resident who must agree

17

not to transfer the security out of State.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I suppose you

19

could achieve the same result simply by providing you're

20

not going to pay interest to somebody who is not a

21

Kentucky resident.

22

MR. TROWER:

Yes, sir, you could.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So if New York has a very

24

strong financial community, it can really benefit its

25

citizens by keeping the market in New York bonds for

itself, if it chooses?

2

MR. TROWER:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

Yes, it could.
And your case for that is

what, United Haulers?

5

MR. TROWER:

Yes, sir, as well as an

6

attention -- as I was going to earlier, the larger

7

principles that are behind the dormant Commerce Clause

8

jurisprudence of the Court.

9

about economic protectionism.

The Court has -- we talked
We talked about the free

10

trade rationale.

11

comes up often in the Court's opinions is political

12

solidarity.

13

not a grant of power to the national government to enact

14

free trade laws, but rather it was a grant of power to

15

the national government to prevent Union-dividing

16

friction between the States.

17

And then the third rationale which

That is to say that the Commerce Clause was

We don't have that friction here.

All 49

18

States support Kentucky's position.

19

political friction is not an issue, the need for

20

judicial invalidation of the laws of 42 States is

21

commensurately less.

Where that

On the other hand, what are the things that

Well, Bacchus was a case which

favored the in-State pineapple wine producers -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- with a tax.
I've always thought it was

10

incorrectly decided, to be honest with you, but it's

11

there.

12

It's been there a long time.
MR. TROWER:

That doesn't surprise me at

13

all, Justice Stevens, because your concurring opinion in

14

that position.

We agree with

So we have to

No, sir.

The

20

suggestion that we're making here today is that a tax

exemption which applies directly and exclusively to the

payment of money by a government to its direct trading

23

partners is all you're dealing with here.

not change the result in Bacchus, Boston Stock Exchange,

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Does your argument

3

depend upon the uses to which Kentucky is putting these

4

proceeds?

5

MR. TROWER:

No, sir.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I thought it

7

would because you're saying nobody else is responsible

8

for public works in Kentucky and so on.

9

MR. TROWER:

I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.

I thought you meant it made a difference whether they

No.

facility.
Yes, sir.

So, if Kentucky had

16

a law that it could only -- no out-of-State car dealer

17

could sell cars in Kentucky, that benefited Kentucky car

18

dealers, and then it had a special tax on Kentucky car

19

dealers to fund local hospitals, airports, roads,

20

whatever -- that would be all right?

21

MR. TROWER:

22

right.

reverse.

I don't think that would be all

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Three reasons, Justice

6

Breyer.

the purpose of or justification for a law has no bearing

8

on whether it is facially discriminatory.

How is

Justice Breyer, that would be

the New Energy case as the difference between subsidy

10

and a tax.

11

I think here Justice Holmes' admonition that a page of

12

history is worth a volume of logic makes sense.

14

subsidies without representation," it was "no taxation

15

without representation."

wasn't clear in the hypothetical.

The hypothetical was

that you get a thousand-dollar rebate on your income

You pay a lower State tax.

So I was trying to make it exactly like this case.

MR. BRUNSTAD:

you would look through the form to the substance, and

23

the substance there is we will charge you X amount for

Well here, Your Honor, as the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

There is a key

But in that case, the only

thing the State was doing was taxing.

Here the State is not acting

The State has a dual capacity,

and you say ignore one side of that capacity for the

other; and my question is why?

13

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Because, Justice Souter, here

14

what the State is taxing is the out-of-State commodity.

15

It is taxing -- it is doing a downstream regulation.

16

The State issues a commodity -- just like in

owned the timber, and then it imposed a downstream

is manufactured or produced out-of-State.

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

your characterization that this case should be treated

2

exactly as if the State were acting merely in a

3

regulatory capacity?

4

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Because Justice Souter, the

5

entire purpose of the dormant Commerce Clause

6

jurisprudence is to protect the integrity of the market.

7

If Kentucky wants to have a subsidy and say we are going

8

to subsidize our own residents, fine.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That builds up

And the whole purpose of -

11

of the combined effect of market participant for the -

12

acting for the purpose of providing an essentially

13

governmental service is to give the State a free hand.

14

Why do we ignore that in your argument in favor simply

15

of the regulatory side?

16

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Because, Justice Souter, what

17

they are doing here is imposing a facially

18

discriminatory tax.

19

under the Court's precedents, they have no other

20

alternative.

21

They have the burden of saying,

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But the question is whether

22

it will be treated as we treat a facially discriminatory

23

tax when there is no market participation, there is no

24

State participation for the purpose of providing a

25

fundamental governmental service.

If -- if in fact

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there is a good reason to treat them differently, then

2

we don't follow the -- the facial discrimination test.

3

Let me -- let me ask a -- a question with

4

that as the premise.

Assuming -- and I obviously do

5

assume -- that we have a choice of analysis here, one

6

good reason to choose the analysis that your brother

7

has -- that the State is forwarding is the fact that we

8

have historically a bond market which has grown up since

9

New York issued the first tax-exempt or -- a bond.

10

MR. BRUNSTAD:

In 1919, Your Honor.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And we have an enormous

12

market, the effect of interrupting which we really, as a

13

Court, cannot tell very much.

14

very good reason to give the nod to the -- to the market

15

participant, the essential services side of what the

16

State is doing, as opposed to the regulatory side, and

17

simply confront the thing under Pike.

And that seems to me a

18

Why isn't that a good reason?

19

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Because, Justice Souter, this

20

case represents a classic race to the bottom where the

21

only reason why we have these discriminatory tax laws is

22

because New York started it in 1919.

23
24
25

It wanted to hoard its own local investment

Why

aren't their arguments limited to discrimination against

them rather than discrimination against out-of-State

issuers?

MR. BRUNSTAD:

that it wouldn't be limited with the -- the taxpayer in

The remedy, Your Honor, would

be for the State to decide whether it wants to make all

25

Now, in Kentucky there is a constitutional
provision which says they cannot -- they basically
36
Alderson Reporting Company

cannot have their own bonds other than tax-exempt.

2

So unless they change their constitution,

the result would be to make all the bond, municipal

bonds, tax-exempt in Kentucky, which, of course, would

5

benefit my clients, who hold out-of-State municipal

bonds.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But whether or not

it benefits them, it seems to me, depends on how

competitive they are with other States' municipal bonds.

from the tax exemption for Kentucky bonds; and it's not

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. BRUNSTAD:

happen is that bond prices might adjust, but we would

that was given of a interstate compact, say, to operate

a port authority that covers a few States, and the

compacters agree that they are not going to tax the

22

got -

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

24

MR. TROWER:

25

huge as well.

In the insurance industry?

Yes, sir, and that's obviously

I think that's enough.
