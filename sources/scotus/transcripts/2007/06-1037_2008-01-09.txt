ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT D. KLAUSNER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. KLAUSNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Retirement eligibility in Kentucky is based

12

on 20 years of service or age 55.

Age is not the only

13

determinant.

14

White said in McMann v. United Airlines, all retirement

15

plans necessarily make distinctions based on age.

16

Here it is age or service.

And "age" is not a bad word.

As Justice

And the EEOC's

17

focus on age alone fails to appreciate that Kentucky is

18

an integrated, consolidated retirement plan with the

19

goal of providing benefits to all qualified workers.

20

say, as the EEOC does, that all younger workers will

21

always fare better than all older workers is factually

22

wrong, and it fails to appreciate the myriad factors

23

that go into determining pension amounts.

24
25

It's not age alone that determines the
result.

Age is a factor.

It's not the factor.

2

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

I guess the part that they

4

are saying is arbitrary as I understand it, and I

5

appreciate your correcting me if I don't understand it

6

correctly, is that you get double your pension at 55 if

7

you've worked 20 years as opposed to 10.

8

MR. KLAUSNER:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is that right?

No, Mr. Chief Justice A worker who has been

13

started at 45, he ended up at 55, he gets "X".

14

started at 35 and worked for 20 years, he would get much

15

more than "X".

16

MR. KLAUSNER:

There is a chart in the SG's

If he

17

correct, that would be true, Your Honor, limited only to

20

more imputed service.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

The person who began

You would get "Y", because

22

he worked for 20 years rather than 10; is that right?

23

MR. KLAUSNER:

5

In a normal requirement

JUSTICE BREYER:

So if a person works for 20

6

years, he gets more than if he worked for 10 years; is

7

that right?

8

MR. KLAUSNER:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's right.
Now he is disabled.

And

10

when he's disabled, if he's disabled after working only

11

10 and he is 45 years old, they pretend he had worked

12

the full 20?

MR. KLAUSNER:

They impute -- yes, Your

They impute the additional service to you.

JUSTICE BREYER:

me six years extra.

The difference is that the

imputed service comes before 55, because you're not

You're giving me reasons.

Correct.
Okay.

Now I'll say that I

think is the discrimination of which he is complaining.

20

reason is there for that difference?

21

hear what the reason is that justifies that difference.

22

Now I'd like to

You give him six extra years when he retired

23

after 14 years and though he was only 49 years old, and

24

you don't give him even one extra year when everything

25

else was the same but he retired after he was 55.

MR. KLAUSNER:

The reason for that, Justice

Breyer, is as follows:

to replicate as closely as possible within some

percent as well.

Good, I'm glad you do

Give me the six extra years at two and-a-half
Treat us alike.

4

What's your response?

5

MR. KLAUSNER:

My response, Justice, is

6

this.

They start out un-alike.

As I mentioned before,

7

the person who was in 55 in your example, A, is already

8

eligible for benefit.

9

disabled.

He doesn't have to wait to be

He may leave tomorrow.

10

The person who starts younger, particularly

11

in a public safety retirement plan, spends more time in

12

the line of fire than the person who starts older.

13

person who starts older takes advantage of the fact that

14

in this retirement plan you can retire with as little as

15

five years of service.

16

eligible for a benefit after only a month.

17

Kentucky may be the only plan in the country that does

18

that.

19

The

Actually a person who is 55 is
In fact,

But where they don't start out alike and

20

where the EEOC's chart is based on fallacy is that the

21

22

always closer to retirement, they needed less years.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

This has been very

3

helpful, but it does seem to me to raise a question

4

about the fairness of your opening statement.

5

by saying something to the effect that this does not

discriminate on the basis of age.

7

explicit factor that the statute uses in order to answer

It does.

You began

Age is the

applies, but it does -- the Act goes on to prohibit the

11

use of age in some of the circumstances.

12

those circumstances is the hypothetical of the

13

55-plus-year-old person used in Justice Breyer's

14

statement and example.

15

And one of

So, it is not correct, it seems to me, for

16

you to say that this does not discriminate on the basis

17

of age.

18

that, you can get into that, but it seems to me it does

19

make an explicit determination based on age as to some

20

people.

21

Now, maybe there is some good reasons for doing

reason.

age plus service.

15
16

Right.

MR. KLAUSNER:

Right.

Yes, Mr. Chief

Justice.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

But your answer, as I

18

understand it, to Justice Breyer's question was, could

19

be boiled down to this:

20

benefit or total benefit following disability is

21

calculated on the basis of age 55, is less likely to

22

have worked or is likely to have worked less long than

23

the person whose benefit is imputed and calculated on

24

the basis of 20 years.

25

we'll say the person in the 55-year-old category has

The person whose disability

And because the odds are that

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

worked less and endured less risk, it is, therefore,

2

fair to impute less time on average to such a person,

3

and therefore, give a lower benefit.

4

You're saying there is a tradeoff.

And the

5

tradeoff is because the 55-year-old retiree may get a

6

benefit after very little work and very little risk, it

7

is therefore fair and not a discrimination that on the

8

average the windfall is less for that person by the

9

imputation than the windfall to the person who retires

10

on the basis of age 20.

11

Is that a fair statement of your argument?

12

MR. KLAUSNER:

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

14

MR. KLAUSNER:

15

Yes.
Okay.
As I noted before, it's

about retirement eligibility, not about age.

16

In Hazen Paper you dealt with the question

17

of an individual who was fired because they were about

18

to meet the 10-year vesting requirement in a private

19

sector plan.

20

The Court found that it wasn't an age discrimination

21

case because it said that age was merely correlated with

22

what the Court called pension status.

23

status and retirement eligibility, which can occur at 20

24

years or it can occur at age 55 with some service, is

25

exactly the same.

The person was also over the age of 40.

In 11
Alderson Reporting Company

I think pension

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE ALITO:

That would be a good

2

argument if the sole basis for retirement under your

3

system was years of service, but it's not just years of

4

service, isn't that right?

5

MR. KLAUSNER:

That's correct, Justice.

One

6

needs some service, but one may retire at 55 or one may

7

retire at 20 years.

8
9
10
11

JUSTICE ALITO:

You can't take your -- you

couldn't take your statute and erase all the references
to age and have the statute work, could you?
MR. KLAUSNER:

No.

And I don't -- I don't

12

think that pension statutes are required to eliminate

13

any use of age at all.

14
15
16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Because the ADA expressly

allows them to do that; isn't that right?
MR. KLAUSNER:

The ADA is designed to

17

eliminate arbitrary age discrimination.

18

the design of the plan is motivated by a policy of the

19

employer to discriminate, to provide less solely because

20

of the individual's age.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That is where

That's -- you're sticking

22

in a word, "arbitrary," that appears nowhere in the body

23

of the statute.

24

that's -- and you're interpreting the statute with that.

25

And it isn't customary for this Court to take words that

You picked it up from the preamble, and

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

don't appear in the text of the statute and read them

2

in, based on some statement of purpose or preamble.

3

MR. KLAUSNER:

Justice Ginsburg, I'm aware

4

that the preamble alone doesn't direct, and I understand

5

that the operative language is in 623(a).

6

that the -

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But I think

You'd be in better shape if

8

it was in legislative history and not in the preamble.

9

We probably would take it into account.

10

MR. KLAUSNER:

I think, Justice, the

11

legislative history is important for this reason.

12

Title VII was first written age was included and then it

13

was taken out, and there was a reason why it was taken

14

out:

15

the basis of race, there is never a reason to

16

discriminate on the basis of national origin or

17

religion; but in government retirement plans, which are

18

paid for life and in which the calculation is determined

19

in part on age, on how long someone will live and how

20

long they've worked and that interrelationship, I think

21

Congress recognized age is qualitatively different.

22

When

Because there is never a reason to discriminate on

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think the Congress

23

recognized that what they were protecting was not age as

24

such, but old age, where in the other case they say it's

25

the racial criterion and whether it's -- or the sex
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

criterion, whether it's a man that's adversely affected

2

or a woman it doesn't make any difference; Title VII

3

applies to them both.

4

doesn't apply to younger workers.

5

you can't discriminate on the basis of age, so you can't

6

prefer the older person over the younger person.

7

But the Age Discrimination Act

MR. KLAUSNER:

It doesn't say that

Justice Ginsburg, I

8

understand this Court's holding in Cline was that the

9

statute is intended to protect the relatively older as

10

it relates to the relatively younger.

11

in Cline that age is qualitatively different, because

12

what gives age reason in terms of discrimination is when

13

it's arbitrary.

14

that's the distinction between the Title VII cases that

15

the Government relies on, and why I think Hazen Paper is

16

important, because, as the Court said, unless you can

17

show in a disparate treatment case that the policy is

18

motivated by age, then I think that the -- the intent

19

goes.

20

Kentucky statute -- and that's what this is; this was a

21

challenge that said the statute discriminates on its

22

face -- that the only inference that one can have is

23

that the design of the plan is motivated to pay older

24

people less.

25

But you also said

That is, when it is invidious, and

And the -- one cannot draw from the face of the

Am I correct in

understanding that your plan does not provide a

disability benefit just as a disability benefit?

22

only time disability is relevant is when it determines

whether or not a person will become eligible for the

hazardous occupation, it will begin immediately, right?

12

You don't wait until you get -- you're 55 to get it.

MR. KLAUSNER:

No, ma'am.

That's the

14

purpose of the imputed services.

15

essentially -- we say if during this gap of time before

16

normal retirement, this risk that's covered, that if

17

this disabling event occurs, we advance you to normal

18

retirement immediately and try to replicate as closely

21

But that's the point,

right?

23

MR. KLAUSNER:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

you give him credit for years he hasn't worked.

6

disabled says:

7

give me any extra years.

What you do when the person is

Now,

Fine, you let me retire, but you don't

Now that's the complaint, I think.

So that

if you had a person who had started at 45, eligible to

10

retire at 55, works for 4 years and becomes disabled, he

11

is credited with 14 years; while the person who started

12

at 35 and at 45 becomes disabled, he is given 20 years.

13

He is given the 10 extra years.

14

older person, says:

15

didn't have to give him those extra years in order to

16

qualify him to retire.

17

retire, but you gave him 10 extra years and you give me

18

no extra years.

19

So the first person,

You gave him some extra years; you

Justice Breyer, is the person who has either 20 years or

21

is 55 on the day they become disabled is already

22

eligible to retire.

of which there were several hundred thousand, you'd have

Actually, the Commonwealth, in response to the liability

to reach the result?

12

MR. KLAUSNER:

Is there another
I think this does

But

Is there some other way

I think Your Honor you can

13

reach the result in this way.

The statute was

14

challenged as being facially discriminatory, and I think

15

under this Court's precedents for facial discrimination,

16

one would have to say that the only reasonable inference

17

in the statute, by its mere use of age, is that you say

18

that it starts out presumptively discriminatory.

19

the Government has really argued here is an as-applied

20

circumstance.

21

certain cases, and in those circumstances the statute

22

would stand on its face and if there is a circumstance

23

in which someone effectively is discriminated, then you

24

look to see are there reasonable factors other than age

25

that effect -- that take effect in this instance?

What

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Secondly, I think the Court can determine -

2

and I think this is the question that is the next step

3

after Hazen, where you said that age correlated with

4

pension status, in that case being vested for 10 years.

5

The question is, if a plan has eligibility to retire as

6

its motivation, that is, it is service regardless of age

7

or age plus service, is it really motivated by age?

8

I think the answer to that question, Justice Kennedy,

9

clearly is no.

10

And

The one thing I would add is if you look at

11

the statute in Betts, the Ohio case, which is the last

12

time an age case on a public plan got to this Court, in

13

the Ohio plan you couldn't get a disability because you

14

were 60, but you could also retire in that plan just

15

like Kentucky on years of service alone, but a

16

years-of-service retiree in Ohio could get a disability.

17

That's not true in Kentucky.

Somebody who

18

starts as a firefighter at 18 no longer has disability

19

protection at 38 years old.

20

police officer at 45 retains disability coverage until

21

they're 55.

22

statute alone enables you to get there.

23

A person who starts as a

MR. STEWART:

It does in the sense that,

with respect to disabled employees, two employees who

have the same total years of actual service but who are

9

of different ages may receive dramatically different

10

benefits.

11
12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That's because of the

period necessary to qualify for retirement?

13

MR. STEWART:

It's -- let me direct your

14

attention to the relevant provision of the Kentucky

15

statute, and it's at page 7a and 8a of the blue brief.

16

This is with respect to -- it's true that, for a normal

retirement, an individual either has to be age 55 with 5

years of service or have 20 years of service at whatever

MR. STEWART:

decision about -- they can require the attainment of a

minimum age as a condition of eligibility for normal or

service.

We don't say that that disables you from the

Age, years of service, and disability.
MR. STEWART:

You can't.

The first thing I

10

would say about that exception is it refers specifically

11

to a minimum age, and what that was intended to make

12

clear was that to the extent that Kentucky allows

13

55-year-olds to retire with only 5 years of service, but

14

requires a 45-year-old to have 20 years of service, that

15

minimum age would not violate the statute.

16

result of this Court's decision in Cline, that provision

17

in a sense is superfluous because the younger worker

18

wouldn't have an ADEA claim anyway.

19

to a minimum age is intended to address that situation.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

Now, as a

But the reference

And It seems to me that what

22

Kentucky is trying to do is to, at least in part,

23

provide make-whole benefits for a police officer who

24

becomes disabled below the age of 55.

25

to do is to say we want to give you the benefit that you
26
Alderson Reporting Company

So what they want

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would have received if you had not been hurt on the job

2

and therefore unable to work and had been able to work

3

to the normal retirement age.

4

Now, if that's correct, is that an

5

illegitimate objective?

6

objective, is there any way that they can do that

7

consistent with your understanding of the ADEA?

8

when someone is over the retirement age, it's rather

9

hard to see how many years you would add on projecting

10

how long that person would continue to work beyond the

11

age of retirement eligibility.

12

MR. STEWART:

And if it's not an illegitimate

Because

It is certainly not

13

illegitimate for Kentucky to say:

14

generous to people who are forced to retire due to

15

disability than to people who choose to retire

16

voluntarily when they are physically capable of

17

continuing to work.

18

We want to be more

And so if Kentucky wants to say, in the case

19

of an individual who is forced to retire due to

20

disability, we will add additional years in computing

21

benefits to estimate the number of years this person

22

would have worked had he or she not become disabled,

23

that's fine as well.

24

What they can't do, at least what they can't

25

do without establishing one of the affirmative defenses,
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is use age as a proxy, as the basis for deciding how

2

many years would this person have worked if he or she

3

had not become disabled because -

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

So if they want to do that

5

and they have a case of a police officer who works

6

beyond 55 -- the officer is 55-plus with 10 years of

7

service and then becomes disabled -- you say they have

8

to give that person 10 years of credit.

9

MR. STEWART:

If they are going to give the

10

45-year-old with 10 years of service 10 years of credit,

11

they have to give the 55-year-old 10 years of service -

12

with 10 years of service 10 years of credit, again,

13

unless they can establish the cost-justification

14

defense.

15

And part of the argument they are making is

16

it would be unduly expensive to guarantee the

17

55-year-old an additional 10 years of service, because

18

it's much more likely that the 55-year-old will become

19

disabled than it is with the 45-year-old.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But he is saying one thing

21

more.

He is saying it's also highly unlikely that the

22

55-year-old has worked as long subject to risk at the

23

point at which the calculation is made than is the case

24

with the person who retires on the basis of 20 years.

25

And so that there is a tradeoff.

And, therefore, you

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

constantly analyze this as the kind of garden variety of

2

discrimination based on age which Congress was aiming

3

for.

4

MR. STEWART:

Well, to go back to the

5

question you were asking Mr. Klausner, I think if we

6

were looking at the class of voluntary retirees, it

7

would be an accurate generalization to say that those

8

above 55 were likely to have fewer years of service than

9

the younger people.

Because the only way that a younger

10

person could qualify for normal retirement would be to

11

amass 20 years of service; whereas, the older person

12

could do it with fewer years.

13

But if you are looking at people who want to

14

continue working but who are prevented from doing so by

15

reason of disability, there is no reason to assume that

16

the older people are going to have spent less time in

17

the line of fire than the younger people.

18

event, the comparison that we are making -

And, in any

Just say that again.

Just

I didn't follow you.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes.

I didn't get it

either.
MR. STEWART:

If we're looking at the class

24

of people who -- including over 55-year-old and under

25

55-year-old -- who want to continue working but who have
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

been prevented from doing so by reason of disability,

2

there is no reason to think that the older people within

3

that class, as a group, will have fewer years in the

4

line of fire than the younger people.

5

--

6
7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I -- I think -- you

mean in the future?

8
9

Why?

And, in any event

MR. STEWART:

No.

No.

Under their belt.

Under their belt.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Under their belt.

I see.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

They are exactly the same

12

people.

13

class, those who voluntarily do and those who are

14

disabled, is happenstance; and the happenstance is

15

disability in the line of service.

16

The only thing that distinguishes the one

MR. STEWART:

It's not just happenstance,

17

because if you're guessing the likely tenure of service

18

of people who take voluntary normal retirement before

19

age 55, in a sense you are skewing the class, because

20

the only people who can do that under Kentucky law are

21

people with at least 20 years of service.

22

So the voluntary retirees, the younger

23

people, as a group, are likely to be -- have longer

24

tenure.

25

respect to people who are forced to retire due to

But that generalization doesn't hold true with

30
Alderson Reporting Company

disability.

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It seems to me your

3

argument boils down to the claim that people who have

4

already reached -- become eligible for retirement by

5

either age or period of service, the State has a duty to

6

give them a chance to recover a disability benefit if

7

they give a disability benefit to younger workers.

8
9
10

MR. STEWART:

No.

Our point is that they

should use the same computation methodology for both
categories of employees.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The computation is for a

12

different purpose in that -- in -- for the younger

13

workers the purpose is to make them eligible for

14

retirement.

15

eligible for retirement.

16

MR. STEWART:

For the older workers, they are already

I think that's incorrect, and

17

that was really the point I was making by quoting from

18

the Kentucky law on page 7a and 8a.

19

provision that I quoted was the provision that

20

establishes eligibility for disability retirement.

21

it says, as the criterion for eligibility, beyond, of

22

course, the fact of disability, the person shall have 60

23

months of service.

24
25

The Kentucky

And

So an individual under Kentucky law who is
forced to retire due to disability and has at least five
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

years of service is eligible for disability retirement.

2

The imputation of additional years of service is not

3

necessary -

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The term "eligibility for

5

retirement," as used in that part of the statute, is

6

referring to actually the same thing as retirement

7

achieved by getting their -- getting credit for

8

post-disability years.

9

MR. STEWART:

Exactly.

Well, the purpose of

10

defining the category of eligible persons is to make

11

sure that they do get a retirement benefit even though

12

they wouldn't satisfy the normal age and service

13

requirements for ordinary retirement.

14

problem with that.

15

And we have no

Kentucky can say we want to define a

16

separate category of individuals who don't satisfy

17

normal age and service rules but who should,

18

nevertheless, be given a retirement benefit because they

19

have been forced to retire due to disability.

20

fine.

21

That's

And if they use the same computation

22

methodology, namely, some factor of actual years of

23

service times final compensation times a multiplier, as

24

they do for normal retirement, that would be fine.

25

-32
Alderson Reporting Company

Our

Official - Subject to Final Review

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it's fine for

2

them to use that, but you're saying it's not fine for

3

them to use any element of age in making that

4

computation?

5

MR. STEWART:

That's correct.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Even though, under

7

the Federal law, they can use age as the exclusive

8

requirement in determining retirement?

9

MR. STEWART:

Well, again, there is a an

10

explicit exemption in the ADEA for a minimum retirement

11

age.

12

from this Court's decision in Cline, it wouldn't have

13

violated the ADEA to say an individual who is 55 with

14

five years of service can get retirement, even though a

15

younger -

And so it wouldn't have violated -- even apart

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

What is wrong with using

17

that as a benchmark?

If you can fire a person when he

18

is 55, why can't you use it as a benchmark as to how

19

much you're going to give a disability person on

20

pension?

21

MR. STEWART:

Well, again, I think the -

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

The lesser or greater -

23

this would be an instance where greater includes lesser

24

for the reason that this lesser business has no

25

stereotypes.

All they're trying to do is to help people
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

who are disabled at a time when they are younger and

2

probably have fairly good expenses, and everybody gets

3

this kind of insurance.

4

And this man who is the Plaintiff here had

5

it, too, while he was there.

6

really using in a minimal sense age, but you are doing

7

it in a statute that permits you to do it because it's a

8

lesser version of that.

9

MR. STEWART:

So it's true you are

There are a couple of things

10

I'd say.

11

saying that a State may establish a minimum -- may

12

establish a retirement age with respect to its State

13

police and firefighters, but it doesn't say the ADEA is

14

inapplicable to police and firefighters who are over age

15

55.

16

The first is that the Act is quite specific in

JUSTICE BREYER:

It doesn't say it's

17

inapplicable.

I wasn't saying it's inapplicable.

18

I am worried about -- and this is a perfect example of

19

people using absolutely mechanical rules, and

20

particularly when you talk about pension systems, which,

21

of course, age is relevant to a pension system, and what

22

they do is find comparisons; and, before you know it,

23

you are in the kind of a -- of a hamburger situation

24

where it's so chopped up that perfectly worthwhile

25

things are forbidden.

And this would seem to be a
34

Alderson Reporting Company

What

Official - Subject to Final Review

number 1 exhibit.

2

MR. STEWART:

There are several different

3

answers I would give.

4

included the lesser, it would be permissible for

5

Kentucky to say:

6

people on the work force, but we'll pay them less

7

because of their age.

8
9

The first is if the greater

We will keep the over 55-year-old

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, because what you are

looking at is to see whether the purpose of Congress is

10

somehow implicated, a purpose designed to prevent

11

stereotypical thinking from being used to put older

12

people at a disadvantage.

13

that this is so in this case.

And there is no indication

14

MR. STEWART:

I think -

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MR. STEWART:

Now, what's the response?

I think that's incorrect, that

17

is, the two justifications that have been given for the

18

disparate treatment of older workers are, first, younger

19

workers as a group are likely to need more of a boost;

20

and, second, the younger disabled person probably would

21

have worked longer if he had not become disabled.

22

so this replicates the situation that would have

23

prevailed.

And

24

I think, whether or not you want to think of

25

those as stigmatizing stereotypes, it's quite clear that
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

neither of those generalizations could typically be used

2

as a basis for age-based disparities.

3

For instance, nobody would claim that an

4

employer could pay the older workers less because they

5

are likely to be less in need of financial assistance.

6

And with respect to the initial -

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The reason for that is that

8

we accept the criterion at the outset that your pay

9

bears some relationship to what you do.

10

We are now in a situation in which the

11

benefit does not bear a relationship to what you are

12

doing or going to do.

MR. STEWART:

Well, on the whole, the

14

benefit bears a close -- the retirement benefit bears a

15

close relationship to what you have done.

16

benefit is calculated on the basis of actual years of

17

service, and the purpose clearly is, in part, to reward

18

the employee for service to the employer.

19

That is, the

But with respect to -- and that's the way

20

it's done with respect to the older disabled worker.

21

His benefits are computed based on what years of service

22

he has actually contributed to the employer.

23

respect to the younger people, it's not based on that

24

alone.

25

With

Rather, the State imputes additional years JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And with respect to that,

36
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Mr. Stewart, the problem that Justice Breyer brought up,

2

you -- if you would look to your brief, page 30,

3

footnote 13, the question is, so we have this -- if we

4

take your interpretation of the statute, how can we deal

5

with a person in her 30s who becomes disabled when she

6

is making a low salary and has only, say, 10 years of

7

service?

8

And you say that's one thing that's all right.

9

She is going to get a very low disability.

On a prospective basis, what could Kentucky

10

do?

11

years of service, which Mr. Klausner said is what is

12

happening, and therefore, these people are getting a lot

13

less than they used to get.

14

there's another way, and that is to impute additional

15

years of service on an age-neutral basis.

16

not specific about what would the age-neutral basis be.

17

One is give the younger workers only their actual

MR. STEWART:

And then you say, oh, but

And you're

I guess there could be a range

18

of alternatives.

19

be for every disabled worker of whatever age impute an

20

additional five years of service as something of a rough

21

estimate of the number that person might have worked if

22

he or she had not become disabled.

23

One alternative, for instance, would

Another possibility would be to impute years

24

of service up to 10 or 20.

Again, there would be

25

probably an infinite number of ways it could be done as
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

long as age were not used as, as the basis.

2

The other thing I wanted to say about -

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

But if do you that, aren't

4

you going to be -- you're going to be undercompensating

5

the younger person who gets disabled and

6

overcompensating the people over 55 who gets disabled

7

who may not -- it may not be realistic to think that

8

someone's going to continue to work as a police officer

9

until 65.

10

I don't know.
MR. STEWART:

Well, the other thing I would

11

say about that justification, which rests on I think the

12

valid statistical correlation between how old you are at

13

the time that you're disabled and how much longer you

14

would have worked.

15

wouldn't think of that as an invidious stereotype.

16

again, it's not a generalization that could typically be

17

used as a basis for age-specific decisions.

18

Again, whether or not -- I think you
But

For example, the Wirtz report makes clear

19

that the paradigmatic pre-ADA practice that Congress

20

wanted to get rid of was a limit of age 50 or age 45 and

21

an employer saying:

22

is over that age.

23

justifiably as a group people above that age are likely

24

to have fewer work years ahead of them than people below

25

that age.

We're not going to hire anybody who
And certainly the employer could say

And if that generalization could provide a
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

basis for an explicit age-based distinction, the Act

2

would really be eviscerated.

3

The other thing I wanted to respond to is

4

the suggestion that, while we might be able to tease

5

this out of the literal language of the statute, this is

6

certainly an unintended consequence.

7

something that Congress would have wanted.

8

the contrary, this is not identical but very similar to

9

the type of disparity that was present in Betts.

It is not
I think, to

That

10

is, in Betts the individual was over the age of normal

11

retirement but had elected to keep working.

15

again, the reason for her retirement was disability.

16

She was told that she couldn't do it.

retirement benefits was significantly more generous than

19

the one that it offered for -

What about this idea, which

is -- would this wreck the statute?

You say we're

talking about age, which is not an immutable

characteristic.

the word "discriminate" and the word "discriminate" in

Everybody goes through it.

Everybody

And therefore we take

39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this context, when considered in terms of pension

2

requirements, which inevitably are age mixed to a

3

considerable degree, means that if there are plausible

4

justifications and no significant reason for thinking

5

that it reflects stereotypical thinking, that it does

6

not fall within the scope of the word "discriminate."

7

MR. STEWART:

I think, first, that would be

8

contrary to the way that the word "discriminate" has

9

been construed in Title VII.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

I started out by saying,

11

that's why I said that this is not an immutable

12

characteristic, and it is -- that's why I put all the

13

qualifications in there.

14

MR. STEWART:

Well, the court in Thurston

15

has said the language of the ADEA should be construed

16

similarly to that of Title VII because the basic

17

anti-discrimination prohibition was drawn in haec verba

18

from Title VII in the legislative history to the older

19

workers's Benefit Protection Act when Congress amended

20

the statute to cover fringe benefits, which the Court in

21

Betts had held were not covered.

22

enacting a new 29 U.S.C. 630(l) to say the term -- that

23

the phrase "terms and conditions of employment" includes

24

fringe benefits.

25

Congress did that by

And the legislative history explains that
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Congress could have achieved the same result by adding a

2

reference to fringe benefits in the basic

3

anti-discrimination provision contained in 29 U.S.C.

4

623(a), but the Congress chose not to do that because it

5

wanted to maintain the similarity in wording between the

6

ADEA's anti-discrimination provision and that of Title

7

VII in order to reinforce the inference that the two

8

were to be construed in pari materia.

9

The other thing I would say with respect to

10

your reference to age distinctions that are not based on

11

stereotypes is again to return to what I was discussing

12

earlier.

13

are first, younger people are likely to have fewer

14

financial resources, so they need more of a boost; the

15

second is the younger worker probably would have worked

16

longer if he hadn't become disabled and therefore this

17

is replicating the situation that would have prevailed

18

absent the disability.

19

The two justifications that have been offered

And again, my point is, whether or not you

20

think of those as invidious stereotypes, they are

21

plainly not generalizations that could typically be used

22

to justify -

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask this question

24

right on that point.

Supposing you have two different

25

people retire, one -- that become disabled, rather 41
Alderson Reporting Company

one because he's five years short of the age eligibility

2

and the other because he's five years short of years of

service, so it would be a younger person, and both would

4

have become eligible for retirement in five years after

5

their disability.

MR. STEWART:

me whether they're treated the same way under the plan.

11
12

And if they are, where is the discrimination?
MR. STEWART:

9
10

Are they treated the same way under

What other variables?

As to the person who is five

years away from qualifying by reason of -

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

17

MR. STEWART:

-- years of service, if that

18

person is younger than 50, then they'll be treated the

19

same, because each of them will have -

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

21

MR. STEWART:

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That's a hypothesis.

But So then how is that

23

discrimination on the basis of age?

24

MR. STEWART:

25

But it is a discrimination on

the basis 42
Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It's not even

discrimination as far as I see it.

3

MR. STEWART:

Well, it wouldn't -- there

wouldn't be any claim of disparate treatment with

5

respect to those two individuals.

6

individual who is 55 years old with 15 years of service

7

and 50 years old with 15 years of service, they are both

8

equally close to the 20-year threshold for qualifying

9

for normal retirement on the basis of years of service.

10

Yet the 50-year-old gets 5 imputed years added and gets

11

a significantly larger benefit than the 55-year-old.

12

But if you have an

Their justification is, well, the

13

55-year-old is already eligible for normal retirement

14

and therefore, it's fair to treat him differently.

15

the point I was making with reference to the Kentucky

16

code is the 50-year-old who is forced to retire due to

17

disability is also eligible for retirement.

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And

It's called

It seems to me that your

20

claim boils down to an argument that the statute

21

requires someone who is already qualified for retirement

22

to get a disability benefit that the younger person

23

would.

24
25

It seems to me that's the basic difference.
MR. STEWART:

correct.

No, I don't think that's

at least five years of service and are forced to retire

3

due to disability and we are excluding people who are

purpose of excluding the older workers is to make clear

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You prevent the

23

State from taking into account the fact that younger

24

disabled workers have not had the same opportunity that

25

older disabled workers have.

And it results -- if we

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

adopt your system where you can look only at years of

2

service, what it, in effect, is going to do is to

3

prevent Kentucky from giving disability benefits to

4

older workers who become disabled.

5

For example, if you have two workers, one

6

who starts work at 18 and acquires years of service,

7

say, 12 years of service and becomes disabled, you would

8

say, well, you can take those years of service into

9

account.

The older worker who begins at age 30 and is

10

disabled in his first year on the job, you say, well,

11

you can only look at years of service.

13

14

the 18-year-old who becomes disabled.

15

MR. STEWART:

You can't impute

So the 30-year-old who

Well, first, we are not

16

preventing Kentucky from imputing additional years.

17

are simply saying the method of determining how many

18

years will be imputed, absent an affirmative defense,

19

can't be dependent on the employee's age.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

We

Would it be the same as -

21

I mean it seems to me now -- I'm thinking the problem is

22

we are going into the package; we are starting opening

23

up the package that the 55-year-old retiree normally

24

gets.

25

Suppose they said this:

do to the disabled person.

Why not?

MR. STEWART:

I'm not quite sure if I

understand the question, but I don't think that there is

any -

14
15

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's fair, that you don't

understand.

16

(Laughter.)

17

MR. STEWART:

I don't think there would be

18

anything wrong with Kentucky saying we are going -- in

19

fact, this is what we are asking for.

20

to say a younger person who is forced to retire due to

21

disability will be treated as though he were 55 years

22

old, that's fine.

23

and they calculate the benefits using actual years of

24

service as they do for the other -- for the older

25

employees, that there is no ADEA problem with that.

If Kentucky wants

If they give him disability benefits

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Our problem is that they say we are treating

2

him as though he had worked additional years until he

3

was 55 when he hasn't, and when the older employee isn't

4

given that same opportunity.

5

And, again, it is true that Kentucky's

6

system is particularly generous to older employees who

7

want to retire voluntarily.

8

little as five years of service, even though the younger

9

worker would have to have more.

They can retire with as

But the people on

10

whose behalf the EEOC is suing have not derived any of

11

that benefit.

These were people who did not retire

12

voluntarily.

They were people who were eligible for

13

retirement benefits, but chose to remain in the work

14

force.

15

estimating how many more years you would have worked, we

16

are going to have an irrebuttable presumption that the

17

answer is zero, even though their very circumstances,

18

the fact that they continued to work after they could

19

have retired, belie that assumption.

20

And, essentially, they are being told, in

And just a final point I wanted to make

21

about Betts, is that the system here is not identical,

22

but very similar to the system that was at issue there,

23

in the sense that an older worker who was forced to

24

retire due to disability got a lower benefit than she

25

would have received if she had been younger with the
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

same years of service and the same disability.

2

It couldn't be clearer that Congress wanted

3

to overturn that decision.

4

enactment of the OWBPA.

5

That was the impetus for the

So I think there is really -- it's not

6

correct to suggest that, even if we win, this is somehow

7

an unintended consequence of what Congress did.

8

the very situation that Congress wanted to cover while

9

providing an affirmative defense to employers who can

This is

satisfy it.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Stewart, before you

12

finish, that little piece that seems to be favoring the

13

younger worker that you guaranteed at least -- what was

14

it, 25 percent of your final monthly salary, and you get

15

10 percent for each child -- now that does seem to be

16

something that's -- that's not available for a regular

17

retiree.

18

MR. STEWART:

It's not available for a

19

regular retiree, and it's not available for a person who

20

is eligible for normal retirement but becomes disabled

21

and is forced to retire for that reason.

22

If the only problem were that Kentucky made

23

those benefits available to people who were forced to

24

retire due to disability, that wouldn't be an ADEA

25

violation, so long as they made those benefits available
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to the older worker who was also forced to retire.

2

But I take your point that those aspects of

3

the statute introduce a further element of age

4

discrimination without even the justification that

5

Kentucky has proffered for the imputed years.

6

With respect to the children, in particular,

7

that seems to be the only other area in the plan in

8

which Kentucky is directly targeting the people who are

9

in greatest financial need, at least by one measure

10

having dependent children, and yet the older workers are

11

left out of that entirely.

Eligibility for retirement is the motivation.

Age isn't the driver.

And while my brother says that Congress

eligibility is being used to force people not to get

some other benefit in some other stand-alone plan.
