ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

9

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PETITIONER

10
11
12

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Congress enacted the Federal Credit Union Act to

13

foster the development of strong and stable, cooperative

14

credit institutions so that persons not being served by

15

banks could obtain credit at non-usurious rates.

16

union proponents advocated including the common bond

17

provision because experience had shown that credit unions

18

organized around preexisting, cohesive groups were most

19

likely to form economically strong cooperative

20

institutions.

21

Credit

The banks lack standing under the APA to

22

challenge the NCUA's interpretation of the common bond

23

provision because Congress enacted that provision as an

24

organizing principle to promote financially viable credit

25

unions and not to impose substantive restrictions or

constraints on competition.

2

interests are not within the, quote, zone of interests

3

Congress sought to protect.

4

QUESTION:

Thus, the banks' competitive

Well, how do you reconcile that

5

petition -- position, Mr. Waxman, with our decision in the

6

Clarke case?

7

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Well, Justice Rehnquist, in

8

Clarke, this Court determined that the plaintiffs, the

9

security industry, had standing because it found that

10

Section -- Sections 36 and 81 of the McFadden Act, which

11

were the substantive provisions at issue there, had been

12

enacted to reflect a, quote, congressional concern to keep

13

national banks from obtaining monopoly power over credit

14

and money through unlimited branching.

15

Congress -- the Court found, Congress had arguably

16

legislated against the very competition that the

17

securities interest was seeking to challenge.

18

And, therefore,

In this case, the common bond provision, in

19

particular, and even the Federal Credit Union Act in

20

general, was not enacted with any thought to restrict or

21

control competition in any way.

22

to provide a means for strengthening the development of

23

credit institutions.

24
25

QUESTION:

It was enacted in order

Well, Mr. Waxman, the -- the

Investment Company Institute v. Camp case was enacted, of

course, to restrict competition.

2

there, didn't we?

3

GENERAL WAXMAN:

And we found standing

You did, Justice O'Connor.

And

4

I think it's fair to acknowledge that that case, at least

5

in our view, represents the outer limits of where this

6

Court has gone in zone of interest.

7

QUESTION:

Yeah, I think that's the -- the

8

closest case for the standing argument.

9

you get around that?

10

I mean, how do

GENERAL WAXMAN:

think -- I

11

think it is -- and I think it's important and can be

12

readily distinguished in three ways.

13

although the Court acknowledged that the principle reason

14

for enacting Section 16 of the Glass-Steagall Act had been

15

to protect banks from engaging in investment activities of

16

their own sake, the Court, both in the opinion in

17

Investment Company Institute, and subsequently in Clarke,

18

also noted that Congress had been concerned with, quote,

19

the danger to the economy as a whole.

20

only reason.

First of all,

So it wasn't the

21

But, more importantly, the basis for the holding

22

in Investment Company Institute was that Section 16 of the

23

Glass-Steagall Act was legislation against competition.

24

The Court found in that case that Congress had legislated

25

against the competition that the petitioners sought to

2

broadest possible way -- and I would simply adopt Justice

3

Harlan's characterization of the majority opinion in that

4

case in dissent -- he said, if Congress prohibited entry

5

into a field of business for reasons relating to

6

competition, then a competitor has standing to seek

7

observance of the prohibition.

8

9

So even if you construe that case in the

Now, he thought that that was a holding that was
not warranted by the Court's prior precedence.

But even

if that is what Investment Company Institute v. Camp

stands for, that's not this case.

13

to do with competition.

reason for enacting the common bond --

15

QUESTION:

The common bond

They were not -- there was not a

But in order to find out the answer

16

to that question, what was the reason for enacting the

17

common bond, must we go back into the legislative history?

18

GENERAL WAXMAN:

I think you do, because

19

prudential -- the prudential standing inquiry this Court

20

has taught is an analysis of what Congress intended; that

21

is, the interest -- to quote Association of Data

22

Processors -- the interest sought to be protected by the

23

complainant must be arguably within the zone of interest

24

to be protected by the statute.

GENERAL WAXMAN:

1

So you must determine what the

2

zone of interest to be protected by the statute was.

3

here it was clearly an intent to foster the development --

4

the rapid development of stable and strong credit unions,

5

because -- and I think it's also important to -- to

6

understand this -- in 1934, when Congress was considering

7

enactment of the Federal Credit Union Act, the country was

8

beginning to come out of the Great Depression.
QUESTION:

9
10

That --

Well, it just came out of the Great

Depression and the War.
GENERAL WAXMAN:

11
12

And

The banks -- it was in the

Great Depression.

13

QUESTION:

Yeah.

14

GENERAL WAXMAN:

The banks had failed in great

15

numbers.

But, for the past 10 or 15 years, there had been

16

developed state-chartered credit institutions, many --

17

most characterized by the existence -- or formed around a

18

common bond.

19

replete with recognition that notwithstanding the banks'

20

record during the Great Depression, not a single

21

state-chartered credit union had failed.

22

Congress wanted to do, in enacting the Federal Credit

23

Union Act, was replicate the success of the

24

state-chartered institutions.

GENERAL WAXMAN:

QUESTION:

Wow.

Justice Ginsburg.

If we go to the zone test, which is

you're arguing that -- that the banks are outside the

10

zone, I believe that test was first introduced in an

11

opinion by Justice White, where he said, it's only

arguably within the zone.

So I would assume one need not
One could see if a

And further, didn't Justice White say that this
was not a -- a difficult test to meet?

GENERAL WAXMAN:

QUESTION:

Well --

He was, in that opinion, expanding

19

standing beyond what it had been up until then.

20

explained that this test was rather easier to meet.

GENERAL WAXMAN:

And he

Justice Ginsburg, the zone of

22

interest, which I believe was first articulated in the

23

Data Processing case, was a case that was decided with

24

explicit reference to the legislative history in order to

determine Congress' purpose; that is, who Congress

2

this -- in that case was Section 4 of the National Banking

3

Act.

4

The substantive statute at issue in

And in analyzing the standing question, the

5

Court looked, basically, to two sources:

6

legislative history and the extensive comments in the

7

legislative history that showed that Section 4 was -- and

8

I am quoting the Court now -- a response to the fears

9

expressed by a few senators that without such a

first, the

10

prohibition, the bill would have enabled banks to engage

11

in non-banking activity, and thus constitute a serious

12

exception to the excepted policy which strictly limits

13

banks to banking.

Now,

legislative history -- if legislative history is the

proper source of this,

But I think, Justice Scalia, in response to your

point, it's also very important, in looking at the Court's

opinion in Data Processing, which is the landmark case

Court made explicit reference to two of its prior

decisions in competitor standing cases:

consistent with those prior competitor standing cases.

And it characterized its decision in

17

what this Court stated in Harden v.

18

its 1968 opinion.

It said:

This Court has, it is true, repeatedly held that

1924, that where the particular statutory provision

to require compliance with that provision.

the extent the legislative history reflects anything at

the banks would have been very active in opposition to

this bill had this interpretation been written explicitly

9

into the statute.

10

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Well, then, I think the answer

11

is that the banks would have the same remedy now that they

12

would have had then, which is to go to Congress and ask

13

for a legislative adjustment.

14

turning to the merits -- if the statute is, as we argue,

15

ambiguous -- that is, that the phrase "groups having a

16

common bond," can just as easily be interpreted to mean

17

groups, each having its own common bond or groups all

sharing a single common bond, the agency's interpretation

must be given deference.

No, but his argument is they -- they

be clear on one point.

Is, essentially, your standing

2

argument that there could be no challenger to this in the

court; that, essentially, the logical challenger, the

banks, are out; so this would be, essentially, immune from

GENERAL WAXMAN:

QUESTION:

GENERAL WAXMAN:

9

Not at all, Justice Ginsburg.

We think the logical

challengers are in fact the same kind of parties that have

been challenging chartering decisions.

And that is

GENERAL WAXMAN:

QUESTION:

8

Well --

That -- economic advisability sounds

to me something like a competitive possibility.

9

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Here -- here's the reason.

10

Because the agency has interpreted economic advisability,

the statutory term, to mean, quote, that it will be a

12

viable institution, and its chartering will not materially

13

affect the interest of other credit unions or the credit

Justice Souter, the banks,

QUESTION:

But if they had --

But what about the answer to my

question?
GENERAL WAXMAN:

6

-- if they had, I would argue

7

that they do not have standing, because the evident

8

purpose of that statutory provision was to make sure that

9

when the NCUA charters a credit union, it does so, taking

10

cognizance of the interests of other credit unions and the

11

credit union system, not the banks.
QUESTION:

12

Well, that certainly is included.

13

But it seems to me that in this argument -- and I -- and I

14

thought in the argument you were -- you were making

15

earlier, you are making the assumption that there can only

16

be one purpose, or that there is at least a predominant

17

purpose, and that controls.

18

in our cases for that?

MR. HELFER:

Yes.

I'll be happy to answer that,

In the first place, the banks did testify at the

Mr. Berengren, who was the -- Bergengren, pardon me, who

21

The banks testify, and they testified about their

22

competitive concerns with the act.

23

Congress made a change relating to demand

deposits, and Congress then carried forward that change

into the Federal Credit Union Act.

Do you

What the D.C. Circuit does is, in trying to

QUESTION:

6

Could the bank say, hey, you're getting too big?
MR. HELFER:

Well, I think if that were part of

13

this test, that sounds very much to me like the McFadden

I think on that basis I would conclude yes.

when I go to that legislative history I do not find one

So where is that?

Now, will you tell me that were in the legislative

MR. HELFER:

9

QUESTION:

10

MR. HELFER:

That is in --- that would be helpful.
That is in -- you have to start

11

with the legislative history of the D.C. Credit Union

12

legislation, which was passed in 1932, okay.

13

At the hearings on that act, Senator Kean said,

14

I agree with the President that we ought to go very slowly

15

with anything that will interfere with banks at the

16

present time.

17

those same --

18

That's in the 1932 hearings at page 31.

QUESTION:

But that's on a different --a

19

different provision.

20

happened in a whole different law.

21

MR. HELFER:

At

I mean, you're referring us to what

Justice O'Connor, this law, and my

22

colleagues agree, is the precursor to the Federal Credit

23

Union Act, and Mr. Bergengren, who was the sole witness on

24

the Federal act, referred to the D.C. act as a copy.

25

That's at 1933 hearings at page 29.

You do not have the banks complaining about the

for it.

16

the Government, at tab 2, at page 24, in which

17

wrote it in the Bankers Association Journal to reassure

the banks that the credit union system wouldn't be a

competitor because -- and this is a quote now -- "credit

unions are organized within specific groups" and have to

21

meet the common bond requirement.

1

The overall reading is that the credit union

2

advocates wanted the common bond for their own purposes,

3

recognized that it would help to make sure that the banks

4

didn't oppose the bill, at a time in which -- the

5

congressional goal was not to injure or hurt the banks.

The goal was to restore the banking system to health,

which is why they passed the Banking Act of 1933.

13

Mr. Roberts conceded that point.

QUESTION:

He said --

Mr. Heifer, aren't there other

limitations that would prevent this infinite progression?
MR. HELFER:

There are at the -- there are other

limitations that the agency has imposed in its discretion,

18

like not letting credit unions compete with one another.

19

Those are not statutory.

the language ambiguous, and we know that some Members of

9

What credit, if any, should we give to

MR. HELFER:

Well, the agency and its

predecessors interpreted the common bond clause to require

10

one common bond per credit union from the time of

11

enactment until 1982, nearly 50 years, and from the time

12

of enactment and for that long is strong evidence about

Perhaps I ought to skip Dimension

(Laughter.)

5

MR. HELFER:

The -- in Dimension, in any event,

6

the agency came in and said, we need to construe the

7

definition of bank in the Bank Holding Company Act so as

8

to reach institutions that are so-called nonbank banks,

9

and that there were strong public policy reasons to do it.

10

The agency here says there's strong public

11

policy reasons to have a multiple unlimited common bond

12

requirement provision, and that's properly addressed to

13

Congress, as in Dimension, where Congress, after this

14

Court's decision, made the change.

15

Going back to the parallel clauses for one

16

moment, the community credit union clause, the agency

17

agrees, does require every community credit union to have

18

a single common bond of community, but it says the

19

preceding and parallel clause in the statute permits this

20

unlimited number of members, and we submit, with all

21

respect, that doesn't make any sense.

22

Both clauses are doing the same work in the

join any one credit union.
