ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. STENBERG

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
GENERAL STENBERG:

10
11

Thank you.

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
This case presents the question of whether a

12

13

defendant in a potential capital case has a constitutional

14

right to effectively charge himself with crimes not

15

charged by the prosecution and which are not lesser

16

included offenses of the crimes that were charged by the

17

prosecution, and to have his jury instructed on those

18

offenses.

19

In Beck v. Alabama, this Court had said -- said

20

that if a lesser included offense exists under State law

21

and is supported by the evidence, that an instruction on

22

that lesser included offense must be given at the request

23

of the defendant.

24

with two counts of felony murder.

2

attempted perpetration of a first degree sexual assault.
The Respondent did not ask to have his jury-

3

instructed on the lesser included offense of first degree

4

sexual assault, which does exist as a lesser included

5

offense under Nebraska law.

6

to have his jury instructed on second degree murder and

7

manslaughter.

Instead, the Respondent asked

8

For 100 years, the Nebraska Supreme Court has

9

clearly and consistently held that second degree murder

10

and manslaughter are not lesser included offenses of

11

felony murder in the State of Nebraska.

12

QUESTION:

Was -- was the manslaughter that he

13

asked for the instruction on involuntary manslaughter, in

14

other words killing in the course of committing an

15

unlawful act?

16

GENERAL STENBERG:

I don't recall, Your Honor,

17

if the requested instruction was -- was specific as to

18

which of the types that it was.

19

QUESTION:

Well, would he have been correct

20

if -- if he had asked for that?

21

included of - - of the felony murder charge?

22

GENERAL STENBERG:

Isn't that a lesser

No, Your Honor, it is not,

23

for a couple of reasons.

24

Nebraska Supreme Court has said that it's not.

25

QUESTION:

Of course, for 100 years, the

I know.

You have said that.

I don't

understand why --

2

GENERAL STENBERG:

Well, the -- there's two --

3

there's really two answers.

4

answer that has been given by the Nebraska Supreme Court

5

over the years, which is simply to say that -- that there

6

are two different intents involved.

7

murder, the intent involved looks at the intent to commit

8

the underlying felony.

9

sexual assault.

One is the more general

Under a felony

In this case, the first degree

Under first degree premeditated murder,

10

second degree murder and manslaughter, the focus is on the

11

intent to kill or the intent to commit the murder.

12

In answering your question, Your Honor, we have

13

to ask what unlawful act are we referring to.

14

are - - are referring to the unlawful act alleged by the

15

prosecutor, namely, first degree sexual assault, then

16

felony murder and manslaughter are identical offenses.

17

QUESTION:

If we

What -- what about the -- what about

18

the lesser sexual -- isn't there is -- what is it - - I

19

guess second degree sexual assault, which -- which does

20

not involve penetration?

21

GENERAL STENBERG:

Yes, Your Honor.

In the case

22

of serond degree sexual assault, to answer your question,

23

we need to think about what the purpose of our

24

manslaughter statute is.

25

manslaughter statute in the commission -- killing in the

And the purpose of the

1

commission of an unlawful act is that if someone is

2

committing an unlawful act and someone is killed, that --

3

that makes things worse.
Well, manslaughter is a class III felony under

4
5

Nebraska law.

Second degree sexual assault is also a

6

class III felony under Nebraska law.

7

no - - there would never be a case where a prosecutor

8

would - - would need to charge manslaughter where you have

9

a second degree sexual assault that you've already proved.

So there would be

wanted to, he could charge it, couldn't he?

We certainly could, Your

But the -- but the concept of lesser -QUESTION:

But if we assume that such a charge

17

is possible under Nebraska law, then why isn't it a lesser

18

included of the charge here?

19

GENERAL STENBERG:

Well, of course, the

20

prosecutor could have charged any number of crimes.

21

doesn't make them lesser included offenses of some of

22

these other crimes.

QUESTION:

1

the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter

and the unlawful act that I have in mind is, if I've got

this right second -- second degree sexual assault, why

4

would that not have been a request for a lesser included

meaning of that?

Right.

Well, the Nebraska

Supreme Court has not spoken to that specifically.

No, but just -- just as an analytical

matter.

GENERAL STENBERG:

QUESTION:

14

GENERAL STENBERG:

Right, exactly.

Why -- why wouldn't it -Well, as an analytical

15

matter, I just -- I don't think it fits the conceptual

framework.

case, a killing -- in order to get the same punishment, a

class III felony.

It simply makes no sense to -- to have the

QUESTION:

No, but you're saying the prosecutor

21

might not have brought this as an original charge.

And

I -- I can see your point.

23

you're making.

why, within the meaning of Beck, this involuntary

second degree sexual assault, is not, just as an

2

analytical matter, a lesser included offense within the

3

meaning of Beck.

4

doesn't apply here, but I just want to get straight that

5

if he had asked for it, that either would or would not

6

have been a -- a well-taken point.

There may be other reasons why Beck

GENERAL STENBERG:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Well --

And it strikes me as though it would

be a well-taken point.
GENERAL STENBERG:

Well, I understood Beck, Your

11

Honor, to rely on the State's own definition of lesser

12

included offenses.

13

impose a Federal definition.

I did not understand Beck to -- to

QUESTION:

15

well, I'm not sure.

16

assumed that there -- for purposes of Beck, that there was

17

a Federal definition of what a lesser included offense is.

18

But assuming -- assuming for the sake of argument that

19

lesser included offense under Beck is -- is a -- is a --

20

is a -- a Federal term, subject to Federal definition,

21

would this, just as an analytical matter, have been a

22

lesser included offense?

23

Well, I assume that -- that Beck's -I mean, I -- I thought Beck probably

No, Your Honor, it would not.

And, of course, first of all, I strongly disagree with the

premise that -- that -- that the definition of lesser

No, you may be right.
But accepting that --

But I'm -- I'm just saying assume it

for the sake of argument.
GENERAL STENBERG:

Well, all -- I guess all I

can do is repeat -- try and repeat, maybe in -- in

8

slightly different words, the same -- the same point that

9

I've made - QUESTION:

10

General Stenberg, is one reason

11

you're having difficulty on this point is that the

12

Nebraska Supreme Court has never spoken to it?

13

right?

14

GENERAL STENBERG:

Well, the -- the Nebraska

15

Supreme Court has never analyzed it in that way.

16

have clearly spoken to it many times.

I do not recall that they

Even if you assume that second degree

QUESTION:

May -- may I ask -- and maybe it's

the same question again -- but what are the elements under

Nebraska law of involuntary manslaughter?

7

GENERAL STENBERG:

Your Honor, there's -- the --

8

the statute has two different ways of reaching that.

9

is -- is without malice --a killing without malice, upon

One

QUESTION:

There must be a killing.

And what is

the second element of it?
GENERAL STENBERG:

A killing without malice upon

14

a sudden quarrel.

15

defined by Nebraska law is a killing that is unintentional

16

during the commission of an unlawful act.

17

QUESTION:

The -- the other type of manslaughter

All right.

Now, is it -- is it not

18

possible that on the facts of this case, they could have

19

found that there was a killing that was unintentional in

20

the course of a sexual assault?

21

GENERAL STENBERG:

22

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, but --

And -- and is it not also true that

23

in order to find him guilty -- what they did find him

24

guilty of, they had to find some additional elements?

No, Your Honor.

GENERAL STENBERG:

Well, Your Honor, that -- I

of the reason, perhaps,

it would seem to be almost

QUESTION:

Well, it knows that one is less

serious than the other.

That's the whole point of Beck.

GENERAL STENBERG:

Well, but if they have the

5

its instructions, it could not logically acquit of the

6

greater and convict of the lesser.

7

instruction would be given in Nebraska, or in most courts,

the possib -- one of the -- the rationale is that there

must be evidence on which the jury could acquit of the

QUESTION:

No, but doesn't --

QUESTION:

Will you -- you tell us again, are

GENERAL STENBERG:

19

of Nebraska jurisprudence and -- and -- and say that --

20

try and say that -- that manslaughter is the lesser

I suppose the prosecutor

prosecutor is charging different elements.

Here he's

So he can say, gee, we'll either hang a person

Because the jury would either have to convict of both of

QUESTION:

I suppose you would say, too, that

Furman and the whole line -- it would be arbit -- it would

the question that Justice Stevens was asking probably is

the same as the one that I -- I've been asking.

involuntary manslaughter consist of an unintentional

killing together with a second degree sexual assault?

included, isn't it?

prove an intended penetration.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY W. MCLEESE, III

2

UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

3

SUPPORTING PETITIONER

4
5

MR. MCLEESE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and my it

please the Court:
The ruling of the Eighth Circuit in this case

6

7

reflects two critical errors of law.

First, that a State

8

can never rely on its own law as a basis for denying a

9

lesser offense instruction in a capital case, and, second,

10

that this Court's decisions in Tyson and Enmund are

11

relevant to the question of whether such instructions are

12

constitutionally required under Beck.

13

As to the first error, this Court's decisions in

14

Hopper and Spaziano made clear that a State may decline to

15

give lesser offense instructions in a capital case based

16

on the application of State law principles, such as the

17

requirement that there be evidence to support the giving

18

of those lesser offense instructions or that the lesser

19

offenses be -- be available as a matter of State statute

20

of limitations law.
And it is surely reasonable for State courts to

21
22

decline to give lesser offense instructions on offenses

23

that are not necessarily included in the charged

24

offenses -- what might be called lesser unincluded

25

offenses.

A requirement --a constitutional requirement

that State courts instruct on such offenses would be

2

utterly unworkable.
As this Court's decisions in Dixon and Schmuck

question of whether Beck brings with it the federally

My question is, in your view, could

the State court say, well, we agree that -- that the

capital offense has three elements in it and we also agree

21

that the -- some other offense has only two of those

22

elements in it, and otherwise they're exactly the same.

24

lesser included offense.

Those issues were never confronted, so far as

QUESTION:

7

MR. MCLEESE:

No.

And the Eighth Circuit's

8

The analysis of

question whether these would be lesser included offenses

11

or not.

12

13

have a substantial impact on Federal prosecution.

And that's the ruling that we sought to

14

That ruling, which would constitutionalize a

15

lesser unincluded offense doctrine that this Court -- this

16

Court has repudiated in Schmuck and in Dixon, is entirely

17

untenable.

18

I - - I should try to mention one thing about

19

Nebraska law, although I don't profess to expertise in it.

20

I think that there is at least one possible respect --

21

again, I'm speculating, because Nebraska has never

22

confronted this question -- in which involuntary act

23

manslaughter might not be a lesser included offense even

24

on an elements test.

25

defines unlawful act manslaughter, it requires -- it

If you look at the statute which

SUITE 400

1

appears to require that the murder in fact be

2

unintentional rather than -- rather than intentional.

3

If, as there is some suggestion in Nebraska law,

4

that that's an element of the offense, that you can't have

5

an intentional killing that would be an involuntary

6

manslaughter, then they are not greater and lesser.

7

Because I could commit a felony murder through an

8

intentional killing in the course of a felony that would

9

not be eligible for treatment as an involuntary

10

manslaughter.
QUESTION:

11

But -- but the intent here is -- is a

12

little difficult.

13

murder was not charged because there was no intent.

14

yet when they get to the death eligibility phase, they

15

have to say there's intent to comply with Edmunds.

16

seems to me -- I don't understand the consistency of that

17

positi on.

18

As I understand it, second degree

killing, and at least -- well, some culpable state -QUESTION:

So that if you're the actual killer

under Edmund, the intent to kill need not be shown?
MR. MCLEESE:

The lower courts have taken that

5

view of Enmund.

But the other problem with the reliance

6

upon Enmund as affecting the Beck analysis is that this

7

Court, in Cabana, made very clear that that's not a

8

determination that is relevant to the State's power to
define the elements of capital offenses.

It is a

10

determination that is relevant solely at the time of

11

sentencing to determine whether or not a capital sentence

12

can in fact be imposed.

13

And so it -- I don't -- I think it's --

14

QUESTION:

15

State is having it both ways.

16

Well, it still seems to me, then, the

MR. MCLEESE:

Again, I don't believe so.

There

17

are many aspects of capital sentencing that may or may not

be - - may arise in the sentencing proceedings that the

1

State is not obliged to affirmatively establish at the

20

time of the -- the trial.

21

And, again, it's important that, even on the

22

broadest reading of Tyson and Enmund

there is no

23

requirement of a showing of actual intent to kill as

24

opposed to a far less demanding culpable state.

25

don't think it's correct to say that there is anything

So I

1

close to a direct tension, leaving aside the procedural

2

differences between the Tyson/Enmund line of cases and the

3

State's approach to the definition of felony murder or

4

its --of lesser grades of homicide.

5

But just to complete the thought about Nebraska

6

law and why it may well be the case under Nebraska law

7

that involuntary manslaughter is not a lesser included

8

offense even under an elements test.

9

Respondent's brief, the Al-Zubaidy case, which I think is

In a case cited in

10

reported at 559, Northwest 2d, the Nebraska Court of

11

Appeals held that in fact there's no such thing as

12

attempted involuntary manslaughter.

13

that, it said because attempt carries with it the idea

14

that you are intending to commit the offense in question.

15

And involuntary manslaughter has a constituted feature of

16

it that it is an unintentional killing.

17

And when it said

And that mode of analysis, if applied here, I

18

think would strongly suggest that in fact applying an

19

elements test, that involuntary manslaughter is not a

20

lesser included offense.

21

QUESTION:

May I go back to Justice Kennedy's

22

question for just a moment.

Isn't it correct that the 100

23

years of jurisprudence in Nebraska about felony murder not

24

having any lesser included offenses all turns on the fact

25

that there's no intent element even as comparable to that

in Tyson and Enmund?

MR. MCLEESE:

3

QUESTION:

4

Yes.

That's the missing element of all

this?

5

MR. MCLEESE:

6

QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes.

And if constitutionally there must be

7

such -- some sort of intent in order to justify the death

8

penalty, why is it such a stretch to say that we'll treat

9

it as a lesser included offense in regard to what the

10
11

total proof that the State must offer is?
MR. MCLEESE:

This Court, in Cabana, made clear

12

that that principle, that at least with people who are not

13

the actual killers, there may be a requirement of culpable

14

mental state, is not one that affects the power of the

State to define the elements of the offense.

QUESTION:

MS. HUTCHINSON:

-- first degree sexual assault

I thought the question was, well,

what is a lesser included offense?

MS. HUTCHINSON:

So the question is, once a

State has erected this artificial barrier by saying

there's no lesser included offense, when our common sense

tells us we can analyze the evidence or the elements,

2

without reliance upon lesser included offense analysis,

3

there's no meaningful distinction.

4

QUESTION:

It's an artifice.

But when you say it's quite obvious

5

that there is one, that depends on -- on how you define

6

lesser included offense, whether that's a Federal --a

7

Federal concept -- and there are some -- some logical

8

rules based upon the elements or upon what's proven at

9

trial, or whether what's a lesser included offense depends

10

on whatever the State says is a lesser included offense.

11

That's a conceivable thing, isn't it?

12

MS. HUTCHINSON:

Normally it is.

But in

13

Nebraska we have the additional issue of this statute that

14

says homicide is but one offense.

15

v. Vosler, they say we're not constrained by the

traditional lesser included offense analysis when it comes

17

to homicide because of 29-2027.

Yes, but we've already gotten over

19

that, because the -- because the -- General Stenberg said

lesser included offense.

MS. HUTCHINSON:

Here that seems

that that's felony murder.

There's a
