ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK GRANGER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GRANGER:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Debra Lewis was charged, tried, and convicted

10
11

under an assimilated Louisiana murder statute for a crime

12

which was committed on a military reservation in Vernon

13

Parish, Louisiana.

14

the appropriate Federal murder statute.

She was not charged nor tried under

On appeal, the Fifth Circuit agreed and reversed

15
16

the conviction based upon the assimilated Louisiana

17

statute, finding that it did not apply, and that the

18

Assimilative Crimes Act did not allow the prosecutor to

19

assimilate the State statute when, in fact, a Federal

20

murder statute prohibited the conduct for which she was

21

charged.

22

However, the Fifth Circuit then affirmed the

23

life imprisonment sentence based upon her conviction of

24

second degree Federal murder.

25

affirmance of the sentence is harmful and prejudicial to

We also contend that the

1

Debra Lewis because under the sentencing guidelines

2

applicable to Federal second degree murder, such a

3

sentence could not be imposed.

4

For purposes of this argument, the Assimilative

5

Crimes Act is a longstanding Federal statute which merely

6

is a gap-filling and a loophole-closing statute.

7

purpose of the statute was to prevent and allow the

8

Federal Government to prosecute criminal actions on

9

military reservations on territory under exclusive Federal

The

10

jurisdiction when, by assimilating a State criminal

11

statute if, and only if, there was no Federal statute

12

which made the conduct sort to be prosecuted -QUESTION:

13

Well, I'm not sure that's the

14

backdrop against which that was adopted.

15

was considerable sentiment at the time that basically

16

State law ought to apply to crimes committed in areas that

17

the Federal Government was administering, and what do you

18

think our policy should be in general, to find that State

19

law should apply where possible, because that is the

20

backdrop under which this statute was passed in the first

21

place.

22

MR. GRANGER:

I think there

Yes, Justice O'Connor, I under --

23

I agree with you, but once the Assimilative Crimes Act was

24

adopted initially in approximately 1825, it was because

25

Congress at that particular point in time had not taken a

1

very proactive role in adopting criminal statutes, so what

2

happened was, you'd have a person commit an act or a

3

criminal -- or a crime on a military reservation or in the

4

territories and then be able to flaunt and get away with

5

it.
So as Justice Story has been noted to say, that

6

7

necessity -- in fact, he was one of the authors of part of

8

the Assimilative Crimes Act, along with Daniel Webster, in

9

saying that we have to allow these crimes to be punished

10

and close -- my words, close the loopholes or fill the

11

gap.

12

There is great sentiment to apply State law on

13

these reservations.

14

U.S.C. section 13, which I have at page 5 of my brief, the

15

original brief, it says, whoever is guilty of any act or

16

omission which, although not made punishable by any

17

enactment of Congress.

18

However, Congress has spoken.

In 18

So in times past, and in this particular case

19

before 1909, when there was no Federal murder statute,

20

clearly the Government would have been faced with a

21

proposition that it couldn't prosecute for murder, so

22

obviously they had to assimilate the State crime and say

23

we can't allow you to get away with this, and so we'll

24

take the State crime, and by section 13, it becomes a

25

Federal crime and we prosecute it.

1

I think in this particular case we get to the

2

point of whether the particular act is made punishable by

3

an enactment of Congress, and I think that the statutes

4

are clear again.

5

statute at 18 U.S.C. section 1111, which you'll find at

6

page 5 and 6 of my brief.

7

Congress has adopted the Federal murder

This statute clearly sets forth a comprehensive

8

scheme of murder.

9

between first degree and second degree murder.

10

11

As in most States, there's a difference
Congress

has done the same thing.
Congress has found that there would be first

12

degree murders, which are generally murders, or killing of

13

human beings with malice aforethought, but also

14

premeditated murders such as poison, lying-in-wait, or

15

again they have another group of murders that are

16

specifically listed as first degree murders, which is

17

arson, escape, murder, kidnapping, treason, espionage,

18

sabotage, aggravated sexual abuse, or sexual abuse,

19

burglary, or robbery.

QUESTION:

Was that true in 1993?

QUESTION:

They were there.

3

MR. GRANGER:

However, the statute is also

4

clear, it says any other murder, and that is explicit,

5

that are not listed as first degree murder is murder in

6

the second degree.
I think the Federal murder statute is very

8

9
10
11

clear -QUESTION:

Well, a little bit depends on how you

come at it, doesn't it, Mr. Granger?
I mean, I think you're analyzing it and very

12

likely quite proper in saying, here's how Congress treated

13

murder, but if you say, how did Congress treat offenses

14

against juveniles, then you would come at it in a somewhat

15

different way.

16

MR. GRANGER:

I don't entirely agree with that,

17

Mr. Chief Justice.

18

specified this statute is merely to set forth the crimes

19

in two broad categories that are fairly com -- that are

20

comprehensive.

I think the way that Congress has

21

However, Congress also has another way of doing

22

this, because I know the issue here is murder of a child.

23

However, if we looked at the sentencing

24

guidelines -- I believe it's section 381.2 -- which

25

provides for an enhancement under the murder statute for a

vulnerable victim, clearly, Congress then decided that

2

when you have younger persons we have to make an allowance

3

and enhance the penalty.

4

QUESTION:

But that wasn't just under the

5

Federal murder statute, was it?

6

for all Federal crimes.

7

MR. GRANGER:

That's for all sentencing

Correct, Your Honor, and that is

8

merely to take into account the fact that some people are

9

more vulnerable to crimes, such as older people, pigeon

10

drops, or things of that nature, or in our particular

11

situation here, where you have a younger person, a child

12

who is being abused, who is actually being killed by a

13

step-parent, a parent and a step-parent.

14

However, the theory of the statute is

15

comprehensive, and it takes into consideration this

16

particular act, whereas --

it talks about the nature of the offense.

At other points

It seems to me what you're saying now that

Congress has addressed the general subject area, and that

that should suffice.

asking us to apply.

MR. GRANGER:

I take it that's the standard you're

What I'm

saying is -8

QUESTION:

1

2

Maybe you're not, but I'm just

I --

3

MR. GRANGER:

Well, my brief, I would admit, is

4

not as articulate as I would like it to have been, but I

5

think the general thought that I was trying to present to

6

the Court is that we have certain conduct, and in this

7

particular case the Federal -- the Congress has enacted a

8

murder statute that takes into account conduct which is

9

normally classified as murder, and that is specifically

10

the killing of a human being.
Whereas, when we look at the Louisiana first

11
12

degree murder statute, it, in much the same way, has

13

broken down murder into first degree and second degree to

14

take into consideration various persons, statuses, or

15

crimes committed within the perpetration or attempt to

16

perpetrate another crime, just like the first degree

17

murder statute in -- that Congress adopted.

18

However, what Louisiana has done is sought to

19

enforce punishment through the differentiation of the

20

types of murder.

21

either a death penalty or life imprisonment without

22

parole, and in second degree murder you have life in

23

prison without parole.

24
25

Whereas in first degree murder you have

However, the conduct, or the act, is the

1

all realize and agree upon that is what murder is, is the

2

killing of a human being.

3

QUESTION:

Do you take the position essentially

4

that the Government does on the criterion -- and, by the

5

way, I'm not suggesting that you give your case away if

6

you do this, but I think you and the Government are

7

getting close, because toward the end of the Government's

8

brief the Government says, if I remember rightly, that the

9

question we should ask is whether Congress has made a

10

considered judgment that the particular peculiarity of

11

State law which might be argued to override the Federal --

12

the general Federal statute should have no bearing, and

13

it's kind of a field preemption sort of concept, and I

14

think that's essentially what you're arguing.

15

MR. GRANGER:

Am I right?

Justice Souter, yes, I believe

16

that's what I'm getting at, but I think I'm trying to make

17

it in a different way.

18

What I'm trying to propose is simply a clear

19

reading of the statutes, because it appears to me that

20

it's fairly clear that Congress has taken over the field

21

of murder, especially after 1909, as it applies to any act

22

which has occurred upon a military reservation, or any act

23

under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal court.

24
25

QUESTION:

But I mean you're saying -- as I

understand it, you're saying that on the basis of reading

1

the congressional statute and saying, in effect, this

2

looks like a statute which is meant to cover the whole

3

waterfront of murder.

4

MR. GRANGER:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. GRANGER:

7

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Yes.
I do agree with that.

Suppose Louisiana had a statute that

8

said, abuse of a child is an offense, juvenile cruelty is

9

an offense.

Then in your view would it be perfectly

10

proper for the U.S. prosecutor to say, I have one charge

11

under the U.S. Code for murder, and a second charge under

12

Louisiana law for cruelty to a juvenile.

3
4

Would that be

compatible?
MR. GRANGER:

Justice Ginsburg, I would think

5

that that's more closely compatible to my analysis of the

6

statutes, and I would -- if I had to concede a point, I

7

would concede that that is more likely to be an

8

appropriate acceptance of the way the statute should work,

9

because under the Louisiana cruelty to a juvenile statute

20

it covers not only cruelty but also it covers neglect, so

21

then you have a different area than, say, the Federal

22

assault statute, where we deal with the actual striking of

23

someone under the age of

24
25

6 or something of that nature.

But there again, we see the difference.

The

chord, or the common chord that goes through these cases,

1

at least in my way of thinking, is the fact we have a

2

killing, and Congress has said, as far as it goes to

3

killing, we've decided what is first degree murder, we

4

have decided what is second degree murder.

5

Now, Louisiana, you can decide whatever you want

6

is murder under your State statutes, and you can apply

7

that to whomever you want, as long as they are your

8

citizens or persons in your State, but when it comes to

9

prosecuting this crime on Federal property, in Federal

10

courts, for an offense against the United States, then

11

we're going to look at what we decide murder is and so as

12

not to get too far afield --

13

QUESTION:

So is your test, then, just that if

14

the congressional statute covers the crime, murder,

15

homicide, then you don't look any further, that's it?

16

MR. GRANGER:

You would not have to look further

17

for the definition of murder.

18

Federal murder statute, not to any Louisiana statutes

19

dealing with murder, yes.

20

QUESTION:

You would look only to the

So it's -- you're advocating a simple

21

test that the Federal statute covers it, that's it.

22

don't augment it in any way.

23

MR. GRANGER:

You

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, because

24

when we -- when I looked at this Court's previous ruling

25

in Williams back in 1946, the issue there really, the way

1

I sum it up, is that you have a competing State and

2

Federal statute.
The Federal statute chose in that case to draw

3
4

the elements of the crime more narrowly, the age of

5

consent being 16, whereas the Arizona statute chose to

6

make the age of consent 18, and this Court held --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. GRANGER:

9

Well --- that we cannot allow a State

statute to somehow enlarge, broaden, or redefine -QUESTION:

10

Well, most Federal courts have

11

interpreted Williams as adopting some kind of a precise

12

acts test.
I don't think the courts generally have applied

13
14

the assimilative crimes statute very literally.

15

broadly, certainly, but they've instead said it's some

16

kind of a precise acts test.

17

approach in most cases?

18

MR. GRANGER:

It reads

Do you agree with that

Justice O'Connor, I agree with

19

that approach, except that I think in a -- the case of a

20

murder versus the case of carnal knowledge versus

21

statutory rape the precise act can only be one act, and

22

that --

23

QUESTION:

Well, how about abuse of a child

24

carried out by beating, and the Federal law just has an

25

assault and battery statute, but the State law has a

specific child abuse statute that would govern, what -- is

2

it assimilated, or not?

3
4

MR. GRANGER:

If I had to choose I would say

it's more like --

5

QUESTION:

I mean, it's so curious, because it

6

all depends on how you frame the generality of the act.

7

The act is the beating of a child.

8

law covers it.

9

State law covers it.

No, it's abusing a child.

Well, then the

How do we know?

MR. GRANGER:

10

Well, then the Federal

I think we have to look at what

11

conduct is being proscribed and whether the statute,

12

whether it be the Federal assault statutes or whether it

13

be a Louisiana cruelty to a juvenile statute, or any State

14

statute that deals with batteries or cruelty to a

15

juvenile, addressed the actual conduct which is being

16

prohibited.

There is that gray --

question?

Well, how do you answer that

Which one applies in the case of beating a

MR. GRANGER:

I would think that if it's

22

specifically beating of a child, that more than likely it

23

would be assimilated, and it has been assimilated under

24

other circuit courts.

However, I think we also have to understand that

1

assault statutes as written are generally very, very

2

broad, and they're -- and they cover a wide range of acts,

3

and in fact they could also, as far as the cruelty to a

4

juvenile statute in Louisiana --

5
6

7

QUESTION:

That's pretty close to saying well,

murder of a child will apply the State law.
MR. GRANGER:

But in the Louisiana scheme work I

8

believe, Justice O'Connor, that what we're talking about

9

is, there is a killing of a child, and what we're looking

10

now at is the way that Louisiana defines murder from first

11

degree to second degree.

12

That is not really the issue, I think, before

13

this Court.

14

through the Federal murder statute, defined this crime

15

and, if so, we don't go to a State statute in order to

16

give us a different burden of proof, to give us different

17

elements of the crime, or to give us different sentences.

18

We look only to the Federal statute.

19

The issue before this Court, has Congress,

And I think that's what makes those type of

20

cases much different than assault cases, or burglary

21

cases, or cases where you have a long range or a wide

22

range of different actions that can be specifically

23

narrowed down.

24
25

QUESTION:

Mr. Granger, you're not really

arguing that we should stick to the words of the statute,

are you?
I mean, the words of the statute say, if the

2

3

act, any act or omission not made punishable by any

4

enactment of Congress.

5

be an act or omission which is not made punishable by any

6

enactment of Congress.

That's the condition.

It has to

7

Now, I assume, if you follow the language of the

8

statute and you beat somebody to death and Congress had an

9

assault statute but not a murder statute, that would be

10

covered by that language, wouldn't it?

11

MR. GRANGER:

12

QUESTION:

I think that --

You could not prosecute under State

13

law for the murder, because the act or omission was

14

punishable.
What he did, the beating of this person which

15
16

resulted in death, but that was the act or omission, it is

17

punishable, so you would only be able to prosecute under

18

Federal law for assault and no murder prosecution, right?
MR. GRANGER:

No, Justice Scalia, I disagree

with that, because I think that we have two different

9

has given it a literal interpretation?

10
11
12

13

If so, what one

and what case?
MR. GRANGER:

The -- I know of none, Justice

O'Connor, that has given it that interpretation.
But I think the issue here is that when we talk

14

about something such as an assault, which is a very

15

different statute, differently written than a murder, and

16

especially the way that the Federal Congress has defined

17

murder in this case, that it's kind of like mixing apples

18

and oranges together, because assaults do not entail

19

murder, or necessarily.

20

You could have an assault in which someone dies,

21

and then you may be charged with both crimes, but, of

22

course, the murder would be more inclusive of the actual

23

assault on the person.

QUESTION:

So you want us to define a general

subject in a, sort of a preemption context.

MR. GRANGER:

1

Justice Kennedy, I believe that is

2

the appropriate way to look at this case, because when

3

Williams grappled with this issue a long time ago we were

4

dealing with situations in which you had, I guess, less

5

Federal criminal legislation than you have now.
But even back then we had the murder statute,

6

7

and more importantly, the case was directed at the conduct

8

that was being prosecuted, and the prosecution of a

9

murder, whether it be a person under the age of 12, as in

10

Louisiana first degree murder, or a person over the age of

11

12, it is the murder, that is the act and the conduct that

12

we have to look at.
And the issue then becomes, if Congress has

13
14

chosen to prosecute that particular type of conduct in a

15

certain way, then it would be impermissible to allow the

16

assimilation of a State statute which may define it

17

differently, or may prosecute it differently, or may have

18

different elements of the crime to merely come in to

19

change this Federal statute.
Congress, if it so chooses, can change the

20
21
22

statute.

It can change it -QUESTION:

But why is it the murder that's --

23

what if they had a homicide statute and say, a third -- or

24

a manslaughter provision with negligent driving of a

25

vehicle, or a few other examples, but none that omitted

what is the counterpart to first degree murder, would you

2

say that had dealt with the subject of killing the victim?

3

MR. GRANGER:

Yes, Justice Stevens, because

4

clearly if you look at the murder statutes any other

5

murder than those which are enumerated is going to be

6

murder in the second degree.

7
8

Now, of course, in Federal court, or in the
Federal Criminal Code we do have voluntary and involuntary
manslaughter statutes, but I think that's what Congress is

10
11
12

saying, is that we're specific -QUESTION:

But I want to be sure -- I'm not sure

I understand.

13

MR. GRANGER:

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

Supposing the Federal statute merely

15

went so far as most, say, second degree manslaughter, the

16

very least severe penalty, that's all it covered, would

17

the deliberate killing be covered by the Federal statute

18

or by the State statute?

MR. GRANGER:

If I understand your hypothetical

20

correctly, Justice Stevens, if there were no premeditate

21

or malice aforethought element --

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. GRANGER:

25

In the Federal statute, yes.
-- then certainly that would be a

different type of crime.

MR. GRANGER:

I think you would have to in that

particular instance, because what we're discussing is -QUESTION:

But then why don't you look to State

versus negligence, but rather because the State has chosen

7

to give special protection to youthful victims?

8

MR. GRANGER:

9

QUESTION:

10
11
12

I think that --

I don't quite understand the logic of

your position.
MR. GRANGER:

And maybe I understand the error

of my ways.

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

14

MR. GRANGER:

I think, Justice Stevens, what I

15

would look at is that, depending, I guess, if we do have

16

crimes that may be crimes under Federal law that are not

17

crimes under State law, and clearly we have crimes under

18

State law which are not crimes under Federal law, whether

19

these apply or don't apply is based on whether they occur

20

on Federal property or not, so if Congress said that we're

21

not going to have any of these murders and we're not going

22

to allow these murders to be prosecuted, then I guess you

23

could not prosecute that person for that type of murder.

But if --

MR. GRANGER:

They've just omitted it, but then,

4

I guess, then the prosecution would be for the lowest

element of murder under Federal law, which would be

6

included within, say, the higher type of murder that

7

you're describing, which is with premeditation, or -QUESTION:

8

9

Mr. Granger, now, you say -- one of

the questions you present is not just whether your client

10

was prosecuted under the proper statute, but if the

11

petitioner was not properly prosecuted under the

12

Assimilative Crimes Act, whether or not the sentence was

13

proper.
Now, supposing that we should agree with you on

14
15

your argument under the Assimilated Crimes Act, as the

16

Fifth Circuit did, the Fifth Circuit said nonetheless your

17

client should -- the conviction would be upheld because it

18

was equally a violation of the Federal act.

19
20

Now, what's your position on that before this
Court?
MR. GRANGER:

21

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I'd

22

raised another issue in cert which was, of course, denied,

23

so in that particular respect the second degree murder

24

conviction found by the Fifth Circuit would also be

25

affirmed.

However, the sentence that was imposed, or at

1

2

least allowed to stand by the Fifth Circuit, would need to

3

be vacated and the matter remanded.
QUESTION:

4

So you're not asking for a new trial,

5

then.

a new trial, but you're saying now that all you're asking

7

for is a resentencing under the appropriate statute.

11

At one point in your brief you say something about

MR. GRANGER:

Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice,

yes, because that issue was not -- cert was not granted on
that issue and it's not properly before the Court.
However, I would assume that if this Court

12

thought that that issue needed to be raised it could on

13

its own do so.

14

But in this particular circumstance, no.

The

15

only issue I have here is if you agree that the

16

Assimilative Crimes Act does not apply, then the only

17

remedy my client has is a remand to the Fifth Circuit to

18

vacate the sentence it imposed, and then remand the matter

19

to the district court for resentencing in accordance with

20

the guidelines, which is basically, as I understand the

21

Government's brief --

22

QUESTION:

Yes.

the appropriate measure in this case.
QUESTION:

2

The --

Going back to what's covered or not

3

covered, the point where you are in disagreement with the

4

Government, suppose we have the murder statute that we

5

have on the Federal side, the victim is a pregnant woman,

6

and the State also has a murder statute but then it has a

7

separate crime of feticide.
How would that -- would that be something that

8

9
10

under your theory you could take the murder from the
Federal and the feticide from the State?
MR. GRANGER:

11

Justice Ginsburg, I don't think it

12

would apply because the Federal statute would have

13

encompassed both those acts, because feticide is actually

14

another form of killing, and therefore it would be covered

15

by the Federal murder statute, as any other crime which is

16

not first degree murder is second degree murder.

17

So you may have -- you would have the murder,

18

obviously, of the mother, and then as far as whether --

19

and this is the question I don't know the answer to,

20

whether the Federal murder statute would allow such a

21

claim for an unborn child, then I don't have the answer to

22

that.

23
24
25

If it does, you would have to say two counts of
murder. If not, you'd only have one count.

1

one thing.

2

you referred to the fact that the Federal statute covered

3

it.

4

You referred -- in answering Justice Ginsburg

Is your test an analytical test?
In other words, you can determine it -- you

5

apply it solely by looking at the terms of State statute,

6

in terms of Federal statute, or is it an analytical test

7

plus an intent test, so that at the end of the day you

8

say, can we infer from everything we know, including

9

what's on the face of the statute, that Congress intended

10

to cover this particular conduct exclusively by the

11

Federal statute?

12

ultimately an intent test?

13

Is it a purely analytical test, or is it

MR. GRANGER:

Justice Souter, I believe it's

14

clearly an analytical test because the intent issue

15

clearly is covered within the Federal murder statute if

16

you're thinking of criminal intent, whether it be

17

premeditated or with just malice aforethought.

18

However, in that respect it's an analytical test

19

because the murders -- we're not looking to what State law

20

describes as to what intent should apply, whereas in

21

Louisiana in this particular case you only have the issue

22

of, for first degree murder under Louisiana law, a

23

specific intent to kill, or specific intent to inflict

24

great bodily harm, the death of the person, and the person

25

being under the age of 12.

So it's strictly analytical, because we don't

1

2

look to whether another State or a State statute would

3

describe the intent required to meet the definition of the

4

crime.

5

then Federal law itself then describes what intents are

murder, second degree murder, or voluntary or involuntary

manslaughter.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The text of the Assimilative Crimes Act is set

19

forth at page 2 of the Government's brief, and I think the

20

proper disposition of this case hinges on analysis of two

21

phrases within that statute.

22

or omission, the second is the phrase, made punishable,

23

and I'd like to address them in that order.

24
25

QUESTION:

The first is the phrase, act

It hinges on either observing them or

ignoring them, right?

1

MR. STEWART:

I -- as to the phrase, act or

2

omission, I think it hinges on interpreting them.

3

phrase, act or omission, is often used to refer to a

4

particular incident of primary conduct.

5

Court has frequently stated that a single act may

6

constitute more than one offense, and in that situation

7

it's used in contradistinction to offense.

8

9

The

That is, this

On the other hand, it would not be unnatural to
say, for example, that 18 U.S.C. 1111 defines murder as

10

the act of killing a human being with malice aforethought,

11

in which case the word act would be used not to refer to a

12

particular incident at a particular time and place, but to

13

a category of conduct meeting the requisite

14

specifications, and in our view the words act or omission

15

in this statute should be construed to mean, offense.

16

question is whether the State law offense is made

17

punishable by an enactment of Congress, and I think there

18

are several reasons --

19

QUESTION:

Is it your view, just to sum it up,

20

that we apply the Blockburger test unless there's

21

something in the Federal statute that trumps it?

22

The

MR. STEWART:

I think it's not -- that's not

23

quite our view, because I think -- I'll get to made

24

punishable in more detail, but I think the short answer

25

is, one of the features of the Blockburger test is that a

1

greater and a lesser included offense are treated as the

2

same offense for double jeopardy purposes, and that would

3

not be our position with respect to this statute.

4

That is, if State law has defined a greater

5

offense, we would not say that that has been made

6

punishable by an act of Congress simply because Congress

7

has defined a lesser included offense, as in this case.

8

But to return to the phrase --

9

QUESTION:

The effect of that kind of

10

interpretation is to say that every poor devil who lives

11

in a Federal enclave is subjected to two total systems of

12

criminal law.

13

You think that's what Congress had in mind?

This is a very old statute, and I sort of

14

regarded it as, you know, just to fill in the gaps where

15

there are so many Federal, you know, basic crimes, basic

16

wicked things that were not at that time punished by

17

Federal law.

18

There are very few wicked things that aren't

19

punished by Federal law.

20

halt to the expansion of this Assimilative Crimes Act?

21

Why shouldn't we just call a

I don't know why we want to make everybody

22

subject to twice as many different series of statutes just

23

because they're living on a Federal enclave.

24

it be enough just to say they're subject to Federal law

25

and this thing has either no application any more or it

will be a rare, rare case where it has application?
MR. STEWART:

2

Well, I think first of all it's

3

obviously not unusual for people living outside Federal

4

enclaves to be subject to both Federal and State criminal

5

laws.

6

successive prosecutions by the two sovereigns for the same

7

criminal act.

Indeed, individuals can often be subjected to

8

Now, it's true that individuals residing on

9

Federal enclaves are subject to some Federal criminal

10

provisions that are applicable only to the enclaves, and

11

in that sense they face a distinctive burden.

12

On the other hand, there is no comprehensive

13

Federal Criminal Code applicable to the enclaves.

14

Moreover, an individual on the enclaves has the

15

commensurate advantage that the only prosecution that can

16

be brought will be brought by Federal authorities and,

17

therefore, while individuals residing outside the enclaves

18

may face successive prosecutions for what would be the

19

same offense in Blockburger terms, the individuals on the

20

enclaves will have that added protection.

21

But again, to return to the --

22

QUESTION:

That's a good point.

You're saying

23

that I'm looking at it precisely wrong, that the question

24

is whether -- isn't whether people on the enclaves shall

be subjected to dual criminal laws which other people

So it is subject to both State and

MR. STEWART:

That's exactly right, and I think

7

the resolution of this case ultimately hinges on how the

Court views the concept of applying State law norms on

9

Federal enclaves.

10

That is --

QUESTION:

In fact, the Federal enclave

11

residents may have a better deal, because they are going

to get either one or the other, but people off the enclave

13

may get both.

14

MR. STEWART:

That's correct.

The only

15

sovereign that can prosecute is the Federal Government,

16

although the Federal Government may invoke assimilated

17

State laws.

Were you going to focus on the word

MR. STEWART:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. STEWART:

Let me --

Was that your second -My second -- I do want to focus

briefly at least on the words act or omission, because I

think the meaning of made punishable is easier to follow

if the words act or omission are first made clear.

That is, I think for a variety of reasons it is

1

2

appropriate to interpret the phrase, act or omission, to

3

mean the State law offense that is sought to be

4

assimilated.
First of all, as Justice Scalia pointed out in

5
6

his hypothetical, the contrary reading would create absurd

7

results.

8

the Federal Government had an assault statute but no

9

murder statute a State would -- the Federal Government

That is, in a hypothetical situation in which

10

would be precluded from proceeding on an assimilated State

11

murder charge simply because the primary conduct would

12

have constituted assault under Federal law.

13

To focus on the individual incident of primary

14

conduct would have a second practical infirmity as well.

15

That is, from the standpoint of sound judicial

16

administration it's certainly important that the propriety

17

of an Assimilated Crimes Act prosecution can be determined

18

at the outset of the proceeding, but an indictment

19

typically doesn't contain any lengthy recitation of the

20

primary conduct in which the individual is alleged to have

21

engaged.
It does contain a summary of the essential

22

23

nature and elements of the offense with which he is

24

charged.

favor of Blockburger as the test for double jeopardy.

2

MR. STEWART:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. STEWART:

That's correct.

You have to know it up front.
That's correct, Your Honor, and if

5

the test ultimately turned on whether act, the conduct

6

proved at trial would have violated some Federal statute,

7

first you wouldn't know up front, and second you could

8

even have the bizarre situation in which the defendant

9

attempted to introduce evidence showing that his conduct

10

did, in fact, violate a Federal statute even though the

11

evidence introduced by the prosecution had not shown that,

12

so I think --

13

QUESTION:

But on your theory, I take it we

14

still would not know what offense was the appropriate

15

offense to focus on, and I take it that's the issue that

16

you deal with under the concept of punishables, is that

17

right?

18

MR. STEWART:

Well, I think when we ask whether

19

an offense is made punishable the offense should be the

20

State law crime with which the individual is charged, and

21

in this case it's very clear what that was.

22

The jury was instructed at the close of

23

petitioner's trial that in order to find the petitioner

24

guilty it had to find that she killed Jadasha Lowery, that

25

she acted with intent to kill or do great bodily harm, and

2

that the victim was under 12 years old.
QUESTION:

That --

In other words, if the State law

3

offense is more specifically described, if the level of

4

generality is lower, we look to a State law offense.

5

MR. STEWART:

If -- in determining whether the

6

offense is made punishable we first look to the State law

7

offense as defined by the -- its essential elements, and

8

then the next question is, what does it mean to say that a

9

State law offense has been made punishable by an enactment

10

of Congress, and in our view a State law offense has been

11

made punishable by an enactment of Congress only if

12

Congress has addressed the class of conduct that

13

constitutes the State offense at the same level of

14

specificity as the State.

Now, that will be true most obviously --

That is, in the great majority of cases

So then it isn't just an analytical

enclaves that prohibited adultery, fornication, and what

14

was called carnal knowledge, what is usually termed

15

statutory rape, and the Federal carnal knowledge law set

16

the age of consent at 16, made it a crime to have sexual

17

intercourse with a person not the wife of the wrongdoer

18

who was under the age of 16.

19

The State statute set the age of consent at 18,

20

and the question was whether the use of the Assimilated --

21

Assimilative Crimes Act was precluded by the Federal

22

statute.

23

Now, it was not the case that there was any

24

Federal statute that had precisely the same elements as

the State offense, so part 1 of our test wouldn't be met

1

here, but the Court, surveying all the available evidence,

2

concluded that the reason there was no Federal offense

3

having exactly those same elements was that Congress had

4

considered the matter and had decided that such an offense

5

was not warranted.

6

That is, Congress had considered specifically at

7

what age does an individual become capable of giving

8

meaningful consent to sexual relations.

9

QUESTION:

Doesn't that say that you've got to

10

have your analytical criterion plus something more,

11

because in the Williams case the level of specificity was

12

precisely the same, i.e., certain ages are to be

13

considered in deciding what the offense is.

14

And the issue in Williams, I suppose, was, did

15

Congress intend the details of the level of specificity

16

that it chose to prevail over the details of the level of

17

specificity, age of victim, that the State chose?

18

And so ultimately, and I would suppose even on

19

your specificity criterion, you'd have to say, well, we

20

infer that Congress meant its particular choice of ages to

21

prevail over the State's particular choice of ages.

22

MR. STEWART:

That was certainly the Court's

inference, but -QUESTION:

And is -- doesn't that have to be, as

it were, an adjunct to your analytical test, because at

some times your test is going to produce, as it were, a

2

tie.

You're not going to know.

3

MR. STEWART:

I think that's correct.

That's

4

why I said that assimilation is precluded if either there

5

is a Federal statute with precisely the same elements as

6

the State statute, or -- and I think the second category

7

will be very rare cases -- there is highly persuasive

8

evidence that Congress has considered the matter at the

9

same level of specificity as the State.
QUESTION:

10

So if, in fact, you have a Federal

11

statute that forbids bank robbery in general, then the

12

State could punish a person -- it's assimilated because

13

they have a statute that makes it a crime to forbid -- to

14

rob a State bank.

15

That's all.

You have -- the Federal law says,

16

punishable to rob any bank, and now Louisiana has a

17

statute that says, it's punishable to rob a State bank.

QUESTION:

1

No, no, what -- they are special.

2

They have a special certificate that says the State bank

3

examiner, and they hang that on the wall.
MR. STEWART:

4

It might be the case that if there

5

was nothing different about State banks we could presume

6

that --

7
8

QUESTION:

Well, there is.

They have that

certificate.

9

But the other -- taking the other part of your

10

argument, I take it that the only -- the only difference

11

here, really, is the death penalty, that if, in fact, we

12

assimilate the State law, the defendant's eligible for the

13

death penalty, and if we don't -- I mean, that's what

14

turns on first degree versus second degree.

15

Second degree in Louisiana has a mandatory life

16

without parole, so the only thing putting it in the first

17

degree is the death penalty, and if that's so, if that's

18

all Louisiana's done between going from Louisiana two to

19

Louisiana one, can we really say that Congress has not

20

made any determination about when they want a Federal

21

death penalty?

22

I mean, my thought is that they've been debating

23

that in Congress for 30 years, and it's normally a very

24

hot issue, and when Congress lists a whole lot of crimes

25

and doesn't put on the death penalty but does on some

1

others, how is that any different from the statutory rape?
MR. STEWART:

2

Well, I think the other point that

3

turns -- the other point that depends on choice between

4

the Assimilative Crimes Act and the Federal murder statute

5

is that the Louisiana first degree murder statute provides

6

for a mandatory life sentence even if the death penalty is

7

not sought, whereas the Federal murder statute provides

8

that the defendant may be sentenced to any term of years

9

or for life, so even in this case, where the Government

10

didn't seek the death penalty, it had potential practical

11

significance to the penalty that was imposed.
I think -- to return to Williams, I think in a

12

13

sense we could say that this is the case that Williams

14

would have been had there been no Federal carnal knowledge

15

statute.

16

That is, at the time Williams was decided, there

17

were Federal adultery and fornication statutes that

18

broadly prohibited all acts of sexual intercourse on the

19

Federal enclaves between people who were not married to

20

each other, and I suppose it would have been open to

21

Williams, even in the absence of a carnal knowledge

22

statute, to say Congress has occupied the field.

23

absence of any statutory rape provision should be taken to

24

reflect an implicit determination that Congress believes

25

the age of the parties to be irrelevant --

1

In other words, to look to intent, it

2

would have been an intent argument, an intent of Congress

3

argument.

4

MR. STEWART:

5

QUESTION:

6

7

I think it is an intent of --

May I go behind that with this

question?
What gives me pause about the -- let's say the

8

primacy of your analytical test, so that you get to the

9

intent element only if there's -- if you need a tie­

10

breaker, more or less, my concern about giving the primacy

11

to the purely analytical test is that, with respect to

12

every statute, criminal statute that Congress passes, it

3

will have to remain constantly on guard to see whether a

4

State legislature addresses the general criminal conduct

5

in a slightly more specific way, knowing on your test

6

that, if the State legislature does, suddenly the Federal

7

statute has shrunk.

8

And it's very difficult -- I mean, since we're

9

construing an act of Congress here, it's very difficult

20

for me to believe that Congress would have meant us to

21

interpret it in a way that is in effect going to force

22

Congress to keep its eye on what's going on in every

23

single State legislature whenever it's in session, just to

24

see if the legislature addresses a general problem with a

25

statute of greater specificity than Congress does.

1

What's your response?

2

MR. STEWART:

I think there are two responses.

3

At the most basic level, the reason that Congress is in

4

that predicament, if you want to call it that, is simply

5

that it's enacted the Assimilative Crimes Act.
But the second reason is that up until

6

948, the

7

way the Assimilative Crimes Act was worded it said that

8

people can be prosecuted for committing State crimes that

9

were in effect under the law of the State at the time of

10

the last reenactment of the Assimilative Crimes Act.

11

QUESTION:

But it doesn't say that any more.

12

MR. STEWART:

It doesn't say that any more.

And so up until

3

948 it was possible at least to

4

indulge the fiction that Congress had chosen to assimilate

5

State law because it had individually examined the laws of

6

the States and found them to be good.

7

What Congress did in

948 was in essence say, we

8

trust the States enough to provide for the assimilation of

9

State law offenses that have not even been enacted, that

20

we've had no opportunity to scrutinize, because we see an

21

independent value in maintaining consistency between the

22

law within the enclaves and the law of the surrounding

23

areas.

1

look at the development of the Federal murder statute,

2

that the statute itself doesn't speak to the age of the

3

victim, and one might ask the question, why has Congress

4

failed to enact a child murder provision, and one possible

5

answer would be that Congress has scrutinized laws like

6

Louisiana and finds them to be unwise.

7

Another answer might be, Congress understands

8

that the Assimilative Crimes Act is out there, and is

9

content for child murder provisions either to be enforced

10

or not be enforced.

11

QUESTION:

Well, but Congress has focused a lot

12

on whether it wants a death penalty or not, and in what

13

circumstances.

14

There's been a lot of focus on that.

MR. STEWART:

There has been, and I think

15

this -- the case would present different questions if we

16

attempted to impose the death penalty under the

17

Assimilative Crimes Act.

QUESTION:

No, no, it's the same.

I mean, the

question is whether -- you're arguing that the murder one

statute in Louisiana applies.

the murder two statute applies, do you?

Louisiana, in fact I think the only difference, is the

death penalty.

3

And if you then compare it with the Federal law,

what you discover, as you said, is a big difference, I

would think, is the death penalty, and then in addition

the term of years is longer, so you have both.

That's

The death penalty seems a big part of it.

MR. STEWART:

9

QUESTION:

I think so.

You think so.

I -How do you squeeze

10

that into the word, act or omission?

11

else the Assimilative Crime Act doesn't cover, it surely

12

bears no reference to what the punishment is.

13

MR. STEWART:

I mean, whatever

Well, but the Assimilative Crime

is guilty of an act or omission which is, although not

QUESTION:

A like punishment, as a State law,

20

but as to the question of whether the State law applies or

not, it's a difference in the act or omission which you

want to define as offense, and maybe you can, but there's

no way to define act or omission as punishment, and if you

MR. STEWART:

3

QUESTION:

4

(Laughter.)

5

QUESTION:

I agree with that.

When I --

Of course you agree with that.

But Mr. Stewart, could you remind us

6

of, there was -- the act originally used the word offense,

7

and then it changed it to act or omission, and what was

8

the reason for that?

9
10

11

MR. STEWART:

It first changed it to act or

thing, which was subsequently changed to act or omission.
The reason that was given in the legislative

12

history was that it seemed incongruous to use the

13

phrase -- the word offense to describe something that was

14

not in fact defined as offense by Federal law, and this

15

Court in Williams stated that the expressed intent of the

16

committee was to continue in force rather than to change

17

the substantive meaning of the statute.

18

And again, it would have been easy in

19

Williams -- if the Court had believed in Williams that the

20

phrase, act or omission should refer to a particular

21

incident of primary conduct, it would have been easy for

22

the court in Williams to say, this person would have been

23

guilty of adultery under Federal law, and stopped there.

24
25

The Court instead embarked on a lengthy analysis
of Congress' development of a Federal statutory rape law

and arrived at the conclusion that Congress had implicitly-

2

decided that individuals aged 16 or 17 were capable of

giving meaningful consent to sexual relations.

QUESTION:

Well, why couldn't one decide,

5

looking at this whole picture, as was suggested by

Mr. Granger,

into account the vulnerability of the victim,

9

at it as a whole,

10

I think,

that there's the punishment for

so looking

Congress has essentially dealt with

these elements but in a different way?
MR. STEWART:

11

I think it's fair to say that

12

looking at the system as a whole there is some role to

13

play in considering the age of the victim in sentencing a

14

defendant on a charge of Federal second degree murder.

15

That doesn't mean that Congress has addressed the question

16

at the same level of specificity as the States.

17

And the point I wanted to get back to was, we

18

really don't know why Congress has failed to enact a child

19

murder provision, whether it's because they find such a

20

provision to be undesirable, whether it's because they're

21

content to let the States do what they will on the

22

enclaves, or whether they simply hasn't -- haven't thought

23

about it.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well,

in 1994 they passed a huge law

that has chapters in it like crimes against children,

violence against women, amending the assault statute, and

2

so forth.

3

on this.

4

I thought Congress has now specifically focused

MR. STEWART:

Certainly Congress has addressed

5

some aspects of the problem of violence against children.

6

The point I was making was, Congress has not enacted a

7

provision that speaks directly to the question, when is

8

the age of a murder victim deemed to be a more culpable

9

offense, and I think that what you do with that --

10

QUESTION:

No, but isn't -- doesn't that -- I

11

mean, doesn't Justice Breyer's question raise the same

12

problem, in effect, that Williams raises, because it's

13

quite true Congress did not make this precise category of

14

murder a separate offense the way the State did, so you

15

say, aha, the State statute is at a lower level of

16

generality, at a higher level of specificity, and

17

therefore it prevails.

18

And yet what Congress has done, at least in

19

'94 -- I realize this is a '93 crime, but just for

20

analytical purposes here, what Congress has done is to

21

say, aha, there will be this specific murder category,

22

that specific murder category, that specific category of

23

crimes against children, and that sounds a lot like what

24

was going on in Williams.

25

It sounds as though Congress is saying, yeah, we

1

are, in fact, going to legislate at a very high level of

2

specificity, but we're not going to make a specific murder

3

provision for this particular subcategory, and that sounds

4

a lot like Williams.
And therefore I would suppose that if you follow

5
6

the Williams analysis you would say, both State and

7

Federal are legislating at the same level of specificity,

8

and we think the Federal crime ought to -- if you follow

9

the Williams analogy, we think the Federal -- that

10

Congress' intent was not to assimilate, that the Federal

11

crime would be the sole one because it had addressed the

12

issue and probably meant to occupy the field.

13

Why do you come out differently here?

14

MR. STEWART:

15
16

Well, I think there are two

reasons.
First, we do see a difference in specificity as

17

between this case and Williams.

18

Congress really had focused on the precise question, at

19

what age does an individual become capable of giving

20

legally meaningful consent to sexual relations, and that's

21

on a different level of generality from what Congress has

22

done in the statutes that you refer to, namely, address

23

other parts of the problem of violence against children.

QUESTION:

That is, in Williams,

Congress has said what particular

crimes ought to be defined with reference to children, or

QUESTION:

5

I think --

I mean, this is the -- well, go --

I'm sorry.
MR. STEWART:

I think what is really crucial

6

here is the default rule that the Court adopts.

That is,

7

if the Court's default rule is that application of State

8

law to Federal enclaves should be treated with suspicion,

9

should be reserved for those situations where we really

10

feel quite sure that Congress hasn't spoken to the

11

question at all, then you're right, we lose.

12

Our default rule is that individuals all over

13

the country are normally subject to concurrent State and

14

Federal jurisdiction, and an individual should be

15

insulated from potential prosecution and punishment for

16

State law crimes only if Congress has made it very, very

17

clear that it has addressed the precise question at issue

18

and has arrived at a different conclusion.

19

QUESTION:

You began with a construction of the

20

statute, and I -- as I understand it, all that did for us

21

was to get us out of the conduct test.

decide whether or not your specificity test or what I

25

would call the preemption test of the petitioner is the

better of the two, and I don't think the statute helped us

2

much between those two alternatives, or am I --

3

MR. STEWART:

I think you're right.

I think we

4

are construing the phrase, made punishable.

We are

5

asking, what does it mean to say that a State law offense

6

has been made punishable by an act of Congress, and our

7

view is, it's been made punishable only if Congress has

8

spoken very precisely to the specific class of conduct

9

that constitutes the State offense.
But we would readily concede we don't

10

11

particularly draw that from the literal, necessary

12

significance of the words, made punishable.

13

instead from what we take to be the underlying premises of

14

the Assimilative Crime Act.

15

QUESTION:

We draw it

That is --

Is the result of your submission that

in most cases the harsher of the two sanctions will apply,

17

or is that not the way it's going to work most of the

18

time?

19

MR. STEWART:

I don't know how that will work.

20

Certainly the result of our solution will be that there

21

will be more cases in which the Federal prosecutor will

22

have a choice between two statutes, and I would suppose at

23

least in some of those cases the prosecutor will choose

24

the one that has the harsher penalty.

1

Mr. Stewart, your answer to Justice

2

Scalia pointed out quite rightly that concurrent

3

jurisdiction and -- I mean, concurrent -- subjection to

4

concurrent schemes of law is the norm now.

5

Is that a legitimate basis for us to consider in

6

construing this statute, because this statute was intended

7

to address the case in which there is a hiatus, shall

8

State law fill it, and now you're saying, well, we'll use

9

this statute to answer a different question.

There is, we

10

presume, a concurrence, and when is it illegitimate not to

11

recognize that concurrence, and that's a different kind of

12

question.
MR. STEWART:

13

I think it is a different kind of

14

question.

15

individuals are typically subject to concurrent State and

16

Federal law, obviously Congress could have adopted a

17

different regime for the enclaves if had chosen.

18

When I spoke of the background norm that

For one thing, Congress might have decided, for

19

instance, that the criminal law applicable to all the

20

Federal enclaves shall be the Criminal Code of the

21

District of Columbia, which in a sense is the

22

quintessential Federal enclave.

23

If Congress had placed preeminent importance on

24

maintaining uniformity among the enclaves, a solution like

25

that might have occurred to it.

1

I think the solution that it chose, assimilating

2

State law, reflects the premise that there was an

3

independent value in maintaining consistency between the

4

enclaves and the surrounding areas of the State, that an

5

enclave is in a meaningful respect part of the State in

6

which it's located.

7

QUESTION:

In practical effect, then, it would

8

give the prosecutor on the enclaves the kind of authority

9

that the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia has.

10

That is, to pick -- he could -- here, he could pick also

11

courts, but pick whether to indict under the D.C. Code or

12

under the U.S. Code.

13

MR. STEWART:

I think that's correct.

With --

14

again, with the reminder that because the prosecution

15

would be brought by a single sovereign, the double

16

jeopardy rules applicable to multiple punishments would

17

apply as they would to any claim of multiple punishments

18

by the Federal Government.

19

QUESTION:

The trouble with the -- I can see the

20

practical consequence being, well, so what, they just have

21

both jurisdictions.

22

On the other hand, this book of the Federal

23

Criminal Code didn't used to be, but now it's many times

24

bigger than most State codes, and so what I would fear

25

with your approach is, thousands of cases we're parsing

the words of -- differently written in State and Federal

2

statutes to try to figure out whether your analytic test

3

or your other test or both are or are not applicable.

4
5
6

MR. STEWART:

I think our test is actually

easier to administer than the competing test.
That is, it's certainly not going to be a

7

problem to compare the elements of a State offense to the

8

elements of the Federal offense that's alleged to be

9

preemptive and determine whether they are precisely the

10

11

same elements.
Now, it's true that the second step of our

12

inquiry will involve a certain amount of indeterminacy,

13

but again, our basic point is, the use of the Assimilative

14

Crimes Act should be precluded only when it is quite clear

15

that Congress has spoken to the precise question and that,

16

in the run of cases, is going to be an easier test to

17

administer than simply one that asks, is it close enough.

18

QUESTION:

19

Mr. Granger, you have 3 minutes remaining.

Thank you, Mr. Stewart.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK GRANGER

21

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

22

MR. GRANGER:

I think the question really is,

23

the Louisiana statute really is more a death penalty

24

statute than merely an attempt to particularly define

25

child killing, but I think -51

that.

So you're relying on the death

Did you do that in your brief?

4

MR. GRANGER:

5

QUESTION:

6

now.
(Laughter.)

8

MR. GRANGER:
QUESTION:

11

12

No, but I --

Can you tell me how you get that into

the language of the statute?
MR. GRANGER:

Because of the fact that you have

to bring the punishment along with the crime.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. GRANGER:

15

QUESTION:

16

Not -- no, sir, Your Honor.

But it seems like a good idea to you

7

10

I don't recall

Yes, but that isn't the criterion -Correct.

-- of whether the statute assimilates

the State law or not.

17

MR. GRANGER:

18

QUESTION:

I agree with you, Justice --

The criterion is act or omission.

Is

1

there any way to get punishment within the meaning of act

20

or omission?

21

MR. GRANGER:

No, I don't believe so, Justice --

22

QUESTION:

I didn't think so.

23

QUESTION:

Well, why don't -- isn't there a way

24

to get it in which is, you want to know whether Congress,

25

in passing these other laws, really intended to forego

1

picking up the Louisiana law, and I guess Congress would

2

look at what the difference is, wouldn't it?

3

MR. GRANGER:

I would think so, Justice Breyer.

4

Also, I think that if we look at 18 U.S.C. 3551

5

it also allows the bringing in, even though it may be an

6

assimilated State crime, you have to look at the

7

guideline.

8

QUESTION:

Which section is it again?

9

MR. GRANGER:

3551, Your Honor.

10

QUESTION:

Thank you.

11

QUESTION:

What does 3551 say?

12

MR. GRANGER:

Because -- what it does, Justice

13

Scalia, is that if you have an assimilated State crime,

14

you then have to look at the guideline that's most

15

analogous to that particular crime.

16

QUESTION:

Fine.

17

MR. GRANGER:

18

QUESTION:

And I think that --

Fine, but how does that relate to

19

Congress' intent that Justice Breyer is talking about?

20

Can you attach that congressional intent to some

21

enactment?

22

MR. GRANGER:

23

QUESTION:

I don't think I can.

Or is it just sort of a wandering

24

congressional intent unreflected in the United States

25

Code?

MR. GRANGER:

1

2

It may be the latter, Justice

Scalia.

3

QUESTION:

Okay.

4

QUESTION:

Well, it's an act or omission made

5

punishable, and I suppose it's a legitimate question to

6

say, well, made punishable how?

7

MR. GRANGER:

8

QUESTION:

Correct.

And as Justice Breyer suggested, when

you ask, made punishable how, by a lot, by a little, you
10

are, in fact, focusing ultimately on an issue of intent,

11

and I take it -- I mean, that's what you want us to do, I

12

take it.

13

MR. GRANGER:

Correct, but Justice Souter, more

14

importantly, I think what gives me pause is that the

15

argument of the Government then states that people are

16

subjected to two different jurisdictions.

17

Well, if you're on a Federal enclave, I don't

18

think you really are subjected to State law.

1

subjected to Federal law for a Federal crime on a Federal

20

enclave, so the inquiry is, and what it's always been when

21

we're dealing with these kind of cases is, has Congress

22

enacted a law that prescribes or punishes, makes

23

punishable this conduct?

24

look to State law.

and numerous military reservations all over, and then the

2

U.S. Attorney is going to be forced to say, well,

3

Louisiana defines it a little bit differently here, so I'm

4

going to use Louisiana law.

5

What happens to the Federal law?

Is it even

6

necessary any more?

7

in the 1940's, to reenact the Assimilative Crimes Act to
