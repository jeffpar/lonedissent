ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN SHOBAT

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SHOBAT:

12

13
14

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The ambiguous general verdicts returned in this

15

case cannot support the sentencing court's finding that

16

the conspiracy embraced both objectives charged in this

17

dual object conspiracy, the two objectives being the

18

distribution of powder cocaine and the distribution of

19

crack cocaine, and they cannot be for four reasons.

20

First, Congress required the jury to determine

21

the type of drug involved in the drug conspiracy before

22

sentence could be imposed upon that object.

23

Second, the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to

24

a jury determination of all the essential elements of a

25

conspiracy requires the jury to determine what the object

1

2

of the offense was, and particular to the type of drug.
Third, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth

3

Amendment does not permit punishment to be imposed in

4

excess of the statutory maximum provided by Congress and,

5

finally, nothing in the Sentencing Guidelines, to the

6

extent that they ever could, undermines these principles.

7

With respect to what Congress intended, it's

8

clear that in enacting section 846 Congress wanted to fix

9

the maximum punishment available to a person convicted of

10

that section to the offense, the object of which the

11

conspiracy was intending to accomplish.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Shobat, does your argument depend

13

on finding that both the type and the quantity of drugs

14

are elements of the section 846 conspiracy?

15

MR. SHOBAT:

No, Your Honor, it does not.

It's

16

clear that Congress, in listing the various different

17

factors in section 841(b), intended that some of them be

18

elements of the offense and some of them not be.

19

made it explicitly clear in enacting section 851 that the

20

existence of a prior conviction was one of the factors

21

listed in 841(b) that should not be considered by the

22

jury, and it did so by removing it from the jury's

23

consideration, placing it in a separate statutory

24

provision, and saying that the judge should make that

25

determination.

Where is that?
Section 851, Your Honor?

Section

851 -QUESTION:

You say by placing it in 851 rather

than as one of the subsections of 841, you say?
MR. SHOBAT:

Yes.

By removing it from the

subsection of 841(b) and placing it in a separate

10

statutory provision, and then having the judge, not the

11

jury, determine -- and interestingly, beyond a reasonable

12

doubt, whether the --

QUESTION:

I

don't think you do, do you?
MR. SHOBAT:

I'm -- I don't -- I'm not sure that

it is in the appendix, Your Honor.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. SHOBAT:

19

Do you have 851 in your appendix?

Okay.
But it did remove that

consideration from the jury.

20

What it did not remove were the type of drugs

21

and the quantity, but it is not necessary that those be

22

treated identically for purposes of an 846 conspiracy, and

23

there are several reasons for that.

24
25

First, Congress could well have intended that a
conspiracy to commit a specific objective, which is an

1

inchoate offense which does not require the completion of

2

the object of the conspiracy and has separate elements

3

from an 841(a) conspiracy to embrace a more specific

4

object than would, say, an ordinary 841(a)(1) violation of

5

possession, or a distribution.

6

In addition --

7

QUESTION:

8

9
10

said.

I don't understand what you just

Do you want to say it again?
MR. SHOBAT:

Yes, Your Honor.

A conspiracy offense under 846 is an inchoate

11

offense and therefore the only two elements that the

12

Government need satisfy beyond a reasonable doubt for an

13

846 offense is that a conspiracy with a particular

14

objective exists and that a particular defendant that was

15

being considered by the jury be a member of that

16

conspiracy.

17

In many conspiracies there are no actual drugs

18

involved, very typically, in the case in which the agents

19

pose as the sellers of drugs and they engage in

20

negotiations and discussions with respective buyers and

21

then a seizure or a bust takes place, an arrest at a

22

planned exchange of drugs for money, and there is, in fact

23

no actual controlled substance.

24
25

QUESTION:

In that case --

Well, surely there's an attempt to

buy a particular -- I mean, are these drug dealers that

stupid that they don't contract to buy a particular

2

substance?

3
4

MR. SHOBAT:

Not at all, Your

Honor.

5
6

Not at all.

QUESTION:
then, wouldn't it,

7

Well, that would be the conspiracy
in substance?

MR. SHOBAT:

Absolutely,

it would be a

8

conspiracy conviction, but now the question becomes, what

9

maximum penalty did Congress provide for that conspiracy,

10

and the answer to that question is, what was their

11

conspiratorial objective.
That's what Congress expressly says in section

12

13

846, punish persons who agree to commit a very specific

14

object as if they had committed that object, and in the

15

case of the type of drug, that specific -- excuse me.

16

the case of a distribution offense, that specific offense

17

is only knowable by reference to the specific type of

18

drug.

19
20

QUESTION:

In

But why not an amount as well, since

there's such a --

21

QUESTION:

Right.

22

QUESTION:

So much turns on amount.

Why does it

23

turn on the type of drug more or less than the amount of

24

the drug?

25

MR. SHOBAT:

Your Honor,

it can be and,

in fact,

1

it's not squarely raised in this case, but we would submit

2

that quantity could be considered an element by Congress.

3

Congress could have intended it to be an element, but it

4

isn't necessarily the case.

5

presented, we believe -QUESTION:

6

That question isn't squarely

You're saying, type of drug is an

7

element of the offense, but amount of drug is not an

8

element of the offense?
MR. SHOBAT:

9
10

definitively that it is not an element of the offense.
QUESTION:

argument?

Are you -- well, what is the

Is the argument -MR. SHOBAT:

The argument is that it might be an

element of the offence.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. SHOBAT:

17

QUESTION:

Well, I -We believe that it is.

However --

You believe that amount is as well?

18

So in other words, we have a big list in 841(b) of

19

penalties, and the penalties vary, sometimes dramatically,

20

depending upon the amount of the drug and depending upon

21

what kind of drug and, as you said recidivism, which is

22

treated specially.

23

All right.

24

find type and probably amount.

Now, your point is that jury has to

QUESTION:

1

2

The difficulty with doing that is,

why does it have to find it, because Congress intended it?

3

MR. SHOBAT:

4

QUESTION:

Because Congress intended it.
Why would Congress have intended the

5

following:

6

possessing with intent to distribute more than one -- more

7

than -- between 5 and 10 kilograms of heroin, let's say,

8

and the person's defense is, I wasn't there.
Chicago.

10
11

a person is accused, for example, of

Is he supposed to make the alternative defense,

oh, by the way, if I was there, it was only 1/2 a kilo?
I mean, why would we ask a jury to decide that

12

kind of thing?

13

that kind of position?

14

I was in

Why would we want to put a defendant in

MR. SHOBAT:

Your Honor, I suppose there are two

15

answers to that question.

16

becomes, what is the appropriate punishment for an

17

individual like that who had that agreement?

18

QUESTION:

The first is, the question

And that's why I would think that

1

841(b) includes punishment factors, and if it is supposed

20

to be punishment factors there's no problem for the

21

defendant, and if it's supposed to be punishment factors

22

in respect to amounts, I don't see how you could

23

distinguish why it shouldn't be punishment factors in

24

respect to type.

25

MR. SHOBAT:

One of the ways that we attempt to

(202)28 -2260
(800) FOR DEPO

1

distinguish it, Justice Breyer, is to note that as part of

2

the 841(a)(1) elements the jury is asked to conclude that

3

the substance being agreed to be distributed or

4

manufactured under an 841(a)(1) and 846 offense, the jury

5

is going down the road of determining and must determine

6

that the agreement impacted a controlled substance.

7
8

Now, not every substance is a controlled
substance, so the jury must make a decision, a finding,
that the particular substance contemplated in 846 was one

10
11

of the substances listed in section (a)(12).
QUESTION:

When you say finding you're not

12

talking about a special verdict, you're just talking about

13

a finding in its deliberative process that results in a

14

verdict of guilty.

15

MR. SHOBAT:

That's correct, Mm Chief Justice.

16

They are asking themselves, was there an agreement to

17

distribute a controlled substance?

18

To know that, that this is not salt or sugar,

1

they must come to the view that it's one of those

20

substances under (a)(12), at least that that was

21

contemplated in this conspiracy.

22

That means that the jury is already going down

23

that road in determining what the substance is.

24

that's distinguishable --

25

QUESTION:

We think

All the jury perhaps has to determine

1

is that it was a controlled substance, but not a specific

2

type or amount.

3

structure of the statutes, it seems to me.

4

I mean, that's possible under the

MR. SHOBAT:

That's possible Justice O'Connor,

5

but in concluding that it is a controlled substance, they

6

are concluding that it is one of the substances identified

7

in section (a) (12), which lists all the controlled

8

substances there can be, and so they're making that

9

finding.

10

They may not come out and say, we find it was

11

cocaine, or we find it was heroin, but they are saying we

12

find it was a controlled substance, and therefore --

13

QUESTION:

It means that there's been a

14

violation of the statute, and then perhaps the punishment

15

is up to the sentencing authority, the judge.

16

MR. SHOBAT:

We submit, Your Honor, that the

17

jury going down that road to make that finding, Congress

18

made clear that that's the kind of finding that the jury

19

should make, and that the jury must make, and not leave it

20

solely to the sentencing --

21

QUESTION:

But ordinarily a finding in terms of

22

the statute is perfectly sufficient, isn't it?

23

says, it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or

24

intentionally to manufacture, dispute or -- distribute or

25

possess a controlled substance.

Here 841

1

So isn't it

one would think that a verdict

2

that says, guilty of 841, or guilty of possessing or

3

conspiring to distribute a controlled substance, would be

4

sufficient for the guilt element.

5

MR. SHOBAT:

Mr. Chief Justice, we don't believe

6

that that is sufficient, that particularly in a case such

7

as this, where the Government charges not just any

8

controlled substance but a very specific controlled

9

substance, that --

10

QUESTION:

You think it would have been okay if

11

the Government just charged a controlled substance

12

generally and left itself free to prove any number of

13

other things?

14

MR. SHOBAT:

I think that it would be

15

permissible for the Government to have charged simply a

16

controlled substance, but I think it would have additional

17

problems of its own.

18

That is to say, I think there might be a case in

19

which it's not exactly clear whether which of the

20

controlled substances a particular defendant conspired to,

21

and in that case the Government might not want to commit

22

that it was particularly heroin, or a jury might be able

23

to conclude, well, I think it was heroin, or I believe

24

beyond a reasonable doubt it was heroin, I believe beyond

25

a reasonable doubt it was cocaine, I'm not sure whether it

3

Under the instructions that the judge

So that in this case, the jurors could have

4

decided that these individuals conspired to distribute

5

crack cocaine, or they might have decided that they

6

distributed powder cocaine.

7

QUESTION:

Well, regardless, wouldn't evidence,

8

if there was such, showing there was some involvement with

9

cocaine base, be factored in as relevant conduct under the

10

guidelines?
I don't see how the sentences would change in

11

12

13

any event.
MR. SHOBAT:

Justice O'Connor, they would change

14

in the -- for a number of significant reasons.

15

all, the statutory penalty is not based on a consideration

16

of the guidelines or relevant conduct, but it's based on

17

what was the agreement, what was the offense of

18

conviction, so that if the offense of conviction were --

19
20
21

QUESTION:

First of

Well, the offense was a conspiracy to

possess and/or distribute a controlled substance.
MR. SHOBAT:

That's not the offense that was

22

charged in this case, and we would submit that to know

23

what the statutory maximum penalty is, that there needs to

24

be a determination as to the type of drug.

25

After all, the differential in the punishment

1

between the two objects was 100 to 1.

2

cocaine is treated equivalently under the guidelines --

3

excuse me, under the statutory penalty as the same as

4

1 gram of crack cocaine, and that was why the particular

5

problem that arises in this case is especially important,

6

depending on which objective --

7

QUESTION:

100 grams of powder

What was the difference in the

8

maximum sentence that could be imposed under the one or

9

under the other?

10

MR. SHOBAT:

That's a very difficult question to

11

answer, Justice Scalia, because the indictment in this

12

case charged no specific threshold quantity in terms of

13

giving us notice as to the particular drug.

14

Under the indictment -- the Government suggests

15

in its brief that we should just simply look at the

16

indictment and look at the statute, and that's how we know

17

our maximum penalty.

18

If that's in fact the standard, looking at this

19

indictment, in which there's no specific quantity or

20

threshold quantity even alleged, no reference to any

21

subsection under 841(b), the maximum penalty is 20 years

22

for that type of offense and when there's a schedule 1 or

23

schedule 2 narcotic involved, so the maximum penalty would

24

be 20 years.

25

But what happened in this case is that at

1

sentencing the judge made some findings with regard to a

2

different sort of conspiracy, that is, one which embraced

3

both the crack cocaine and the powder cocaine, made

4

specific findings about exact amounts, of type of drug,

5

and quantity, and determined that with respect to some of

6

the petitioners the maximum was life imprisonment, but

7

with respect to other petitioners the maximum was 40

8

years.
QUESTION:

9

So what you're saying is, if it was

10

powder cocaine it was -- the maximum was 20, and if it was

11

crack, the maximum was 100?
MR. SHOBAT:

12

Well, if it was crack the maximum

13

would also be 20 if the sole basis for determining the

14

maximum punishment is to look at the indictment and to

15

read the statute.
That's what the Government says you should do,

16
17

but in reality, what the district court did was not simply

18

look at the indictment.

19

quantity determinations are mine to make, and so once I

20

make these quantity determinations, that alters the

21

maximum penalties.
QUESTION:

22

What the district court said is,

Well, of course, I guess conspiracy

23

is a completed offense even before the drugs are actually

24

purchased.

25

are apprehended before they effected the buy.

Suppose the conspiracy is -- the conspirators

How does

1

the judge determine the sentence in that case?
MR. SHOBAT:

2

What the judge must do in that case

3

is first determine what the statutory penalty is.

4

first must say to itself, what was the offense of

5

conviction, and once it determines that -- let's say there

6

were negotiations, recorded conversations, and it appeared

7

that the person was trying to acquire 5 kilograms of

8

crack.

QUESTION:

It

My hypothetical is, they're not sure.

10

They want to just acquire some -- how much do you have? --

11

and then they're apprehended.

12

MR. SHOBAT:

In that case, the only way that a

13

sentencing judge could determine what the maximum penalty

14

would be, first under the statute is to make a finding as

15

to what the amount was, or at least what the threshold

16

amount was.

That is, was it more than 50 --

The same thing.

If you don't know,

you assume it's the one that's punished the least
severely.
QUESTION:

Is your argument -- it can't be

conspired to distribute, to possess with intent to

4

distribute cocaine, and they also conspired with intent --

possessed with intent to distribute cocaine base -- crack.

6

There's 26 very specific paragraphs, and it says that

violated 846 and 84 .

20

So the person, to get the penalty, would look up
846 and look up 84 , and he'll see the big list, and
there's a big list of maximums.

21

There's nothing wrong with that, is there?

22

MR. SHOBAT:

Well, there's nothing wrong with

that if he knows what the threshold quantity is.

QUESTION:

I don't believe -All right.

Then I'm not sure what

your argument -MR. SHOBAT:

8

Am I

-- that you're exactly correct,

because in this statute, under this specific statute the

10

statutory maximum changes based on not only the type of

drug but the threshold quantity of drugs involved in the

sentencing factor.

Am I right?

MR. SHOBAT:

That the possible -- generally most

of them fall within a statutory maximum.
QUESTION:

But sometimes Congress passes a

statute -- drugs, immigration -- you know, where they say,

if you've done X in committing the crime, the maximum goes

from 2 years to 20 years, or from -- so you're complaining

about all those, is that right, or is there something

don't know is what the offense of conviction was.

We don't know whether this jury determined --

that this was a powder cocaine conspiracy, a crack cocaine

correct that if you draw this distinction between type of

2

the two drugs that would support the sentences, or the

ranges within which he's sentenced?

I think that the answer to that

question is yes, that it would necessarily affect some of

the petitioners.

Each of the five petitioners --

MR. SHOBAT:

Some but not all, and it would

Remember that the sentencing judge utilized the

everybody is held accountable for.

14

offensive conviction embraced both objectives, his

findings as to what was relevant conduct or what amounts

MR. SHOBAT:

There was no objection to that.

It's our position, however, Your Honor, that

since the Government brought the dual object conspiracy,

You're not complaining about the

we would complain about what the jury determine -- excuse

verdict, nonetheless a sentencing judge could have taken

2

into consideration a wide number of things in deciding

3

what to sentence your clients to, a prior offense, prior

4

indictment, prior conduct?

5

MR. SHOBAT:

Under the Sentencing Guidelines

6

that's absolutely correct.

That is -- that -- it would

7

not be true, however, in fixing the statutory penalty, but

8

we acknowledge that under this Court's decision in Witte

9

and Watts, that the juge is free to consider a wide range

10

and not just simply say, well, I thought about it, but

11

actually to make the findings required under the

12

Sentencing Guidelines -- but that is, again, a guideline

3
4

determination.
In this case, there were no statutory maximum

5

penalty determinations made. What the judge did is just do

6

the guideline analysis and then say, based on these

7

guideline results, I'm now determining what the stacutory

8

maximum was.

QUESTION:

If that changes -- in another case

20

we've been involved in this, but the -- if that changes,

21

because it's not just guideline but also statutory add­

ons -- let's call them sentencing factors.

do you do with the earlier Supreme Court cases, McMillian

2

and so forth, that we've been looking into, which say that

3

where you have a sentencing factor such as possession of a

4

gun, which increases the maximum penalty, that can be a

5

determination to be made by a judge.

6

charged in the indictment, and it needn't -- in fact, in

7

McMillian I think we found beyond a reasonable doubt.
So how do you deal with those cases and also win

8

9

It needn't be

your case?

10

MR. SHOBAT:

11

Your Honor because --

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. SHOBAT:

McMillan supports our position,

Because?
-- in McMillan there was no

14

increase in the statutory maximum penalty.

15

increase was in a mandatory minimum so that the visible

16

possession of a firearm in McMillan caused there to be a

17

minimum of 5 years imposed but did not in any way increase

18

the statutory maximum.

19

QUESTION:

Why isn't that worse?

The only

Why aren't

20

mandatory minimum penalties from a defendant's point of

21

view actually a lot worse than an increase in the maximum?

22

MR. SHOBAT:

We think that they're bad, but the

23

reason they're not worse in part, I think, lies in the

24

power of a sentencing judge to grant an upward departure.

25

The statutory maximum provides protection to a
23

1

defendant to prevent a sentencing court from going beyond

2

the statutory maximum.

3

reason to grant an upward departure, for example, with

4

respect to petitioners Joiner or Edwards, who received a

5

10-year sentence, they might have gotten a 20-year

6

sentence if that were the statutory maximum for them.

7

In this case, had there been a

If they had been considered to have the same

8

statutory maximum as petitioner Fort, who had a life

9

maximum, then it would be very significant to know that,

10

even if there was an upward departure granted in this

11

case, it would not exceed 20 years and risk, you know,

12

possibly a life sentence.

13

And so under McMillan, the reason -- one of the

14

reasons we say that this is an essential element of the

15

offense is because it not only alters the range, but it

16

alters the statutory maximum penalty.

17

Mr. Chief Justice --

18

QUESTION:

Are you saying that a special verdict

19

would have been compatible with your view of this case?

20

That is, the judge says, jury, the Government has charged

21

both powdered cocaine and crack cocaine, and so I want you

22

to find specially as to each.

23

MR. SHOBAT:

24

QUESTION:

25

That would be all right.

Yes, Your Honor.

ordinarily like special verdicts.

MR. SHOBAT:

The jury could have been instructed

2

as it was that you could find either-or, but then, in

addition, the jury should have been asked which do you

4

find, either powder, crack, or perhaps both.

MR. SHOBAT:

9

And ask that in a special verdict?
Yes, and then there would be a jury

QUESTION:

Yes.

Does it follow from what you've

been telling us that it would be perfectly proper under

10

your theory for the Government to charge two separate

11

conspiracies, one for powdered cocaine, the other for

12

crack, and then for the punishments to be consecutive?

13

MR. SHOBAT:

It -- yes, Your Honor.

It is the

14

logic of our position that the Government is free to do

15

that and, in fact, they are doing that every day with

16

respect to distributions.

17

In fact, the Government in response to defense

18

arguments that you can't do that, that violates double

19

jeopardy, crack and cocaine are the same thing, the

20

Government has said no, crack cocaine and powered cocaine

21

are different substances.

consecutively, or cumulatively, and now in this case the

Government is saying, oh, no, it's really just a

controlled substance.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD C. DUMONT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

9
10

We

MR. DUMONT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

There is one issue that's rather straightforward

12

that is genuinely presented on the facts of this case and,

13

if I may, I'd like to address that just for a moment

14

first.

15

Some of the courts of appeals have held that

16

when a drug conspiracy verdict does not reveal exactly

17

what drug the jury may have concluded was involved, or

18

more than one drug, that under the guidelines the court is

19

limited to sentencing only on the basis of the drug that

20

will produce the lower penalty.
QUESTION:

21

22

23
24
25

Under the guidelines, or under the

statute?
MR. DUMONT:

Under the guidelines.

There are at

least three -QUESTION:

How can the guidelines control what

1

statutory maximum is available?

2

MR. DUMONT:

I don't understand that.

In our view they don't control that

3

at all, but three of the courts of appeals have held that

4

even if you're talking about a case where the statutory

5

maximum and minimum are clear, that in terms of applying

6

the guidelines the district court at sentencing must

7

apply -- must take into account only the drug that will

8

produce the lower guidelines sentence.
QUESTION:

9

But the statutory maximum and minimum

10

cannot be clear if you don't know what the substance is,

11

can they?

12

MR. DUMONT:

I'm not sure that's true now,

13

because you could have a couple of possibilities, both of

14

which would put you into, say, the minimum category, the

15

zero to 20 category, but one of which would put you at 19

16

years under the guidelines, and one of which would put you

17

at 5 years, so it can make quite a difference.

18

QUESTION:

But they wouldn't be similarly

19

inconsequential as far as the guidelines are concerned,

20

they're only inconsequential as to the statutory grades?

21

MR. DUMONT:

22

QUESTION:

Well, my only point is -I mean, would the guidelines treat

23

differently two substances that are treated the same in

24

the statute?

25

MR. DUMONT:

The guidelines are much more

1

specific about what -- how you do the quantity

2

calculations and how you take things into account, but my

3

point is only that even in cases where there is no

4

controversy about what the statutory range is, the

5

guidelines range can differ quite a bit, depending on

6

whether you take into account some crack or don't take

7

into account some crack.

8

And some of the courts of appeals have, in fact,
held that in a case like this, if you accepted the verdict

10

was ambiguous, the judge would be limited to taking into

11

account only the powdered cocaine that was involved.

12

Now, we think that those cases are -- that issue

13

is presented here on the facts of this case, because it

14

would make a big difference to these petitioners whether

15

they are sentenced for powder or for crack, but we think

16

that those cases that would limit the court to powder

17

under the guidelines are flatly inconsistent with this

18

Court's sentencing jurisprudence, most recently,

1

obviously, the decision last term in Watts and the Court's

20

decision in Witte.

21

We know from Watts that even if they had been

22

charged, as petitioners say they could have been, with two

23

separate conspiracies and the jury had acquitted on the

24

crack conduct, that the crack cocaine could have been

25

taken into account at sentencing by the judge, and it

cannot be true that that is permissible but then it's not

2

permissible to do so here, where -QUESTION:

3
4

The commission could deal with that

as it wishes, couldn't it?
I mean, if the commission said, look, what we

5
6

think you have to do is sentence the person to 10 years if

7

he has 5 grams of crack, and you have to sentence him to 2

8

years if it's 5 grams of cocaine, and you, the sentencing

9

judge, are to take as a -- an assumption of what the

10

amounts are that which is found by the jury and if there

11

is no jury finding you will assume, blah, blah, blah.
They could write a guideline like that, couldn't

12

13

they?

14

MR. DUMONT:

15

QUESTION:

Well -And if they don't like the way the

16

judges are doing it, they can write the opposite

guideline.

about whether the commission would have power to do

anything that would seem to trench on what this Court said

in Watts and required by --

If the courts feel they are being

acquiescence in this case, there is no indication -- the

21

It's

Now, it is true, as petitioners argue, that

22

statutory maxima and minima trump whatever is in the

setting the statutory minimum and maximum.

Now, the short answer, as we pointed out in our

1

2

brief, in this case is no effect, because if you

3

calculate -- and we did do the math, and it's been --

4

petitioners have not demonstrated that there's anything

5

wrong with our math -- that if you calculate the statutory

6

ranges in this case based purely on the district judge's

7

powder cocaine findings, you will find that the sentences

8

actually imposed in every case fall within permissible

9

statutory range, so our submission would be there's no

10

issue on the facts of this case under the statute.

11

But should the Court wish to proceed and

12

consider that issue, we think it's plain from the

13

structure and language of the relevant statutes here,

14

sections 846 and 841, that the answer to that is that

15

these are sentencing factors for the trial judge.
Now, section 846, which is on pages 1 and 2 of

16
17

the appendix in the blue brief, says any person who

18

attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in

19

this sub-chapter shall be subject to the same penalties,

20

and so on.

21

The offenses are defined by the other sections

22

in that portion of the United States Code.

23

look at 841, which is the object defense here, 841(a)

24

defines the offense, and the offense is either possession

MR. DUMONT:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. DUMONT:

We disagree about that.
That's fine.
We disagree about that, obviously,

14

and our analysis is that 841(a) defines an offense which

15

is complete once the jury finds that you have distributed

16

or manufactured or possessed with the intent a controlled

17

substance, and it's true they -- in a substantive count,

18

then in the nature of things they will have to find a

19

controlled substance involved.
I would point out, as came out from some of the

20
21

questions, in a conspiracy offense that's not at all

22

clear.

23

could be charged and which you could be found guilty where

24

you would have no idea what the type of substance involved

25

was.

There are certainly conspiracies for which you

Now, I grant you, that will give rise, in those

1

cases, if they actually happen, to strange sentencing

3

issues under both 841(b) and under the guidelines, because

4

it's not clear what you do with something where you really

don't know even what type of drug was involved, but the

fact is the conviction would --

QUESTION:

You apply the minimum.

I think

8

that's an easy answer, isn't it?

It's up to the

9

Government to prove whatever is necessary to prove in

10

order to impose a penalty and if you can't figure out what

11

it was, the most you can impose is the minimum, I would

12

assume.

What's hard about that?

13
14

MR. DUMONT:

That's a potential answer to that

question.

15

QUESTION:

It seems to me it's the only answer.

16

The burden's on the Government to establish what needs to

17

be established to impose the penalty, isn't it?

18

MR. DUMONT:

Well, for present purposes my point

19

would be, we would establish that at sentencing to the

20

judge, and the conviction would be valid.
Even if it were true that we could not impose a

21

22

term of imprisonment, the conviction, the special

23

assessment and the record and so on would reflect a

24

conviction for a felony, and that felony would be defined

25

by 841(a).

It would have nothing to do with 841(b).

841(b) has to do with prescribing the penalties

that are appropriate under particular circumstances for

violations of 841 (a) .

4

QUESTION:

And if you commit the offense of

5

conspiracy you perhaps under one view would simply be

6

subject to the risk of being sentenced based on what the

7

conspiracy turned up and the judge says, it's 5 grams, or

8

10 grams, or whatever.

9

MR. DUMONT:

That's absolutely right, and our

10

point here is, when you move into the realm of

11

conspiracy -- now, 846 obviously covers a wide range of

12

different target statutes and so on, and in this

13

particular case we're dealing with 846, referring to 841

14

as the object statute.

15

We think it's fairly clear that what Congress

16

would have intended here is when you are convicted of

17

conspiracy to violate 841 what happens is the judge at

18

sentencing looks at the complex of offense conduct

19

involved in that conspiracy under very traditional

Pinkerton-type conspiracy vicarious --

QUESTION:

May I interrupt with just one

22

question to be sure -- what if, in this case, instead of a

a whole stream of different alternatives, and the jury

found not guilty as to 9 out of the 10, but on one they

MR. DUMONT:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. DUMONT:

The judge could

Well -With specific findings.
I would say particularly in the

12

conspiracy context -- in the conspiracy context, the

13

answer is clearly yes, because as long as the conviction

14

is valid, everything else is a sentencing factor and, as

15

the court pointed out in Watts, the difference in standard

16

of proof makes a huge difference there, because all the

17

jury has said by declining to convict on the other counts

18

is they weren't convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, but

19

there's a big range there between that and preponderance

20

of the evidence where the court can operate.

21

Now, what I will say is, it's a harder case if

22

you have a substantive -- a set of substantive

23

distribution counts and the jury acquits on several but

24

convicts on only one, because in that case there's a -- I

25

think a substantial statutory interpretation question that

arises about what 841(b) means when it says, in the case

2

of a violation of subsection (a), involving.

3

Now, the circuits are split on that issue and

4

it's certainly not presented here, but it would not be

5

unreasonable for a court to hold, and several courts of

6

appeals have taken this route, that in a substantive

7

distribution case you are limited in terms of your

8

statutory maximum by the offense conduct that would be

9

dealt with in that one substantive distribution count.
QUESTION:

11
12

That's not the Government's view, is

it?
MR. DUMONT:

We haven't taken a position in this

13

Court on that question, and I hesitate to concede it in

14

this case because it's not presented, but it would

15

certainly be a plausible -- a plausible statutory outcome.

16

The Tenth Circuit has gone the other way on that

17

question and has said that no, all of these things are

18

sentencing factors to be dealt with by the judge, even

19

under the statute.

20

I think -- so we think that -- just to refer

21

back to that language that I was just quoting, again, if

22

we're talking about what is an element here and what is a

23

sentencing factor, we think that the language of 841 is

24

pretty clear on that.

appeals that have held that you need to be limited by the

2

offense of conviction have said well, of course, in a

3

conspiracy case, when you're talking about defining what

4

was involved in the offense of conviction for 841(b)

5

purposes you pick up Pinkerton principles, and principles

6

of vicarious liability.

7

So that ends up being either indistinguishable

8

from or very, very close to the relevant conduct inquiry

9

under the guidelines, so in a conspiracy case we really

10

think there is no substantial issue about that, that your

statutory maximum and minimum are going to set by the same

process as your guidelines sentence, and there's really

nothing wrong with that.

QUESTION:

7

MR. DUMONT:

Yes.
And one thing I would point out

8

about that is, when Congress enacted the current form of

841(b) in 1986, what it had in mind was setting three

10

broad categories, which were king pin distributors,

11

serious street level distributors, and then regular

12

distributors.

13

And we think it would be odd if what Congress

14

accomplished through all of this was to say that in a

conspiracy case, where every normal principle of

construction tells us that when you're found guilty of the

conspiracy you are then liable for all the conduct

involving the conspiracy, it would be a passing odd result

to find that when you apply that under the statutory

source of a lot of confusion in the briefs and I think,

That's just not the way it works.

The other thing is, the offense of conviction,

which we talk about both in terms of 841 as a statute --

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

Just before you go on,

5

that's quite correct unless you accept your colleague's

6

view of what 846 requires.

7

that 846 does require you to charge something other than

8

an intent to distribute some controlled substance, and if

9

you acknowledged his view that it requires you to specify

I mean, if you acknowledge

10

a controlled substance, then it would be a dual object,

11

under his view of the world.

12

MR. DUMONT:

Under his view of the world I think

13

that's right, and there would be -- there would be more

14

serious problems than figuring out the sentence, frankly,

15

because I think there would be problems with convictions,

16

although they've never stood up to the plate on that one.

17

Again, in view of the offense of conviction,

18

which is important, is a conspiracy to distribute

19

controlled substances, and I think if we look, as my

20

colleague was suggesting, at the indictment and at the

21

statute, he said, well, if you didn't specify quantity,

22

the maximum statutory sentence would be 20 years, and we

23

would quite strongly disagree with that.

participating in a drug conspiracy and no quantity is

MR. DUMONT:

They absolutely do, Your Honor.

It is not true that you somehow know from that
indictment that your exposure is limited to 20 years.
So I might just return to the fact that there is

13

one real and straightforward issue in this case, and the

14

other -- and that is the guidelines issue that I was

15

dealing with earlier, and the circuits are in conflict on

that issue, and the Court ought to resolve it in the way

that we think is plainly correct under Watts and Witte.

The other questions we've been considering are

very interesting, and they may, in fact, be difficult in

some future case that presents them, but this case, when

we return to our sheet, is really a very simple one, and

the judgment below ought to be affirmed.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN SHOBAT

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

3

MR. SHOBAT:

Mr. Chief Justice, the issue that

4

is not before the Court is the guideline issue.

Quite

5

frankly, this case doesn't raise the concerns of the

6

guidelines.

7

maximum and the offense of conviction, and that's the

8

starting point.

It raises the question of the statutory

9

Even before the district court could proceed to

10

the question of the Sentencing Guidelines, it had to know

11

what the offense of conviction was, and it had to know

12

what the statutory maximums --

QUESTION:

Well, were all these sentences within

the range of the powered cocaine range?

MR. SHOBAT:

QUESTION:

17

MR. SHOBAT:

18

it's very likely that it is no.

19

QUESTION:

The answer to that question is no.
No?
It's really, we don't know, but

The Government says it's calculated

20

them all and the answer is yes.

21

MR. SHOBAT:

Well, what the Government has

22

relied upon, Your Honor, is the findings of the Court

23

after having considered the defendants of being -- of

24

having been convicted of a conspiracy that we don't know

25

that they were convicted of, and so now, after the fact,

we have a determination by the sentencing court.

2

If the judge were to look at this anew and say

3

the conspiracy of which they were convicted was powdered

4

cocaine distribution, then the Court might say, well, I

5

think the amount of powdered cocaine is less than I

6

previously attributed to this conspiracy because then I

7

thought the conspiracy embraced both crack cocaine and

8

powder cocaine.

9

After all, in this conspiracy there were

10

quantities of powder cocaine that were converted into

11

crack cocaine and, for example, with respect to petitioner

12

Wintersmith, he was held accountable for 540 grams of

13

powder cocaine.

14

attributable to the crack conspiracy -- that is, that part

15

of the conspiracy that had to do with converting the

16

powder to crack and selling it out of a drug house -- just

17

diminution of that 40 grams would mean that his maximum

18

penalty was 20 years.

19

If just 40 grams of that substance were

Now, he received a sentence of 21 years, less

20

than the 40-year maximum that would have been applied at a

21

500-gram level, and so we think that the similar analysis

22

applies to each of the petitioners in varying degrees.

23

Certainly with regard to some of the petitioners

24

there was more evidence, there was a greater involvement

25

in the conspiracy, and that is the central problem with
