ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Since 1965, the National Endowment for the Arts

12

has selectively provided funding, public funding to arts

13

projects on the basis of aesthetic judgments in order to

14

enrich the lives of all Americans and to expand public

15

appreciation of art.

16

The question presented in this case is whether,

17

although it thus expands the opportunities for artistic

18

expression, Congress violated the First Amendment -- that

19

is, made a law abridging the freedom of speech -- by

20

directing that the NEA ensure, quote, that artistic

21

excellence and artistic merit are the standards by which

22

applications are judged, taking into consideration general

23

standards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs

24

and values of the American public.

25

Do you think this case is

I'm dealing with the question in the

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Justice Kennedy, I think that

15

the question of Article III justiciability, which of

16

course must be measured at the time the suit was commenced

17

or, really, in this case at the time that the pre-1990

18

claims were settled and all that was left in the case was

19

the facial challenge to the 1990 act, is a close one.

20

In the district court we challenged Article III,

21

the Article III justiciability issue both on the question

22

that these plaintiffs lacked standing and also because,

23

since the agency had adopted an interpretation that

24

basically concluded that the 1990 language was satisfied

25

merely by the creation of extremely diverse panels and

1

that decency and respect were not expressly to be

2

considered as independent factors at the grant-making

3

stage, the agency was in the process.

4

Process was in effect no different than it had

5

been before, other than the fact that the diversity of the

6

panels was greater, and therefore our view was that the

7

agency was not doing anything significantly different

8

after the district court ruled than before it ruled, and

9

conversely, if this Court were to agree with our statutory

10

interpretation, the agency would be permitted, although

11

not compelled, to continue to operate the program

12

precisely the way it's operating now.

13

Now, this was not an issue that we raised on

14

appeal or we raised in our petition in this Court, and I

15

wish I could tell you exactly why that's the case, because

16

I wasn't there, but I suspect that we concluded that there

17

was some marginal concreteness, or some marginal

18

justiciability here by the fact that before -- between the

19

time that the 1990 amendment was passed in November of '90

20

and the time that the district court issues, issued its

21

injunction in June of 1992, we actually read to the panel

22

members the language of the statute.

23

We then told them that they were to judge

24

applications on the basis of artistic merit and artistic

25

excellence, and that the other words, the words that

follow taking into consideration, had been taken into

2

consideration by the creation of extremely diverse panels

3

in which each person from a diverse walk of life would

4

bring his or her own individual sensibilities to that

5

question, and we argued to the district court that, in

6

fact, the case was not justiciability.

injury and there was no redressability possible.

8

9

There was no

In fact, during the period between the time that
the 1990 amendments were passed and the district court

10

ruled, three of the five plaintiffs in this case received

11

grants under the standard that they had concluded was

12

unconstitutional and a fourth had benefited indirectly

13

from a grant given to an organization.

14

QUESTION:

General Waxman, let me see if I

15

understand you.

I gather that you have no doubts on the

16

Article III question if your interpretation of the statute

17

is not correct - -

18

GENERAL WAXMAN:

19

QUESTION:

That is correct.

-- in this facial challenge.

The

20

statute which says, taking into account, requires that in

21

passing upon the applications the panels, diverse though

22

they may be, must take into account decency and the --

23

25

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Respect for the diverse beliefs

and values of the American people.
QUESTION:

-- beliefs and values, right, okay.

Yes.

decency?

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Well, the chairperson has the

5

discretion to create the pro -- the selection procedures

6

any way she or he wants, so long as he is satisfied or

ensured that general standards of decency will be taken

into account in the process.

QUESTION:

How do you take into account

standards of decency in selecting the panel?

3

GENERAL WAXMAN:

QUESTION:

5

GENERAL WAXMAN:

In -- no.

I don't understand how you do that.
In the process of deciding

6

which proposals will be granted on the basis of merit and

7

excellence, and here's how the NEA has construed the

8

statute to work.

9

The NEA Chair thus far has concluded that

10

whatever factors an individual takes into consideration in

11

deciding whether something is art, nonethe -- not to

12

mention artistically excellent and artistically merit,

13

meritorious, may be considerations of the mode and form of

14

expression in the case.

15

It's not dispositive, but if it includes a mode

16

or form of communication, the kind of thing that this

17

Court distinguished from viewpoint in Denver Area, and

18

Pacifica, and Pico, and Bethel, that it - - the NEA

19

concluded that many, if not most, if not all, certainly at

20

least some people in deciding whether something is really

21

artistically excellent or meritorious or how much it is,

22

will at least think about the mode or form of the

23

presentation that the artist is using, and that's --

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, quite apart from the -- what

the NEA has done, I've got some difficulties about the

the street and make a facial challenge to a statute,

They have to have some connection with what's being

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Absolutely, and what's so - - I

8

don't want to use a pejorative adjective.

9

unusual about this case is that the plaintiffs in the

10

case, who were very successful in forcing Congress to

11

reject what was the alternative to this amendment, the

12

Rohrabacher provision that would have prohibited the NEA

13

from funding any art that manifested certain viewpoints,

14

and Congress instead passed a compromise provision along

15

the lines of the recommendations of the independent

16

commission that it had appointed,

17

the same plaintiffs who were successful in the legislature

18

in defeating a viewpoint - discriminatory prohibition, have

19

challenged this provision on the grounds that our

20

interpretation, the way that the NEA has chosen to

21

interpret the statute is wrong, although it's wrong in a

22

way that benefits them.

23

QUESTION:

2

What's - - right.

What's

3

unusual in this case is that the courts have - - are being

asked to reject an interpretation, an application of the

5

statute that the agency has reasonably made and which does

not, concededly does not violate the First Amendment

7

rights.

10

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Waxman, could we talk about

the statutory language?
You know, just reading it, I thought it meant

11

that the chairperson of the NEA had to ensure that its - -

12

that the regulations and procedures were to provide that

13

artistic excellence and artistic merit are the criteria,

14

but in considering the excellence and merit, they have to

15

take into consideration general standards of decency and

16

respect for diversity.

17

That the interpretation suggested by the agency

18

that just setting up the panels differently was enough

19

strikes me as possibly in conflict with the language of

20

the statute.

21

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Well, Justice O'Connor, both

22

lower courts agreed with you.

23

are two possibly --

QUESTION:

statute, do we nonetheless have a justiciability question,

1

or do you think - -

2

GENERAL WAXMAN:

3

QUESTION:

4

--

I -if that's the meaning of the

statute we don't have a problem of justiciability?
GENERAL WAXMAN:

5

I'm not sure.

I know that the

6

plaintiffs would claim that insofar as any decisionmaker

7

along the line, whether it be a panel member, a council

8

member, or the chair, takes into consideration these two

9

factors, they believe that they are harmed in some way.

10

We don't think that they have demonstrated in

11

any tangible way that they have established injury, in the

12

sense that none of them suggests that they have applied

13

for an application and been denied it because an

14

impermissible reading of these -- a viewpoint -

15

discriminatory reading of these words caused it.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Well, do they have to have suffered a

denial?
I mean, their claim is that the statute on its

19

face, if read as Justice O'Connor suggested, in effect is

20

a limitation based on viewpoint which tends to and

21

reasonably will tend to affect both the production of art

22

and the applications, so that even before you get to the

23

stage of granting or denying, you in fact will have had an

24

impermissible effect.

25

Isn't that their argument?

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Well, I guess if we're talking

1

now simply about justiciability and not the merits, and

2

I'll restrict my comments accordingly, first of all,

3

because of the way the agency has interpreted this statute

4

before it was very shortly enjoined from doing it at all,

5

it hasn't had the occasion to define the terms general

6

standard of decency and respect for diverse values.

7

But the way in which -- if this Court were to

8

conclude that the statutory interpretation that the NEA

9

adopted was not only the best -- not the best

10

interpretation, but was an unreasonable interpretation by

11

the agency charged with carrying it out, the appropriate

12

course at this point would be to allow the agency to

13

define the terms and -- in order to determine whether or

14

not they are in fact viewpoint discriminatory at all.

15

contend in our brief - -

16

QUESTION:

We

Now, are you suggesting that we would

17

find it nonjusticiable because they have not gone through

18

the process of defining --

19

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Not because they haven't -- not

20

because they haven't gone through the process, and again

21

this falls a little bit into the merits, but I think the

22

justiciability is very much in question, because these

23

terms, general standards of decency and respect for

24

diverse beliefs and values, can be defined by the agency,

25

could readily be defined by the agency in a manner that is

Are you saying, General Waxman, that

7

more strictly against us than you're willing to do?

8

that the essence of your justiciability --

GENERAL WAXMAN:

that's the

10

essence of why we think, if our reading is right, there

probably is not much of an Article III case or

saying is, what's on today could be off tomorrow, and

3

that's their real concern, because you're not saying that

4

the only construction of these words is the one that

5

you're putting on it.

6

GENERAL WAXMAN:

No,

that's -- we're absolutely

7

not, but I think the appropriate course for this Court to

8

take if it rejects -- if it concluded that our statutory

9

interpretation was unreasonable would be to permit the

10

agency -- after all, none of these people have grants that

11

have -- this is not an as-applied challenge.

12

The appropriate course would be to permit the

3

agency to define and apply general standards of decency

and respect and see whether it's done in a way that could

5

be said to violate the First Amendment at all.

MR. COLE:

best further the educational purpose of the university,

where it can make viewpoint decisions, as in Rust, and

Why is that an important distinction?

11

that's an important distinction because there's a very big

12

difference between the Government participating in the

In Plain Dealer -- in that case, the Court held

that there was standing to bring a facial challenge by a

newspaper who sought access to a benefit for speech,

access to news boxes.

6

There was no requirement that the city give out

7

news boxes, but they had given a Government official

unbridled discretion in how to give them out, and the

Court held in that case that the chill from unbridled

12

alleviated only through a facial challenge.

MR. COLE:

1

Well, it hurts us for the following

2

reason, Justice Scalia.

The Government has been quite

3

ambiguous about its statutory construction, and what it

4

has said is that the statutory construction it is

5

advancing to this Court today is the same statutory

6

construction that they applied for the year-and-a-half

7

before the statute was declared unconstitutional, so let's

8

look at what they did for the year-and-a-half before the

9

Court struck it down.
They instructed each panelist to bring their own

11

standards of decency to the table in making these

decisions.

this was.

I take it there would be some dispute about what
went on.

1

The Government -- you're making

assertions today.

out what the Government's position is on it, but I thought

we're dealing with a ruling as a matter of law and that we

take the Government's position of what they say this

statute means.

7

I would certainly be interested to find

That's what they say the statute means, and

that's what they're enforcing.

That's what they

9

represented to this Court, and to say no, they're not

10

telling you the truth about what standard they're applying

is quite a charge to make.
MR. COLE:

Well, Your Honor, all I can say is

the record is very clear.

summary judgment is that there was no dispute about this.

The reason that it was a

The -- Chairman Frohnmayer testified before

Justice Rehnquist, he was the Chair at the time that the

statute was being enforced.
He as then asked, well, what would you do -- are

10
11

you advocating your responsibility in applying this

12

statute?

13

and it was indecent or disrespectful?

14

What would you do if something came up to you

He said, I would send it back to the panels and

made a mistake.

The next Chair, who was also enforcing the

19

statute before it was struck down, Ms. Radice, testified

20

in Congress that she would be happy to and would apply

decency to the grant-making process.

22

So I think you have to look - - at this Court

23

said in Forsyth County, in a facial challenge you have to

24

look at how the agency has in fact applied the statute.

correct -- my basic question is, given the uncertainty

9

that you -- you started with a premise, and if I accept

10

that premise a lot flows.
You said, all they're doing is subsidizing

11

What's problematic about this statute is, it

1

2

singles out art precisely because it has a nonconforming

3

or disrespectful viewpoint and, as this Court has said,

4

even when the Government is allocating subsidies, if it's

5

doing it to private speakers it can't skew the marketplace

6

by attempting to impost that kind of ideological screen.

problem in my mind, for you, is I can easily think of

some - - some instances of importance in the life of the

14

NEA where it would be obviously appropriate or lawful to

15

take into account even tough standards of decency, and the

other problem for you is, I don't know what the word

decency means.

sense of it, in which no work of art that is good could be

indecent.

that sense, that a great work of art is also an indecent

work.

It's very hard for me to think, if I think of

I can't think of one.
So since we don't know either the -- let's call

The Court said that is not permissible to defeat
a statute which is vague and gives the agency - -

7

QUESTION:

Well then, should we also strike down

8

the entire NEA, because at the very beginning of it, after

9

all, there is at the very beginning all kinds of language

10

about how this has to be done with general regard for

11

taxpayer sensibilities, and do we have to strike down the

12

FCC statute because the FCC says award licenses in the

3

public interest, which has been plainly interpreted to

4

give the FCC power to do all kinds of restrictions in the

5

area of indecency.

6

I mean, there are lots of statutes on the

7

statute books that have general language that might be

interpreted by an agency to censor in accordance with

viewpoints, but the agency doesn't do it.

is that the application of such open-ended criteria to an

Let's assume the agency didn't,

because I think that's going to be a very controverted

proposition that wouldn't justify a summary judgment.

Let's assume that the agency has not interpreted it in

such a way that there's any constitutional violation of

the sort you allege, but let's also assume that you claim

9

that in doing it that way, they are not complying with the

proper interpretation of the statute, all right.
Would you not still make the argument that since
the statute says something different from what they're

3

doing, our First Amendment cases, which allow challenges

4

of a much broader scope than in other fields, would enable

5

your clients to say that they are being deterred from

developing indecent artistic programs by the statute

make that claim, but we would also make the claim, Justice

Justice Rehnquist.

I'm saying if that were the case, but

that is not the case, as the record makes absolutely

the NEA wants to give a grant for somebody to produce

panel's sitting there and saying, you know, I grant you

it's as good a work of art as anything else, purely

artistically, but I don't think that this particular work

of art is appropriate for a school, for a public place,

6

for a television program.

7

And then the hardest case, you know, which

8

you're most likely to say yes, that's -- I agree with you,

hypothetical, Justice Kennedy, if what it means is that it

QUESTION:

But that's the problem, what it

means, that -- and that's -- the Government tells us, this

18

is what it means, and you say no, it can't mean that, and

19

two courts have said it can't mean that.

20

And yet the Government is saying, here were

21

words, decent, respect.

They can be interpreted different

22

ways, and usually I thought it was the obligation of a

23

Government officer to give words a meaning that renders

24

them consistent, not inconsistent with constitutional

25

limitations, and yet you're insisting that Government

officers take the position with respect to these two words

2

that they interpret them in the way that would be most

3

offensive to the Constitution.

4

MR. COLE:

Well, I'm just saying what they did,

5

and I'm saying that the suggestion that decency and

6

respect might be considered simply through picking diverse

7

panels and no more, and not taking decency and respect

8

even into account in choosing the panels is completely

9

inconsistent with the statute.

11

It would render the --

Congress in the statute said, decency and

judged, in 954(d)(1).

In 959(c) it said, panels shall be

You can't -- they must have meant something when

16

they put the decency and respect clause in the criteria

subsection of the statute, and not in the panel selection.

QUESTION:

Mr. Cole, may I ask you a question

19

about your constitutional position?

20

about what the statute means.

21

We've talked a lot

Assume your meaning - - your reading of the

22

statute is entirely correct.

23

you draw this distinction between the Government as a

24

speaker and the Government subsidizing private speech, and

25

I have two questions.

As I understand your brief,

First, if the Government has a list of topics

1

2

such as say no to drugs, guns are dangerous, preserve the

3

environment, one, I think you would agree they could

4

subsidize private speech by saying we want poems, plays

5

and so forth advocating those particular causes.

6

MR. COLE:

Right.

7

QUESTION:

And maybe have a list of 20 things.

8

Now, if they can do that by subsidizing private

9

speakers to come up with creative ways of carrying that

10

message, why can they not subsidize all other speech and

11

say, you may not contravene any of the messages we want to

12

finance?

3

MR. COLE:

Well, the reason, I think, is the

4

distinction this Court drew in Rosenberger between

5

Government speech and facilitating private expression, and

6

when the Government comes out and says, we're engaging in

7

a Government speech program, we know, as the citizens of

8

the United States, it is the Government speaking.

9

When they hire artists to do a Say No to Drugs

20

campaign throughout the schools, et cetera, we know it's

2

the Government speaking.

22

24
25

We can take that into account.

When they, by contrast, set up a program which
is purportedly a program to fund -QUESTION:

We will finance

Now, what -- there's no mystery about what

5

they're saying.

You're saying that it's kind of a

6

misleading thing because they tell everybody we're

7

subsidizing everything, but I'm saying the statute is

8

perfectly clear that there are 20 topics that may not be

9

controverted.

Now, there's no misleading aspect to it.

10

MR. COLE:

Well --

11

QUESTION:

Why can't they do that?

12

MR. COLE:

-- that was Rosenberger.

In

Rosenberger they said, we're not funding religious

viewpoints.

QUESTION:

Your whole point -- your whole case

because in Lamb's Chapel this Court held that viewpoint

Cornelius it held the same.
