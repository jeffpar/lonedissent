ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN R. KUNEY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. KUNEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case arises out of a holding by the court

12

of appeals that a particularly stringent standard of

13

review, and not abuse of discretion or manifest error,

14

should govern appellate review of district court

15

decisions, excluding expert testimony under Rule 702 and

16

this Court's Daubert opinion.

17

The factors that this Court has considered in

18

its recent standard of review decisions all point to abuse

19

of discretion as the appropriate standard here:

20

discretion given to trial courts under Federal Rules of

21

Evidence 104(a) and 702, the consistent practice before

22

the adoption of the Federal Rules of deferential appellate

23

review of decisions admitting expert testimony, and the

24

clear functional advantages of the trial courts in making

25

these intensely fact-bound determinations.

the broad

1

Indeed, the conclusion that abuse of discretion

2

is the appropriate standard for review of 702 decisions

3

has been reached by no less than 10 courts of appeals.

4

Notwithstanding all these considerations, the

5

court below embraced what it called particularly stringent

6

review for decisions excluding, but not admitting, expert

7

testimony, citing as authority its reading of this Court's

8

Daubert opinion and the Third Circuit's opinion in Paoli,
which had called for a, quote, hard look at exclusions of

10

expert testimony that rejul -- result in summary judgment.

11

In so doing, the court below articulated an expressly

12

one-sided standard of review, whose precise scope and

13

meaning are not clear and whose likely and perhaps

14

intended effect seems to be to discourage the exercise of

15

the discretion inherent in the gatekeeping function this

16

Court outlined in Daubert.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Kuney, even if you're correct,

18

that the abuse of discretion is the standard of review,

1

the Respondents tell us that we still would have to affirm

20

under an abuse of discretion standard, and it doesn't make

21

any difference in this case.

22

that argument?

23

MR. KUNEY:

Are you going to address

Yes, Justice O'Connor, I will.

I

24

think it makes a difference for a variety of reasons.

law, and never had occasion to apply its novel standard of

with what the district court had done with respect to

2

animal studies and epidemiolog -- epidemiological data,

3

but never to declare or find that the court abused its

4

discretion in making the decisions that it had made.

5

QUESTION:

When -- when you say abuse of

6

discretion, as opposed to perhaps de novo review,

7

Mr. Kuney, I take it that means that a -- a properly

8

acting district court might have reached different --

9

different conclusions on the same evidence, and both would

10
11

be affirmed on appeal?
MR. KUNEY:

Mr. chief Justice, I believe that

12

could happen, although I don't believe that could have

13

happened in this case.

14

there - - there would have - - there should have been only

15

one possible ruling by the district court.

16

general matter, it is absolutely correct that abuse of

17

discretion suggests a range of decisions that district

18

courts could reach.

19

QUESTION:

I think, on the record here,

But, as a

And I suppose if you say it's de novo

20

review on an evidentiary point, there would be a lot more

21

reversals in courts of appeals, not just in any one kind

22

of case, but across the board.

23

MR. KUNEY:

I -- I believe that's the intention

24

of those who articulated this standard -- in fact, was to

25

invite greater appellate reversal of district court

are going to get it wrong, and really calls for the

necessity of greater appellate intervention for this - -

with respect to this gatekeeping function.

in particular, if you look at Judge Becker's

QUESTION:

10

Mr. Kuney,

the -- the court of

11

appeals -- the nub of -- of one of the court of appeals'

12

points was that the district court had focused on the

13

soundness of the results reached by the various studies in

question rather than the methodology and the general

15

acceptance of that methodology.

16

comment on whether this is so or not - - but if the

17

district court did not make it clear from its own

18

exposition whether it was focusing on results rather than

19

methodology - - if there is an ambiguity there - - would you

20

agree that the court of appeals may resolve that ambiguity

21

in,

22

of that ambiguity, in deciding whether the -- the lower

23

court opinion should be read as focusing on result or on

That itself would not be subject to an abuse of

MR. KUNEY:

Justice Souter, I don't believe this

5

interpretation of what the district court was doing.

QUESTION:

In

Though, of course, we wouldn't have

taken the case just to review that.
MR. KUNEY:

-- what -- what courts of appeals

10

often do in -- in situations where there is abuse of

11

discretion review, and they find that the record does not

12

provide what the court of appeals believes is an adequate

13

explanation of how the district judge exercised his or her

14

discretion, then a remand for a better explanation from

15

the trial court is often done.

16

QUESTION:

Because there are -- there are --

17

there are two inadequacies that might be in question.

One

18

inadequacy might be the court of - - the district court

19

didn't make it clear which prong, as it were, it was

20

focusing on.

21

assuming it focused on the correct prong, the

22

methodological one, it -- it simply did not do an adequate

23

job of justifying its -- its position.

saying, I guess, that there should be an abuse of

The second inadequacy might be that,

MR. KUNEY:

Yes, that's correct.

That's

correct.

This

determination is accomplished by establishing that the

predicate principles and methodology relied upon by the

experts are valid and that they can be applied to the

facts at issue.

And it seems to me that that is also in accord
with your position?

7

MR. KUNEY:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Yes.
And then he says:

The sufficiency of

the evidence and the weight of the evidence, however, are
beyond the scope of the Daubert analysis.
Is -- is he mixing apples and oranges there,

11
12

or - - or - - or is he correct in that statement, as -- as

well?

a sufficiency problem -- I assume, because that -- that's

15

why he concurred.

And it was his concern, I -- I think, that this was

MR. KUNEY:

That's how I would read that, Your

17

Honor - - that - - that he thought that perhaps what the

18

district court had done was to slide from admissibility

19

into sufficiency without clearly articulating that.

20

QUESTION:

But -- but there's an element of

21

sufficiency in the calculus that you want the district

22

judge to apply, is there not?

MR. KUNEY:

"sufficiency" if you want to.

2

testimony is admissible.

3

QUESTION:

And -- and I - -

But -- so we would say that "weight"

4

and "sufficiency," as used here, are just terms of art,

5

and in the sense that we usually use them,

apply to the district judge's determination?

7

MR. KUNEY:

they do not

That's how I read Judge Birch --

8

Birch's concurrence; that he was recognizing two separate

9

issues, and perhaps suggesting that there had been some

10

confusion between the two.

Well, certainly, after -- after

And the court

still has the ability, even if it determines that the

That is, whether it comes close enough to

2

establishing evidence of what the plaintiff wants to

3

prove.

4

The district court could simply exclude that

5

evidence, I suppose, if he thinks it isn't relevant

enough.

7

MR. KUNEY:

I believe that's correct, under

8

the -- under the "fit" prong.

QUESTION:

In which case you say -- in which

10

case you say he'd be reviewed on an abuse of discretion

standard.

12

MR. KUNEY:

13

QUESTION:

Correct.
He could, on the other hand, let it

14

in, and -- and simply grant summary judgment to the

15

defendant on the ground that not sufficiently relevant

16

evidence has been produced to overcome the initial burden

17

that the plaintiff has.

Is -- is it fairly common in -- in

cases now to have these evidentiary questions of

admissibility of expert testimony thrashed out in limine

14

or be -- before the case goes to trial, and then have a

motion for summary judgment based on the court's decision?

16

MR. KUNEY:

Absolutely.

The courts have -- have

17

really developed a variety of procedural vehicles.

18

some circuits, they virtually require an evidentiary

19

hearing.

20

But, increasingly, judges are resolving these issues in

21

advance of trial, both to decide whether summary judgment

is appropriate and so that before the trial unfolds, the

parties will know what evidence is going to be before the

MR. WALLACE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

The gatekeeper role that this Court prescribed

12

in Daubert, as we understand it and as the terms of Rule

13

702 suggest, applies to the testimony of the expert and

14

whether that testimony should be allowed, not just to the

15

question of what studies the expert can advert to - - and

16

usually these are studies done by others, not by

17

himself -- but what he can say about those studies.

18

of the scientific methodology is scientific reasoning,

19

what conclusions are scien -- scientifically, can be said

20

to follow, or at least arguably to follow, from the

21

premises one has.

Many scientists could be found who could

23

describe published studies conducted by others, but the

24

experts are selected by the parties on the basis of what's

25

important in the case, what inferences they're willing to

2

to relate those inferences to the case.

3

counts in these cases, in the gatekeeping function, is to

separate what is scientific reasoning and worthy of

5

consideration under Rule 702 from what is not supported by

6

scientific reasoning and relating published studies to the

7

issues in the case, and therefore should not be submitted

8

to the jury.

9

And what -- what

That is a question based on what is proper

10

scientific reasoning rather than quite the same legal

11

question that Justice Scalia was adverting to in what is

12

sufficient evidence to support a judgement.

13

Respondents concede, is a very contextual, fact -intensive

14

question.

15

of our brief, that there are legal situations in which the

16

question before the court is whether there is a risk to

17

public health or a danger to the environment, including a

18

danger to animal habitats, which would make certain

19

studies relevant in inferences that can be drawn through

20

scientific reasoning to the ultimate issue in the case;

21

quite a different ultimate issue from what's involved

22

here, which is not preventing conduct that may be harmful

23

in a general sense, but trying to determine whether it is

24

more probable than not that a particular person's injury

25

was caused by the defendant.

Mr. Wallace, when you say more

And what is it on page 20 that -- of

with your position?

7

MR. GOTTESMAN:

On their reply brief.

They

8

say -- this is in the first full paragraph -- the court of

9

appeals added that it -- in its view, there was a genuine

10

factual dispute over whether furans and dioxins could have

11

been present in the fluid to which Mr. Joiner was exposed.

12

It never reached the question of whether opinions of

13

causation by furans or dioxins would be admissible,

14

because the district court had not done so.
QUESTION:

15
16

That doesn't strike me as crystal

clear, but per -- perhaps, in context, it --

17

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, let -- let me back up for

18

a minute, because this is just terribly important to us,

19

obviously.

20

They moved for summary judgment and they made

21

two points.

Contrary to the claims of the Plaintiffs,

22

Mr. Joiner was not exposed to furans and dioxins.

23

Therefore, they said, he was only exposed to PCB's.

24

the testimony of Plaintiffs' experts wou -- is not

admissible on the basis of PCB exposure alone.

that the testimony would not be admissible.

That's correct.

You got her reversed for saying there wasn't

you can't find it from the animal studies, and she sweeps

them off the table.

We never hear about them again.

Then she starts with the epidemiological

Number one, said the court of appeals,

Because the Defendants introduced no scientist who said

take.

That -- that -- that

shows that the district court was relying on relevance

rather than methodology.

MR. GOTTESMAN:

The district court was relying

And isn't all the district judge did

MR. GOTTESMAN:

there is no link; yes.
QUESTION:

Well, the district court said
But the district court did not --

And -- and that's within the purview

of the district -- of the district court, if the district

If he -- he abuses his

discretion, or her discretion, then we reverse.

11

that's within the discretion of the trial court, is it

not?
MR. GOTTESMAN:

13

But

That is where we would disagree,

14

Your Honor.

And that is where the court of appeals

disagreed.

16

clear, the district court may not decide whether the

experts' opinions are correct, but merely whether the

bases supporting the conclusion are reliable.

The court of appeals said, as Daubert makes

that -- that maybe the methodology prong is just a red

inquiry for the defendant to come forward with scientific

evidence that says you can't get from A to B -- not just

4

that I, the competing scientist, disagree -- because

scientists disagree all the time - - but that the range of

as good science, does not allow you to go from A to B.
QUESTION:

10

But is there really much difference

between the first and second position that you just
described?
MR. GOTTESMAN:

11

Yes.

And let me give you one

12

very good example of that.

They point, in their reply

13

brief, to the -- the testimony of some of their

14

witnesses -- none of whom addressed the Plaintiffs'

15

witnesses' testimony -- and say, see, this shows your

methodology is bad.

17

on page 12 of their reply brief, are the testimony of

18

Dr. Waddell at deposition.

And they -- several of the examples,

Dr. Waddell was asked at that definition with

19
20

respect to the very testimony they're citing:

Is the view

21

that you're stating here widely accepted in the scientific

22

community?

23

And his response was:

24

scientists who see it the same way I do.

25

number-wise, are in the minority.

This is on page 269 of the joint appendix.

They probably,

That's what

they're citing to show that our scientists were not

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN R. KUNEY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

QUESTION:

Would you mind telling us if there's

10

something left here to be tried when it goes back and

11

whether the district court has to then make a

12

determination whether to admit expert testimony if it is

13

found that furans and dioxides were part of the expos - -

14

exposure?

15

MR. KUNEY:

Yes, Justice O'Connor, I believe it

16

is technically correct that in the motion for summary

17

judgment, the only argument Defendants put forward about

18

furans and dioxins was that there had been no exposure.

19

So the district judge was not asked to rule upon whether

20

opinions that accepted that exposure could meet the

21

scientific requirements of Rule 702.

22

left before the district court.

So that issue is

23

And then, if there is a trial, if the district

24

court decides that there are admissible opinions that go

25

to that point, it will be a very different trial than

essentially have to win in front of the factfinder the

3

furans and dioxins exposure point or the case would be

4

over.

5

QUESTION:

Because the Plaintiffs would

Then are we -- we're supposed to

6

assume for argument's sakes that there is inadmissible --

7

because one of the points you raised is that the court of

8

appeals is wrong on its furans point -- there isn't any

9

evidence here that - - that there were furans and dioxins.

10

MR. KUNEY:

11

QUESTION:

And -- and -We're supposed to assume, for

12

purposes of this case, that the court of appeals is right

13

on that point.

14

is we assume they're right, we remand to the court of

15

appeals, and we ask the court of appeals to remand to the

16

district court for consideration of furans and dioxins; is

17

that the bottom line?

18

So the bottom line, in - - in your opinion,

MR. KUNEY:

That's correct.

You -- you could in

19

-- instruct the court of appeals that under of an abuse of

20

discretion standard, which it should have applied, the

21

district court's exclusion of the PCB opinions was clearly

22

within the district court's discretion.

24

ought to be reinstated.
