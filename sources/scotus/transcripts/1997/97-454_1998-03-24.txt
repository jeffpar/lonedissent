ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOIS J.

SCHIFFER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MS. SCHIFFER:

9
10

We'll hear argument

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it

please the Court:

11

At issue in this case is under what

12

circumstances is a parent corporation directly liable

13

through its own acts as an operator of a facility under

14

CERCLA?

*

This is a case of statutory construction.

15
16

Congress,

17

responsible for causing pollution at a facility

18

responsible to remediate it created a system that holds,

19

among others,

"any person who owned or operated" a

Owner or operator is a defined term in the

23

statute.

and ordinary meaning.
The dictionary definition of operate is in the

2

3

context of an industrial facility any person who exercises

4

managerial control over that industrial plant, and we

5

think that this is the appropriate test to apply here.

6

Under CERCLA, the term any person is given a

7

broad definition and includes any corporation, whether a

8

parent or a subsidiary.
QUESTION:

9

Thus --

Well, Ms. Schiffer, surely you would

10

agree that under the statute not every parent is liable

11

under this statute for the operation of a facility by a

12

subsidiary.

13
14

MS. SCHIFFER:

We would absolutely agree with

that.

15

QUESTION:

And there mere fact that there are

16

interlocking directorships, or perhaps managers who serve

17

both corporations, wouldn't determine that, would it?

18

MS. SCHIFFER:

That is exactly correct, Justice

19

O'Connor.

20

are interlocking directorships may be an evidentiary

21

factor in determining whether the parent corporation is

22

operating the facility.

23

It would not determine it.

QUESTION:

The fact that there

Well, I'm not sure it should even do

24

that, I mean, if our ordinary understanding of the

25

corporate structure and reasonable investment-backed

1

expectations is that we recognize the corporate separate

2

entities, and we recognize that a parent can have a

3

subsidiary and that a parent isn't liable for what the

4

subsidiary does in normal circumstances.

5

MS. SCHIFFER:

Justice O'Connor, what we're

6

talking about here, and which is consistent with the

7

common law, is what the action of the parents are as a

8

company toward the facility, not what the actions of the

9

parent are toward the subsidiary, and while there may be

10

useful evidence in how the parent acts toward the

11

subsidiary, the real question is, how did the parent

12

company directly affect or actively participate in the

13

management of the facility.

14

QUESTION:

I think that's helpful, and I don't

15

think the district court did that.

16

the district court focused on the relation of the parent

17

to the subsidiary, and a corporate veil-piercing type of

18

analysis, and certainly the Sixth Circuit did.

19

MS. SCHIFFER:

It seemed to me that

Well, let me start first with the

20

district court, Justice Kennedy.

21

did is make very detailed and extensive factual findings

22

that included information about the activities of the

23

parent toward the subsidiary, but was in no way limited to

24

that.

25

What the district court

For example, there were specific factual

findings made about Mr. Williams, who was a -- an employee

2

of the parent company, and the actions he had toward

3

pollution-related activities at the facility that was

4

operated by the subsidiary.

5

The -- it's easy to confuse here, because, in

6

fact, for much of the time at issue the subsidiary

7

companies operated only a single facility.

8

operated the facility at Muskegon, Michigan.

9

it was its only activity.

Ott II
For 3 years

For the remaining 4 years that

10

Ott II was active here it owned one other facility in

11

North Carolina, but all of the evidence the district court

12

looked at went to the facility in Michigan.

13

Similarly, as to the --

14

QUESTION:

Ms. Schiffer, is that so?

I mean, he

15

did discuss financial control and he discussed many things

16

that gave me the impression the distinction between the

17

parent controlling the subsidiary and the parent

18

controlling the facility of the subsidiary is a

19

distinction much easier said than applied in fact, because

20

much of what the district judge said, it seemed to me,

21

could be fit under the category, this parent is

22

controlling the subsidiary.

23

MS. SCHIFFER:

Your Honor, it may be instructive

24

to look at some of the specific findings that the district

25

court made, keeping in mind, again, that for much of the

1

time, or for a substantial part of the time the subsidiary

2

owned only this one facility, so that when we're talking

3

about -- when the district court was talking about

4

activities of the subsidiary it was really talking about

5

activities at this particular facility.
But for example, at petitioner's appendix 75a,

6

7

where there are facts about the activities of Mr.

8

Williams, it talked about Mr. Williams instructed Ott II

9

officials to limit cooperation with State and Federal

10

regulators regarding waste disposal, plainly implicitly at

11

this facility, and to consult with CPC before responding

12

to regulatory questionnaires or other inquiries.

13
14

There are also a list of the pertinent -- some
of the findings that the district --

QUESTION:

He was an Ott board member though,

wasn't he?

MS. SCHIFFER:

member, Your Honor.

Mr. Williams was not an Ott board

Mr. Williams was simply an employee

QUESTION:

Okay.

Okay.

I'm -- I --

21

QUESTION:

May I ask if the case would be

22

different if Mr. Williams, in addition to his

23

responsibilities for the parent, had also been on the

24

board of directors of the subsidiary and on the payroll of

25

the subsidiary and an officer of the subsidiary?

MS. SCHIFFER:

We do not think the case

it

would be a different set of facts, Your Honor, but we do
not think the outcome would be particularly different,
because we think what is probative and what the standard
is is, did the parent company participate in management of
the facility, and the activities of Mr. Williams were such
that -QUESTION:

But you suggested at the outset that

there's a distinction between controlling the subsidiary
and directly controlling the facility, and if everything
that they did to control the facility was done by
directing an officer to do what he thought was
appropriate, then the officer went ahead and ran the
facility, would that meet your test or not?
MS. SCHIFFER:

It's a very fact-specific test,

Your Honor, but it is likely that it would meet it.

We

can get some helpful guidance from the lender liability
provisions of this statute, which were added in 1996 by
Congress and which defined participation in management,
and what they look at is the particular act -- it is
Congress giving content to the concept participation and
management in the context of banks or lenders, but they
provide helpful guidance for any corporation that is
actively participating in management.

Williams' position who had no position, nominal or

2

otherwise, either on the board or in the management of the

3

subsidiary, but who were nonetheless directing the

4

subsidiary's own offices and employees?

5

MS. SCHIFFER:

I have two responses to that,

6

Justice Souter.

The district court made specific findings

7

about something called the CPC Development Company, which

8

was a division of CPC, and while some of the people

9

involved at the CPC Development Company were related to

10

the Ott II facility, the Court indicates that not all of

11

them were.

12

In addition --

13

QUESTION:

But were the ones who were not so

14

related independently and directingly -- directly giving

15

orders to the subsidiary?

<•

16

MS. SCHIFFER:

The district court's findings go

17

to the CPC Development Company as an entity, not -- one I

18

believe can't discern from the facts --

19
20
21

QUESTION:
with Williams.

So that's not quite on the same plane

Anyone else like Williams?

MS. SCHIFFER:

There was no one else singled out

22

particularly, but I would suggest to the court that the

23

district court's findings, which talk about CPC, not -- in

24

a number of instances, not CPC's officers, not CPC's

25

managers, CPC itself, don't -- doesn't -- the Court

doesn't directly say that its finding that those officers

2

and managers were acting when they were involved with the

3

Ott facility as in their CPC capacity, but it certainly is

4

the sensible reading and the implicit reading we --

5

QUESTION:

Well --

6

QUESTION:

What does not that mean?

What does

7

that mean, to be acting in your CPC capacity, when you are

8

both an officer of CPC and an officer of the subsidiary of

9

CPC?

Is there any difference between the two?

The

10

interest of CPC and the interests of the subsidiary are

11

identical.

12

MS. SCHIFFER:

If the legal -- the legal

13

standard we're espousing is that it is CPC that is

14

actively managing the facility.

15

whether the district court's findings that talk about CPC

16

really mean that it is Ott that's taking the actions, in

17

fact the court specifically talks about CPC itself, and we

18

think that, and particularly the facts that are listed at

19

pages 11 and 12 of our opening brief, underscore that it

20

is the parent company that is operating the facility

21

within the meaning of operate.

22

QUESTION:

If the question is

No, but unless we get a situation

23

like Williams, how do we avoid the problem that Justice

24

Ginsburg said that she had in reading the findings?

25

How do we draw some metaphysical line between

1

CPC as the operator and CPC simply getting the benefit of

2

the influence which it undoubtedly has as a parent through

3

the ownership of stock and through the frequently

4

overlapping composition of the officers and directors?

5

How do we draw that line when we don't have kind of an

6

easy Williams example?

7

MS. SCHIFFER:

Your Honor, the legal standard

8

is, was the parent company acting at the facility, and the

9

district court findings which talk about CPC managing and

10

controlling and operating at the facility don't give the

11

Court an easy line but they certainly give the Court a

12

base, a basis, with these extensive findings of fact, for

13

determining that it was the parent company that was

14

undertaking the operation.

15

QUESTION:

16

see that it gives me a basis.

17

Well, if I may interrupt you, I don't

It seems to me that what it gives me is a

18

conclusion.

19

operating, when all I can tell beyond that conclusion is

20

that their -- that CPC owns the stock, that there are some

21

directors who sit on each of the two boards, that there

22

may be some officers or some individuals who are officers

23

of each of the two corporations, that leaves me saying,

differentiates it from the position of any parent of any

operating subsidiary, and I don't know the answer to that

2

question here.
MS. SCHIFFER:

3

We think that this is not the

4

same as any -- as the typical parent of the typical

5

corporation, because CPC here was undertaking much more

6

active involvement.
Under the findings of fact of the district court

7
8

it was making managerial decisions about waste handling,

9

it was making managerial decisions about a number of other

10

operative aspects of the facility, and that when the

11

district court findings talk about CPC, not CPC's

12

officers, not CPC's directors, though it does that, too,

13

but CPC specifically, it was indicating that the CPC

14

officers, managers, and directors who were active at the

15

Ott facility were there with their CPC hat on, not with

16

the Ott --

17

QUESTION:

Well, now do we know they have their

18

CPC hat on by virtue of some unusual resolution of the CPC

19

board that they were executing?

QUESTION:

Ms Schiffer --

May I --

QUESTION:

-- may I ask you,

9

in view of -- this

question has been brewing for some time,

and there are

10

diverse statutes where Congress does provide for reaching

11

a parent -- sometimes 80 percent test -- has there been in

all this time any proposal,

the subsidiary's conduct?

There has been over the past 5 years a lot of

activity in Congress looking at Superfund reauthorization

and to my knowledge this issue has not come up.

the same test if it were a statute that used the word use?

2

Why couldn't you say just as easily that the parent uses

3

the facility or uses some -- or any verb?
I don't know what there is distinctive about the

4
5

verb manage, so that we're going to have a special test

6

for this statute.

7

this statute ought to be applied to any statute.
MS. SCHIFFER:

8

I worry that whatever test we apply to

Justice Scalia -- and this is --

we think that each statute needs to be looked at in its

10

own terms for what it does.

11

12

have, for industrial plants have a concept of managerial

13

control.

14

Here, Congress used the term

The dictionary definitions of those

Congress also was helpful in the lender context

15

in using the words, participate in management, which are

16

helpful, but the courts that have looked at this issue

17

have used slightly different verbal formulations.

18

come down to the same idea, which is --

QUESTION:

I'm sorry, I used the wrong word.

It's operate, which you say is -- includes management, but

used in this statute, and defined to mean operate so

subsidiary is operating something the parent is not

2

operating it, unless, you know, there's veil-piercing.

3

Now, you say that because the word -- the word

4

operate is used here, that there's some special -- we're

5

not supposed to treat it like an ordinary corporate

6

situation.

7

has that special meaning.

8

9

I don't see what that verb -- why that verb

MS. SCHIFFER:

We do not think this is a

situation where what is the key test is the relationship

10

between the parent and the subsidiary, which is what veil­

11

piercing gets to, but rather what is the relationship of

12

the parent company or any company to the facility, to the

13

activities that are causing the pollution that then is

14

leading to the cleanup, or to the activity of managing the

15

whole facility, even without regard to the pollution, but

16

which leads to the causing of the pollution.

17

What Your Honor is describing is the corporate

18

veil standard which, when it's pierced, is pierced for all

19

purposes, which goes to the relationship between the

20

parent and the subsidiary.

21

What we are looking at is the relationship of

22

the parent company to the site, to the site where the

23

pollution is being caused.

Well, supposing -- and with regard to

Mr. Williams' case I guess is your strongest case,
supposing the record showed that whenever he went down -went over to Muskegon or wherever he went to look at the
facility and participate, he was especially put on the
payroll of the subsidiary for that period of time, and
paid by the subsidiary for the work he did, would that
make a difference?

Your Honor.

It would certainly be a factor,

What we know as to Mr. Williams

is that he always worked for -- he was an employee of CPC,
and there's no indication in the record that he was in the
employ of Ott II, the subsidiary.

Ms. Schiffer, is it the Government's

view that if its view of the law is accepted this Court
could simply order the district court judgment affirmed?

Government that if we accept your view of the law, that we

2

could order that the district court's judgment be

MS. SCHIFFER:

4

Yes, it is, because our view of

5

the law is essentially what the district court applied to

6

its fact-findings.

7

QUESTION:

Is it -- suppose -- I don't -- I'm

8

having trouble with the -- you've said two separate

9

things.

One is, just look at the relation of the parent

10

to the dump, and the other thing was that the parent would

11

have to take some action not normal to the parent's

12

subsidiary relation.

13

I'm trying to sort those out.

Suppose that Mr. and Mrs. Smith and their son,

14

John, run a toxic waste dump, and they have a company

15

called the Smith Family Limited Liability Corporation.

16

They do everything themselves.

17

They operate it.

w

18

Nobody else does a thing.

They're not personally liable, are they?

MS. SCHIFFER:

Under the standard that we

19

propose, Your Honor, if Mr. or Mrs. Smith -- if Mrs. Smith

20

made active managerial decisions --

21

QUESTION:

Look, I said Mr. and Mrs. Smith and

22

their son, John, do everything.

23

They

They are

Now, I would think that that is the classic

1

2

situation of where a group of people form a corporation to

3

limit their liability.

That's why we have corporations.

Is there any suggestion in what you say that the

4
5

Smith family is personally liable?

6

going on.

Nothing special's

It's ordinary.
MS. SCHIFFER:

7

Any facility can have more than

8

one operator, Your Honor, and it is our view that if Mr.

9

and Mrs. Smith themselves personally operated the

0

facility, that is, actively participated in the management

11

of the facility, that they would be liable.
QUESTION:

12

Isn't the next case exactly that?

3

Wasn't there already a case by this same -- of a sole

4

shareholder corporation?

5

MS. SCHIFFER:

There was, Your Honor.

Donahey

6

v. Bogle was that case, and the sole shareholder also ran

7

the place.

9

QUESTION:

So your view is that if a group of

people incorporate themselves and they personally operate

20

the dump, they are personally liable, so in this statute

21

alone -- I've never seen another statute like that --

22

there is no way for a group of operators to form a

23

corporation and thereby exempt themselves from personal

24

liability.

I mean, is -- that's the view of the Government?

1

Because I would have thought that if that's the view you

2

would have expected Congress to say something about that

3

rather unusual -- I think it would be unusual.
MS. SCHIFFER:

4

Congress did say two things, Your

5

Honor.

One is that it defined any person in a broad

6

fashion to include a corporation or to include

7

individuals.
It was not looking at the corporate form, but

8

9

rather at the reality of what was happening, and secondly

10

it began the section 107 liability provision by saying,

11

notwithstanding any other provision of law and subject

12

only to three specified defenses in the statute.

13

QUESTION:

Is there any other statute, of which

14

you are aware, where it imposes liability is imposed on

15

some entity -- call it person, individual, whatever -- and

16

without saying it explicitly, the liability flows to

17

individual shareholders, it flows to directors, it flows

18

to the corporate form makes no difference, doesn't limit

19

liability?

20

MS. SCHIFFER:

Your Honor, the -- in the -- I'm

21

not particularly aware of any other case, but decisions of

22

this Court under other statutes have looked beyond

23

corporate form to what is actually going on here, and here

24

Congress was particularly concerned that those who were

25

making decisions that caused the pollution would bear the

economic responsibility for cleaning it up.
QUESTION:

2

Well, Ms. Schiffer, your position on

3

behalf of the Government does propose a very fuzzy sort of

4

line here to do something that is quite contrary to normal

5

investment-backed expectations, and which may not be

6

clearly mandated by the language of the statute.

7

And maybe because of that the Sixth Circuit,

8

whose judgment we're reviewing, said, we give up.

We're

9

going to apply normal State veil-piercing doctrine, and

10

unless the veil is pierced so the corporation is a sham,

11

we're going to protect the corporate entity.

12

that's what happened.

13

MS. SCHIFFER:

I guess

The Sixth Circuit really looked

14

at the concept of derivative liability.

What Congress did in the Superfund law is look

consistent with --

QUESTION:

Well, I know that's what you're

saying, but it gets us back to that same question of how

21

you draw the line and whether the statute is, indeed, that

clear.

for how much activity and operation is necessary to meet

QUESTION:

5

And under that definition, and under

6

what I think is your answer to Justice Breyer, and I want

7

to be very clear about this, it would be very rare that a

8

corporation would be solely liable and not have some of

9

its principal managers, operators, officers, also liable,

10

is that not right?
MS. SCHIFFER:

11

It would not be -- it would be

12

very rare, Your Honor, because the ordinary corporation

13

which is acting in a supervisory capacity through a

14

subsidiary and not with active management would not be

15

liable --

QUESTION:

No, forget parent and subsidiary.

17

It's very unusual for a corporation to commit a tort by

itself without some human actor.

MS. SCHIFFER:

QUESTION:

Yes, and --

And the human actor is a co­

tortfeasor, and I take it your answer to Justice Breyer

was that by using the word, any person, in 9607(b), that

the Congress would make all of the people in his

hypothetical that were actively participating in the waste

I take it that you could maintain your position

assumes that Congress meant to respect corporate forms,

20

that Congress did not mean to look behind every corporate

structure whenever an employee of the corporation performs

a duty, and still maintain your position.

You could respect the corporate form and still, in effect,

get your -- the result that you think is proper in this

case?

8

9

under those circumstances in order to get CPC

MS. SCHIFFER:

That's exactly correct, Your

Honor, and we think that our theory is consistent with

10

respecting the corporate form because it looks at what is

11

the corporation doing for its own activities.

12

QUESTION:

Right, but I thought in answer to

13

Justice Breyer's question you were getting to the point

14

where -- of saying that whenever the employee of a

corporation does the act which forms a part of the

16

operation, that the employee is an operator and therefore

17

liable regardless of whether the employee is acting as a

18

maverick in relation to his corporate organization or

19

whether he is doing exactly what his corporate

20

organization told him to do, and now I think you're saying

21

you're maybe not going that far.

QUESTION:

So --

6

QUESTION:

So I think that you were saying that

7

in any close corporation there would be shareholder

8

liability.

9

MS. SCHIFFER:

In fact, what the cases that look

10

at shareholder liability really are taking people who are

11

shareholders and chief executive officers and really are

12

the active managers.

13

QUESTION:

I'm referring to a family

14

corporation, the kind Justice Breyer described, a one-

15

person corporation, a closed corporation, very small

group, where they're all involved in running the business.

17

In all those cases your theory is, you would reach the

18

people who are operating, the participants in those close

19

corporations.

20

MS. SCHIFFER:

We think that is what Congress

21

intended by its definition of the term, operator, to

assure that those who are responsible for the pollution

MR. GELLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Under CERCLA, a past or present owner or

5
6

operator of a hazardous waste facility is liable for

7

cleanup costs paid by the Government.

8

this case is whether a parent corporation becomes an

9

operator under CERCLA simply by participating in and

10

exerting some unspecified degree of control over the

11

affairs of a subsidiary that operates such a facility.

12

The question in

The answer to that question, in our view, turns

13

entirely on whether Congress meant to sweep away

14

traditional common law principles of limited shareholder

15

liability merely by using the word operator in CERCLA.

16

We believe that the Government's theory of

17

parent company liability is unsupportable for a number of

18

reasons.

19

inconsistent with the language of the statute itself.

20

CERCLA imposes liability on persons that operate a

Mr. Ott

officers who had dual -- who wore the two hats, Ott and
Eiszner, who had been employees of Ott I when it was taken
over by CPC, shared their time between Muskegon and New
Jersey, spent most of their time at CPC -QUESTION:

It would be better for your case if

the dual employees lived in Muskegon.

What's better for

your case is if the sole employee, such as Williams, lived
in New Jersey.

That helps you.

But the fact that the dual employees were at
CPC's headquarters -MR. GELLER:

It doesn't matter where they lived.

The question is, when these dual employees took actions on
behalf of Ott II, is it appropriate to attribute those
actions to the parent CPC, and the common law rule is
clearly no.
QUESTION:

But do you agree the record doesn't

tell us who paid their salary when they were working?
Supposing they were paid entirely by the parent for
everything they did, would that make a difference?
MR. GELLER:

If they were employee -- if they

were acting -- if they were dual employees, it seems to
me, Justice Stevens, it doesn't matter who paid their
salaries.

The question is, in what capacity were they

acting, and if they were acting in their capacity as

MR. GELLER:

Strange.
-- silly to speculate.

The

question is, who is responsible for the activities of

these dual employees, and the common law answers that

question quite clearly.

12

here is a new Federal common law rule to attribute all of

that activity to the parent, and there's absolutely no

They made him a

But I took it that the big difference between

10

the district court and the Sixth Circuit was, what is the

11

source of law that we look to, because if it's State law

through, but if you -- on the district judge's view and on

That's correct, Justice Stevens.

20

The district court adopted this new middle ground of

liability, which is something in between direct liability

Now, maybe that's right, maybe that's wrong, but

MR. GELLER:

12

The test is whether the parent can

be said to be operating.

be operating, Justice Kennedy, is through its employees,

15

and therefore, in order to meet the Government's test you

have to show that some employee of CPC did anything that

extrapolated on that a little.

MR. GELLER:

That's what I took

Well, there was a -- if I could

just finish the answer to Justice Kennedy's question, if I

could, you have to find that some employe of CPC was doing

you could conclude that CPC itself -- there was no

The only evidence that the district court

relied on was the dual officers, that Ott and Eiszner

This is hardly a case of an

of this, I would refer the Court to the findings of the

MR. GELLER:

1
'

That's what they say.

There's

2

certainly nothing in the legislative history or anywhere

3

else to support that, but even if that were true, in their

4

view operating includes the concept of control, and

5

therefore there would still have been no reason for

6

Congress to have put otherwise controlled in there.
Congress could have said, whoever was operating

7
8

the facility immediately before it was abandoned, but

9

Congress didn't do that.

They said, owned, operated, or

10

controlled the facility immediately before it was

11

abandoned, so this clearly shows that operator requires

12

something different than mere control.

13

In addition, as you said, pointed out, Justice

14

Ginsburg, there are many other statutes, many other

21

they were taken as true, and I would refer the Court to

MR. GELLER:

Yes.

That's what the Sixth Circuit held.

the Sixth Circuit adopted the correct legal standard, and

we think that it reviewed the record in this case and

Now, I just want to conclude by saying that

although the Government tries to sugar-coat its position,

if the evidence here is sufficient to find the parent

by virtue of the Government's two-step theory, it would
