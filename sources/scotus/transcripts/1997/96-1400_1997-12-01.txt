ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH C. RUSCONI

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. RUSCONI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The action below was one in rem by a private

12

party to try title as against all the world and for

13

exclusive salvage rights to a vessel lying upon the

14

sovereign submerged lands of the State of California.

15

In this situation, California claims title and

16

rights to salvage over that same vessel, and the Eleventh

17

Amendment prevents the adjudication of California's

18

interests in this case without its consent.

19

Under this Court's Eleventh Amendment

20

jurisprudence, the guiding principle in these cases is the

21

effect of the relief requested on the State.

22

conclusion is not dependent upon formalisms or upon the

23

manipulation of captions or pleadings.

24
25

This

Had this suit been in personam against the State
under the same circumstances there is no doubt that the

1

suit would have been barred by the Eleventh Amendment, and

2

this result cannot be changed by the substitution of the

3

vessel as defendant for the State of California.

4
5

QUESTION:

Well, there's really no such thing as

an in rem action, then.

6

MR. RUSCONI:

7

QUESTION:

No, that's --

Well, I mean, you cannot possibly

8

adjudicate the rights to a particular piece of property.

9

You always have at least 50 claimants --

10

MR. RUSCONI:

11

QUESTION:

12

13

Justice Scalia --- who can come in and say, no, it's

really mine, and this adjudication was for naught.
MR. RUSCONI:

Justice Scalia, all we're asking

14

in this case is that the State be dismissed.

15

can move forward in this with an in rem judgment against

16

the rest of the world.

17

QUESTION:

Now, they

Then it's not an in rem judgment.

18

The whole point, historically, of an in rem judgment in

19

these admiralty actions is that it binds the world, and it

20

seems to me that the implication of what you're saying

21

here is, a State is always part of the world and,

22

therefore, in any admiralty in rem action a State could

23

come forward and say, got to dismiss it, Eleventh

24

Amendment, can't bind me.

25

MR. RUSCONI:

Justice Souter, I believe that is

1

what we are saying.

2

that, States are not going to run around willy nilly and

3

make these type of claims.
QUESTION:

4

However, the practical effect of

And isn't the reason that they're

5

not -- isn't the reason that you're not going to file this

6

kind of an objection on, let's say, an East Coast salvage

7

case is that there is no colorable basis, in your mind or

8

anybody else's, for your doing so, for your having a claim

9

that might be cut off and therefore in fact adjudicated by

10

the in rem action?
MR. RUSCONI:

11
12

13

That will be the practical effect,

yes.
QUESTION:

All right.

Then what would be wrong

14

with a rule, and maybe it would be a softer rule than the

15

circuit applied here, which says you have at least got to

16

come forward and make a sufficient showing that you are

17

within the class of those whose interests might, in fact,

18

be adjudicated here?

19

You've done that, in fact, in part by what

20

you've done so far.

After all, in this case the original

21

in rem process describes the location, so you said, look,

22

we're within the class of those geographically that might

23

be affected, and what would be wrong with carrying that

24

one step further and simply saying, all right, make an

25

equally colorable showing that you're also within the

1

class as defined by other criteria, abandonment,

2

embeddedness, historic register?
It doesn't mean -- this rule would not mean that

3
4

you have ultimately to prove your entitlement, but it

5

would mean that you've got to make a showing that there is

6

a practical reason for stopping this in rem proceeding,

7

and the reason, the justification for that is to avoid the

8

absurd situation in which, simply by claiming that you're

9

part of the world, you could defeat any in rem proceeding.

10

What would be wrong with that rule?

11

MR. RUSCONI:

12

Justice Souter, the problem with

that rule is that by inquiring into the location,

3

inquiring into the issues that you mentioned, you're

4

adjudicating the merits of the claim.

5

QUESTION:

No, I'm simply -- my suggestion was

6

that you've at least got to come forward with a basis for

7

saying, yes, there is a reasonable basis for saying that

8

State interests are involved here, as distinct from the

9

case that would occur if the wreck were beyond the 3-mile

20

limit, or the wreck were in the Gulf of Mexico, or in

21

Europe.

22

And I'm not suggesting that there needs to be a

23

final adjudication, but I'm suggesting that in order to

24

preserve the value of in rem actions there at least ought

25

to be a sufficient showing for the court -- from which the

1

court could conclude that you or your State has a serious

2

interest implicated here that justifies recognizing your

3

Eleventh Amendment claim and, in effect, defeating the

4

Federal in rem action, that's all.

5

MR. RUSCONI:

I understand, Justice Souter, but

6

I do not see as a practical matter how this inquiry that

7

you're talking about about preliminary matters cannot but

8

implicate a question on the merits, and this is what --

QUESTION:

Oh, it implicates it, but it doesn't

10

determine it.

11

with some evidence.

13

and prevail.

14

In other words, you've got to come forward
That's a very different thing from

MR. RUSCONI:

We think that the -- the State of

15

California thinks that the broad concept of sovereign

16

immunity in the Eleventh Amendment means that even the

17

type of preliminary inquiry that you're asking for is

18

forbidden.

19

Now, when a State --

20

QUESTION:

I think I might agree with that, and

21

then suggest that perhaps the Eleventh Amendment doesn't

22

apply at all to an in rem action where the res is not in

23

the custody, the actual custody of the State.

24
25

If you don't accept Justice Souter's lifeline it
seems to me that this shows that perhaps the in -- the

utility of in rem actions is substantially destroyed by

2

your position.
MR. RUSCONI:

3

Well, Your Honor, we don't think

4

we're destroying the utility of in rem actions.

5

has -- this -- there has not been a history of States

6

making unsubstantiated claims based on the Eleventh

7

Amendment, and it's certainly not the case in this case.
QUESTION:

8

9

There

Well, but there is some indication,

isn't there, that when the Framers were drafting the

10

Constitution and when the Eleventh Amendment was adopted

11

that it was thought that certain types of suits in

12

admiralty weren't covered by the Eleventh Amendment at

13

all.

MR. RUSCONI:

QUESTION:

I --

The prize cases, for example -- and

16

very possibly in rem cases of this type, where the State

17

isn't in possession, as such, of the property.
MR. RUSCONI:

18

Your Honor, since the early cases,

19

which we do not believe stand for the citation by the

20

other parties in this case, those cases did not involve in

21

rem actions at all, or possession was not central to the

22

holding.

In this case, title is being -- is going to be

adjudicated against the State in this in rem action.

2

Well, Mr. Rusconi, your opponents

cite the old Peters case from this Court as standing for

the proposition that a Federal court can adjudicate an

5

action so long as the property is not in the possession of

the State.

Peters?
MR. RUSCONI:

9

Now, do you disagree with that reading of

in rem action.

Yes, we do.

That case was not an

That case was an in personam action by

10

rival claimants against the executrices of the estate of

11

the ex State Treasurer.
Now, in that case, when you look at Justice

back and then destroy this ongoing action, that makes

sense.

QUESTION:

What's your answer to The Davis?

As

I recall, you said in your brief, well, Davis isn't on

20

point, or -- here because the title was not involved, but

21

the question is the Eleventh Amendment applicability, and

22

I would suppose that there's an Eleventh Amendment

23

violation or not an Eleventh Amendment violation

regardless.

in The Davis, and that involved -QUESTION:

Well, why should that make a

difference here?

4

MR. RUSCONI:

5

QUESTION:

Because --

Regardless of what's being

6

adjudicated you're saying we have the right to an Eleventh

7

Amendment immunity even though we weren't in possession

8

and even though it is in rem.

9

MR. RUSCONI:

That's correct.

In The Davis the

10

title to the cargo was not at issue, and it also involved

11

the sovereign immunity of the United States, so it's not

2

3

an Eleventh Amendment immunity.
QUESTION:

In this case we have --

No, but if sovereign immunity of the

4

United States would not have prevailed in that case,

5

there's at least a pretty fair argument that it's unlikely

6

that the concept of sovereign immunity recognized in the

7

Eleventh Amendment for State purposes would, in fact, be

8

somehow more powerful or broader.

9

that as a distinction.

20

MR. RUSCONI:

I mean, I don't see

Well, I believe that the cases

21

have diverged on the Eleventh Amendment immunity that is

Do you take the position that State

these are lands that were granted according to the -- by

QUESTION:

Not all property within our jurisdiction is the

You have greater sovereignty over the

sea bed than you have over the dry land in California?

13

MR. RUSCONI:

It is held subject to a public

trust, a unique trust that all sovereign lands in the

State of California are held that are not held, say, on

16

proprietary lands, which may be sold, whereas sovereign

QUESTION:

I don't know where the sovereign

you're going to rely on sovereign lands rather than

you're open to the argument that the reason you've got

those lands is that the Congress of the United States gave

them to you, and if you're going to take the benefit of

3

those lands, presumably it would be fair to say you ought

to take them subject to the burden of taking them without

MR. RUSCONI:

Souter.

the Court was very --

9

This is a difficult case, Justice

However, just last term in the Coeur D'Alene case

QUESTION:

Well, is my -- I -- Coeur D'Alene is

10

fine, but I mean, is there something wrong with the, kind

11

of the equity argument that I just made that if you're

12

going to depend on sovereign lands I think you've got to

13

take the burden as well as the benefit?

14
15
16

MR. RUSCONI:

I don't see what the burden is

here.
QUESTION:

The burden is that you are going to

17

be subject to some incidents of in rem jurisdiction.

18

Maybe that incident is that you're going to lose your

19

title, and you don't have an Eleventh Amendment claim if

20

you're not in possession.

21

you're going to have to make at least a colorable showing

22

that you are in a position at least to claim an interest

23

subject to Eleventh Amendment protection.

Maybe that incident is that

But whatever the burden is, the argument is that

2

them subject to this burden.
MR. RUSCONI:

3

A couple of things.

Yes, but we

4

did not get them under the equal footing doctrine, but why

5

should we be treated any differently by the fact that the

6

lands were conveyed by the Submerged Lands Act when

7

they're adjacent to lands given under the equal footing

8

doctrine?

9

QUESTION:

Well, the reason is that you got this

10

boon out of Congress in 1953, and presumably Congress did

11

not intend to destroy the utility of in rem admiralty

12

actions in the course of doing it.

13

MR. RUSCONI:

That's the answer.

I understand your argument,

14

Justice Souter, but California believes that its title and

15

its regulatory authority transcend questions such as

16

possession.

17

QUESTION:

May I interrupt you with just one

18

question there?

19

they wrote the opinion, but is it not correct that the

20

issues of title and regulatory authority really are quite

21

different, that it might well be true that the in rem

22

action would bind you as to title, but not necessarily as

23

to regulatory control?

24

MR. RUSCONI:

25

I understand the Ninth Circuit -- because

They are different actions.

However, the practical effects of

the application of the rule that we're asking I think, or

8

the State thinks it will be very minimal.
Now, as to bankruptcy, the type of claim which

9
10

is made in bankruptcy under 106 is something that is

11

almost reduced to money.

12

and California acknowledges that in bankruptcy if we do

13

not file a proof of claim under operation of law that debt

14

will be discharged as to the State of California, but a

Yes, but the difference,

MR. RUSCONI:

QUESTION:

I believe --

But it does indicate the practice at

6

that is to bind all of the probable claimants.

7

MR. RUSCONI:

That may have been what Justice

8

Washington was purporting to hold, but again, I think the

9

recent jurisdiction of this Court gets -- has gotten away

10

from the type of formalistic, what pigeon hole does the

on the State.

QUESTION:

But in New York, both of those cases

Why do you think -- just to move on

there, I mean, there's a few other issues in the case.

8

Why do you think this wreck has been abandoned?

9

MR. RUSCONI:

This wreck has been abandoned

10

because under general maritime law as it's developed in

11

this country abandonment can be shown through the passage

12

of time and the failure to salvage on the part of the

13

owner.

14

In this case, we have a claimant who has alleged

claim to one-sixth of the cargo, five-sixths of the cargo

it up, and it's floated to the shore.

MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Although we agree with petitioners that the

11

courts below misconstrued the Abandoned Shipwreck Act, we

12

disagree with them that the Eleventh Amendment applies

13

because this is not a suit against the State.

14

15

Federal court is not necessary to dispossess State agents

16

The Abandoned Shipwreck Act says that if the

18

with respect to that property that falls within the

So at the initiation of the proceeding the court

objection of the State then becomes active, whereas -- and

2

a problem, whereas before we could have displaced it by-

3

saying that historically in rem admiralty jurisdiction is

4

sufficient to bind the State, but once we're in -- within

5

the Federal question jurisdiction the State then makes the

6

argument that the Eleventh Amendment sort of springs back

7

into play?

8

9

MR. FREDERICK:

That becomes a much more

difficult proposition, Justice Kennedy, because what

10

happens in practical effect is that once the State owns it

11

by operation of the Abandoned Shipwreck Act there are

12

other consequences that might flow from admiralty courts'

13

orders, and it might be appropriate at that point for the

14

State to say that the perpetuation and continuation of the

15

suit is in effect an action against the State.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Frederick, do you agree that if

17

the -- if this property were in the possession of the

18

State that the Eleventh Amendment would prevent an in rem

19

adjudication of title?

20

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.

This Court's precedents

21

historically with respect to foreign sovereigns, States,

22

and the United States make clear that the immunity of the

23

sovereign turns on whether its agents are in actual

24

possession or custody of the property that's being

adjudicated, and there were several practical reasons for

that.
The first was that courts recognized that they

2
3

could not issue coercive process against a sovereign's

4

agents to dispossess those agents and create a conflict

5

between the court and the sovereign's agents.
There was also the practical reality that if the

6

7

property wasn't in the possession of the sovereign's

8

agents it likely was not doing the sovereign's work, and

9

so there was a recognition that, as Chief Justice Waite

10

stated while riding on circuit, that the mere fact that a

sovereign claims title to property doesn't make the

MR. FREDERICK:

Justice Ginsburg, when the Court

requisites of immunity and when immunity is appropriate in

and the courts since the Treasure Salvors

17

We concluded that that is not a helpful way of

18

analyzing an immunity question when the sovereign is not

in actual possession of the property, because this Court's

cases uniformly say that when the sovereign is not in

21

possession the colorable claim analysis is really out of

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FLETCHER C. ALFORD

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

13
14

MR. ALFORD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

15

I think it's quite clear that this case is

16

properly before the admiralty jurisdiction of the Federal

17

court.

18

court where such an action could have been brought.

19

Indeed, the Federal admiralty court is the only

This Court has consistently held that admiralty

20

in rem actions against shipwrecked vessels are uniquely

21

and exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Federal

22

courts, and this Court has never held that a sovereign,

23

simply by asserting the claim of ownership to the res in

24

the possession of the court divests the court of its

25

constitutionally mandated exclusive jurisdiction.

1

Rather, this -- a long line of this Court's

2

jurisprudence stands for the proposition that only where

3

the property is within the actual physical possession of

4

the sovereign is the action at that point deemed to be an

5

action against the sovereign itself.

6

Where the property is not in the actual

7

possession of the sovereign, the rule is that the case may

8

go forward and the sovereign, if it wishes to do so, may

9

enter into the suit and assert a claim and prove that

0

claim just like any other claimant in the world.

QUESTION:

You don't want to go the whole hog

and say that in fact there simply is no Eleventh Amendment
applicability to an admiralty in rem action?
MR. ALFORD:

Your Honor, I do not think that is

5

consistent with this Court's cases, and I certainly don't

6

think it's necessary to decide this case.

7

would be appropriate to decide this case on a narrower

8

rule that --

QUESTION:
MR. ALFORD:

I think it

A possession rule.
A possession rule, that's right,

21

Your Honor, and the possession rule has been applied not

22

only to States but also to foreign sovereigns and to the

23

Federal Government and, you know, the question is, why

24

should any different rule apply to the States?

25

QUESTION:

What does the possession rule mean,

strictly speaking?
Supposing there's a State marina with State

3

water police boats in it, and there's an admiralty action

4

brought against -- to adjudicate title in one of those

5

boats, but actually it isn't owned by the State, but it's

6

in this State-owned marina.

7
8

9

Now, would that be in the possession of the
State, or does it have to be actually owned by the State?
MR. ALFORD:

Well, I don't think possession and

10

ownership necessarily have to be equated, Your Honor.

11

think, if I understand Your Honor's hypothetical

12

correctly, this is a situation where a slip in a State-

13

owned marina is leased to a private party.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. ALFORD:

I

Right.
Then certainly in that case the

16

private party would be deemed to be the one in possession

17

of the boat that is in the slip that it has leased from

18

the Government, but --

19

QUESTION:

Well, can I just vary the Chief

20

Justice's question a little?

21

your rule it would be wise, if States want to get control

22

of these abandoned vessels, or sunken vessels, as soon as

23

they hear about it, send the local police out in the

24

appropriate vessels and just take possession, and then let

25

the litigation go forward.

It seems to me that under

Doesn't this -- doesn't your rule encourage

1

2

States to use self help in these situations?
MR. ALFORD:

3

Well, Your Honor, no, I don't think

4

so.

I think our rule encourages States to locate these

5

wrecks if they want to exercise control over them, and I

6

think that's certainly the purpose of the Abandoned

7

Shipwreck also, which was to encourage States to locate

8

these wrecks and, indeed, the Abandoned Shipwreck Act

9

requires States to give public notice of the location of

10

wrecks to which it claims title under the ASA, so I think

11

this encourages States, if they really want to exercise

12

dominion over these wrecks, to at least locate them.

13

That's a fundamental threshold issue, and -QUESTION:

14

But if they had located them, and had

15

sent a diver down affixing a sign saying, claimed by the

16

State, that would be enough for the possession rule, would

17

it?

18

MR. ALFORD:

Well, Your Honor, I think so.

In

19

the Navemar, for instance, in a foreign sovereign

20

immunities context, this Court defined actual possession

21

as some act of physical dominion or control, so at a

22

threshold, certainly the State would need to know where

23

the wreck is located.

24
25

I mean, it's absurd to say that the State has
possession of something and it doesn't even know where

QUESTION:

Well, maybe it doesn't have to send a

It could just go and drop a big rock.

State owns this.

ownership.

Is that the same thing as possession?

2

MR. ALFORD:

3

QUESTION:

4

No, Your Honor.

I think --

I thought possession and an assertion

of ownership are two different things.

5

MR. ALFORD:

They absolutely are, Your Honor,

6

but taking physical -- some act that shows physical

7

dominion over the property I think is possession.
QUESTION:

8

9

Well, why would posting a buoy above

it be an act of possession?
MR. ALFORD:

10

Well, Your Honor, traditionally

11

that's the way that it's indicated in the admiralty law

12

with the case of sunken property.

13

For instance, a salvor, when it locates a

14

shipwreck, often posts a buoy on the site and, in the

15

traditional Federal admiralty law, when the court arrests

16

sunken property it often puts a buoy on the site with the

17

arrest papers on the buoy, so I think by analogy, if the

18

State were to locate the wreck and mark the wreck with its

19

sign in some way, then I think that would be possession.
QUESTION:

20
21

Are you going to talk about the

abandonment issue?
MR. ALFORD:

22

Yes, Your Honor.

The State and the

23

Federal Government suggest that there's some dispute or

24

uncertainty about the definition of abandonment.

disagree.

As Justice Scalia noted, it has to be some type

of voluntary relinquishment of ownership to property.

it's not a voluntary relinquishment, then it's a taking,

QUESTION:

If

Well, can we infer a voluntary

8

relinquishment simply on the basis of insufficient

If somebody else

time is, you've lost it.
MR. ALFORD:

2

That's true, Your Honor, but it's

3

my understanding in those cases that the possession has to

be open and notorious, such that it would give any

5

claimant notice that another person is occupying the

property, and that's certainly not the case here.

I think there's a fundamental distinction --

something.
MR. ALFORD:

You certainly know you've lost

Under your rule, I -- if there has to

be some voluntary act relinquishing all claim of title, I

suppose that no one would ever do that.

the law requires that.

20

MR. ALFORD:

I'm not sure

I agree with Your Honor.

I do not

21

think the law requires any kind of explicit act, and I

22

think the lower courts did not interpret the law in that

manner, but in any event, it requires some evidence of a

voluntary relinquishment of ownership.

to relinquish ownership.
QUESTION:

What about the Park Service that they

two ways at least.

that you never assert any control and, of course, there

they couldn't do it.

the other way was not otherwise indicating a claim, i.e.,

There may be others.

But one way is

The technology wasn't there.

And

you didn't mark it.
And I guess, suppose 100 years passes and nobody

says anything.

13

they could at least announce, you know, put a buoy up or

concerned, are you -- are we trying to find a subjective

of both.

infer from all the facts that the original owner had an

intent to abandon the property.

And so do we look at specific pieces

of property to determine whether that property has been

MR. ALFORD:

Your Honor,

I think it has to be

treated as a whole, particularly under the ASA.

Why?

I mean,

I would think if you

Because if the court finds that

had not been given to potential claimants, and that once

24

notice had been given to the world by publication,

25

claimants might continue to come forward.

QUESTION:

1

How do you read the Ninth Circuit

2

opinion on the abandonment issue?

3

the district court?

4

MR. ALFORD:

Did it go further than

I don't think the Ninth Circuit

5

did, Your Honor.

I think the Ninth Circuit simply

6

affirmed the district court's finding that at that stage

7

of the litigation the district court could not say that

8

the wreck was abandoned because no notice had been given

9

to any potential claimants.
And in fact the district court's judgment in

10

11

this regard has been validated, because potential

12

claimants have continued to come forward since publication

13

of the notice, and it would have been entirely premature

14

at that stage of the litigation for the district court to

15

say that the property was abandoned and therefore cut off

16

all potential claimants.

17

QUESTION:

May I ask you, under your view of

18

abandonment, was the gold in the hull of the ship that was

19

involved in the Treasure Salvors case abandoned by the

20

Spanish?

21

MR. ALFORD:

22

QUESTION:

Your Honor, I -There's no evidence of affirmative,

23

you know, voluntary relinquishment of interest in all that

24

money.

25

MR. ALFORD:

Right.

I don't completely know the

facts of that case, but as I -QUESTION:

2

Well, let me give them to you, then.

A ship is found that went down in

Spain at the time the ship went down.

Was it abandoned,

That's all you know.
MR. ALFORD:

I believe so, Your Honor, because

8

it's my understanding the Government did not come forward

9

after notice in that case.
QUESTION:

10
11

In other words --

The abandonment took place after the

finding of the vessel, then.
MR. ALFORD:

12

Well, the finding of abandonment

3

was appropriate once the court issued notice to the public

4

and no claimants came forward.

5

QUESTION:

No, but I don't -- the word finding

6

was bad.

7

discovery of the vessel.

The time the abandonment occurred was after the

MR. ALFORD:

question, Your Honor.

20

QUESTION:

Is that your view?

I don't know the answer to that
I'm sorry.
It seems to me it's precisely the

21

same situation we have here, except instead of Spanish

22

gold it's American dollars.

23

MR. ALFORD:

Well, the critical difference, Your

24

Honor, is that in Treasure Salvors notice was given to the

25

public and no one came forward claiming ownership.

That

is perhaps
QUESTION:

2

3

But that's almost a default type of

thing rather than abandonment, isn't it?

4

MR. ALFORD:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. ALFORD:

Well, Your Honor -Default of judicial proceedings.
That's true, Your Honor.

I think

7

that abandonment could be found by default in that

8

circumstance.
QUESTION:

9

Well, no.

I'm suggesting that you

10

can have a concept of default in a judicial proceeding,

11

failure to appear and assert a claim, that may have

12

nothing to do with historical abandonment.

13

MR. ALFORD:

That's correct, Your Honor, but I

14

think the issues are related in at least one respect and

15

that is, in a sense, if notice was given to the public and

16

no one comes forward claiming the property, that is, I

17

think, powerful evidence that the property is abandoned.

18

It's not only a legal default, but I think it also goes to

19

evidence of intent to relinquish ownership of the

20

property.

21

No one's come forward to claim it.
QUESTION:

But if we have a rule like the Ninth

22

Circuit rule, which is bothering me, what we do about the

23

Ninth Circuit's statement?

24

Their statement seems to be that if a long time

25

passes, hundreds of years, and nobody does anything, it's

2

Now,

if that's the rule, then I guess once we

announce it you won't have problems with people coming

MR. ALFORD:

That's my

Well, Your Honor, I think the

passage of time in itself, without anything more, is not

5

sufficient to infer abandonment where claimants actually

California speaks in its brief about a

have been sufficient, even though they had done nothing

for 500 years.

MR. ALFORD:

QUESTION:

I just infer this,

No, Your Honor.
And that seems to me a very

extraordinary position.
MR. ALFORD:

No, Your Honor.

The fact that they

simply come forward is not enough in itself to prove not

abandoned -- nonabandonment.

QUESTION:

1

Would it be fair to say that it's

2

your point that the Spanish are not foreclosed unless it

3

has been shown that they affirmatively took some act to

4

abandon?
MR. ALFORD:

5

No, Your Honor.

I don't think

6

abandonment needs to be proven by some affirmative act.

7

It can be proven by inference from the circumstances, and

8

that was certainly recognized by the lower courts here.

9

QUESTION:

Now, if, in fact, this shipwreck was

10

abandoned, if at the bottom line that's the finding, then

your clients are just out, I take it.
They get no salvage rights because the Federal

act eliminates that.

eliminates that.

That's exactly correct, Your Honor,

May I ask just one other question?

Or, I guess, two parts to this.

clear that the term abandoned in this statute has the same

1

Congress assumed that this statute would apply to a lot of

2

sunken vessels, and if we adopt your view of abandonment,

3

it won't apply to any?

4

MR. ALFORD:

Well, Your Honor, on the first

5

question, I think we have to start from the presumption

6

that Congress did not intend to change the fundamental

7

concept of abandonment that has been applied for years

8

both in the common law and in the general maritime law,

9

and indeed that Congress is not free to define abandonment

10

in some way other than as a voluntary process, and there's

11

no evidence, certainly, in the legislative record that

12

Congress intended to depart from the traditional standard

13

of abandonment.

14

Certainly --

QUESTION:

But there is evidence that they

15

thought the statute would apply to a large number of

16

vessels.

17

MR. ALFORD:

18

QUESTION:

19

That's correct, Your Honor.
And I don't think, under your view,

it would apply to any.
MR. ALFORD:

20

Well, I respectfully disagree, Your

21

Honor.

22

certainly the court would be justified in finding, both as

23

a matter of default and as a matter of evidence, that the

24

property is abandoned.

The United States didn't

But suppose that's the case.

Suppose

8

the United States was just sitting there doing nothing

about this, thinking that ship would never be found, but

10

the moment it was found, put in a claim, would you say

11

that the United States, because it had done absolutely

12

nothing, is not claiming that it's done anything -- it

13

abandoned it because it didn't step forward until someone

14

else found the vessel, and then it said, we have stuff on

it.

16

MR. ALFORD:

Your Honor, an inference of

abandonment might well be appropriate in those

circumstances.

would be appropriate.

That's correct, Your Honor.

But you say it's all or nothing, that

the fact that the Federal Government hasn't abandoned the

to look at this as one unit.

that the gold bars belong to the Federal Government and

MR. ALFORD:

Your Honor, I partly agree with

that, and I say partly because it would be inappropriate

for this Court to say that because part of the property on

the wreck is abandoned the whole thing is abandoned.

would constitute a relinquishment of the rights of the
