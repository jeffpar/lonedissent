ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOLLY D. WILKENS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MS. WILKENS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
When this Court denied Thomas Thompson's

11

petition for certiorari on June 2, 1997, his first Federal

12

habeas proceedings became final.

13

any litigation in either the district court or the court

14

of appeals would constitute an impermissible second bite

15

of the apple unless the specific limitations of the

16

Effective Death Penalty Act were met.

17

From that point forward,

It makes no difference if that second bite of

18

the apple occurs upon the motion of the inmate or on the

19

court's own motion.

20

judgment and the State's interest in comity and finality

21

of that judgment --

22

QUESTION:

The adverse effect upon the State's

Ms. Wilkens, what are the limits on a

23

court of appeals' power and authority to recall a mandate

24

sua sponte?

25

to determine that?

Do we know?

I mean, what cases do we look to

MS. WILKENS:

1

Well, first, in distinguishing

2

between an ordinary civil case and a 2254 case I don't

3

perceive any limitations on an ordinary civil case.

4

However --

QUESTION:

Even after a judgment has become

final?
MS. WILKENS:

That's correct, Your Honor.

I

note that there are these standards that have been cited
in the cases that have been cited.

It is a very --

10

apparently a very broad standard.

by-case ad hoc decision with respect to exceptional or

12

extraordinary circumstances.

13

QUESTION:

It's made on a case-

And what do we look to in the case of

14

a habeas proceeding, which we've said is a civil action?

15

What do we look to there?

16

MS. WILKENS:

I would invite the Court to look

17

to the Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 22a, wherein

18

Congress has recently delineated a role for the courts of

1

appeal as a gatekeeper.

20

the original jurisdiction for habeas corpus proceedings

21

from the court of appeals and instead have transferred the

22

screening process that was previously in the district

23

courts, and they have placed that with the court of

24

appeals, thereby significantly --

QUESTION:

They have removed significantly

Antiterrorism and Death Penalty Act speaks to the question

2

of what a court of appeals can do concerning recalling its

3

own mandate?

4
5

MS. WILKENS:

Well, it does not specifically

reference the recall of the mandate.

6

QUESTION:

No.

7

MS. WILKENS:

It most assuredly speaks to

8

finality, and, in fact, section 2244 as amended by the

9

Effective Death Penalty Act is entitled finality,

10

interjects res judicata into habeas corpus, and

11

specifically delineates the narrow circumstances under

12

which additional litigation will occur.

13

QUESTION:

Well, it talks about a second or

14

successive habeas corpus application.

15

Circuit was quite explicit about saying that it was

16

resting just on the previous application.

17

facts.

Once -- it would be if the first

22

petition were final and it becomes final upon the

expiration of time for filing certiorari in this Court or

this Court's denial of certiorari.

1

your answer to an earlier question, there isn't a finality

2

issue under the general rule for civil cases, is that

3

correct?

4

MS. WILKENS:

5

QUESTION:

That's correct.

All right.

Now, why is there a

6

finality rule here, as Justice Kennedy said, a finality

7

rule here when the action is taken, as we will assume that

8

it was, on the court's own motion?
The new statute certainly limits what may be

9
10

done in response to a petition or a request by the habeas

11

petitioner, but how do those provisions enact a, as it

12

were, a finality rule to govern this class of civil cases

13

when there is generally no finality rule and the action is

14

taken by the court on its own motion?

15

MS. WILKENS:

Well, Your Honor, there's

16

precedent for the actions of the court being considered

17

within the confines of the abuse of the writ doctrine.

18

In In re Blodgett the court of appeals was

19

instructed of its duty not to delay habeas corpus

20

proceedings.
QUESTION:

21

Well, but that's a different

22

argument.

If you want to say that there was an abuse of

23

discretion here I think that's quite a substantial

24

argument, but you're talking about first the fact that

25

it's a successive petition barred by the act, and it just

1

seems to me that that's a very, very rigorous reading of

2

the act, that once the mandate issues you can't correct it

3

even if there's no abuse of discretion.

4

argument is that this is a violation of the new act.

MS. WILKENS:

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

And if you want to spend your time on

that, fine.

8

the more substantial claim.

9

Your opening

But it seems to me it's abuse of the writ is

MS. WILKENS:

Well, certainly there are several

10

ways to analyze it, and if this Court does not consider

11

that we have passed into the successive petition area

12

within respect to the Effective Death Penalty Act, most

13

assuredly, as this court was informed by the Effective

14

Death Penalty Act in determining Felker, we do not believe

15

that the Ninth Circuit should be any less informed by the

16

limitations upon relitigating the same claims on the same

17

facts and the same law.

18

QUESTION:

Let me go back a moment to the

19

questions I believe Justice O'Connor asked about the

20

general standard for reviewing, recalling a mandate, or

21

for a court, an appellate court -- are any of those

22

Federal cases, did the recall of the mandate occur after

23

this Court had denied certiorari?

24
25

MS. WILKENS:

I believe there are instances

where that has in fact occurred, Your Honor.

1

QUESTION:

And are they in the brief?

2

MS. WILKENS:

I believe so, and again this

3

unique nature of 2254 cases has been repeatedly recognized

4

by this Court, and most recently, even in the Agostini

5

case, there was a citation to Teague as an express

6

acknowledgement as to the distinctions between

7

rule's ordinary application in the ordinary civil case.

8

9

procedural

The recall-of-the-mandate standard is entirely
too broad to be applied in a habeas corpus proceeding

10

whether it's upon the court's own motion or not.

11

effect upon the State's interest remains the same.

12

QUESTION:

The

I don't understand what AEDPA has to

13

do with this.

14

specifically says at the beginning we're not taking this

15

en banc because of any new evidence, because of anything

16

Thompson did, because of any second or successive claim

17

for relief.

18

is to review a panel en banc if a majority want.

19

I mean, I thought the Ninth Circuit

We're simply doing what we normally do, which

The only unusual aspect of this is the fact that

20

they issued this sua sponte, isn't it?

They issued this

21

sua sponte, this recall of the mandate, so we have an

22

ordinary recall of a mandate case.

23

abuse of discretion, maybe it isn't, but I'm simply

24

adding, I'd like to know why it's an abuse of discretion,

25

because that seems to me to be the issue.

I mean, maybe it's an

MS. WILKENS:

1

Well, it's most assuredly an abuse

2

of discretion, but we need not even reach the traditional

3

abuse of discretion standard because they're applying the

4

wrong standard, because you must turn to the applicable

5

law.

The abuse-of-the-writ doctrine, which has been -QUESTION:

6

In other words, you're saying,

7

suppose a circuit decides in favor of a petitioner, and

8

then we agree to review it, does that have anything to do

9

with AEDPA?

We're just reviewing the initial decision,

10

and why is it any different if a circuit court en banc

11

reviews a panel decision?
MS. WILKENS:

12

13

In a timely manner I would agree

with Your Honor.

14

QUESTION:

All right.

Then the problem is, I

15

take it, that what they did is, they did this later, sua

16

sponte.

17

They recalled the mandate.
MS. WILKENS:

Yes, Your Honor.

Once this Court

18

denied certiorari, the first Federal habeas proceeding

19

came to an end, and --

20

QUESTION:

Ms. Wilkens, who did it sua sponte?

21

This is a question I have in this case.

I'm not sure that

22

Justice Breyer's description fits the panel.

23

the en banc panel, which is not a majority, even, of the

24

entire circuit, decided that it would not take any account

25

of the application and just do the matter sua sponte,

The panel,

right?

2

MS. WILKENS:

3

QUESTION:

4

That's correct, Your Honor.

But how did it get en banc?

It

wasn't the panel that put it in banc.

5

MS. WILKENS:

6

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

It was a vote of the majority of all

7

the judges in active service, as rule, what is it, 35a

8

requires.

9

MS. WILKENS:
QUESTION:

10

Yes.

And that majority of all the active

11

judges, what did they vote to put en banc?

12

question of whether they should sua sponte recall their

13

mandate?

14

MS. WILKENS:

No, Your Honor.

Was it the

It's our position

15

that the full court voted on the question whether or not

16

to reconsider what was before the three-judge panel, and

17

that was Mr. Thompson's motion.

18

QUESTION:

Yes.

So as far as how the thing got

19

to this en banc panel, it was on a decision to respond to

20

a motion by the defendant, who had previously lost the

21

habeas corpus case.

22

MS. WILKENS:

That's correct, and we have

23

questioned how you can rehear something that was not

24

before the three-judge panel.

Is that unusual, too, because isn't

4

That's what I'd like you at some point to

MS. WILKENS:

Yes, Your Honor.

I can only

5

address that by emphasizing that this is a collateral

6

review of a collateral review of a State court decision,

7

and with respect to collaterally reviewing the collateral

8

review, which is the types of unusual circumstances that

9

may be of concern, there is absolutely nothing improper,

10

or even harsh, about limiting the courts of appeals'

11

ability to undertake the types of things that occurred in

12

this case.

13

This is a State court judgment and conviction in

14

a murder case, and it is not akin to a civil litigant who

15

perhaps may be denied access to the Federal court in a

16

trial level or even in the direct appeal.

17

appeal concluded in this case 10 years ago, and it has

18

been collaterally reviewed in State and Federal court

19

since, and any of the unusual circumstances that would

20

ordinarily be of concern should be of no concern at this

21

point in the process.

If we continue to allow such a vague general

23

standard out of concern for the courts of appeals' power,

we are in effect adding an additional layer of review in

8

QUESTION:

I suppose that your position, then,

is not that there is going to be any overall restriction.

10

You don't submit there should be any overall contraction

11

of the authority of a court of appeals to recall its

12

mandate, but that just in the light of the AEDPA, perhaps,

as we said in Felker, informed by that, that it's in those

kind of cases that there would be some restriction.

15

MS. WILKENS:

Yes, Your Honor.

MS. WILKENS:

I think that in the context of

habeas corpus litigation that that is an inappropriate --

13

an inappropriate consideration.

other courts do, you're no different than a habeas corpus

But this was a case where the court

said, yes, we slipped up, there was a lot of carelessness

going on, but the one thing we want you to know is, we are

not entertaining a second habeas.

21

that first one, and it was the court's own sloppiness and

carelessness that takes us back there, and we think that

But you keep saying that we have to bring into

the picture the new legislation.

3

majority was insistent that they were back before the new

legislation, that all they were doing was correcting the

5

mistakes of some of their colleagues, and they were

focusing precisely on the first habeas, nothing after.

MS. WILKENS:

The Ninth Circuit

Your Honor, significantly, it

really matters little in the context of Federal habeas
corpus in the long run as to whether or not this was pre-

10

Effective Death Penalty Act or post-Effective Death

11

Penalty Act, because it would be our position that the

12

abuse-of-the-writ doctrine should also have informed the

13

Ninth Circuit.

14

There have been cases where you do not entertain

15

a 60(b) motion in a district court in a habeas corpus

16

proceeding without considering this Court's doctrines and

17

evolving law in terms of concern for endless repetitive

18

habeas corpus litigation.

1

And with respect to the concerns of the court

20

over its mistakes and the very serious nature of this

21

case, I can only indicate that this Court prior to

22

Congress, and now Congress, has balanced the competing

23

interests of criminal defendants and the State, and they

24

have decided that a mistake by a court of appeal is not

25

sufficient to litigate the same claims on the same facts

QUESTION:

Well, Ms. Wilkens, let me ask you a

3

question here about, suppose we think that the new Federal

4

death penalty act does not mean that a circuit court

5

cannot recall its own mandate.

6

that motion, that it's open to the court to do it.

7

Let's assume we reject

What is the standard for abuse of discretion, if

8

any, that would be applicable in our examination of what

9

the court of appeals in fact does?

Is there any different

10

standard that we apply if the situation is one in which a

11

case has become final, or is it the same standard if it

12

hadn't become final, and what is it?

13

MS. WILKENS:

Your Honor, I believe there must

14

be a distinct standard once the first habeas corpus

15

proceeding has become final, otherwise it is a way to

16

circumvent all of this Court's law controlling --

17

QUESTION:

And do you think that standard should

18

be different in death penalty cases than in ordinary civil

19

cases, or in a criminal case versus -- I mean, a criminal

20

habeas proceeding versus a normal civil case?

21

MS. WILKENS:

22

QUESTION:

23

MS. WILKENS:

Yes, definitely.

And what is the standard?
I would urge this Court to engraft

24

the standard from Congress' enactment of the Effective

25

Death Penalty Act, otherwise a vehicle is left open to

QUESTION:

2

You mean, there's just no authority

3

at all to withdraw the mandate?

4

MS. WILKENS:

5

QUESTION:

The only means by which --

It's very odd for us to say, well

6

now, suppose the AEDPA does not apply, what is the

7

standard for withdrawing a mandate, what is the standard

8

for -- or to determine whether or not there was an abuse

9

of discretion, and you say -- and then you say, AEDPA.

10

Well, that doesn't seem to advance the analysis very much.

11

Isn't it something like miscarriage of justice?
MS. WILKENS:

12

Well, miscarriage of justice has

13

been heightened by the Effective Death Penalty Act, and

14

I --

15

QUESTION:

Well, but if you -- I think what's

16

bothering all of us is that if you import the -- a

17

standard out of the Effective Death Penalty Act, then you

18

are acting on exactly the opposite assumption of Justice

19

O'Connor's questions and all the questions that have been

20

asked.

21

That assumption was that the new act limits what

22

a petitioner can do, but it does not necessarily limit

23

what a court can do on its own motion, and your answer

24

saying, well, you should look to the act for your

25

standard, in effect says it limits the court the same way

it limits the petitioner, and we're assuming that is not

2

the case, and I think there's a good reason, perhaps, to

3

assume that.

4

But isn't it so that, if you simply look to the

5

act, you are really saying the act binds a court just as

if a court were a petitioner?

up?
MS. WILKENS:

Well, the act has made it clear that

14

the interests of the State are being served by limiting

15

what petitioners can do, and now I think you're saying the

16

State's interest in effect cannot be served at all unless

17

you likewise limit what a court sua sponte can do.

18

In fact, if I may just add one thing, you said a

19

moment ago if you don't limit what a court can do you in

20

effect are really destroying the protection of the act,

21

and that, it seems to me, assumes that the court is being

22

disingenuous in a case like this, that it's not really

23

doing what it says sua sponte.

2

should decide this case, then I think we should -- I think

3

you and we should be explicit in talking about it.

4

MS. WILKENS:

Well, Your Honor, I tried not to

5

delineate between disingenuous and well-intentioned with

6

the belief that it's important to preserve the State's

7

interests, and if a recall of a mandate is upon anything

8

less than a miscarriage of justice, whether sua sponte or

9

by the inmate, then the State's interests are not being

10

preserved.
QUESTION:

11

Well, Ms. Wilkens, in our Felker

12

opinion we dealt with several different issues, and one of

13

them was a case where it was not clear whether the AEDPA

14

had restricted our -- the court of jurisdiction of this

15

Court, but we nonetheless said that the exercise of our

16

discretion would be guided by the standards that were made

17

applicable to the lower courts.

18

Can't you make the same argument here, not that

19

the AEDPA flatly controls the action of a court as opposed

20

to the -- sua sponte court as opposed to acting on a

21

motion, but that a court, in exercising its discretion to

22

recall the mandate, has to bear in mind what the AEDPA

23

says?

24
25

MS. WILKENS:

Yes, Your Honor, that would

protect the State's interests.

of where as a circuit we recalled a mandate were things

To follow your line of reasoning,

No, only insofar as Rule 35a is

concerned, which is a very narrowly segregable rule which

10

requires that the en banc vote have the acquiescence, or

11

the affirmative vote of a majority of active judges, and

12

if the issue is whether the Ninth Circuit was considering

13

this sua sponte or rather upon the motion of the

14

petitioner, the only thing the Ninth Circuit did under 35a

15

was to consider it on the motion of the petitioner.

Except that there was the later

18

35a, that was declined by the full court.

MR. LONG:

8

There are a number of points that you

raised in your question.

First of all, it was not simply

10

a mistake by two judges.

The en banc panel sets forth at

11

pages 214 through 216 of the appendix a series of

misunderstandings and mistakes that involve at least six

That's another example, Chief Justice Rehnquist,

QUESTION:

Was that an en banc decision?

MR. LONG:

10

There also is the Nevius case, which I mentioned

earlier, where the circuit declined to recall its mandate

when the purpose was to present new and different claims,

and that's why this case is very different from that, but

Nevius should indicate to this Court that the Ninth

this problem, and so I'd like to hear it.
MR. LONG:

8

Well, I think, Justice Breyer, that

the courts of appeals have struggled with precisely that
10

question over the course of many years, and as one reviews

11

the cases that are set out in notes 17 and 1

12

you see that the courts have come up with certain phrases

13

that they use to describe the process they go through --

14

protecting the integrity of the court's processes, to --

into exactly the problem that you adverted to earlier,

The very fact that they have not done so and that

an indication to me that not only is it impossible to

further cabinet, but it's entirely appropriate that that

6

discretion be left there.

7

Now, having said that, I would concede to you,

8

using your example, that, for instance, if a significant
period of time passed, 10 or 12 years after the mandate

10

was issued, the judgment was issued, a litigant, he or she

11

detrimentally changed his or her position in reliance on

12

that judgment and then the losing litigant were to come

13

back into the court and say, eureka, I have found some

14

idea, I think that you ought to recall the mandate and

15

hear this en banc, perhaps in a situation like that

16

discretion would be exceeded.

17

I would think that the courts of appeals would

18

be entirely capable of seeing that that situation would be

1

an abuse of discretion.

20

QUESTION:

Wouldn't you also look to the effect

21

on the parties, or those generally who rely on the

22

decision, even if the recall were a more prompt one?

23

MR. LONG:

I think that one might, Your Honor,

24

but I don't think that it would be dispositive, certainly

25

not in our case.

QUESTION:

1
2

As a guide, how about the old common

law rule that during the term you could recall a mandate?

3

MR. LONG:

Yes, and that, of course, was set

4

aside in 1948, as Your Honor knows, by statute, and the

5

term limit no longer has anything to do with the ability

6

of the courts of appeals to reach beyond or backward

7

farther and, of course, this Court recognized in Hazel-

8

Atlas that even when the term limit was in place, in

9

certain circumstances, fraud on the court or miscarriage

10

of justice, the court was free to ignore the term limit.

11

QUESTION:

All right, now --

12

QUESTION:

But it might give you some handle on

13

how many -- how long is too long.

14
15

MR. LONG:

It could be certainly a rule of thumb

or a guideline, Your Honor, yes.

16

QUESTION:

You said in response to my question

17

that if we did look to the effect on others, even if a

18

more prompt recall, your case would still turn out

19

favorably to you, and maybe you're right.
Should we consider the fact that the court of

20
21

appeals, before it exercised its sua sponte authority,

22

waited for all of these other bodies to go through various

23

procedures of review?

24

happen.

25

does that cut?

They sat back to see what would

Is that something we should consider, and how

MR. LONG:

Well, certainly it is something

2

before the Court, so it may be something that the Court

3

may wish to consider.

4

what I believe the proper outcome is in this case, for

5

several reasons.

6

QUESTION:

I don't think that it would affect

Yes, but did -- well, because time is

7

short, there's one thing that I wish you would address.

8

Does it go to the seriousness with which we should
consider the claim that they were trying, in effect, to

10
11

protect the integrity of their own procedures?
Because if that had been weighted given a very

12

high weight, wouldn't they have said, we've got to protect

13

the integrity of our own procedures regardless of what all

14

these other courts and executive agencies may be doing,

15

and would it be fair for us to say, the circuit really did

16

not give a very high weight to the integrity of their

17

procedures, and that bears on whether it was an abuse of

18

discretion?

1

MR. LONG:

I don't think that one need

20

necessarily view the facts in that fashion, Justice

21

Souter, the reason being that it appears that there was a

22

discussion between the time the mandate returned to the

23

circuit and was sent to the district court and the time

24

that it was spread.

25

At that point there were proceedings going on in

the State court and, as the opinion points out, for

2

reasons of comity, to use their word, they decided to wait

3

and allow the State court to first address the issues that

4

had been brought to the attention of the State court.

5

It was entirely possible that the California

6

supreme court would have allowed Mr. Thompson a new trial

7

based upon the pleading that was then pending before them.

8

If that were to have occurred, then the Ninth Circuit

9

would not have made -- have needed to make public the

10

rather messy story that is now public, and perhaps that

11

speaks to protecting the integrity of the process as well.

12

I don't know.

I wasn't privy to those

13

conversations.

14

believe in good faith, to return us to the position in

15

which we were before they made these errors, and it was

16

not just the error of two judges misplacing an E-mail, or

17

two clerks not speaking to one another.

18

What I do know is that they attempted, I

If, indeed, they waited too long, that was an

19

error, and in fact that -- the second call after the

20

amended opinion from the panel issued was a timely call

21

under the rules of the court, 5.4.C, and yet the entire

22

court misunderstood the timeliness of that call and no

23

vote was taken.

point, which may have been due partially to the author of

the panel opinion and partially to the en banc coordinator

and how their positions were related to the judge who

called for the en banc --

QUESTION:

It's hard to conceive that wanting to

5

conceal its own ineptitude takes priority over allowing

the State to execute its criminal law.

MR. LONG:
off, Your Honor.

I don't think that was the trade­

I'm merely suggesting -- and I don't

know what the trade-off was, obviously, so I don't want to
10

speak for the Ninth Circuit.

I couldn't.

11

But let us assume that they decided that they

12

would give the court, the supreme court of the State of

13

California, an opportunity to consider the claims that

14

were before it.

15

then the Ninth Circuit would not have had to pursue this

16

course of action, as it did.

17

If that court were to take one action,

There are any number of considerations that

18

would make it advisable for the Ninth Circuit not to have

1

had to go to the lengths that it did go to, which merely

20

underlines for me the seriousness with which they viewed

21

this, and the seriousness with which they viewed their

22

obligation to correct their error to give Mr. Thompson

23

exactly the same right that all others had had to pursue.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:
