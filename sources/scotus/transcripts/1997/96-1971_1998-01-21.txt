ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ODOM

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. ODOM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case, Your Honors, is whether

12

a novel res judicata exception should be engrafted into

13

the settled rules of Federal removal jurisdiction.

14

we address these removal issues, I believe it would be

15

helpful to set out in the nature of the action that we

16

filed in State court below on behalf of these petitioners.

Before

17

Your Honors, my clients loaned $1.3 million in

18

1984 to other sophisticated individuals in a transaction

19

at a time of high interest rates, at an interest rate of

20

20 percent wicn a note and a subsequent mortgage up to an

21

amount of $5 million.

22

mortgage on the real property, or the leasehold estate

2

a hybrid in personam in rem action which is permissible

3

under Louisiana law.

4

It's

There's a second aspect of our claim which is

5

similar but distinct.

That is, a prior bankruptcy

6

proceeding, as the Court is aware, had authorized the

7

respondents in this action or their predecessors in

8

interest to procure cancellation of our lien, which was

9

duly recorded in the conveyance records of Orleans Parish,

10

and it empowered them to do that.

11

court one day in 1986 with the right to have our lien

12

canceled according to the Louisiana lien cancellation

13

procedure.

14

They left bankruptcy

They never took advantage of that right.

The

15

bankruptcy court acknowledged, we take the position, Your

16

Honors, implicitly Louisiana's procedure to have liens

17

cancelled.

18

not only ordered the subject property to be sold free and

19

clear of all liens, it also ordered that the recorder of

20

mortgages erase me liens.

21

It acknowledged a two-step process, because it

This was never done and now, in a footnote, if

you will, to this argument, they've waited too long and

explaining why res judicata won't bar your claim?
MR. ODOM:

Your Honor, I'm just trying to give a

3

little background to the facts, because I feel that -- I

4

feel that it would be important.

5

tangled and I thought it would be good to lay those out.

6

We don't feel it's -- there are a variety of reasons why

7

we don't believe res judicata would bar our claim and

8

those we will all adjudicate below, assuming that it's

9

remanded, of course.

The facts are somewhat

10

Your Honors, it's important to remember in that

11

connection that two of the four persons that we sued were

12

not even present in the bankruptcy proceeding, and two of

13

our four petitioners did not appear in the bankruptcy

14

proceeding and received absolutely no notice of it.

15

We claim against these two - -

16

QUESTION:

May I ask, does that have anything to

17

do with any issue except whether there's estoppel here?

18

I'm just a little puzzled why we have to get into the

19

facts in this case.

20

MR. ODOM:

Your Honor, it's important for us, we

21

believe, to show the Court exactly how far this doctrine

22

will go if a res judicata exception is carved out on the

23

facts of this case and, that being so, you would have to

24

see that this is not even a proper res judicata situation,

25

because two of the four persons were not even -- two of

1

the four persons we sued were not even a part of the

2

bankruptcy proceeding.
Therefore, my point in bringing these to the

3
4

Court's attention, Your Honor, is, look at how far this

5

goes.

6

claim that a bankruptcy procedure has affected in any way

7

someone, or that person's privity and interest in any way,

8

or that can be alleged, that's going to be brought up by

9

defendants as a res judicata exception.

Where it's going is, if you have any part of a

10

to be a complete res judicata exception.

11

wasn't in this case.

12

QUESTION:

It doesn't have
Indeed, it

But your point, as I understand your

13

brief, is that even a narrow res judicata exception should

14

not be recognized.

15

MR. ODOM:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

So you're just saying this is the

17

parade of horribles.

down the slippery slope.

MR. ODOM:

If we take the first step, we go

Yes, sir.

That's exactly what I'm

trying to suggest.
And Your Honor -- well, we believe that the

22

opinions below were not even internally consistent, if you

23

will, in that connection, because they likened their new

24

jurisdictional basis to -- of complete preclusion to

25

complete preemption, but complete preemption, as this

1

Court has stated over and over again, really means

2

complete preemption.
It means that Congress has so thoroughly

3
4

occupied a whole field of the law that any State law claim

5

is really a Federal claim, but here complete preclusion,

6

as they use it, is not complete because this State action

7

was not completely precluded by res judicata.
To show just how far it goes, Your Honor, not

8

9

only did the district court below decide the case on the

10

merits, decide that there was no claim there, that the

11

plaintiffs were dead, if you will, and use that as a basis

12

for removal jurisdiction, he then used that removal

13

jurisdiction to get supplemental jurisdiction over the two

14

parties who were not involved in the res judicata aspect,

15

and so what we have is the decision on the merits that the

16

claim was completely precluded being used as justification

17

to assert supplemental jurisdiction over parties whose

18

claim -- against whose claims we did not have a completely

19

precluded claim, so it really is not even internally

20

consistent and it does show, if you will, the parade or

21

horribles.

22

But fundamentally, Your Honors, as we've stated

23

in our brief, res judicata is an affirmative defense and

24

removal cannot be based on an affirmative defense.

25

codified in the statute, it's been reconfirmed many times

Caterpillar, and by Oklahoma Tax Commission --

QUESTION:

And I take it if we adopted your

4

position we could leave intact the doctrine that

5

originated in Avco v. Aero Lodge, the preemptive -- the

6

preemption doctrine.

7

MR. ODOM:

Yes, Your Honor.

We don't urge an - -

8

that the preemption doctrine has to be overruled.

9

now so firmly in - - fixed in the jurisprudence of this

-0

Court that we believe that it has worked well.

11

It doesn't have to be overruled.

12

That is

It's fine.

But the Court has been very careful about

13

articulating any further exceptions to the well-pleaded

14

complaint rule if the Avco doctrine be an exception.

15

know there's academic dispute about that.

16

I

What is clear with respect to the facts of this

17

case is that, even if the affirmative defense, the Federal

18

affirmative defense is the only real issue in the case,

19

even if it is absolutely dispositive of the merits and is

20

the only thing Lnat has to be decided below, it cannot be

21

used as a basis for Federal removal jurisdiction.

22

Now, there is nothing special about the res

23

judicata affirmative defense as opposed to any other

24

affirmative defenses that might be raised by someone below

25

as a justification for removing a case to Federal court.

Indeed, Your Honors -QUESTION:

2

Well, they could be to the extent the

3

Anti-Injunction Act makes an exception, the relitigation

4

exception.

5

about relitigating a case that was resolved in Federal

6

court.

7

That does show that there is something special

MR. ODOM:

Your Honor, that does show that

8

Congress has recognized the relitigation situation, has

9

addressed it in the appropriate way after full

10

consideration, and has crafted the relitigation exception

11

to section 2283.

12

removal based upon res judicata, because, as this Court's

13

ruling in Chick Kam Choo makes clear, the 2283

14

relitigation exception to the Anti-Injunction Act is

15

narrower than the full range of res judicata.

16

That is a different remedy, though, than

It also is an equitable proceeding, and the

17

Court does not have to enjoin a State court from

18

relitigating something that's previously been decided.

19

The Court can take full cognizance of all the facts and

20

circumstances, the equitable arguments on both sides.

21

dare say if that exception had been applied in this case

22

there are equities on both sides of this case that would

23

need to have been considered.

QUESTION:

Your claim, leaving aside the

bankruptcy, is wholly State in origin.

argument to it, is there?
MR. ODOM:

6

There's no Federal

That's absolutely correct, Your

7

Honor.

In fact, in trying to cast in my own mind as to

8

whether there would be any conceivable way that our claim

9

could be recharacterized as a Federal claim, I can't

10

imagine how our claim could have been recharacterized on

11

the face of the pleadings or any other way so as to state

12

a Federal cause of action.
There is no general Federal law of mortgages

strongly that this cannot be cast as an artful pleading

Even if the statute and the jurisprudence of the

1
2

Court allowed us to plead on the face of our pleadings an

3

affirmative defense to somehow get ourselves into Federal

4

court, I don't see how it could have been recast in an

5

artful way as a Federal affirmative defense, so it's an

6

entirely State law cause of action, something that we

7

could not have brought in Federal court.
The res judicata issue that they try to bring us

8

9

in on removal is something that we did not bring -- it's

10

somebody else's bankruptcy.

11

simple situation where A sues B in Federal court and loses

12

and then A goes back down to Federal court, to State court

13

and brings the identical claim in State court leaving out

14

one or two words.

It's a very far cry from the

other defenses, other affirmative defenses might not be as

2

worthy, but the Court has already spoken to that.
Indeed, Your Honors, any given application of

3
4

res judicata is likely to be less significant than any

5

given application of the tribal immunity defense, because

6

tribal immunity is the result of a solemn treaty between

7

the Congress of the United States and a sovereign Indian

nation.

QUESTION:

2

3

What do you do with the footnote in

our Moitie case, Mr. Odom?

4

MR. ODOM:

Your Honor, the more one reads

5

Moitie, the more difficult it is to see how so many people

6

became convinced that this Court was articulating a new

7

theory of removal jurisdiction based on res judicata.

8

such theory is mentioned in footnote 2 or anywhere else.

9

Justice Brennan's vigorous dissent which everyone cites

10

doesn't even address that.

11

about a res judicata defense.

12

preemption aspect of it and the antitrust aspects.

No

It doesn't mention anything
It addresses only the

13

The -- if you consider the language employed by

14

the Court in the Moitie footnote, the Court defers to the

15

factual findings by the district court below and notes

16

that at least some of those claims were sufficiently

17

Federal in character to support removal jurisdiction, at

18

least some of the claims.

1

there had been some intention to highlight this aspect of

2

the law of res judicata, it would have been mentioned.

3

And Your Honors, the Court in Moitie, this Court

4

actually remanded the issue of res judicata to the court

5

of appeals to decide, stating that it was "unnecessary for

6

the Court to reach that issue."

7

But if the Court in Moitie had been using

8

complete preclusion, res judicata as its ground for

9

removal jurisdiction, then the res judicata issue would

10

already have been decided.

12

There would have been nothing to send back.

QUESTION:

There wouldn't have been

Well, what made the case -- what was

14

the Federal character of the claim, as distinguished from

15

the preclusion defense?

16

MR. ODOM:

Your Honors, it's clear from reading

17

the Moitie opinion and the opinions below that the

18

sufficient Federal -- sufficiently Federal character of

19

the claims brought in State court was an intent to rely on

20

Federal law, an intent to really state Federal claims in

21

State law disguise.

22

This becomes crystal clear when one looks at the

23

unreported district court opinion which, Your Honor, I

24

confess I did not do until last week, when I came and

25

looked at your archives upstairs, but it's in there on the

third floor.
The district court's opinion below makes it

2

3

absolutely clear that the second complaint, filed after

4

the Federal complaint was dismissed, was identical in

5

every respect to the Federal claim that had been there.

6

Indeed, in oral argument it was made plain that the only

7

word that was changed in the second complaint was the word

8

antitrust.
The Court -- the discussion of that which makes

9
10

it very clear, two-paragraph discussion, is found at pages

11

16a and 17a of Judge Spencer Williams' June 30, 1977

12

opinion below.
The -- the -- and also makes it clear that the

13
14

State law plaintiffs had pleaded identical words from the

15

Government's civil claim and the Government's criminal

16

claim, criminal action, two separate Federal actions.

17

They had initially -- they had initially

Then

1

they went back to State court, restated their complaint

2

identically word for word, leaving out the word antitrust

3

and copying the Federal pleadings of the Federal civil

4

action and the Federal criminal action.
It is simply -- it is simply an application of

5
6

the artful pleading doctrine in the antitrust context, and

7

there's every reason to believe, as we set out in our

brief, that that's exactly what it was.

14

QUESTION:

While --

What did they -- I'm somewhat

15

curious.

I take it that the Browns' original Federal

claim said the defendants had done something that violated

the antitrust -- the Federal antitrust laws.

18

MR. ODOM:

QUESTION:

Then they left out the word

15

MR. ODOM:

Well, the artful pleading doctrine,

16

Your Honor, exists for situations where the claim can be

17

recharacterized as a Federal claim and I believe, on a

18

straightforward basis, that's what the judge in the Moitie

19

case did and that is what this Court was doing in saying

20

that at least some of those claims were sufficiently

21

Federal in character to support removal jurisdiction.

22

But in any event, it had nothing to do with the

23

law of res judicata or carving out a new exception whereby

24

an affirmative defense itself could be the basis for

25

jurisdiction.

What the district court did in that case was, in

fact, accepted jurisdiction on the basis of the

3

recharacterization of Federal claims and then, having

4

acquired jurisdiction, dismissed those claims due to res

There was no linkage of res judicata to

jurisdiction in the case anywhere along the line,

jurisdiction by reference to res judicata.

There was no effort to establish
They did not

accept jurisdiction because the claim was being dismissed

on the basis of res judicata, and that's the odd conundrum

12

that we articulated as issue 2 in our questions presented.

13

The Court in this case decided, made a decision

14

on the merits and decided that the claim was completely

destroyed and used that decision on the merits to justify

having jurisdiction in the case.

In that case the judge literally drew

it's -- the way I explain it, Your Honor, is that it's

points that out.
On its face, Moitie had only State causes of

The argument here -- in that instance the

recharacterization was that there was a Federal cause of

that the petitioners are in effect taking either an out-

It seems extraordinarily unlikely that

2

they would file what was really a 60(b) motion appended to

3

an earlier Federal action and file that in the State

court.
MR. STERN:

5

Well, but that's the whole point of

6

the artful pleading doctrine, is that you try to disguise

7

what is, in effect, a Federal claim.
If you look at what they say the State court

8

9

should have reviewed, what the State court has to do is

10

essentially sit in review on what the bankruptcy court

11

did.

QUESTION:

But it seems to me you're expanding

13

the artful pleading doctrine a good ways with your

submission.

One of the things that makes this case a little

believe, once you look underneath it, is the fact that in

something that's going to happen and what they're seeking

to do is have a State court sit in review of the propriety

of the order issued by the court simply by saying I'm

But are you saying that any time a

plaintiff in State court, perhaps without legal

justification, files an action which would require the

State court to review some previous proceeding in Federal

court, that that is automatically removable?

(Laughter.)

4

MR. STERN:

There is a danger in reading too

5

much into Moitie, into the footnote, but I think at a

6

minimum what it stands for is recognition by the Court

7

that there is such a thing as artful pleading.

8

that much, it seems to me, is clear from the footnote and,

9

secondly, that the doctrine of artful pleading is going to

10
11

I mean,

expand to some extent beyond the preemption cases.
QUESTION:

Well, if you're right about that and

12

that artful pleading consists of bringing a cause of

13

action to which there is a defense that a Federal --a

14

prior Federal case gives a res judicata defense, then what

15

would follow is not only you can remove it, but that State

16

law claim to which there is a possible Federal res

17

judicata defense can be brought originally in Federal

court, so any State law claim, you know, how clear does

the Federal bankruptcy defense or the other Federal res

in the Fifth Circuit was clear, and there was a ruling by

MR. STERN:

Oh, clear, but they say -It was clear for purposes of what we

were doing.

I mean, the fact is, of course, we're up

MR. STERN:

Let me answer that in two stages,

3

because to some extent the initial part of your question

4

deals with whether the artful pleading should apply even

5

in preemption cases.

6

I mean, in a preemption case there is a State

7

law claim being asserted -- Avco, Franchise Tax Board, and

8

so forth - - yet in two of the four preemption cases the

9

Court has said, despite what it appears to be, it is, in

10

fact, a Federal claim and that requires delving into what

11

the substance of the action is, delving into Federal

preemption law and getting into all sorts of --

Mr. Stern, let's slice of one part of

It isn't the kind of defense that a court raises on its

MR. STERN:

Well, there are two sets of

nonparties we're dealing with here.

There is the issue of

10

two of Mr. Odom's clients who were wives of the two people

11

who were clearly represented in the bankruptcy, according

12

to the text of the bankruptcy court order, and the answer

to that is, yes, I think they do if they are considered

abstract as to parties who were not privy to a prior

MR. STERN:

Then I think that under those

circumstances the answer would probably be no.

point, you are far enough away from someone who is bound

by what happened in bankruptcy court that you would have

to stay in State court at that point.

Celotex v. Edwards didn't involve

the merits, but that's a question that the State courts

are entitled to decide in the first instance and it could

be reviewed here if you think they decided wrongly.
MR. STERN:

There's no question that if we had

12

wanted to have the State court review it, the State court

13

had the power to review it and I agree with Mr. Odom that

14

that review would have had to be conducted pursuant to

15

Federal law, Federal law of res judicata, because it's a

16

Federal judgment that is being interpreted.

17

The issue before you, though, is whether that's

the only way that you could go.

that had the supersedeas bond in front of it had the power

I simply wanted to use
