ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

We'll go on to Number

MR. FERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
It has been said that the principles which guide

11

this Court's habeas corpus jurisprudence are finality,

12

federalism, and fairness.

13

own assessment of those principles and recalibrated the

14

instrument of statutory habeas corpus in the Antiterrorism

15

and Effective Death Penalty’Act, so now there is a fourth

16

principle which might be called fidelity which must be

17

applied here, by which I mean that this Court, as the

18

supervisor of the lower Federal court system, must ensure

19

that the lower courts are faithfully applying the plain

20

meaning and clear intent of that act.

21

In 1996, Congress conducted its

It is critical to read this statute on its own

22

terms, because we sometimes find that we have in effect

23

new wine in old bottles, the same concepts but with new

24

meaning and, therefore, we have to read the statute very,

25

very carefully to understand what exactly it is that

Congress was doing.

2

QUESTION:

Well, do you think that Congress may

3

have been trying to tighten up the court's abuse of the

4

writ standards in passing AEDPA?
MR. FERG:

5

Yes, Your Honor.

As a matter of

6

fact, as I pointed out, the way 2244 has been modified

7

simply expunges the concept of abuse of the writ, so that

8

we now have in effect some very clear designations of what

9

is a successive petition and this kind of amorphous

10
11

concept -QUESTION:

Before we had AEDPA, did courts, do

12

you think, apply abuse of the writ standards to Ford

13

claims at all?

14

MR. FERG:

No, Your Honor.

15

QUESTION:

I don't think they did.

A Ford claim

16

is a little different, since it seems to arise later after

17

the conviction and the sentence and relate to a

18

defendant's mental condition at the time of a scheduled

19

execution, so it wasn't the kind of application that

20

triggered abuse of the writ analysis before AEDPA, was it?

21

MR. FERG:

Well, yes and no.

The lower courts

22

did not address that, but this Court in Woodard v.

23

Hutchins did deal with a contention that the individual

24

was currently insane as he was approaching execution.

25

QUESTION:

Mm-hmm.

MR. FERG:

2

here that that was,

3

to abuse of the writ analysis, and so even before AEDPA

4

there had been the indication that in fact that kind of a

5

claim might well be -QUESTION:

6

And it was indicated by five justices
in fact,

a contention that was subject

What do you think we do post-AEDPA

7

with claims that really arise later,

8

arising out of the establishment of good time credits or

9

something of that sort?

such as claims

What do we do?

Do we say that

10

that's a successive application for habeas if the thing

11

couldn't even have been raised until good time credits

12

were denied?

13
14
15

MR. FERG:

It may well be.

The reason for

QUESTION:

Is that the position you take,

that -that

16

AEDPA goes that far and that it extends to even those

17

things that could not have arisen before --

18

MR. FERG:

Yes, Your Honor.

19

QUESTION:

-- the claim was made?

20

MR. FERG:

Because of the plain language of that

21

second exception --

22

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.

23

MR. FERG:

-- which says that if it is a matter

24

which you could not have brought the facts forward before,

25

nonetheless,

if it does not go to guilt-innocence

1

determinations, then it's excluded.
QUESTION:

2

How about a Rose v. Lundy problem?

3

An applicant comes in with several claims on Federal

4

habeas and the district court says, well, you didn't

5

exhaust in State court some of these.

6

dismiss everything and send you back.

7
8

I'm going to

Now, if a second habeas is then filed, you would
say AEDPA bars that there?
MR. FERG:

9

We have to distinguish your

10

hypothetical as one where the entire petition was

11

dismissed.

12

QUESTION:

Mm-hmm, yes.

3

MR. FERG:

And our position is in that situation

4
5

it is in effect not an application which is meaningful.
However, this case was a situation where there

6

was a first petition, where 30 claims were adjudicated on

7

the merits or preclusion basis to the end, and therefore

8

what we're suggesting is that although 2254 has also been

9

modified, particularly so that it is no longer necessary

20

as under Rose to mandatorily dismiss, but the effect for a

21

case where there has been an application where there has

22

been progress to an adjudication of some of those claims

23

on the merits --

24
25

QUESTION:

Was the Ford claim made in the

petitioner's first petition?

1

MR. FERG:

It was, and found not ripe.

2

QUESTION:

And the Federal court said no, we

3

can't deal with this now.

4

MR. FERG:

That's correct.

5

QUESTION:

But we'll deal with it later.

6

MR. FERG:

That was the anticipation, yes.

7

QUESTION:

Are you saying that that

8

determination should have been appealed, i.e., he should

9

have said yes, it is ripe?

10

MR. FERG:

Well, as a matter of fact that

11

question was raised in the Ninth Circuit and they agreed

12

that that particular claim was properly dismissed as being

13

premature, because there was no warrant for execution.

14

was years before the likelihood of an execution actually

15

taking place.

It

16

QUESTION:

So what more could he have done?

17

MR. FERG:

Under pre-AEDPA he did what he could,

18

and I want to emphasize that this is not a situation where

19

the State somehow inveigled him, or mouse-trapped him.

20

certainly didn't know 3 years in advance that AEDPA was

21

going to be passed.

22

We

The law was changed as this case progressed, and

23

so in effect Congress said this no longer is the kind of

24

claim which ought to be heard in Federal district courts,

25

much like they came back in 1868 and said, we are going to

1

withdraw habeas appellate jurisdiction from this Court,

2

and no more than Mr. McCardle had a justiciable interest

3

after that, so Mr. Martinez Villareal no longer has an

4

interest that can be presented at least in district -QUESTION:

5

In view of your answer about

6

exhaustion, failure to exhaust, so it's dismissed, and

7

then it comes back after AEDPA, and you said effectively

8

that would not be a successive petition, suppose the Ford
claim were the only claim brought up in the first habeas,

10

and the district court says, it's not ripe, you get a

11

competency hearing in the State court -- it's so close to

12

exhaustion.
So your original answer was, but this person had

13
14

other claims that were adjudicated.

15

MR. FERG:

Right.

16

QUESTION:

Suppose it had been only the Ford

MR. FERG:

If it were exclusively the Ford claim

17

claim.

18
1

and it had been dismissed at that point, then we would not

20

consider that a successive application, because there had

21

been no determination on any merits issue.
QUESTION:

22

23
24
25

Well, except that -- yes, there was a

decision.
You say, well, it may not be successive.

It

sure is second, because there was a first one and this is

1

a second one, so it seems to me that if we're going to

2

read the statute in that sort of -- taking the terminology

3

on its face, I don't see why your answer hasn't got to be

4

the opposite of what you gave.

5

MR. FERG:

Because we are giving meaning to

6

every word in the statute, including application.

7

does it mean to have a meaningful application?

8

to be something that the courts can rule on.

What

It's got

9

For example, there are cases out of the Seventh

10

Circuit which say, if this petition is dismissed for lack

11

of a filing fee, or failure to submit the proper

12

affidavits and so forth, then we're not going to treat it

13

as successive and that's appropriate, because in effect

14

the court is saying, this is a nothing.

15

to do anything with it.

16

17

We're not going

But in this case, we had years of litigation,
evidentiary hearings, and determination of 30 issues.

18

QUESTION:

But suppose --

19

QUESTION:

You think the case we just heard was

20

a nothing, because that also involved sort of a ripeness

21

question, which is the same kind of a question as a -- as

22

the timeliness of the challenge to a competency hearing.

23

MR. FERG:

Well --

24

QUESTION:

I wouldn't call that case a nothing.

25

I mean, there was a lot of argument about whether, indeed,

1

it was timely or not.
MR. FERG:

2

3

Well, sometimes there is much ado

about nothing.

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. FERG:

In this particular situation, though,

6

all that the State did was point out what the district

7

court probably would have noticed on its own, which is

8

that if you do not have a ripe issue you do not have

9

Article III justiciability.
You've got to have a cause that the court can

10
11

deal with and if there simply isn't, at that point, a

12

meaningful possibility that you are going to be executed,

13

you don't have something that you can present at that --

14

QUESTION:

Let me ask you another question.

Do

15

you think that a so-called Ford claim, somebody who says,

16

I'm not mentally competent to be executed, could be raised

17

under section 1983 rather than habeas?

18

MR. FERG:

No, ma'am, I don't believe it can,

20

QUESTION:

Why not?

21

MR. FERG:

Congress, which, of course, is the

19

because --

22

author of both of these remedial schemes, if you will,

23

has,

24

capital punishment and capital sentences is to be

25

litigated by way of habeas.

I think, made it clear that everything to do with

1

For example, in 21 U.S.C. 848(q), where they

2

talk about the funding statute and it says, this is the

3

way that you do it, you fund lawyers to bring sections

4

under 2254 and 2255 for all kinds of things,

5

competency determinations.

6

QUESTION:

including

Well, except this person is not

7

before the courts arguing that he is being held in

8

violation of Federal law.

9

executed without a determination of my mental capacity.

10

MR. FERG:

He just says, I can't be

Well, what this Court indicated in

11

Gomez v. U.S. District Court is that section 1983 is not a

12

device to circumvent rules against successive petitions.

13

In that case it was a McCleskey type of situation, but

14

because 1983 --

15

QUESTION:

I don't know that it's a

16

circumvention.

17

habeas relief fits this type of claim.

18

I'm trying to find out if traditional

MR. FERG:

Well, to the extent that Congress has

19

indicated this is the way it should go, particularly by

20

the addition of Chapter 154 --

21

QUESTION:

We've used habeas for all sorts of

22

matters relating to the propriety of execution, haven't

23

we, whether it's cruel and unusual punishment, whether

24

certain procedures have to be used, and that doesn't

25

relate to the detention of the individual.

1

MR. FERG:

That's correct.

2

QUESTION:

I sort of favor using habeas for what

3

it ought to be used’ for, but I think we crossed that

4

bridge a long time ago.

5
6

MR. FERG:

Well, in effect I would suggest that

this Court has determined this question already.

7

QUESTION:

But if that's so -- if that's so,

8

then isn't what's before the Court not -- he's not

9

challenging his underlying conviction, and he's not

10

challenging the sentence he got.
He's challenging now in the Federal court

11
12

something different, which is the competency adjudication

13

in the State court.

14

see how that's successive of anything that was focusing on

15

the conviction and the sentence instead of the competency

16

determination.

17
18

MR. FERG:

That's a different target.

I don't

The application is successive because

it is the second time he has come to the court.
QUESTION:

19

But you've already told me that you

20

don't take that so formally that in dealing with the

21

dismissed case because of exhaustion for -- that

22

technically that's a second -- it's the second time he's

23

filed.

24
25

I don't understand why those two would be
different, if you say, and he has never before attacked

1

the determination that was just made in the Arizona State

2

court that he is competent, that was just made last week.

3

Why isn't that not successive?

4

MR. FERG:

It is successive because it goes

5

ultimately to that very same sentence that was imposed

6

upon him in the first place, and therefore he is coming a

7

second time to in effect get a Federal court to say, you

8

cannot execute this person.

9

QUESTION:

Is there any reason to think that

10

Congress wanted the result that Justice Ginsburg is

11

discussing?

12

I mean, is there any reason to think that

13

Congress somehow wanted to take this unusual set of claims

14

that arise only, and can by their very nature arise only

15

well after the trial itself, that have nothing to do with

16

the trial, that have nothing to do with the appeals -- it

17

would be a claim, for example, saying we're going to

18

torture someone to death, or I mean, you know, some

19

frightful thing, think of some awful thing, and it could

20

never have arisen before.

21

I mean, is there any reason Congress would have

22

wanted to bar habeas totally from such a claim?

23

think of one, and if there is none, and no evidence they

24

wanted to, can't you just read a claim not to include that

25

kind of claim?

I can't

MR. FERG:

1

Okay, two answers to that.

First of

2

all, my reading of the legislative history does not show

3

that they specifically looked at the narrow issue of

4

competency for execution, but what they did do is, in

5

drafting their exceptions, made it very clear that it was

6

not to do with any issue of sentencing but only of built-

7

innocence, and as far as the torture, breaking on the

8

wheel, that is what direct search is for.

9

always --

10

QUESTION:

You're

I thought your answer was going to be

11

simply section 2244(b)(2)(B), which makes it very clear

12

that the mere fact that something couldn't have been

13

raised earlier, because the factual predicate did not

14

exist, is not alone enough.

15

clear that that's not enough.

16

MR. FERG:

Exactly.

17

QUESTION:

In addition to that, the fact --

I mean, that makes it very

That says --

18

those new facts have to show that the defendant was

19

innocent of the underlying offense.

20
21

22

MR. FERG:

That's essentially what I was trying

to get at, that this is the plain meaning of the statute.
QUESTION:

If you're trying to get at that, I

23

was talking about a claim that not only couldn't have been

24

raised earlier, but one that had nothing to do with the

25

trial or the appeal process.

1

It had nothing to do with the trial itself.

It

2

had nothing to do with the jury, that it's totally beside

3

the point whether a jury would or would not have thought

4

the person was innocent.

5
6

7

In other words, all those things in (b)(2) just have
nothing to do with this kind of thing.
MR. FERG:

If it is something which relates to

8

the determination of guilt or innocence, yes, then that

9

would be permissible, assuming that, again, there were

10
11

some newly discovered facts.
QUESTION:

May I ask -- maybe I'm going to pose

12

the same kind of question that's been posed before, but

13

let me pose it in a slightly different way.

14

start with an assumption which I think you do not share,

15

and that is that even you do not read second and

16

successive in a literal way, and I realize you think you

17

do, but I start with the premise that you don't.

I'm going to

18

MR. FERG:

Okay.

19

QUESTION:

If that's what I assume to begin

20

with, then I'm faced with the following kind of question:

21

Why would Congress have wanted to draw a

22

distinction between the jurisdiction of a court to

23

entertain a competency claim based upon what seems to be

24

the totally capricious circumstance that it was or was not

25

joined in the first instance with some other claims?
15

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

This seems to me a very difficult question when

1

2

one accepts, as I think we both do, the premise that the

3

claim does have to be ripe, and you can't come in the week

4

after conviction, when you don't know when you're going to

5

be executed and say, well, I'm not competent to be

6

executed.

7

If we do not start with the premise that the

8

terms literally mean what they mean and have got to be

9

applied in that way right down the line, why would it not

10

be sensible to say, Congress surely would not have

11

intended to cover this rather -- or to mandate this rather

12

capricious distinction and hence throw this fellow out of

13

the Federal court?
MR. FERG:

14

What's the answer to that?
Well, I would suggest that it would

15

not be capricious at all, because in effect what we're

16

finding here is that t he individual is going to have

17

virtually the same kind of review that he would have had

18

without AEDPA, because competency is a factual matter, and

19

for example in Demosthenes v. Baal and Maggio v. Fulford

20

this Court made very clear that, even without AEDPA,

21

there's a factual issue which the courts, the Federal

22

courts must defer to, and so this Court on --

23

QUESTION:

Well, that doesn't go to the

24

jurisdiction of the Federal court ultimately to entertain

25

the claim.

MR. FERG:

1

What I'm saying, though, is that it

2

is consistent to say that this is an appropriate way to

3

limit the kinds of issues that are going to come in front

4

of the district court, which doesn't drastically -QUESTION:

5

But it doesn't -- I have the same

6

question as Justice Souter.

You have two cases.

One

7

case, all he does is bring a competency -- a claim that

8

he's incompetent to be executed.

9

MR. FERG:

Right.

10

QUESTION:

That's all he brings, and the State

11

comes rushing in and says, premature, and it's dismissed.

12

It's premature, not ripe.

13
14

Case number 1.

Case number 2, different defendant, he's got 30
claims, and he adds the competency claim.
Why should those cases come out differently?

15
16

case number 1 you're going to be able to hear the claim

later.

Case number 2, you're not.

That just makes no

And I think that was the substance of Justice
Souter's question, and I don't think you've answered it.
MR. FERG:

Well, I think the bottom line is it's

22

a choice that Congress is entitled to make, that we are

23

dealing with a statute -- this is where the entitlement

24

comes from, that it is a statute which Congress can say,

25

we will allow the courts to hear certain types of claims,

1

just as this Court said, we're not going to let you hear

2

Fourth Amendment claims any more.
QUESTION:

3

well, if Congress had said that in

4

any direct way, you'd be well on the road to your

5

argument, but you're basically saying -- in fact, you said

6

literally a few moments ago, this is just like McCardle.

7

It's not like McCardle.

There was no question

8

about what Congress was intending to do and literally

9

clearly did do in the statute that was at issue there.
Here, we -- if we accept your position we are

10
11

saying that for all practical purposes, in any case in

12

which there's more than one possible claim on habeas,

13

Congress has, without ever expressing directly the

14

question of this subject matter jurisdiction point,

15

indirectly ruled out the subject of competency claims for

16

Federal courts.
This isn't straightforward like McCardle.

17

It's

18

exactly the opposite, and it would attribute to Congress

19

either a very strange inadvertence, since Ford claims are

20

well-known, or a rather underhanded way of doing business,

21

which we just don't --we don't attribute that to

22

Congress.

23

That isn't the way we assume they work.
MR. FERG:

Well, I have to disagree with you on

24

that, because this Court has repeatedly made clear, for

there are other cases which show you don't have to find

that Congress --

MR. FERG:

-- we're back to plain meaning again,

10

not agree entirely on that, but if we don't think that a

11

simple, literal plain meaning analysis is going to be

12

applicable here because of exactly the case that you

13

concede would be allowed as a second shot, then I think

14

the question is more pointed than, or more difficult than

15

you're admitting.

16

QUESTION:

May I ask you before you close to --

17

first, if I understand, your theory is this is a second --

18

a successive application.

19

MR. FERG:

That's correct.

20

QUESTION:

What is your theory on why we have

21

jurisdiction, given the plain language of the statute that

22

says the grant or denial of a successive application shall

23

not be appealable and shall not the subject of a petition

is a second, successive, right -- second or successive

application.

MR. FERG:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

And it was granted -- the court of

8

appeals said it shall be granted by the district court,

they shall entertain it.

MR. FERG:

But it said that we're allowing you

to do this because we're not going to find it was --

12

QUESTION:

Well, they say -- but you say they

13

were wrong on that.

14

MR. FERG:

Exactly.

15

QUESTION:

I mean, you can't say they're both

16

right and wrong.

17

having accepted -- if we agree with you on that

18

proposition, how do we have jurisdiction to hear the case?

19

If your theory is they were wrong, and

MR. FERG:

Two answers.

First of all, there are

20

the cases which I cited, including McNary v. the Asian

21

Refugees Center and Robison v. Johnson, which indicate

22

that when you're talking about not a specific

23

determination under a statutory scheme, but the validity

24

and construction of a scheme as a whole, that it's not

25

subject to those kinds of limitations on review, that

we're not looking at this point about the propriety of

them saying, this is an okay successive petition because

they said, this is not even a successive petition.

QUESTION:

you at your word, not them --

6

MR. FERG:

Right.

QUESTION:

-- because you're saying they're

MR. FERG:

And the second point is that,

8

9

Well, I know that's -- but I'm taking

wrong.

10

because -- first of all, those cases would indicate that

11

statutory cert is appropriate to review the overall

12

construction of the statute, but secondly, as I pointed

13

out, and why we brought a combined petition in the first

14

place, is that the issues in this case are of such

15

importance that they warrant review under the

16

extraordinary writ if somehow they don't fall under the

17

statutory writ.

18

QUESTION:

Well, I guess we permit such

19

inconsistent pleading, if you want to call it that, all

20

the time when we reverse a court of appeals which has

21

decided a case that the petitioner claims -- for which the

22

petitioner claims there was no jurisdiction.

23

For instance, if the petitioner says there's no

24

standing, he comes here and says, this Court doesn't have

25

any jurisdiction, and neither did the lower court.

Yes, but we never do that by adopting

both of the inconsistencies.

QUESTION:

May I ask again about the distinction

7

between the one who brings just the Ford claim, which you

say that's okay.

He hasn't had a first petition,

effectively.
Would a person who combines them might have this

in mind, or the lawyer:

to make sure that ultimately the Federal court hears that.

my client is incompetent.

others, I may be caught in a procedural default when I

claim to survive, you have to forfeit all those other

wouldn't any sensible lawyer say, he's got some good

I don't want to sacrifice them.

9
10

appropriate means of dealing with that is through the kind

11

of Ford evidentiary hearing that we had in the superior

12

court in Arizona, plus Arizona supreme court review, plus

13

cert to this Court, much like the pattern that has

14

followed for Federal prisoners.

15

Federal prisoners only have one bite at post

conviction relief through their own system.

All that

Congress has done here is said, okay, in these kinds of

claims you have exactly that same situation.

Just a

mixed -- a petition making four claims, two of which were

exhausted, two were not exhausted, and the district court

dismisses on the ground there wasn't complete exhaustion,

then if he comes back later, is that a first or a second

be a successive application.

QUESTION:

In your -- okay.

10

QUESTION:

I take it your position would entail

11

this strategy on the part of careful lawyers.

12

assume they have five serious habeas claims going to the

13

validity of the conviction and they also anticipate that

14

there's going to be at the end of the road a competency

15

claim.

16

Let's

In order not to be thrown out on the competency

17

claim they will save their five until the eve of execution

18

when their competency claim will be ripe, and yet that

19

will be at the furthest possible remove from the time of

20

trial so that if they also happen to be right on the

21

issues going to conviction it will be more difficult then

22

to go back and retry the case.

policy for Congress to want to promote, wouldn't it?

Indeed it would, and --

particularly if it's successful, is in fact going to take.
QUESTION:

3
4

He'd be barred by the statute of

limitations, wouldn't he?
MR. FERG:

5

He might well be barred that way and

6

also, as the Ninth Circuit pointed out, that when you come

7

in you get the automatic stay the first time around for

8

those other nonmental issues, then you've automatically

9

rendered the issue nonripe again, and so what we're

10

actually doing is saying, we want to get the mental

11

competency issue done in an expeditious manner.
QUESTION:

12

No, but that's the point, it can't be

13

done at all unless it is done in relation to competency at

14

time of execution.

15

MR. FERG:

Right.

16

QUESTION:

And if somebody comes in before an

17

execution date is imminent, then that's why it's not ripe,

18

and you don't -- I mean, you don't want to promote nonripe

19

claims.

20
21

22

I mean, it's simply irrelevant to litigate early
when the execution is going to be later.
MR. FERG:

That's correct.

It is an issue which

reasonably cannot -- or legally cannot be raised at that

point at all, and you're left to the very specific avenue

1

Right, but that then undercuts the

point that Congress wanted these things litigated early.

Congress doesn't want these things litigated at a time

when they're irrelevant.

they would be left to the State procedure, but what if the

State decided they won't have a procedure, which I suppose

they could do under your view?
MR. FERG:

10
11

Well, that very denial would itself

be grounds, I would suggest, to come before this Court.
For example, there's an old case called File v.

12

13

Duffy, where it was claimed that the custodian was not

14

looking into the competency of the individual, and so it

15

was brought through the California supreme courts and to

16

this Court by way of mandamus on the basis that denial of

17

any kind of review was itself a constitutional --

Yes, it would be, but that claim

wouldn't be ripe at any time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENISE I. YOUNG

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. YOUNG:

5

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I think it's very important, what we've just

7
8

heard here today from the State of Arizona.

9

that second or successive in 2244(b) cannot be read to

10

mean any numerically second petition is out.

11

what Mr. Ferg told us.

They agree

That's just

So what that means is now we've got to construe

12

13

the statute, and that's what we have been asking this

14

Court to do, and that's exactly what the court of appeals

15

did below.
The next thing that Mr. Ferg told us today is

16
17

that we can agree that a claim that can't be presented is

18

not presentable, does not fall within 2244(b), that that

19

type of claim will not be considered a second or

20

successive when that petitioner comes back to this Court,

21

comes back to the district court in a numerically second

22

petition.

23

That's exactly what we have here.

This is a

24

claim that the State of Arizona said in the lower court at

25

the time of the first petition was not presentable.

They

1

told the district court that there was no case or

2

controversy, no jurisdictionally sufficient case to have

3

that litigated.

4
5
6

QUESTION:

Because it was premature it would

have to be decided closer to the time of execution?
MS. YOUNG:

That's exactly right, Your Honor,

7

and that's what the court decided and it dismissed it

8

without prejudice and everybody knew that, at the time of

9

that dismissal, if Mr. Martinez-Villareal were to lose,

10

ultimately -- remember, at that time he had won on an

11

ineffective claim at sentencing, which the court of

12

appeals later reversed on a procedural default, but

13

everybody knew at that time that Mr. Martinez-Villareal

14

would be back if, in fact, he didn't prevail in the court

15

of appeals to litigate this very claim that everybody

16

agreed he could litigate at the proper time.

17

Now, what the court of appeals did in construing

18

this language agreed that this type of claim does not fall

19

within second or successive.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

Was AEDPA in effect at the time of

the first raising of this claim in the district court?
MS. YOUNG:

No, it was not, Your Honor but, as

23

Justice O'Connor mentioned, all the courts had held at

24

that time, before AEDPA, that Ford claims were not subject

25

to abuse, and that they were routinely raised for the

But you don't make any claim that

AEDPA shouldn't apply to this case, I take it?
MS. YOUNG:

It has -- what -- our position is

that this case doesn't fall within 2244(b).
QUESTION:

But you have not argued here or below

that the statute that Congress passed in the form of AEDPA
does not apply to your case?

11

MS. YOUNG:

12

QUESTION:

You say --

13

MS. YOUNG:

We do --

14

QUESTION:

15
16

It --

Yes.

-- that it is not a successive

petition under AEDPA.
MS. YOUNG:

That's right.

That's exactly right,

17

and so we do not fall within the 2244(b) because what

18

2244(b) is looking at are claims that had been presented.

19

Our claim was one that was never presentable.

20

QUESTION:

And you're --

21

QUESTION:

It seems to me your argument rests

22

upon the premise that it's unreasonable and therefore

23

presumably not the intent of 2244 that a claim which could

24

only be raised later should be barred, even if it comes up

25

in what could in some senses be called a second

I find it difficult to square that premise with

3

the text of 2244(b), which in (b)(2)(B) obviously

4

envisions situations in which, even though you couldn't

5

have raised the claim before, the claim is barred.

makes only one exception to that, and that is if the claim

7

couldn't be raised before and also is a claim that would

establish the innocence of the underlying offense.

It

I don't know any other way to read that

10

provision than as clearly affirming Congress doesn't care

11

about certain claims that can only be raised now but

12

nonetheless Congress says, even so, unless they go to the

13

innocence, go away.

There's two answers to that.

15

Haven't you also argued in effect that we

distinguish between abusive petitions and successive

18

thought you were saying that under the old rule there was

19

at least facially an argument that a Ford claim would be

20

successive, but it wasn't treated as successive by the

21

lower courts and, in fact, your opposing counsel agree on

22

that point, at least.

23

So I thought your argument was, they're using

24

the same term -- when they say second or successive

they're using the same term that was used before and

I believe that's read into it by

Presentable doesn't work, because you

could easily have new evidence discovered related to the

clearly that falls within (b)(2).

QUESTION:

That would --- thing you can do only under

certain circumstances, yet it wasn't presentable earlier

13

because you never had the new evidence earlier, or the

14

Brady material early, so it must have to do with the

nature of the word claim.

16

It must mean to include certain kinds of claims

A Ford claim is not the kind that in

MS. YOUNG:

Yes, that's right.
So then you say it's not a claim, or

Yes.
They might not have been as

aggravated, but they were apparent ones.
Aren't we going to have a number of cases in

litigated when the first claims were -- when the other

7

MS. YOUNG:

I think that that's going to have to

be something that the district court, which is something

10

typical that district courts do, will need to decide, but

11

that's right, there are those type of cases where the

12

evidence would be so apparent that counsel is under an

obligation to raise that, and the mental illness is such

that's not going to change.

MS. YOUNG:

And that's right.

I'm sorry, Your

7

Honor, I don't mean to be confusing, but what I'm saying

8

is, I think there are some circumstances where, if the

9

attorney raises the claim in the first petition, the

10

district court can then take a look at it and say, I've

11

looked at what you've brought me and this petitioner is

12

clearly incompetent, he's clearly very mentally ill, and

13

he's never going to get any better, I don't see any reason

14

to delay this.

15

The other situation where it could come up where

16

it would no longer be premature would be the situation

17

a petitioner came in with various claims besides his

18

incompetency to be executed under a warrant of execution

19

and the district court said, I don't find any of your

You're -MS. YOUNG:

I would think that would probably be

a better claim to be raised in a 1983 than in a 2254, the

4

clemency attack.

5

QUESTION:

You don't think -- you think it could

be raised in 1983 rather than habeas?

7

MS. YOUNG:

Yes, I would think so, because

8

that's what their -- they would be attack -- I guess you

9

could go under either a 2241 or a 1983.

MS. YOUNG:

15

Well, that -- now, that's supposed to

Oh.
That you couldn't -- you could not do

MS. YOUNG:

I have -- I am not sure.

It just --

16

it strikes me, the way that you were describing it, that

17

that would probably be a claim that would be brought under

18

1983 rather than under 22 -- rather than under habeas.

19

Now, as we've been talking about there's two

20

different reasons for the correctness of the court of

21

appeals decision below, and one is that this is not a

22

second or successive petition because there was no first

23

one challenging the same judgment, and the constitutional

24

violation, as the State of Arizona said in the first

25

proceeding, had not occurred and didn't occur until the

1

execution warrant issued, and that is the separate

2

j udgment.

3

The other grounds on which the court of appeals

4

was correct as well, however, was that this was a claim

5

that was dismissed without prejudice, and at that point

6

everybody knew that Mr. Martinez-Villareal was going to

7

come back and, as we've talked about, those claims are --

8

this claim was -- is analogous to the exhaustion claims

9

where there is some impediment to a determination and here

10

is absolutely nothing in any of the congressional history

11

that supports Congress' intent to not allow a petitioner

12

to bring at the first opportunity to have this claim

13

litigated.

14

There's nothing that says that Congress intended

15

to stop that.

In fact, what Congress was getting at, as

16

we talked about, was relitigation, but they were wanting

17

to ensure that every petitioner had one bite at the apple.

18

Those are the key phrases when you go through all of the

may be in front of you at some point, that you're going to

there would have been a new judgment, the execution

judgment, it seems like something out of the 1800's,

really.
MS. YOUNG:

17

It is something sort of out of the

18

1800's.

It's kind of an executive detention sort of

1

thing, and that's right, but that is what we're

20

challenging, because that's when the constitutional

21

violation arises, when the State seeks to execute somebody

22

who is incompetent.

In Justice Stevens' case, would it be

MS. YOUNG:

Now, some States have laws that say that if

Yes, he could.

someone -- for example, as Arizona, if someone is found

incompetent to be executed they're taken to a mental

hospital and in 30 days their competency is reassessed, so

if they had their competency reassessed and they say, now

he's competent, we're going forward, those -- that is a

situation where, under Justice Stevens' hypothetical, that

QUESTION:

Well, but wouldn't you take the

position that in that circumstance the State has the

burden to come in, to come forward and vacate the judgment

that the court had already -- and ask for a vacation of

17

the judgment that the court had already rendered and until

18

it did that, you wouldn't bring new habeas.

QUESTION:

No.
You'd just say, enforce what we've

got.
MS. YOUNG:

That's right, yes.

If there's still

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE M. FERG

16

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

17

MR. FERG:

Thank you, Ms. Young.

Very briefly, Your Honor, as

18

Ms. Young's argument conceded and as -- similar to what

1

her brief was, this case hinges to some degree on whether

20

or not successive in the current statute has the same

21

meaning, the same term of art that it was before, and I

22

want to show you that it does not.

23

In Kuhlman v. Wilson, going back all the way to

24

Sanders, this Court said that a successive petition raises

25

grounds identical to those raised and rejected on the

Here, we look at 2244(b)(2)

that says that a

claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus

that Congress was using second or successive in a form and
