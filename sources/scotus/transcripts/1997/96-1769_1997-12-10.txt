CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Parole Authority v. Woodard.
Mr. Klatt.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM A. KLATT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. KLATT:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:

11

This case presents a challenge to Ohio's death

12

penalty clemency procedures under the Due Process Clause

13

of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Self-Incrimination

14

Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.

15

I'd like to address the due process challenge first.

16

If I may,

Fundamentally, respondent's due process

17

challenge fails for two reasons.

18

constitutional or inherent right to clemency based upon

19

this Court's decision in Connecticut Board of Pardons v.

20

Dumschat.

21

and the procedures associated with it do not create a

22

constitutional entitlement because the Governor's exercise

23

of that power remains wholly discretionary.

24
25

Second, Ohio's adoption of the clemency power

QUESTION:
Klatt.

First, he has no

Well, let me ask you something, Mr.

Suppose that the Governor -- obviously an unlikely

scenario, but suppose the Governor of Ohio, some future

2

Governor, decided that he would grant clemency to -- he

3

would at least allow clemency hearings and consider

4

clemency for white defendants but not black.

5

there on a policy like that, would you say, under the

6

Constitution?

7
8

9

MR. KLATT:

No limit

I believe there would be a limit

under that - QUESTION:

So what we have to decide --

10

MR. KLATT:

There would be an equal --

11

QUESTION:

12

-- is, what are the limits, and how

do we draw that line.

3

MR. KLATT:

4

QUESTION:

Yes.
So you do concede that there would be

5

some equal protection concerns, certainly,

6

constitutionally imposed?

7

MR. KLATT:

Yes, Your Honor, we do concede that,

8

not rational basis equal protection, but certainly a

9

suspect category, perhaps even a substantive due process

20
21

problem in an outrageous circumstance.
QUESTION:

The court of appeals here, as I

22

understand it, based its ruling on the Due Process Clause,

23

not the Equal Protection Clause, is that correct?

24

MR. KLATT:

25

QUESTION:

That is correct.

That is correct.

I don't see -- what difference would

MR. KLATT:

2

Your Honor,

I don't believe it would

3

make a difference in terms of equal protection, rational

4

basis and due process.

5

essentially the same, although for slightly different

6

reasons.

7

I think the analysis would be

Fundamentally, the Due Process Clause is not

8

violated in this instance because there is no underlying

9

life, liberty, or property interest that's at stake.

That

10

interest has been adequately safeguarded by the

11

substantial protections that exist at the trial court

12

level and certainly throughout the appeal process leading

13

to the final conviction.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Klatt, are you then saying that

15

what -- there may be some process due, but whatever

16

process due it has been allowed, or are you taking the

17

position that due process, as distinguished from equal

18

protection, your answer to Justice O'Connor, due process

19

doesn't enter into it?

The examples that, was it Judge Nelson gave,

21

were due process examples.

1

read all this stuff, so we're going to toss a coin and

2

every tenth or, say, every tenth applicant will get

3

clemency?

4

MR. KLATT:

Your Honor, our position is that

5

fundamentally, because there is no underlying life,

6

liberty, or property interest, that a Governor could make

7

a clemency decision in an arbitrary manner.

8

inherent in the concept of unfettered discretion.

9

I don't think that would happen.

It's almost

There's no

10

reason to believe that a Governor would act any less

11

responsibly than a court would in exercising power, and in

12

fact clemency by constitutional design was meant to be an

13

unfettered power of the executive branch as a check on the

14

judicial branch, so fundamentally our position -QUESTION:

15

So it could be totally arbitrary as

16

long as it's not a denial, so you're saying there is an

17

equal protection check but not a due process check, is

18

that -MR. KLATT:

19
20
21

Yes.

Yes.

That's exactly our

position.
QUESTION:

Then it does matter on your analysis

22

that, although the State -- although there is no -- in

23

your judgment, although there is no life interest to be

24

protected, and although the Sate is not obligated to give

25

any clemency consideration at all, it still does not

1

matter on your analysis that the State has chosen to do

2

it, that that does not implicate a due process concern.

3

MR. KLATT:

It does not implicate it on these

4

facts for the simple reason that Ohio, in enacting the

5

power, did not in any way create standards or criteria

6

that limit the discretion of the decisionmaker.

7
8

QUESTION:

Well, that's certainly what Dumschat

held, wasn't it?

9

MR. KLATT:

That's exactly what Dumschat held,

10

Your Honor, and it's a case that we rely very heavily on.

11

We believe it's a case that is right on point in terms of

12

the facts that are confronted with -- that are confronted

13

the Court in our case.

14

QUESTION:

And the answer that the respondents

15

give is that they say because this is a death penalty it

16

is necessarily a part of the criminal process, and

17

Dumschat was not.

18

argument?

19

Is that how you understand their

MR. KLATT:

They, of course, make a number of

20

arguments, Your Honor, but that is one of them, and I

21

believe the argument is flawed for the simple reason that

22

the Court in Dumschat, relying I think principally on the

23

Greenholtz analysis, basically said that if the interest

24

that was at issue -- and in that case I admit it was a

25

liberty interest, not a life interest, but I don't think

1

that matters, because what the Court was saying is, if the

2

interest that was at issue was contemplated and

3

encompassed in the underlying conviction and sentence,

4

that that interest has been adequately safeguarded, and --

5

QUESTION:

Now, suppose -- and I suppose it's

6

not too unimaginable a hypothetical -- that the clemency

7

authorities said that you may not consult counsel in

8

preparation for your clemency hearing.

9

MR. KLATT:

Well, I think that would -- it

10

sounds as if you're asking a straight right to counsel

11

question.
QUESTION:

12

13

Yes.

That would probably be under

just the Sixth Amendment, wouldn't it?

14

MR. KLATT:

It would be I think just under the

15

Sixth Amendment, which of course is not at issue in this

16

case.

17

right to counsel constitutionally to -- in the clemency

18

process, so the State would not have to provide a counsel.

19
20
21

In answer to your question, I believe there is no

Now, of course, Ohio does provide counsel in
that process.
QUESTION:

Well, but in my hypothetical he has a

22

counsel but he's forbidden to consult the counsel in

23

preparing his written submission to the clemency board.

24
25

MR. KLATT:

I don't believe that would violate

due process, because there is no underlying -8

QUESTION:

2

of the Constitution?

3

MR. KLATT:

4

Sixth Amendment.

5

Well, would it violate any provision

It potentially could violate the

It potentially could.

QUESTION:

Well, of course, now the Sixth

6

Amendment is applicable to the States via the Fourteenth,

7

and then you're right back into the question of having to

8

have a life, liberty or property interest.

9

it would be life here.
MR. KLATT:

10

I would assume

It certainly is a life interest

11

here.

In that hypothetical, denying counsel at all in the

12

process certainly does not seem correct, but if there's no

3

underlying life, liberty, or property interest I don't

4

know how it would implicate a due process interest.

5

QUESTION:

Does it follow from your argument

6

that there is no due process implication to the provision

7

of direct appeals in criminal cases, no due process

8

implication in providing the cert process that we do?

MR. KLATT:

I don't believe that does follow,

Your Honor.

the processes that involve the judicial processes.

Clemency and that power is very distinct from

QUESTION:

Oh, I will grant -- I'll grant you

23

that, but what I was picking up on was the statement you

24

made ago in one of your answers, I guess, to Justice

25

Kennedy, that the interest being protected had been

1

protected in the underlying proceeding.

2

And I thought your point was that when in the

3

underlying criminal proceeding, for example, leading to

4

conviction, these interests had been protected, and there

5

was simply a constitutionally unnecessary further

6

proceeding, whether it be appeal, or cert, or clemency in

7

this case, that there was no application of due process to

8

those super-added stages.

9

Maybe I misunderstood your argument.
MR. KLATT:

10

If I implied that, I misspoke.

It's

11

our position that Evitts, which, of course, is a case that

12

is heavily relied upon by my opponent and relied upon by

13

the Sixth Circuit below, is also correctly decided in the

14

sense that due process certainly applies throughout the

15

adjudicatory process, which would include the appeal

16

process.

17
18
19

How much -QUESTION:

Right, but on your theory why

shouldn't the due process stop at the conviction?
MR. KLATT:

Because the other processes are part

20

of the system for adjudicating the guilt or innocence of

21

the defendant.

22

23

Clemency is not --

QUESTION:

So the adjudication's not final, in

other words.

understand it, a State could totally abolish appeal and

say after the trial court proceedings are over whether or

not the man will be sentenced or executed should be left

And if there's anything that seems

harsh about that, I suppose it is the deprivation of the

20

MR. KLATT:

I would agree, Your Honor.

I might

21

add that the fundamental flaw, I believe, in the

22

application of Evitts to this case, is that the lower

23

court's decision was based upon a faulty premise, and that

24

premise is, that faulty premise is that clemency is part

in our own writing.
Well,

I would contend, Your Honor,

7

that simply acknowledging the existence of a power of

8

another branch of Government does not,

9

make it part of the process, and in fact,

in and of itself,
as I mentioned

10

earlier, as a matter of constitutional structure,

11

is one of the checks and balances that we believe exists,

12

certainly under Ohio's constitution,

branch's check on the judicial system.

And of course,

that is an executive

the check on the clemency power

itself is basically the electoral process.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Klatt,

in Dumschat this

Court's opinion said that unlike probation pardon and

18

commutation decisions have not traditionally been the

19

business of the courts and,

subjects for judicial review.

If we were to take the position that it is

conceivable that wholly arbitrary action in the clemency

Would they survive that rare situation,

or how would you

2

left open the possibility that there could conceivably be

3

a due process violation?

4

MR. KLATT:

Well, I certainly would hope that

5

you wouldn't, but I believe that Ohio's death penalty

clemency procedure in this case would survive such

scrutiny.

11

QUESTION:

Are you going to address the

allegations with any particularity or specificity in
giving me that answer?
MR. KLATT:

I'd be certainly happy to.

Keep in

12

mind here that this policy was enacted to address a

13

problem, and the problem was that the Governor was

14

confronted with clemency applications with very little

15

information, oftentimes because counsel for the death row

16

inmates would not seek stays until the very last minute.

17

In fact, they had a situation where counsel for

18

a death row inmate filed for the stay the day before the

19

execution date with the district court judge.

20

denied the stay.

21

That judge

The stay was subsequently granted later that day

22

in the Sixth Circuit, but the Governor was quite upset

23

that with practically no information he was confronted

24

with a clemency situation, so they enact these procedures.

25

The procedures are designed to be -13

11

No.

collateral attack on the conviction?
MR. KLATT:

It was a stay obtained in the Sixth

Circuit, a stay of execution so that he could pursue

14

Federal habeas.

15

I'm sorry if I misspoke.

QUESTION:

The problem that I'm having is, this

16

case is in an interlocutory posture, and so looking at the

17

opinion, I thought perhaps the circuit has just held that

18

the Due Process Clause could, in some conceivable

19

circumstance, be violated, and can we say now that we

20

could never even imagine a circumstance, so matter how

21

bizarre or peculiar or unfair the system was, that it

22

couldn't possibly be a violation no matter what, and the

23

same, really, in a sense is true of the Fifth Amendment

part.

have to confess to every crime ever, ever conceivable by

3

any member of -- you know, think of the most bizarre

circumstance you can.

5

And now, if there is such a circumstance in

6

which either of these clauses would apply, how can we say

7

that you win, in this posture of the case?

8

9

MR. KLATT:

Well, it's our position, Your Honor,

and we are taking an absolute position, that with respect

10

to due process there is no due process protections that

11

apply here for the simple reason, as I stated earlier,

12

that there is no underlying life, liberty, or property

13

interest to --

QUESTION:

I suppose we could put the same kind

15

of questions if you were arguing about the executive power

Mr. Klatt, I thought that that was

22

one of the arguments that you made, but in your first

argument was kind of like a, what's labeled political

3

This is committed to another branch of

But your immediate response was no, there is

4

judicial review for constitutionality under the heading of

equal protection, so I gathered from that answer that you

6

weren't taking the answer that you are now giving, that

7

this is just hands-off for the judiciary, it is entirely

8

executive branch business.

9

MR. KLATT:

I may have misspoke.

My point was

10

that with respect to a due process analysis our position

11

is absolute, because you could --

QUESTION:

But if you're using the political

question doctrine, that model, it isn't that as to one

We're not going quite that far,

QUESTION:

What is outrageous?

I mean, once you

say equal protection, it seems to me you give -- suppose

the Governor has two applicants for pardon, they are

identical in all their circumstances, and the Governor

says, I grant one and I don't grant the other.

You've gotten the

the Equal Protection Clause --

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. KLATT:

It's the position of the State of

16

Ohio that since the clemency power comes from the

17

constitution, at least the Ohio constitution, in Ohio,

18

that it can't violate another expressed provision of the

19

Constitution, and the only one I can think of would be a

20

race-based decision.

21

QUESTION:

That seems inherently wrong -Why, because that is currently a very

22

enraging thing, but why is that any more enraging than two

23

identically qualified people, and the Governor says, I

Why is that

MR. KLATT:

Well, even in Dumschat the Court

seemed to indicate that you could deny clemency for any

reason or no reason at all for any constitutionally

permissible reason.

If it's not a constitutionally

Now, keep in mind, equal protection is not an

issue that's currently before you, but if I understand,

it's -- it's a diff -- hypothetical.

QUESTION:

So, supposing the Governor has

10

complete control over the use of the Ohio State stadium

11

for the Ohio State-Michigan game, and he decides that only

12

white people will be admitted for that game.

13

Now, nobody has any sort of a protected liberty

14

interest or property interest to go to that game at all,

15

but nonetheless the Equal Protection Clause would apply to

16

prevent that sort of discrimination, would it not?

17

MR. KLATT:

I believe it would, and that's I

18

think our essential point, and I don't think quite frankly

19

from a practical standpoint it's that much of a

20

concession.

21

due process analysis which would -- at any level, which

22

seems to totally open up the door.

is race the only basis for denial of equal protection?

apply contingent upon the kind of protected interest

analysis which is identical to the Due Process Clause?

4

MR. KLATT:

5

QUESTION:

That's exactly it, Your Honor.
And your argument as I understood it

6

was that once there has been a final adjudication through

7

the appellate process which has resulted in a judgment

8

that this individual should lose his life, that there is

9

no life interest left for the Due Proces Clause to

10

protect.

Isn't that your argument, and that's why you

11

take the absolutist position on due process?
MR. KLATT:

12

3

QUESTION:

Yes.
So that if we disagree with you on

that, if we say, for example, well, clemency really is

part of the adjudicatory process, or if we were to say,

well, if you grant a clemency proceeding you've got to

have some minimal process for it, you would lose, but at

MR. KLATT:

I believe we would win even if there

were some level of due process protection.

MR. KLATT:

And the reason is, is because here

we had notice, and opportunity for an interview.

could participate in terms of helping with the preparation

of written materials that the applicant could submit if

19

they wanted to, so you certainly had notice, opportunity

for participation, an informal review process -- the whole

21

procedure was designed to be fair both to the inmate as

well as to the public, as well as to the courts, and as

23

well as to the prosecutor, so I believe the procedure is a

fair one under any analysis.

1

it is not an adversarial process, which is the very reason

2

why counsel were not permitted at the interview, and

3

counsel would not be permitted at the review itself, and

4

we don't believe that that is in any way problematic,

5

because there's no due process requirement under our

6

argument that that applies, and it's --

7

QUESTION:

I take it part of his argument might

8

be, though I'm not positive on this, is that the timing of

9

this is really -- there's no reason in the world under

10

the -- as far as clemency is concerned that you have to

11

have the timing deadlines the way you do, and the way you

12

do means that he has to incriminate himself completely at

13

a time prior to the ultimate affirmation of his

14

convictions, and you could move that easily so he didn't

15

have to do that, but the way it stands, he might have to

16

have a new trial, and then he'd be convicted out of his

own mouth simply because of an unnecessary and arbitrary

and that this case be remanded to determine whether such

2

set of facts exists.

3

QUESTION:

Well, we deal, Ms. Shank, don't we,

with the facts that were alleged with respect to the Ohio

5

parole, Ohio clemency process.

6

could conjure up some hypothetical set of facts that

7

weren't the standard Ohio clemency process.

MS. SHANK:

I mean, it's not as if we

We are bound by what's in the

pleadings and by the process as it appears in the record,

10

Your Honor, and if I understand your question, I think

11

you're asking if the Court can make a decision on those

12

facts alone.

3

QUESTION:

Well, the -- I got the intimation,

4

perhaps mistakenly, from your statement that if we could

5

conceive of some clemency process somewhere that had some

6

sort of provisions in it that would be so arbitrary we

7

would say due process applies, we should bring that to

8

bear on this case, but we're dealing with an established

9

system of clemency in Ohio, are we not?
MS. SHANK:

20

And I agree, it has to be some

21

process that you can conceive within the procedure that is

22

present here, but I think there are many such conceivable

23

fact situations that may or may not be able to be proved

to whether the district court could find that the coercion

2

to confess guilt was an unconstitutional condition.

3

MS. SHANK:

4

QUESTION:

Your Honor, that -Wasn't that what the remand was

5

limited to, or was it remanded for the district court to

6

come up with any other due process violation?

7

MS. SHANK:

Well, it was remanded with respect

8

to both the Sixth Circuit's analysis of Evitts v. Lucey

9

and the idea that clemency is, in fact, as it is, an

10

integral part of Ohio's criminal justice system as well as

11

on the Fifth Amendment issue.

12

But, of course, because this was a case that was

13

ruled on based on a motion to dismiss and therefore the

14

pleadings, this Court comes to it as if it's de novo

15

review, and so the Court can look within the pleadings as

16

broadly as it chooses to, so any set of facts that the

17

Court can conceive would be -- that would allow due

process to apply --

MR. KLATT:

The Court found that there were no

QUESTION:

MR. KLATT:

Yes.
But the important point for us with

regard to Dumschat is the fact that the Court noted in the

final line of the opinion that Connecticut had a State

right to clemency and there had been no breach of that

right.

10

Now, the Court went no further, but the fact

11

that the Court recognized a difference between the end

At the end of this process,

Well, okay, Justice Scalia, we're

actually presenting four different grounds, one of them

9

being the fact that the State has created a liberty

10

interest and a life interest in clemency in Ohio, and that

11

is in the right to seek it, and the Ohio supreme court

12

noted in Weaver v. State that clemency is the remedy that

13

is available to individuals who are unable to achieve

14

redress in the courts.

They said in In re Kline that Ohio defendants

MS. SHANK:

No, they were not included in the

QUESTION:

May I go back to Dumschat for a

2

second, because I didn't think you distinguished it in the

3

same way that the court of appeals did.

4

one can reasonably say that the right to due process

5

before liberty is taken away is exhausted once you're in

6

jail, because your liberty's gone.

7

It seems to me

But you're relying on the right to due process

8

before life is taken away, and this man is still alive, so

9

you have an argument for a protected interest in

10

procedures until his life is taken away that just wasn't

11

available in Dumschat because he was in jail.

12

MS. SHANK:

That's correct.

We do also present

3

to the Court the fact that there is a Federal life

4

interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment that is

5

independent of the other issues that we've presented, the

6

other types of interests, and that that was not present in

7

Dumschat, and that it independently is basis alone to

8

allow this Court to make the decision that special -- that

9

this special proceeding for death penalty cases impacts

20

that life interest and therefore distinguishes it from

21

Dumschat.

22

QUESTION:

I think the State might argue it this

23

way in response to your argument about the life interest.

24

I think the State might say, we agree that there is a life

execution under Ohio law, but that's not what's in

2

question here.

3

What's in question here is an opportunity to

4

have life after the date which the law has already said at

5

which it may be taken away, and because you have no life

6

interest after that point -- you litigated that on direct

7

appeal and you lost -- because you have no life interest

8

after that point, and because that is the only life

9

interest that could be served by clemency, there is no

10

interest for Fourteenth -- for due process analysis, to

11

which process could apply and help you.

12

What's your answer to that argument?

13

MS. SHANK:

Well, first that the life interest

14

remains fully intact as long as a person is alive.

15

mean, the Fourteenth Amendment right to life that is

16

protected is nothing more and as simple as the right to be

17

alive and to continue to live, and a date does not

18

determine when that right that is protected ends.

19

only thing that ends that right and its protection under

20

the Constitution is actual death.

21

I

The

So the life interest, unlike liberty, isn't

22

diminished in increments.

It's not diminished by having

23

been placed into the prison, as is the liberty interest,

24

and it can't be diminished in bits and pieces.

And I think recently this Court recognized that

4

was a right to assisted suicide.

cited the Ohio supreme court, saying that even condemned

6

prisoners have the right to protection of law up until the

last moment of life.

8

QUESTION:

There the Court even

Well, all we held in the assisted

9

suicide case was that there was no constitutional right to

10

have the assistance of a physician if you wanted to commit

11

suicide, wasn't it?

12

MS. SHANK:

13

QUESTION:

That's correct.
Can you think of any other analogies?

14

I take it your basic argument is that the procedural part

15

of this is something that the Ohio legislature itself has

16

said is not within the Governor's exclusive power.

17

say the general assembly's authority to regulate the

18

application process extends from the time just before the

19

Governor reaches the decision, and you're talking about

20

that time before, is that right?

21

MS. SHANK:

22

QUESTION:

They

That's correct.
And what I'm looking for, the only

23

one with a very far analogy is like international airline

they would review what used to be the Civil Aeronautics

2

Board's preparation of the recommendation to the

3

President.

4

That's a pretty far-out analogy, and I wonder if

5

there are other instances you could think of where the

6

congressionally regulated preparation of the application

7

is certainly reviewable, but the final decision is not.

You've looked into this, so I assume your answer

QUESTION:

Have you -- the other

15

question that I has is, is the particular problem here,

16

which I couldn't quite figure out from the dates -- I

17

can't keep them quite in mind, but the particular problem

18

is that the State says, prepare this 45 days before the

19

execution is scheduled, but in the case of your client, he

20

had to go to his hearing 6 months before, or 4 months

21

before, because there was a stay that said the execution

22

couldn't take place until January 18,

23

to have the hearing on September 9, 1994, and you're

24

objecting to the fact that they made him come to that

25

hearing without a lawyer, and having to incriminate

himself so soon.

2

those work?

3

Could you explain that a little bit, how

MS. SHANK:

Sure.

There are a number of factors

4

involved in it.

5

managed to get a stay when -- within 45 days before the

6

first scheduled execution date after the Ohio supreme

7

court finishes direct appellate review, a hearing will be

8

scheduled, and even if you get a subsequent stay -- in

9

this case the stay was actually granted on the 45th day,

The time frame is that if you have not

10

so it's one of those counting things.

11

day did count for their purposes, and we would, of

12

course --

13

QUESTION:

They decided that

So your objection, then, precisely is

14

you say, look, he can't have a lawyer, he has to

15

incriminate himself, and all they have to do to avoid the

16

problem and keep their time is, you say, do it 45 days

17

before, but if there's been an extension of a stay, well,

18

then it's 45 days before the real execution date, not the

19

one that was just hypothetical.

20

MS. SHANK:

Is that the problem?

Well, the problem is more

21

complicated than that because, of course, the petition --

22

I mean, the respondent in this case, or the inmate in any

23

case has an extremely limited control on that timing.

24

You can file for a stay, but there are many

25

exigencies that come up in the court system that sometimes
40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.
SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

1

it takes 2 months to get a stay, sometimes you're very

2

lucky and you can get a stay within a week or 2 or 3 days,

3

so you don't have control over the timing in this case no

4

matter how it is handled.

5

But part of the reason that this is so critical

6

is that whenever this particular process kicks in it then

7

negates the opportunity -- well, I should say, negates the

8

right to have a clemency application filed by the inmate

9

and have it considered.

10

QUESTION:

Ms. Shank, is there any rule in Ohio

11

that you know of that would prevent your client in his

12

interview with the clemency people from declining to

13

answer a question because it might incriminate him?

14

MS. SHANK:

There's nothing in the procedure

15

that says that that could not be done, although the

16

procedure itself is, with regard to the interview is

17

inherently coercive, counsel is specifically prohibited

18

from being there, in this case we had 3 days' notice and

19

counsel would not have had an opportunity --

20

QUESTION:

But so far as you know there are no

21

further sanctions -- in fact, it's difficult to see what

22

further sanction could be attached to someone who is

23

condemned to death -- would be attached if the -- if your

24

client simply said, I'm not going to answer that question?

Well, they may draw an adverse

inference from his silence, may view him as being

2

uncooperative, and go --

3

QUESTION:

But that wouldn't incriminate him.

4

MS. SHANK:

Well, but it's part of what the

5

problem is with the choice that he is facing.

6

Incriminating him if he chose to speak and then those

7

matters were used against him --

8

9
10

QUESTION:

But that happens in civil proceedings

all the time.
MS. SHANK:

And it's possible, too, that it

11

could be used to impeach him, and the silence itself could

12

at least be attempted to be used for impeachment in

13

subsequent criminal proceedings, so --

14
15
16

QUESTION:

Well, by the time you get to clemency

beggars can't be choosers.
MS. SHANK:

Well, Your Honor, and I think that

17

if clemency were to be handled at the end of the process

18

instead of at this premature point where you have ongoing

19

litigation and future litigation as a right still in front

20

of you, that it might be possible that a procedure that

21

set some time limits toward the end of the process would

22

meet due process.

with a capital defendant who's lost, but what about other

2

defendants?

What's the end of the process?

As long as they're in prison they can continue

to find new reasons why the case should be reopened, and

to death?

Well, for Ohio's purposes it's not

relevant because they don't put these restrictions on

11

frames, this mandatory, this forced clemency review at

12

this early date is only applied in capital cases.

QUESTION:

Well, Justice Scalia, I think it's

part of the problem with that process, is that if a

that State right we've talked to you about seeking

25

clemency, then he's made some choices about where he wants

to go and the statements he's making.

2

But when he is subjected to a forced process at

3

a time when he is still in litigation, those

4

considerations aren't available to him.

5

QUESTION:

I understand, but my -- the point I'm

6

making is, we can't solve the problem, as Justice Breyer

7

suggests, by simply making sure that the proceeding here

is held after the last habeas before the execution.

9

problem's going to exist in noncapital cases perpetually.
MS. SHANK:

10

The

Justice Scalia, I must say that if

11

it was a forced process at some time I think that perhaps

12

the hypothetical you're proposing would have application

13

to noncapital cases, but that's not the situation in Ohio.

14

Noncapital cases aren't subjected to that standard.

15

aren't forced into clemency review and, of course, we are

16

dealing with the capital case here.

QUESTION:

Suppose Ohio said, well, for capital

advisor?

been impaired.

barrier to getting to the decisionmaker, I think that the

4

clemency right to seek has been observed.

5
6

As long as the State doesn't erect a

Part of the problem we have here is that we have
a process that keeps us --

7

QUESTION:

So once you have a process, once you

8

try to install something like this, it better be

9

meticulously observed.

Doesn't that give the signal that

10

it's not very wise for a State to have these processes,

11

that they ought to stick with just a simple, you ask the

12

Governor, the Governor says no, that's it?

13

MS. SHANK:

I don't think it has that meaning

14

here, because the meticulous observation of rules comes

15

from that line of cases, Meacham and the prison cases,

16

Greenholtz, some of the cases that have been mentioned.

17

But in those cases, the procedure did not erect

18

a barrier either to getting to the final decisionmaker

19

even in Dumschat, even in the prison cases, and it did not

20

prevent the ultimate decisionmaker from making his

21

decision.

22

This process has to be complied with -- I mean,

23

the application process has to be complied with for the

24

Governor to make a valid decision, and it's a forced

25

process that once it's been engaged in, its initial timing

denies a meaningful opportunity to be heard at a

2

meaningful time and then precludes the right to seek when

3

it is meaningful, because it becomes discretionary with

4

the APA whether a subsequent application from the inmate

5

will be considered for clemency.

That is under paragraph G of the policy, which

makes it forever, and then in the administrative code,

At the moment I

determine may or may not be the final time limit on how

3

So I think that the process distinction here,

4

and the reason we don't have to worry about the details,

5

is that this is a process that keeps us from getting

6

there.

7

parsing of the language are ones where you always were

8

able to get there.

Those cases that address that kind of detailed

I also think that in this case we have a

situation where the process itself has created the kinds

of parameters that this Court has recognized as creating a

that deserves due process protection.

QUESTION:

The interview places no condition

Suppose it was very clear that

22

silence would be not only an adverse inference but would

23

likely result in denial of clemency.

MR. KLATT:

those circumstances.

You might have compulsion under
That's not the situation here.

QUESTION:

What if the

-- I don't know if she

2

wants this argument, but the strongest point, I thought,

3

going back to the complaint, would be a Mathews v.

4

Eldridge point, that all she wants is you to postpone this

5

hearing until it's 45 days before the real execution, and

6

you won't do it.

7

And the State's interest in not doing it -- you

8

know, not postponing it till the 45 days is real, is zero,

9

her interest is -- well, she loses her right, the client

10

loses right to a lawyer and self-incrimination in a real

11

practical way, very strong.

12

tremendous.

13

follow what the court does, and therefore this is a

14

tremendously strong argument for -- since it isn't even

15

the Governor, it's the special board run by the

16

legislature, for denial of due process.

17

The administrative ease is

All you have to do is say we're going to

Now, I'm being quick about that, but I -- so

18

what's your -- what -- I got that out of the complaint --

19

what's --

20

MR. KLATT:

Well, I would respectfully disagree,

21

that there is a very important, legitimate State interest

22

in the timing of obtaining the information.

23

stay would be obtained, the order --

QUESTION:

Even if a

Sure there is, but everybody else,

everybody without a stay it's 45 days before, it's before

the real execution, so what's your interest in getting

2

that information 6 months before the execution, where all

3

that's happened is that there's been a court order

4

delaying it for 6 months.

5

MR. KLATT:

Well, if I understand your question,

6

I don't know that the State would have an interest at that

7

point -QUESTION:

8

9

Here they ask -- they pointed out,

they enclose, attached to the complaint, the court order

10

of Ohio making the execution date not 45 days after

11

September 9, but sometime after the following January 18,

12

and still the board, they say, wouldn't postpone the

13

hearing.

14

They wanted to have it on the 9th.
MR. KLATT:

That's correct.

The simple fact

15

that there is a time limit -- in this instance it was 45

16

days, which seems to be a reasonable period of time -- who

17

knows when the stay might ultimately be obtained.

18

might never be obtained.

19

QUESTION:

It

I suppose for Mathews v. Eldridge to

20

apply there has to be some protected interest under the

21

Due Process Clause in the first place.

MR. KLATT:

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

24
25

Absolutely, and fundamentally -Thank you, Mr. Klatt.

I think you've answered the question.
