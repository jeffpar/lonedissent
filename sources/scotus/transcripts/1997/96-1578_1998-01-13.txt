ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARRELL E. JORDAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. JORDAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The Texas IOLTA program is an extension of the

11
12

ethical rules that have always been applicable to lawyers

13

in connection with their maintenance of client funds.

14

Lawyers have always been required to manage client funds

15

as fiduciaries.

16

programs were adopted, they require it today under IOLTA,

17

and they would require it tomorrow if IOLTA programs went

18

away.

19
20
21

22

23

The rules required this before IOLTA

QUESTION:

But they're required to manage it as

fiduciaries for the benefit of the clients, are they not?
MR. JORDAN:

That's correct, Your Honor, Mr.

Chief Justice.
Clients received no interest income on their

24

nominal and short-term deposits before IOLTA.

25

IOLTA, they don't receive any interest income on their

nominal and short-term deposits, and if -QUESTION:

2

Well, Mr. Jordan, by way of

3

background, the IOLTA funds account also include deposits

4

from corporations, do they not?

5

MR. JORDAN:

6

QUESTION:

That's correct, Justice O'Connor.
And as to the corporate moneys that

7

are deposited as opposed to the share that's the result of

8

deposits by individuals, is there a correspondingly larger

9

amount of interest earned?

I mean, is there interest

10

being earned in the accounts for the corporate funds that

11

exceed the cost of maintenance of the funds?
MR. JORDAN:

12

Justice O'Connor, we are not able

13

to track what percentage of the IOLTA interest income that

14

gets to the foundation comes from corporate or partnership

15

deposits.

16
17

18

QUESTION:

Do you know what percentage of the

deposits are from corporate as opposed to individuals?
MR. JORDAN:

I only have my opinion, and that

19

would be, Justice O'Connor, that probably about 60 percent

20

or so do come from corporate or partnership - -

21

QUESTION:

I was curious because the amounts of

22

individuals that --of interest earned that wouldn't

23

exceed the cost of establishment and maintenance of the

24

fund nevertheless seem to be generating substantial

25

amounts of money for these programs, and so it seemed to

1

me very likely there were corporate deposits that were

2

generating substantially more interest, and that's why so

3

much was being earned.

4

MR. JORDAN:

One of the reasons, Your Honor,

5

that IOLTA is able to earn interest for the foundation

6

when it cannot for individual clients whose money is

7

deposited, whose short-term and nominal funds are

8

deposited in IOLTA accounts, is that it takes advantage of

9

the changes in the banking law that occurred in 1980 where

10

corporate and partnership accounts can be pooled with

11

individual funds in an IOLTA account, and then, based on

12

the tax ruling, there's no taxable transaction, the

13

efficiency of the economy of scale where one pooled

14

account and the recipient can be attributed to one

15

foundation, all of this generates --

16

QUESTION:

Are corporations making these

17

deposits, or anyone, for that matter, given an option

18

about whether to have their moneys go into an IOLTA

19

account or not, or is it required that they go into an

20

IOLTA account?
MR. JORDAN:

21
22

is mandatory for the lawyer.

QUESTION:

2

MR. JORDAN:

How about for the client?
But if there's any way a client's

deposit can earn net interest for that client, whether

4

it's a corporate client, whether it's an individual

5

client, the lawyer's ethical responsibility is to do that.

6

QUESTION:

Well --

7

QUESTION:

But I thought for the corporate

8

client they were prohibited from receiving the interest

9

from the NOW account.

10

MR. JORDAN:

Your Honor, they would not be able

11

to have those funds placed in a NOW account, a demand

12

account.

13

QUESTION:

Right.

Now, could the corporation

14

doing business say, okay, I'm going to get legal services,

15

but you put my deposit with an account that's not a NOW

16

account and I'll take the interest, thank you.

may be permissible.

QUESTION:

2

Mr. Jordan, one of your earlier

3

statements makes me think that very likely times have

4

changed since I practiced law long ago, but my - - I'm

5

familiar with a firm trust account, whereby a number of

6

clients' moneys would be placed in the same account.

7

don't ever recall a situation where you opened up a

8

separate account for each client whose money you had in

9

trust.

10

I

The firm put all of the money in the trust

account.
So it seems to me it's not entirely accurate to

11

12

say that these moneys could never have earned interest.

13

You treat it as if every single separate trust deposit

14

would be a separate account.

15

practiced.
MR. JORDAN:

16

That was never true when I

Mr. Chief Justice, before IOLTA, of

17

course, the deposits from clients were put into a

18

noninterest-bearing demand account, for the most part.

19

With the advent of IOLTA, if the amount of the client

20

deposit was small enough, or was going to be held for a

21

short enough period of time, they went into the IOLTA

22

account.

23

are going to be able to earn net interest for the client,

IOLTA doesn't apply to any amounts of money that

the client funds of many clients to be pooled.

4
5

IOLTA enables, Mr. Chief Justice,

QUESTION:

And why shouldn't that interest go to

the clients?
MR. JORDAN:

6

Because the client, Mr. Chief

7

Justice, had no reasonable expectation to receive interest

8

income, net interest income on small or short-term

9

deposits before IOLTA, during IOLTA, and if IOLTA were to

10

go away, that benefit would be retained by the banks.

11

would not change one thing for the client.
QUESTION:

12

It

You mean that if a firm pooled its

13

trust accounts and put them all in one account, called a

14

trust account, the bank would not have to pay interest on

15

it?

16

MR. JORDAN:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. JORDAN:

Mr. Chief Justice -Do you mean that?
A lawyer or a law firm is able now,

19

Mr. Chief Justice, to pool eligible client funds, and if

20

there can be any way that that account can yield a net

21

benefit to the client, that's what the lawyer is supposed

to do.

QUESTION:

So IOLTA accounts wouldn't cover a

QUESTION:

11

MR. JORDAN:

I thought you just said it didn't.
Mr. Chief Justice, I must have

12

misunderstood your question, then, because what I'm saying

13

is that when the lawyer receives the funds from the

14

client, he or she makes an independent determination about

15

whether they're able to be placed in an account that would

16

benefit the client, using any means that are legal,

MR. JORDAN:

1

No, Mr. Chief Justice.

If the

2

lawyer, in good faith, determines that there is no way

3

that that client fund can earn net interest, interest over

4

the cost of attributing it, then the money goes into an

IOLTA account.

That is required under our rules.

I'm not sure you've answered the

yes, but if I put it with 19 other clients' accounts it

will earn money.

Am I looking at it independently or not?

MR. JORDAN:

QUESTION:

MR. JORDAN:

Right.

to earn a net interest benefit for the client, then you

are able to do that.

QUESTION:

Why isn't that always going to be the

2

and, in fact, it will be invested in a way that will get

3

the penny to the client.

4

MR. JORDAN:

5

QUESTION:

That's correct.
But in these pooled funds, even

6

though the pooled funds earn interest, the cost of

7

accounting for that interest separately to the client

8

would be greater than the interest that would be

9

attributable to the client.

10
11

MR. JORDAN:

Is that correct?

That is correct, Justice Souter,

and one other thing that I think is important - -

MR. JORDAN:

QUESTION:

Except for the corporate deposits.
Now, let's not forget that, because

15

they can be very substantial, but there's some provision

16

in the law for NOW accounts that says you can't pay

17

anything to a corporation.

18

MR. JORDAN:

Justice O'Connor, one of the things

19

that makes IOLTA possible, of course, is the IRS ruling

20

that allows there to be no taxable transaction.

21

If, in Justice Souter's question, you were

22

attributing and tracking the interest to be paid to each

23

client, then the bank, whether it's a sub account or

24

whatever, would have to have a taxpayer ID number, the

25

bank would have to send a 1099, the law firm would

Why does it say -- it says,

11

That's what's causing the confusion, I think, because if

you think of three clients, A, B, and C, and they each

Yes, you do.

So that means, in the example that's

being given -- I'm sorry to give this, but its -- everyone

has, and I think it's not totally clear yet, that what we

8

have is a circumstance where there are three clients.
They each give you some money, if you have to open up

10

three accounts it's just not going to be worthwhile

11

because the administrative expenses are too great.
But the banker comes to you and says, give me

12

13

all three together.

There is no IOLTA fund in the State

14

I'm talking about.

He gives me all three together, and I

will generate interest for you that exceeds administrative

costs.

Now, in that circumstance, do you put that money

in that fund, which is private, or do you give it to

IOLTA?

MR. JORDAN:

If, Justice Breyer, there's any way

Mr. Chief Justice, generally

No, but there are several

important distinctions between this case and Webb's, if I

illustrate what's so different about this case.
First of all, in Webb's the premise of the

7
8

Court's opinion was that the interest earned was not tied

9

to reimbursing the State for its costs.

In other words,

10

the premise was that there was net interest earned.

11

was a separate exaction by the State calculated on a

12

percentage of the amount deposited to reimburse the State

13

for its costs, so that was a case where there was net

interest.

do you think, if each person giving a lawyer money that

revenue ruling 81-209 that we cite in our brief was that

2

the client did not have control, because if the client has

control as to -- over whether the lawyer will deposit the

4

money in the IOLTA account, then the income generated by

5

that account, which goes to a charitable contribution,

might be an assignment of income by the individual

money in a bank, what the depositor gets in return is,

14

MR. SAMP:

The small amount is $1,000 that has

been in this account since 1993.

16

his lawyer is that his lawyer holds the legal title to

these trust funds.

QUESTION:

Well, if that's so, why -- this is

exactly the problem I'm having.

MR. SAMP:

Justice --

6

QUESTION:

So on any of those analogies, the

7

answer is there is no property interest in what's used,

8

what's gained, but the question is whether we can use the

9

basic fund for that purpose.

10

Now, I put that quite squarely because I want to

11

hear your response to the point, why is there a property

12

interest in that electricity that my water is used to

13

make, or the interest here?

14

MR. SAMP:

Justice Breyer, the Court in its

15

Webb's Fabulous Pharmacy case saw these two issues that

16

you're presenting as really the flip side of each other,

17

that really the reason that interest follows principal is

18

because in effect the use of the principal is what

19

generates the interest, and therefore the Government's

20

temporary taking or use of the original principal is the

21

same thing as the taking of the interest.

22

Now, in some of the examples you have given,

23

there are many things that distinguish them.

in the case of the Government taking a tax, it has always

25

been thought that a properly constituted tax that does not

No, but the -- when IOLTA talks about

It's

8

talking about offsets necessary, not only to account for

the funds, but to account for them separately to each

source, to file the appropriate tax information for each

11

source, to pay the interest out to each source, and so on,

12

and those, in fact, are separate costs which are not

13

incurred in a pooled fund.

14

So sure, you're right, no matter how you hold it

15

there's going to be some accounting cost, but the premise

16

of IOLTA is, there are going to be more accounting and

Precisely, and in fact that is the

unanimous view of the court of appeals right now, is that

prison accounts, when they are set up and they actually

earn interest, the prison is entitled to take a reasonable

remains is the property of the clients, and they --

seems to me equally legitimate to ask the question, should

2

we recognize a property right in the interest for Fifth

3

Amendment purposes if, in fact, the result on the premise

4

of the case would be that there was no just compensation

5

due at the end of the road because the client, in - -

6

because -- yes, the client in fact had lost nothing that

7

the client would otherwise have had?

8

9

In other words, wouldn't it be legitimate for us
to consider what will happen at stage --or what ought to

10

happen at stage 2 in deciding whether in the first

11

instance to recognize a property right at stage 1?

12

MR. SAMP:

I think it would be a preferable

13

course for the Court to have a full record as to whether

14

or not there was a loss to the client prior to making that

15

determination.

16

The initial decision the court of -- the

17

district court will have to face is whether or not the per

18

se taking rules apply and then, if they do not, then the

19

question is, each of the various factors that the Court

20

has enunciated for whether a taking exists, and those

21

sorts of questions perhaps could best be decided on a

22

fuller record.

25

QUESTION:

The court of appeals made no effort

to decide the second question, did it?
MR. SAMP:

That is correct, yes.

That's correct, and they also, while

5

they reinstated our First Amendment claim, they really

had -- had virtually no discussion of the First Amendment

the Fifth Amendment issue, we would hope that that issue

10

QUESTION:

There's a lot of law that concerns

11

contracts and trusts, and misuse of trusts, and I take it

12

it's common law in most States that if a trustee misuses

13

your money and makes money out of it he's going to have to

14

pay that to you, and that seems to help you.

15

MR. SAMP:

That is correct.

16

QUESTION:

All right.

But what's worrying me

17

here is that we're talking about, not your loss, but the

18

misperforming trustee's gain, let's say, assuming

1

everything in your favor, the misperforming trustee's gain

20

over and above your loss, and I'm -- have you found

21

anything -- I'm nervous about, or would worry about the

22

consequences of constitutionalizing that amount, of

23

suddenly we invade trust law and contract law by saying

24

there is a property interest in - - let's take a

And now, what happens, once we say there's a

constitutional interest in that?

State laws that decide for some reason not to give that

I can't quite foresee that, and I'd

6

a subject for the Takings Clause.

7

A trustee, for example, could be found to have

However, it has long been the case that if a

8

trustee earns interest, that even though he had no

9

obligation to do so in the first place, it has been

20

considered that the Takings Clause requires that interest

to be paid over, and --

no property interest here, that where this kind of a plan

3

did not exist, the lawyer himself would be able to merge

4

all clients' funds that could not individually make a

5

profit and keep whatever interest comes.

6

that's not what the common law would normally provide,

that that interest would be considered the property of the

individual clients who ponied up the money.

I worry that if we hold that there is

there would be no basis for such a rule, I assume.

MR. SAMP:

13

seems to me that - -

14

QUESTION:

I agree with you completely, and it

But Mr. Samp, I thought that the --

15

once I -- tell me if this is a wrong fix on the case, that

16

it was a question between who was going to get this money,

17

the Texas fund or the bank, that in no event was it going

18

to enrich the lawyer or the client, so there were two

1

choices.

20

If IOLTA's okay, the fund gets the money, but not the

21

lawyer and not the client in any event.

22

was the basic premise of this whole thing.

23

If IOLTA is no good, the bank gets the money.

MR. SAMP:

I thought that

Perhaps that was a premise back in

24

1 76, at a time when interest could not effectively be

25

earned on accounts.

However, there is a difference

between a bank having free use of money and a bank paying

2

interest and then deciding who gets that money.
Interest is an actual payment of money for the

3

use of funds.

That has been this Court's definition --

But that's --

Well, assume that's still the premise

of this case..

QUESTION:

Yes.

12

interest when we stipulate that he could never get that

13

interest?

14

As Justice Ginsburg outlined it, why does the

MR. SAMP:

I don't believe he has an investment -

15

backed expectation, and that goes to the issue of whether

16

there is a taking.

17

does have a very legitimate expectation that any interest

18

that is earned will be his, and that's why this should be

19

considered to be his property.

He has not invested anything here.

He

But once that issue is reached, then, of course,

20
21

we have to consider whether the per se taking rule

applies.

23

is a reasonable investment-backed expectation would be one

24

of a number of factors that would be taken into account in

25

determining whether there is a taking, but I don't believe

If not, then the issue of whether or not there

1

that we need to show that there was any kind of reasonable

2

investment-backed expectation in order to prevail on the

3

issue today, which is whether or not this is property in

4

the first place.

5

QUESTION:

Well, why wouldn't your case be

6

basically the same even if there were no IOLTA and the

7

banks were simply getting the benefit of the deposit?
It's true, the banks would not be going through

8

9

the formality of paying itself interest, but you would

10

have, it seems to me, exactly the same property claim that

11

you've got here.
MR. SAMP:

12

The banking industry has always been

13

subject to regulation, and if they are prohibited from

14

paying interest, we don't claim that we would have any

sort of claim.

So interest follows principal only if

there is a background practice of paying interest.

21

MR. SAMP:

Any interest that is paid follows

principal.

23

there is no right to accrued interest for the use of one's

24

money, and we don't claim that that's any kind of

That is the rule.

Going back to your question, Justice Scalia, it

1

2

seems to me that it's very easy to foresee many examples

3

where the Government, for example, might come in and say

4

that you're not gardening in your backyard, why don't we

come in and grow a vegetable garden there.
And I'd say, well, I want to exclude you, and

6

7

they say, well, it would cost you too much to buy the

8

fertilizer for the backyard, so you can't do it

9

profitably, but we buy our fertilizer in bulk, so we can

10

do it more profitably, let us use it since you're not

11

doing it otherwise, and it would seem to me that a

use the garden that way.

3

MR. SAMP:

The -- it's not the Constitution, it

4

is common law and State law that has always said that the

5

earnings of a fund, the earnings of property are the

6

property of those who own the fund that generate it.

7

as, because I own the garden, I own the vegetables that

8

are produced from it, so, too, because I own the fund, I

Just

own the interest that is generated by my fund.
QUESTION:

10

Yes, but because you can tell the

11

Government to get out of your yard you're in the same

12

position, it seems to me, that you're in here, when you

can say to the lawyer, give me the $1,000.

isn't stopping you from doing that.
