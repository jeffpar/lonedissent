CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Holtzman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. HOLTZMAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HOLTZMAN:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors,

may it please the Court:
The narrow issue presented by this case is

10
11

whether or not a simple exculpatory no, unelaborated upon

12

in any way, is actionable under 18 United States Code

13

1001.

14

the intention of Congress that it should be, and Congress'

15

intention is manifested by the 1934 incarnation of the

16

statute, which is basically the one that we're dealing

17

with here.

18

The answer to that question is no.

It was never

And I base my conclusions on the fact that in

19

United States v. Gilliland, a 1941 decision of this Court,

20

the Court held that the purpose of the statute, and

21

Congress' intention in passing it, was to protect the

22

authorized functions of governmental departments and

23

agencies from the perversion which might result from

24

deceptive practices which are described in the act itself.

25

QUESTION:

Well, what part of the text of the

1

act do you rely on for the exculpatory no?
MR. HOLTZMAN:

2

Well, the portion of the -- the

3

text itself does not have a provision excluding from its

4

coverage the exculpatory no.

5

However,

it's my position that you cannot

6

divorce the meaning of the statute from what it was that

7

Congress intended the function -- the statute to serve

8

and, as I say, the Court in Gilliland recognized that, and

9

most recently in United States v. Woodward the Court again

10

indicated that that was the purpose of the statute and the

11

intention with which the statute was passed by the

12

Congress.

13

And,

indeed,

I might also add that United States

14

v. Lambert, which is a Circuit Court of Appeals case, the

15

perversion of governmental function was characterized as

16

the hallmark of a 1001 violation.

17

It's the petitioner's position that a simple

18

exculpatory no made in response to a Federal agent's

19

question as to whether or not the individual committed a

20

particular crime cannot have the effect of perverting

21

governmental functioning and,

22

there ensued a landscape of jurisdiction which came to be

23

conveniently called the exculpatory no doctrine which

24

began in the 1950's in the district courts and then the

25

Fifth Circuit in United States v. Paternostro in the early

Mr. Holtzman, may I clarify what your

It's not that you're saying it isn't a false
Are you saying it isn't -- it can't be
Is that -MR. HOLTZMAN:

6

No.

My point is that --my point

7

is that the statement is false, or the statement can be

8

false -QUESTION:

9

So if it's in the words, makes any

10

false statement -- but there's materially before that,

11

I was supposing maybe that's what you meant.
MR. HOLTZMAN:

12

13

I think that's the new

statute, Your Honor.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. HOLTZMAN:

16

No,

so

Yes.
As opposed to the one that's the

subject --

17

QUESTION:

Make any false statement.

18

MR. HOLTZMAN:

Yes.

The statute that we're

19

talking about is basically the 1934 incarnation of the

20

statute, which had some subsequent changes but not of any

21

significance in connection with the issues involved in

22

this case.

23

thereto,

24

got divided up into two separate sections of the code.

25

In 1948, for example, the statute which, prior

included false claims as well as false statements

1

dealing with is any false statement.
MR. HOLTZMAN:

2

Yes.

In fact, actually the

3

statute, Your Honor, says false -- when it refers to oral

4

utterances refers to statements in the plural, and I'd

5

like to reserve a little time to address that very

6

directly, if I may.

7

QUESTION:

But your argument, then,

is based on

8

legislative history that, as you said, no is a false

9

statement, and nonetheless it doesn't come under the

10

words, any false statement because?
MR. HOLTZMAN:

11

Well, the courts have interpreted

12

statement to mean those statements which are capable of

13

perverting governmental functioning, and therefore the use

14

of the term statement in the statute cannot refer to the

15

type of statement that we're talking about, namely, the

16

exculpatory no.

17
18

QUESTION:

Well, this Court hasn't said that,

certainly.

19

MR. HOLTZMAN:

20

QUESTION:

MR. HOLTZMAN:

22

specifically, but in --

23

QUESTION:

Pardon me?

This Court has never said that.
This Court has not said that

And in fact it is quite extraordinary

24

that a court would take this rather simple language and

25

derive some other meaning from it, isn't it?

I mean, we have plenty of cases from this Court

1
2

precedent saying the first thing we do is look at the

3

language of the statute.
MR. HOLTZMAN:

4

I'm not disagreeing with that

5

proposition as a general matter.

What I am saying,

6

however, is that this Court has repeatedly recognized that

7

where the application of the statute, plain meaning

8

application of the statute would pervert or thwart
Congress' intent or produce absurd results, then there is

10

the - QUESTION:

11
12

13

What would be absurd about the result

here?
MR. HOLTZMAN:

Well,

the absurd result that

14

would ensue here is the fact that, as Gilliland indicated,

15

the purpose of the statute, or the intention of the

16

Congress was to prevent the perversion of governmental

17

functioning.

18

The kind of --

QUESTION:

Well, Gilliland gives this Court's

1

opinion as to what Congress' intent was, but that simply

20

doesn't prevail over the language of the statute, which,

21

as Justice Ginsburg points out, your client's answer is

22

clearly within it.

23

MR. HOLTZMAN:

No -- well,

I respectfully

24

disagree on this ground.

25

eight circuits took the position that I'm articulating, to

That's why we granted certiorari,

the other circuits.

that question.

7
8

That's why we're here, to resolve

MR. HOLTZMAN:

Yes, I understand that.

I

understand that very well.

9

The point that I was trying to make was that the

10

exculpatory no,

11

is incapable of, as a matter of law, and so the circuits

12

have held, of perverting governmental functioning.

13
14

in the context that we're talking about,

QUESTION:

But there's no requirement in the

statute that it pervert the governmental function.

15

MR. HOLTZMAN:

No, but this Court, as I say, has

16

held in Gilliland that that is what the statute is about,

17

that the statute was passed with the intention of

18

preventing and punishing those false statements the effect

19

of which is to pervert governmental functioning, and the

20

juris -- this -- the juris -- excuse me, the jurisprudence

21

that has grown up surrounding this has pointed directly to

22

that.

In other words, that the reference to the term

the potency, the power to undermine governmental

2

Well, does that mean that in every

3

case in which the officer who hears the false statement

4

knows that it is false, that the false statement is

5

therefore outside the statute?
MR. HOLTZMAN:

6

In substance, yes,

it does,

7

because as the lower courts have indicated, that an

8

experienced Federal agent, when he hears the exculpatory

9

no, especially in this case -- this presents perhaps a

10

wonderful context in which to view it -- didn't ask the

11

question, and doesn't normally ask the question as to

whether or not the individual has committed the crime in

statement.

technique.
MR. HOLTZMAN:

Well, it is an investigatory-

3

technique in the sense that, certainly in this case, this

4

was a prelude, so to speak, to induce the cooperation of

5

the petitioner to perhaps testify against other

6

individuals that the Government had evidence against were

7

culpable in connection with this acceptance either of

8

bribes or gratuities.

9

QUESTION:

But in any case, whether there is or

10

is not a statutory violation is a function of the

11

governmental agent's state of mind.

MR. HOLTZMAN:

No, it's not a function of the

Oh,

I thought it was, because I

15

thought you said that if the governmental agent who hears

16

the false answer knows it's false, that it therefore does

not fall within the violation --

Well, certainly under those

circumstances it does not fall within them.

So I assume the state of mind of the

a wild goose chase or, in the alternative,

QUESTION:

5

MR. HOLTZMAN:

6

Well,

Mr. Holtzman --

-- the investigative work that he

normally does.
QUESTION:

7

-- in the Bryson case we said our

8

legal system provides methods for challenging the

9

Government's right to ask questions, but lying isn't one

10
11

of them.

Now, what's your response to that?
MR. HOLTZMAN:

Well, my response to that is,

12

first of all I don't take the position that lies are

13

protected as a general proposition.

14

Government took the view that the Fifth Amendment does not

15

protect lies.

16

I think that the

I might say that the exculpatory no

17

jurisprudence,

18

considerations from Gilliland, have also expressed a

19

solicitude for the Fifth Amendment, although they've

20

never -- no court that I know of has indicated that a

21

violation of the Fifth Amendment occurs as a result of

22

cornering a suspect into either, on the one hand

23

incriminating himself, which is somewhat incompatible with

24

the accusatorial nature of our system of justice or, on

25

the other hand, committing a 1001 violation.

QUESTION:

Well, he can just be quiet, can't he?

2

MR. HOLTZMAN:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. HOLTZMAN:

Well --

That's what Bryson said.
Well,

in Bryson there's a

5

distinction because of the fact that -- as I recall the

6

facts in Bryson -- I think we're talking also perhaps

7

about Knox as well -- there was the opportunity by the

8

individuals in those cases to contest the questions that

9

they wound up answering falsely.
In other words,

10

in Bryson,

if I remember

11

correctly, it was a situation in which the individual had

12

to file an affidavit with the NLRB indicating that he was

13

not a communist.

14

filing of tax forms with respect to gambling earnings and

15

employees, et cetera.

16

In Knox it was a case involving the

And in each of those cases certainly there's a

17

distinguishing factor in that each of those individuals

18

had the opportunity, by the process of litigation,

19

will, rather than being confronted by agents in their

20

house, of litigating the propriety of the questions being

21

posed to them and whether or not --

MR. HOLTZMAN:

Well, the circumstances were such

here -QUESTION:

Do you have any reason to believe

they would have won the litigation in those other two

cases?

MR. HOLTZMAN:

I don't know.

I think in one of

those cases -QUESTION:

9

I don't --

MR. HOLTZMAN:

10

I don't -- I think in one of

11

those cases there was an indication, and perhaps in both

12

of them that there was an indication that subsequent case

13

law indicated that the individuals in those cases would

14

ultimately have prevailed had they taken that course.

15

That is my recollection of those cases.
QUESTION:

16

That is not my recollection, and not

exculpatory no response perverts that function, and I

suppose that one way in which I can dramatically

illustrate it is the Rogers case.

to hold that, by the way.

No, no,

I'm not asking the Court

I'd like to make that clear.

What I'm saying is that certainly there are

14

Fifth Amendment implications in this, as recognized by the

15

circuit courts of appeals over the course of 30 years and

16

while, as I said moments ago, no court of appeals has said

17

that this practice violates the Fifth Amendment, certainly

18

the courts have said that it comes uncomfortably close to

19

doing that.

20

And I don't know that the opinions of all of

21

these courts of appeals on that subject, namely the notion

22

of coming uncomfortably close, that the Government is

23

going to corner you and either force you in effect to

24

incriminate yourself or, alternatively, violate another

25

criminal statute, especially where there's an opportunity,

that, where you can have all kinds of absurd results.

MR. HOLTZMAN:

9

Well,

I might say to Your Honor

10

that if he had been advised of that, that might be all the

11

more reason to tell the truth.
The Government, of course,

12

I might say had a

13

theory about this case, namely that it was a continuing

14

offense, and that therefore the statute of limitations

15

hadn't passed, although the district court ultimately

16

ruled that it had.

17

But what I'm suggesting to Your Honor is that if

18

this statute is permitted to be wielded in this way,

19

disregard, in effect, of what the intention of Congress

20

was in enacting it, then you have a situation in which it

21

is subject to tremendous abuse, and I might also

No.

I cannot -- I can't -- and I

As I say, the exculpatory no jurisprudence

this statute was to operate, and one of the ways it was

not intend, was for this statute to be used in the fashion

governmental functioning, and it's from that point of

The most abusive is to take a

situation, for example, such as existed in this case, in

which ultimately Judge Bryant in the district court held

that the statute of limitations had passed with respect to

a new crime.
MR. HOLTZMAN:

10

You could say that, but on the

11

other hand, you can also see that there is a widespread

12

opportunity for abuse if the statute is permitted to be

13

used in this fashion and, as I say, it was not Congress'

intention, and it may be that there is only one sentence

in Gilliland, but the sentence, Your Honor, Mr. Chief

that could result from the Government's interpretation.

MR. HOLTZMAN:

You could take a situation, for

Are you relying at all, Mr. Holtzman,

on what might have happened if he were taken in custody

11

and asked a question, and then he would have gotten

Miranda warning and could have had a lawyer there?

MR. HOLTZMAN:

different situation, obviously, but I won't take the

were developing was close to an entrapment kind of

argument that the Government -- you used the word corners,

I think.

MR. HOLTZMAN:

Yes, and I think there is an

element of that, undoubtedly, just as there is an element

22

of -- as the circuit courts have articulated, of coming

23

uncomfortably close to a violation of the Fifth Amendment,

But even in cases where we prosecute a mere

exculpatory no is so obscure and, notwithstanding the

12

representation that there is some wall of authority out

there by the court of appeals recognizing it, which in our

view more resembles a rubble than a wall, it simply is not

Is there any such thing?

It doesn't fit the

it's not a very serious crime, but is there also some

concern with abusive use of this question?

GENERAL WAXMAN:

don't want to suggest that an exculpatory no, or, just to

GENERAL WAXMAN:

it's interesting, at the

materiality was an element of the false statement prong of

the statute as it had previously existed.

It was aimed at procurement, getting money from

16

It's not something that has arisen under the perjury

it can prove a knowing,

judicial matter, and it's something that comes within 1621

General Waxman, perjury is a

Well,

it's what -- insofar as

what the judge allowed into the record it's what happened

it's also why this prosecution was not even in fact

The latter question is

The former question is a mixed

question of fact and law, and in order for the Government

to convict somebody with respect to a false no in response

to the former question, presumably we would have to prove

that the defendant knew the elements of the crime of

bribery.

QUESTION:

General Waxman,

in addition to

prosecutorial discretion which you've been assuring us

about, this is a felony, and you're entitled to a jury

trial, am I not right about that?

Yes.

And would you want to prosecute

somebody for rolling through a stop sign and making the

(Laughter.)

You think it would enhance your record as

No, and it would be an

incredible waste of resources.

This is a statute which I think the record shows

very responsible fashion.

notwithstanding all the years that this has been in
