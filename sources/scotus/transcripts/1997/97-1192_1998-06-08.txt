ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES HAMILTON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. HAMILTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

On Sunday, July 11, 1993, at 10:00 a.m. in the

12

morning, Vince Foster came to my home to consult me as a

13

lawyer in the Travel Office matter, which was then the

14

matter of intense public controversy.

15

We spoke alone for 2 hours, during which time I

16

took three pages of notes, which are the subject of this

17

litigation here today.

18

Before we began, Mr. Foster asked me if the

19

conversation was privileged and, without hesitation, I

20

said that it was.

21

be privileged had Mr. Foster not taken his own life 9 days

22

later in Fort Marcy Park, Virginia.

23

It is not disputed that my notes would

Mr. Chief Justice, I wish to make five major

24

points this morning which I would like to summarize

25

briefly at the outset.

First, any balancing test or

1

ruling that leaves the existence of the attorney-client

2

privilege after death in doubt would have a significant

3

chilling effect on client candor, particularly as to those

4

who expect to die soon, because people do care about their

5

reputations and the fate of family and friends after

6

death.
Secondly, Independent Counsel's central

7
8

contention that only the perjurer would be chilled if the
privilege does not survive but not the truthful client, or

10

the client intending to invoke his Fifth Amendment

11

privilege, is contrary to reason and experience and is

12

unsupported by any decision of this Court.
Third, the conclusion that the privilege should

13
14

survive in civil cases but not in criminal cases is

15

illogical and unworkable and is supported by no case, no

16

statute, or no commentator.

17

Fourth, all the pertinent State statutes

18

recognize and virtually all of the nontestator cases hold

1

that the privilege survives death, and the testator cases

20

generally recognize that they apply an exception to the

21

general rule that is intended to effectuate the testator's

22

intent.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

It's an exception that pretty much

swallows up the rule though, isn't it?
MR. HAMILTON:

Well -4

QUESTION:

1

2

I mean, like 95 percent of the cases

involve the exception to the rule.
MR. HAMILTON:

3

Justice Scalia, that is correct,

4

but they apply to a very specific situation, when there is

5

a will contest, where there is a question about the

6

testator's intent.

7

QUESTION:

It's very specific, but it also

8

happens to be the situation that is most likely to arise

9

with respect to privilege as to a decedent.

10

MR. HAMILTON:

11

QUESTION:

12

Justice Souter --

It's precisely the situation most

likely to arise.
MR. HAMILTON:

13

Justice Scalia, it is certainly

14

the situation that has arisen most in the past.

15

suggest, though, that if the court's opinion below is

16

upheld, the situation will arise much more in the criminal

17

context.
QUESTION:

18

I would

How many cases upholding the

19

privilege uphold it, uphold it against either a demand by

20

a prosecutor in the -- in a criminal case, or a grand jury

21

request?
MR. HAMILTON:

22

There are only two cases that I

23

know of.

One is the case here.

The other is the case in

24

Massachusetts, the case -- the case involved a John Doe,

25

as it is styled.

QUESTION:

1

Counsel, I recognize that the time

2

frame for your briefing was compressed, but I think there

3

may be at least a misimpression left by your footnote 22

4

at page 21 and it bears, too, on Judge Tatel's discussion

5

and it bears, too, on your opening remarks that the States

6

say the privilege does not survive.

7

In California, at least, and that's one of the

8

States you cite in the footnote, the privilege does expire

9

when the estate's closed, and that's been so for 35 years,

10

and I have not found anything in the literature indicating

11

that in California this has caused, number 1, any lack --

12

any diminishment in the number of lawyers, or in their

13

effectiveness in representing their clients.

14

And so I think it's a very important distinction

15

to say that the privilege can be exercised pending the

16

administration of the estate, and then it closes, and if

17

the other States, or some of them, are like California,

18

that is, it seems to me, a very significant indication

19

that experience has shown that this is not a problem.
MR. HAMILTON:

20

Justice Kennedy, I believe that

21

California is the only jurisdiction that has that specific

22

reservation or provision -QUESTION:

23
24

problem?

25

do not?

Have other States addressed the

Can you say that the other States specifically

MR. HAMILTON:

1

2

find that they do not.
I would also point out that there are a number

3
4

of States --

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. HAMILTON:

7

That they do not address the point.
That they -- well, that they do

not specifically address the point.
QUESTION:

8
9

Our study of the State statutes

Well, and if the administrator of the

estate is designated as the one to exercise the privilege,

10

then that means the lawyer alone would not be able to

11

exercise it, so it seems to me you can infer that it

12

expires.
MR. HAMILTON:

13

Justice Kennedy,

in a number of

14

States, close to 20 States,

15

say that the lawyer also can assert the privilege, not

16

just the personal representative but the lawyer also and,

17

of course, that indicates that the survival of the

18

privilege has nothing to do with the winding up of the

19

estate.
QUESTION:

20

the State provisions apply, or

But if I'm correct about California,

21

you would agree that that is relevant in considering

22

whether or not experience shows that this causes a

23

problem.

24
25

MR. HAMILTON:

I will agree that it is a

relevant factor.

I should point out that there is a California

1

2

case, the Pena case that we cite in our brief, where this

3

particular statute was applied in a criminal case, not

4

just in a civil case relating to the administration of the

5

estate.

6

QUESTION:

Was that post the 1965 California

7

amendment, do you know?

8

MR. HAMILTON:

9

I believe it was, but I'll have

to check the date of the case --

10

QUESTION:

All right.

I'll check that.

11

Well, in any event, in your brief and in a

12

number of the amicus briefs it's stated that what the

13

Independent Counsel is requesting here is very sweeping

14

and unprecedented, but we have at least California, we

15

have Pennsylvania, we have the ALI, which speaks for

16

lawyers, we have all of the commentators except Wigmore, I

17

think, and we have, as Justice Scalia points out, the

18

privilege that in any event is inapplicable when estates

19

and property are concerned.

20

It's inapplicable if there's an ongoing scheme

21

that the attorney is consulted for in order to continue.

22

It's inapplicable as to fees, inapplicable as to clients

23

who dispute what the attorney told them and that the

24

clients then are in dispute and, also, the privilege that

25

we're talking about here is one only as to compelled

1

testimony.

2

continues.
And so it seems to me that this not the sweeping

3
4

The attorney's ethical duty to remain silent

change that the amicus briefs and that you indicate.
MR. HAMILTON:

5

Well, there certainly are some

6

exceptions that you have mentioned, but so far, with the

7

exception of this case and the one case in Pennsylvania,

8

there has been no case that has found that in a

9

nontestamentary situation that the privilege expires when

10

the client dies, and I would suggest, as I suggested to

11

Justice Scalia, that if this Court upholds the lower court

12

decision we will have many, many more cases that will

13

raise this particular issue.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

It hasn't happened in California for

35 years.
MR. HAMILTON:

But if the Supreme Court of the

17

United States announces that the privilege expires upon

18

death, I think that we will find many, many more cases

19

raising this particular issue.

20

QUESTION:

21
22

May I ask if the California statute

has been construed by the California supreme court?
MR. HAMILTON:

By the California supreme court?

23

It was construed by a California court of appeals in 1984.

24

It was applied in a criminal case to bar the testimony of

25

an attorney.

QUESTION:

It barred the testimony --

MR. HAMILTON:

QUESTION:

4

MR. HAMILTON:

5

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- in a case construing the statute?
Yes.

Judge Williams did say further, in

6

some States the privilege does not survive the winding up

7

of an estate, and cited California for that proposition.

3

I know it isn't part of this record, Mr. Hamilton, but is

9

the Foster estate wound up?
MR. HAMILTON:

10
11
12

The Foster estate is not wound

up.
QUESTION:

But the period of claims is 3 months,

13

the period for filing claims against the estate is 3

14

months in Arkansas?

15

MR. HAMILTON:

I believe that is correct.

16

far as I know, no claims have been filed against the

17

Estate, but it's not been finally wound up.

18

20

QUESTION:

As

But if this were California you would

be able to assert the privilege, is that right?
I mean, assuming that you read the California

2L

words, Personal Representative, to mean someone who ceases

22

to exist when the estate closes, which I don't know

23

whether that's true or not, but assuming that that is

24

true, because here the estate isn't closed, it would be

25

proper to assert the privilege, even under California's -10

MR. HAMILTON:

2

I -- if the question is whether

3

the attorney is the Personal Representative, I don't

4

believe the statutes have been interpreted that way,

5

Justice Breyer.
QUESTION:

6

No, it says in California that if

7

there is -- you can't claim the privilege if there is no

8

holder of the privilege in existence, and the holder of
the privilege is defined as a Personal Representative of

10

the client, so if you were to construe that as saying the

11

privilege dies after the estate's closed, still you'd be

12

able to assert it here because the estate hasn't closed.

13

MR. HAMILTON:

That's correct.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Hamilton --

15

QUESTION:

Well, unless only the holder can

16

assert it.

Is it clear under California law that someone

17

other than the holder of the privilege can assert the

18

privilege?
MR. HAMILTON:

1

Well,- under California law the

20

Personal Representative is the one who can assert the

21

privilege.

22

QUESTION:

And no one else.

QUESTION:

No, no, that's --

MR. HAMILTON:

The attorney is not -- under

California law the attorney is not given the right to

assert the privilege.

QUESTION:

now in front of me.

the lawyer who received or made the communication subject

know that -- that's section 955.

I'm not -- are you sure?

I'm reading it quickly, but it says

MR. HAMILTON:

QUESTION:

13

I have this

At the California law.

Yes, so I'm not certain that the

lawyer couldn't assert it.

14

MR. HAMILTON:

Well, certainly -- certainly,

15

Justice Breyer, in many States the lawyer can assert the

16

privilege.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Hamilton, you take the position

18

that there can be no compelled testimony by someone in

19

your circumstances even if the information would be

20

essential to show that a third person was not guilty of a

21

crime, such as in the Macumber case in Arizona.

22

23
24
25

You say even in those circumstances there's no
way to get at the information.
MR. HAMILTON:

Is that right?

Justice O'Connor, what we said

was this, that in a situation where a defendant's rights

are at issue and where denying a defendant access to

2

certain information might unconstitutionally arbitrarily

3

and disproportionately infringe upon his or her right to

4

weigh the evidence, perhaps the Court in that situation --

QUESTION:

the material can be reviewed, do we?

Well, we don't even know that unless

correct.

9

Well, that is correct.

That is

You don't know that.
QUESTION:

And you don't oppose reviewing it if

10

a defendant in some other case needs the information, or

11

says he needs it?

12

MR. HAMILTON:

If there was some demonstration

13

that evidence in the hands of an attorney would be crucial

14

to a defendant's right in this situation I would not

15

oppose in camera review.

So you make an exception for criminal

cases.

QUESTION:

I would make an -

There goes your absolute rule that

you can't draw a distinction between civil and criminal.

You're willing to make a distinction between criminal to

QUESTION:

MR. HAMILTON:

But that's still a criminal case.
That is still -- that is still a

criminal case.
QUESTION:

Let's put it in the context, why just

5

the defendant's rights?

I mean, let's put it in the

6

context of your client and, as you know, there are

7

conspiracy theorists who believe that his death was not a

8

suicide but in fact was murder.
You acknowledge that if his evidence was

10

necessary to prove that it was not his wife who committed

11

the murder, that that indeed might be able to come in, but

12

what if his evidence was necessary to prove that somebody

13

else committed the murder?

importance.

administration of justice.

It is important so clients will go to their

Now, if we have a rule that a1bows the privilege

to be broken whenever a prosecutor or a grand jury feels

that he or it needs the information to pursue who

value.
Obviously, here, we have a balancing, if you

12

will, of interest, the interest in having lawyers speak to

13

their clients with candor and the interest of getting to

14

the truth, but all of the privileges that we have

15

recognize that to some degree, to some degree they will

inhibit the search for information.

3

Even if you yourself thought that the

4

information was really crucial to you, you would have to

say, nobody can let it out.
MR. HAMILTON:

6

That's extraordinary.

Justice Scalia, in this

7

particular situation I do believe the Personal

Representative of Mr. Foster's estate could waive the

privilege.

QUESTION:

Is the doctor-patient privilege

different in that respect, on death?

In terms of -- in terms of who

can waive it?

QUESTION:

Yes.

15

MR. HAMILTON:

I would think -- Justice

16

Ginsburg, we have not briefed that particular issue but I

17

would think that in that circumstance also the Personal

18

Representative of the estate could waive.

QUESTION:

But you --

QUESTION:

Is there authority for either of

21

those propositions, that the Personal Representative of

the estate could waive either the physician-patient

privilege or the lawyer-client privilege, or is this just

kind of speculation on your part?

the proposition that the Personal Executive can waive the

MR. HAMILTON:

QUESTION:

By virtute of statute.
And in other jurisdictions, too.

By virtue of statute.

10

MR. HAMILTON:

11

QUESTION:

12

And in other --

Yes.

Yes.

Wouldn't you suppose, though, that

the extent of the waiver would be limited by the extent of

3

the Personal Representative's authority, which I guess I

4

have always assumed is essentially authority over

5

property, so that if we're concerned about reputational

6

protection absent a statute, I would suppose the Personal

7

Representative could not waive it.

8

MR. HAMILTON:

9

Well, the cases are not very

specific on that, but there is at least some implication

20

privilege, and so the attorney's testimony was available

3

to the court.

And it so happened in that situation that the

court decided that the testimony was untrustworthy for a

number of reasons, and it was not admitted into evidence,

but there --

9

QUESTION:

But that came at the initiative of

the attorneys, did it not?

I mean, if they had -- they

10

had this confidence that had been made to them, but the

11

defendant never would have found out about it had it not

12

been for the attorneys for the other client.

13

MR. HAMILTON:

Well, in that situation the

14

attorneys did seek guidance from the bar to see what they

15

could do, so I think it is fair to say that the attorneys

16

had something to do with --

17

QUESTION:

Your typical defendant in a criminal

18

case is simply -- in a lot of -- they're simply

19

to know of the existence of this evidence, so -- if the

20

privilege obtains, and that presumably is -- if the

21

privilege does obtain, that's the way it ought to be.

22

MR. HAMILTON:

not going

Well, they may or they may not.

23

I mean, we don't know what a deceased person has told some

24

third party, so it's hard to speculate as to what someone

25

might know, Mr. Chief Justice.

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Hamilton, you said you had five

2

points, and you got out four, so we'd like to hear what

3

the fifth one was.

4

MR. HAMILTON:

The fifth one was this, Justice

5

Ginsburg.

6

notion that even seasoned attorneys do not exercise any

7

professional judgment in taking notes during an initial

8

client interview is contrary to reason and experience,

9

it's without case support, and it is contrary to the facts

10

As to work product, the court of appeals'

of this particular case.

11

I would like to go back to my point that persons

12

will not talk with a lawyer with candor if they know that,

13

when they die, what they say can be discovered by a

14

prosecutor.

15

said that the purpose of the privilege is to encourage

16

clients to talk to their lawyers in a candid fashion.

17

Over and over and over again this Court has

QUESTION:

I think this is very important and I

18

want to pursue it with you a little, but as you begin, I'm

19

thinking back to the errors on a case, the Macumber case.

20

You indicate that one of the situations where the

21

confidence might be disclosable is when the client

22

confesses a crime and then someone else is charged with

23

the crime after the death.

24

So that's the instance where the confidentiality

25

is most important in -- to encouraging the disclosure, and

yet we have -- you admitted the possibility, in any event,

2

that it would be discoverable.

3

MR. HAMILTON:

In the extreme situation where a

4

defendant's rights would be unconstitutionally,

5

arbitrarily and disproportionately infringed upon, a court

6

might find an exception.

7
8

QUESTION:

And the paradigm example of that is

when the client confesses the crime to the attorney.
MR. HAMILTON:

That is the paradigm example but,

10

Justice Kennedy, that is not this case.

As I was saying, the candor rationale has been

20

QUESTION:

What do you -- what's the classic

21

instance in which the attorney really should know

something in order to help the client, but that the

23

attorney would not hear this?

if the Independent Counsel's position prevailed.

the classic example, do you think?

What's

1

MR. HAMILTON:

2

QUESTION:

3
4

Well, I think --

It can't be confession of the crime,

can't be property.
MR. HAMILTON:

I think you can think of many

5

hypotheticals where a client might be disinclined to

6

reveal something to an attorney if the client knew that

7

after death it might be revealed to the prosecutor.

8

9

I mean, in this situation an attorney would have
to say, well, I would like for you to tell me the facts,

10

but don't tell me what's really bad, what's really bad,

11

because if you die I may have to reveal this to a

12

prosecutor.

3

So I think you can come up with many

4

hypotheticals where a client might not want to reveal some

5

facts to the attorney.

6

Let me just give you a specific one that I used

7

in the court of appeals.

What if we have a father who is

8

dying, and he wants to consult a lawyer about the criminal

9

drug problems of his child.

Now, in this circumstance the

20

dying father will know that as soon as he passes away some

21

prosecutor might be able to get to the information that he

22

has imparted to his lawyer and, in that circumstance, I

23

think that candor would be chilled, because the father is

24

not going to want to say things --

25

QUESTION:

Why does the father have to do that?

Can't he just say, I want a spendthrift trust for my son,

2

my son has got some problems.

3

MR. HAMILTON:

4

QUESTION:

That's all he needs to say.

Well, he may not --

Because you're presuming that there's

5

something that's very necessary for the attorney to know

6

that the client won't be able to tell, and I don't see

7

that in that hypothetical.

8

9

MR. HAMILTON:

Justice Kennedy, the father may

not come to the lawyer about some estate problem, may not

10

come to the lawyer to set up a trust.

11

to the lawyer to consult about the criminal problems of

12

his son, because he is concerned about him and he needs

13

advice as to how these matters should be handled.

14

QUESTION:

Certainly many lawyers are kind of

family confidantes, as well as just advisors on purely

legal matters, I suspect.

Well, that, of course, is true.

MR. KAVANAUGH:

9

That will mean that innocent

people will be wrongly convicted and guilty people will be

11

wrongly exonerated, each of which implicates a substantial

12

societal interest.

13

exemplary of that point.

14

QUESTION:

The case of State v. Macumber is

Mr. Kavanaugh, we've been just told

15

by Mr. Hamilton that he wouldn't take it to that extreme,

16

where it's a question of a defendant who was convicted --

17

who's charged with a crime, and the information was that

18

some other person had done that and the lawyer knew that.

19

He did not press his case to that extreme, so I

think it would be useful if you curtailed your argument to

the one that Mr. Hamilton is making on behalf of the

consulting his attorney before death will not have the

2

expectation of confidentiality on which their entire

3

theory is premised.

4

QUESTION:

No, you're only leaving out the case

6

consultations between lawyers and clients where the client

7

does not confess to a crime.
MR. KAVANAUGH:

8

9

That's right, Justice Stevens,

but the most likely issue about which a client might

10

consult an attorney in which the communications might be

11

sought after death are testamentary cases, and in that

12

circumstance the law has long established -- over a

century in this Court -- that the privilege does not

You can't assume all consultations

Generally, we presume people are innocent unless somebody

proves otherwise.

QUESTION:

1

That is the background assumption, on

2

the cases you describe all say they are exceptions from

3

the general rule.
MR. KAVANAUGH:

4

Exceptions from the general rule

5

of attorney-client privilege.

It's not exceptions from a

6

general rule about what happens to the privilege after

7

death, the most prevalent rule after death.

8

thing we know that is settled with respect to posthumous

9

privilege is that the privilege does not apply in the vast

The only

10

majority of cases in which it's raised, namely,

11

testamentary cases.

12

QUESTION:

No, but does that prove very much for

13

your side, because the theory of the testamentary

14

exception is that the client would, in fact, want the

15

lawyer to talk for the purpose of implementing whatever

16

the client's intent was.
The assumption seems to be that there's a point

17
18

to which the client wants to go.

That was the object of

19

the will or the trust, or what-not, and so in fact the

20

theory behind that exception is really that the client

21

authorizes it.

22

You're arguing for the converse case, in which

23

we assume the client would not, so what does that prove?
MR. KAVANAUGH:

Souter.

First, as Judge Williams and Judge Wald stated in

1

the court of appeals opinion, that rationale for the

2

testamentary exception simply does not work.

3

know whether, in intending for a particular property

4

distribution, the testator intended that his or her

5

attorney-client communications also be disclosed to

6

fulfill that property intent, so --

7

QUESTION:

We don't

Well, we may not in the sense that in

8

this case there is in fact a statement that can be

9

attributed to the client saying, I want you to talk or I

10

don't want you to talk, but it seems to me there is a

11

reasonable argument that the client wants the object of

12

his testamentary intent to be served and if in order to

13

serve it, it is necessary to disclose something, it's

14

reasonable to suppose the client would want the

15

disclosure.

16

I think that's as far as the theory goes.

17

MR. KAVANAUGH:

Well, it may be reasonable to

18

suppose but most believe that that's the one situation

19

above all others where clients would be chilled to

20

nondisclosure by the possibility of posthumous disclosure

21

of the attorney-client communications, and if we're going

22

to presume intent in that context, why do we not also

23

presume intent in this context:

24

near death would want to fulfill what this Court has

25

called his basic obligation as a citizen to provide

presume that a person

information to the grand jury?

2

And even on the facts of this case --

3

QUESTION:

Because there are a great many people

4

who know they have that obligation, or at least that there

5

is a general theory that they have that obligation, but

6

they do not, in fact, want to fulfill it.

7

I mean, we're being realistic, I think.

8

MR. KAVANAUGH:

9

Well, it's again what we should

presume someone's intent to be, and if we presume it in

10

the testamentary context, even though it's going to be

11

embarrassing information about one's family members, it

12

could cause great harm --

13

QUESTION:

Well, if I may interrupt you, I think

14

it's the difference between a presumption of fact and a

15

presumption of law.

16

I mean, in the testamentary case, we figure in

17

fact the fellow wants to accomplish something.

18

going to presume it in this case, I think it probably

19

would have to be a presumption of law quite divorced from

20

any specific actual intent on the part of the client

21

because we know that if embarrassment would in fact result

22

to the client's reputation, to living individuals,

23

probably the client would not want that disclosed.

Do you have it?
This Court has stated repeatedly

6

that privileges obstruct the search for truth and thus

must be strictly construed, so to the extent there's a

burden with respect to a legal issue, we would suppose

that the burden would be on petitioners to establish what

realize that you dispute this, but if we assume, in fact,

the understanding of the profession has been, at least for

a very long time, that there is a privilege as broad as

Now, when you say a criminal case, do

you mean a case where the statement made by the client to

death, or they could end it when the estate is wound up.
In your earlier questions, Justice Kennedy,

3

about the estate being wound up, that rule shows that the

4

rationale behind winding it up on the estate, ending the

5

privilege when the estate winds up, means that interests

6

and reputation, and interests and protecting others, are

7

not what justifies the privilege after death.

8

9

It is simply to protect the financial interests
of the estate and, thus, those codes which have been in

10

the proposed Federal rule and the Model Code of Evidence,

11

the rationale for those codes, limitation and duration and

12

scope, support our position when that rationale is

translated to the criminal --

14

QUESTION:

I think that perhaps understates

the -- one reason which I think is generally agreed to,

that the client must feel free to tell the lawyer, you

the extent that the court finds an interest in

QUESTION:

But even on the work product side of

it, if you have access to the lawyer's testimony, why do

7

you need the notes?

8

9

MR. KAVANAUGH:

Because the notes may help to

show what was discussed in the conversations between

10

Mr. Foster and Mr. Hamilton and refresh Mr. Hamilton's

11

recollection.

12

13
14

QUESTION:

Well, he can use them to refresh his

recollection.
But I thought, now turning to the work product

15

side of it, that a statement that's not the witness'

16

verbatim statement, that is the most closely guarded kind

17

of work product, a lawyer's notes as distinguished from

18

his verbatim transcript of the witness' testimony.

19

MR. KAVANAUGH:

The settled case law in the

20

lower courts, Justice Ginsburg, is in situations where the

21

witness who communicated with the lawyer is unavailable,

22

then those portions of the notes that at least reflect the

23

factual statements of the witness and surrounding

information must be disclosed, even when the client, the

witness is still alive.

under Upjohn you have to make even more of a showing.

4

6

What showing did you make in this case as to the
work product?
MR. KAVANAUGH:

The showing that has to be made,

7

Mr. Chief Justice, is a showing that the witness in

8

question is no longer available for questioning, as the

9

Second and Third Circuit stated, and that is what the

10

showing is, and that's been a traditional showing in the

11

lower courts and is approved in the Restatement, that

suggest that the notes must be produced in that

That itself is a substantial showing

that the witness is no longer available?

That's correct, Mr. Chief

In Upjohn, of course, and this goes to the

20

attorney-client privilege point that Justice Ginsburg

21

raised, a fundamental pillar on which the attorney-client

privilege rests, a pillar that this Court emphasized in

You can't question the person

that?

How do you know

You haven't seen the notes.
MR. KAVANAUGH:

We don't know what's in the

notes, correct.
QUESTION:

All right.

So is it your rule that

what's supposed to happen is that after a person dies the

judge is supposed to go through the notes that his lawyer

has to see if they're subject to some other privilege or

situation you couldn't come in and say, oh, some other

QUESTION:

Why not?

You might have told the

attorney what you told your wife, or what your wife told

6

you, or what you told your psychiatrist, or what the

psychiatrist told you, or any other dozens of privileges

8

that could apply.

9

So if you're saying, I guess, that those still

10

would apply, even though they'd normally be waived when

11

you talk to somebody about them, you're asking the judge

12

to start picking and choosing among them, is there any

13

common law support, or do you find in the last 30 years,

14

even in California, any instance -- I guess you did a

you've done a lot of excellent research, and I'm saying in

the course of that research, either through conversations

or otherwise, have you found it to be a practice in

13

California, which has had this evidence code for 30 years,

14

have you found that it is the practice, have you found an

instance, either in cases or outside of cases, where

lawyers routinely or otherwise, in civil or criminal

I think it might show that the

kind of situation -- that's true, and also shows that the

5

kind of situation we have here, as the facts and the

6

statement of facts indicate, are rarely going to arise.

7

QUESTION:

Another thing it shows is the woeful

8

dearth of any empirical research in the legal profession,

9

because the kind of questions that Justice Breyer and some

10

of the rest of us asked, you know, if lawyers were polled

11

as to how they treated client confidences, and people

asked prosecutors, we would have a much better idea of how

to decide this case than, you know, AB writes a law review

answer's none, but which group of commentators or law

reformers or whatever have advocated that the rule

Right.

KAVANAUGH:

That's correct.

I want to make

one point about --

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR.

7

For 22 years,

KAVANAUGH:

-- Pennsylvania.
Justice Kennedy,

there's been

8

experience in Pennsylvania after Cohen v.

9

It's a big State with a lot of lawyers,

Jenkintown Cab.

and there's no

evidence,

11

vast resources,

even with petitioners and their amici and their
of any chilling going on in the

QUESTION:

Do you have the -- what I'm quite

4

curious about is,

5

Pennsylvania,

6

as to whether it ends at death,

7

so an explanation to the dearth of cases may be that all

8

clients basically think they're privileged.

9

they're privileged.

20

I don't know,

the California Code and maybe
are maybe a little ambiguous
as I read it through here,

Lawyers think

Everybody thinks they're privileged,

so they don't try to get it.

21

22

of course,

Now,

is there any reason you have for thinking

what I just said is wrong?
MR. KAVANAUGH:

23

I don't think many people have

24

thought about this issue, Justice Breyer,

25

rarely,

and that would be my -50

it comes up so

1

QUESTION:

Well, is the reason that it comes up

2

rarely, because California lawyers, throughout the country

3

lawyers, clients throughout the country go in to a lawyer

4

and they think, I'm safe.

5

so they don't try to get it.

6

is a dearth?

7

MR. KAVANAUGH:

They all think that's the rule,
Is that the reason why there

The reason that there is a

8

dearth is the factual situation rarely comes up, we think,

9

and clients know when they talk to their lawyers, I'm

10

going to have to disclose these facts when I'm called to

11

testify anyway, so that kind of chilling is far greater

12

than anything we propose here.

QUESTION:

Thank you --

Mr. Hamilton, you have 2 minutes remaining.

I thank the Court.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES HAMILTON

18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19

MR. HAMILTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, I want to come

20

back to the work product issue, because I believe Mr.

21

Kavanaugh has misstated the law in that -- in that area.

22

I believe that the Upjohn case, the Hickman case

23

demonstrate that the type of notes that I took are

24

protected by the work product.

25

that embody what the lawyer saw fit to write down enjoy

Upjohn says that notes

special protection, not an ordinary protection, but

special protection.

QUESTION:

This is found at 449 U.S. at 399.
Don't these cases usually come up in

4

the context where somebody would want to use -- where

5

insight into the lawyer's thinking would be useful in

litigation against the lawyer's client?
I mean, is it -- what is the purpose of the work

product privilege?

lawyer's mind works -(Laughter.)

QUESTION:

13

Is it some copyright benefit that the

-- even in future cases that have

nothing to do with this client, or with this litigation?

14

MR. HAMILTON:

The work product privilege is

15

intended to protect the adversary system.

16

to let lawyers work in a certain sphere without

17

interference.

18

QUESTION:

It is intended

Sure, so that your opponent can't see

19

behind your thinking, your strategizing in this particular

20

case.

21

MR. HAMILTON:

22

QUESTION:

That's --

But when the case is all gone, when

23

there's no case left at all, is there something sacrosanct

24

about the way this lawyer's mind was working --

QUESTION:

1

2

-- in a long gone case that has no

future implications?
MR. HAMILTON:

3

I think this Court, in the

4

Grolyer case, has said that the work product privilege

5

extends even after the litigation involved has concluded,

6

but the purpose is to protect the lawyer's thought

7

processes, his methods of working.
QUESTION:

8

This protection --

So it is sort of a copyright.

an intellectual property thing, right?
10

It's

Is that what it

is?
MR. HAMILTON:

11

I have not read any opinion,

12

Justice Scalia, that describes it that way, but there are

13

opinions, including the Moody case that Mr. Kavanaugh

14

cites, that say that the work product privilege belongs to

15

the lawyer as well as to the client, because the cases

16

recognize that the lawyer has an interest to protect and

17

the lawyer can assert that work product privilege even

18

though the client does not.

20

QUESTION:

What is that interest that he has to

protect?

21

MR. HAMILTON:

22

QUESTION:

It is --

When there's -- this litigation is

23

all gone, it's not usable in any other litigation, what is

24

the interest that the lawyer has to protect?

MR. HAMILTON:

It is protecting his thought
