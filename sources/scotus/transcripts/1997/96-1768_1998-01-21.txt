CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. ROBERTS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

In this case, a district judge determined that

12

Mr. Feltner should pay Columbia Pictures $8.8 million in

13

statutory damages for a copyright infringement.

14

arriving at that figure, the judge held a bench trial,

15

after which he made the factual finding that Mr. Feltner's

16

conduct was willful, which increased the amount of damages

17

which could be awarded under the statute.

18

Before

In light of clear historical practice on both

19

sides of the Atlantic prior to 1971, Feltner had a right

20

under the Seventh Amendment to have a jury make that

21

finding and others on which the award was based and

22

determine the amount of damages to be imposed within the

23

statutory limits.

24

Before reaching that constitutional question,

25

however, we need to consider whether the statute may be

construed to afford a jury trial right.

It may be.

First, the first Federal statute providing

2

3

statutory damages in an amount "as to the court shall

4

appear to be just," the

5

damages should be recovered in an action on the case, a

6

prototypical legal action for which a jury would be

7

available.
Statutory damages as to the court shall appear

to be just, the same terminology as employed in the

856

act, were carried forward in successive acts up to the

11

909 act, when the statutory damages provision took its

12

modern form, with no indication that Congress wanted to

delete the jury trial right that was so clearly present in
856 .

statutory provisions.
QUESTION:

2

I take it in the '56 act there was no

3

opportunity to elect a different damage scheme after

4

verdict but before a judgment as there is in the current

5

act.
MR. ROBERTS:

QUESTION:

8

9

That's right.
909 from the

That's one of the
856 act.

So if we followed your reasoning in

this case, as I think your opponents have pointed out, we

10

would have to accept as a consequence that a jury could

11

render its verdict on actual damages, be discharged, go

12

home, and at that point the election could be made to go

3

for statutory damages, and I don't know what happens then.

4

I guess the jury would have to be called back on your

5

theory.
MR. ROBERTS:

6

That's a false problem.

It's

7

never been a problem in the courts that have recognized

8

the jury trial right so far.

9

QUESTION:

21

But it could happen, couldn't it?

MR. ROBERTS:

20

All the judge needs to do --

I don't think so.

All the judge

needs --

22

QUESTION:

Why?

23

MR. ROBERTS:

-- to do is to say to the

24

plaintiff, when the jury comes back, I'm going to enter

25

judgment promptly upon their verdict and therefore they'll

If the plaintiff says I want to elect statutory

2

damages --

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. ROBERTS:

5

Well, if --- the jury would not have been

sent home by that point.
QUESTION:

6

And at that point do you tell the

7

jury -- and this is a problem that I have that runs

8

through the whole case as to what the judge tells the

9

jury.

10

Would it suffice if the jury is told, render such

damages as you consider to be just?
MR. ROBERTS:

11

Well, I think the jury would be

12

instructed according to the factors it's supposed to

13

consider, as juries are, for example, in awarding punitive

14

damages.

15

QUESTION:

I looked in Devitt and Blackmere to

16

see if there were any instructions on statutory damages.

17

There are not.

18

not sure what the judge tells the jury.

19

which way that cuts.

20

The common law measure is there.

MR. ROBERTS:

I'm just

I'm not sure also

Well, the courts have developed

21

guidelines of what is appropriate to consider, whether

22

it's a jury or a judge, in awarding statutory damages, the

23

amount of loss, the value of the copyright, profits --

Those are all set forth in Nimmer and

2

Association and again, I'm not sure which way that works.
It -- on the one hand it seems to me that this

3

is an area where we should develop uniformity and

4

consistency and judges would be helpful.

5

answer to that is that a set of jury instructions

6

developed over the years could do the same thing.

7

MR. ROBERTS:

I suppose your

Well, just as with the case of

8

punitive damages, which is an amount of damages left

9

largely to the discretion of the jury, there have

10

developed instructions as to the factors they should

11

consider, and likewise --

12

13
14

QUESTION:

None of which have been effective.

It's been a serious problem.
But this copyright law is so odd, because under

15

your version, then, a jury would go out and could

16

determine actual damages and come back with a verdict and

17

a figure and then the plaintiff can say, well, I've looked

18

at that, I think I'd do better under statutory damages and

19

can reject that and ask for statutory damages.

20

MR. ROBERTS:

That's true whether a jury or a

21

judge is making that initial determination, so that

22

concern I think doesn't really cut one way or the other on

23

the question of whether --

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. ROBERTS:

Mm-hmm.
-- the jury or the judge reaches

1

that conclusion.

They are unusual in that respect.

QUESTION:

2

Now, in the Tull case from this Court

3

we upheld a scheme under similar Seventh Amendment type

4

concerns and said the judge could nonetheless determine

5

statutory damages.
MR. ROBERTS:

6

Well, the holding in Tull is first

7

of all that that is a legal action, the civil penalty

8

action.

9

the Eighteenth Century, said they were legal, noted that

10

the nature of the remedy, punishment was legal, and then

11

at the very end said, but the actual amount is for the

12

judge.

The court analogized to civil penalty actions in

13

Now, here --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, maybe that would be true here.
If it is true here, then the

16

judgment needs to be reversed because, of course, this

17

judge didn't just determine the amount of damages.

18

made a factual finding of willfulness under the statute.

19

That's something that if this is a legal action --

20

QUESTION:

He

Well, I assume the willfulness aspect

21

could certainly go to a jury if that were the Court's

22

decision, but what would your position be on the balance?

23

MR. ROBERTS:

24

QUESTION:

25

Well --

Because there still is a

discretionary element there, a range of sentences.

MR. ROBERTS:

1

There is a discretionary element

2

and Tull, I think, should be limited to the civil penalty

3

context in which it arose for a number of reasons, first

4

of all because that aspect of the holding was dicta in

5

Tull as a technical matter.
The question of who should determine damages

6

7

wasn't before the Court, because the Court had reversed on

8

liability.

9

question at all.

It may not have been necessary to reach that
That's a technical point.

But the more substantive one is that if you go

10
11

back and look at the briefing in Tull, it was devoted

12

almost exclusively to the question of liability, very

13

little discussion of the question of damages at all and,

14

whatever may be the case with respect to civil penalties

15

prior to 1791, when damages were not fixed, juries decided

16

damages.

17

QUESTION:

And the distinction is that in Tull

18

the Government received the money and that makes it a

19

governmental type of penalty and here the private

20

individual --

21

MR. ROBERTS:

22

QUESTION:

23

Well, the distinction --

The owner of the copyright receives

the money and therefore it's not a penalty.

24

MR. ROBERTS:

25

18th Century practice in England.

The distinction goes back to the

has not fixed the amount of damages in a copyright action,

they should be set by juries under this Court's precedent.

QUESTION:

4

Well, they --

-- identity of the recipient

determine -- is that what your distinction's based on?
MR. ROBERTS:

5

Well, that's part of it, and also

6

in the civil penalty action you have an analogy to

7

criminal sentencing where a judge determines the

8

sentencing.
That analogy doesn't apply in this case because

20

this is a private right -- it's not a public right -- a

21

private action between two parties and the core of the

22

analysis, though, although I think Tull can be limited in

23

that way and its statement is dicta, the core of the

24

analysis shouldn't be extended because it can't be

25

defended.

1

The idea that although Congress fixed the --

2

when Congress fixes the amount of the penalty it can

3

therefore delegate that task to judges ignores the whole

4

purpose of the Seventh Amendment.

5

The Seventh Amendment is to protect against

6

judicial bias and corruption and overreaching and, while

7

that's not implicated when Congress fixes the amount

8

because Congress is doing that, the judge is just applying

9

it, when you give that task to the judge the whole reason

10

for having the Seventh Amendment comes into play, so that

11

logic in Tull, I think, should at the very least not be

12

extended any further.

QUESTION:

Is there any evidence who set the --

MR. ROBERTS:

QUESTION:

Yes.

If there was an argument about how

8

many sheets there were, did the jury decide it or the

9

judge, do we know?

20
21

22

MR. ROBERTS:

The jury, cert jury.

We've cited

cases to that effect I believe on page 43 of our brief.
QUESTION:

But Mr. Roberts, in this case on that

very point that was the one piece of it that I noticed --

generally, it seems to me that how many infringements was

2

ruled on as a matter of law.

3

even before his bench trial?

Didn't the judge rule on it

4

MR. ROBERTS:

It's very confusing.

He did not.

5

At the start of the bench trial he said that the

6

issues remaining for trial were how many infringements

7

were involved and were they willful, and what should the

8

damages be, so at the very outset at least, he thought

9

that was an issue for trial.
Later on, he also said he wanted to hear about

10
11

how many infringements were involved.

12

he was ruling on it as a matter of law.
QUESTION:

13

Later on, he said

But aren't those questions -- whether

14

question.

1

There are factual issues involved in that and

3

should have happened is that the jury should have been

4

able to determine those facts based on proper instructions

7

QUESTION:

Do you say the same thing about the

two stations, whether they were --

8

MR. ROBERTS:

9

QUESTION:

10

Yes.

-- separate entities?

MR. ROBERTS:

It's not just a question of

11

whether they were separate entities, but whether they were

12

jointly and severally responsible for the infringement,

13

because the statute allows only one award of statutory

14

damage for all individual or joint and several

15

infringements of each work.

16

18

QUESTION:

So you say if this judge ruled on

those two questions as a matter of law that he was wrong.
MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

That -- those should have

19

been submitted to the jury and, as I say, there's some

20

confusion as to what he did.

QUESTION:

You're not saying that in principle

they could never be ruled on as a matter of law.

On summary judgment.

But you don't think that this

question, how many, could be summary judgment, too, but

14

you say it wasn't in this case.

15

MR. ROBERTS:

I think it was not in this case.

16

I do think it's difficult to tell when you have the judge

17

acting both as fact-finder and as ruler of law when he's

18

saying based on these facts I'm making this decision, or

19

I'm making this decision as a matter of law and it's also

difficult, when that same judge has made a ruling on

1

of infringements, as the judge indicated was an issue

2

available for trial at the outset.

3

And the court of appeals seemed to think that

4

that was decided at least as a mixed question.

It

5

referred to the judge's findings and whether or not they

6

were erroneous,

rather than treating it as a legal ruling.

7

Now, the first step in this Court's

8

constitutional approach is to find an analogue to this

9

action in 18th Century practice and ask whether that's

10

legal or equitable.

11

The analogue to modern actions for statutory

12

damages for copyright infringement is the 18th Century

13

action for statutory damages for copyright infringement

14

under the Statute of Anne, under the first Federal

15

copyright statute passed 1 year before the Seventh

16

Amendment by the same Congress that passed the Seventh

17

Amendment, and those statutes provided for recovery of

18

amounts and specified that they should be recovered in an

19

action at law.

That's right, that ruling on the

reasons you have this relief doesn't make it equitable.

If you sue for liquidated damages in a contract

7

it's still a legal action for which a jury is required.

That's the reason you had the fixed penalties in the

Statute of Anne, because actual damages were difficult to

calculate and yet the respondent agrees that that was a

legal action to recover those damages.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

alternative to actual damages to provide some recompense

not provide an adequate remedy.

Statutory damages were later amended and
expanded in

where legal damages are inadequate is quintessentially an

equitable remedy.

9

court and an appeal to the court's sense of justice based

a remedy that is both just and consistent with the goals

of the Copyright Act.

QUESTION:

Did the Tull footnote 7 in effect say

that's not a consideration that should influence --

5

MR. TASHMAN:

No, it didn't.

I think the Tull

6

footnote 7 said that the Government's argument regarding

7

discretion was in a sense trumped by the fact that what we

8

were dealing with in Tull were punitive damages, or a

9

punitive statute and that was the more important

20

consideration in Tull and the Court correctly stated in

21

Tull that punitive damages and penalties were the

22

exclusive province of the courts of law and not the courts

23

of equity.

4

holder, given the inadequacy of the legal remedy of actual

5

6

The primary purpose of statutory damages

QUESTION:

Mr. Tashman, if I follow your

7

argument correctly, then if a copyright holder comes in at

8

the outset and says, I want the court to find that there

9

has been an infringement and I want statutory damages, I

10

don't want any other kind of damages, could such a

11

plaintiff then avoid having a jury trial on the question

12

of infringement?

13

On your theory, I take it yes.

MR. TASHMAN:

Absolutely.

I would characterize

14

statutory damages as an equitable action and an equitable

15

proceeding, just like an action for an injunction and, as

16

in an action in an injunction, all the issues, including

17

the issue of infringement, would be for the court and in a

18

similar fashion, if only statutory damages were sought,

19

which is quite possible under the current act, in the 1976

20

act, then all of the issues, including infringement, would

21

go to the court.

22

Now, in this case statutory damages were not

23

elected until after the court granted summary judgment

24

both on copyright liability and also the number of

25

infringements which were involved.

There seems to be a debate about

what -- the number of infringements, whether that was, in

fact, a summary judgment --

MR. TASHMAN:

Oh, there's no question about it.

5

The only question that I think is subject to some debate,

and even that is really not subject to serious debate, is

not the number of broadcasts, because that was either

have to disagree with Your Honor on two counts.

to the practice at common law, under the colonial statutes

10

11

First, as

on the 1790 act first.
The jury played no role whatsoever in

12

determining the amount of damages.

13

jury determined was whether or not there was an

14

infringement and the number of copies in the possession of

15

the infringer and, once those two facts had been

determined, damages were calculated arithmetically by

17

multiplying the number of works in possession by the

So if we look at the state of the world just

Unlike the assessment of statutory

14

damages within a range, which involves a huge amount of

15

discretion and this discretion is really entirely

16

different from the discretion that a jury uses in trying

17

to ascertain the appropriate amount of actual damages.

QUESTION:

How about punitive damages?

has extraordinary discretion there.
MR. TASHMAN:

Well, it certainly has more

21

discretion than it does in determining actual damages, but

22

for example, the jury cannot, and it would be error for

23

the jury to take into account the conduct of the attorneys

24

and the conduct of the litigants in bringing the

litigation and how they conducted the litigation and yet

MR. TASHMAN:

1

No, no, in statutory damages

courts have used the cooperation or lack of cooperation

3

and the manner in which counsel have conducted themselves

Could

8

you explain to me very briefly, as -- perhaps I haven't a

clear view of Tull, but Tull was a case that I thought

10

gave you support and, as I understood the case, it would

11

have said that the action for damages, a penalty in that

12

case, is, in fact, legal and therefore the plaintiff or a

13

defendant, there would be a right to a jury trial, but

14

then it talked about the assessment of the amount of the

15

penalty and, as far as the assessment of the amount of the

16

penalty was concerned there was no Seventh Amendment

17

right.

18

Now, if that's -- if I'm reading it correctly,

19

then in this case it would suggest that even if -- I take

20

it you'd have to say and even if.

21

legal and therefore there is a right to a jury trial to

22

determine whether or not statutory damages is due, there

is under Tull nonetheless no jury trial right as to the

amount of the damages.

At that point, is that the end of the

matter, or are you saying that indeed, even if that's so,

the judge the power to assess the amount of the penalty?

19

MR. TASHMAN:

Well, we are arguing that this is

equitable, but in the event that the court rejects that

21

and finds that it is legal, we are clearly arguing that,

22

based upon Tull and based upon the second prong of the

test in the Court's recent decision in Markman, that it

would be entirely appropriate for the Court to assess the

willfulness, would be the province of the court, and I

2

think that's especially significant in this case.
There is no requirement under the Copyright

3
4

Act -- and the petitioners make this argument and I think

5

it's clearly incorrect, that there is no mandatory

6

requirement for a finding of willfulness or a finding of

7

innocence.

8

9

The statute gives the court the absolute
discretion to award damages between $500 and $20,000

10

without any finding whatsoever as to willfulness or

11

innocence and in this case the court found that $20,000

12

was the appropriate award, and that is an award which does

13

not require any finding of willfulness or innocence.

14

15
16

Only if the court wants to go above the $20,000
is there a requirement that the court find willfulness.
QUESTION:

But didn't the court find willfulness

17

here as kind of a part of his explanation of why he picked

18

20 rather than $500?

MR. TASHMAN:

Well, we certainly know that the

court did find willfulness.

22

without a finding of willfulness, we really don't know.

a question that goes to the

point of whether Tull helps you even on damages alone.

One reason Mr. Roberts suggested that Tull might

not help you on that is that in Tull there was no -- there

18

was no 18th Century analogue and here he says there is

and, going to that point, my question is this.

20

Granted that in the early actions which were, I

21

guess, brought in this country either for debt or in an

22

action on the case for damages which were, as you point

23

out, just mathematically calculated -- you find the number

24

of sheets, you multiply it times a penny or what-not, and

that's your verdict -- nonetheless, despite the rather

1

mechanistic way that damages would be calculated in those

2

cases, is there authority that indicates that in those

3

early cases the juries were returning verdicts simply of

4

so many sheets plus infringement, as distinct from a

5

verdict for money damages?

6

In other words, were the juries coming back with

7

general verdicts, or were they simply coming back with the

8

basis for calculating a verdict which the judge then did?

9

Do we know?

10
11

In other words, I want to know what the 18th

Century analogue is here in practice.
MR. TASHMAN:

I -- that's not a question that I

12

have an answer to, although I would argue that, regardless

13

of whether or not the juries specified an amount in the

14

award or whether they just specified the number of copies

15

in the possession of the defendant, that this statute and

16

the colonial statute are entirely inadequate analogues to

17

statutory damages, because the key and the essence of

18

statutory damages is finding an alternate way to

19

recompense the plaintiff outside of the standard rules of

20

proof and outside of the standard measure of damages and

21

outside of the standard rules of evidence.

22

And what we have in the 18th Century are

classic, rigid, legal causes of action either in debt,

have been in the pocket in the first place.
We're talking about a statutory damage remedy

2

3

here with an outer limit in a willfulness case that

4

exceeds anything that was known to 18th Century equity, I

5

would suppose.
MR. TASHMAN:

6

Well, I'm not sure that's true if

7

you factor in inflation, but regardless of that, if you're

8

talking about an injunction to enjoin another copyrighted

work -- for example, today one motion picture believes

10

another motion picture is infringing and if you want to

talk about leverage, the leverage and the risk is not so

much the damages as enjoining the infringing work, which

13

may have cost hundreds of millions of dollars, before that

work is distributed based upon copyright infringement.
So it's quite possible that when you're dealing

is just as great, if not greater, than when you're dealing

I suspect a jury would have awarded more

First, where statutory damages were elected after

a jury came down with a verdict for actual damages and

then you'd have to send back that jury and the jury,

having deliberated and figured out that X dollars was the

tell them, no, no, no, unring the bell, come up with

thing to ask a jury to do, kind of to unring the bell,

especially when you don't give them any guidelines to tell

Well, I hope you wouldn't rule

based upon that.

If they have to try the case over.

No, I understand that.
But it is puzzling to me as to why, because of

16
17

the position filed by the amici, why this class of

18

plaintiffs is afraid of -- seems to disapprove of juries

19

whereas the plaintiff generally would seem to prefer

20

juries.

suggests why that should develop?

Is there anything about copyright law that

Well, I think we're dealing with

intangible rights.

We're dealing with rights that are

24

inherently difficult to value.

25

which are not consumed.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.

14

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

15

MR. ROBERTS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

16

Justice Souter, the answer to your question is

17

juries at common law returned general verdicts for an

18

amount.

19

citations are collected at page 43 of our brief.

20

22

They didn't say 50 sheets, go do the math.

QUESTION:

They returned general verdicts where

there was a statutory specified amount for each sheet?
MR. ROBERTS:

Sure.

23

but they did the calculation.

24

QUESTION:

25

The

Now, it's a calculation,

But I mean, it wasn't a great mystery

what the calculation ought to be.

MR. ROBERTS:

No.

No, at least not under those

2

where the amount was fixed.

It was under the statutes in

3

New Hampshire and Massachusetts and Rhode Island.

4

Justice Kennedy, a better citation than the one

5

I gave you is on page 35 of our brief, the Colburn case,

6

saying the court in equity doesn't award anything beyond

7

the accounting, so damages beyond restitution would not be

8

allowed.

9

It's important to recognize that the willfulness

10

determination here was critical to the judgment.

11

district court noted the range for willful infringements

12

before imposing his award.

13

should award a higher award.

14

infringement and that's less than half the amount you can

15

award, what they said and, of course, the court of appeals

16

in upholding the amount emphasized that the infringements

17

were willful and the $20,000 figure was well within the

18

statutory range.

Now,

QUESTION:

So we'd have to overrule Tull,

in

your view.

7

MR. ROBERTS:

No.

I think Tull can be confined

8

to the civil penalty context in which it arose and the

9

particular history in which it arose.

In other words, the

10

historical fact about civil penalties as opposed to

11

damages.

12

But we know that damages were set by the jury

13

when they were not fixed, regardless of the case with

respect to civil penalties.
