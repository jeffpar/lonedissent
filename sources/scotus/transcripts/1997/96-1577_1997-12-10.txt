ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

18

How do they

MR. ROBERTS:

Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In 1971 Congress settled Native Alaskan land

19

claims by passing the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.

20

That act revoked all reservations in Alaska save one, and

21

extinguished all claims based on aboriginal title.

22

In exchange, it conveyed to State-chartered

23

corporations owned by individual Native shareholders $1

24

billion and 44 million acres of land in fee simple, land

25

which because a freely alienable asset of the corporations

to do with as they see fit.
The Ninth Circuit nonetheless held that the

2

3

settlement lands at issue in this case were Indian

4

country, a jurisdictional concept epitomized by the

5

reservation and characterized by land held in trust or

6

otherwise controlled by the Federal Government.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, why do you suppose

8

Congress didn't just mention somewhere in this settlement

9

act section 1151's dependent Indian community notion?

10

mean, it would have been so easy --

11

MR. ROBERTS:

QUESTION:

Well, it's often the case that --

-- to include a little phrase there

13

somewhere about that.

14

happen?

15

I

Why do you think that didn't

MR. ROBERTS:

I think because Congress in 1971

16

had no reason to suppose that there was any such Indian

17

country in Alaska.

18

decision of Alaskan courts that had looked at the

19

question, and at the time, yes, there were a handful of

20

reservations that were --

That had been the nearly uniform

21

QUESTION:

There were some reservations.

22

MR. ROBERTS:

There were reservations, and they

23

were revoked, so to the extent there was Indian country

24

that they would be aware of, they took action very

25

expressly to extinguish it.

1

QUESTION:

But most of the land that was

2

conveyed was not Indian country under the then-prevailing

3

jurisprudence.

4

MR. ROBERTS:

That's correct and, in fact, it

5

was not Indian country under the accepted concept as it

6

had developed in the lower 48.

7

QUESTION:

I have some -- I have another just

8

kind of basic question here that you can help me with.

9

What is sought here by the Venetie Village is the ability

10

to levy a certain kind of tax, in this instance on

11

construction of a school building.

12

Now, can the village be incorporated, if you

13

will, as a municipality under Alaska law so that the

14

village would have all the powers of any incorporated

15

municipality in Alaska?

16

MR. ROBERTS:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. ROBERTS:

QUESTION:

20

MR. ROBERTS:

21

QUESTION:

22

23

Yes, and in fact many --

Has it done so, to your knowledge?
Venetie has not done so.

But it could.
It could, yes.

Now, if it did that, could it impose

taxes like any other municipality in Alaska?
MR. ROBERTS:

It would have the same authority,

24

there is, in fact, a restriction in the Alaska

25

constitution that says the only local entities who may tax

are cities and boroughs.

2

country determination is so important, because in the

3

absence of Indian country that constitutional provision

4

would apply, and in --

It would have the same taxing

powers as other villages.

MR. ROBERTS:

As other municipalities.
Other municipalities.

Yes.
I think there are restrictions on

23

the extent to which they can tax, but their powers would

24

be the same.

Now --

QUESTION:

Can you give us an example of what

1

other comparable population villages can do, non-Indian

2

villages, in the way of taxing power, because it would be

3

kind of an academic exercise to bring this case all the

4

way here if their claim to this tax didn't depend on their

5

sovereignty claim, unlike other cities or villages.
MR. ROBERTS:

6

7

tax does depend on their sovereignty.
Now, of course, the question that was decided

8

9

Well, we think their authority to

below, and the question on which this Court granted

10

certiorari, was not directly the validity or nonvalidity

11

of the tax.

12

interlocutory posture.

13

which is very pertinent in assessing whether or not the

14

tax is valid.

15

litigated throughout, and the question that was presented.

16

It was -- the case is here in an
It's the ruling on Indian country,

That was the way the case has been

QUESTION:

But it's useful to know, and I

17

certainly would like to know what that means.

18

Indian country, apparently, if it's proper, would allow

19

this tax, so what else is gained by having the label,

20

Indian country?
MR. ROBERTS:

21

The label,

Oh, it has broad jurisdictional

22

significance.

If land is Indian country, we start with

23

the presumption that tribal and Federal jurisdiction

24

controls, and that State jurisdiction is generally

25

displaced.

If land is not Indian country, State

1

jurisdiction applies as it does in other areas, so it has

2

significance not only with respect to taxes but to

3

environmental regulation, hunting and fishing, gaming

4

regulation, health and safety regulation, a broad range of

5

day-to-day regulation.

6

is in charge?

7

It answers the basic question, who

If it's Indian country, characterized throughout

8

the country by the reservation, you know that the tribal

9

government has sovereign authority and the Federal

10

Government also has sovereign authority.

11

Indian country, State law applies as it does generally

12

throughout.

3

QUESTION:

If it's not

At least some of the friends of the

4

court told us not to worry because in fact Alaska, even if

5

this village is Indian country, can regulate hunting and

6

fishing, and that actually there would not be these large

7

consequences.

8
9

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, I think that's -- certainly

on a case-by-case basis whether a particular regulation

20

can be applied in Indian country or not is a determination

21

that would have to be made on the particular facts, but if

22

you take a case like New Mexico v. the Mescalero Tribe,

23

there the Court held that State gaming laws did not apply

24

in that Indian country.

25

QUESTION:

Gaming.

You mean game and fish laws.

MR. ROBERTS:

2

QUESTION:

3
4

Yes.

Yes, hunting --

Now we talk about gaming as referring

to gambling.
MR. ROBERTS:

I appreciate that. Yes, I --

5

hunting and fishing, but, of course, the same with respect

6

to gambling, and the reason you have that is because the

7

normal State rules do not apply in Indian country.

8

9

QUESTION:

Might gaming be a big matter that's

up for grabs here?

10

MR. ROBERTS:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. ROBERTS:

Hunting and fishing --

Gaming in Justice O'Connor's sense.
Hunting and fishing is.

Gaming,

13

it could be, although it doesn't look like an attractive

14

location for a big casino.

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. ROBERTS:

But other basic elements like

17

environmental regulation, what type of development can

18

take place, the broad question of State regulation, a

19

determination of whether it's Indian country establishes

20

who, at least as an initial matter, is in charge.

21

QUESTION:

But it is true, isn't it, that no

22

matter -- if we mix it up and get it all wrong, Congress

23

can always straighten it all out, either way.

24
25

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, yes.

Congress has plenary

authority over Indian country, and we think when it

exercised authority in ANCSA to settle aboriginal claims,

2

it took a course of action fundamentally inconsistent with

3

Indian country.

4

The reservation is the prototypical --

QUESTION:

Well, you say they have plenary power

5

over Indian country.

6

isn't Indian country, what power does Congress have then?

7

Suppose this Court were to say it

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, then it has the power it has

8

over other lands, because the key fact of ANCSA is that

9

these settlement lands were given away free and clear, in

10

fee simple.

They were made freely alienable property of

11

the corporations to which they were given.

12

Government did not retain control.

The Federal

That is the defining

3

characteristic that makes it clear that this is not Indian

4

country.

5

This is not -- the test that this Court has

6

articulated is that Indian country is land set apart for

7

the use of the Indians as such, under the superintendence

8

of the Federal Government.

9

for anyone's use.

These lands were not set aside

They were given -- we're done with it,

20

free and clear.

21

see fit, and have.

22

sold the lands, developed it in different ways.

23

The corporations can do with them as they

QUESTION:

They've transferred the lands, they've

But of course the statute did settle

24

a huge dispute over aboriginal title, didn't it?

25

an end to that whole controversy of who owned the lands.

It put

1

MR. ROBERTS:

2

QUESTION:

Yes, and --

So you can make sense out of the

3

statute even if you don't think it went quite as far as

4

you think it did.

5

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, we think that it -- in

6

giving the lands away free and clear Congress intended

7

somehow to also set them aside --

8

9

QUESTION:

Well, they gave them away in exchange

for a total surrender of any aboriginal claims.

10

MR. ROBERTS:

11

QUESTION:

12

13

Yes.

So it's not exactly a -- totally --

you know, not a total gift.
MR. ROBERTS:

Oh, no, it wasn't a -- it wasn't a

14

gift at all, but my point was they retained no control

15

over the land, and in every case in which this Court has

16

found Indian country the lands have either been within the

17

boundaries of a reservation, or otherwise subject to

18

Federal control.

19

This would be the first instance in which the

20

Court has found Indian country where the Federal

21

Government retained no control, and if you think about it,

22

the concept of Indian country is inconsistent with the

23

relinquishment of control, under the superintendence of

24

the Federal Government, how --

QUESTION:

If I could just ask you right there,

1

it's your view, I take it, that if you have an area of

2

land that is an absolutely typical reservation, absolutely

3

typical in every way, but somebody used the word colony

4

instead of the word reservation, then it would fall within

5

(b) and not (a).

It would fall within --

6

MR. ROBERTS:

7

QUESTION:

That, of course, is McGowan.

Yes, all right, so that's precise.

8

And then you look at 618(a), which revokes the

9

reservation.

10

MR. ROBERTS:

11

QUESTION:

Yes.

And you say, although they didn't use

12

the word, dependent community, they must have intended to

13

revoke that, took.

14
15

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, yes, but not simply because

they revoked the reservations but because, for example,

16

QUESTION:

For that and other reasons.

17

MR. ROBERTS:

18

QUESTION:

Other reasons.

All right.

But now, whatever those

19

other reasons are, that and other reasons, however strong

20

they get you to your conclusion in (a), why don't they

21

force the opposite conclusion because of (b), where a

22

reservation goes back, revokes all the privileges it might

23

have gotten under this act, gives the land back to the

24

tribe, and behaves in respect to the tribe exactly as it

25

behaved before the act, with land in trust?

MR. ROBERTS:

You're referring to the

reconveyance --

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. ROBERTS:

5

QUESTION:

Yes, they reconvey.
The reconveyance of the land --

What they do is they say, okay, what

6

we're going to do is, we're going to give up everything we

7

have under this act, we're going to take the land just as

8

it was, call it a reservation, even, behave exactly the

9

same way in respect to it, take it in, funnel it back, and

10

now what we have after these two events is just what we

11

had before.

12

MR. ROBERTS:

The reason is that the decision to

13

create Indian country is up to Congress.

14

in this case, to the two ANCSA corporations that received

15

the land under --

It's not up, as

MR. ROBERTS:

No, and that's --

The corporation did.
That's the critical point.

Yes.
And it is also the clearest

evidence that the Federal Government had relinquished its

control and had no control over the decision of the ANCSA

12

corporations that received the lands that used to be the

Venetie Reservation.

to turn it back, 6 years later, to the tribal government.

What they did --

-- to accept it in trust for the

QUESTION:

They actually --

So isn't the really crucial point

7

that there is no control?

8

the meaning of the formula that we used that you've been

quoting, the validly-set-aside-subject-to-

I mean, I suppose that within

superintendence, and so on, that I suppose if the statute

11

had said, and if any of this land is reconveyed by these

12

corporations to the tribes that originally owned them,

13

they will be subject to the same superintendence which we

14

have traditionally been able to exercise.

15

MR. ROBERTS:

16

QUESTION:

I suppose --

Well, they could --

-- there would be a fair argument

17

then to say, okay, it has reverted to Indian country

18

status, but that's not the case here.

19

MR. ROBERTS:

It's not the case.

The Government

20

doesn't retain control, and the Government didn't

21

participate in the process.

22

by the district court and also by the Department of

23

Interior in its opinion on this subject, that this was a

24

unilateral act of the corporations not approved and not

25

joined in in any way by the Government.

This was a particular finding

It doesn't

reestablish Federal control that existed when the

There are other provisions

Mr. Roberts, would you just explain

12

to me what benefit a tribe would have, then, from making

13

the 1618(b) election, where they don't get any money, and

14

they just -- just give us the reservation that we had

15

before?

16

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, they get a lot more land.

17

There are two ways that Venetie could have elected to

18

receive benefits under the act the way most other villages

19

did, which gives -- has a formula based on population that

20

says you get so many acres or, under 1618(b), they could

21

take title to the former reservation and get the 1.8

22

million acres, and they get both the surface and the

23

subsurface.

24
25

If they'd elected the other option they would
have title just to the surface, and the regional

Corporation under ANCSA would have title to the

subsurface, so they got a great deal more by pursuing that

option and, as was explained by the Department of the

MS. KENDALL:

1

Yes, Justice Scalia.

That

particular provision speaks to the creation of a wardship,

3

but it doesn't speak to the ongoing relationship that

4

existed, and it is true that Congress, through that

I disagree.

It's quite in -- it seems to me

6

MS. KENDALL:

Your Honor, section 16 -- I mean,

7

1151(b), the category that covers the Indian communities,

8

that particular category does not turn on lands being in

9

Federal ownership.

It turns on a community that is under

10

the protection and guardianship of the Federal Government,

11

and that's what we have today with respect to Venetie.

12

QUESTION:

Dependency.

Dependency to the

confirmed by the Congress in the 1994 federally recognized

Tribal List Act, where Congress expressly reaffirmed its

20

ongoing relationship to all federally recognized tribes,

21

including Venetie, and that fact fundamentally undermines

22

all of petitioner's arguments, because from that flows two

important points, the first that the continuing

Kennedy, that a tribe can unilaterally create Indian

country, but if a -- the Federal Government treats with

and recognizes and deals with a particular Indian

2

your position, if I am correct that these should be read

3

in the light of that traditional definition, is that even

4

conceding that there may have been some protection

5

provided on a continuing basis, the fact that the land was

so readily alienable, unconditionally alienable, seems to

me to be inconsistent with the superintendence requirement

which I am assuming is part of (b) .
Am I right that it is inconsistent with the

MS. KENDALL:

No.

If I can take the (b)

14

question first, what you refer to, a reference to land

superintendence is that the Federal Government retains its

plenary authority to enact protective legislation over

That's superintendence, and that is present

when and if to alienate their lands, but until that land

Afterward, when the corporations had unilaterally

reconveyed it to the tribe, the Federal Government had no

ownership and no control, a significant change.

4

Second, when the reservation was set up, it was

5

set up by the Federal Government, set apart for the use of

the Indians under Federal superintendence.

reconveying to the tribe was not an action of the federal

Government.

The issue is

It's also --

Could the Federal Government come

MR. ROBERTS:

10

No, I don't think so, Your Honor,

because that would be inconsistent with ANCSA, which gave
to them jurisdiction and control over the land.
The State could, because it is land subject to

State jurisdiction, like everyone else's land.
