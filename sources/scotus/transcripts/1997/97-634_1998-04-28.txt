ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL A. TUFANO

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. TUFANO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Applying the Americans With Disabilities Act to

12

State prisoners goes against the intent of Congress and

13

violates the Constitution.

14

alter the Federal-State balance of power without first

15

giving States notice and then opportunity to be heard, and

16

it ignores this Court's clear mandate that State prison

17

administrators who have difficult and dangerous jobs be

18

given great deference.

It also allows Congress to

19

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. --

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Tufano, did you make your

21
22

constitutional argument in the courts below?
MR. TUFANO:

Your Honor, we did make

23

constitutional arguments in that we have always argued in

24

this case as a matter of statutory construction,

25

federalism issues, and the issue of the clear statement

1

rule, and as a matter of statutory construction we believe

2

that the Court is to be guided by possible serious and

3

grave constitutional questions which could arise from an

4

interpretation of the Americans With Disabilities Act as

5

applying to prisoners.

6

QUESTION:

Did you make that argument below,

7

that the statute should be construed a particular way

8

because to construe it another way would get into

9

constitutional difficulties?

10

MR. TUFANO:

We did not, Your Honor.

We argued

11

below, as we have always, the issues of federalism and the

12

same arguments that we've raised below regarding

13

federalism go to the arguments which we have made as a

14

matter of statutory construction regarding the Fourteenth

15

Amendment and the Commerce Clause as well.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Tufano, the language of the

17

statute says that public entity means any State or local

18

government, any department, agency, district or other

19

instrumentality of a State or States or local government.

20

That's very broad language, is it not?

21

MR. TUFANO:

22

QUESTION:

Yes, it is, Your Honor.
Now, what about the application of

23

the ADA -- disabilities act -- to employees of prisons?

24

Does it apply there?

25

MR. TUFANO:

Yes, it does, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

MR. TUFANO:

3

6

How about to visitors at prisons?
We would take the position that it

does apply to visitors, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well then, what, in the language that

I read, gets you off the hook for prisoners?
MR. TUFANO:

We don't dispute the fact that the

7

Department of Corrections is a public entity within the

8

meaning of the ADA and in title II, but there is a

9

difference between the Department of Corrections being

10

considered a public entity and whether a prison is a

11

public entity or a program, activity, or service.

12

When the Department of Corrections wears its --

13

QUESTION:

Well, a prison might not itself be a

14

program, but it might have within the prison context a

15

program or activity.

16

the particular program, the boot camp, is a sort of

17

program or activity of the prison.

18

MR. TUFANO:

In this very case it's alleged that

We believe, Your Honor, that

19

program, activity, and service have different meanings in

20

the context of a prison, that it is not the -- it was not

21

the intent of Congress to cover something like prisoners,

22

that prisoners are not part of the public, and that --

23

QUESTION:

I can understand an argument that in

24

complying with the statute and the regulations, that the

25

prison only has to make reasonable modifications based on

the circumstances.
Now, surely the circumstance that it's a prison

3

and there are great security concerns would affect that

4

determination, would it not?

5

MR. TUFANO:

It would affect it, Your Honor, but

6

again, you have to look at the fact that Congress'

7

findings in enacting the ADA talked about employment,

8

housing, voting, medical services, and it talked about

9

access to public services, and it talked about people

10

having -- being able to live independently, and they

11

talked about living in a free society, and the fact that

12

they based their findings in large part on the U.S.

13

Commission on Civil Rights Report of 1983, which they

14

lifted the conclusions almost verbatim, except for one, on

15

involuntary sterilization, and they chose a couple of more

16

which were not in the conclusions --

20
21

QUESTION:

Mr. Tufano, which Civil Rights Act

did you say?
MR. TUFANO:

The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights

Report of 1983, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

And that is of the same genre,

I

22

believe, as title VI, which, as you know, covers race

23

discrimination, and I think the language is almost

24

identical, so would you say, then, on your reasoning about

25

prisoners, that title VI would not apply either to

prisoners?
MR. TUFANO:

That's correct, Your Honor.

The

3

Congress specifically chose two or three findings, or list

4

of areas in the appendix to this report which did not

5

discuss them as areas where discriminatory practices

6

occur, and they specifically left behind the criminal

7

justice system, where --

QUESTION:

Who is they?

approved by the whole Congress?
10

MR. TUFANO:

Was this report
Who is it a report of?

It was a report of the U.S.

11

Commission on Civil Rights, and it was, I believe,

12

introduced into both committees of Congress, Your Honor.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

And you want to attribute that to the

whole Congress?
MR. TUFANO:

Well, Justice O'Connor's question

16

about public entity, and whether a prison is a program,

17

statutory construction, as this Court has held, is a

18

holistic endeavor, and you look not only at individual

1

sentences, but you also look at the whole purpose of the

20

law, and the purpose of the ADA was to provide for the

21

assimilation in free society of American citizens in

22

employment - -

23

QUESTION:

Well, what about the background of

24

the Rehabilitation Act, which has been on the books since

25

the seventies, and as I understand it, the ADA is modeled

1

precisely on that, and there is some 20 years of

2

Department of Justice regulations saying that prisons are

3

covered.

4

MR. TUFANO:

In -- that's correct, Your Honor.

5

In -- the Rehab Act regulations which were promulgated by

6

the Justice Department referred to prisons, and in 1

7

when Congress enacted the ADA, and the States were to

8

supposed to have been given a clear statement that the

0,

historic sovereign function of State prison management was
10

about to be entered into by the Congress, the -- what

11

Congress was aware of at best was Rehabilitation Act

12

regulations promulgated by the agency, nothing in the act,

13

and there were -- there was a Circuit Court decision and

14

two district court decisions, and in the ADA, it refers

15

back to parts of the Rehab Act regulations, part 3

16

part 41.

17

and

Part 41 doesn't say anything about prisons, and

18

the respondent and the Federal Government argue that the

1

States were to know that in part 42 there is mention about

20

prisons.

21

Federal prisons very much into the fine print, and that's

22

what's wrong with the ADA.

23

Part 3

talks about the Justice Department and

The ADA -- the argument of the respondent in the

24

Federal Government as to what the clear statement was in

25

the ADA is to read the fine print.

The problem is that

the fine print is in another set of regulations under a

2

different law, and it does not appear in the four corners

3

of the document, and it's our position that --

4

QUESTION:

What does appear in the four corners

5

of the document that enables you to exclude prisons?

6

language do you rely upon that excludes -- it doesn't

7

really exclude prisons entirely, just excludes those

8

programs in prisons that relate to prisoners?

9

MR. TUFANO:

What

You start with the findings, Your

10

Honor, by Congress, in the findings section of the ADA,

11

where they talk about the different areas where they have

12

found problems with discrimination and the -- they don't

13

talk about the criminal --

14

QUESTION:

So any area that is not mentioned in

15

the finding is not covered by the text of the act, even

16

though the words otherwise would cover it.

principle you want us to apply?

18

MR. TUFANO:

19

Is that the

Well, that's part of the principle

I'd want you to apply.
The other part would to be -- to look at the

20

21

meanings of the words in the statute regarding a qualified

22

individual who meets the essential eligibility

23

requirement.

It starts out, some 43 million Americans have one or more

2

physical or mental disability.

3

million not counting prisoners?

4

MR. TUFANO:

Are you saying that's 43

Yes, I am, Your Honor, because if

5

you look below that they talk about discrimination in such

areas as employment, housing, public accommodations,

education, transportation, communication, and recreation.

QUESTION:

Such areas as.

Institutionalization is there, but

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. TUFANO:

Yes.
-- we believe that the meaning of

18

institutionalization, which again these areas were lifted,

19

that that sentence in 12101(a)(3) is almost verbatim

20

language from the U.S. Commission Report, where

21

institutionalization is not discussed in the criminal

22

justice context.

23

QUESTION:

Well, but just staying within the

24

four corners of the document is what we started to do.

would have thought institutionalization includes being

institutionalized in a prison or a mental institution or

2

whatever kind of institution, just without knowing the

3

background of your argument.

4

MR. TUFANO:

I understand, Your Honor, but

5

again, if you look at the language in the ADA which talks

6

about qualified individuals who meet essential eligibility

7

requirements -- and it's in the context of title II, which

8

is about public services, and I don't think that you can

9

reasonably conclude that meeting the eligibility

10

requirements to receive food stamps, or to get into a

11

library or a museum, is the same as meeting the

12

eligibility requirements to get into prison.

13

QUESTION:

It isn't a matter of getting into

14

prison, but once you're in prison, the eligibility

15

requirements to use the prison exercise facilities, right?

16

I guess not everybody's allowed to use them.

17

the guards can't use them.

18

requirements for various activities in the prison?

19

MR. TUFANO:

I suppose

Aren't there eligibility

There are eligibility requirements

20

within a prison, but the difference is that public

21

services are provided to the public for their benefit, and

22

not all of the programs and activities and services of a

23

prison are primarily for the benefit of the prisoner.

24
25

QUESTION:

Okay, but you don't -- the word

The word public is not defined anywhere so as to

2

say it means free people rather than incarcerated people,

3

so you -- am I correct?

MR. TUFANO:

position, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

6

That's correct that that's our

Well then, public apparently means, I

assume from the act, any person in relation to the

the term?

Wouldn't that be the normal significance of

If Government is being bound, public is that

10
11

which is not Government, so public I presume would include

12

prisoners.
MR. TUFANO:

13

Well, the public in the context of

14

the ADA, which talks about assimilation of people

15

immediately into free society, is very different from what

16

happens with prisoners, where we take them out of society.

17

MR. TUFANO:

anywhere, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

21

It is very different, but is it

The word public is not defined

You said not all prison programs are

22

for the benefit of the prisoner, but the very one we have

23

before us surely is, this boot camp that allows a prisoner

24

to save many, many months of incarceration, isn't that

25

right?

Wouldn't you call that for the benefit of the

MR. TUFANO:

Certainly there's a incidental

3

benefit for the prisoner, but if you look at the Boot Camp

4

Act, the General Assembly in Pennsylvania was seeking to

5

deal with the problem of overcrowding in prison, and to

6

deal with the problems of riots in prison, and that was

the purpose of the statute.

curtailed many of their rights, unlike somebody who is in

about, the different areas that there, had problems with,

2

knowing that for 25 years and more this Court has

3

consistently talked about the problems unique to prison

management and have not applied the same constitutional

analysis to prisoners, so I believe that when you look at

6

the way prisoners are treated in the eyes of the

7

Constitution, if you look at the -QUESTION:

8

9

Well, let me ask you this.

Do you

think that this Court would sanction a prison policy that

10

said black prisoners can't eat in the dining hall with

11

white prisoners because they don't have any constitutional

12

rights?
MR. TUFANO:

13
14

I don't think this Court would

sanction it.
QUESTION:

15

I don't think so, either, and if

16

Congress were enacting legislation based on its perception

17

that handicapped people suffer from discriminatory

18

attitudes and practices, then Congress might think that

19

that should be stopped, just like the thing I just asked

20

you about.

21

I think that's possible.
MR. TUFANO:

It's possible, Your Honor, but

22

again, what Congress has done in -- if they have tried to

23

apply the ADA to State prisons, what they've done is

24

applied a different standard now to how prison management

have to deal with the disabled, and in your example of

blacks in the cafeteria, this Court has held that the

2

normal strict scrutiny analysis doesn't apply in the

3

prison context when fundamental rights or a suspect class

4

are involved.
You look at whether it's reasonably related to a

5
6

legitimate penalogical interest, and with the disabled,

7

this Court has held that they're not a suspect class, and

8

that with prisoners, even in the most strictest of
scrutiny situations, you wouldn't normally apply that, so

10

now we have --

11

QUESTION:

You wouldn't normally apply what?

12

QUESTION:

We don't have an as-applied challenge

13

here in --

14

MR. TUFANO:

15

QUESTION:

I understand.
-- the context that you are concerned

16

about, I think, and as I suggested before it's quite

17

possible that concerns for prison security would be

18

relevant in deciding what specific action a prison has to

1

take with regard to a specific handicapped prisoner.

20

MR. TUFANO:

Again, Your Honor, the problem is

21

that applying the ADA in title II to State prisoners will

22

shift the burden.

23

Currently, the actions or policies of a

Department of Corrections are presumed to be valid.

opinion is upheld, or what sort of things are the prison

8

administrators going to be confronted with?

9

MR. TUFANO:

Well, one of the things, and we

10

cite it in our brief, Your Honor, is in the Purcell case,

11

where an inmate was told that he had a doctor's

12

appointment, and he refused to go to the doctor's

13

appointment because he wanted to go into a cell and

14

release his tics because he had Tourette's Syndrome.

MR. TUFANO:

His tics, his -- the emotional

But in that case -- in that case, a

7

simple situation where an inmate is telling a corrections

8

guard, I don't have to go to my medical appointment, and
he was given the opportunity to sign a release if he

10

didn't go to the appointment.

11

because, I have Tourette's Syndrome and I'm allowed to go

12

into my cell and release my tics at my leisure.

13

He didn't want to do either

Now we're facing in that case the possibility of

14

punitive damages for the guards telling the inmate either

MR. TUFANO:

9

QUESTION:

Why is it different than under title

I'm sorry, Your Honor?
Why is it any different -- Congress

10

has said, here's a class, and thou shalt not discriminate,

11

but we recognize the need for reasonable regulations.

12

Congress says, thou shalt not discriminate in

13

prisons, you've conceded, even though they didn't use the

14

word prisons, on the basis of race, and apparently the

15

prison authorities are able to cope with that.

16

MR. TUFANO:

The difference is, Your Honor, it's

17

one thing to say, thou shalt not discriminate on the basis

18

of race, it's another thing, in the Americans With

19

Disabilities Act, to say you shall not discriminate on the

20

basis of disability in a program activity or service and

21

you shall affirmatively make accommodations for this

22

person, and you shall only pick your course of action if

23

you can show that there wasn't anything else available

24

according to what the inmate wanted.

regulations dealing with the application of this act say

2

things such as the following:

3

A public entity shall make reasonable

4

modifications in policies, practices, or procedures where

5

necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of

6

disability, and unless the entity can demonstrate that

7

making the modifications would fundamentally alter the

8

nature of the service, program or activity.

9

Now, that seems on its face to leave room for

10

prisons to say, it's not a reasonable modification that's

being sought, and it would alter the program or activity

that's necessary in the prison context.

What Justice O'Connor said, I thought was the

you produce examples where it seems they're requiring

unreasonable accommodation, so why don't you say to the

MR. TUFANO:

They should be able to, as they

MR. TUFANO:

The real problem is having the

Federal Government involved in State prison management.

6

That's the basic problem, having to have -- for the first

time treating disabled inmates different from everyone

else, knowing, as this Court has held, that preferential

treatment for inmates poses security problems in a prison.
QUESTION:

Why didn't anyone make this argument

to Congress?
MR. TUFANO:

12

Well, because I believe that --

13

Congress I don't believe made a clear statement in the

In that

that the physical activity is an essential part of the

MR. SPECTER:

Well, the regulations, which were

specifically incorporated into the statute within the text

of the act itself that were promulgated under section 504
and carried over to section (a) have an undue burden

Are there other examples that one

MR. SPECTER:

Well, I think the clearest way to

look to read what Congress meant about reasonableness in

the ADA is to look at the great body of law that's

16

developed under section 504, which has applied the

reasonable -- basically the same regulations that are --

18

were incorporated into the ADA.

19

And I think that's one of the ways that Congress

was being flexible and sensitive to the needs of the State

agencies, including Department of Corrections, by using a

word with which district court judges and other courts are

familiar and know how to apply in a sensible fashion, and

The words program and activity were statutorily

The court of appeals correctly held that the ADA

prohibits State prisons from discriminating against

17

disabled inmates in their programs, services, and

18

activities that they provide to inmates for three reasons:

1

First, the text of the act unambiguously

20

prohibits such discrimination, second, the application of

21

the ADA to prisons was a logical -- State prisons was a

22

logical extension of section 504 of the Rehabilitation

Act's application to Federal prisons and to State prisons

that receive Federal funding, and third, the interpretive

Beginning with the text, the act applies to any

I think I'm very interested,

Mr. Gornstein, if it does apply, how you interpret the
accommodation that's required in the prison context.
MR. GORNSTEIN:

Well, there would be two things

you would look to.
First of all, the backdrop of section 504, which

14

this Court interpreted in Southeastern Community College

15

v. Davis not to require accommodations that impose undue

16

burdens and not to require accommodations that would lead

17

to a fundamental alteration in the program, which in that

18

case included lowering standards and substantially

19

modifying a nursing program, and second of all you would

20

look to a general principle that this Court has applied in

21

section 504(2), to deferring to the reasonable medical

22

judgments of health professionals.

23

By a parity of reasoning, in the prison context

24

you would defer to the reasonable security judgments of

correctional officials in the context of an ADA case.

Let's suppose that a high

school had a physical conditioning program, very rigorous,

year per disabled student increase to run a separate track

program for the disabled student.
The same with the boot camp.

10

A disabled

prisoner wants to participate in boot camp.

It would cost

$5,000 a year for the second track for the disabled

$5,000 is more significant for a prison than it is for
