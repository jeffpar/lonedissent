ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS G. PANTAZIS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PANTAZIS:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The supreme court of Alabama has held there is

11

12

no section 42 U.S.C. section 1983 claim for a cause of

13

action if the victim dies from the perpetration of the

14

act.

15

death results from the deprivation of a Federal right

16

occurring in Alabama, does the Wrongful Death Act govern

17

the recovery of the decedent's estate?

18
19

The issue before this Court is, when the decedent's

QUESTION:

Are you going to address the

jurisdictional issue?

20

MR. PANTAZIS:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. PANTAZIS:

I will, if -- Your Honor.

I think you should.
The Federal issue has been

23

totally adjudicated by the supreme court of Alabama, and

24

under the Cox case this Court has held an exception, or

25

held that jurisdiction is found where there's no further

1

Federal issue to be adjudicated and cannot be adjudicated

2

at the lower court.

3

QUESTION:

But the Federal issue could become

4

academic if you go back and on the State claim there's a

5

determination that there was no wrongful conduct on the

6

part of the city.

7

MR. PANTAZIS:

Under -- in Cox it's my

8

understanding, Your Honor, is that the Court held this

9

exception:

where the Federal claim has been finally

10

decided and with further proceeding on the merits in the

11

State court to come, but that which later review of the

12

Federal issue cannot be had, whatever the ultimate outcome

13

of the case.

That was the third exception.

QUESTION:

14

But here you could conceivably, if

15

you should prevail on the State claim you could then bring

16

up that you should also have had a 1983 claim.

17

MR. PANTAZIS:

I don't believe so.

I think the

18

supreme court of Alabama has already adjudicated that in

19

this particular case.
QUESTION:

20

And they would then say, it's law of

21

the case, and so we deny -- in dealing with the appeal you

22

would have a final disposition, and you could come here

23

again.

24
25

In that respect it's different from Cox v. Cohn.
MR. PANTAZIS:

I think it is different, but I

think the rational of Cox is, looking at this particular

1

issue, this Court -- the Alabama supreme court has

2

adjudicated it to the fullest degree under the Federal

3

issue.
QUESTION:

4

The issue isn't whether they have

5

adjudicated it finally and will not come back to it.

6

You're quite right that they wouldn't come back to it.

7

The issue is whether we could pick it up later on, after

8

they simply say, it's law of the case, there is no Federal

9

cause of action.

At that point you have a final judgment,

10

the whole thing has been dismissed, and you could come

11

here.

Is there some reason why you couldn't come here?
MR. PANTAZIS:

12

It would require duplication in

13

trying the case twice, and I think that's part of the

14

rationale that Cox looked at.

15

QUESTION:

Sure.

Well, that may well be, but

16

we're bound by the Federal statute, which says that the

17

case has to be finally decided by the highest court of the

18

State, finally decided, and the highest court of the State

19

is going to have this case back again, or may well have

20

the case back again on the State law claims, no?
MR. PANTAZIS:

21

It could, but the problem, Your

22

Honor, is that the third element in Cox specifically, I

23

think, addressed that rationale.

24

claim was adjudicated in the Federal -- in the State

25

court.

It said that the Federal

QUESTION:

1

But it says where further Federal --

2

it says, but in which later review of the Federal issue

3

cannot be had, and under the law of the case, Alabama

4

could conceivably change its mind if there were some

5

intervening decision, perhaps by the Eleventh Circuit.

6

Probably it won't, but nevertheless, you can't say, in

7

which later review of the Federal issue cannot be had.

8

that's just not -- that's -- you just haven't complied
with that exception.
Now -- and maybe you might ask us to have some

10
11

further exception and say, well, it's duplicative, or

12

something like that, but I don't think you can come within

13

exception 3.
MR. PANTAZIS:

14

Well, I think, though, the

15

rationale in exception 3, if it does not meet this case,

16

it should meet this case, and maybe the Court should

17

accept that as a further -QUESTION:

18

I think perhaps the rationale of

1

section 3 was your -- a case called California v. Stewart

20

that was decided on -- where the State court says, this

21

evidence is inadmissible because it was violative of

22

Miranda.

23

to the trial court, the State is prevented from getting

24

that evidence in, so it's lost forever the right to review

25

that claim because the trial court won't accept it, and if

The State wants to appeal that.

If it goes back

1

there's a guilty verdict, or a not guilty verdict, the

2

State never will have an opportunity to review it.

3

You, on the other hand, will, as my colleagues

4

have pointed out, have -- could have an opportunity to

5

have this reviewed in a later proceeding.
MR. PANTAZIS:

6

I think that, Your Honor, Mr.

7

Chief Justice, I do not believe that we will, because I

8

think the supreme court of Alabama has reviewed the issue

9

and has accepted it for that particular purpose.
QUESTION:

10

Let's assume that, as I think my

11

colleagues have assumed, that the supreme court of Alabama

12

is going to say, as Justice Ginsburg, this is the law of

13

the case, we've decided it, but this is simply a necessary

14

step for you to then bring the case to us, and you will

15

not have the final judgment argument made against you at

16

that time.

17

MR. PANTAZIS:

If that rationale holds, then

18

this case would be tried once with a State remedy, which

19

would exclude the entire 1983 cause of action.

20

then go up before the supreme court of Alabama, and they,

21

as Justice Scalia points out, would probably say, we've

22

already covered this, you know, the issue is moot, and

23

we'd be here again 2 or 3 years on the same issue, having

24

gone through the system without any -- moving the case any

25

further.

It would

1

QUESTION:

Well, that's always --

2

QUESTION:

That's a happy ending.

3

lose on the State claim.

4

MR. PANTAZIS:

5

QUESTION:

6

You could

That's true.

And then the whole thing could be

washed out, right?

7

MR. PANTAZIS:

8

QUESTION:

That's true.

The problem is that's always true

when you take an interlocutory appeal.
10

MR. PANTAZIS:

11

QUESTION:

That's correct.

It's always true, so the statutes

12

balance and allow you sometimes to take an interlocutory

13

appeal, sometimes not, but we have a statute here that

14

doesn't allow it.

15

around that?

16

It doesn't allow this interlocutory thing to come up.

It says final, and is there anyway

I mean, I don't see -- the word is final.

17

MR. PANTAZIS:

18

QUESTION:

1

MR. PANTAZIS:

Well --

So how do we get around that?
I personally do not believe the

20

supreme court of Alabama will adjudicate the same Federal

21

issue again, and the reason is the defendants in this case

22

are going to say, this case is already decided.

That was

23

already addressed.

It was a

24

final order on the 1 83 issue.

25

I --

The parties were before it.
That's over with.

And

QUESTION:

1

We don't resolve finality issue by

2

issue.

I mean, our cases make it clear that if any of the

3

claims in the case are still alive, the judgment is not

4

final, and there are claims still alive here, the State

5

claims.

6

MR. PANTAZIS:

7

QUESTION:

8

The State claims are.

So the only way you can get out of

the problem is to say, this comes within one of the
exceptions, to wit, there's no other way to appeal this

10

Federal claim unless I can appeal it now, which was the

11

situation in the case that the Chief Justice described,

12

but I don't see why that's the situation here.

13

to me you can come back up here.

14

It seems

I know it takes 2 more years, and we're

15

duplicating effort and all of that, but that's what this

16

statute envisions.

17

I mean --

MR. PANTAZIS:

I believe the Court could expand,

18

if that's the term, in the Cox rationale and to allow this

1

particular appeal.

20

QUESTION:

Yes, but how could -- I mean, it's

21

like a trial judge.

22

against you at the beginning of the case.

The trial judge makes a ruling

23

MR. PANTAZIS:

24

QUESTION:

25

Yes.

You run up to the court of appeals,

you say, you know, judge, an awful lot of time and

1

effort's going to go by.

Why don't you and the court of

2

appeals reverse him now?

And if we have a statute that

3

says final, we can't do it.

4

statute that gave us the interlocutory right, or that gave

5

us, you know, the certificating right.

6

on a word that says final.

7

MR. PANTAZIS:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

me, here.

We have to look to some other

We couldn't do it

Right.

And that's the dilemma, it seems to

I'm putting that because maybe you can think of

something.

11

MR. PANTAZIS:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. PANTAZIS:

Well --

I don't know what it is.
The difference in that is that if

14

it is an issue, an evidentiary issue or something, it

15

would be adjudicated and revisited at the end of the

16

trial, as all evidentiary issues.

17

The issue of whether you have a cause of action

18

has reached the highest level it can reach in Alabama, and

19

it has been adjudicated at the highest level it can reach

20

within the Alabama system, and that issue has been taken

21

care of both from a fact standpoint and from a

22

representation of the parties, and I don't believe the

23

supreme court of Alabama can go back and review it.

24

already said, I've made that decision on that issue.

25

I think that we would be -10

It's

QUESTION:

1

Suppose there were some intervening

2

decisions.

3

you made a mistake here, there are some intervening

4

decisions from this Court, or from a court of appeals of

5

the Eleventh Circuit, which there might well be, please

6

take another look at this?

7

that.

8

take it, in Alabama.

9

Couldn't you tell the Alabama supreme court,

They have the discretion to do

The rule of law of the case is discretionary, I

MR. PANTAZIS:

They possibly could do that, Your

10

Honor, but in -- because the supreme court of Alabama has

11

ruled on a motion to dismiss pleadings -- this was not a

12

summary judgment.

13

it dismissed the counts in this case that involved 1983,

14

and they're forever gone, and the supreme court of Alabama

15

has ruled that issue finality.

16

present in the State court and in the trial court.

17

QUESTION:

It was a motion to dismiss pleadings --

Those issues are no longer

If you were to prevail on the State

18

claim and then ultimately prevail here on your 1983 case,

19

you wouldn't have to have a whole new trial.

20

get some mileage from the State, the trial on the State

21

claim in which you succeeded so that you wouldn't have to

22

duplicate all that evidence?

23

MR. PANTAZIS:

Couldn't you

I would think not, and the reason

24

is because the State measure of damages in Alabama for

25

wrongful death is the wrongfulness of the conduct of the

punitive, and if -- 1983 against municipalities is

compensatory damages only.

4

damages for wrongful death.
QUESTION:

6

It is not compensatory.

It is purely

There is no compensatory

but with respect to the liability and

fault -MR. PANTAZIS:

7

Well, the issues that would be

8

tried in the case in the -- for the wrongful death, the

9

issues and the evidence and even the measure of damages,

10

what the jury is allowed to consider, would totally be

11

different.
QUESTION:

12

13

Measure of damages would certainly be

different, but I don't understand why the --

14

MR. PANTAZIS:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

The conduct --

The fault issues would necessarily be

different.
MR. PANTAZIS:

It may not, Your Honor.

It

18

may -- a lot of it would parallel, but a lot of it --

19

there's also issues that would be allowable in '83 from an

20

evidentiary standpoint that wouldn't be allowable or

21

relevant just for a wrongful death case.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Pantazis, just for fun, why don't

you tell us about the merits of the case.

MR. PANTAZIS:

Your Honor, this case involves a

The allegations in the complaint, and as the

16

record reflects, this was a custom and practice of

17

depriving black citizens in Tarrant, Alabama of

18

fundamental equal protection rights under the Fourteenth

19

Amendment, and we had filed a section 1983 cause of

20

action, and as this Court knows, section 1983 does not

21

provide a remedy, remedial damage remedy under that

22

section.

23

We have to look for guidance to 1988.
1988 tells us that we look first, or consider

24

first the State common law and State statutory law, and if

25

that is not inconsistent with the purpose and policy of

1

the Federal Constitution, the United States laws it's

2

intended to protect, then we apply it, but if it is, that

3

is the balancing test, or that is the test that the courts

4

must look at.
This Court in Robertson v. Wegman has held that

5
6

the purpose and policy of 1 83 is to compensate and to

7

prevent prevention of abuses and power by those acting

8

under color of State law, or in my words, deterrence, and
if you apply that standard to what we have in Alabama, or

10

we're left with in Alabama -- because what's left are two

11

State statutes.

12

statute, which is cited at 6-5-410, and as I've indicated

13

is purely compensatory.

One of them is the wrongful death

Even the supreme court's decision in this case

14
15

states that, I think, in the first or second paragraph --

16

excuse me.

It's purely punitive.

17

misstated.

It's purely punitive, and the jury charges,

18

they're admonished never to consider any compensatory

1

aspects, just punitive, it certainly frustrates the

20

purpose of compensation.
QUESTION:

21

I said compensatory.

Why -- you say it frustrates the

22

purpose.

23

and it certainly doesn't frustrate the purpose of

24

deterrence.

25

I

A moment ago you said the purpose is deterrence,

It's a classic example of a deterrent remedy.

MR. PANTAZIS:

That's correct, it does satisfy

1

the second element of deterrence, but it frustrates the

2

first element of underlying policy of compensation.

3

There is a second statute that comes into play.

4

QUESTION:

5
6

7
8

9

Well, it doesn't satisfy it.

I don't

know that it frustrates it.
MR. PANTAZIS:

Well, it runs in conflict with

it, Your Honor.
There's a second statute that frustrates both,
is inconsistent with both policies, and that is section

10

11-93-2, which arbitrarily places a limit of $100,000 on

11

any recovery against a municipality, which would apply in

12

this case with no 1983 cause of action.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. PANTAZIS:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

But we don't get to that, do we?
We do --

Well, we don't get to it because of

the Federal rule, right?
MR. PANTAZIS:

Well, if we have no 83 claim, as

18

the supreme court of Alabama has said, it's all State.

19

The supreme court did not modify its wrongful death --

20

QUESTION:

No, but your argument, as I

21

understand it, is that even to the extent of the

22

deterrence there is a frustration of purpose here because

23

the punitive damages cannot be recovered against the

24

municipality.

25

Isn't that your argument?

MR. PANTAZIS:

That is -- that is an argument.

1

We take the position, Your Honor, that because it's purely

2

punitive, that it doesn't comply with the compensatory

3

aspects, while it may comply with the deterrence.

4

The court, the supreme court of Alabama has said

5

that in removing the 1983 action, and that's what it did,

6

it dismissed it, said that we are now under the wrongful

7

death.

8

the statute that arbitrarily limits us to $100,000

9

damages, and that frustrates both deterrence as well as

10
11
12

While we're under that statute, we're also under

compensation.
QUESTION:

Yes, but you never get to that limit

because of the effect of the Federal law, do you?

13

MR. PANTAZIS:

14

QUESTION:

Well --

MR. PANTAZIS:

Yes.

I do not challenge it.

I

agree with your statement.
I do not challenge it because what we're saying
is, if we have a 1 83 claim, then the limitation would not

apply, and that's why it's so important that this Court

11

consider and instruct the supreme court of Alabama that

our 1 83 claim is not satisfied by the Alabama wrongful

If we don't have an 83 claim, if the case is as

Mrs. Jefferson's death and pain and suffering, as opposed

to anything suffered by the children or the spouse.

4

MR. PANTAZIS:

We are asking for the damages as

listed in the Weeks case, which was a district court case

6

in Alabama, which did say that the estate's damages are

7

the measure of the pain and suffering, the funeral

QUESTION:

2

Mr. Pantazis,

there's a distinction,

3

I'm sure you are aware, between survival statutes and

4

wrongful death acts, and one is thought as compensating

5

the bereaved family members, and the other is thought as

6

going to the estate, as the claims that the decedent would

7

have if she had survived, her pain and suffering, and that

8

goes to the estate.
But you seem,

9

in your answer to Justice

10

O'Connor,

11

cast your complaint in survival act terms, and yet in your

12

response just now about the family members you seem to be

13

shifting over to the wrongful death mode.

14

to blend those two, and I was wondering why you

MR. PANTAZIS:

I believe, Your Honor,

the

15

damages go to the decedent's estate.

16

the wrongful death damages or the 1983 damages would go to

17

the estate, and would be passed --

damages would go to her estate.

MR. PANTAZIS:

1

Well, we are asking for both, but

2

the way you compensate a decedent for death in reality,

3

and what most of the States have done, is by compensating

4

the heirs for what they have lost, or the descendents for

5

what they have lost.
QUESTION:

6

Well, not in the normal survival

7

action.

8

whoever is the beneficiary of the estate gets the money,

9

but that's analytically quite distinct from a death action

10

The money goes into the estate and, of course,

brought on behalf of the survivors.
I don't -- I -- if you want to limit yourself to

MR. PANTAZIS:

2

The only -- if you're speaking of

would not allow that under Alabama common law, statutory

law.

QUESTION:

You say that under Alabama law, for a

wrongful death, the proceeds have to go to the estate?

MR. PANTAZIS:

No.

The proceeds are -- the

11

of action, the personal representative through the estate,

12

that the administrator is in conflict with the heirs.
What we're asking is that this Court instruct

the supreme court of Alabama that the 19 -- that there

cannot abolish the 1983 action, because in doing so it

directly is inconsistent with the purpose of compensation

and deterrence and, in doing so, we're asking this Court

7

to instruct the supreme court of Alabama that the 1983

cause of action is supplemental to the wrongful death

statute, and that the damages that are allowable under

10

1983 are those typical compensatory damages that are found

11

in 48 or 49 other States.

12

QUESTION:

Where would the Court be getting

13

those rules from?

14

because Alabama allows only a punitive damage recovery.

They don't -- and 1983 itself doesn't tell us.

MR. ROBERTS:

Justice Marshall's opinion did

point out that this was peculiar in the sense that the

decedent, Mr. Shaw, was not survived by parent, child, or

6

sibling.

7

That was what Louisiana limited survivorship to.
But it was not the case that there was any

finding that he had no heirs at all, that he didn't have a

9

will -- the case was brought by his executor -- that there

10

was nobody who stood to inherit if, in fact, he could get

damages, but the Court said the compensation interest is

12

not implicated because the person on whose behalf you're

suing as representative of the estate cannot be

compensated.

QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, can I ask just a little

whether punitive damages are available in the 1983 case is

We do think that's wrong, and we

So that what in effect you're arguing

is, there isn't a general cause of action here.

That's right, and, of course, it's

not an approach that it's adopted in any way

There is a criminal provision now codified at section 242

which could also be invoked in cases of murder, and there

was 1 88 which says, look to State law to fill gaps in

this remedial program and, to the extent States allowed

survival or wrongful death actions, perhaps the Congress

thought that those would be invoked to recover in those

provisions when 1 83 was enacted.

to supplement it from some other source.
MR. ROBERTS:

The fact that you get a different

result from State to State, as this Court recognized in

24

Robertson, is, of course, a necessary consequence of the

25

terms of 1988.

You could have minor variations, who

incompatible with the idea of a recovery to have this

setup which says, you get -- you end up getting nothing?
MR. ROBERTS:

12

Well, I think it begs the question

13

to say that 1983 assumes there's going to be recovery in

cases of survivor and wrongful death.

MR. ROBERTS:

But the only way to have a

survival or wrongful death cause of action under 1983 is

by incorporating the State law, because when 1983 was

passed there was no survival or wrongful death at common

law.

The most that can be said is that they would give

Here, Alabama does provide such a right, and it

doesn't leave them with no remedy.

11

you still have a remedy under 1983 applying the Alabama

rule against individuals, and this Court has recognized

repeatedly in Robertson, in Carlson, and in Fact Concerts,

that the most effective deterrent is an action against the

MR. ROBERTS:

I think not, largely because at

3

the time 1982 was passed many States -- I'm not sure if

4

there was quite a majority or not, but many had such caps.

5

Congress put a cap in in the only wrongful death provision

6

it provided in 1986.

7

The situation in Alabama under the Wrongful

8

Death Act is quite similar to the situation this Court has

formulated under Bivens.

We know from FDIC v. Myer that

10

you have a Bivens action against Federal officials, the

individuals, but no Bivens action against the agency.

12

Here, applying the Alabama Wrongful Death Act

13

you have a 1983 action in the case of wrongful death in

Alabama against individuals for punitive damages, but you
