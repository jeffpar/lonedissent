ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE R. ABRAMOWITZ

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

MR. ABRAMOWITZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The setting for this statutory interpretation

13

case is, alas, subchapter L of the Internal Revenue Code,

14

which contains, as this Court has recognized, highly

15

specialized, carefully crafted rules for determining the

16

taxable income of insurance companies.

17

The petitioner's position in this case is

18

straightforward and very simply stated.

19

with a transition rule that Congress adopted in 1986 with

20

respect to a change in the taxations methodology for

21

unpaid losses of insurance companies, it provided fresh

22

start relief, a very favorable provision, but excluded

23

from that fresh start relief reserve strengthening.

24
25

In connection

Reserve strengthening was the term of art that
Congress used in the statute.

Reserve strengthening had,

2

in 1986, a decades-old meaning in insurance tax law.
QUESTION:

But isn't that a disputed point?

I

3

mean, the Government tells us it didn't, and said we have

4

witnesses to say it didn't have.

5

MR. ABRAMOWITZ:

The -- I -- it's unclear,

6

actually, Justice Ginsburg, the extent to which the

7

Government disputes the history of the meaning of reserve

8

strengthening in insurance tax law.

9

and in the Western National case the Government conceded

10

that the term, reserve strengthening had a clear meaning

11

in the context of life insurance taxation.

12

whether the meaning was clear in the context of property

13

and casualty tax --

14

QUESTION:

In this case below

It disputed

Which is what we're talking about

15

here, and they had two witnesses to say in property and

16

casualty, at least, the meaning is not a term of art.

17

There are multiple meanings.

18

MR. ABRAMOWITZ:

19

QUESTION:

So --

The Government --

-- I'm just bringing that up to say

20

that it isn't -- can't be clear that it is a term of art

21

in the kind of insurance we're talking about.

22

MR. ABRAMOWITZ:

In the context of this case it

23

is petitioner's position that the term, reserve

24

strengthening, was a tax term of art, that Congress knew

25

precisely what the term meant when it used it, that in

1

fact the distinction between life insurance and property-

2

casualty insurance in this context is really not at all

3

relevant.

4

The -- subchapter L of the Internal Revenue Code

5

covers both types of companies.

6

both -- it's been loosely called a provision that applies

7

to property and casualty companies but, in fact, it

8

applies to both life insurance companies and property and

9

casualty companies and, indeed, the difference between

This provision applied to

10

life and -- what we're calling life insurance companies

11

and property-casualty companies really, in subchapter L of

12

the Internal Revenue Code, is only a question of the

3

relationship between the amount of reserves they hold to

4

qualify as life insurance reserves and the amount of

5

reserves they hold that are --

6

QUESTION:

Well, what are the differences in

7

reserve accounting between the life insurance and the

8

property and casualty insurance businesses?

9

MR. ABRAMOWITZ:

Insofar as relevant to this

20

case, Justice O'Connor, there are none.

2

differences, because obviously a life insurance policy

22

covers one sort of risk and a property-casualty insurance

23

policy covers a different sort of risk.

24
25

QUESTION:

There are

Well, I thought there was a big

difference.

1

I thought the difference with life insurance is,

2

if I sell a policy today and I take the income in and I'm

3

going to have to pay it out in 30 years, I use a bunch of

4

statistical tables that tell me people's life expectancy.

5

If I'm in the casualty business, at the end of

6

the year in which I've received the premium I have to make

7

what I'd call an educated guess about how many

8

tornadoes -- there were some tornadoes, but I mean, how

9

many houses actually were flattened and how many people

10

are out there with television sets that they haven't put

11

their property claim in yet, and there aren't some tables

12

I can go to.

13

educated guesses about to what extent the policy that was

14

sold in year one is going to result in a claim for that

15

year that I'll have to pay out in year 10.

16

I thought people sit there and they make

I thought that's quite a big difference, so that

17

seemed to me difference one, and difference two is that

18

you had a sentence in the bill that would -- they have a

19

sentence in the bill that says, in the life insurance

20

case, you know, strengthening is -- does not -- you know

21

the sentence I'm referring to.

22

It's right there.

It wins your case if you were in the life

23

insurance, and it's gone in your case, and they put it in

24

in the Senate in your bill, and the House took it out.

25

So there we are.

We have a difference in

practice, we have a difference in language in the bill,

2

and we have a difference in the legislative history where

3

you won your battle in the Senate and you lost it in the

4

House.

5

Now, given that, how do you win the case?

6

MR. ABRAMOWITZ:

7

All right, I need to back up

just a step, Justice Breyer.

8

The -- first with respect to the comparability

9

of the businesses, they surely cover two different types

10

of risk.

11

with the nature of the reserves, and the reserves in both

12

cases are based upon assumptions and methodologies, and

13

that is the relevant point, because that is a point that

14

is embedded in the definition of the term, reserve

15

strengthening, and let me go to the question, if I may, of

16

the sentence, because backing all the way up --

17

I think Justice O'Connor's question had to do

QUESTION:

I think that's very important, and I

18

think we should stay with the format of Justice Breyer's

19

question, but just taking the first part of his question

20

to help us to understand these things, isn't it true that

21

in the life area reserves are usually changed because of

22

methodologies and in the casualty area because of

23

empirical reports that there have been -- that there have

24

been losses and so forth?

25

In the life area, people don't say, oh, you

know, this policyholder has just been diagnosed with

2

cancer, we're going to change the risk.

3

that.

4

tell me if that's wrong, but --

5

They don't do

But in the casualty area, I take it they do.

MR. ABRAMOWITZ:

Now,

Well, in fact -- that is

6

correct, but in fact the comparable -- when they make that

7

change in the property-casualty area that is the normal

8

reserve increase.

9

When they make a change in the life area, the

10

normal increase is the adjustment year-by-year that the

11

actuaries have built in for additional interest

12

assumptions and mortality adjustments and so on, but

13

14

QUESTION:

So that, as a general matter, reserve

15

changes -- other than for the addition of new policies

16

reserve changes are made in the life area because of

17

methodology changes and in the casualty area because of

18

empirical assessments about actual losses.

19

MR. ABRAMOWITZ:

No, Justice Kennedy, I think

20

actually I'm disagreeing with that point, because in the

21

life area there are regular, routine, normal reserve

22

changes each and every year, increases in reserves,

23

adjustments to reserves.

24

QUESTION:

For what reasons?

MR. ABRAMOWITZ:

The formula for determining

1

life insurance reserves has to do with determining the

2

present value -- the relationship between the present

3

value of future benefits and the present value of future

4

net premiums, and those things really adjust every year.

5

They simply have normal adjustments every year.

6

QUESTION:

And those are different than

methodology changes.
MR. ABRAMOWITZ:

Exactly, and that's the very

important point I'm trying to make, that there is a

10

fundamental comparability and certainly Congress was aware

11

of this, because I want to go back to Justice Breyer's

12

question, that in the normal adjustments to reserves,

13

things that happen without anything extraordinary,

14

anything untoward or mischievous, potentially mischievous,

15

and adjustments to reserves that result from changes in

16

methods and assumptions.

17

It's the latter item that really is the

18

adjustment item that can produce distortion, and I think

19

both in the context of 1984 and in the context of 1986 the

20

well-known reserve strengthening kind of standard was the

21

protection that Congress built in to protect against

22

distortion, to protect against anybody taking undue

23

advantage of the fresh start rule.

24
25

QUESTION:

Okay.

The plausibility of what you

say about the comparability of the way adjustments are

made depends, I guess, on understanding the kinds of

2

nonmethodological adjustments that are made in the life

3

insurance area and you gave that rather a quick treatment,

4

as if we understood, and I don't.

5

Could you explain some of those

6

nonmethodological adjustments in the reserves in the life

7

insurance area that make it comparable to the kind of

8

adjustments, nonmethodological adjustments that are made

9

in the property and casualty?

10

MR. ABRAMOWITZ:

Actually, it's easier to think

11

about it from the other side, Justice Souter.

12

methodological assumptions happen in both cases, because

13

actuaries determine reserves and actuaries determine

14

formulas and actuaries change formulas and assumptions.

15

The

On the property-casualty side, and I'm using

16

that term in a -- not an attack sense, just in the nature

17

of that business -- there are adjustments to reserves that

18

result every year in a normal fashion by virtue of the

19

existing formulas and existing methods that are used to

20

determine those reserves.

21

QUESTION:

Because insurance adjusters call in

22

and they say, you know, there was a big loss, the roof

fell in, things like that.

MR. ABRAMOWITZ:

2

There is certainly that

3

element, but that is just --

4

QUESTION:

5

Is there any comparable

element in life insurance?
MR. ABRAMOWITZ:

7

Okay.

No.

On that element there is

not.

8

QUESTION:

Okay.

9

MR. ABRAMOWITZ:

On that element there is not,

10

but that is just one element of a determination of

11

property and casualty reserves.

12

In this case the petitioner had a substantial

13

portion of its reserves determined on the basis of the

14

formulas and methods that actuaries had in place for

15

determining the incurred-but-not-reported losses of the

16

insurance company and for determining loss adjustment

17

expenses of the insurance company, and those formulas are

18

formulas that -- there are many possibilities for those

19

formulas, but the actuaries in this company simply

20

selected a formula and a method to apply, and it's that

21

sort of formula that is -- that was susceptible of being

22

changed, adjusted, in manipulating the fresh start rule.

23

QUESTION:

The formula's not the problem.

nonformula factors exist in the life insurance area.
MR. ABRAMOWITZ:

Each and every year, life

insurance reserves increase as a result -- probably the

4

simplest way to put this, of the insured becoming closer

5

to death, or --

QUESTION:

Right, but that's -- that's

kind -- if I understand what you're saying, that kind of

I mean, that's a

10

adjustment does not reflect a change in methodology, it

11

reflects an implementation of the methodology, and what I

12

want to know is, what kind of reserve changes in the life

13

area do not reflect implementations of previous

14

methodology?

15

MR. ABRAMOWITZ:

I would think those -- the

16

kinds that do not reflect implementations of previous

17

methodology are the kind that involve changes in methods

18

and assumptions.

I think --

guess that's an example where you might need to strengthen

2

reserves in life insurance without changing methodology.

Am I right?

I'm testing out my understanding of it.

MR. ABRAMOWITZ:

-- that's probably your problem.

1

errors and other types of adjustments, but I think there

2

is -- from that direction there is clearly some

3

distinction between the normal adjustments in property and

4

casualty and normal adjustments in life.

5

But that is really I think the wrong direction

6

to be looking at this case on, because I think if you

7

assume that this is -- this being the reserve

8

strengthening exclusion from the fresh start benefit that

9

Congress intended, and if you attribute to it an objective

10

to prevent mischievous, artificial things, you know you've

11

accomplished that, I think, when you have caught people

12

who have adjusted their methods and assumptions.

13

frankly that is what Congress had to have meant when it

14

used the term that it was well aware of.

15

I think

I think you always have to keep in mind here

16

that the respondent's position and the regulation it wrote

17

simply took the words, reserve strengthening, read them

18

out of the Internal Revenue Code, read them out of the act

19

and substituted the word, all increases.

QUESTION:

It's --

Mr. Abramowitz, if we could go back

21

to the second part of Justice Breyer's question, that is,

if one looked only at that Senate report one would say,

inclusive than what you are now describing to us.

The sentence in the Senate report that

had nothing whatever to do with the definition of reserve

The sentence that the respondents pointed out

First off, it's peculiar

because it's stated as a negative rule.

it really related to was reserve strengthening at the end

the sentence, and we have pointed to evidence that the

there really is no actual evidence as to what particular

QUESTION:

All right, then why -- what is your

answer, then, to this argument.

1

is -- would normally be raised, and the Government raises

20

it, that the very fact that that sentence is in there

23

practices.

2

what that reason was for a particular rule, then we're

3

back to the negative implication, and the negative

4

implication seems to support, clearly supports the

5

Government.
So I don't understand in the -- if you don't

6

7

have a particular explanation for why there was a need for

8

that sentence for those -- for contracts of those years, I

9

don't see how you get out of the negative implication.
MR. ABRAMOWITZ:

10
11

out.

Well, several things to point

The House bill in 1984 did not have the sentence.

12

The sentence came in, I believe, in the Senate

13

bill with a view to accommodating the mid-year effective

14

date that existed for, or target date, announcement date

15

for the change in 1984, and what the sentence I think had

16

to do with was a need to provide some relief for some

17

actions during 1984 that would have been captured under a

18

normal definition of reserve strengthening.

19

But because they were taken and then adjusted

20

by the end of 1984, Congress -- the Senate first, and then

21

ultimately the whole congress was providing a measure of

22

relief for that situation, as long as the reserves did not

23

exceed what the method -- what reserves on the same method

24

would have produced --

I -- it seems to me that the companies could be taking

2

those kinds of actions with respect to contracts entered

into in any year, and why did they -- why did they single

out contracts entered into in one particular year?

5

MR. ABRAMOWITZ:

Companies could take those

6

actions with respect to contracts and enter into any year

7

and, indeed, those are the very actions that are

8

prescribed by the reserve strengthening rule.

9

there must have been a unique set of circumstances that

I think

10

existed with respect to particular companies and

11

particular taxpayers for new contracts in 1984.

QUESTION:

13

MR. ABRAMOWITZ:

Congress didn't tell you what

14

it was, but they didn't tell you in the House bill and

15

they really didn't -- in 1986, when they got rid of the

16

mid-year effective date, in effect, the trigger, which

17

started out in the Senate bill as a March -- reserve

18

strengthening after March 1, and the final conference bill

modified that treatment.

If you're -- if you are correct that reserve strengthening

I think the only explanation I can give is that it appears

that it is responsive to a set of circumstances where

It is not defined in any dictionary or
It lacks a consistent industry usage.

11

The scope and meaning of the term depends upon

12

its context, and in the context of the Tax Reform Act of

13

1986 it is manifest that Congress consciously employed the

14

term in its broadest sense to encompass any and all

15

increases to existing reserves made during that year, the

16

year that that act was pending before Congress.

was anomalous was that Congress allowed a double deduction

Yes.

I think you could argue either

side of it, and I certainly don't think it's been applied

QUESTION:

I don't think the words are stronger,

Can we get the meaning of reserve

strengthening from the statute alone?
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

I -Or do we have to look at that

regulation to know what it means?
MR. JONES:

I think you can get the meaning of

13

the statute by the ordinary application of interpretive

14

principles that the Court applies.

15

The text of the regulation makes clear the broad

16

intent simply by the fact that the Court's already

17

discussed, which is that the Senate version of the bill

18

had enclosed -- included a limiting clause that would have

19

made it applicable only to changes in reserves due to

20

changes in methodologies.

21

That provision from the Senate bill was,

22

course, derived from the '84 reserve strengthening

23

provision that had applied that same language in

24

describing the transitional rule for life insurance

25

provisions.

QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, if your position is the

right one here, what differences are there at bottom

10

between the life insurance reserve strengthening and the

11

property and casualty reserve strengthening?

12

MR. JONES:

Well, the '84 act governs the life

13

insurance reserve strengthening provision, and it is

14

limited to changes in reserves caused by changes in the

15

reserve methodologies.

16

have been more clear than stating in the conference

17

report, and as the changes in the text also show, was

18

designed to be much broader.

19

The '86 act, as Congress could not

It was designed to cover three categories that

20

the conference committee report discusses, changes in

21

estimates of a particular reserve, changes in reserve

22

methodology like in the '84 area, and then to make the

23

breadth of its intent perfectly clear said, any other

24

unspecified or unallocated additions to reserves.

QUESTION:

So for that period of time no

increases of reserves qualify for the double deduction.
MR. JONES:

6

For the eighty -- in -- no reserve

7

strengthening in '86, no reserve increases for existing

8

reserves get the double deduction under the '86 act.

9

That's what this case is about.
QUESTION:

10

Now, you changed your position on the

11

equivalence of the statutes in your brief to this Court or

12

the lower court, or is that a mischaracterization?
MR. JONES:

13

I don't -- I don't follow the

14

question.

We haven't changed our characterization of the

15

statutes.

I think I know what you're referring to.

16

Petitioner says in its reply brief that we've changed our

17

pitch, if you will, about whether there had been a prior

18

usage in the life insurance industry, about what in the

19

life insurance industry reserve strengthening was used.

20

That's a misrepresentation of our position.

21

What we have done in our brief is respond to a new

22

argument that petitioner is making.

23

petitioner relied on the proposition that industry usage

24

showed the plain meaning of the term, but the record in

25

this case and its own witnesses don't support that.

In the courts below,

35

Its own witnesses acknowledge there are many-

1

2

different uses of the term and there is no well-defined

3

application of reserve strengthening in the property and

4

casualty industry, so petitioner has abandoned the

5

position about what industry usage means.
What they argue here is that reserve

6

7

strengthening is what they call a tax term.

It has a tax

8

meaning that somehow exists wholly apart from industry

9

usage and apart from legislative intent.
There isn't such a thing as a tax term of that

10
11

ilk.

There are some tax terms like capital gains and

12

ordinary and necessary business expenses that have

13

distinctive meanings.
Reserve strengthening is an industry term.

14

It

15

draws its meaning from industry usage.

16

is mixed and depends on context and in the context of the

17

'86 act Congress meant to give it its broadest scope.
QUESTION:

18

The industry usage

And you have always interpreted the

19

term to mean the same in the '84 and the '86 act, subject,

20

of course, to the fact that there's a qualification in the

21

'84 act.

22

MR. JONES:

Yes.

We have interpreted the term

23

the same way, but what I thought you were asking me about

24

was, do we accept that in the life insurance industry

25

usage, not this tax term of art idea, but that there was

1

an industry usage in life insurance to refer to reserve

2

strengthening as meaning a change in reserve methodology.

3

We don't dispute that.

What we have always

4

disputed is that no such industry usage applies to

5

property and casualty insurance, that the term has

6

different meanings and different contexts, and that's what

7

the witnesses in this case acknowledged, and that's

8

certainly what the conference committee report of this

9

legislation indicates.
QUESTION:

10

11

Well, let me just do it one more

time.
You have always taken the position that the

12

13

The --

term, reserve strengthening, means the same in each act.

14

MR. JONES:

15

QUESTION:

16

clause that's in the '84 act.

17
18

MR. JONES:

The only -Subject, of course, to this special

Yes.

It's only been used twice, so

it's easy to answer that question.

19

It doesn't appear anywhere in the Internal

20

Revenue Code.

The only two times where this term has been

21

used is in the '84 transitional rule and in the '86

22

transitional rule, and in the '84 rule it was confined by

23

this phrase about it doesn't apply unless you've changed

24

your methodology, and in the '86 rule that phrase was

25

deleted.

So the term has been used by Congress with the

1

same meaning in both places.

3

act they limit it with the additional language that they

4

didn't use in '86.

5

QUESTION:

It's just that in the '84

I thought maybe -- help me out on

6

this.

7

Kennedy that the difference in agency usage in the life

8

area was such that the proviso simply conformed the term

9

exactly to the way the life people were using it.

10

That's

not what you mean.
MR. JONES:

11
12

I thought at one point you were saying to Justice

It may be that that's the effect of

the proviso.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. JONES:

Yes.
But I don't think that was the

15

object of it.

I mean, you can't look at the proviso and

16

say -- if you look at the proviso in '84 and you think

17

that reserve strengthening means what petitioner says,

18

well, you don't need the proviso.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. JONES:

That's right, yes.
And so it must have meant -- if you

21

will, it must have meant something more, and what -- it

more, and in the '86 act, clearly Congress wanted it to

mean more to prevent this double deduction from being

expanded beyond what they were willing to tolerate.

QUESTION:

I don't know if you can correct my

problem with the double deduction.

7

I couldn't quite

The reason I couldn't understand it when I

8

looked at your example was, I understood the idea of a

9

person having a reserve, and they then discounted it,

10

wrote it down from $10 to $9, and normally that would mean

11

you have to take a dollar into income, but Congress

12

forgave that.

13

Then time passes, and 2 years go by, and at that

14

point they pay the loss of $10, in which case they deduct

15

that, and then they -- they've increased their reserve by

MR. JONES:

The double deduction will accrete

the claim remains outstanding and unpaid, so if you've

That argument's

The first is, what the regulation does is

exactly what Congress wanted to be done.

mean.

QUESTION:

In your view, if there's an old

2

policy and an old loss in the casualty area, and it's just

3

discovered, can you increase the reserve for that without

4

strengthening the reserve?

5

MR. JONES:

No.

If you had an existing

6

policy -- let's say in 1986 you discovered a claim came up

7

under a 1982 year.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. JONES:

Right.
Would that cause reserve

10

strengthening in '86, and the answer is, I don't know.

11

The answer -- the reason I don't know is because you've

12

got this account called reserve for claims incurred but

13

not reported, and so you might simply transfer a portion

14

of that reserve into a case reserve for this claim that

15

you have now discovered that has now been reported, and if

16

that's what happened, then there's been no reserve

17

strengthening in '86.

18

It might be that you didn't do that.

You just

created a new case reserve.

reduction in the reserve for claims incurred but not

reported, and yes, that would be reserve strengthening.

If you have that reserve for that

very purpose and you don't use it for that purpose.

3

MR. JONES:

Well, that's -- you could look at it

4

that way, but I think frankly that the whole concept of

5

reserve methodologies doesn't fit comfortably with

6

property and casualty insurance, because property and

casualty insurance look backwards.

case reserve for $10, it's a wash.

4

It's not a reserve

You -- insurance companies know today that

5

they're going to get claims coming along over a good-

sized period of years, even though the claims have already

been incurred, they haven't been reported, and so they

provide for that with a separate reserve for that kind of

a claim, that situation.

10

And as we tried to describe in our brief, the

11

problem with the factual hypotheticals that petitioner

12

gives us is, they don't give any consideration to that

aspect of reserves, and they're based upon what I think is

14

fairly described as a frivolous suggestion that insurance

that congressional objective.
