ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN BAUMGARTNER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. BAUMGARTNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The Petitioner in this cause would like to

12

accent three questions in this case this morning, if

3

possible.

4

legitimate and competitive interest in the maximum prices

5

which are charged by the people who carry their products.

6

Second, that the rule in Albrecht actually hinders, rather

7

than enhances, economic efficiency and competition.

8

third, that the foundations of Albrecht were destroyed by

9

the decisions in Sylvania and Arco.

20

First, that manufacturers and suppliers have a

And,

Unless a manufacturer or a supplier operates his

2

own retail outlets, the only means he has for reaching

22

consumers is through retailers.

23

those retailers vitally affect the degree to which his

24

products are sold.

25

And the activities of

For instance, in this particular case, Khan

1

sales were also State Oil sales.

2

legitimate business interest in seeing to it that those

3

sales were handled in the most effective manner possible.

4

Any action by Mr. Khan which reduced those sales also

5

reduced State Oil's sales, income and profits.

6

And State Oil had a

We believe that this is the incentive which a

7

manufacturer or a wholesaler has when he attempts to

8

introduce a maximum retail price.

9

the rule in Albrecht hinders, rather than supports,

We also believe that

10

competition, and maximum economic efficiency, because it

11

prevents manufacturers from ensuring that economic

12

incentives offered at the wholesale level are passed on to

13

the targeted consumers, who actually determine the

14

competitive outcome.

15

For example, a dealer who wishes a price

16

reduction, or a manufacturer who wishes to establish a

17

price reduction, are unable to agree, at least to the

18

degree of an enforceable arrangement, that this price

19

reduction will be passed on to the consumer.

20

supplier or the manufacturer is therefore discouraged from

21

utilizing price reductions as a man -- as a means of

22

enhancing sales of his products.

23

And the

A dealer who wishes an exclusive territory, or a

24

manufacturer who wishes to establish exclusive

25

territories, are again discouraged from utilizing that

1

means, because the manufacturer and the supplier are

2

unable to obtain enforceable assurances that the dealer,

3

or that some dealers, will not ultimately use that

4

exclusive territory to be able to increase the price of

5

the product which they're selling.
In this case, when the price ceiling was

6

7

ignored, the consumer who purchased premium gasoline paid

8

a higher price for that gasoline, and the additional

9

effect of an inability of the manufacturer, or the

10

wholesaler, to limit the maximum price is that an

11

increased price can be passed on to the consumer.

12

only thing which the rule in Albrecht really encourages is

13

vertical integration on the part of manufacturers and

14

suppliers.

and were not anti-competitive, Sylvania also rejected the

2

concept of freedom of dealers as an antitrust concept.

3

This leaves as the only real foundation for Albrecht an

4

objection to price restraints as such.
QUESTION:

5

Are there some markets where freedom

6

for the dealers is -- is important?

7

circumstances in which it's advantageous -- and I won't

8

say whether it's pro-competitive, but advantageous -- to

9

have dealers with substantial strength and substantial

10

freedom?
MR. BAUMGARTNER:

11
12

Are there some

Oh, yes, there are, Your

Honor.
*

13

QUESTION:

Is -- is one of those instances so

14

that dealers have the ability to switch to different

15

manufacturers, different suppliers?

16

MR. BAUMGARTNER:

Well, the dealer, until he's

17

committed to a particular supplier or manufacturer, always

18

has the ability to switch suppliers.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

And -- and is that -- is that ability

helpful to competition, do you think?
MR. BAUMGARTNER:

Oh, yes, I think it is.

induces a competition between wholesalers or

23

manufacturers.

QUESTION:

Do you suggest that that case,

Sylvania, totally rejected any interest in the

It

independence of the dealer, such as, for example, fixing

2

minimum prices?

3

case?

4

Do you think that's at stake in this

MR. BAUMGARTNER:

I don't believe that minimum

5

price fixing is at stake in this case, Your Honor.

As I

6

understand Sylvania, Sylvania represents a switch from

7

Albrecht in the sense of looking not at -- in Albrecht the

8

Court, I believe, looked at possible misuses of the

9

activity in question.

And in Sylvania, the Court, rather

10

than looking at possible misuses, looked to see whether

11

the activity had potential pro-competitive effects.

12

My problem with the question of minimum

13

price-fixing is that I'm not really in a -- a position to

14

express a worthwhile opinion on the pro-competitive

15

aspects of minimum price-fixing.

16

really expressing any opinion on it at all.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. BAUMGARTNER:

And, therefore, I'm not

It doesn't really apply in this case?
It does not apply.

Our

19

argument is limited strictly to vertical maximum

20

price-fixing.

21

If the primary concern that remains from

22

Albrecht is the question of price agreements as such, it's

23

a recognized fact today that price agreements cannot be

24

realistically lumped into one sole category.

There's an

And we believe that the --

QUESTION:

5

There's a recognized

Not by our

current antitrust jurisprudence.
MR. BAUMGARTNER:

6

Even in the decision in

7

Albrecht, Your Honor, the Court appears to recognize that

8

there is a difference between maximum prices and minimum

9

prices.

10

And that's really all I was expressing as an

opinion.
QUESTION:

11

I think we can all stipulate that

12

there's a difference between maximum prices and minimum

13

prices.

14

legal difference that's -- that's been established in --

15

in some of our cases.

But I thought you were saying that there was a

I know of no legal --

That's not what you're saying,

though?
MR. BAUMGARTNER:

No.

I know of no legal

20

difference between the effect of maximum prices and the

21

effect of minimum prices.

22

realistic economic difference between the two.

sense, as I indicated before, can be used in a

to be, per se, as a matter of law, unreasonable and

forbidden.

3

QUESTION:

Pro -- pro-competitive because it

4

precludes exploitation of -- of exclusive territories.

5

there any other particular reason that it's

6

pro-competitive?

7
8

MR. BAUMGARTNER:

Yes.

Is

I believe that the --

the most significant position in which it's
pro-competitive is the situation -- and we believe that

10

situation existed in this case -- in which a supplier, in

11

this particular case, to assist the dealers' competitive

12

position, provides a reduced wholesale price -- not in one

13

specific instance, such as a -- a price war or anything

14

like that, but, generally speaking -- prices the dealer

15

below what the dealer would normally be charged as a

16

wholesale price.

17

discouraged from doing that because he's unable to obtain

18

any sort of binding assurance that the dealer won't pass

1

that reduction -- or will pass that reduction on and won't

20

simply regard it as money on the table which he can then

21

use.

22

And we believe that the supplier is

And I think that's probably a more important and

23

more significant instance than the situation in which the

24

dealer has a monopoly position.

I mean,

1

it's surely not enough for you to say that there's -- you

can conceive of circumstances in which vertical maximum

price restraints are -- are healthy.

4

could conceive of instances in which -- in which vertical

circumstances, but the chances are -- are so small that

It might be helpful in some

And you

10

should put the burden on the other side, to show that

11

there's some exceptional situation.

12

MR. BAUMGARTNER:

13

QUESTION:

I --

So you -- can you persuade us that

14

that's the case, that it's more -- it's more likely to be

15

good than bad?

16

MR. BAUMGARTNER:

I believe I can, Your Honor.

17

I've given two instances, counting the -- the one that was

18

given, three instances, in which it's a good situation.

1

On the other hand, I personally -- and it may be

20

a defect in my imagination -- but I personally am unable

21

to come up with any situation in which a vertical maximum

22

price arrangement can be used in a manner which will

23

reduce competition.

opponent here claims that one situation is where -- where

the -- the maximum price on -- on one line, high octane

gas, prevents him from charging a lower price on another

line.

4

gather it, what -- what Khan wanted to do was to use --

5

use the low octane as a -- as a loss leader, and make up

6

for the difference by charging a lot on high octane.

7

Why -- conceivably, that could benefit consumers.

8

there are more consumers that buy low octane than high

9

octane.

Why isn't that a situation?

Actually, there was no evidence of that
It's simply a claim at this

But I would alter that situation, if I could,

16

Your Honor, to the situation in which we are merely

17

selling high octane gasoline, and he wishes to use our

18

product to subsidize a loss leader of some other type.

19

Mr. Khan's operation, he carried a lot of different

20

products -- bread, milk -- a number of things.

21

think we would have a very legitimate objection, and

22

should have a right to protect ourselves, if Mr. Khan had

23

increased the price of all gasoline, for instance, to

24

subsidize a price reduction for beer.

1

of Albrecht.

That's going to hurt our antitrust

2

enforcement.

Now, would you like to comment on the

3

position of the States?

4

MR. KLEIN:

I'd be -- I'd be delighted to.

5

I think there are two things I'd like to say about it.

6

First of all, what's significant is that the States

7

themselves don't cite a single instance, and we in the

8

Federal Government could find no instances, where an

9

enforcement agency brought a maximum case.

I --

And that seems

10

to me to be very, very telling.

That is, in the 30 years

11

since Albrecht, none of them appear to have brought such a

12

case.
Second, their concern -- if you read their

13
14

briefs -- their concern is, somehow, if you breach the

15

wall in this pricing area, that you won't be able to stop

16

at minimum.

17

effects.

18

could be a minimum.

19

Now, I think minimum presents very different

And in fact, their key argument is that maximum

But my answer to that is, if it is a minimum, it

20

will be treated by a minimum.

And, frankly, I don't see

21

any problem in detection.

22

could disguise this -- after all, the first person who is

23

likely to object is going to be the dealer.

24

dealer thinks that its price wants -- he wants to drive

25

his price down, he's entirely free to do so.

The notion that somehow you

15

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

And if the

And if he

1

gets punished for that, then we know that it's a minimum.
So this notion that it's undetectable seems to

2

3

me to be a very hard one to sustain.

4

Now, in addition, the only other arguments of

5

maximum and minimum, which I think is the most telling

6

thing about the States' brief, Justice O'Connor, is they

7

really are fighting for another day.

8

should come, entirely different competitive considerations

9

will be at play.

And if that day

But the other thing that's very telling about

10
11

it, the only other argument you see in the briefs is that

12

a maximum price could affect dealer service.

13

that -- that's a reasonable concern, but I would say

14

several things about it.

15

Now, that --

One, there's no reason to think that the

16

manufacturer is not interested in dealer service that has

17

a pro-competitive benefit.

18

it recognized in Sharp, that manufacturers have an

19

interest in order to maximize their profit in an efficient

20

distribution system.

21

is that under the law now, after GTE/Sylvania, you can

22

actually impose specific service limitations in your

23

contract.

24
25

This Court recognized, in GTE,

Second, and it seems to me crucial,

dealers:

The Court's opinion, quite clearly, eroded that

MS. HARBOUR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

15

For several decades, the 35 State attorneys

16

general before this Court today have been the primary

17

enforcers of the law in the area of vertical price-fixing.

18

Our experience, and the realities of the marketplace, have

19

shown us that the labels placed on these agreements --

20

that is to say, maximum vertical price-fixing, on one

21

hand, and minimum vertical price-fixing on the other --

22

are, in most cases, a meaningless distinction.

23

As the agencies most familiar with these cases,

24

the States have considerable experience with price-raising

25

schemes being characterized as price-lowering schemes.

The -- the reason that I think that's

awfully important is because what you're basically doing

is you're taking the position that consumers should have

19

to pay more money for gasoline.

20

consumers to pay more money for gasoline, there ought to

21

be -- which is what's going on, if you don't let them set

22

a real high price -- then I'd like to know why.

23

argument is, because, really, maybe it's a minimum price.

24

All right, I understand that argument.

sound.

Now, if you're requiring

But what is the evidence that you have to make

2

consumers pay more money for gasoline in order to stop

3

people from, you know, charging a minimum price?

4

and -- and that's why I think this evidentiary question,

5

why you know that, why you're saying this, the facts of

6

the case, are pretty important.

7

to -- you know, why do you think that?

8

9

MS. HARBOUR:

And --

So -- so I'm urging you

Your Honor, basically, the

argument being advanced today by the Petitioners is that

10

manufacturers, like State Oil, should be free to restrain

11

the exercise of monopoly power by their dealers who have

12

been granted exclusive territories.

13

Khan had no exclusive territory.

14

record that points to that.

15
16
17

Well, first of all,

There is nothing in this

And, second of all, nothing in this record
suggests that Khan had monopoly power whatsoever.
QUESTION:

That's quite a good point.

And --

18

and do you think, then, it would be possible, under a rule

19

of reason, for a firm to come and complain on the basis

20

that they're a failing dealer, and so a failing dealer

21

couldn't possibly be in a situation of trying to raise

22

prices above the competitive level unless there was no

23

need for this kind of thing to constrain his price?

24

mean, that's what I think would be quite interesting,

25

whether there would be categories of things where it would

I

1

be a good defense -- or it would be a good -- a good

2

price-fixing claim.

3

MS. HARBOUR:

The rule of reason is not the rule

4

for a price-fixing case or any agreement on price.

In

5

fact, as this Court has held in Maricopa, the

6

anti-competitive potential inherent in all price-fixing

7

cases justify their facial invalidation even when

8

pro-competitive justifications are offered for some.

9

in this case, Your Honor, it is the States' position that

10

the argument posited by the Petitioners is illogical.

11

allow me to illustrate.

12

But,

And

The Petitioners have hypothesized a dealer with

13

market power in an exclusive territory.

When a dealer has

14

monopoly power, by definition, there is no effective

15

interbrand competition; and, therefore, there is no

16

justification for granting the exclusive territory.

17

the Sylvania decision, Sylvania held that restraints on

18

intrabrand competition -- namely, the exclusive

19

territory -- will only be tolerated when they stimulate

20

interbrand competition.

Under

21

But here, this -- this dealer, this hypothetical

22

monopoly power that this dealer has, there is no effective

23

interbrand competition.

24

justification for granting the exclusive territory; and

further, there is no justification for imposing the price

mischaracterized that, forgive me.

that, in Sylvania, this Court said that in order to -- to

3

restrain intrabrand competition, there must be effective

4

interbrand competition.

5

that has been posited here.

6

But I -- I do know

And the States do not feel that

But we do believe that a great deal is at stake

in this case, Your Honor -- more than the 29-year-old rule

in the Albrecht decision.

9

per se rule against maximum price-fixing, which has served

The clear and straightforward

10

this Nation well for most of this century, is at risk.

11

Albrecht was merely a reaffirmation of Dr. Miles,

12

Sucony-Vacuum Oil, Parke Davis and many other precedents

13

in a consistent line of cases, which all stand for the

14

same proposition -- that price-fixing is price-fixing,

15

whether it is vertical or horizontal --

16

QUESTION:

Then why was it -- Dr. Miles was 1911

17

and Albrecht wasn't until the sixties.

18

evident that minimum and maximum are the same and they're

19

all equally bad, why did it take from 1911, till what,

20

1968 for that light to go on?

21

MS. HARBOUR:

So if it was so

Actually, it didn't, Your Honor.

22

In 1911, Dr. Miles equated horizontal and -- and vertical

23

price-fixing.

24

produced market effects that were functionally the same.

25

But, then, in the Sucony-Vacuum Oil decision, in 1940,

And -- and, basically, they said that it

this Court formulated the classic definition of a

2

price-fixing agreement -- any agreement that fixes,

3

raises, lowers, maintains, or stabilizes prices.

4

agreement, maximum and minimum price-fixing was equated.

QUESTION:

In that

Well, that may be, but they're

6

arguing for a very basic distinction.

7

context, the one, means the consumer pays low prices; in

8

the other, high prices.

9

prices, that's likely to be bad.

10
11

In the vertical

Where the consumer pays high
Where it means the

consumer pays lower prices, that's likely to be good.
I mean, that's a crude distinction, and it

12

requires lots of -- but, I mean, I think that's the basic

13

idea, isn't it, for making the distinction between the

14

high and the low, under the antitrust laws?

15

MS. HARBOUR:

Yes.

In the States' opinion,

16

price ceilings almost always harm consumers.

17

almost always harm consumers because they can disguise a

18

minimum price, as this Court pointed out in Albrecht and

19

late in Maricopa, or they could be a de facto minimum.

20

And also they can fa -- facilitate collusion.

I believe that that suggestion by

Your Honor is an alternative that can be used instead of
