ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. SUTTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents a straightforward question of

12

statutory construction.

13

U.S.C. 1395ww(h)(2)(A), which is quoted on page 19 of

petitioner's opening brief.

1

and there was already a longstanding process in place for

2

determining the amount recognized as reasonable for each

3

year, including 1984.

4

QUESTION:

Well, determine I think could quite

5

reasonably be read to mean, use some discretion, or

6

judgment.

7

calculate they would have said calculate.

I mean, it seems to me if they just meant

8

9

MR. SUTTER:

Well, I think when you're referring

to an average, determine and calculate are essentially

10

equivalent, and there are, Mr. Chief Justice, within

11

1395ww(h) other provisions where it's clear that Congress

12

did intend to confer significant authority on the

13

Secretary.

14

One such provision is 1395ww(h)(2)(E), which is

15

on page 3 of petitioner's appendix.

16

here, but there it says, in the case of a hospital that

17

did not have an approved medical residency training

18

program, ellipses, during fiscal year 1984, the Secretary

19

shall, ellipses, provide for such approved FTE resident

20

amount as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.

21

I will use ellipses

Now, this is language that does clearly grant

22

the secretary discretion.

Here we have activist language.

23

In (a), the provision we're dealing at -- with, the

24

Congress was telling the Secretary, divide A by B, divide

25

one number by another.

There is also, if --

QUESTION:

Mr. Sutter --

3

QUESTION:

The problem I have with this

4

provision is what it is that the word recognized modifies.

5

You win, it seems to me, if it is to be read, that the

6

average amount recognized as -- recognized as reasonable

under this subchapter.

10

Does under this subchapter go with

If it does, I think your case is

But it could also be read, the average amount

You

12

understand what I'm saying?

13

obviously refers to a 19 -- to a prior determination.

If it has to have been

reasonable under this subchapter, so that the

21

prepositional phrase, under this subchapter, goes with

Now, why is it that I should read it the first
way rather than the second?
MR. SUTTER:

Well, there are a number of

1

reasons, but one is that there is one, and only one

2

statutory provision in the medicare subchapter that does

3

provide for recognizing an amount as reasonable, and that

4

is 42 U.S.C. 1395oo(a), which we have quoted at pages 11

5

and 12 of petitioner's appendix.

6

The relevant language is at the top of page 12,

7

which refers to a final determination, which we know as

8

the notice of program reimbursement for the NPR, as to the

9

amount of total program reimbursement due the provider for

10

the items and services for which payment may be made under

11

this subchapter for the period covered by such report.

12

The words that are used in the GME statute is,

13

amount recognized as reasonable under this subchapter.

14

Here in 1395oo(a) we have a specific amount, it is

15

recognized as reasonable -- that is, there's a final

16

determination of program reimbursement -- it is

17

specifically under this subchapter, and it's specifically

18

for a period.

19

This is a very important provision in the

20

medicare subchapter, and in fact is one that this Court

21

has seen before in the Bethesda Hospital Association case

22

decided in 1988.

23

QUESTION:

Well, that -- I mean, that's all very

24

persuasive if you read the phrase as recognized under this

25

subchapter.

I think you point out quite correctly to that

1

provision.

2

it's talking about something that has been recognized

3

under this subchapter.

4

That's the only provision it could refer to if

But if it's just talking about something that

5

has been recognized as reasonable, or that will in the

6

future be recognized as reasonable, then it could refer to

7

a new determination and not one that has already been

8

made.

9

MR. SUTTER:

Well, I do -- I think the timing

10

here would preclude that, because COBRA 9202(e), which we

11

have cited at page 6 of our reply brief, clearly reflects

12

that Congress intended these amounts to be established by

13

1987.

14

in all cases.

15

wanted to have two amounts.

That was well within the reopening period for 1984

16

There's no reason why Congress would have

QUESTION:

Well, there's no reason it would want

17

two amounts, but there is a reason that it might want a

18

corrected amount, and suddenly a figure which in the past

19

has been used solely to calculate a reimbursement for 1

20

year is going to be the basis for reimbursement in effect

21

in perpetuity until the law gets changed, so I mean,

22

there's a -- there would be a good reason on Congress'

23

part to want to make sure that the ultimate figure was the

24

right one.

25

MR. SUTTER:

Oh, I agree with you.

They would.

1

QUESTION:

So we're not talking -- I mean, it's

2

not as though -- but I guess my only point is, I don't see

3

that you get anywhere by saying Congress wouldn't have

4

wanted two figures.

5

wants the right figure.

6

7

MR. SUTTER:

And I think there's every reason to

believe that we do have the right figure here.
QUESTION:

8

9

Congress wants one figure and it

Let me ask you this.

We have --

Going back to

Justice Scalia's question, on your reading, what is served

10

by having the modifier, as reasonable, in there at all,

11

because on your reading once the figure has been

12

recognized, that's it for all purposes, including future

13

calculation.

14

MR. SUTTER:

I think that avoids a potential

15

question as to whether the lower cost or charges principle

16

applies.

Under reasonable cost standards --

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. SUTTER:

19

QUESTION:

But -- may I interrupt you here?
Sure.
In any given -- in the case of any

20

given hospital for the base year there has been, at least

21

in the past with respect to that year, that annual

22

reimbursement, only one figure recognized, isn't that so?

23

In other words, the Secretary didn't say, well, we'll

24

reimburse you either the A amount or the B amount,

25

depending on methodology.

MR. SUTTER:

2

figure recognized as reasonable, but in certain cases that

3

may not have been what was actually paid and the reason

4

why is that, under 42 U.S.C. 1395f(b), a hospital got paid

5

the lower of its reasonable cost or its customary charges.
Now, in almost all cases the reasonable costs

6
7

would be lower, but there could be cases where the

8

customary charges were lower, and to avoid any ambiguity

9

the words, as reasonable make clear that you're looking at

10

the amount that was recognized as reasonable -QUESTION:

11

Ifer

Well, there has been only one

Is that your interpretation of it, or

12

is there any basis for saying that what Congress had in

13

mind was that sometimes the hospital might charge even

14

less than what was reasonable?

15

MR. SUTTER:

16

That's 42 U.S.C. 1395f(b).

MR. SUTTER:

MR. SUTTER:

QUESTION:

24

But you're giving that as a reason -Right.
-- for why the word reasonable is in

there.

21

23

Well, that's in the statute.

Right.
And my question to you was, is that

just your interpretation?
MR. SUTTER:

That's my interpretation.

why I think it's important to have the words, as

That's

reasonable.

2

QUESTION:

Do I understand you right that you

3

wouldn't be having any claim here if the Secretary had

4

made the reopening period 5 or 6 years instead of 3 years?

5

Is that right?

6

MR. SUTTER:

Well,

I think in this case,

in

7

light of COBRA 9202(e) ,

8

the per-resident amount to be established by 1987, which

9

was well within the existing reopening period,

it is clear that Congress intended

just as in the

and I think

Suppose from the start the

I want the reopening period to be 6

MR. SUTTER:

You mean that was a general period

for all years?
QUESTION:

Just the same regulation as the

19

Secretary now has, except instead of saying 3,

20

Then do I understand that you wouldn't have any claim?

21

MR. SUTTER:

it says 6.

Well, as we pointed out in footnote

22

8 of our reply brief, the current reopening regulation is

23

a pretty broad construction of the statute, but you would

24

certainly have a very different case here.

25

Our case is based upon the fact that there was

1

an amount recognized as reasonable under this subchapter,

2

and the Secretary is not using that amount.

3

QUESTION:

Yes, I understand that argument, but

4

I just wanted to be clear on two things.

5

Secretary made a longer period you wouldn't be contesting

6

that the amount that the Secretary ultimately arrived at

7

is an amount that is reasonable.

8

9

MR. SUTTER:

We would -- yes.

One, if the

We would say

there needs to be uniformity, and whatever's the final

10

determination for

11

used for purposes of this average, that's correct.

12

984, that is the amount that would be

QUESTION:

Just following up on Justice

3

Ginsburg's question, you would agree the agency could have

4

repealed the 3-year window for examining the costs if it

5

had chosen to do so by regulation?

6

MR. SUTTER:

Well, I don't think so in this case

7

because of COBRA 9202(e).

That clearly reflected

8

Congress' intent that this would be established by

9

and in any event --

20

QUESTION:

987,

So the statute froze into place the

21

congressional -- pardon me, the administrative regulations

22

on re-audit?

23

MR. SUTTER:

If it expected to be done by

987,

24

which Congress made clear that it did, I think it would --

25

it did that, yes.

I mean, this is a rate system.

1

It's not a

2

retrospective payment system like reasonable cost, and one

3

of the important things for a rate is that they be set in

4

advance so that everyone knows what the rate's going to be

5

and so that you have predictability.

6

QUESTION:

May I ask you a question about one of

7

the phrases that troubles me?

8

follow, but you quoted to us from sections oo and so

9

forth.

It's a hard statute to

They were in the statute before 1986, I believe.

10

MR. SUTTER:

11

QUESTION:

Yes, that's correct.
And therefore the duty to make a

12

determination existed before the 1986 amendment.

13

therefore, the word in the 1986 amendment that seems

14

interesting to me is the Secretary shall determine.

15

MR. SUTTER:

16

QUESTION:

17

Now,

Right.
In 1986 it imposed a new duty to make

a determination that did not previously exist.

18

MR. SUTTER:

19

QUESTION:

Determine the average.
Which sounds to me as though they may

20

have said you're not necessarily bound by what you would

21

have done under the preexisting statute.

22

MR. SUTTER:

Well, it said you shall determine

23

the average, and the amount recognized.

24

course the amount recognized for '84 will be done before

25

you actually determine the average, just because '84

In petitioner's case, the first year was '86,

8

MR. SUTTER:

9

QUESTION:

10

Well, the old determination didn't do

No, no.

It is a -

The '84 determination just gave you

the total figure.

11

MR. SUTTER:

12

QUESTION:

That's correct.
And what this says is, you figure how

13

much of that is attributable to each full-time equivalent

14

resident.

15

MR. SUTTER:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. SUTTER:

No, it's the average -Yes.
-- for each resident, but what you

18

would have, when you have the NPR you would have with it

19

an audited cost report that would give you an aggregate

20

figure for GME.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. SUTTER:

Right.
So you would take that figure,

23

whatever it is, and divide it by your number of

residents --

Right.

-- and that's what you'd get as

your number.

3

QUESTION:

But it's interesting that the term

4

which we're considering is not the amount recognized as

reasonable for each full-time -- each FTE.

6

average amount recognized as reasonable, and the so-called

7

average amount has never been recognized.

MR. SUTTER:

10

It's the

That is a

Yes, that's correct, so the

Secretary shall determine the average, that's right.
QUESTION:

11

Well, shall determine the average

12

amount, and that so-called average amount has never been

13

determined in the past.
MR. SUTTER:

14

No, but the amount recognized as

15

reasonable under this subchapter is always determined

16

as -- in the normal course, and the language here is very

17

similar to the same language that we had in the

18

prospective payment system for operating costs in -- for

19

TEFRA.

20

QUESTION:

Well, except that it didn't have the

21

modifier average on there.

different figure.

23

out earlier, it was talking about the numerator.

24
25

It was talking about a

It was talking -- as you have pointed

MR. SUTTER:

But the Secretary was directed to

compute the average.

1

QUESTION:

Yes.

2

MR. SUTTER:

Because you see that there's an

3

average if you look at 42 U.S.C. 1395ww(a)(4), which

4

defines all of that in terms of average.

5

So the term that you're looking at, and looking

6

at what the target amount is, doesn't use the word

7

average, but it keys into an average when you look at

8

(a)(4), which requires that it's an average amount, in

9

that case per discharge, and in this case it's per

10

resident.
QUESTION:

11

Mr. Sutter, I hope at some point you

12

will tell us -- because this has to affect the way you

13

look at this case.

14

what the '84 figure would show and what the recalculation

15

shows.

There's an enormous variation between

16

MR. SUTTER:

17

QUESTION:

Right.
And it gives me, at least, the

18

impression that it's a pretty terrible system that would

19

carry forward such an enormous error, and if there's a way

20

to avoid that, I would like to.

21

MR. SUTTER:

Okay.

Well, essentially what

22

happened in this case is, a great portion of that is

23

attributable to the time that the physicians reported as

24

administrative time.

25

time studies, and one of the categories was for

That is, during '84 they completed

administrative time that was always claimed and always

2

allowed as GME.

3

In the re-audit the intermediary applied a

4

default rule and said, well, your administrative time

5

could have been administrative time for GME, or it could

6

have been administrative time for operating purposes.

7

must look --we must see actual data from '84, or we're

8

just going to apply an ad hoc default rule, and that's

9

what occurred in this case.

We

That -- either directly or indirectly, that
accounts for about 90 percent of the differential here.
QUESTION:

And your claim is that had that

13

been -- had that method of calculation been imposed in

14

1984 you would have had the facts and figures that would

15

have allocated more of that administrative time to GME.

16

MR. SUTTER:

I believe that to be the case.

17

would also say that during '84 itself no breakdown was

18

required, and --

19

QUESTION:

Well, what factual development in the

20

record is there to show that you were hurt by this so-

21

called default rule, that you didn't have material that

22

you had at one time but had disposed of?

MR. SUTTER:

Well, we -- in the record we

have -- there is the audit adjustment report which shows

1

Because a large part of your brief,

examined it, was that hospitals have thrown away their

records for 1984 and they're prejudiced, but that seems to

it because -- is the reason, is one reason you're not

16

focusing on it -- one reason because you conceded it out

17

of the case, and I take it the other reason is because

18

they've actually promulgated a rule that states, as an

19

equitable solution to the problem of the nonexistence of

20

records, we are allowing providers to furnish

21

documentation from cost reporting periods subsequent to

22

the base period.

MR. SUTTER:

What's the answer?

There's two answers.

First of all,

even where that applies, it's not fair, and secondly it
doesn't apply here.

Let me go to the first.

They allow a 3-week current time study for 1990,

You get the

You get what was in the 80 -- 1984

NPR, or you get the figure in the time study.
It's also a figure for 1990, which is unrelated
to what we're looking for, which is what was recognized
for 1984.

It was not available to the hospital here

because this hospital did have time records from 1984, or
it had summaries.

The problem wasn't the time records, it

was -- the problem was that they were reinterpreted by the
Secretary.

1

But I also have a later sentence in

this same thing which, it says, we understand that all

this stuff is at best persuasive, so if the intermediary

That's how I read it.

they will look at it, and they'll deal with it
appropriately, and I looked at that, and I saw that you

yourselves had given up any challenge to the question --

It would have been

I think if they had proceeded, that they may

very well -- I think, in fact, they probably would have

20

won, because really the issue they had here is, I think,

21

the same as an issue in another case called Good Samaritan

23

involved this administrative time, and that that ruled

against the Secretary and the Secretary did not appeal.

matter, which is, did the Secretary have the authority to

that really ends the matter.

As far as -- I don't see that it's necessary to

apply any presumption here, but if there is a presumption

that is to be applied, I would suggest the presumption is

Isn't there some difference between a

regulation which perhaps deals with private actors in

17

I mean, don't we give more latitude to

MR. SUTTER:

Well, perhaps, but I think we have

18

clear language here, and I think we also have the fact

19

that there was already a final and binding determination,

20

and there is a presumption in favor of issue preclusion,

21

and there's nothing to overcome that presumption here.

But up until the change that was made

to take this as a base year, final and binding meant, we

binding for purposes of that year, once a 3-year reopening

passes is one thing.

14

To say final and binding forever is something

15

that could come into play only after the '86 act, am I

right, because before then final and binding referred only

It doesn't help because the Secretary's not

It's also not helping in many cases because the

hospitals have to have documentation from 1982, which many

of them no longer have.
QUESTION:

7

Well, they may not have it, but

8

weren't they put on notice by the Secretary that there

would indeed be this recalculation, so can any hospital at

this point claim that they were surprised to find that

11

they would like to look at old records which they tossed

out?
MR. SUTTER:

13

No, they weren't put on notice.

14

The proposed rule indicated that there might be some re-

15

MS. BLATT:

I understand.
And in this case the statute directs

the Secretary to determine an average amount recognized as

reasonable under the act for GME costs per resident.
QUESTION:

12

Why is the word recognized in there?

13

Your colleague had some difficulty explaining the phrase,

as reasonable, but why is the word recognized -- why

15

didn't it just say, the average amount reasonable under

16

this subchapter for direct graduate -- why is the word

17

recognized there?

18

MS. BLATT:

Well, the word recognized under the

19

act, to us the most natural reading of that language is,

20

it's the costs that are regarded by the statute,

21

acknowledged or regarded or deemed by the statute as

allowable, and we think the actual -- actually, two

points.

that Congress thought there might be one amount that would
be determined in the 3-year period for the 1984
reimbursement and still a different amount based on 1984
for this permanent program?

Is it reasonable to think

Congress thought there would be two 1984 determinations,
both of which would be reasonable?
MS. BLATT:

No.

I think what Congress wanted

was the actual -- the payment system to be based on an
accurate amount, and there is only one accurate amount,
and the problem was, when the Secretary promulgated her
regulation, at least proposed in 1988, she realized that
substantial overpayments had been made for this
educational program, and she cited many examples.
The Secretary was also concerned that there had
been inconsistent treatment in the costs, and they had not
been given sufficient scrutiny, and to prevent those
costs, or those errors, rather, from being perpetuated
into all future reimbursements, she felt it was
important -- I guess it was he at the time -- to -QUESTION:

Well, I'm not questioning the

reasonableness of her judgment and all that.

I'm just

trying to sit -- if I'm sitting in Congress in 1986, what
did I expect to happen under this language?

her to make two different determinations of reasonableness
for 1984 for this particular hospital.

It's clear that Congress wanted

I just don't think the -- neither the

could amend her regulations, and that's what she did here.

Ms. Blatt, would you help me out on

works, and now I'm not so sure I do.

I thought I understood how the 3-year period

17

I thought that at the end of the -- whatever the

fiscal year is involved here, the hospital in effect would

19

submit the equivalent of a bill with whatever supporting

20

documents it has to submit, and the bill would either get

paid or they would fight it out then and there, but that

QUESTION:

All right.

Now, the reason I -- the

15

reason the question interests me goes back to Justice

16

Stevens' question.

17

If that's the way it works, at the time this

18

statute was passed, would it not normally have been the

19

case that all hospitals would at least have been paid in

20

the first instance and, as an implication of that, their

21

back-up, their figures, their costs would have been

22

recognized in the first instance as reasonable, but they

23

would, nonetheless, have been subject to a re-audit within

24

3 years.

think a more persuasive reading of the word recognized is

Congress could have easily have said, come up

with an amount previously reimbursed, or previously

stop her, on your reading, from saying, yes, I came up

with a lower figure in '90 or '91, but I could get it down

MS. BLATT:

responses.

addresses this, but it might well be irrational or

arbitrary if the Secretary subjected hospitals to

First of all, we don't think the statute

There would also have to be an

I mean, what the Secretary did here is said we

want to make a one-time -- clear-the-slate, one-time

determination of this average-per-resident amount, and she

promulgated a rule to do that.

why the Secretary would do it again, maybe if there was

fraud, and then she wouldn't even need to promulgate a

regulation.

It said, as indicated.

So that was clear

10

certainly this case doesn't involve an as-applied

11

challenge where a hospital has presented evidence that it

discarded records, and on that -- that's on that issue,

13

although petitioner has said there's -- that the hospital

14

was prejudiced.

15

The petitioner did challenge this re-audit for 3

years, but then withdrew all of its challenges in 1994,

18

And moreover, the -- it wasn't a default rule

difference, and the reason that was so significant was,

most of this did result from the fact that petitioner had

Do you have any response to the point, which seems to me a

fairly substantial one, made by the petitioner that in the

same legislation that enacted this provision Congress

15

instructed the Secretary to report back by December 31,

1987 on whether there should be any revisions to provide

17

greater uniformity in the approved FTE resident amounts?

Now, how could she possibly have done that by

December 31, 1987, unless everything -- unless she had

made these determinations by 1987?

that could have been done under this reporting

But this statute is a reporting requirement, and

there were several reporting requirements imposed on the

Secretary in this very bill, but even if you read this

reporting requirement as a mandate for the Secretary to do

in a congressional intent that the Secretary lacks the
