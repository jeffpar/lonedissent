ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD J. ROTHBAUM

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

11
12

MR. ROTHBAUM:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The double jeopardy claims case before the Court

13

today had its genesis in some bank loans in the mid-

14

1980's in several small Oklahoma banks controlled by the

15

petitioners.

16

examiners as collectively violating insider lending

17

regulations.

18

These loans were challenged by Federal bank

As a result, in 1989 the Comptroller of the

19

Currency proposed to impose civil penalties on petitioner,

20

two types petitioners -- that's two types.

21

lifetime bar from the business of banking or at any

22

federally insured institution, subject to the right to

23

reapply at a later time in writing.

QUESTION:

First, a

any federally insured institution.

Would that have

applied to a bank which was not federally insured?
MR. ROTHBAUM:

Your Honor, it applies to -- it

3

actually -- the State banking system through the FDIC

4

insurance system, or through the national banks through

5

the Comptroller's regulatory authority, and it would have

6

to be with the permission of both agencies before they

7

could return.

8

9

In addition to which, the Comptroller proposed
civil penalties of $100,000 against Mr. Hudson and $50,000

10

each against the other two petitioners, Messrs. Baresel

11

and Rackley.

12

Now, these sentences were imposed pursuant to a

13

statutory scheme that, unlike some, for these sections --

14

for these section required timing rules that there be

15

willful acts and the Administrator then considered whether

16

it is repetitive, whether there is concealment, questions

17

of bad faith and so forth.

18

With regard to that scheme those findings were

19

met here, remain here and are in the record.

20

do not contain any authority for the administrative

21

agencies to consider matters such as internal

22

investigatory costs, expenses incurred in investigating

23

the bankers, or other similar matters, nor did the

24

Government contend at any time that it had suffered

25

quantifiable monetary loss for which this sanctions, these

The statutes

OC -- did OCC ever take such a position. In 1992, the

3

petitioners were indicted for the same 18 loans, the only-

4

difference being that there is one conspiracy count in the

5

indictment.

6

Comptroller purported to find that these were acts done by

7

the petitioners together, and that the statutes under

8

which he imposed his sanctions allowed that to be

9

considered in the penalty.

However, it is important to note that the

13

for violating certain statutes, and you were penalized for

14

violating certain rules, and the Government argues the

15

Blockburger test is not met in this case, and you say the

16

Blockburger test doesn't apply, as I understand.

17
18

You say they were indicted for the

Now, of course, they were actually indicted

If the Blockburger test did apply, is it not
clear that it's not satisfied?

19

MR. ROTHBAUM:

Your Honor, if the Blockburger

20

test applies, then it applies at the level of generality

21

that the Government seeks.
QUESTION:

22

Well, it's a simple test.

One

23

statute requires an element, the other does not, and vice

24

versa.

25

MR. ROTHBAUM:

Well, but Your Honor -5

QUESTION:

You don't meet that test here, do

you?
MR. ROTHBAUM:

I suppose, stated that

abstractly, we might not, but our views on that point is

twofold.

First, the Court has never applied that type of

QUESTION:

Right.

MR. ROTHBAUM:

-- proceeding, and the use of

10

the language same transaction repeatedly appears to me not

11

to be an accident, because particularly if you look at

12

the - -

13

QUESTION:

So even acknowledging that we've

14

never done it expressly in this -- because we don't have

15

very many of these cases, is there any reason why that

16

test should not be applied, because even if you say same

17

transaction, you have to in some way define exactly what

18

it is the transaction gave rise to the two different

19

punishments.

20

Blockburger?

21

Why doesn't it make sense just to apply

MR. ROTHBAUM:

I think it makes sense to say,

22

when we're talking about introducing punishment upon a

23

particular individual for allegedly getting involved with

24

an insider loan transaction, that the same insider loan

25

transaction should not be punished twice in separate

1

proceedings, and to that extent, the cases upon which the

2

Court relied in LaFranca, Justice Miller's opinion on

3

circuit in the McKee case, and the opinion of the Southern

4

District of New York in the Gates case support that view,

5

and I think clearly those two cases and probably Halper

6

itself can come out differently under a strict Blockburger

7

analysis, so I do think the Court has taken the position.
QUESTION:

8

If Blockburger is adequate protection

for two criminal prosecutions, then a fortiori ought to be
10

adequate protection for a criminal and a civil

11

prosecution.

What's wrong with that formula?

MR. ROTHBAUM:

12

Your Honor, I suppose my response

13

to that is, Blockburger presupposes this elements

14

analysis, and I'm not sure that always fits.

15

often times it doesn't, where you do not have -- where you

16

have the penalty problem, if you determine your punishment

17

but there's not necessarily a criminal offense associated

18

with it.

1

And I think

For example, last term's decision in the CFI

20

Fabricators case the Court determined there the type of

21

punishment, penalty for failure to pay a tax..

22

That did not mean that there had to be a

23

criminal prosecution or that the criminal process had to

24

be invoked, but I think it has to focus on the realities

25

of the statutory schemes that are at issue, and the

threshold question, is this punishment?
QUESTION:

But double, double jeopardy provision

3

is designed to protect someone from being twice

4

prosecuted, basically.

5

MR. ROTHBAUM:

6

QUESTION:

Or twice punished.

Yes, and what you're doing is, you

7

have had one criminal prosecution, you've had one civil

8

prosecution, and now you're saying, well, we claim that

9

the civil prosecution was actually punitive under Halper,

10

but surely if the double jeopardy provision is designed to

11

prohibit two prosecutions Blockburger should be plenty

12

of -- plenty sufficient to protect the double jeopardy

13

interest, for one of the things is civil.

14

MR. ROTHBAUM:

I agree, Mr. Chief Justice, where

15

there are two criminal prosecutions, but where, as here,

16

the question, the first question is, is there punishment

17

imposed by --

18

QUESTION:

But you have to really squeeze to get

19

the civil thing into double jeopardy at all, because the

20

classic doctrine is that the law doesn't prohibit the

21

imposition of one criminal and one civil penalty.

22

23
24
25

MR. ROTHBAUM:

If it is a civil penalty, if it

is truly civil.
QUESTION:

And that's what Congress said here,

was that it was civil.

MR. ROTHBAUM:

1

Congress said this was a civil

2

penalty, that is how they cast it, but it is our view, it

3

is our submission, that as the Seventh Circuit held in

4

regard to an almost identical worded statute, in the Healy

5

case, that the effect here is necessarily cumulative.
QUESTION:

6

Well, strain to get it -- to make it

7

criminal, in order to get it within the double jeopardy

8

rule, then once there, you strain to get it out through
the Blockburger test.
MR. ROTHBAUM:

10

Your Honor, I'm not -- I would

11

not characterize it as a strain to say that it's criminal.

12

The Court, the Court has not said it was criminal.

13

cases going back as far as Choteau in the 1880s.

14

in the 1 00's, which is cited and quoted in the CFI case,

15

in each of those cases the Court held that the statutory

16

scheme there imposed punishment.

a criminal proceeding.

If it was civil it went to

And let me add another point here with regard to

7

the nature of this proceeding.

8

slightly different than many of the regulatory enforcement

9

actions brought by various Government agencies, because

10

they, many of them rest upon pure negligence, or upon a

11

standard of conduct of less than knowing the rule for

12

misconduct.

13

here, at least under the statute as it was written prior

14

to the 1981 amendments, and if the Court will look on page

15

62, I believe, of the appendix to the petition, the

16

Comptroller's office says.

17

This proceeding is

That is not -- that happens not to be true

Second, these statutes -- this is true from the

18

legislative history that is in our brief, it's true for

19

similar statutes.

20

on the premise that what will happen here, what in fact

21

happened here wouldn't have happened, that what was needed

22

was a lesser penalty so that the criminal process did not

23

have to be invoked.

QUESTION:

25

These statutes have come into existence

Well,

Mr. Rothburger, I -- Rothbaum,

2

this Court's Halper decision in large part.
MR. ROTHBAUM:

Well, Halper is certainly an

3

important decision for our position, I believe because it

4

is the first time that the Court announced categorically

5

that the Constitution's Double Jeopardy Clause could apply

6

in a civil proceeding.

7

QUESTION:

But it certainly said on its face

8

that it was reserved for the rare case, and there was a

9

far greater disparity there in the amounts selected, and

10

the Government's expenses, than would be the case here.

11

I'm not sure that even on its face your petition would

12

meet Halper under any standard, and the second thing I

13

want you to address is that it looks to me like Halper may

14

have been driven in part by due process concerns about

15

vindictive use of civil proceedings following a criminal

16

prosecution.

17
18

Now, here, the civil sanctions were imposed
first, were they not?

19

MR. ROTHBAUM:

20

QUESTION:

Yes, they were, Your Honor.

So there's no danger here of a

21

vindictiveness or a due process sort of concern that may

22

have driven Halper.

23

MR. ROTHBAUM:

24

vindictive prosecution.

25

QUESTION:

That is correct.

No.

So if Halper is limited in that

fashion, as I think it might be, how do you prevail?
MR. ROTHBAUM:

4

Well, Your Honor, as to the first

part of your question, a rare case, this too, is an

6

unusual case.

7

Government will elect to try and claim both severe

administrative sanctions and criminal --

It would be an unusual case where the

MR. ROTHBAUM:

The States are having a

Your Honor, the only point I was

16

making was at least within the Federal system, careful

17

coordination between the SEC and the Justice Department,

18

1940's in the Justice Department, bringing civil and

19

criminal proceedings is the norm today.

20

QUESTION:

Yes, but wasn't the rarity that

21

Halper was talking about a reference to the nature of the

22

civil penalty involved there, and if so, what is the

23

rarity here?

24

MR. ROTHBAUM:

25

perhaps rarity is the wrong word.

Well, it seems to me that the -The distinguishing

1

factor in Halper was that part of the sanction there

2

admitted to be obtained as remedial.
The problem was determining how much more, at

3
4

what point along a continuum did that $2,000 for each

5

false claim penalty become penal, if at all?
QUESTION:

6

Are we still talking about civil

7

preceding criminal, which is how we got into this

8

discussion with a question from Justice O'Connor?
I thought your response for that is that the

9
10

basic claim here is a double jeopardy claim.

11

MR. ROTHBAUM:

12

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And the assertion is that double

13

punishment violates the Double Jeopardy clause, as Halper

14

held, whether it's civil or criminal, and double

15

punishment is double punishment, no matter which one comes

16

first.

17
18

MR. ROTHBAUM:
QUESTION:

19

No matter which one come first.

statement, that the order of the proceedings does not

22

matter.

I say, I believe that is a correct

If, for example, in the case in which there has

24

been a civil punishment imposed, say this is the CFI

25

Federal case, if thereafter on the same facts there had

1

been an attempt to indict, and say, well, the defendant

2

would at least in my judgment have a strong argument, that

3

once this Court had determined this was punishment, that

4

he could not be further punished in a separate proceeding.
QUESTION:

5

Well, some civil penalties aren't

6

punishment, others are, and they're all penalties, and so

7

accepting that it doesn't matter, that the order doesn't

8

matter, accepting that arguendo, what penalties are okay

9

because they're civil, and what civil penalties are not

10

okay because they're really punishment?
How do we -- the books are filled with civil

11
12

penalties.

13

into double jeopardy problems, and the ones that do?

14

mean, what standards would pass muster as a genuine civil

15

penalty, no double jeopardy problem?

16

How do we which ones are okay, don't get us

MR. ROTHBAUM:

I

I think one of the most useful

17

precedents would be the Hicks case, in view of the

18

distinctions between civil and criminal intent, is it a

19

determinate or indeterminate sentence.

20

to take a hypothetical out of the reply brief, if the

21

petitioners had been ordered to make a capital

22

contribution to make up capital impairment and given a

23

specific amount of time to do it, and thereafter, if you

24

didn't, impose a certain fine there will be a strong

25

argument, as I read Justice White's opinion in Hicks, that

If, for example,

14

SUITE 400

(800) FOR DEPO

1

that is an indeterminate and therefore remedial sanction.

2

Another question --

3

QUESTION:

But why should we import from the

4

distinction between civil contempt and criminal contempt,

5

which Hicks dealt with, I think -- why should we import

6

that into this area?

7

MR. ROTHBAUM:

Because I think, in answer to

8

your question, Mr. Chief Justice,it provides a useful

9

standard for answering the question which Justice Ginsburg

10

asked.

And that is, how do you know -- how is one to

11

determine which is which?

12

Another --

13

QUESTION:

When is a penalty not a punishment, a

14

wonderful -- the unsophisticated mind would think that a

15

penalty is always a punishment, wouldn't it?

16

MR. ROTHBAUM:

Your Honor, the unsophisticated

17

mind might, but Congress having chosen to use the word

18

penalty in different contexts, it is simply a fact which

19

exists in the United States Code.

20

Court's cases from Chouteau forward, that cannot affect

21

the fourth principle --

22

QUESTION:

And as I read this

So, but -- it's got to be something

23

more than, like, a day fine that's meant to get you to

24

comply with the law.

25

because you've already not complied, and whatever the

That will never be the case here,

1

penalty is for, it's for past conduct.

2

So you're giving Hicks as an example, where the whole idea

3

is, you got the keys to the kingdom, to the jailhouse in

4

your pocket, comply, and you're home free.

5

It's already done.

Here, you're being penalized for something you

6

did in the past, so that's why I can't get much from

7

Hicks.
MR. ROTHBAUM:

8

9

And we're being penalized for

something we did in the past, after having been told we

10

can no longer participate in the business of banking, it

11

would be different.

12

QUESTION:

Well, I would just like to know what

13

is a civil penalty -- that is, definitely was something

14

you'd done in the past, not to get you to comply, come

15

into compliance with the law, but something that you've

16

done in the past, what kind of penalty -- can there be

17

such a thing as a civil penalty that doesn't get you into

18

double jeopardy problems?

19

MR. ROTHBAUM:

Yes, I think there can.

example, if the Government has suffered -- in the example

21

of a false claim, if the Government has suffered an

BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Civil money penalties serve a vital purpose in

15

Federal regulatory schemes because they serve as an

16

ongoing motivation to regulated parties to conform their

17

conduct to the requirements of the law.

18

our position is that the imposition of civil money

19

penalties in such regulatory schemes does not constitute a

20

bar under the Double Jeopardy Clause to petitioners'

21

subsequent criminal prosecution.

For four reasons,

22

First, civil money penalties in such regulatory

23

schemes, like civil forfeiture actions, do not constitute

24

punishment for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause of

25

the Fifth Amendment.

Second, even assuming that these

Halper?

Well, what do we do with language in

Halper's part of the problem, right?
MR. DREEBEN:

I think, Justice O'Connor, that to

5

a large extent this Court has clarified and limited much

6

of the language in Halper which could be read to lead to

7

very broad results, including results such as petitioners

8

are arguing for today.
One of the most significant features of Halper

10

was its extraordinarily broad definition of punishment as

11

encompassing any sanction that had --

12

13
14

QUESTION:

Yes, that's what I'm talking about.

I mean, that leads to a lot of problems.
MR. DREEBEN:

It leads to a lot of problems

15

because Halper thought, or said that any sanction that

16

couldn't be solely explained without reference to

17

deterrence or retribution must be deemed punishment for

18

double jeopardy purposes.

1

At least twice since that case this Court has

20

retrenched somewhat from Halper's description of

21

punishment in that respect.

22

QUESTION:

May I ask, assuming the language is

23

much too broad in Halper, do you think there was

24

punishment in Halper?

I think not, Justice Stevens.

MR. DREEBEN:

Then the Court's

16

conclusion in that case was that there was punishment, but

17

the Court reached that by a process of analysis that

18

required looking at the fact that it was a fixed penalty,

19

that the penalty was totally disproportionate to the only

legitimate aims of the statute that were not punitive,

opinion, Justice O'Connor. I do think that it was

2

significant to the Court that Halper had been first

3

criminally prosecuted, that the Government then came in

4

and obtained civil penalties --

5

QUESTION:

That's the vindictiveness element.

6

MR. DREEBEN:

I wouldn't be prepared to concede

7

that that was vindictiveness, because there was no showing

8

in that case, and I don't think that the record would bear

9

the conclusion that the Government was motivated to punish

10

Halper for exercise of any of his constitutional rights,

11

which is normally the due process test that would apply in

12

a criminal case.

13

QUESTION:

No, but a dissatisfaction by the

14

Government, we had this criminal prosecution and we didn't

15

get much punishment out of it, now let's go do something

16

about that.

17

We've got this civil remedy here.

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, if that were true, then it

18

would mean that Halper should not be viewed as a double

19

jeopardy case at all, because that analysis I would think

20

would apply even if it were clear that the second case had

21

nothing to do with the elements that were proved in the

22

first case and thus wasn't the same offense under

23

Blockburger.

QUESTION:

1

2

Halper didn't discuss Blockburger for

some reason, in the sense of thinking that applied.
MR. DREEBEN:

3

We didn't raise a Blockburger or

4

same elements issue in Halper because the Civil False

5

Claims Act and the criminal false claims provisions would

6

appear to be satisfied under that test.

7

We brought the case on a direct appeal from a

8

district court decision to this Court, raising only the
question of whether a civil false claims sanction could

10

ever be deemed punishment within the meaning of the Fifth

11

Amendment.

12

could satisfy the Double Jeopardy Clause.

13

We argued then that only criminal punishment

This Court rejected that, and the question is

14

whether the analysis that was used in Halper should carry

15

over to the very different kind of penalties that are at

16

issue in this case.

17

Civil money regulatory penalties aim primarily

18

to shape the conduct of parties who are subject to

1

regulation by sitting as an ever-present reminder that

20

there are consequences for violation of the law, and

21

agencies use them for precisely that purpose, which is

22

appropriately described as a deterrent purpose.

23

Now, under a broad reading of Halper, which I

24

think petitioners have at times embraced, any deterrent

25

purpose would brand these sanctions as punitive for double

1

jeopardy purposes, but this Court has made clear, both in

2

Kurth Ranch and in United States v. Ursery, that even an

3

obvious deterrent purpose does not mean that a civil

4

sanction constitutes punishment and applying an analysis

5

that respected that factor in Ursery, this Court concluded

6

that even though civil forfeiture proceedings are imposed

7

largely to motivate owners of property not to allow their

8

property to be used in violation of the law, that civil
forfeiture should not be deemed punishment for double

10

jeopardy purposes even if it might be deemed punishment

11

under a common sense view, or plain view, or under other

12

constitutional provisions.

13

QUESTION:

Were the penalties in Halper not

14

regulatory under this scheme that you're putting forth,

that they're distinguishable from the kind of penalties

or private, when it has been damaged by fraud, and the

2

Court reached that conclusion by looking at the character

3

of the sanctions that were authorized by the statute:

4

damages, actual damages, double damages, and a fixed

5

penalty which the Court viewed as a way of getting rough

6

compensation for the Government, to include not only its

7

direct losses, but costs of investigation and costs of

8

prosecution.

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, apart from the fact that

10

this definition of punishment would enable the Government

11

to win this case, what is there to be said for it?

12

mean, in the language of the Double Jeopardy Clause, in

13

the common understanding of punishment?

14

just authorized to give punishment whatever definition in

15

the world we want in order to produce results that we sort

of like?

17

MR. DREEBEN:

I

I mean, are we

I think, Justice Scalia, that the

18

starting point is suggested by the fact that the word

19

punishment is not in the Double Jeopardy Clause.

20

QUESTION:

Yes, well, that -- yes, we could

21

start with that, and 48 States have asked us to overrule

22

23

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, there is, I think, an

24

irreducible need to consider the fact that the Double

25

Jeopardy Clause speaks in language that undeniably

connotes a criminal offense.

It speaks of putting

2

somebody in jeopardy of life or limb, and it speaks of an

3

offense, and those are concepts that have primary

4

application, if not exclusive application, to criminal

5

conduct.
Now, we suggest in this case that the

6

7

appropriate test to reconcile the Double Jeopardy Clause

8

and -- with the possibility that civil sanctions may be

9

misused in a way that could implicate that clause, is to

10

apply the test that this Court described in United States

11

v. Ward.

12

civil sanction, and then determine whether there is any

13

evidence, by the clearest proof, that Congress' intent to

14

create a civil sanction should be overridden and that the

15

sanction should be deemed criminal.

16

First determine whether Congress intended a

That is a test that I think is not only

17

responsive to the language of the Double Jeopardy Clause,

18

but reflects the fact that the consequences under double

19

jeopardy are very significant to the Government.

20

In this case, we went in through the OCC and

21

found violations of banking regulations, imposed civil

22

penalties, imposed nonparticipation requirements on the

petitioners through their settlement, and obtained

important results from the point of view of the Office of

QUESTION:

where there is a civil enforcement provision that includes

Justice O'Connor, if one embarks on the enterprise of

QUESTION:

Regardless of the burden.

2

MR. DREEBEN:

Regardless of the burden of proof.

3

That would not be a ground on which we would suggest that

4

these can be distinguished.

5

Now, it is, of course, true, that if we brought,

6

for example, a criminal Federal securities case, and the

7

defendant was acquitted, and we then sought to bring a

8

civil Federal securities case that had the same identical

9

elements, we would not be barred because the defendant

10

would have no multiple punishment argument and the burden

11

of proof is lighter in a civil case, so the criminal

12

conviction -- the criminal acquittal would not constitute

13

any kind of a collateral estoppel bar on the Government

14

proceeding.

15

But that, of course, is not what we have here.

16

What we have here is an agency that, in the course of

17

enforcing its own requirements, and to keep its reins on

18

the regulatory -- regulated parties that are before it,

19

imposes civil penalties to let all regulated parties know

20

that there are consequences for violating the law.

21

QUESTION:

But Mr. Dreeben, going back to the

22

second part of Ward, the criteria that the agency uses

23

sound like traditional sentencing criteria to me, I mean,

24

as set out on page 3 -- wilfulness, insider status,

previous warnings, history of violations, loss, number of

2

that sounds like common law punishment to me.

3

MR. DREEBEN:

I mean,

Well, the criteria, Justice

4

Souter, may not be very different,

5

aimed at determining what level of penalties is

6

appropriate to send a deterrence signal not only to these

individuals but to the world at large, and the Court

has - -

10

QUESTION:

but those criteria are

Yes, but that's exactly what common

law courts do in sentencing.
MR. DREEBEN:

11

That is true, but the Court has

12

recognized that deterrence is a legitimate nonpunitive

13

objective of the civil law.

14

Court said in Ursery, when it looked at civil in rem

15

forfeiture, recognized that one of the main purposes of it

16

was to motivate parties, not to allow their property to be

of sanction is not punishment for double jeopardy

purposes.

MR. DREEBEN:

11

Well, the order of the

12

proceedings, but what I wanted to focus on here is simply

13

that there are radical consequences from deeming a

14

sanction to be covered by the Double Jeopardy Clause.

15

If the Court were to hold, and we would not

16

dispute that these civil fines were sufficiently punitive

17

to implicate the concerns of the Eighth Amendment, what

18

that would mean is that there would be constitutional

19

review of the amount of the fines that were imposed to

20

determine that they were not excessive.
If the Court were to determine that there was

QUESTION:

The Eighth Amendment uses the word

punishment, by the way, which is a great advantage over

MR. DREEBEN:

1

Well, it does in the Cruel and

2

Unusual Punishments Clause, but it does not in the

Excessive Fines Clause, and I think that the Court has

4

incorporated notions of punishment into both of those

clauses to capture in a colloquial way what they are

getting at.

consider the consequence of applying double jeopardy here,

MR. DREEBEN:

Correct.

But what is it?
The test that we're suggesting in

this context is the test articulated in United States v.

Ward.

14

in purpose or effect it is so punitive as to betray that

Justice Ginsburg?
QUESTION:

saying you're not -- you're accepting Halper, Halper's

QUESTION:

What should our standard

be for saying, this is labeled civil penalty, but it gets

into double jeopardy territory because it's punishment,

and we know that for what identifying characteristics?

And so you -- what you started to say now, using

6

Ward, is, when it becomes -- the words were -- are highly

7

generalized, so I would like you to be more concrete.

8

9

MR. DREEBEN:

The most concrete that I can be,

Justice Ginsburg, is to note that first, any civil

10

sanction needs to be considered on its own terms, so that

11

there will be different results for different kinds of

12

civil sanctions, and second, the kind of civil sanction

13

that we're talking about here, it is not the entire class

14

of civil money penalties, it is the class of civil money

15

penalties that are imposed for regulatory purposes, and

16

our submission is that categorically the Court should

17

conclude that if those sanctions are enacted under --

18

imposed under statutes that passed the Ward test, there is

19

not a double jeopardy problem.

20

Now, the Ward test will always be a highly case-

21

specific enterprise for this Court because, to the extent

22

it's been particularized, it looks to the list of factors

23

that the Court articulated in Kennedy v. Martino Mendoza,

24

and those factors, the Court noted even in that case, may

25

point in different directions and they have to be

criminal prosecution occurred first and then the civil

MR. DREEBEN:

And at least as I look at it it

8

seemed to me to have some element in there of a concern by

9

the Court of vindictiveness and disproportionality, if you

will, and due process-type concerns.

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, don't you think it would

be even more vindictive if the Government, having lost an

itself involved a case in which vindictiveness was

2

established.

3

QUESTION:

No.

I'm saying, if you're looking

4

for a situation that displays vindictiveness, it's not the

5

one where the civil precedes -- follows the criminal, it's

6

the one where the civil precedes the criminal and, having

7

lost the civil case, the Government is so enraged it

8

prosecutes the person criminally.

9

MR. DREEBEN:
QUESTION:

10
11
12

We might have a problem --

That seems to be more vindictive, not

less.
MR. DREEBEN:

We might have a problem under

conventional collateral estoppel doctrine if we fail to

14

persuade the fact-finder by a preponderance of the

15

evidence that certain facts were proved, and then we

16

sought to prove to another fact-finder that they were

established beyond a reasonable doubt.

18

There are already conventional protections in

19

the law that would cover cases like that, and I'm not

aware of any case where we did that.

QUESTION:

But you did mention issue preclusion,

1

preclusion --

2

MR. DREEBEN:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. DREEBEN:

That is true.

In the civil case.
That is true, and there are often

5

good reasons to do the criminal prosecution first, not the

6

least of which is that grand jury investigations are

7

surrounded by secrecy, and you want to encourage the grand

8

jury to be able to gather information without interfering

9

with any civil process, and oftentimes grand jury

10

investigations will go forward, the civil case will sit

11

back, and there are also many cases where the Government

12

decides after a criminal conviction is obtained there's no

13

need to proceed with any further proceedings for

14

penalties.

15

But in a case like this, the agency made a

16

perfectly valid judgment that there was an importance to

17

moving promptly to impose the nonparticipation order to

18

protect members of the public from further potential

19

banking violations by these individuals, and to impose the

20

civil penalties so that the rest of the regulated industry

21

was aware that even a regulatory violation has

22

consequences, whether or not down the road somewhere the

23

particular individuals who committed it were so culpable

24

that they should also be subjected to criminal

25

prosecution.

And it would therefore be a fairly dramatic

1

2

consequence for the Government to have to choose an

3

election of remedies at a point where the agency knows

4

that there's a violation, but nobody knows whether there

5

will be sufficient evidence of criminal activity to

6

warrant a grand jury to indict.

7

And in that sense, the order of proceedings not

8

only has a great practical significance, but I think that

9

it also has a constitutional significance.
The submission of the defendants here is that

10
11

the multiple punishments doctrine exists in a fashion that

12

makes a punishment a jeopardy for constitutional purposes.

13

That has never been the traditional way that this Court

14

has analyzed multiple punishments questions even before

15

Halper.

16

The Court has applied the multiple punishments

17

doctrine even when there was indisputably a single

18

jeopardy.

19

punishments doctrine prohibited the imposition of

20

cumulative punishments in one proceeding when the

21

legislature has not authorized it, and in those cases

22

there was clearly only one jeopardy.

23

The Court has held that the multiple

The basic premise of the multiple punishments

24

doctrine was that once an individual has been put in a

25

criminal jeopardy, additional punishment shall not be

1

imposed on that individual for the same crime, and that is

2

not satisfied in a case in which petitioners here have

3

never been criminally indicted and have never been

4

criminally charged.

5

Now, if the Court agrees with us that the Double

6

Jeopardy Clause is categorically not applicable to civil

7

regulatory sanctions unless the defendant is able to make

8

the showing that, despite the civil characterization, the
civil sanctions were in fact criminal under the United

10

States v. Ward test, it doesn't mean that there's no

11

constitutional limit, or no statutory limit to the amount

12

of civil penalties that the Government can impose.

13

There is judicial review that is governed by

14

traditional APA standards of whether a particular civil

15

penalty is within the boundaries that have been set by

16

Congress and that are established by the criteria of the

17

regulatory agency, and there is also review under the

18

Eighth Amendment Excessive Fines Clause to keep the

1

particular civil penalties in question within

20

constitutional bounds.

21

MR. DREEBEN:

2

The statute clearly authorized it,

3

and one of the problems that the Court had in Halper that

4

is not present here is that the statute required the

5

imposition of fixed penalties for every violation

6

regardless of how significant the fraud was to the

7

Government, and that created the potential for hugely

disproportionate civil sanctions being imposed for the
particular fines, the particular violations that were at

issue.

This case -QUESTION:

11

But before you get to the Eighth

12

13

it is a penalty, do you not?

14

MR. DREEBEN:

15

QUESTION:

I don't think so, Justice Kennedy.

In our punitive damages cases and

16

jurisprudence, haven't we said that the Eighth Amendment

17

applies only to a criminal proceeding for excessive fines?

18

MR. DREEBEN:

No.

In fact, the holding of

applies to civil in rem forfeiture, which is clearly a

civil proceeding.

think that a disgorgement remedy or a damages remedy would

would readily concede that the civil penalties that are

MR. DREEBEN:

12

Thank you.

In addition, the Court has said

13

that punitive damages are not paid to the Government

14

directly.

15

The Court reserved the question in the Browning-

16

Ferris case of whether a qui tarn case might be viewed

17

differently because the Government collects part of the

18

money, and I think the Court would likewise reserve

19

punitive damage schemes where the punitive damages were

20

paid in part to the State, but in the conventional case

21

where a private party brings a civil case and collects

punitive damages the Eighth Amendment has nothing to say

about it.

wishes to bring a criminal prosecution first, it may do

15

so, and as a practical matter, whenever there is a belief

16

that -- on the part of the Government that that kind of

very close coordination, reflected, for example, in the

otherwise a great principle would be sacrificed to mere

form, and second, that the mode by which the penalty was

imposed did not matter, whether by a civil action or a

criminal prosecution.

A unanimous Court repeated that holding in La
