ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARSHA S. BERZON

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. BERZON:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The 1980 ERISA amendments set up a complicated,

12

13

complex scheme for assuring the long-run stability of

14

multiemployer plans, pension plans, when employers for

15

many perfectly valid reasons, legal reasons, cease making

16

contributions to the plans.

17

That scheme requires that some but not all

18

withdrawing employers make withdrawal liability payments

19

in amounts that are dictated by the statute under a

20

periodic payment scheme that can extend for as long as 20

21

years, and that is also largely dictated by the statute.
The question before the Court in this case is

22

23

when a cause of action to collect one or more of those

24

unpaid withdrawal liability payments accrues under the

25

1980 act.

The answer to that question in our view is

1

2

rather simple and straightforward, and it depends on two

3

fundamental principles of statute of limitations law.

4

first, and on this point I don't think there's any dispute

5

among the parties, is that ordinarily a limitations period

6

runs from when a cause of action accrues, and in this

7

statute that's made quite explicit by 1451(a), and that

8

means when the plaintiff can first file a lawsuit, not

9

before.

10

The

The statute here so states in 1451(a) that

11

the -- there's a cause of action -- in 1451(f), I'm sorry,

12

that the limitations period runs from when the cause of

13

action arose.

14

The second principle, and here the consensus

15

among the parties I think somewhat collapses, is that a

16

plaintiff's right to file suit ordinarily is triggered by

17

some breach of duty by the potential defendant as defined

18

by the relevant legal rules.

19

Here that's the 1980 act, and the rules that it

20

sets up for determining when the defendant, potential

21

defendant, the employer in this case, is required to make

22

payments, so unless one knows when the employer has

23

breached a legal obligation one really can't make a

24

sensible decision about when the statute of limitations

25

starts to run.

That is, there has to be a situation in which a

1

2

court could issue a corrective order in favor of the

3

plaintiff and against the defendant in order for a cause

4

of action to accrue, so the limitations decision is really

5

the flip side of a set of understandings about what

6

obligations, duties, and rights the statute sets up to

7

begin with and can't be looked at in isolation.
QUESTION:

8

9
10

Does interest run on withdrawal

liability?
MS. BERZON:

Interest runs on withdrawal

11

liability payments, but in an odd way that was described

12

by this Court in Schlitz.

13

been made, once there has been an assessment and a demand

14

and a stated period in which the payments have to be made,

15

then interest runs on payments - -

16

QUESTION:

17

date of withdrawal.

18

MS. BERZON:

That is, once the demand has

So interest would not run from the

It doesn't run from the date of

19

withdrawal, and if the fund does not assess the withdrawal

20

for some period of time it runs only, as described by this

21

court in Schlitz, as if the payment was made on the first

22

day of the date following withdrawal no matter when

23

they're actually made, even if it the demand isn't to make

24

them until sometime later.

25

So to apply these general principles to this

1

case, there are really three factors that are the most

2

important.

3

a violation of any legal obligation, ceasing to make

4

contributions is not the violation of any legal

5

obligation, and that the date of withdrawal is often

6

determined after the fact by a set of events that occur

7

after what is later decided to be the date of withdrawal.

The first is that the withdrawal itself is not

8

So the date of withdrawal is really a datum in a

9

bunch of calculations, and not a date on which an employer

10

is supposed to do anything, and what that means for

11

purposes of the limitations inquiry here is that if the

12

fund had tried to sue the employer on the date of

13

withdrawal they would have been summarily dismissed from

14

their lawsuit because no demand had been made for payment

15

and the employer had no obligation to pay anything.

16

The second critical factor is that the employer

17

does violate the statute once it fails to pay any

18

withdrawal liability payment on the schedule that is set

19

by the fund in the demand letter, again largely prescribed

20

by the statute.

That is the schedule and the amount both.

So what we have here is sort of like a -- any

21
22

bill, like a telephone or a credit card or a legal bill or

23

a

24

incurred regarding facts that occur on a certain date,

25

but until you get a bill that requires you to make a

hospital bill in which there is a liability that is

1

payment there's no obligation to pay, no obligation that

2

has been breached, and no potential lawsuit until that

3

date.

4

And this rule is a rule that, although the

5

employer in this case seems to take issue with it, is one

6

that has been understood by hundreds of courts over

7

hundreds of years, including this Court in a series of

8

cases including Rawlings v. Ray and others.

9

ordinarily when you're dealing with a debt a cause of

That is that

10

action accrues on a date that there is an obligation to

11

pay the debt, and -QUESTION:

12

So under your view, I mean, there

13

would be a separate cause of action for each instalment

14

payment.

15

MS. BERZON:

Well, that's correct as well,

16

although it was the third point that I was going to make,

17

and - -

18
19
20

QUESTION:

And that means that in theory it

could continue on for 26 years or so.
MS. BERZON:

There are two things to be said

21

about that.

One is that the reason, of course, why it is

22

possible that there could be suits for failure to pay,

23

make payments for a long period, is because Congress

24

allowed a long period in which these payments to be made.

25

In other words, Congress could have required that the

1

payment be made up front, but in fact, and largely for the

2

benefit of employers and so as not to require them to make

3

huge payments immediately - -

4

QUESTION:

5
6

And I suppose if there's an early

default the plan's sponsor could accelerate the balance.
MS. BERZON:

Correct.

This provision has an

7

express permissive acceleration clause which says that the

8

plan's sponsor may accelerate upon a default as defined in

9

the statute.

10

The statute defines default in a particular way

11

so that there needs to be a notice, first, of delinquency

12

and then 60 days from that notice before a default could

13

be declared.

14

QUESTION:

So under your theory the statute of

15

limitations in this case would have started to run 6 years

16

after the nonpayment of the first instalment.

17

MS. BERZON:

On the first instalment, and on

18

each instalment as it came due, because the debt was not

19

in fact accelerated and because of the additional fact

20

that under the more specific aspects of the statutory

21

scheme it actually could not have been accelerated because

22

although, as I said before, there is a permissive

23

acceleration clause, it was not operative during the

24

relevant periods in this case, and it wasn't operative

25

because first it was too early, that is, the 60 days had

not run at any period of time outside -QUESTION:

Ms. Berzon, you keep mentioning the

3

60 days, but as I understand it, that's -- that has never

4

been passed on by any court.

5

court of appeals that we are reviewing that puts you out

6

of the ball park entirely because it dates the time from

7

the withdrawal.

8

MS. BERZON:

9

QUESTION:

We have a decision from the

That's correct.
The argument that you made in your

10

brief about the 60-day period as I understand it was not

11

passed on by any court below, so you may be wrong, or you

12

may be right about it, but you are asking us to take a

13

first view of that question, which ordinarily we don't.

14

MS. BERZON:

Let me see if I can understand.

15

There are two different time or issues that you might be

16

referring to.

17

One is the question which, while not passed on

18

by the court below because of the view it took that the

19

date runs from withdrawal, has been addressed by other

20

courts of appeals, that is, by the Third Circuit and by

21

the Seventh Circuit, which is a purely legal issue, and

22

that is, if one agrees that the limitations period runs

23

from missed payments, not from the date of withdrawal,

24

does it run as it would under the common law with respect

25

to instalment payments generally -9

1

QUESTION:

Why should we reach that question

2

when the court we're reviewing hasn't reached it?

3

don't know what position they would take if they hadn't

4

gotten the first thing wrong, if they hadn't used the

5

withdrawal date, and you're arguing -- that's your basic

6

proposition.

7

that's the end of the case.

8

10

11

We

If the court of appeals is right about that,

If they're wrong about that, then there are
further issues that other courts of appeals have addressed
but this one never reached.
MS. BERZON:

That's true.

I would argue that

12

this is an area in which some guidance and certainty is of

13

some use to the practitioners and to the funds, and there

14

is, I would say -- the issue is certainly presented by the

15

facts of the case, and the overall issue of when the

16

statute of limitations runs or begins to run and in what

17

manner is presented by the case.

18

QUESTION:

But if you're right about the 60

19

days, so your whole thing would be timely, this other

20

question about each instalment is academic in your case

21

because it wouldn't matter.

22

MS. BERZON:

MS. BERZON:

1

the periodic-payment-by-periodic-payment issue, and that

2

is whether or not the first payment -- this lawsuit was

3

timely with respect to the first payment, and we do argue

4

that it was timely with respect to the first payment,

5

and - -

6

QUESTION:

Yes, and if you're right about that,

7

that -- the rest of it doesn't matter because you're in

8

under the wire.

9

MS. BERZON:

That's true.

There is some dispute

10

as to whether that's the case, and if you accept our

11

position that even as to the first missed payment this

12

suit was timely, because the earliest that we could have

13

required it to be paid was at the end of a 60-day period

14

from the demand --

15

QUESTION:

Yes, and that's something that you

16

have urged and that has not been passed on by any other

17

court, so I understand that the first question is

18

certainly before us, but I don't understand that anything

19

else is because it hasn't --we would be acting as a court

20

of first view, not a court of review.

21

MS. BERZON:

All right, but that is separate

22

from the issue of whether we necessarily prevail without

23

deciding that question, and the answer is we do not

24

necessarily prevail because of the schedule here, and

25

perhaps I can clarify that.

1

We filed suit here on February 9, 1993.

That

2

was within the 6-year period from the date on which the

3

demand letter required the entire withdrawal liability to

4

be paid if the employer so choose -- chose under the

5

prepayment option.

6

It was within 6 years of the date on which we

7

understand the statute to have permitted the first payment

8

to have been required, also 60 days, but the demand letter

9

actually said February 1, 1987, so the only argument on

10

which we possibly do not prevail on the entire debt -- and

11

here we're talking about a difference of $345 -- is if one

12

views the lawsuit as not timely from the date of the first

13

missed payment, because we said in our demand letter that

14

it was due on February 1, although in our view that was a

15

legal error.

16

that's at all clarified.

17

Actually it was due on February 10, if

So there are views of this case on which it does

18

matter whether the limitations period runs on a

19

instalment-by-instalment basis, and other views on which

20

it doesn't matter.

21

QUESTION:

But if you're right about even the

22

first payment, that you were timely, then why should we

23

get to the question of instalment or not?

24
25

MS. BERZON:

Well, if I'm right on the first

payment being timely then you don't need to.

that the option that you think is correct is not any of

the four that you listed in your cert petition, because

you said your -- first is the withdrawal date, second the

date when the payment becomes overdue, you're not relying

8

on that, then for each payment due, on the date the

9

payment becomes overdue unless the plan's sponsor elects

10

to evoke the statutory provision on acceleration or some

11

other date, at some other date you think is right, is when

12

13

MS. BERZON:

No.

Actually we believe that it is

14

for each payment due on the date that the payment becomes

15

overdue, unless the plan's sponsor elects to invoke --

But we would maintain, and do in

every -- we are timely with respect to the -- every --

2

each and every payment, but as I say, that is really in

3

some ways the least important problem here, because -QUESTION:

4

Well, maybe it isn't important in

5

this case, but you're saying it is certainly in the laws

6

of some importance to people who practice in this area.
MS. BERZON:

7

Right, exactly, and if you were to

8

conclude that we were right about that, then you really

9

wouldn't have to decide the payment-by-payment issue, and

10

if you were not, then you would have to go on to decide

11

whether, although the first missed payment had -- was

12

gone, every other payment was within the time period, as

13

any instalment contract lawyer would, you know, quickly

14

conclude.

15

I want to just very briefly, before reserving

16

the rest of my time, to comment on one issue that the

17

employer here has harped on quite frequently, and that is

18

the contention that on our view of the statute, that is

19

that it can -- the limitations period cannot possibly run

20

from the date of withdrawal, that there is some

21

fundamental problem because then we are - - we can

22

indefinitely delay assessment, and the plain answer to

23

that is that the Congress did deal with that problem.

24

dealt with -- saw the timeliness issues here as two

25

different ones, one dealing with the timeliness of the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD C. DUMONT

13

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE

14

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

15
16
17

MR. DUMONT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This is a statutory collection action, and it

18

may be helpful to return for a moment to the words of the

19

statute at issue, which are reprinted at page 17a of the

20

petitioner's brief.

21

29 U.S.C. section 1451(a)(1) gives a cause of

22

action to a plan fiduciary -- I'm eliding some material --

23

a plan fiduciary who is adversely affected by the act or

24

omission of any party under this subtitle who may bring an

25

action for appropriate legal or equitable relief.

Now, our basic submission, along with that of

1
2

petitioner's, is quite simple, first, that the only-

3

relevant adverse effects under the subtitle, under the

4

statute, arose not from respondent's withdrawal from the

5

plan, but from its failure to pay withdrawal liability on

6

the schedule prescribed by the statute.

7

QUESTION:

Why don't you take the position that

8

counsel for the petitioner does that the 60-day rule with

9

respect to the first payment actually makes the date of

10

adverse consequence the date upon which it could have been

11

demanded - - the date upon which it could have been

12

collected rather than the date upon which they demanded

13

the payment to be made?

14

MR. DUMONT:

15

of that section of the statute.

16

best reading.

17

We -- that is a conceivable reading
We don't think it's the

We think that the statutory section is best read

18

to give that 60 days as a terminus before which the plan

19

must make the payment due, but I think if you look at

20

normal practice, from what I understand from the PBGC, and

21

also the reported cases make this fairly clear, the normal

22

practice is for plans to set a date that is within the 60

23

days but is not actually the sixty-first day from the date

24

of demand.

25

And that makes a lot of practical sense, because

1

what you - - what the plan often wants to do is make the

2

payment due on the same day that the payments normally

3

were due before the withdrawal, or on some day that's

4

convenient for accounting purposes, as opposed to being

5

tied to a specific thirtieth or sixtieth day from the date

6

of demand, which would unduly constrain either the date

7

you want to send the notice or the date that you set the

8

payment to be due, so we think the best reading is --

9

QUESTION:

But would -- if they sued on the

10

stated day, which was before the sixty-first day, would

11

they be subject to a motion to dismiss?

12

13

MR. DUMONT:

We believe the payment is due on

the day that is specified in the schedule --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. DUMONT:

So the answer is no?
The answer is that suit would be

16

timely if it was before the sixty-first day, but after the

17

day that the payment was due under the schedule.

18

QUESTION:

Well, so you're saying that even

19

though the schedule set forth a date before the sixty-

20

first day, suit would be timely 6 years after the sixty-

21

first day, and that there was a failure to pay?

22

MR. DUMONT:

No.

The suit would have to be

23

filed within 6 years of the day specified in the plan's

24

schedule as the day the first payment was due, is our

25

position, which is not the position the petitioners are

taking.
QUESTION:

So you are rejecting their 60-day --

3

under your reading of the statute,

4

too late to recover the first payment,

5

MR. DUMONT:

the first -- they sued
is that --

That's correct, which is why in our

6

view of the way the statute is best construed it is

7

necessary for the Court to reach the question passed on by

8

the Seventh Circuit, which is, was there only one cause of

9

action and therefore when the first payment was missed was

10

there a sort of automatic acceleration back to that point,

11

so that if you missed the first payment you missed

12

everything.

13

QUESTION:

Then you think that 60-day is so

14

clearly wrong on the petitioner's part that it shouldn't

15

be something that we should remand to the court of

16

appeals, which never considered it?

17

MR. DUMONT:

I think it's perfectly within this

18

Court's options to reject the rule that the Ninth Circuit

19

came up with, which was running from the date of

20

withdrawal, and to leave all the other issues for

21

resolution below.

22

That would not be what we would think was the

23

most appropriate outcome, and we think there are several

24

questions that are fairly presented and fairly subsumed

25

within the question, and that the Court could usefully

make clear for the benefit of the bar, but certainly it

2

would be proper for the Court merely to resolve the narrow

3

question you suggest.
QUESTION:

4

This 60-day dispute for purposes of

5

the present case is only relevant as to the first payment,

6

but the issue, the issue of whether the 60 days is what

7

counts or not, applies to every payment set under this

8

scheme, doesn't it?
MR. DUMONT:

9
10

It's not just the first payment.
That's correct.

I'm sorry, which

60 days, now, are we talking about there?
QUESTION:

11

Well, that's what I'm -- as I read

12

the statute, it says the failure of an employer to pay any

13

overdue withdrawal liability payment, any payment, not

14

just the first, within 60 days after the employer receives

15

written notification from the plan's sponsor that the

16

payment is overdue.

17

you're talking about?

25

and our submission there, which is fairly important, is

2

that that default -- the definition of default is relevant

3

for only one thing, and that is whether or not the plan is

entitled under the statute to accelerate the entire

2

flexibility in setting the beginning of the schedule, but

it sets an outer limit past which they may not go.

7

It allows the plan some

They

Really, in sum we have only four points to make,

8

first that accrual, as is the general rule everywhere,

9

follows the right to sue, and here the right to sue under

10

the statute arises not from withdrawal, as the Ninth

11

Circuit held, but from the failure to make a statutory

12

payment when due under the statute, and that's the only

13

thing the plan could ever have sued for, and that's all

14

they sued for here.

15

The further consequences of that we think follow

16

from a routine application of principles of -- general

17

principles of law under the statutes of limitations and

18

acceleration law, and all of these rules I think

19

importantly work together to support Congress' fundamental

20

purpose here in this entire scheme, which is to protect

21

beneficiaries of these plans by strengthening and

22

stabilizing the multiemployer pension plan system by

23

ensuring, to the extent possible, a steady flow of even

24

payments on which the plan can count, and with full

25

provision for protecting the employer after an arbitration

and after any determination of defenses on the merits by

making a refund available.

3

All we are talking about here is interim

4

payments while a dispute on the merits goes forward.

6

now, and this action is timely to collect them.

QUESTION:

Is there an argument that the suit on

8

the merits shouldn't go forward because an arbitration

9

request, demand had been made and not responded to?

10
11
12

13

How

does that play into this?
MR. DUMONT:

When I speak of a dispute on the

merits, I refer to a dispute before the arbitrator.
It is true that in the complaint, as a response

14

to the complaint in this case, the employer raised an

15

affirmative defense that there had been a failure to

16

respond to the request for arbitration, and we think that

17

is not well-taken, but certainly the court on remand could

18

consider that.

19

We think the right result would be for it to go

20

to arbitration and have all of the employer's objections

21

to any particulars of the assessment here handled in

22

arbitration between the parties.

If the trustee did not know which had been

chosen, how would there be a cause of action yet, since

3

they have till February 10 to make the election, and if

there is no cause of action on February 8, then how can it

QUESTION:

The court of appeals also, has my

But if that's a correct reading, then is that

MR. TERHEYDEN:

Then - I don't know if that's -- if

it's -- I don't know if it's the end of this matter,

5

because we still have the ancillary question of whether it

6

started at the time of withdrawal, which would set it all

back at a time earlier.

QUESTION:

Unless we say withdrawal, and if

that's right then they can get the first payment and

10

everything in your view, if we reject your argument as to

11

the withdrawal.

12

MR. TERHEYDEN:

Well, I guess I do view it as

13

running, Your Honor, with one and the same time, February

14

1, and that the time of the first -- the option was the

15

time of the -- February 1 a time when the payment

16

schedules could be begin, or as an option, because it's an

17

option here.

18

Congress has given them an option to do one or

19

the other, and so I view those options as coming into

20

place at one and the same time, and so if the schedule of

21

monthly payments was to begin on February 1, then, since

22

those options run at one and the same time, we view the

23

time for the lump sum payment also to have begun on

24

February 1.

Well, what is your theory,

1

Mr. Terheyden, as to why the statute of limitations should

2

begin running from the date of withdrawal?

3

MR. TERHEYDEN:

Our theory there, Your Honor, is

4

that Congress has spoken in section 1451 (a) .

We hunted

5

around, could there be anything which says it only

6

starts -- any statutory provision that only starts at the

7

time of the first missed payment.

8

We couldn't find anything, but section 1451 says

9

that a fiduciary, in this case a trust fund, could bring a

10

lawsuit, may maintain an action if it has been adversely

11

affected by an act or omission of another party.

12

may -- Congress has said that.

It

It may bring an action.

13

Now, at the time the company, an employer

14

withdraws, the trust fund at that time is adversely

15

affected.

The contributions are no longer flowing in,

17

QUESTION:

But there is a substitute that the

18

statute provides, this payment -- the series of payments,

19

isn't there?

20

MR. TERHEYDEN:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. TERHEYDEN:

Well, that's --

Isn't that a compensation?
No.

That's an option.

Again,

23

that's an option.

24

has fixated, fixed in on the payment, but I think that's

25

an option.

It's not -- it's -- I know petitioner

It's one or the other.

2

Well, what would the suit say if the

MR. TERHEYDEN:

3

In the unlikely event that it

was filed the day after the withdrawal they would be

5

asking under 1451(a) for the amount to come from the

6

employer, and I think it would be 1) in an amount of

MR. TERHEYDEN:

then is, Congress has said at the time -- in 1381(a) at

It's an instantaneous thing, and I think --

claim for relief that's unripe?

17

at the point when withdrawal liability kicks in the

employer has done nothing wrong?

19

there's a payment due that has not been paid.
MR. TERHEYDEN:

not.

There's not a wrong.

QUESTION:

I mean, do you agree that

There's no wrong until

It's not illegal to withdraw,

MR. TERHEYDEN:

I understand.

This is what

12

happened in the Joyce case, which -- one of the main cases

13

petitioner relies on.

14

The trust fund sent out the demand on the very

15

same day they filed the lawsuit, and the issue was brought

16

up there, was this premature or not, and the reason -- the

17

trust fund said the reason we did it is because we weren't

18

sure when the statute of limitations ran, but we'd better

19

make sure we protect our rights, and I think that's what

20

the fund would have to do here.

QUESTION:

I think here they

I mean, when you -- I'm not following

5

your example of Joyce, because Joyce was presented, as you

6

say, in a climate where the law was uncertain, so - - but

7

there was a determination of the payments that were due.

8

The schedule was out, right?

9

MR. TERHEYDEN:

Yes, but the employer hadn't

10

refused at that point, at time they filed suit, and they

11

were able to stay into court, because by the time it came

12

up through the court, the district court system, they --

13

there was no payment by the employer, so they were

14

legitimately able to file their lawsuit the same day they

15

sent the payment.

16

QUESTION:

So - - but there was a claim by the

17

employer's -- on the employer's part that that claim was

18

untimely, right, in Joyce, because it wasn't within

19

6 years from when the withdrawal liability -- from when

20

the withdrawal occurred.

21

MR. TERHEYDEN:

That's true.

They were saying,

I think -- there the employer said, as we do here, it

23

adhered back to the time of the actual withdrawal.

First, it's important to be clear that -- and I think it

2

is clear that this is a statutory obligation.

3

the schedule is a statutory obligation, and the employer,

4

while it has the option to prepay under 1399 (c) (4), it

5

doesn't have the option to not pay and say that it has

6

chosen a total payment option but it isn't doing it.

7

The statute isn't set up that way.

The statute

8

is set up with a baseline obligation to pay on a schedule,

9

a periodic payment basis, and the only way that the

10

employer doesn't have to meet that payment-by-payment

11

obligation is if it prepays the entire amount.

12

This employer has not prepaid the entire amount,

13

and therefore it had a prepay -- a payment-by-payment

14

obligation which was not contractual, which should not

15

depend upon it making the first payment at all, but which

16

went into effect with the demand letter and stayed there

17

for the entire period that the payments were due.

18

the first point.

19

That's

And the second point is, which is related, is to

20

respond to Justice Breyer's dealing with this case in

21

particular, and I would agree with perhaps the slight

22

twist in the explanation.

23

On page 24 of the joint appendix the demand

24

letter does, indeed, say that $45,570 can be paid within

25

60 days after the receipt of this letter, which was

actually probably sometime after February 10 would have

is the payment-by-payment obligation which is the

6

statutory obligation, and absent a permissive acceleration

7

by the fund at a time when it can make the acceleration,

8

which it couldn't here, that's the only obligation.

But if somehow one thought that there was

another obligation, i.e., a lump sum payment, we know when

that was one due, and it was due within the limitations
