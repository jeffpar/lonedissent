CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
To obtain a conviction under the Federal money­

11

laundering statutes, the Government must prove that the

12

defendant engaged in a financial transaction, that the

13

property involved in that transaction represented the

14

proceeds of specified unlawful activity, and that the

15

defendant knew that the funds were illegally acquired.

16

The Government has alleged in this case that

17

respondent violated the money-laundering statutes by

18

engaging in banking transactions in Florida using funds

19

that were acquired through cocaine-trafficking activities

20

in Missouri.

21

proper in Missouri, the place where the unlawful

22

generation of funds is alleged to have occurred.

23

The question presented is whether venue was

This Court's decisions have recognized two

24

principal criteria on which venue may be based.

25

prosecution may ordinarily be brought in any district

First, a

where conduct constituting an element of the offense

occurs.

3

of a Federal crime, the prosecution may generally be

4

brought in any district where that effect is felt.

Second, where a particular effect is an element

For purposes of the present case, the crucial

5
6

point is that neither of those bases for laying venue

7

requires that the prosecution be brought in a district

8

where the defendant personally committed an unlawful act.
In the Government's view, Missouri is an

9
10

appropriate forum for this prosecution on both of the

11

foregoing approaches.

12

conduct constituting an element of the offense, namely the

First, Missouri is the place where

3

drug-trafficking crimes that generated the laundered

4

funds, is alleged to have occurred.

5

Second, Missouri is the place where the harmful

6

effects of respondent's money-laundering were principally

7

felt, since the evil of money-laundering consists of its

8

capacity to conceal and thus facilitate the predicate

9

crimes.

20

Finally, trial in Missouri furthers the purposes

21

underlying the requirement that a criminal offense be

22

prosecuted at the place where the offense was committed.

23

Now, both Article III of the Constitution and

24

the Sixth Amendment require that a criminal offense be

25

prosecuted at the place where the offense shall have been

2

QUESTION:

Does it make any difference at all,

3

Mr. Stewart, whether the defendant had any knowledge of

4

the circumstances of the predicate offense or any link at

5

all with the State in which that was carried out?

6

MR. STEWART:

To establish guilt under the

7

money-laundering statutes the defendant would have to be

8

shown to have known that the funds were illegally

9

acquired, so to -QUESTION:

10

Well,

the defendant presumably could

11

have been told by somebody, look,

12

13

of New York by someone from Missouri, and the someone

14

says, these are illegally obtained funds but I need your

15

help to put them in a bank and do such-and-such with them.

16

Is that enough to prosecute in this case?

17

I got these funds

Maybe the defendant is told that in the State

Yes, under our view it is.

That's correct.

In mean,

in this

1

case there are more substantial contacts between the

2

respondent and the Western District of Missouri, but

3

you're correct, under our theory that's not an essential

4

feature of the grounds for laying venue.

5
6

7

QUESTION:

Well, what cases do you think justify

that particular approach?
MR. STEWART:

I think the two best cases in this

8

Court would be Hyde v. United States and In Re Palliser.

9

Hyde v. United States involved a prosecution for

10

conspiracy, in which the petitioners in this Court were

11

prosecuted in the District of Columbia.

12

for conspiracy.

13

They were not --

They were not alleged to have personally

14

committed an unlawful act in the District of Columbia, or

15

ever to have been there, but it was held that because co­

16

conspirators had committed overt acts in furtherance of

17

the conspiracy in the District of Columbia, that that was

18

an appropriate venue, and --

19

QUESTION:

Well, I -- it's a little easier to

20

see, isn't it, in a conspiracy context.

21

have a conspiracy charge here.

22

MR. STEWART:

Of course, you

It -- you're correct that in some

23

sense the link between the defendant and the co­

24

conspirators may be more direct than the link between the

25

money-launderer and the persons who perpetrate the

1

2

predicate crimes.
Nevertheless, to us the crucial point is that

3

the evil of money-laundering is not that the transactions

4

are per se unlawful or harmful.

5

laundering consists precisely of the fact that it assists

6

in the concealment and thus the facilitation of the

7

predicate criminal act --

8

9
10

QUESTION:

Well, what about receiving stolen

property, one of the examples mentioned, I think, in one
of the briefs.

11

MR. STEWART:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

The evil of money­

I --

You know, the property is stolen in

State A, and then it's received and resold in State B.
MR. STEWART:

It certainly is our theory that

15

the prosecution could be brought in State A for much the

16

same reasons, that because the evil of the offense is that

17

it facilitates or conceals the crime that occurred in

18

jurisdiction A, and because the harm of the crime is felt

19

in jurisdiction A, it therefore makes sense to prosecute

20

the offense there.

21

QUESTION:

Well, how does receiving stolen

22

property in New York conceal the existence of a crime,

23

say, in Chicago?

24
25

MR. STEWART:

Well, for one thing, if the person

in New York receives it and profits by it rather than, for

1

instance, turning over the evidence to the police, in that

2

sense it conceals the offense.

3

It certainly facilitates the offense in that the

4

crime of stealing property is more profitable and

5

therefore is more likely to occur if there are people out

6

there who will - -

7
8

9

QUESTION:

I can see how it facilitates it, but

to say it conceals it, I really don't follow that.
MR. STEWART:

I guess it would be accurate to

10

say it conceals it only if we compare the person who

11

receives the stolen property to the person who becomes

12

aware of the theft and reports it to the authorities.

13

QUESTION:

I take it on your theory -- how do

14

you feel about controlled substances?

15

quite a few that the Attorney General has to put on a list

16

or they're not controlled, so does that mean as to any

17

such substance every drug crime could be prosecuted,

18

wherever it takes place, in Washington, D.C.?

19

MR. STEWART:

I mean, there are

No, I don't think so, because the

20

Attorney General's act of putting the controlled substance

21

on the list would not in any sense be conduct that the ban

22

on possession --

offense?

2

MR. STEWART:

3

QUESTION:

It's no --

I mean, if the substance is not on

4

the list, then you can't prosecute the person for the

5

offense.

6

MR. STEWART:

It would not be conduct that it

7

was the purpose of the controlled substance statutes to

8

prohibit or deter, and I think --

9

QUESTION:

Oh --

QUESTION:

Element of an offense is not a

separate justification, as you said in your initial

12

presentation.

MR. STEWART:

MR. STEWART:

20

QUESTION:

I said in the opening statement

It's not sufficient, then.
That's correct.

So what else do you -- I mean,

21

it's -- your theory is that although all the conduct

22

relevant here took place in Florida, I take it, but there

23

was some element of the offense that took place in a

24

different State, that that element of the offense does

25

MR. STEWART:

2

Well,

I would dispute the

3

proposition that all of the conduct that's relevant here

4

occurred in Florida.

5

which the respondent - QUESTION:

6

It's true that the only conduct in

Yes,

all the conduct -- and similarly

7

the Attorney General's conduct of putting a drug on a list

8

took place in Washington, D.C., but that conduct which

9

created an element of the offense does not count for

10

venue, but here the conduct of the activity and element of

11

the offense in Missouri does, because --

12

MR. STEWART:

There's an intensely practical

13

reason for that,

14

underlying the constitutional requirement that the crime

15

be prosecuted at the place where it was committed was to

16

facilitate the production of relevant evidence, and it's

very likely,

MR. STEWART:

QUESTION:

4

MR. STEWART:

I --

-- in being tried at home?
I think -- well, it was designed

5

to protect the defendant's interest, but clearly if the

6

Framers had been concerned only with the defendant's

7

convenience, or with the right of the defendant to be

8

tried at home, the Constitution would say that the

9

defendant has a right to be tried in the district of her

10

residence.

11

The Constitution doesn't say that.

12

recognizes that the defendant's -- the interest in the

defendant's convenience should not be so overwhelming as

14

to frustrate --

Mr. Stewart, in the Constitution --

this is mentioned twice in the Constitution, and in the

Sixth Amendment it says, the accused shall enjoy the

MR. STEWART:

6

I'm not suggesting that they put

7

the provision in there in order to protect the

8

prosecution.

9

constitutional provisions represent a balancing of the

10

What I am saying is that they -- the

defendant's and the Government's interest.
That is, if the Framers had wanted to protect

11
12

the convenience of the defendant at all costs, they could

13

have said the defendant has the right to trial in the

14

district of her residence.

State, but it's in aid of something that went on earlier

in another State?
MR. STEWART:

5

What other crimes

Well, in terms of something that

6

went on earlier, I think there isn't so much authority.

7

The principle is well-established in cases, for instance,

8

involving aiding and abetting, where a person in

9

jurisdiction A assists in the planning or preparation for

10

a crime that's to occur --

MR. STEWART:

the cases that there's receiving stolen property, and

there's jury tampering, and there's money-laundering.

3

What else?

4

MR. STEWART:

I think perhaps the best example

5

would be offenses involving the use of the mails, or the

6

channels of interstate commerce, where Congress has

7

provided by statute that those offenses can be prosecuted

8

in any district, for instance, where the mail was sent,

9

where the mail was received, or even in a district through

10

which the mail passes in transit, and the idea is that

I think -- it -- I think it is a

20

good example, at least to the extent that it shows that

21

the Constitution does not guarantee the defendant the

22

right to trial in a district where she personally acted.

contention being made here by the defendant, I don't

1

And the Palliser case really is the

mailing in one district to a postmaster in another

district a solicitation that's unlawful, and it seems to

4

me that that falls considerably short of showing that the

Government should prevail here.
MR. STEWART:

7

Well, I think the Palliser case

QUESTION:

MR. STEWART:
QUESTION:

10
11

the Palliser novels?

12

Palliser.

I think it's Palliser.
Oh, Palliser.

Have you read the Trollope novels,
I think those are always pronounced

13

MR. STEWART:

Okay.

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

14

The Palliser case involved the use of the mails.

15

The Palliser case also cited authorities dealing with the

16

crime of murder, that established that the crime of murder

17

may typically be prosecuted at the place where the fatal

18

blow -- the fatal force was struck or the poison

19

administered, even if that was not the place where the

20

defendant acted, for instance, the hypothetical which

21

appears to have arisen, at least on occasion, where a

22

person standing in jurisdiction A shoots a gun across the

23

border and hits a person in jurisdiction B.

24
25

So I think the Court in Palliser was not
announcing a holding that was unique to the mail setting.

Rather, it was relying on a more general principle that a

2

person may be held accountable for harm caused in another

3

jurisdiction even if he never sets foot there.

4

QUESTION:

So your --

5

QUESTION:

Well, but there's a difference, it

6

seems to me, in prospective and retroactive.

Under your

7

view, as I understand it, if methamphetamine is

8

manufactured in Arizona and it goes through about four

9

different distributors and ends up in New York, you're

10

going to be able to prosecute the New York, what do you

11

call him, mule, or the ultimate seller in Arizona.

12

think that's what you're saying, and -- but that's, to me

13

backward-looking.

14

I

Now, if he -- if the defendant intends to cause

15

or should know that what he does will have a prospective

16

effect in some other jurisdiction, that's quite different

17

MR. STEWART:

I mean, I think Your Honor is

18

correct in saying that the defendant in a money­

19

laundering case doesn't cause the narcotics-trafficking

20

activities to occur, but I think it's nevertheless the

21

case that the harm of those -- the money-laundering

22

activities is felt in the district where the predicate

23

crimes took place.

24
25

That is, the transactions prohibited by the
money-laundering statutes are not prohibited because they

assist in the concealment and facilitation of the

underlying crimes.

They are prohibited because they

You're not backing away from my

description of your position as to the meth prosecution

being in Arizona, even though it was sold by someone who

7

has never been in Arizona and it's gone through three

8

different stages and it's in New York City?
MR. STEWART:

9
10

I guess I'm not sure about the

precise scope of your hypothetical.
QUESTION:

11

Well, the hypothetical is that meth

12

is manufactured in Arizona, it's sold by two or three

13

different people, and it's finally sold by some guy on the

14

street in New York, and it seems to me, under your point

15

MR. STEWART:

I think that may not be accurate,

because I think in the prosecution of the street seller it

would not in any sense be an element of the crime,

I think that probably would fall

it would be hard to detect the activity going on if you

couldn't go after the counterfeiting, but the harm that

results from counterfeiting bills occurs at the moment

4

they're passed to innocent people, and to return to

Justice Ginsburg's question for a second, I think you were

6

right that part of the purpose of the Sixth Amendment's

7

guarantee of a right to trial in the place where the crime

8

shall have been committed is to assure that a jury from

9

the relevant community sits in judgment upon the accused,

10

but in our view, the relevant community here is the

11

Western District of Missouri.

12

QUESTION:

That is --

Well, but Mr. Stewart, may I ask you

13

a question that goes one step further on that question of

14

purpose.

15

Constitution has done in the vicinage provision

16

historically, as I understand it, was to select a jury

17

from the place where the evidence was going to be found.

18

The reason for selecting the community that the

Originally, if you go far enough back, it

19

reflects the fact that the jury in fact supplied evidence.

20

Later on the theory was still maintained and, as I

21

understand it, the theory was maintained in order to

22

prevent the Crown or later the Government from taking

23

people from the places where they are accused of having

24

committed a crime, spiriting them away to another part of

25

the kingdom, or another part of the country, where the

1

Government can, with its power, get all the evidence it

2

wants, but where the individual is probably not going to

3

be very effective in getting any defense evidence.

4

Now, assuming that that -- and I think that's a

5

fair statement of at least an important historical

6

consideration.

7

is it, I suppose, not a positive justification for the

8

position that you take, but it shows that the kind of

9

evidence that you want to prove these nonact elements

If that is so, then it is not -- not only

10

really is the kind of evidence that the provision is not

11

concerned with at all.

12

For example, the fact that the money was

13

counterfeited somewhere is not an important fact.

14

Government has got to prove is that the counterfeiting,

15

the counterfeited bill was passed at the place where the

16

defendant committed that particular crime.

All the

17

So that it seems to me that no purpose within

18

the Sixth Amendment is served by having a jury anywhere

19

except in places where the evidence either of the cause or

20

the effect of the crime is likely to be found, so if we

21

get into purpose, it seems to me that purpose argues

22

against you.

23

Am I wrong in my assumption about the purposes?

24

MR. STEWART:

25

I think you are right in your

assumption about the purposes, and I - - we would

1

respectfully disagree with the assertion that the purposes

2

are not served here.

3

That is, in the instant case, for example, it's

4

very unlikely to be a fact in dispute that the banking

5

transactions which are alleged to have occurred in Florida

6

actually occurred as stated in the indictment.

7

conceivable that that will be disputed, but it's unlikely.

It's

8

What is most likely to be disputed if this case

9

goes to trial is, first, whether the money was unlawfully

10
11

generated and, second, whether the respondent knew it.
Now, you're correct in saying that it's possible

12

that we could prove the money was unlawfully generated

13

without proving where the predicate crimes occurred, but

14

certainly a very good way of proving that the money was

15

unlawfully generated would be to prove the circumstances

16

underlying the drug-trafficking activities, particularly

17

in a case where the Government has already gotten a

18

conviction for the drug conspiracy that is alleged to have

19

generated the laundered funds.

would provide venue, but I do suppose that on your theory

2

the place of the predicate felony would be within your

3

choice of venue, and yet the only thing you have to prove

4

is, in fact, that a felony was committed, which you do by

5

record.

There's no need to go to that jurisdiction.
MR. STEWART:

6

I don't think it follows that the

7

place where the felony was committed would be an

8

appropriate venue.

9

because it wouldn't be necessary or even permissible in a

10

922(g) prosecution for us to present independent evidence

11

that the defendant had actually committed the prior crime.

12

We would simply be introducing the judgment of conviction

13

or relying upon a stipulation.

First, we wouldn't be proving conduct,

14

But the -- as to the counterfeiting, I think

15

that the -- having the trial in the district where the

16

counterfeiting took place might or might not be a sensible

venue.

That is, if the Government --

QUESTION:

19

MR. STEWART:

Why might it be?
It might be because I assume that

20

an element of the offense of passing counterfeiting money

21

is that the person knew that it was counterfeited and, at

22

least in some cases, one of the ways of proving that the

23

defendant knew that the money was counterfeit was to show

24

that he was the one who manufactured it and perhaps took

25

it to distant locations to pass it, but that he was

involved in the operation.
So depending on the facts of an individual case,

3

evidence concerning the circumstances upon - - under which

4

the money was manufactured might or might not be relevant

5

to the prosecution.

6

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose if that's what you're

7

going to rely on for proof you would prosecute him for

8

manufacturing the counterfeited bill in the jurisdiction

9

in which he did it.

10

MR. STEWART:

We might prosecute him for that.

11

We could also have a circumstance --we could also have

12

cases in which it was clear that money had been passed

13

from jurisdiction A to jurisdiction B, and the

14

circumstances under which the counterfeiting occurred

15

would be relevant to the prosecution.

16

QUESTION:

I'm not sure you have to win the

counterfeiting case in order to win this case.

19

sure it is the same as the one that was in your briefs.

You are -- you're insisting upon two things before you can

22

occurred in Missouri be an element of the crime, but not

indeterminacy at the margins as to the way that certain

cases should come out.

a sense, whether venue would be proper at those sites

question.

May I ask about your suggestion that

the fact the money was illegal -- the taint of the money

occurred in Missouri makes venue proper there.

that the money was tainted, with the proceeds of drug

say you -- they actually proved that occurred across the

river, would the offense not have been proved?

3

MR. STEWART:

No.

It is not necessary to prove

the location in that sense, but that really seems to us

analogous to the situation involving use of the mails,

6

where the Federal statute says that offenses involving the

7

use of the mails may be prosecuted in any district through

8

which the mailed matter passes.

9

That doesn't mean that the Government in a

prosecution involving use of the mails has to prove the

identity of all those districts.

QUESTION:

Why is aiding and abetting different
You say that the Government can enact

a statute, which is called an aiding and abetting statute
which will render your client liable to be hauled into
Missouri to defend the case simply because the Government
says that the essence of the crime is aiding and abetting
Here, the Government has said that the essence
of the crime is laundering, not just any money, or doing
this financial deal not just with any money, but with
money that was the product of a drug - - of a drug
enterprise.

Why can't -- why doesn't that suffice, just

as an aiding and abetting statute would, to enable your

suggestion, because this may be what's defeating the

Don't you, on your theory, have to make a

5

distinction between aiding and abetting which, in fact,

6

facilitates the commission of the crime in the first place

7

and aiding and abetting after the fact of the crime that

8

involved no pre-criminal agreement?
Your theory -- the reason I pose the question

9

•7

Mr. Rogers, may I interrupt with this

10

that way is this.

11

conspiracy and aiding and abetting liability with the

12

Constitution was something like this:

13

with aiding and abetting in effect is like an agent of the

14

individual who actually commits the criminal act, what you

15

call the actus reis, and therefore when the agent acts,

16

the agent is, in fact, acting for the aider and abettor,

17

acting for the conspirator.

I thought your theory for reconciling

the person charged

That works fine, it seems to me, until you get

19

20

call aiding and abetting was the individual who, under the

Congress named it aiding and abetting and then essentially
passed an accessory-after-the-fact statute.

I agree with

that.
As far as the -- the Government's put forth two
primary arguments, and one is that we can base venue on an

I think that clearly is not the case

The other one is that the effects of the crime

Sure.

I don't think that would

make any difference for venue analysis.

I think if you --

for instance, if the Unabomber sent a bomb to New Jersey
and intended to kill the president of a corporation and
intended to harm that corporation, that doesn't mean
venue's proper where the harm is felt.

murder and the widow is obviously affected by the murder
that was committed, and even if you meant to affect the
widow, that doesn't mean venue's proper there.

as then causing the narcotics enterprise to continue their

activities by agreeing to launder their money, I think in

QUESTION:

Yes, but I was just wondering why, on

the Government's side, there was this admission that she

wasn't involved in transporting, or that at least what

they charged doesn't involve that.

MR. ROGERS:

I couldn't speak for the Government

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. STEWART:

As the exchange between Mr. Rogers

7

and Justices Scalia and Souter indicates, really the

8

respondent's position stands or falls with the proposition

9

that there is a constitutionally significant difference

10

between being an aider and abettor and being an accessory

11

after the fact, and I think the fact that Congress has

12

chosen to define an aider and abettor as --

QUESTION:

Of course, in the aider and abettor,

you've got to aid something that hasn't yet happened.
Let me ask you this.

What difference does it
