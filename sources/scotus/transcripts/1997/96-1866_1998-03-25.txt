ORAL ARGUMENT OF TERRY L. WELDON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. WELDON:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case is the standard under

12

which a school district can be held liable for violation

13

of Title IX of the education amendments when one of its

14

teachers intentionally discriminates against one of his

15

students by engaging in sexual harassment of her.

16

Petitioner was clearly subjected to intentional

17

discrimination under, using the terminology of this

18

statute, under the educational programs and activities

19

provided by the respondent.

20

QUESTION:

Was there some showing that it was

21

discriminatory?

22

the various briefs in the proceeding and there's virtually

23

no mention of discrimination.

24

sexual harassment.

25

Because I read many of the statements in

MR. WELDON:

There's a lot of mention of

1

the documents in the case that are in the joint appendix,

2

we're using the term, sexual harassment, as synonymous

3

with discrimination, and I believe the Franklin court --

4
5

QUESTION:

Well,

I think in Oncale we said it

wasn't.

6

MR. WELDON:

7

QUESTION:

Well -That you have to show that the

8

treatment -- not only that the treatment was harassing,

9

but that it was -- you were treating one sex on a basis

10

that you would not have treated the other sex.
MR. WELDON:

11

And I think that's amply shown by

12

the record in this case and I think that the Franklin case

13

simply stands for the proposition that when a teacher

14

intentionally harasses a student,

15

based on sex.

16
17

QUESTION:

that is discrimination

Well, the Franklin case said there's

a private cause of action.

18

MR. WELDON:

19

QUESTION:

Yes,

sir.

But are you saying that it would be

20

enough if you showed there was just harassment of a

21

student by a teacher of a different sex?

22

23
24
25

MR. WELDON:

If the harassment was based on sex,

yes.
QUESTION:

Well, I think the statute says you

have to discriminate on the basis of sex.

You have to - -

the teacher has to treat students of one sex differently

from another.

MR. WELDON:
what happened.

And in this case that's exactly

The teacher singled out this young girl.

5

QUESTION:

Because of her sex?

6

MR. WELDON:

7

The Fifth Circuit standard from which we appeal

Because of her sex.

8

would require proof of actual knowledge not only in the

9

school district generally but in the superior of the

10

teacher who was guilty of the discrimination, or at least

11

in some person who had immediate power over that teacher

12

with respect to - -

13

QUESTION:

Well, you know, I think the tough

14

question we need to answer here is whether a suit under

15

Title IX, which this is, I think --

16

MR. WELDON:

17

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
-- should be governed by the

18

principles of Title VII suits, or whether there is some

19

different standard here under Title IX because essentially

20

it's a Federal financial grant program under Title IX, and

21

it's quite possible that agency principles don't apply to

22

Title IX at all.

Are you going to address that question?

23

MR. WELDON:

24

The - - there are obvious similarities between

25

I'll do it right now.

Title VII and Title IX in that they have as their object

1

the prevention or redress of sexual discrimination, but

2

there are important differences as well.

3

As we are argue in some detail in the brief,

4

those differences lead, I think, to the conclusion that

5

Title IX provides wider protection even though it does not

6

use the word agent in a definitional way as Title VII does

7

with respect to employers.

8

9

The reason for that is that the focus of the two
statutes is quite different.

The focus in Title VII\

10

says -- is on the employer, and it tells what the employer

11

and his agents are prohibited from doing.

12

As the Court pointed out early on in the Cannon

13

case, the focus of Title IX is completely different.

The

14

focus there is on the beneficiary, and the focus is on

15

discrimination without respect to who might be guilty of

16

the discrimination.

17

QUESTION:

But, what about the supposed

18

constitutional distinction between them?

I mean, the

19

argument is being made on the other side that under what

20

is in effect a spending power, piece of spending power

21

legislation, an obligation cannot be imposed upon the

22

Government that takes the money, which is not very clearly

23

spelled out.

24

And if the standard of liability for the

25

employer is not clearly spelled out, then the only

1

Standard that can be applied is that which necessarily

2

would be applied if there's going to be liability at all,

3

i.e. in this case actual knowledge.

4

What's your response to that argument?

5

MR. WELDON:

The respondent, with all respect, I

6

think overreads the Spending Clause and overreads the

7

cases that construe the Spending Clause.

8

and I'm referring specifically to Pennhurst, my belief is

9

that the Spending Clause statute must fairly inform the

My belief is,

10

recipient of the funds what the conditions of the funding

11

are.
At the time in question in this case the school

12

3

district obviously knew the contents of Title IX.

4

school district obviously knew the contents of regulations

5

which have the force of statute because the statute

6

authorizes the Department of Education and predecessor

7

agencies to enact these regulations.

8
9

QUESTION:

The

Well, are you saying that there were

regulations at the time in question here that indicated

20

that the standard of employer liability for employee

21

conduct would be something different from actual

22

knowledge?

23

MR. WELDON:

24

QUESTION:

MR. WELDON:

That would be my -What did they say?

1

implication of your question, Justice Souter, and that is

2

that I do not believe that the Pennhurst case or any of

3

the Spending Clause cases require any extensive catalogue

4

of what facts or what fact patterns might trigger

5

liability, any more than the Spending Clause requires an

6

exhaustive listing of the potential remedies that might

7

follow if there is a violation.
QUESTION:

8

9

Do you draw any distinction between

the significance of the Spending Clause for primary

10

liability -- i.e., the liability of the employee, or the

11

conduct - -

12

MR. WELDON:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.
-- which could give rise to liability

14

and, on the other hand, the significance of the Spending

15

Clause argument for determinations of imputed or vicarious

16

liability?

17

those two different questions?

18

MR. WELDON:

Are the implications different in those -- for

I think -- to the extent that there

19

are differences, I think they get resolved the same way.

20

I think that the Spending Clause simply -- and I don't

21

mean to oversimplify, but simply requires that the

22

recipient of Federal funds have some idea, some clear idea

23

what the conditions of accepting the fund are, and here I

24

find no ambiguity in anything that the school district --

QUESTION:

1

Of course,

it's sort of swallowing

2

the camel and straining out the gnat if - - inasmuch as the

3

statute doesn't even show on its face that there's a

4

private cause of action at all.

5

MR. WELDON:

6

QUESTION:

Yes,

sir.

If we really believe strongly in the

7

principle that Spending Clause impositions upon the States

8

must be clearly expressed,

action here at all, right?
MR. WELDON:

10

there wouldn't be a cause of

If I may, Justice Scalia,

I'll

11

invoke your concurring opinion in the Franklin case and

12

simply observe that a couple of bridges have been crossed.

13

QUESTION:

No, but I'm saying,

it's -- we're

14

sort of switching the music if, having created the cause

15

of action in the face of its nonexpression, despite the

16

fact that this is a spending thing, we suddenly -- we get

17

very picky,

18

cause of action is.

I suppose, about what the content of that

MR. WELDON:

20

QUESTION:

Well,

I --

Of course, Cannon was decided long

21

before we adopted this rule about Spending Clause

22

certainties.

23

MR. WELDON:

I understand that, but I'd like to

24

point out, as you pointed out in that same concurring

25

opinion,

that Congress then took subsequent action -9

QUESTION:

2

MR. WELDON:

3

-- with the enactment of the civil

rights bill that extended Title IX to the States.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. WELDON:

6

Right.

Quite so.
And I believe that it has to be

taken in the context of the Cannon case.
QUESTION:

7

Oh, I'm not suggesting going back on

8

it, but I'm suggesting that in our -- I'm trying to help

9

you.

Never mind.

10

(Laughter.)

11

QUESTION:

It seems to me an argument in your

12

favor that we've already taken the step, and Congress has

13

accepted it, of creating this cause of action in the teeth

14

of its nonappearance in the statute.
MR. WELDON:

15

And then, of course, the second

16

step was to recognize in Franklin that despite the silence

17

of the statute, which obviously, being implied, would be

18

silent, that the presumption is that all reasonable

19

remedies or usual remedies apply.
QUESTION:

20

May I ask, to the extent to which

21

Title VII would be the model, do you accept that the

22

statutory caps that are in Title VII would apply under

23

Title IX?

24
25

MR. WELDON:

Your Honor, I haven't read the

statute closely, but I think the statute is specific with

1

respect to Title VII.

2

appropriate for Congress to consider whether enacting a

3

statute imposing caps on Title IX precisely the way they

4

have done for Title VII, but I do think -QUESTION:

5

I think it would be entirely

Yes, but it's not there now, and yet

6

this Title IX tells us very little, so we look --we fill

7

in the gaps, I think you suggest, by looking to the law

8

built up under Title VII, so one question was, but you

9

wouldn't take the caps from the statute?

I guess

10

that's -- your answer is no, not unless Congress imposed

11

them.

12

MR. WELDON:

It's obviously a policy

13

consideration, but with all deference I think it's

14

probably --my view is that it's a legislative policy

15

consideration and not a judicial one.

16

QUESTION:

But the judicial -- we -- we have

17

crafted this claim, and so we have to give it some

18

content, too, because where else are we going to look?

19

Congress hasn't done it.

20
21
22

MR. WELDON:

And again, your question is

specifically with regard to caps -QUESTION:

So I - - so I - - well, one thing to do

23

is to say, we'll do this the same way as Title VII, so

24

we'll incorporate the Title VII case law and the Title VII

25

statutory revisions, but you say no.

MR. WELDON:

2

appropriate analogue.

3

least that instinct, I wouldn't call it a holding, by it's

4

reference to the Meritor in the midst of the Franklin

5

case, but I think Title VII is just an analogue and not a

6

direct road map, and I think the reason for that is

7

principally because, first of all -- two things.

I think the Court reflected at

The context of Title IX is significantly

8

9

I think the Title VII cases are an

different than the context of Title VII.

Title IX

10

obviously applies to education from kindergarten or

11

preschool all the way up to post graduate, and the other

12

reason is the text of the statutes are so completely

13

different.

14

QUESTION:

Do we -- do you think we could adopt

15

one standard of liability for the private right of action

16

and permit HHS to use a different standard for the cutting

17

off of funds under Title IX, or do we have to go in

18

lockstep with -- I mean, assuming we're making it up, as

19

Justice Ginsburg suggests, do we have to make it up in

20

lockstep with HHS, or could -- you know -- do you

understand what I'm asking?

of Federal funds under the regulations issued by the

2

Secretary, which the Secretary has authority to issue.

3

MR. WELDON:

4

QUESTION:

That's right.
And the authority has -- the

5

Secretary has no authority to issue regulations about

private causes of action, which we've created.

7

private cause of action have to make the basis of

liability the same thing that the Secretary says is the

basis of cutting off Federal funds?
MR. WELDON:

10
11

I do not think so.

Does our

Frankly, that's

not a question that's concerned me.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. WELDON:

All right -It occurred to me in my

14

preparation, but I do not think so.

15

because I think what would govern the case - - the Court in

16

these decisions is the text of Title IX and the text of

17

the actual regulations, the Code of Federal Regulations

18

that were adopted implementing Title IX as the Department

19

was authorized to do.

20

QUESTION:

I don't think so

So we have to follow those

21

regulations, you say.

it's the basis for liability in the private cause of

action.

1

considerable distinction between the regulations in the

2

Code of Federal Regulations, which are fairly minimal, as

3

compared to the guidelines which are merely intended, I

4

believe, and do not have the same statutory force as the

5

regulations do.

6

The guidelines are a means of educating school

7

districts and helping them implement Title IX, but they do

8

not have the force of law with -- in the same way as these

9

regulations.

10

QUESTION:

Are the school districts bound by the

11

guidelines to the extent that if they don't follow them

12

they can have their funds cut off?

13

MR. WELDON:

I thought they could.

The Government is going to argue

14

that extensively, and I don't want to anticipate the

15

Government's argument too much, and I certainly wouldn't

16

want to disagree with them, but my own personal answer to

17

that would be not necessarily.

18

QUESTION:

Well, you indicated that because of

19

this -- the Spending Clause nature of this act that the

20

municipality or the governmental entity must be aware of

21

the conditions under which its funds might be cut off.

22

MR. WELDON:

23

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
It seems to me, if that's so, that it

24

is very difficult to say that they accepted the funds

2

occurring of which they had no knowledge.
MR. WELDON:

And the principal reason in this

3

case that they did not have any knowledge is that they

4

failed to follow the regulations, which have the force of

5

law, and the regulations required not only the adoption of

6

an antidiscrimination policy, which they have summary

7

judgment establishing that they did, but a complaint

8

procedure and publicizing that complaint procedure to the

9

student body, and that is our principal and primary

10

argument, that by failing to follow that regulation they

11

created for themselves what the Fifth Circuit has now

12

recognized as an absolute defense.

13

QUESTION:

Well, somewhat as in the last case,

14

that this egregious criminal, outrageous conduct,

15

everyone, including the student, would know that the board

16

wouldn't tolerate for a second.

17

MR. WELDON:

That's true, but the testimony in

18

the case was -- from the student, she did not know -- when

19

the approaches by the teacher were merely verbal, in the

20

form of insinuations and suggestions -- he was beginning

21

his concentrated campaign to seduce her.

2

But she's not -- that's not -- the

gravamen of her complaint were not the initial overtures.
MR. WELDON:

3

But if she had known that there was

4

a complaint procedure -- I mean, that was at that point, I

5

would suggest to you, a mild form of sexual discrimination

6

in the form of harassment because of the suggestive nature

7

of the remarks.
If she had known about it she would have

8

9

complained, she said, and if she had complained and

10

effective action had been taken at that point, then her

11

damages would be much different and basically we would not

12

be in court at all, much less here.
QUESTION:

time?

made its best efforts to have as clear a policy and as

2

clear an identification of the person in charge of

3

implementation?

Would that have made any difference?

4

MR. WELDON:

Yes.

It makes a big difference.

5

But I suggest to you -- and here's one of the

6

reasons that it -- that the text, or rather the context of

7

Title IX, the schools dealing with students of all ages,

8

is important -- an important consideration.

9

It would make a big difference the older and

10

more sophisticated the student was toward imposing on her

11

a duty to utilize the complaint procedures, but if you're

12

talking about a 7 or 8-year-old, as, for example, was

13

considered by the Fifth Circuit in the case called

14

Canutillo, then you have obviously completely different

15

considerations.

16

QUESTION:

Well, let's take this case, and she's

17

14 and 15, and they do have -- they've done the best job

18

that they can with putting a policy in place, telling the

19

students about it, telling the teachers about it,

20

identifying the right official to call.

21

MR. WELDON:

And may I also assume in my answer

22

to you that there's no thing so flagrant about the

23

behavior of the teacher and student that a reasonable

24

person would become suspicious.

MR. WELDON:

QUESTION:

Yes.
-- one of the things you said, that

the policy was very fuzzy, nobody knew who to call, or

suppose we make it the best policy.

6

I asked in the last case, does it make any difference?
MR. WELDON:

7

I wanted to know, as

It does make a difference, but

8

because we are talking about 14's and 15-year-olds, I

9

think it makes less of a difference than it might for an

10

adult in the workplace under Title VII.
QUESTION:

11

Well, what's the theory of the

12

difference?

has done all that the employer could do, and therefore it

would be unfair to impose liability on any theory?

MR. WELDON:

QUESTION:

you say it makes a difference,

MR. WELDON:

The other theory, and this would

depend on, again, the factual context.

would depend on whether the sexual discrimination is at

MS. BRINKMANN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I think it's important to focus on the court of
appeals' erroneous restriction in this case of the Court's

1

customary remedial powers that this Court recognized in

2

Franklin to award all appropriate remedies in a case of

3

sexual harassment discrimination under Title IX.

4

The court of appeals here held that damage

5

awards would be appropriate only if a higher-ranking

6

employee knew of the harassment and failed to stop it.

7

The absence of explicit notice by a high-ranking official

8

should not automatically insulate the recipient from

9

liability.

This is particularly true where, as here, the

10

district did not have a policy to prohibit discrimination

11

or a procedure for effective reporting of that.
QUESTION:

12

Why shouldn't we require that the

13

district, in order to be liable, have a policy that

14

permits discrimination, that affirmatively permits it?

15

The way the statute reads, it says no one shall

16

be excluded from participation and be denied the benefits

17

of or be subject to discrimination under any educational

18

program or activity, not in connection with it, under, and

19

I thought it was mainly directed at educational programs

20

that allow sports for boys, no sports for girls, things of

21

that sort.

That is discrimination under the program.

MS. BRINKMANN:

23

QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor, the --

In other words, why shouldn't we

liability is concerned, a policy of discriminating?
MS. BRINKMANN:

2

Your Honor, the differences

3

between Title IX and section 1983 demonstrate that that

4

would not be an appropriate application.

5

foremost, the reasons underlying the 1983 standard,

6

according to this Court's opinions, are rooted in the text

7

of section 1983 and its history, and the text of 1983 says

8

any person who causes another to be -- have their rights

9

violated shall be subject to suit.

First and

This text of Title IX is very different.

10

It is

13

activity, under its programs and activities there cannot

14

sex.

QUESTION:

The same argument was made in 1983

and somehow we've stumbled through.
MS. BRINKMANN:

But Your Honor, in addition to

7

the text of section 1983, which is remarkably different

8

from Title IX, there is also the history, and what led

9

this Court --

10

QUESTION:

I'm unsympathetic to your arguments

11

based on the text of Title IX inasmuch as Title IX doesn't

12

even create a cause of action at all.

13

MS. BRINKMANN:

Well, Your Honor, as my

14

colleague mentioned we've crossed that bridge and, in

15

fact, acts by Congress since then have reinforced the

16

breadth of Title IX and, as you -- your concurrence in

17

Franklin pointed out, Congress enacted a statute to

18

abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity, and there

19

specifically refers to legal remedies.

in an area where we're bound very tightly to the text.

That isn't made up.

2

That's all what we thought

What the Department of Education -QUESTION:

So you're arguing that on these facts

the funds could be revoked for this school district?
MS. BRINKMANN:

Yes, but I have to qualify that

12

there is a statutory requirement placed on the Department

13

of Education to make preliminary steps of voluntary

14

conciliation because of the extreme nature of cutting off

15

funds, and what the Court has recognized is that a private

16

damage remedy stops short of that and also serves another

17

function of Title IX, and that's its remedial purpose.

18

We believe that when there's a violation of

19

Title IX, as this Court said in Franklin, the presumption

20

is that all appropriate remedies apply and there's no

21

basis for restricting courts' authority to do that.

22

And I just want to address the concern about the

23

amount of damages that Justice Ginsburg brought up with

24

that cap under Title VII.

25

First of all, I think it's important to realize

that there are other damages remedies that can be obtained

2

against school districts -- for example, Title VII -- and

3

there is now that cap, and there could certainly be a

4

guidance for courts to look to, but along with the

5

inherent power of courts to order remedies is often the

inherent authority to remit damages.

We also would point out --

QUESTION:

9

Well, Ms. Brinkmann, I'm not sure we

get to that question at all.

This is a spending, funding

program of the Federal Government, and we have indicated

11

that we think when States or local agencies accept money

12

under a spending program it has to be clear what the

conditions are, and what the liabilities would be in

14

accepting that money, and we're struggling in the

15

preceding case with trying to figure out what the

MS. BRINKMANN:

13

Those concerns about admission policies and

14

denying educational benefits, those are referenced in

15

other clauses of Title IX in addition to prohibiting a

16

person from being excluded from participation in, which

17

would be an admission policy that the district level at

the policy level would clearly be carrying out, or denying

someone the benefits of an educational program.

MS. BRINKMANN:

QUESTION:

-- principles for finding --

That's true, as you've indicated with

any corporate or fictional entity, but in this case the

5

whole thrust of Title IX is that there must be a policy or

6

program, and now you're saying that the school can be held

7

liable for something that it knew nothing about.

8

9

It seems to me that this is almost an a fortiori
case, as suggested by Justice Scalia's line of

10

questioning, for a Monell type of requirement that the

11

city or the school district has to have a policy that

12

contradicts this program, and in this case it didn't.

13

MS. BRINKMANN:

Well, Your Honor, the other

14

reason, the only reason that the courts have given, other

15

than the text of section 219(2)(d) for imposing that

16

policy, was the history of the rejection of the Sherman

17

amendment to the 1871 act, and that was -- you're looking

18

at congressional intent and what Congress intended.

19

At the time that Title IX was enacted it could

not possibly have been relying on the Monell standard

MS. BRINKMANN:

9

I think the task of this Court

is to define congressional intent to the best it can, and

10

in Franklin, recognizing the implied cause of action, it

11

looked to the background principles against which Congress

12

enacted Title IX, and that was the presumption of all

appropriate remedies.

14

Congress could certainly take it upon

15

themselves, as they did in other antidiscrimination

16

statutes, to set a cap.

17

That would be a policy matter.

Would it depend, for example, on the number of

employees, as the cap under Title VII does, or the amount

19

of funds that the school receives, or the amount of -- the

20

size of the student population?

law.
MR. JEFFERSON:

Oh, no.

No.

No, because it's

not a violation of Title IX to begin with.

Do you know practically how often the

cut-off of funding has been used as distinguished from

to another point of the Spending Clause legislation.

MR. JEFFERSON:

Yes, that's correct, Your Honor.

MR. JEFFERSON:

-- in the public record in that

year, in 1992-'93, the entire budget was only about $1.6

QUESTION:

15

One answer possibly to the Spending

Clause argument is that until there was some kind of an

17

adjudication you didn't know that there would necessarily

18

be a private cause of action.

19

that.

20

liability would necessarily give rise to liability, what

22

kind of primary action would give rise to liability.

I think everybody accepts

Until there was some kind of an adjudication the

Well, I can agree with that.

10

employment, you know, the corporation acts through its

11

employees, the district acts through its employees, and

This saves your case very well, but

12

what you're saying with that test is that in the next

case, when one coteacher knew about it, that's enough.

14

MR. JEFFERSON:

No, because I think that the --

knowledge to the district.

QUESTION:

Why?

The district has to act through

its agents, you said.

MR. JEFFERSON:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. JEFFERSON:

Well --

And the coteacher's an agent.
It does, but in order to hold

22

the district liable you've got to show that the

district -- in Franklin, the principal knew.

24

25

to get this information to the principal.

Do you concede that we use agency

Court should declare that that's not the test.

12

liability is not the test and could not be the test, and

It seems to me your opponent argued, or the

regulations because it didn't have an adequate policy in

Yes.

Some did.
Yes.

Now, what's your response to - - say

you have a defense after the regulations went into effect.

20

What is your defense under the argument that I repeated to

21

the pre-regulation conduct.

22

MR. JEFFERSON:

Before the regulations went into

23

effect we had a policy of nondiscrimination, which is what

24

Title IX requires, which was disseminated to the students.

Franklin, the world changed.
QUESTION:

3

But did that pre-Franklin policy

comply with the Federal regulations?
MR. JEFFERSON:

4

I -- you know, I think there

5

was -- technically the answer is probably not, because it

6

doesn't say within 5 days you must report it, you know, a

7

reported violation has to be, you know, submitted to a

8

committee, and within

9

policy was not in place.
QUESTION:

10

0 days a decision, so that sort of

Then how relevant, if it is the fact

11

that during a portion of the period there was a failure to

12

comply with Federal regulations, how relevant, if at all,

3

is that to the problem before us?

4

MR. JEFFERSON:

I don't think it's -- I don't

5

think it's relevant and again, I must -- the reason that I

6

mentioned what the petitioner's knowledge was was because

7

a policy in this case would have made absolutely no

8

difference.

QUESTION:

Oh, I see.

It's the causality

element.
MR. JEFFERSON:

There is a causality element,

that's right, in this case.
QUESTION:

Had that policy made a difference,

24

though, you agree that not having that policy in place

25

would automatically make you liable?

MR. JEFFERSON:

2

QUESTION:

No.

I do not agree with that.

Well, you said before that you

3

thought we had to apply the same standards for a violation

4

of the funding regulations as we must apply for liability

5

under the personal actions.

6

MR. JEFFERSON:

7

QUESTION:

Well, because the --

Do you believe that or not?

If so,

8

when you violate the regulation you are automatically

9

subject to suit and the only question is one of causality,

10
11

which will usually have to go to the jury, I assume.
MR. JEFFERSON:

But then the question there

12

would be funding, but it wouldn't be the -- it wouldn't be

13

bound up with the private cause of action for the

14

petitioner in this case.

15

Yes, there could be a cessation of funding.

16

don't think it would happen.

17

they're going to give -- the agency's going to give the

18

district a chance of --

QUESTION:

I

I think in the real world

But it would be a jury question,

wouldn't it, whether -- whether the --

21

MR. JEFFERSON:

22

QUESTION:

The jury --

-- failure to have the 5, 10-day,

23

whatever it is, was a cause of the injury here, and if it

24

was you'd be liable.

MR. JEFFERSON:

Number 1, I don't think the jury

would get this question to begin with --

2

QUESTION:

Oh.

3

MR. JEFFERSON:

-- and number 2, I don't think

4

that the absence of a policy would make the district here

5

liable for the criminal conduct of a teacher that the

6

district knew nothing about.

7

QUESTION:

Well, then you're saying you don't

8

really think that we should apply the same standard for

9

the cut-off of funding that we apply for personal

10

liability, or for --

11

MR. JEFFERSON:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. JEFFERSON:

Well --

-- you know, monetary liability.
Well, except your -- the

14

question to me doesn't -- doesn't get into what happened

15

here in this case.

There'd be negotiation.
That's correct.

wouldn't want the same standard for the two, it seems to

2

me.

MR. JEFFERSON:

QUESTION:

5
6

I --

The one is optional.

The other,

you're socked with a lawsuit, with no choice.
MR. JEFFERSON:

I take your point.

I mean, and

7

it's true, the -- there is the possibility of compliance

8

under Title IX.

9

if, as in Franklin, the complaint is made and the district

10
11

If there's -- you know, it would be as

does nothing about it.
If, under Title IX, the district is apprised of

12

its noncompliance and does nothing about it, well then the

13

severe sanction, you know, withdrawal of funding, would be

14

appropriate.

15

in that situation is the district would come into

16

compliance or would just decide, no longer do we need

17

Federal funds.

18

But of course, you know, what would happen

I mean, it would be their option.

And so again, I think under the facts of this

19

case the -- here, the absence of a policy makes no

20

difference whatsoever.

21

Now, the other thing we need to talk about is,

22

was this actually sexual discrimination under a policy, or

23

under a program or an activity, and again, we say, and I'm

24

mirroring some of the comments made in the argument

25

before, no.

What happened here was a teacher who, to all

2

intents and purposes was a good teacher, but who did a

3

criminal act, who engaged himself in an act that was

4

private, that was prurient, that was criminal, that could

5

land him in jail and did land him in jail.

6

any way associated with any education program or activity.

7

That is not in

Now, what counsel say on this side is, well,

8

you've got this sort of -- you've got this sort of program

9

and it's got to be implemented by agents, and the agent

10

here was a teacher, and so therefore there's liability.

11

But if we do go back to Title IX and the

12

congressional intent, when you look at Title IX, what

13

they're talking about, Mr. Chief Justice, as you

14

mentioned, is things like discrimination in funding of

15

sports, or employment discrimination, you know, after a

16

decision in this Court.

17

That sort of thing, which is always carried out

18

by agents who have the discretion to hire and fire or to

19

fund or not to fund, it's always someone who has the sort

20

of authority that we're talking about who needs to be

21

there before you can hold the district liable.

22

What happened, and what makes this case odd, is

23

Franklin, and Cannon before it, you know, adopting a whole

24

private cause of action and then this Court becoming in

25

effect a legislature.

We keep coming back to the Court

for new rules and new regulations -- well, what about

2

this, Your Honor, and what about that, Your Honor --

3

because now the Court is sitting as Congress should have

4

sat before, if it wanted to find this cause of action,

5

this private cause of action.

6

The sort of agent that they contend is making

7

the district liable is not proper, because the agent here

8

is engaging in purely criminal activity.

If there are no further questions, we would ask
that the Court affirm the judgment of the Fifth Circuit.
