CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Frederick.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
This case concerns whether police officers must

11

have a higher justification than reasonable suspicion if

12

they damage property while making a no-knock entry to

13

execute a search warrant.

14

The officers here sought to apprehend an escaped

15

convict who had committed numerous violent acts and had

16

stated that he would never return to prison.

17

executing a no-knock entry at respondent's house to

18

execute a search warrant to look for that fugitive, the

19

officers broke a single garage door windowpane.

20

that property damage, the Ninth Circuit held that the

21

officers must have a higher justification for foregoing

22

with the general principle of knock and announcement.

And another preliminary matter.

Do

6

you accept the notion that the Fourth Amendment does

7

impose some kind of restraints on the amount of force that

8

officers can use in effecting a no-knock entry?

9

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes,

Justice O'Connor.

The two

10

questions are distinct, in our view.

11

reasonable suspicion to forego knocking and announcing,

12

they may use the force reasonably necessary to effectuate

13

the entry.

If the officers have

A case of excessive or wholly needless property

15

damage would be assessed under a reasonableness standard

16

that took into account whether or not it was actually

reasonable to go through the door or to go through the

window, or to engage in some other property damage.

MR. FREDERICK:

2

QUESTION:

Yes, to conduct the search or --

Your argument here would be the same

3

if there were no warrant but the police had probable

4

cause, would it not?

5

MR. FREDERICK:

Our answer is the same with

6

respect to the no-knock clause of the warrant, Justice

7

Kennedy, if that is what your question is getting at.

8

officers here had probable cause to search the premises.

9
10

QUESTION:

The

I understand.

MR. FREDERICK:

And the magistrate put a no­

11

knock provision in the warrant.

12

officers executed the entry, they had reasonable suspicion

13

to believe that they would face danger if they knocked and

14

announced, so if I understand --

15

QUESTION:

Our view is that when the

But you would -- the -- you would

16

make the same argument here whether or not the no-knock

17

waiver was in the warrant or not?

18

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.

Yes.

As the Court made

19

clear in Richards, the question is whether the officers'

20

reasonable suspicion at the time they make the entry.

21

There may be circumstances that dissipate that

22

reasonable suspicion if the officers have gone to the

23

magistrate, the magistrate authorizes a no-knock entry,

24

and what the Court made clear in Richards is that if those

25

circumstances dissipate the reasonable suspicion, it would

1

not be reasonable for the officers to forego knocking and

2

announcing, notwithstanding that the warrant contained a

3

no-knock clause.

4

As the Court made clear in Richards, reasonable

5

suspicion is the standard by which to judge foregoing with

6

knocking and announcing.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Frederick, may I go back to the

8

question that was -- I think Justice O'Connor asked you,

9

and that is, you said that there could be a Fourth

0

Amendment control of excessive force.

11

What would be the

implementation of that?
Suppose the agents here had come in like

12

3

gangbusters and destroyed everything in their path, and

4

also picked up some incriminating evidence, what would be

5

the consequences?

6

You said the Fourth Amendment is involved, how?

7

Do we exclude the evidence that would be garnered in such

8

an unreasonable search?

9

MR. FREDERICK:

I think your question poses two

20

distinct points, and let me address them separately, if I

21

may.

22

The reasonableness of the method of making the

23

entry would be assessed by looking at what force was

24

necessary to get in quickly.

25

The remedy that might occur if the officers

1

engaged in excessive property damage, we submit, would be

2

compensation for the damaged property and not necessarily

3

the exclusion of the evidence, for if the officers had

4

properly made a no-knock entry supported by reasonable

5

suspicion but not engaged in the unnecessary property

6

damage, they still would have found the same evidence, and

7

they would have found the same evidence at the same time,

8

so the remedy that would be appropriate in the case of

9

needless property damage would be compensation and not the

10

imposition of the exclusionary rule.
QUESTION:

11

But supposing there is authority,

12

though, and there's no Fourth Amendment violation, and

13

they break the door down of a third party, don't they have

14

to pay for the damage?

15

MR. FREDERICK:

16

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice --

So the obligation to pay for the

17

damage isn't dependent at all on whether it was justified

18

or not.

19

MR. FREDERICK:

No, Justice Stevens.

In fact,

20

the statute that you may be referring to is 31 U.S.C. 3724

21

provides -- Congress has provided that where a law

22

enforcement activity has resulted in property damage to an

23

innocent third party, the Attorney General can pay

24

compensation for that law enforcement activity.

25

That would not necessarily be the case for a

criminal wrongdoer.

the part of the Government to pay for property damage that

3

occurred for a wrongdoer, so -QUESTION:

4

There would not be an obligation on

Well, it would -- is this person --

at the time of the entry, this -- the property owner was

not a wrongdoer.

7

some stuff in the house, but -MR. FREDERICK:

8

9
10

Of course, you found out later he had

That's correct.

I mean, the

officers are always operating on the information that they
have when they make the entry.
The question, you know, to be clear, is that if

11
12

the officers have reasonable suspicion to believe that

13

there would be a danger if they knocked and announced,

14

that carries with it the authority to make whatever

15

property damage is reasonably necessary to effectuate that

16

entry.

17

The case that Justice Ginsburg posits is where

18

the officers have engaged in wholly needless property

19

damage that's unrelated to --

20

QUESTION:

21

of property damage?

22

What did the officers do here by way

MR. FREDERICK:

They broke a single garage door

23

windowpane, Mr. Chief Justice, and they did so because

24

they had information from a confidential, reliable

25

informant that guns were kept in the garage, or that they

1

might be kept in the garage, and the purpose of making

2

that break in the garage door windowpane was so that an

3

officer could secure the garage in the event that the

4

people in the house went to the garage to get the guns.
QUESTION:

5

Mr. Frederick, I am less concerned

6

about -- well, just as concerned, I suppose, but I am less

7

troubled by what the Fourth Amendment might provide than I

8

am by section 3109, which says the officer may break open

9

any outer or inner door or window or any part of the

10

house, or anything therein, to execute a search warrant

11

if, after notice of his authority and purpose, he is

12

refused admittance, which didn't occur here, or when

13

necessary to liberate himself or a person aiding him in

14

the execution of the warrant, which didn't occur here.

15

I don't see what the purpose of that statute is

16

unless it is meant to exclude other break-ins, which isn't

17

to say that the other break-ins would exclude all the

18

evidence that's found, and I assume that your answer to

19

what would happen if there's a violation of 3109 is the

20

same thing as your answer to what happens if you use

21

excessive force, right?
MR. FREDERICK:

22

23
24
25

Yes, it would be, Justice

Scalia.

caused.

2

MR. FREDERICK:

3

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Okay.

Well, why shouldn't I read

4

3 09 that way, saying these are the only -- these are the

5

only reasons why a Federal officer can break anything in a

6

house?

7

MR. FREDERICK:

For two reasons.

8

that for 40 years this Court,

9

States in

The first is

starting in Miller v. United

958, has read the language of 3 09 which we

10

have set forth in our opening brief at page 2, to

11

essentially codify the common law rule of knock and

12

announcement and its exceptions.

3
4

QUESTION:

Well, it -- but it clearly doesn't,

unless you're wrong about what the common law allows.

5

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, our view, Justice Scalia,

6

is that the Court has never construed the terms of this

7

statute literally.

8
9

QUESTION:

It read into -I see.

We've never construed it to

mean what it says.

20

MR. FREDERICK:

Absolutely.

That's correct, and

21

if you were to start -- if you were to start reading this

22

language literally, there are several decisions that would

23

have to overruled.

24

a requirement that knock and announce be done for arrest

25

warrants.

Miller v. United States read into this

It read into the statute an exclusionary rule.

In Sabbath this Court read into the statute a

1

2

requirement that not -- force did not have to be used,

3

notwithstanding that it says, may break open, so the Court

4

has read this language and has stated several times that

5

the language is to be understood against the backdrop of

6

principles of common law that have been in effect for

7

hundreds of years, and that the language is not to be read

8

literally, and our view is that there's no reason at this

9

point to go back to a literal, textual reading of section

10

3109 when the Court has never -QUESTION:

11
12

that?

What effect does 3109 have if we do

Is it just a superfluous statute?

13

MR. FREDERICK:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

Well, the --

Just sort of there to say, you don't

really mean just this, do whatever you like?
MR. FREDERICK:

No.

The language is an

17

expression of congressional policy that Federal officers

18

should conduct their entries by using the general

19

principle of knock and announcement unless there are

20

reasons that would just -- be justified in not doing so.

21

QUESTION:

It doesn't say that.

22

MR. FREDERICK:

23

QUESTION:

I understand, Justice Scalia.

Does it do anything other than what

24

our decision says the Fourth Amendment does with respect

25

to the States?

MR. FREDERICK:

1

Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg,

2

the answer to your question is that -- first, our position

3

is that the statute is coextensive with the Fourth

4

Amendment requirements, so that the requirements on

5

Federal law enforcement officers are no greater or lesser

6

than they are on State officers as prescribed under the

7

Fourth Amendment's reasonableness provision.
QUESTION:

8

9
10

So then you really don't -- this is

just kind of a statement that doesn't matter, because the
Fourth Amendment certainly binds Federal officers.
MR. FREDERICK:

11

That's true.

As a matter of

12

history, the language in the statute came well before the

13

Supreme Court began to interpret the Fourth Amendment's

14

reasonableness requirement to impose a knock and announce

15

requirement constitutionally, so as a matter of history

16

there is a reason for section 3109.

17

It's just that as it has been construed by this

18

Court, the statute itself does not impose a higher

19

requirement on Federal officers than it would on State

20

officers, who are in the dangerous situation of executing

21

warrants.

22

In fact, all Federal courts of appeals,

23

including the Ninth Circuit, have recognized an exception

24

for officer safety under section 3109, notwithstanding

25

that the textual language does not contain such an

1

exception.
QUESTION:

2

We're talking about whether you have

3

to pay for the window or the door.

4

talking about letting the culprit skip away under the

5

exclusionary rule if this provision has been violated.
MR. FREDERICK:

6

7

I'm sorry, I don't understand

the question.
QUESTION:

8

9

I mean, you're not

If the provision -- I mean, I don't

know that there is such a massive importance in

10

interpreting 3109 so broadly, because if it has been

11

violated, the only consequence is that the window has to

12

be paid for, or the door that's broken down has to be paid

13

for.

14

MR. FREDERICK:

That would certainly be our view

15

if the Court were not to accept its prior cases, which

16

hold that the common law rule of knock and announcement

17

has been, in effect, codified by section 3109.

18

I'd like to emphasize two other points.

19

QUESTION:

Let me ask you one question.

Did the

20

Sabbath case take any position on whether there might be

21

an exclusionary rule in connection with the violation of

22

3109?

23

MR. FREDERICK:

I -- yes, I -- although I'm -- I

24

actually don't recall, Justice Scalia.

25

this Court noted in --

I think that as

SUITE 400

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

QUESTION:

1

Well, no -- I see now in the first

2

paragraph it says, we hold the method of entry vitiated

3

the arrest and therefore that evidence seized in the

4

subsequent search should not have been admitted at

5

petitioner's trial.

6

MR. FREDERICK:

7

QUESTION:

Yes.

So that if we say this violates 3109,

8

unless we do something to Sabbath you get an exclusionary

9

rule right along with it.
MR. FREDERICK:

10

That's correct, and in Sabbath

11

itself the Court read the words forcibly break essentially

12

out of this statute, because the facts there were that the

13

officer entered an unlocked door.

14
15

I would like to underscore that the Ninth
Circuit's teaching --

16

QUESTION:

That wasn't a holding of the case, of

17

course.

18

an assumption which never had to be applied.

19

That wasn't a holding of the case.

QUESTION:

It was just

Oh, I don't think that they reversed

20

the judgment of the lower court.

This -- you know, the

They didn't exclude the evidence --

QUESTION:

They said in the first paragraph the

24

evidence will have to be excluded.

1

to do something with 3109 it would have to encounter its

2

prior decisions in Miller and in Sabbath with respect to

3

questions such as whether it goes beyond the common law in

4

terms of restricting this --

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. FREDERICK:

7

Where did it come from --- with respect to the

exclusionary rule.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. FREDERICK:
QUESTION:

10

3109 doesn't forbid anything.
That's correct, Justice Breyer.

All right.

So it must -- it says it

11

came from the field code in New York in 1880, or

12

something, and so at that time they must have think --

13

thought there was some different rule of law that forbids

14

something, and then they said, despite that different rule

15

of law, this permits something.

16
17

How did it work?
you know?

18

What were they thinking, do

You may not know -MR. FREDERICK:

Well, as the law of knock and

19

announce developed, it developed in the law of civil

20

trespass where property owners brought trespass actions

21

against law enforcement officers for unlawfully entering

22

premises.

23

Now, the legislative history, even into the New

24

York statute, is not clear as to why the New York drafters

25

of their statutes put it into the law, but one theory

1

might be that the -- New York and in Congress wanted to

2

create an affirmative grant of authority to officers so

3

that they could avoid trespass actions.

4

But that's just speculation on our part, because

5

there is -- the historical evidence simply is not clear as

6

to why certain aspects of the common law of knock and

7

announcement were specifically written into 3 09 and

8

others that had been well-recognized, including officer

9

safety, from the

822 decision of Reed v. Case, were not,

10

so I think that it would be pure speculation as to exactly

11

why an affirmative grant was placed into the statutory

12

provisions, Justice Breyer.
Let me point out that the Ninth Circuit's two-

3
4

tier rule places an unreasonable burden on law enforcement

5

officers.

6

to property.

No-knock entries routinely involve some damage

In the Richards case, for instance, the officers

7
8

had to ram the door and kick it in in order to make the

9

entry.

If officers need more than reasonable suspicion to

20

justify a no-knock entry involving property damage, they

21

may have to face the choices of having evidence suppressed

22

at trial or facing greater personal risks when knocking

23

and announcement.

24

be forced to make that kind of calculus at a dangerous

25

situation such as executing warrants.

We submit that the officer should not

1

Moreover, the Ninth Circuit's approach provides

2

no practical guidance to officers.

Warrant execution

3

entails high risks and requires split-second judgments.

4

It is unclear what level of information will meet the

5

higher tier of specificity required by the Ninth Circuit.

6

The level of justification for a no-knock entry

7

should not turn on the fortuity of the officers

8

encountering an unlocked door or window.

9

suspicion justifies the property damage that is reasonably

Reasonable, just

10

necessary to effectuate that entry and, in fact, if the

11

Ninth Circuit's rule is accepted by this Court that

12

something more than reasonable suspicion is necessary if

13

2

saying with respect to that question, Justice Kennedy, and

3

we petitioned for certiorari for the express purpose of

4

having this Court say that the two-tier rule was not the

rule that should govern in cases of property damage.
QUESTION:

But in the course of saying that, it

seems to me that we will still -- we would still say, if

8

we agreed with you, that the ultimate standard is

reasonableness, that the -- you cannot destroy more

10

property than is reasonably necessary, given all of the

11

circumstances and given the necessity to protect your

12

officers.

13

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct, Justice Kennedy,

14

but I hope that, when you do write that opinion saying

15

that, you distinguish between the reasons that the

16

officers have for foregoing with knocking and announcement

17

and the reasons that they have for the particular method

18

of getting into the premises.

19

A fortified door that is barricaded, has steel

20

reinforcements, will require a different tactical method

21

than a door that is a screen door, that may be wide open.

22

Our view is that reasonable suspicion justifies getting

23

the officers inside the premises as quickly as possible.

24

How they go about doing that, though, is going to turn on

25

the reasonableness of the fortifications that they

QUESTION:

Exactly.

It should not be the

of the fruits of their activity to fortify their homes,

14

which would there -- or premises, and thereby lead to

15

greater property destruction if officers have reasonable

suspicion to make a no-knock entry, should entitle them to

greater Fourth Amendment protection than people who do not

engage in such fortifications.

What -- and our view is that those two questions

should be decoupled so that it is clear to all that

MR. LEVINE:

1

The statement in Richards v.

2

Wisconsin, the test of reasonable suspicion that the

3

Government talks about and that this Court talked about,

4

though, in the context of destruction of evidence, that

5

has to be construed at least with regard to a planned

6

assault on a residence, as opposed to a spontaneous

7

happening at the door, that has to be construed, it seems

8

to me, to include the manner of entry and the degree of

9

danger.

10

It's like Tennessee v. Garner.

The Government

11

just wants to have a quantum reasonable suspicion, but

12

that's not what you did in Tennessee v. Garner.

13

the case where you said the police officer couldn't shoot

14

the fleeting felon.

15

the fleeing of the -- the death of the felon.

16

That was

You have to consider the end result,

In Winston v. Lee, which Garner cites, you

17

recall that was the case where the police wanted to compel

18

surgery to remove a bullet from the suspected robber, and

19

they said they need to get the bullet, and this Court said

20

quite clearly that, wait a minute, what's the danger if we

21

remove the bullet?

22

Government's interest in getting the bullet?

23

the bullet was only half an inch, and they said, well,

24

that's okay, go ahead, but then it turned out the bullet

25

was a lot closer, this person might die.

We have to balance that.

Whren, I believe last term, you said that there's a

Your Honors,

8 United -- oh, this case, of

2

course, is a Federal case, so we are also controlled by

3

the Federal no-knock statute,

4

section 3 09, and if the Court should decide -- actually,

5

the Court doesn't even have to reach the constitutional

6

question if it decides my way on the statute.

7

8 United States Code

Now, under the plain meaning of the statute, as

8

was pointed out earlier, no-knock -- knock and announce

9

was required.

If you compare the, as a matter of fact,

10

the statute with the New York statute that it was based

11

on, which can be found in, Your Honors, at page 44 of my

12

brief -- page 44 of my brief, if you look at the statute

3

that was enacted as part of the field code, you can see

4

that the Federal statute tracks verbatim the New York

5

statute, except for the last sentence.

6

Now, the last sentence, we see Congress is

7

changing the New York statute.

It adds on the statement

8

that officers can also -- another exception is to go in

9

and rescue, or liberate, as they say, a person who's

20

trapped in the house, so we have Congress, Congress making

21

a specific decision to enact specific exceptions.

22

They enacted this one particular exception to

23

liberate, which comes from a common law case, I believe in

24

6 9, the Wilshire case, which Justice Thomas cited in his

25

opinion for the Court in Wilson.

That's where a bailiff

was trapped in the house and the other bailiffs had to go

in and rescue him.

argument that Congress knows exactly what it's doing.

This is officer safety.

Mr. Frederick, may I ask you this

you know, I can understand the Government's

feeling that on the facts this case shouldn't have come

out this way, and that was also what the dissenting

12

opinion of Judge Kozinski said, but he didn't say that you

cannot take into account -- he didn't criticize the

And let me explain why.

If the

wall is barricaded and a person has put fortifications up

so that a reasonable means of entry entails taking the

19

wall out, that would be judged separately from the

20

justifications that the officers have for fearing their

21

safety.

22

That's -- the Court has long held that the

manner of the search can be treated distinct from the

justifications that the officers have for getting probable

25

cause for a warrant, for example.

Why --
