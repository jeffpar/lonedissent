ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY B. DYK

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DYK:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
In 1994, the petitioner employer and the

12

13

respondent union in this case engaged in collective

14

bargaining required by the National Labor Relations Act

15

and by the decisions of the National Labor Relations

16

Board.

17

And the union alleges that in the course of that

18

bargaining the employer failed to supply information that

19

it was obligated to supply concerning subcontracting

20

plans, one of the questions being whether that was a

21

mandatory or permissive subject of bargaining under the

22

act.

23

And the union first brought its claim before the

24

National Labor Relations Board alleging that the employer

25

had committed an unfair labor practice by failing to

1

bargain in good faith under sections 8(a)(5) and 8(d) of

2

the act.

3

And apparently dissatisfied with the progress of

4

this complaint before the board, the union then brought an

5

identical action, making exactly the same charges, seeking

6

virtually the same relief, in Federal district court as a

7

declaratory judgment action, purportedly pursuant to

8

section 301 of the National Labor Relations Act, and the

9

board proceeding has been tentatively settled.

10

A settlement was approved by the regional

11

director last week, and the board has granted limited

12

relief, ordering that certain provisions of the contract

13

be set aside and awarding back pay but refusing to grant

14

the broad relief that the union had requested, which would

15

be invalidation of the entire contract.

16

18

QUESTION:

May I ask a preliminary question?

The contract has expired?
MR. DYK:

The contract has expired and the

19

parties are in the process of attempting to negotiate a

20

new agreement.

relief granted.

2

for us?

3

Why should -- why is there anything left

MR. DYK:

Well, we think that the matter should

4

have been resolved by the board proceedings, but as far as

5

the mootness of the court proceeding is concerned the

6

union still claims damages based on the identical facts

7

that led it to request the declaratory judgment and that

8

issue would be unaffected, in the union's view, by the

9

board's settlement.

10

QUESTION:

Well, didn't the collective

11

bargaining agreement also provide for the payment of

12

survivor's benefits for a certain number of years after

13

the contract expired?

14

MR. DYK:

There are a variety of issues which

15

could arise under the collective bargaining agreement

16

because, of course, the effect of that agreement wasn't

17

limited to the 3-year period of the agreement, so for all

18

of these reasons we think there's no real issue of

19

mootness in this case.

20

Rather, the issue here is whether the district

21

court had jurisdiction under section 301 and, in our view,

22

the language of section 301 is quite plain.

23

for suits for violation of collective bargaining

24

agreements.

25

There's no allegation that the employer has committed a

It provides

There's no question here of any violation.

violation of the
QUESTION:

2

But Mr. Dyk, you concede if it came

3

up defensively it would properly be a matter for the

4

court.

5

the union's answer to that is, this whole contract is no

6

good because it was induced by fraud.

Say the union violated the no-strike clause and

MR. DYK:

7

Well, Justice Ginsburg, yes, we do

8

agree that if there had been an alleged violation of the

9

agreement and a declaratory judgment were sought, that

10

there had been no violation, that that would be a matter

11

properly within the district court's jurisdiction.

12

course, all the parties agree here that in the course of

13

that proceeding the law that would be applied would be

14

board law, in other words, the good faith bargaining

15

requirements crafted by the board pursuant to the act,

so - -

QUESTION:

Of

But nonetheless there's nothing about

18

the issue that identifies it as an issue only for the

19

board and never for the courts.

20

MR. DYK:

That's correct, and what this Court

21

has done, as we understand it, it has said that pursuant

22

to the act, that you can have an affirmative suit that's

23

brought in the courts or an unfair labor practice charge

24

before the board that may involve defenses, defenses

1

courts concerning the interpretation of the act, and that

2

has been brought up in cases like Kaiser Steel.

3

But the courts have -- this Court has recognized

4

a distinction between bringing something as an affirmative

5

matter and bringing it as a defensive matter.

6

example, in Communications Workers v. Beck, which was not

7

a case exactly like this but it involved the duty of fair

8

representation, this Court held that the employer's

9

alleged violation of 8(a)(3) of the act could be raised as

For

10

a defense to the claim, but that an 8(a)(3) claim could

11

not be asserted at the outset in Federal court, and

12

there's a good reason -QUESTION:

13

But Mr. Dyk, isn't it the whole

14

purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act to enable you to

15

anticipate your defenses instead of having to wait for a

16

lawsuit by the other side?
Isn't the whole purpose of it to enable the

17
18

union, for example, in this case to come into court and

19

say, we do not intend to live up to this agreement.

20

going to strike, and we think we have a right to strike

because the agreement is invalidated by the fraud at the

22

beginning, and we want a declaratory judgment to that

effect.

1

classic declaratory judgment action in the sense that this

2

Court has held repeatedly in the Franchise Tax Board case,

3

in Skelly Oil and a number of others, that the Declaratory

4

Judgment Act can't expand the jurisdiction of the Federal

5

court.

all, is it?

has jurisdiction.

It's just a procedural device where a court

MR. DYK:

9

It isn't a grant of jurisdiction at

Correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

Now, if

10

the court had jurisdiction because there had been a

11

violation of the act and there was a controversy over

12

whether there had been a violation of the act, of course

13

there would be jurisdiction under 301(c).

QUESTION:

The declaration judgment says the

There's never a claim that has

It's always

Are you saying that they just didn't use the

5

right words, that the union should have come in and said,

6

we are about to strike and we want a declaratory judgment

that this will not be a violation of the act.

MR. DYK:

QUESTION:
MR. DYK:

10

Well, they -Would that have been okay?
If they said we are about to strike

11

and we'd like a declaration, that would not be this case.

I would think that if it got to the point of being an

anticipatory repudiation similar to Dowd Box --

QUESTION:

20

MR. DYK:

Okay.
There has been no violation, no

alleged violation, and we suggest that when Congress said

suits for violation it was very clear that there had to be

1

that at some future time if they chose to do it they could

2

engage in a strike which otherwise might be in violation

3

of the contract, so there was no present controversy about

4

a violation or even an anticipated violation of the

5

agreement.
QUESTION:

6

Can you -- can the -- suppose the

7

employer says to the union representative, if you go out

8

on strike, I will sue you for breaching this contract.

9

says that.
So the union representative says, I would like a

10
11

declaration that you have no lawsuit.

12

Can he do that in a declaratory judgment action?
MR. DYK:

13
14

He

He brings the suit.

I think there are certainly some

circumstances where -QUESTION:

15

Well, let's say the circumstance is

16

a) my basis as union representative is I think you have to

17

have an offer and an acceptance to have a contract and

18

here there was no offer, or there was no acceptance.
MR. DYK:

19
20

If the dispute is over a violation of

the agreement, yes -QUESTION:

21

No.

The dispute is -- this is the

22

dispute.

The employer says, if you go out on strike, I

23

will sue you.

24

Why?

25

or alternatively there was no acceptance.

The union says, if you sue, you will lose.

Because there is no contract.

There was no offer,

QUESTION:

7

Fine, says

What about the circumstances I just

mentioned?
MR. DYK:

No, I'm suggesting, under the

circumstances you just mentioned, you could imagine, yes,
10
11

that there would be section 301 jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

Yes, all right.

If the answer to

12

that is yes, now we have exactly the same dialogue but

13

substitute for the words, offer and acceptance, the reason

14

your contract is not valid is it was obtained by fraud.

15

MR. DYK:

16

the basis for the claim is.

17

QUESTION:

Well, it isn't the question of what

No, the reason that you cannot sue me

18

for a breach of contract is because the contract doesn't

1

exist, and the reason it doesn't exist is because it was

20

obtained by fraud.

21

MR. DYK:

Justice Breyer, I agree that there may

22

be circumstances in which something has gotten to the

23

point where there is a real dispute about whether there

24

would be a violation of the contract which possibly could

25

be brought into Federal court.

This isn't that situation.

1

What this situation is, where you have an

2

exactly parallel proceeding in district court and what you

3

have is an effort in essence to bring unfair labor

4

practice charges into court rather than to bring them

5

before the board, and Congress when it enacted section 301

6

could not have possibly contemplated that.

7

Indeed, the legislative history shows quite

8

clearly that Congress was very concerned about overlapping

9

affirmative jurisdiction between the board and the courts,

10

and they said that one of the provisions of the original

11

Taft-Hartley Act would have given the board jurisdiction

12

to determine compliance with contracts.

13

QUESTION:

Well, in Justice Breyer's first

14

hypothetical, could the offer and acceptance dispute have

15

been remitted to the board?

16

MR. DYK:

17
18

The offer and acceptance dispute could

have been remitted to the board.
QUESTION:

Why wouldn't there be concurrent

19

jurisdiction, or conflicting jurisdiction in that case

20

just as well as here?

21

MR. DYK:

In some circumstances conflicting

22

jurisdiction is tolerated and will exist.

The problem is

23

that if you are allowed to bring this kind of proceeding,

24

this kind of abstract proceeding before there has been a

25

real dispute about whether the contract was violated, what

1

you would be doing is to in essence say, virtually any

2

unfair labor practice charge can be framed as a

3

declaratory judgment matter to be brought into court.

4

Anything having to do with the collective

5

bargaining, the obligation to bargain in good faith could

6

be brought into court on the theory that there might be in

7

some future time a dispute about the ability to strike

8

under the contract.

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Dyk, may I just ask this.

You

10

say anything covers -- is it not correct, at least the

11

union says in their brief that you took the position

12

before the board that this fraud was not a mandatory

13

subject of bargaining and therefore was not subject to

14

review by the board.

15

MR. DYK:

Well, that's correct, Justice Stevens,

16

and I think that's exactly why this matter belongs before

17

the board, because of course the distinction between

18

mandatory and permissive subjects of bargaining under this

19

Court's decision in First National Maintenance is a very

20

difficult line to draw, one that the board has struggled

21

with again and again over the years, and if it's a

22

mandatory subject of bargaining there is the obligation to

23

supply the information to the union, but if it is a

24

permissive subject of bargaining the obligation does not

25

exist to supply the information to the union.

QUESTION:

1

Well, why do we have to decide that

2

it belongs somewhere else?

3

whether or not it fits the definition of whether this is

4

an action for violation of a contract and if it isn't

5

that, it doesn't belong in court.
Maybe it belongs before the board, maybe it

6

7
8

10

All we have to decide here is

doesn't.
MR. DYK:

That's exactly correct, Mr. Chief

Justice, and we suggest that -QUESTION:

Yes, but you have argued that the

11

better forum is the board, and that argument kind of falls

12

apart if the forum isn't there.

13

MR. DYK:

No, no, but Justice Stevens, it's

14

exactly because of the difficult distinctions between

15

mandatory --

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. DYK:

Right.
-- and permissive subjects of

18

bargaining that this case belongs before the board.

19

board ought to be deciding whether there was an obligation

20

to supply the information or not supply the information.

21

That turns on whether it was a mandatory or permissive

22

subject of bargaining.

25

The

The courts are ill-equipped to make that kind of
determination.

That's something that --

would be no remedy for the fraud?

MR. DYK:

No, absolutely not.

I think there are

Which under Truett -Which they alleged.
That would apply to mandatory and

permissive subjects of bargaining.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. DYK:

Right.
But the main part of the charge here

13

is that there was a request for information, that we

14

didn't supply the information.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. DYK:

17
18

Oh, okay.
And that turns on the distinction

between mandatory and permissive subjects of bargaining.
QUESTION:

But insofar as they're alleg -- their

claiming there was an active misrepresentation or a fraud,

you would agree that could be remedied by the board.

QUESTION:

1
2

Does the board have jurisprudence

cases on misrepresentation and fraud?

3

MR. DYK:

Yes.

I mean, this Court's decision in

4

Truett Manufacturing discusses the obligation to engage in

5

honest bargaining, and the board has implemented that in a

6

large number of cases.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Dyk, you may have answered this.

8

I may have missed it.

But you said there is some subjects

9

in which jurisdiction may be concurrent and some not.

10

Where do you draw the line?

11

MR. DYK:

How do we draw the line?

Well, the line, Justice Souter, that

12

I'm suggesting that you draw is between matters that are

13

asserted as defense, either contract defenses before the

14

board or unfair labor practice defenses in court, as

15

opposed to allowing affirmative jurisdiction.

16

bring contract issues in the first instance before the

17

board or bring unfair labor practice charges before the

18

courts.

That is, to

QUESTION:

But that does --

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Dyk, what about the Mack case?

21

Do you agree that that was properly a case for the court

we've got no contract.

24

Court, tell us we have a contract.

25

That is, an employer that said, the union says

correct, a dispute about a violation in the Mack case, the

2

original -- the Third Circuit case that preceded this one

3

and yes, that probably was within -- that was probably

4

correctly decided.

5

QUESTION:

What about a classic contract dispute

6

as to whether there was a meeting of the minds?

7

there's no violation of the Labor Relations Act.

8

not an unfair labor practice if the minds have not met.

the law of labor contacts made by State law rather than

MR. DYK:

10

Well, our position, Justice Scalia, is

11

that there isn't any room for State law here, that even if

12

you went into State court, that you would have to apply

13

Federal law, but that the State court no more than the

QUESTION:

And the reason for no anticipatory-

say, there would be no conflict with board jurisdiction,

QUESTION:

But if you can't have an action for a

in light of the statute, and you can't have an action for

7

MR. DYK:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we agree that

8

you can have an action to construe the contract for

9

violation of the contract that requires a construction of

10

the contract.

11

What we're suggesting is that somehow, if this

anything relating to the contract, a position which you

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

20

MR. YOKICH:

Our view of possible mootness is

21

that there is a fair question of mootness in this case

22

because the contract has expired, but that this is a

23

situation that is a labor case, the labor cases tend to

resolve themselves quickly and that therefore it's a

situation that's capable of repetition, evading review.

MR. YOKICH:

I think there is a potential impact

of that declaration.

think about the capable of repetition evading review are

11

I think Mr. Dyk's argument about the

all stronger arguments.
Since Lincoln Mills v. -- since Textile Workers

12

v. Lincoln Mills this Court has held that section 301

13

gives the responsibility to the Federal courts to fashion

14

a body of law for the enforcement of collective bargaining

15

agreements.

16

In the Lincoln Mills case, the Court rejected a

17

literal reading of the statute.

18

that the statute was jurisdictional and instead found that

19

the statute created the power to develop a whole body of

20

cases with respect to the enforcement of contracts.

21

It rejected a reading

In addition in Lincoln Mills, the Court held

22

that the statute gave the Federal courts a wide choice of

23

remedies, remedies such as specific performance in that

24

specific case and, in addition to that, remedies such as

25

declaratory judgments.

In Lincoln Mills, for example, specific

2

performance was a remedy that you can't find in the

3

language of section 301 and is one that's really been

4

traditionally disfavored in terms of agreements to

5

arbitrate and disfavored in terms of employment law.

Are you saying that Lincoln Mills

broadened the jurisdictional grant beyond the language

that Congress had chosen?

MR. YOKICH:

I'm not saying -That's what we're talking about here.

Lincoln Mills' reading of the jurisdictional grant was a

13

fair one based upon that language.

14

QUESTION:

Well, are you -- what -- beyond suits

for violation of contracts, which is the statutory

16

language, do you think Lincoln Mills said other things are

17

included in that jurisdictional grant, too?

18

have read it that way.

19

MR. YOKICH:

I wouldn't

Well, I think Lincoln Mills said

20

that the phrase, for violation of contracts, is a broad

21

enough phrase so that the courts have the responsibility

22

to develop a complete body of law with respect to the

23

enforcement of collective bargaining agreements.

says is that when we have issues that deal with what the

that it was a mandatory subject and that the parties did

2

not bargain in good faith over that mandatory subject, and

3

that the subcontracted clause that would let the board --

4

that would let the employer proceed on that subject was

procured by fraud, and so the fraud really comes in, in

the board's theory at least, in the tail end of the case

May I just interrupt you with a

it is not a mandatory subject of bargaining, but there was

QUESTION:

Are there any board cases saying they

statement that the NLRB could, as a remedy for an unfair

2

labor practice, invalidate the contract.

3

MR. YOKICH:

Well, the cases the petitioner's

4

brief relies on, first of all they all deal with mandatory

5

subjects where the employer had an obligation to bargain

6

about them.

7

Second, if you look at the most recent case, the

8

Waymouth case, it speaks of a particular commitment that

9

was made in a contract that has -- that was held not to be

10
11

binding upon the union.
It was a case where the union said, if you move

12

to another site this contract's not going to cover us

13

representing the people at the other site.

14

misled the union about where it was moving to, and the

15

board said, well, you can't enforce that specific term of

16

the contract, and again that's very much consistent with

the board's theory in this case, which goes to a specific

QUESTION:

That would be strange, really, if you

have a limited jurisdictional grant and then construed to

authorize development of substantive law in cases within

doctrines enlarged the jurisdictional grant.

12

MR. YOKICH:

I'm not trying to argue that,

Mr. Chief Justice.

14

that the courts in Lincoln Mills read the language, did

not apply it literally to just give them jurisdiction,

this is put in as a defense to the enforcement of a
specific term of the contract.

I'm not aware of any

arbitration cases that throw out a whole contract because
of a claim of voidance of this kind.
QUESTION:

Well, my question was whether or not

there are cases going to the scope of the arbitrator's
authority.

One party says the contract says suits for

violation of this agreement are arbitrated, and the issue
is whether or not there's fraud, and the party who's
trying to defend says, oh, well, the arbitrator can't
consider this because this goes to the whole contract and
this is not a violation of the contract.
MR. YOKICH:
into two parts.

There are -- let me divide that

There are Federal court cases that deal

with enforcements of agreements to arbitrate that deal
with the issue of, can that agreement be enforced due to
the fraud, and quite honestly there's a mish-mash of the
cases.

They go different ways.
There are cases, for example, in the Fifth

Circuit that say that if an issue of fraud is raised, then
that's something the court has to determine before it can
order the case to arbitration and that, of course, is, one
thing that would happen were this case to go back down is
that the district court would have to consider the

What do you say about what I take it

is the declaratory judgment theory?
Suppose Mr. Dyk were to say, yes, of course, you

6

7

can bring that kind of claim as a declaratory judgment to

get the contract declared void because that's a possible

9

defense that you'd have if the employer were to sue you,

10

but that isn't the theory that was argued below and

11

anyway, if it were, you'd lose because you have to have

12

some kind of threat that the employer really would sue

you, and here there was none.

MR. YOKICH:

Well, I think that your reaction to

an impact on the employer if there's a strike, where you

have an impact on the union, and where you could have

I say, why would it have been "under

for Federal courts?

18

MR. YOKICH:

Well, what the Court held in AVCO

19

was that a State court breach of contract claim was

20

something that arose under section 301 and was therefore

21

removable, and as a consequence, if you go into State

22

court on a breach of contract claim it's going to be

23

determined by the same standards that this Court uses

24

under section 301.

section 301, it's not removable, I would suppose.
MR. YOKICH:

Well, and I think that reading Dowd

Box and AVCO together means that if it relates to a

collective bargaining agreement, that you use the Federal

law under section 301.

Of course, you're going to have to

discuss sooner or later whether one reason you couldn't go

into State court would be because of Garmon preemption,

20

which at least they say applies here, too.

21

MR. YOKICH:

Well, our position on that is that

22

their analysis of section 301 doesn't really do a very

23

good job of explaining how that would work, and that's

24

because presumably if you went into State court you'd be

25

governed by State rules of procedure, and you could have a

MR. YOKICH:

that's because we've had declaratory judgments in the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY B. DYK

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

13

<

Thank you, Mr. Yokich.

MR. DYK:

Just briefly, Mr. Chief Justice, if

14

you look at the complaint that was filed in this case,

15

which is pages 16 to 19 of the joint appendix, and

16

particularly to paragraphs 5 through 10, which are the

17

operative paragraphs, you can see quite clearly that the

18

theory of this complaint is a failure to supply

19

information in response to the union's request.

20

This is at the heart of the board's expertise

21

and the board's jurisdiction, determining when there is an

22

obligation on the part of the employer to supply

23

information to the union.

24

The union has admitted in its brief that board

25

law must apply to this proceeding, so we suggest that in

1

terms of the substantive rules, there's an exact parallel

2

here between the complaint theory and the board theory,

3

and Justice Stevens, I don't know of a lot of cases where

4

the board has addressed misrepresentations in the context

5

of permissive bargaining, but there's no reason as a

6

matter of theory that that shouldn't be the case.

7

/

And if one looks at the brief filed by the

8

United States here, the United States does not suggest

9

that there's any gap in the jurisdiction of the board with

10

respect to this particular case.

11

that the board can invalidate contracts, make employees

12

whole -- there's an absolute identity of the theories that

13

can be brought before the board and the relief that can be

14

gotten from the board, and the board was set up by

15

Congress to determine what relief should be granted under

16

these circumstances.

17

They make very clear

Sometimes it will be invalidation of the whole

18

contract or, as here, a part of the contract, and it's

19

that kind of discretion, that kind of expertise which the

20

board has and the courts don't have and is a primary

21

reason why this Court should not permit the Federal courts

22

to, in essence, adjudicate unfair labor practices that

23

otherwise would come before the board.

Can the board award damages, which is

one of the things they sought here?
