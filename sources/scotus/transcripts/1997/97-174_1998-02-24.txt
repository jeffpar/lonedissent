ORAL ARGUMENT OF EARL EDWIN MAUS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. MAUS:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
It's Cass County's position in this case that

12

the alienable land patented in fee by the Federal

13

Government and subsequently reacquired in fee by the

14

Indian tribe is subject to State and local taxation absent

15

treaty or statutory exceptions to the contrary.

16

In 1889, Congress passed the Nelson Act, which

17

provided for the complete cession and relinquishments of

18

lands to the Federal Government.

19

in turn, pursuant to section 3 of the Nelson Act and in

20

conformity with section 5 of the General Allotment Act,

21

issued individual allotments to Indians in conformity with

22

the section 5.

The Federal Government

23

Pursuant to sections 4 and 5 of the Nelson Act,

24

they sold pinelands, which were basically timberlands, on

25

the open market to individuals.

1

Pursuant to section 6, they issued homestead

2

patents, or gave patents in fee under the Homestead Act to

3

various individuals, again on the open market.

4

In 1993, Cass County began taxing all of the

5

above lands and that was following the 1992 Yakima

6

decision which was set forth by this case -- 1992, Yakima

7

County v. Yakima Indian Nation.

8

At that time, there were 21 parcels, 13 of those

9

parcels involved a lot of land, and that issue has already

10

been resolved in the Eighth Circuit, and it was a petition

11

for further review of that, and that was denied on cross-

12

petition for that.

13

So at issue here today are the pinelands

14

parcels, seven of those, and one homestead parcel.

15

These various parcels, I'd point out to the

16

court, are now -- the ones that are left, they're all in

17

trust at the present time, have been placed in trust and I

18

believe it's a matter of public record since about 1995.

19

Why we're here today, there's still the issue of

20

back taxes that were sued for.

21

both sides want to know how to deal with lands --

22

23
24
25

QUESTION:

In addition, obviously,

Are these parcels within the

boundaries of the tribal reservation here?
MR. MAUS:

For purposes of this lawsuit we have

stipulated that the lands are within the reservation

boundaries.

Whether or not they're within accepted

2

reservation boundaries based on some of the Court's recent

3

cases or not - -

4

QUESTION:

But --

5

MR. MAUS:

- - is a matter for another day.

6

QUESTION:

Right.

They're within the

7

reservation boundaries and held in trust for the benefit

8

of the tribe, by virtue of the reacquisition by the tribe?

9

MR. MAUS:

That's correct.

They've subsequently

10

been put in the trust, and in -- obviously the period that

11

we were taxing them was while they were being held in fee,

12

up and until they were put in the trust, and once they're

13

put into the trust there's no dispute that we cannot tax

14

them.

15

QUESTION:

And if they had never been sold off

16

as pinelands and homesteads, you concede that no county

17

tax would have been possible?

18

MR. MAUS:

That's correct.

If they hadn't been

19

placed on the open market, and it's our contention that

20

the Nelson Act did that and, indeed, they have been taxed

21

since their inception or their sale on the open market

22

back in the early 1900's --

23

QUESTION:

And there were additional parcels

24

that were reacquired pursuant to the lands covered by the

25

Dawes Act as amended by the Burke Act, but they're not at

MR. MAUS:

They're no longer at issue, that's

QUESTION:

And as to those parcels the tax is

correct.

4
5

being levied and the Burke Act expressly says that

6

taxation is possible, I take it?

7

MR. MAUS:

Well, the Burke Act says that but we

8

believe that the Court went a step farther than that in

9

the Yakima case in finding that the Burke Act made it more

10

clear, but that section 5 of the General Allotment Act

11

made it clear and made those lands taxable as they were

12

alienable following the logic, basically, of Goudy v.

13

Meath, which was decided in 1906, and decided also by this

14

Court.

15

QUESTION:

May I be sure I understood something

16

you said?

17

you tell me that you seek to tax it while it was owned by

18

the tribe, but you say you cannot tax it after the tribe

19

had it put back in trust?

When the land was reacquired by the tribe, did

20

MR. MAUS:

That's correct.

21

QUESTION:

And who's the trustee?

22

States the trustee?

23

MR. MAUS:

Yes, they are.

Is the United

process, pursuant to the Reorganization Act, which was

25

passed in 1934, there's a trust process where the band can

acquire lands, apply to put them into trust, and the

2

Department of Interior makes a decision based on whether

3

or not they're to be put in trust, and one of the criteria

4

for that decision is basically the effect on local units

5

of government.
QUESTION:

6

I don't quite understand why it

7

should make a difference whether the land is owned

8

outright by the tribe or held for the tribe in trust by

9

the United States.

10

make a difference.
MR. MAUS:

11

I don't understand why that should

You know, basically that's -- the

12

difference being this, is that's what Congress decided to

13

do, and they did a balancing test, obviously, when they

14

did the -- passed the Indian Reorganization Act, and

15

wanted to look at land as - -

16

QUESTION:

17

required by the 1934 statute.

18

MR. MAUS:

The answer in other words is, that's

That's correct, and there is specific

19

language that says, once it's put into trust, that it's

20

not taxable.

21

QUESTION:

I see.

QUESTION:

Is it also not alienable if it's in

That's correct.

That's correct.

1

the Department of Interior would have to approve any sale.

2

QUESTION:

And so --

3

QUESTION:

And that's the second 465 procedure

4

that you said, if they want to get tax-exempt -- it

5

doesn't happen automatically.

6

O'Connor asked you when the tribe reacquires it, does it

7

then gain exemption, and I think your answer is no, not

8

unit there is this 465 procedure to put it back in trust,

9

at which point it's neither alienable nor taxable.

I think when Justice

10

MR. MAUS:

That's correct.

11

QUESTION:

So how many years are we talking

12

about that it was in this state where it was reacquired by

13

the tribe but not yet put in trust?

14

MR. MAUS:

Okay.

All of the parcels in issue,

15

all 21 of them, have been purchased -- were purchased

16

since 1980.

17

That was the earliest of those.

14 out of those original 21 had been purchased

18

in 1993.

19

some confusion in the -- within the State, you know, can

20

this land be taxed or not, you know, prior to being put

21

into trust, and after the Yakima decision came out, at

22

least at the county level we received one of the State

23

memos basically saying that it appears that this land is

24

taxable and we put it on the tax roll.

25

We began taxing them in 1993.

QUESTION:

I guess there was

So we're talking about 2 years.

1

MR. MAUS:

We're talking about -- well,

2

basically if we -- if it went on the tax rolls in 1993 it

3

would have been taxes payable in 1994, and the lawsuit was

4

commenced in '95, and towards the latter part of '95 all

5

of these parcels, or at least the remaining parcels were

6

put into trust, so we're talking about a year-and-a-half,

7

basically, I guess of actual, payable taxes for most of

8

the parcels, maybe more or less for some of them.

9

QUESTION:

Does the provision of the law which

10

enables these parcels to be put in trust, does that say

11

that when they go into trust they are no longer taxable?

12

13
14

MR. MAUS:

Yes.

Section 465 specifically says

that once lands are in trust they are not taxable.
QUESTION:

That probably wouldn't be necessary

15

if they're not taxable anyway so long as the tribe

16

acquires them.

17

MR. MAUS:

That's correct.

It's our belief that

18

the legislature could have, had they wanted to with the

19

Indian Reorganization Act clearly made all lands that were

20

acquired by the tribe not taxable, or reacquired, but they

21

didn't do that.

22

forth that process to give us some input.

23

They stopped short of that, in effect set

QUESTION:

Now --

But your point is that there's a

24

distinction because if it's not put into trust the tribe

25

can sell it and do whatever it wants to with it, but if

1

they put it in a trust they have to get the consent of the

2

United States to do something with it.

3

MR. MAUS:

That's correct.

4

QUESTION:

Yes.

5

MR. MAUS:

And I -- you know, I point out to the

6

Court that I know that the tribe in this particular case

7

and United States is taking an opposite position saying,

8

well, we just can't sell the land, and I would submit to

9

this Court that that -- I don't believe that that's the

10
11
12

case, and that's not our position.
QUESTION:

You're talking about the Indian

Nonintercourse Act - -

13

MR. MAUS:

Correct.

QUESTION:

15

MR. MAUS:

It --

16

QUESTION:

Well, that -- what is your answer to

17

the Indian Nonintercourse Act?

18

does say that, doesn't it?

19

MR. MAUS:

I mean if you read it, it

But it's real simple.

It - - one of

20

the parts that it says early on - - you know, it's passed

21

in 1834, okay, and --

24

QUESTION:

I thought it was earlier than that.

Is that when it started?
MR. MAUS:

I thought it was --

Yes.

It was actually before then,

but the latest version, I guess -10

QUESTION:

Oh --

2

MR. MAUS:

-- that Congress had addressed was

3

1834, and it provided that lands couldn't be sold without

4

the permission of Congress.

5

to sell lands.

6

and start ceding them to individuals.

In other words, Congress was

In other words, States couldn't take lands

Well, the simple answer to that, the real short

7
8

one is, along comes the Nelson Act.

9

authority.

There's Congress'

In fact, they take the land, they cede it and

10

relinquish any title of it and give it to the Federal

11

Government, who then puts it on the open market, so is

12

there authority to get around the Nonintercourse Act?

13

Absolutely.

14

In addition to that --

15

QUESTION:

Well, there was at the time of the --

16

there was at the time of the allotment and the other

17

distributions, but the question is, doesn't the term --

18

don't the terms of the act cover it now that it is back in

19

Indian or tribal ownership?

20

MR. MAUS:

Two basic answers to that, I guess.

21

There's one -- you know, if you look at the logic of

22

reacquired lands, if you're looking at that pure logic,

23

you have the Indian Reorganization Act, which deals with

24

the reacquisition of lands and a determination of whether

25

or not they should be taxable or not, whether or not they

2

should be put into trust or not, and second of all -QUESTION:

The point that there would have been

3

no point in making that, the taxability a consideration

4

when it went into trust if - - unless it were taxable

5

before it goes into trust.

6

MR. MAUS:

Correct.

7

QUESTION:

Right, okay.

8

MR. MAUS:

And second of all, with respect to

9

that, you know, the Court couldn't have decided the Yakima

10

case the way it did had that been the case, because in

11

Yakima I believe that there were some parcels of land that

12

were due to go tax-forfeited and that was at issue also,

13

because there was some government lands and some

14

individual.

15
16

QUESTION:

That may imply that alienability

simply is not the sole criterion.

17

MR. MAUS:

Correct.

18

QUESTION:

Why -- what -- is this -- it seems to

19

me if we're talking about these particular parcels,

20

they're the same as any other parcels that have been out

21

there, occupied and owned by people who are not Indians in

22

fee simple.

23

could have ended up in the hands of non-Indians for many

24

such -- many reasons.

25

There could be many such parcels, and it

parcel of land that previously didn't belong to the tribe,

2

on the reservation, and isn't the issue whether, once the

3

tribe acquires that, whether it ever -- whatever it is,

4

it's in the reservation.

5

taxable or not?

They bought it.

Now, is it

And if the principle is, well, it's not taxable

6

7

only because it's in the tribe's hands, however it got

8

there, unless Congress clearly says so, where did Congress

9

clearly say so?
MR. MAUS:

10

We believe that Congress clearly said

11

that the land was taxable first, I guess, looking at the

12

Nelson Act itself.

13

everyone.

14

QUESTION:

I mean, it gave absolute fee title to

Yes, but that has nothing to do with

15

the issue.

16

when the tribe owns the land and gets rid of it.

The issue -- that's an issue of what happens

17

MR. MAUS:

Okay.

18

QUESTION:

Now, that's not our issue.

Our issue

19

is, there's some land out there that doesn't belong to the

20

tribe.

We don't care how or why it doesn't belong to the

21

tribe.

It doesn't.

22

Now, the tribe acquires it.

not taxable once it's in the hands of the tribe, however

2

it got there, unless Congress clearly says so - -

3

MR. MAUS:

Mm-hmm.

4

QUESTION:

-- where did Congress clearly say so?

5

MR. MAUS:

We believe that Congress clearly said

6

so by making it alienable, and again I don't want to pound

7

on the Nelson Act, but that's what -- what made alienable,

8

and then looking at the logic of Goudy v. Meath and the

9

Yakima case, which basically are allowing for the

10

taxability of the land because it's alienable, the tax is

11

on the land itself, and I think that Congress has

12

specifically acted in the area of lands and addressed

13

that, you know, both in the Nelson Act and then later, of

14

course, in the Indian Reorganization Act.

15

And if you look at the intent of Congress -- and

16

clearly we have to put up unmistakably clear intent, and

17

that's a burden we accept, and we do think that's the

18

correct burden of proof here.

19

We think that is all met when you add up, you

20

know, the way it's put into fee, okay, the logic of the

21

alienability of the Yakima and Goudy decisions -- Congress

22

clearly made it taxable -- and if you look at, you know,

23

the allotted lands, you know, they made them taxable after

24

25 years as opposed to immediately.

25

part of the General Allotment Act.

You know, that was

1

So clearly, you know, you could look at that and

2

say, well, in the case we have here, would it make sense

3

to tax people that reacquired lands that were originally

4

allotted to them and not tax lands that were put open in

5

the general market?

6

make much sense.

7

QUESTION:

I mean, that kind of logic doesn't

And of course, then they have the

8

trust thing you were talking about.

9

the trust thing if they're not taxable in - - I mean, you

10
11

So, why do they need

know, if it isn't nontaxable once they reacquire it.
MR. MAUS:

That's correct, and obviously it --

12

well, there's been a history of abuse of getting it into

13

trust, and so one could look at it and say, well, you

14

could always apply for trust.

15

do to stop that?

16

the future.

17

Well, what are you going to

Well, we don't know what will happen in

More recently the Department of Interior has

18

changed some rules which now allow for 30 days after they

19

decide to put land into trust for counties or local units

20

the Government to appeal under the Administrative

21

Procedures Act if we feel that the decision was not

22

appropriate, so we do have that ability now.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Maus -- I'm not sure we have to

24

reach it, but maybe we do.

I'm really troubled by the

Indian Nonintercourse Act.

this is land that was never tribal land?

It was never opened to homesteading or

3

anything.

It was just never Indian land.
And the tribe, as a tribe, buys this parcel of

4
5

It was never

6

MR. MAUS:

Okay.

Sure.

7

QUESTION:

It was never tribal land.

Why isn't

8

that land covered by the Indian Nonintercourse Act, so

9

that once the tribe has it, the tribe cannot again resell

10

it without a treaty or authority from Congress?

about land that was acquired for the first time outside

13

the reservation?

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

15

MR. MAUS:

Okay.

Yes.
I think the Reorganization Act

16

deals with land acquisitions by the tribe in general,

17

either reacquired or acquired, and I think that those same

18

provisions would apply, and it could certainly be argued

19

that - QUESTION:

What provisions, the provisions

22

MR. MAUS:

The trust provisions under 465.

23

QUESTION:

And which imply, according to you,

20
21

that - -

24

that if they are not put into trust they are taxable,

MR. MAUS:

Correct.

Now

2

QUESTION:

And then you would reason, and since

3

they are taxable, you'd sort of go backwards from your

4

reasoning for the purposes of this case, you're saying.

5

MR. MAUS:

Sure.

6

QUESTION:

Since they're taxable, they must be

7

alienable, just as for this case --

8

MR. MAUS:

Sure.

QUESTION:

-- you'd say if they're alienable

10

they must be taxable.

That's how you get there?

11

MR. MAUS:

Well, I --

12

QUESTION:

That's ingenious.

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. MAUS:

Well, I don't know about that, but

15

the alienability results in taxability absent treaty or

16

statutory exceptions.

17

Now, there may be some treaties that make land

18

that might be alienable.

19

not necessarily taxable because it specifically says it's

20

not taxable.

21

Maybe you can sell it, but it's

And also, in addition to that, you know, the

22

tribe also has the ability to apply for State exemptions

23

without even going through the trust process, maybe to

24

keep their land alienable, and maybe it's exempt for

some -- if it's for some governmental type purpose that's

viewed by the States as being exempt.
For example, maybe a highway maintenance garage,

3

or similar, like, you know, local units of government are

4

exempt from taxation, just like cities are exempt from

5

county taxation unless they have investment type

6

properties.

Those would probably be found taxable.

7

So there is a difference there.

8

I would submit to the Court that deciding this
decision to say alienability results in taxability absent

10

treaty or statutory exceptions to the contrary would

11

establish a bright line rule that could be applied.

12

doesn't go too far, in that if there are individual

13

treaties out there, or individual statutes with some of

14

the various tribes or States that prohibit this, that they

15

couldn't be taxed, and I think that would be fair for all.

16

It

I think that this would certainly allow the - -

17

both units of government input in the decision-making

18

process which it appears clear that Congress has given

1

through the trust process, to allow the local units of

20

government at least to have their say.

21

Second, you know that as a -- or another point,

22

as I also indicated, they have the ability to apply for

State exemptions.

QUESTION:

But you told us that's in fact what

8

happened.

It's only a year-and-a-half we're talking about

9

because the Government did put this land back in trust,

10

and -- which made it exempt, so the argument that the

11

counties are losing all this revenue, it wouldn't have had

12

the opportunity to get any if the Government had moved

13

fast enough on the 465, right?

14

MR. MAUS:

Well, I would submit to the Court

15

that if we're looking at the future, you know, the trust

16

process has changed, and will the tribes be able to get

17

land into trust in the future the way they have in the

18

past?

19

we've opposed them all and never been successful, but now

20

there's a new appeal process and we haven't --we haven't

21

tried that yet, and that may result in the slowing down of

22

lands put into trust, or at least give us some input, or

23

more input into that process.

Basically, throughout the history of the county

you've got a picture of that, is basically one of tourism.

Mr. Schoessler, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES J. SCHOESSLER

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

5
6

7

MR. SCHOESSLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As a preliminary matter I'd like to address a

8

question that was raised about the Indian Reorganization

9

Act and 25 U.S.C. section 465, which is the section that

10

allows the United States Government to take land into

11

trust for Indian tribes.

12

I think there was an implication made to the

13

Court that that section somehow granted taxing

14

jurisdiction to States and counties over land by negative

15

implication.

16

QUESTION:

Well, what it says, the negative --

17

it does expressly say that if the Secretary does acquire

18

the land in trust for the Indians, the land shall

19

therefore be tax-exempt, which one assumes that before it

20

was acquired it was not tax-exempt.

21

as I understand it.

22

MR. SCHOESSLER:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. SCHOESSLER:

25

That's the argument,

Yes.

Yes.
It's basically a negative

implication, to which I think two responses are required.

(800) FOR DEPO

1

The first one probably is that that kind of a

2

negative implication would be completely antithetical to

3

the philosophy that was behind the adoption of the Indian

4

Reorganization Act and the promotion of tribal

5

independence and self-sufficiency that forms the basis of

6

the act and the rebuilding of the reservation land base

7

that, at least partially, that act was all about.

8

9

The second thing I would point out is that, in
fact, this Court has addressed the negative implication

10

question in the past in a decision that was issued in

11

1973, Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones.

12

The Court had an opportunity to look at the

13

legislative history and the wording of the trust

14

provisions of the Indian Reorganization Act and the Court

15

there specifically said that there was nothing in that act

16

or its history which indicated an intent on the part of

17

Congress to remove the traditional tax exemptions that

18

tribes had within reservations.

19

QUESTION:

Well, but that leaves open the

20

question, doesn't it, because the question here is whether

21

this particular tax exemption in fact would -- is of the

22

traditional variety, or whether, because of the history

23

traced in Yakima, it's in a different position.

24

MR. SCHOESSLER:

25

Yes, Your Honor --

So I think what the Court said really

2

leaves the question right where we find it.
MR. SCHOESSLER:

The point that I was simply

3

making is that there is no authority within the Indian

4

Reorganization Act and section 465 to find a grant of

5

jurisdiction, even by negative implication to counties or

6

States to tax tribal lands.

7

QUESTION:

That may be.

I think -- I thought

8

the point was simply that it confirms a conclusion that we

9

might reach on other ground.

10

MR. SCHOESSLER:

It does bring up, I think, what

11

the basic point of this case is anyway, and the basic rule

12

of law that should govern this case.

13

that even the county agrees with.

14

was cited as authoritative by the county, and it's well-

15

known to this Court.

16

rule, what's called the per se rule, against taxation of

17

Indians and tribes in Indian country.

18

QUESTION:

It's a rule of law

It's not disputed.

It

It's the unmistakably clear intent

The trouble is we say that on the one

19

hand and we also have language very similar to that.

20

is, that it's almost irrefutable implication that where

21

there is alienability there is taxability.

22

said something along those lines, and these two absolutes

23

seem to be clashing head on in the present case.

that now, Your Honor.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. SCHOESSLER:

12

By all means, yes.

Yes.

I would like to talk about

Goudy v. Meath --

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

14

MR. SCHOESSLER:

-- because, after all, it is

15

probably the foundation of the county's argument here.

16

It's the case which the county asserts set forth an

17

alienability equals taxability rule, and I'd like to make

18

a few observations about that case.

19

Number 1, the unmistakably clear intent rule was

20

even at that time a fairly longstanding principle in the

21

law going back to the Kansas Indians and probably Russo v.

22

Georgia for that matter, so the Goudy court was well aware

23

of that principle.

24
25

The Goudy opinion, it seems to us just on the
face of it, is a somewhat odd decision on which to base a

fairly major shift from that per se rule against taxation.

2

The opinion itself was only two pages long.

one-page statement of facts and a less-than-one-page

4

opinion by Justice Brewer.

5

There was a

The opinion does not examine in detail prior

6

Indian law precedent relating to jurisdictional matters.

7

The opinion does not seem to indicate that new Indian law

8

ground is being plowed, or is intended to be plowed in

9

that short opinion, and there's no indication, it seems to

10

us, that the Court is clearly establishing a new generic

11

rule of law that says alienability equals taxability.

QUESTION:

Was the Indian Nonintercourse Act in

effect, or its predecessor, at the time of Goudy?

14

MR. SCHOESSLER:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

Yes, it was, Your Honor.

MR. SCHOESSLER:

I think the Court in Goudy did

18

not address or consider the Indian Nonintercourse Act and

19

I think it was for this reason, and it's probably I think

20

the most critical factor in Goudy and perhaps one of the

21

more misunderstood factors in Goudy, and that is the fact

22

that the Goudy court treated the plaintiff in that case,

23

James Goudy, not as an Indian but as a non-Indian citizen.

24

It was stipulated to in that case that Goudy was

25

to be treated as a non-Indian citizen.

That was referred

2

the decision in that case.

because it reversed presumptions.

It was terribly important

As a non-Indian citizen Goudy was presumed

It ruled that James Goudy could not

demonstrate an unmistakably clear exemption from the

It's not going to be with us if the

MR. SCHOESSLER:

7

If the rule turns out to be

8

alienability equals taxability, what has been said

9

essentially is that the only land or property on

trust property, property actually owned by the United

argue that, but our most serious concern is the

6

The other point that I would make about that is

by adopting such a rule you have essentially de facto

about saying if the land went to a non-Indian then it

10

If my recollection is correct

It's an a fortiori kind of argument, and at some

QUESTION:

Well, he -- but I think we accept,

If you take that as your

it a pretty strong argument that lands that went out by

conveyances have got to be in the same position, or you're

attributing a certain sort of bizarreness to Congress.

MS. McDOWELL:

This Court's rule is that there

QUESTION:

1

But once the Court has determined

2

that it is clear with respect to land that was allotted to

3

individual Indians, once the Court has made that

4

determination that that is clear, then why isn't it, as

5

Justice Souter says, equally clear that no rational

6

Congress could have envisioned a different treatment for

the land that went out not under allotments to individual

Indians?

9

What rational Congress would say, yeah, we meant

10

that if it was allotted to Indians, it's reacquired by the

11

tribe tax-free, but if it went out under the Homestead

12

Act, then the tribe has its exemption?

13

MS. McDOWELL:

Congress obviously would have

14

understood at the time that there were many different tax

15

statuses that might have occurred with respect to the

homestead lands and the pinelands, depending on whether

two paradigm examples of land uses that Congress would

have assumed would be taxable in the normal course and

4

that, if anything, makes the a fortiori argument all the

stronger.

6

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, Congress doubtless would

have assumed that they would be taxable in the hands of an

ordinary non-Indian individual or business taxpayer, but

9

we cannot conclude what Congress would have intended had

10

the lands been reacquired by a tribe within the boundaries

11

of an existing reservation.

Congress was legislating in 189 - - 89 at the

time of the Nelson Act and subsequently, in light of this

14

Court's decision, for example, in the New York Indians,

MS. McDOWELL:

That's correct, but there are

always been recognized to be exempt from tax.

QUESTION:

But they're protected by - - those

lands aren't -- they're protected by the rule, aren't

8

they, of alienability equals taxability?

9

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, traditionally those lands

10

have been understood to be protected by the fact of Indian

11

tax immunity, the absence of a clear statement, and the

12

fact that those lands were within an existing reservation,

13

the New York Indians being an example of that case.

14

Certainly it's hard to attribute to Congress an

unexpressed intent to overrule the New York Indians and

say that it took section 6 and the Burke Act proviso to

make that implication clear.

QUESTION:

To make it more clear.

It said,

7

reaffirmed, made it more clear, reaffirmed, but reaffirmed

8

sounds to me like it was confirming what was already --

9

MS. McDOWELL:

I think it's important to look at

10

section 3 of the Court's opinion in Yakima, where the

11

Court actually starts applying the clear statement rule to

12

the actual two taxes at issue in that case and there, when

13

the Court decides that the ad valorem tax in Yakima is

14

permissible, it is because it constitutes, quote, taxation

15

of property within the meaning of section 6 of the General

Allotment Act and the Burke Act proviso.

But if everything rides on the Burke

MS. McDOWELL:

May I answer, Your Honor?

Yes, you may.
The Court looked back at

MR. MAUS:

A couple of things, I guess, one just

on the Burke Act, just to comment on that.
The Burke Act needed to say that the land given

and early fee patented was taxable, because if it hadn't

13

said that, I submit to the Court, there was still that

14

provision out there that had the 25-year trust period, and

15

that would have meant that the land would have become

alienable, not taxable to the -- at the end of that 25

years, so the Court had to - - I mean, the proviso needed

to say that for the early fee patenting.
