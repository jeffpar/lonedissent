ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. TRIBE:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
One judge in Michigan, without an adversary

12

13

hearing, enters a consent decree as part of a stipulated

14

monetary settlement between G.M. and an employee, Ron

15

Elwell.

16

practices that it considers damaging but is unable to

17

suppress in the usual manner -- that is, by persuading a

18

judge that the testimony is inadmissible because of

19

attorney-client privilege, trade secrets, and the like.

The employee can give testimony about G.M.'s

20

The decree permanently enjoins the employee from

21

being deposed or testifying without the consent of General

22

Motors as a witness of any kind in State or Federal

23

litigation brought against G.M. anywhere by anyone,

24

whether a private plaintiff seeking damages or a public

25

official enforcing health and safety regulations or

criminal statutes.
QUESTION:

2

Mr. Tribe, you refer to the Michigan

3

proceeding as a consent decree.

4

precisely do you mean by that?

5

MR. TRIBE:

What are you -- what

What I mean, Mr. Chief Justice,

is

6

that there was no adversary hearing and though consent

8

it was a stipulated settlement entered on the record by

9

the judge after -QUESTION:

10
11

Well, that's true of all settlements,

isn't it, that there's no adversary hearing?
MR. TRIBE:

12

Sure.

This is not -- we're not

3

suggesting that there was anything unique or unusual about

4

it.

5

unusual,

6

employee or to call him as a witness comes from a litigant

7

who was not a party to and had no notice of the little

8

proceeding that led to the quite usual entry of the

9

decree.

What's unusual, or at least what some people think is
is that the request for a subpoena to depose the

if anything,

worse that they didn't have notice.

litigated.

MR. TRIBE:

That's certainly true, Justice

Ginsburg --

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. TRIBE:

So --- and it's in addition true that if

21

there had been litigation,

it's somewhat ironic that a

22

determination by Judge Hathaway in Michigan that,

23

example, some document was privileged in a proceeding

24

between General Motors and Elwell would obviously not be

25

binding against the Bakers here, and yet the intriguing

thing is that this decree, the injunction, has this

2

enormous effect on them.

3

that they weren't there?

4

The question is, does it matter

The district court thought it mattered a great

5

deal, invoked what it called the rights of third

6

parties -- at page 28a -- and essentially took the

7

position that the full --

10

QUESTION:

This is the district court in

Missouri now?
MR. TRIBE:

No, I'm sorry, the district -- yes,

11

the district court below, in Missouri, Mr. Chief

12

Justice -- took the position that the full faith and

13

credit statute should not be read to mean that a decree of

14

this kind, and I quote him, forever defines the rights of

15

innocent third parties who have a keen interest in the

16

information that Elwell holds.

17

Now, the Eighth Circuit disagreed, took the

18

position that the whole point of the decree was to dispose

19

of what it called these discovery rights of litigants, and

20

to do so in all of the other lawsuits that the Michigan

21

judge assumed would follow.

22

Of course, if the Eighth Circuit is right, the

23

consequences are pretty sweeping.

The old maxim that the

24

public has a right to every man's evidence will need a

25

footnote saying, unless he has sold his silence -6

QUESTION:

MR. TRIBE:

Why is that?

Isn't the issue just

whether the Baker -- what's the -- the plaintiff --

5

MR. TRIBE:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. TRIBE:

8

QUESTION:

9

Why is that?

The plaintiffs here are the Bakers.
The Bakers -The children.
-- would have to go to Michigan and

say, we're not bound by the Michigan decree.

Of course

10

they're not bound by it.

11

they'd say, look, we've never litigated this, and

12

therefore will you please modify the decree because, after

13

all, we don't want to ask him about any privileged

14

information.

15

confidential information.

16

have a right to.

17

We were never parties.

18

that, wouldn't they?

19

have to go to.

20

So they'd go to Michigan and

We don't want to ask him about any
We want information that we

Your decree is too broad, so modify it.

MR. TRIBE:

And they'd be totally right in
So the issue is just what court they

Well, that's one way of putting it.

21

If that were the only issue, then I think this Court's

22

decision -- really several decisions.

23

decision of this Court, holds that a local venue rule like

24

the one Michigan has saying that you've got to go to the

25

original issuing court in order to make a change in a

Crider v. Zurich, a

1

decree or a judgment or an injunction, because that denies

2

the full faith and credit premise of the equal competence

3

of the courts of other States to entertain the matter,

4

that kind of venue rule is not entitled to full faith and

5

credit.
QUESTION:

6

Well, isn't another way to answer the

7

question to just say that it's not Baker's burden to undo

8

the injunction, it's G.M.'s burden to show that Baker is

9

bound, and it can't do that when Baker wasn't a party.
MR. TRIBE:

10
11

That's certainly right, Justice

Kennedy, and in fact -QUESTION:

12

That's precisely the issue,

13

because -- you might come to this when you want, but

14

what's worrying me is, if you require the Bakers to go to

15

Michigan you run into the problem that Justice Kennedy

16

raised.

Why should they have to go to Michigan?

17

MR. TRIBE:

18

QUESTION:

Yes.
All right.

But if you don't require

19

them to go to Michigan, you run into the possibility that

20

Elwell, the Elwells of the world, i.e., those under

21

injunctions,

22

then they'll really be in a mess because in -- you know,

23

you have one State telling them you have to do a thing and

24

another State saying you can't do a thing --

25

will get under conflicting injunctions, and

MR. TRIBE:

Well, the -8

QUESTION:

1

-- and that would produce a terrible

2

practical mess, so between those two evils, it seems

3

better to send them to Michigan.
MR. TRIBE:

4

Well, let me back into that, Justice

5

Breyer.

6

also don't agree that it's a hopeless clash of evils.

7

I certainly don't agree that that's better, and I

This very settlement took care of that.

There

8

was a side agreement that said that if he is ordered to

9

testify, then he cannot be sanctioned.

10

He, indeed, has

testified against G.M. in some 30 trials.
QUESTION:

11

Not once --

This is a really important point in

12

the case.

Let's just talk about conflicting injunctions.

be the answer if there were no settlement agreement?

15

Let's assume there's no settlement agreement.
What would

G.M. says, well -- or, Elwell says well, I'm

16

being told one thing in one State and the other thing in

17

the other State, and what's the answer to that?

18

MR. TRIBE:

Well, I think the answer is that

19

contempt requires a certain mens rea, and that in that

20

case he cannot be held in contempt for following the order

21

of a court that appears to have competent jurisdiction -QUESTION:

22

Well, doesn't the Missouri court also

23

have the capacity to instruct G.M. not to enforce the

24

injunction against Elwell in defiance of Missouri's

25

orders?

MR. TRIBE:

1

I think that's certainly right.

2

G.M. has to be before the Missouri court to create the

3

problem.

4

was with a side agreement that eliminated the very problem

5

that the Court --

In this case, the way it was indeed structured

QUESTION:

6

But what I'm actually worried is not

7

this case.

I'm worried about custody cases, antitrust

8

cases, dozens of cases in which very complicated

9

injunctive decrees could have been entered against

10

defendants in State 1, and then grandma in Florida in a

11

custody case, or any supplier in an antitrust case

12

produces a different action in Florida and puts Alcoa or

13

Swift or mummy or daddy or somebody under a conflicting

14

injunctive decree, and that's what I'm worried about.

15

MR. TRIBE:

Well, but I do think first there's

16

obviously a certain wisdom in taking these one case at a

17

time, and it seems to me very clear that in a case like

18

this, where it is just wordplay to say that this is not

19

being used against the Bakers, that they're not being

20

bound, of course they are.

21

procedures that would otherwise be available to get this

22

evidence, and the only thing that's being invoked to

23

deprive them of it, in a sense a legal defense to their

24

claim, is the Michigan judgment.

25

just as in --

They are being deprived of the

QUESTION:

1

That's what full faith and credit

2

always produces, some result like that.

3

Michigan decree hadn't involved testimony.

4

involved a car, and you go to Missouri and you say well,

5

why should this Missouri creditor be denied the resort to

6

Missouri courts over this claim to a car?

7

MR. TRIBE:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Supposing the
Suppose it

Well, what -And the answer is, full faith and

credit.
MR. TRIBE:

Well, Chief Justice Rehnquist, this

11

Court in in personam as opposed to in rem cases, where

12

there is, in fact, a finite object and it has to be

13

allocated, and once it is you can't continually relitigate

14

it, has never held that we can simply let the chips fall

15

where they may when a judgment has been entered not over

16

an object but over knowledge in someone's head, a judgment

17

that says we're going to say you can't testify it.

18

That is, in Martin v. Wilks it could also have

19

been said in response to your opinion for the court could

20

also have been said, well, consent decrees often have side

21

effects and, indeed, the way that General Motors tries to

22

make this look like anything other than an easy case is to

23

suggest that the decree is only being enforced against Mr.

24

Elwell, and that my clients are simply in the wrong place

25

at the wrong time, or their mother was in that car.

1

Now, that, I think, is sheer sophistry.

2

not true, because unlike a judgment that changes something

3

physical, it reduces the assets available, it eliminates a

4

job, this judgment has effect on the Bakers only because

5

it is used to preclude them from arguing to the court in

6

Missouri that they are entitled to have Elwell's

7

testimony.

8

absentee adjudication of their rights.

9

Court has never allowed.

10

It has preclusive effect.

QUESTION:

It's

It involves the
That's what this

Mr. Tribe, would you distinguish what

11

12

incidental effect.

13

14

Creditor 2 comes along, just as good a case, tough luck.

15

It's like, creditor 1 sues debtor, and

MR. TRIBE:

Right, and this, Justice Ginsburg,

16

is nothing like that.

17

judgment can be for some people a natural disaster.

The

18

landscape has changed and you can't reconstruct it.

The

19

judgment in this case didn't change anything physical.

20

It's not, for example, as though this was a judgment that

21

Mr. Elwell did something terrible and should be executed

22

in the State of Michigan which would, of course, render

23

him unavailable.

24
25

A case like that shows that a

The only way -- just -- you have to ask
yourself, I think, what the causal chain is.

Their

argument is, so what, too bad, the judgment in Michigan

has made this fellow essentially unavailable, just as

3

though he were incarcerated.

the Federal rules, one could at least depose him.

But of course then, under

5

The fact is, if you ask, what's the causal chain

6

by which he was made unavailable, he's unavailable only to

7

the extent -- and this goes back to Justice Kennedy's

8

question -- that General Motors' request to the judge in

9

the State of Missouri that the judgment in Michigan be

10

treated as preclusive of the rights of the litigants in

11

Missouri, who weren't there, weren't represented, weren't

12

privies, had no notice, it's only to the extent that that

13

request is granted.

14

QUESTION:

But if Elwell really is not

15

available, then couldn't you, on behalf of the Bakers,

16

introduce Elwell's testimony from the Georgia case, where

17

he did testify, I think about the same defect.

18

MR. TRIBE:

Well, the testimony about the Ivey

19

memorandum was particularly helpful here, and rather

20

damning, I think, to General Motors, but certainly one

21

ought not to be -- it's really -- the idea that there are

22

second best solutions all build on the wrong premise, that

23

you can bind them to this decree, bind in a strictly

24

technical, legal sense.

25

That is, Justice Stevens, for example, in the

dissent in Martin v. Wilks came up with a possible way

2

that a consent decree in a case like that might be used

against the other side without really binding them.

here.

The decree is being brought to bear fully on the

9

only people who are hurt by it.

It's not being enforced

10

against Mr. Elwell, who's never sanctioned.

11

structure of the situation is that General Motors obtains

12

a settlement in which it has a chance to argue to courts

13

around the country you ought to prevent the plaintiffs in

14

these cases from getting this evidence that they could

15

otherwise get, to which they would be entitled under the

16

Federal rules, not because you have a right to some

17

kind of evidence in the abstract, but because you have an

18

entitlement to use the rules in place.

The entire

If we were to rule in your favor and

cite the Full Faith and Credit Clause, would we also have

21

to talk about due process, or would we say that the Full

principles of the law of judgments, and that Baker is just

That is, and this Court's precedents make clear

QUESTION:

We don't have any square holding.

We've intimated that in some of the cases, I think.
MR. TRIBE:

Well, I -- there's certainly

alternative holding in -- some of the earlier cases before

10

the 1970's, when the Court began positivizing procedural

11

due process, there were cases, a fair number of them,

12

including Hansberry v. Lee and others, in which the

13

language of the Court is that it has been a principle

14

since time immemorial that people are not bound by

15

judgments in proceedings that they don't have a chance to

16

participate in, and occasionally the phrase, full faith

17

and credit, has entered those opinions.

18

But that has been axiomatic throughout.

You

19

only reach procedural due process if you think that

20

Congress for some reason in section 1738 departed from

21

that normal understanding of full faith and credit and the

22

law of judgments, in which case we argue that it would

23

have been a deprivation of property in the form of an

24

entitlement to invoke the procedural rules, much like

25

Logan v. Zimmerman, without due process, even considering

the way you said you did.

created entitlement to invoke the rules, I don't think --

about some takings argument.

The Anti-Injunction Act and the Younger doctrine

2

means the Federal courts can't presume inadequacy on the

part of the State courts, and this Court's decisions in

4

Donovan v. Dallas and General Atomic indicate, too, that a

State court cannot tell litigants, even litigants in its

courts, that they may not invoke certain procedures in a

Federal court.
In General Atomic it wasn't even an antisuit

injunction.

They were being told that they could not use

Rule 14 as an impleader.
This case is a classic example of that.

11

12

Essentially, if the Eighth Circuit's use of the decree

13

from Michigan is affirmed, it will follow that the courts

14

of a State can not only make decisions that will have res

17

will follow that the courts of a State can control who can

QUESTION:

Mr. Tribe, can I ask you a question

about your understanding of the meaning of the injunction?

8

There's some difference between the side agreement that

says we won't seek contempt charges if you testify and the

10

text of the injunction itself.
Do you agree that the injunction in effect says
to the -- this witness, if you are subpoenaed to testify

3

or ordered by a court in another State to testify, you

4

shall not comply with that order?

MR. TRIBE:

The answer is yes.

doesn't resolve the ambiguity.

Well, I think that's right as well.
But you don't seem to make that

MR. TRIBE:

Well, we make it indirectly in the

point that I was elaborating to Justice Ginsburg.

That

is, if it is true that the courts of the united States and

8

of the various States are not authorized to put people in

9

this circumstance and in effect to make inroads in the

internal operation of the systems of other States and of

the Federal Government, then this order is completely void

independent of the nonparty status of the Bakers.

picked up on it and I'm going to try to answer both of

2

you, and Mr. Chief Justice, you raised the other ground,

3

and probably the simplest reason is that ultimately by the

4

application of full faith and credit here we are just

5

talking about what court will decide whether or not in

6

this case Elwell will be allowed to testify.

7
8

9

That's the application of full faith and credit,
and that -QUESTION:

The application of full faith and

10

credit as far as I know, in all the history of that

11

clause, this Court has never even said that full faith and

12

credit is owed to a decree ordering a person to do an act.

13

Indeed, wasn't it entirely clear under the

14

regime that existed until the thirties under the First

15

Restatement of Conflicts that a granting or denying -- and

16

I'm reading you from the First Restatement section 449 --

17

granting or denying equitable relief other than in order

18

to pay money is a matter of discretion, and the decision

19

of one court to give specific relief will not limit

20

another court and thus exclude the use of discretion by

21

the second court.

22

That was talking even as between the two parties

was quite plain that the order requiring the husband to

2

convey the land was entitled to full faith and credit, and

3

second, we cite a number of lower court cases in our

4

briefs, including from the Seventh Circuit, that

5

established that this is a fairly well-settled issue that

6

full faith and credit is entitled to injunctions, both

7

prohibitory injunctions and affirmative injunctions.

8

9
10
11

QUESTION:

But in all events, the other problem

is that you're trying to make this applicable to Baker,
and Baker is simply not bound.
Now, if G.M. finds itself in the position of

12

Elwell testifying, and it tries to hold Elwell in contempt

13

back in Michigan, would Elwell have a defense on some sort

14

of due process grounds, do you think, that he was ordered

15

to do what the Missouri court told him to do because due

16

process concerns and full faith and credit concerns simply

17

did not allow the injunction to be enforced?

18

MR. CAPPUCCIO:

No, sir.

He would be in

19

contempt of the injunction.

20

here, and the problem here is to 1) ask what sort of

21

effect is this having on third parties, and is that effect

22

so great as to violate due process, or does it leave them

with a way to defend their rights in a manner that is

have to pin it on some due process --

5

Can't we just ask whether this is

MR. CAPPUCCIO:

Why do we

Well, Your Honor, because the

6

application of full faith and credit is fairly

7

straightforward here, and this picks up on another

8

question you had.

9

The full faith and credit statute says that the

10

Michigan injunction is entitled to the very same force and

11

effect that it would have within the State of Michigan.

12

That's common ground.

3

The Michigan courts, we were fortunate in this

4

case, have interpreted the force and effect of this very

5

injunction, and the case that we cite in the red brief is

6

the Brisborne case, and what second courts who people have

7

gone to have said is that the force and effect that this

8

injunction is due is that Ron Elwell is prohibited from

9

testifying unless and until somebody goes back and

20

presents their claim to the Wayne County, Michigan court

21

to allow him to testify.

But as Justice O'Connor was

it seems to me it's also different because of

the fundamental law of judgments, which is that you can't
apply a judgment or enforce a judgment against a person -against -- where there was no personal jurisdiction over

MR. CAPPUCCIO:
QUESTION:

Well, that --

It's just a simple personal

jurisdiction.
MR. CAPPUCCIO:

as to whether these people are being bound by the judgment
rather than being affected by the judgment in some
incidental way, but I think that bound debate, which the

The whole purpose was to say, in effect, Michigan rules
the world.

It determines what evidence will be admissible

in courts all across the country, although -- and I think
you'll agree with me that to this extent the Restatement
of Conflicts is right -- each State applies its own rules
to determine the admissibility of evidence.

ordinary operation of the rules of evidence of all the

Michigan deciding something between Ron Elwell and General
Motors and preventing Elwell from hurting General Motors.
What makes this apply elsewhere is the Full
Faith and Credit Clause, nothing that the Michigan court
did, and what that says is, we have decided as a Nation
because someone can step over the line and hurt General
Motors just as well in another State, that the -- that

Michigan has the power to drag somebody in Alaska, in
Hawaii, and say you can't -- plaintiff, you can't choose

You have to come to Michigan to litigate.

The scene that I get from what Michigan -- what you are
attempting to extract from this Michigan judgment is in

Tobago rules the world, only now it's Michigan is going to
decide what evidence comes in all over.
MR. CAPPUCCIO:

I understand that, and I lay

that at the feet of the U.S. Congress, and they were wise
to have done that.

That is what section 1738 does.

order a litigant before it to refuse to comply with any
normally lawful court order that might be entered anywhere
else in the country?

Does that bother you at all?

I'm just looking -- I'm not looking about third
parties.
MR. CAPPUCCIO:
QUESTION:

I understand.

I'm just looking just at Elwell.

You

are saying to him if -- under your reading of the
injunction, as I understand it, it in effect says no
matter how lawful the court order may be that directs you
to testify, you must refuse on pain of contempt.
MR. CAPPUCCIO:

I agree.

He would be in

contempt if he did that.
QUESTION:

And you think it's perfectly clear

that there's no jurisdictional issue as to the power of a
court to enter such an order as required full -- must be
given full faith and credit.
MR. CAPPUCCIO:

I can't imagine what the

jurisdictional issue would be.

subject matter, and they entered an injunction that
prevents Elwell from testifying against General Motors.

You would -- I assume that the Court would agree

not be recognized or enforced in a sister State if such

We agree that that third person

MR. CAPPUCCIO:

Well, Your Honor, there are two

12

questions, and let me try to answer the first one and then

13

the second one.

14

The first -- the answer to the first one is, it

15

does not matter whether you say they are bound or not

16

bound.

17

requires.

18

That is a legal conclusion about what due process

What matters is the degree of impact on him.

19

Does it affect a property right, and I agree with the

extend Logan v. Zimmerman.

22

right here.

23

They don't have a property

That disposes of this case.

But even if it does, what process are they

24

entitled to, and the only question is, is it too much of a

25

burden to send them back to Michigan, and I'm saying no -50

It's the same exact burden that a litigant faces

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

3

MR. TRIBE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

4

Let me begin by saying that the power of

5

Congress in response to Martin v. Wilks to have a national

6

venue provision has nothing to do with the power of a

7

State to say, come back to Michigan though you've never

8

been here.
Congress was not acting in connection with full

9
10

faith and credit.

What Congress was doing was exactly

11

analogous to Michigan's in-State rule saying venue is in

12

the court that did it in the first place.
QUESTION:

13

Mr. Tribe, I don't understand one

14

thing about your position.

15

that the -- that courts in States other than Michigan are

16

not bound by the judgment, but that also, if he complies

17

with the decrees of these other courts, that Mr. Elwood is

18

not liable for contempt in Michigan?

19

MR. TRIBE:

No.

Is it your position not only

parties are effectively bound, that's my problem.

sanctions imposed on him as he travels around the country

orders.

That would be a matter of contract between
