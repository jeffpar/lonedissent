ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK W. BARNETT

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. BARNETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The case that is before the Court today involves

11

the question of whether an 1894 Act of Congress had the

12

intent and the effect of disestablishing the Yankton Sioux

13

Reservation.

14

conclusively yes.

15

factors, the first and not least of which is the use of

16

"cession and sum certain" language in the operative -- or

17

terms -- in the operative section of the agreement and the

18

ratifying Act.

19

The State submits that the answer is
And we base that "yes" on several

That particular "cession and sum certain," the

20

cession, sale, relinquishment and conveyance of all

21

interests in and to the unalloted land, together with the

22

sum certain, has been held by this Court to create an

23

almost insurmountable presumption, or a nearly conclusive

24

presumption.

25

in combination with the immediate uptake of jurisdiction

And we would submit to the Court that that,

1

by the State of South Dakota in 1895, and continuously

2

uncontested State jurisdiction during the next 100 years,

3

and throwing that together with the fact that that

4

jurisdiction was exercised without objection by the Tribe

5

and without an attempt to exercise jurisdiction by the

6

Tribe or the Federal Government throughout those 100

7

years, and that's not merely our contention but that also

8

is the observation -- excuse me -- of both the Eighth

9

Circuit and the -- both the majority and dissenting

10

opinion, as well as the opinion of the unanimous State of

11

South Dakota Supreme Court.

12

method of telling us what everybody understood at the time

13

that this Act was passed, pursuant to the agreement with

14

the Yankton Tribe, was what I will call the immediate

15

wholesale settlement of the area by homesteaders, or what

16

the District Court referred to as the rapid settlement and

17

the loss -- the quick loss of Indian character in this

18

area, which would suggest, at least to the State, that

19

that would suggest disestablishment.

And then, add into that, as a

20

We also would submit to you that additional --

21

QUESTION:

May I ask you, General Barnett, you

22

use the word "disestablishment," but as I read

23

particularly Judge Magill's decision, his dissenting

24

opinion, he's very careful to speak always about

25

diminishing.

And you seem to use those words as though

1

they mean the same thing.
MR. BARNETT:

2

Your Honor, I believe that

3

diminishment probably should be read to suggest a case

4

more like Rosebud v. Kneip, where the Court said that as

5

to several counties, the reservation was disestablished,

6

but it still left one county with a compact square of

7

reservation.

8

1151(a)-type reservation country out there, but it was

9

diminished in size.

And so there was still actually 18 U.S.C.,

The case that we have here today -- and I think

10
11

the parties would agree -- that the case we are doing

12

today is disestablishment, just like the DeCoteau case,

13

where the Lake Traverse Reservation was found by this

14

Court to be disestablished, meaning there was still no

15

1151-type -- 1151(a)-type reservation out there.

16

I -- I might add, Your Honor, that diminishment

17

and disestablishment at one time were probably not terms

18

of art.

19

today here litigating disestablishment.

20

In our view, they are now.

QUESTION:

And we are, I think,

Even though Judge Magill said that he

21

thought that the District Court erred in holding that the

22

reservation had not been diminished?

23

MR. BARNETT:

Yes.

And I -- and I do not

24

believe, from reading all of Judge Magill's opinion, that

25

he's trying to suggest that some 1151(a)-type reservation

1

still existed after 1894.

I think, to be honest, I would

2

suggest to you that -- that he was probably using

3

diminishment and disestablishment interchangeably, and

4

that has happened in the history of the -- of the court

5

system in other cases as well.
Returning for a moment, if I may, to the

6

7

settlement history that took place out there -- and the

8

reason I bring it up is because this Court, on other

9

occasions, has looked to the settlement history

10

immediately after the passage of the Opening Act to help

11

it determine what did everybody understand at the time.

12

And in this case, as was suggested by the Court of Claims

13

in 1980 -- or as was found by that Court -- within 3 years

14

of the opening of this reservation, more than 100,000 of

15

these opened acres had been sold.

16

percent had been sold.

17

Within 5 years, 90

And as you will see at joint appendix 475, by

18

1913, in addition to the ceded lands which had been put up

19

for settlement by the homesteaders, more than two-thirds

20

of the allotted lands left to the Indians in 1894 had also

21

been sold.

22

And so -QUESTION:

General Barnett, was the particular

23

tract of land that we're concerned with in this case part

24

of the land that was restored to the public domain by the

25

1892 agreement?

MR. BARNETT:

1

Yes, Your Honor, we do contend

2

that it was restored to the public domain.

3

explanation, at the time of trial, 90 percent of all of

4

the land in what we call the disputed area, 90 percent of

5

that former reservation area was in non-Indian hands.

6

Which has been something that the Court has noted in its

7

prior cases.

8

the population was non-Indian, as found by the Federal

9

census.

10
11

12

And by way of

And more than two-thirds, or 68 percent, of

QUESTION:

So this parcel was not allotted land

that was later alienated?
MR. BARNETT:

168,000 acres of the 430 --

13

168,000 were immediately ceded to the Federal Government,

14

and then, then, as I said, began a rapid process of sale.

15

And then the allotments, which were the balance of the

16

430, were, in large part, sold in the ensuing years.

17

about the next 15 or 20 years, a great majority of the

18

allotments were sold.

19
20

QUESTION:

Yeah, we were asking about this

particular tract of land.

QUESTION:

Yes.

And its history.

site of a proposed waste site or something.

What was the history of this tract?

MR. BARNETT:

7

Excuse me, Your Honor.

It was -- it was -- it is now and

8

was at the time of trial fee land.

It was issued by a

government patent, issued by the Federal Government.

1

different than that which we have seen in other treaties

2

or agreements.

3

MR. BARNETT:

Yes, Your Honor.

4

The -- as we look at Article XVIII, it seems to

5

the State that the one thing that you cannot do with

6

Article XVIII is read it literally.

7

it literally, in the strict literal interpretation, then

8

it says that nothing in this Act in effect -- or in

9

agreement

10

happen.

Because if you read

in 1892 actually happened.

The sale did not

The white homesteaders could not move in.
Part of the 1858 treaty forbade settlers or

11

12

other whites from coming onto the reservation, with

13

certain narrow exceptions.

14

And that was in 1858.

By contrast, in the 1892, and in the Act

15

ratifying it, the exact opposite purpose was there,

16

that -- that we are going to have whites come in and

17

settle this area.

18

what Article XVIII says, I think, first, that the -- and I

19

suspect the parties would even agree -- it cannot be read

20

literally.

21

And -- and so, when we try to interpret

Because then you get absurd results.
The second thing that I would observe about

22

Article XVIII is that if you read the first sentence of

23

Article XVIII, it says:

24

the 1858 treaty -- or nothing in this agreement.

25

Nothing in this treaty abrogates

If that's true, all the rest of Article XVIII is

surplus.

If you go to the first phrase in the second

2

sentence, it repeats that phrase, that -- that essential

3

statement.

4

came after is surpluses.

5

And if that's true, what came before and what

And so it seems to me that it can't be read

6

literally.

And -- and that takes us to the next point,

7

which is, how does the Federal Government propose to us

8

that it should -- or to you -- that it should be read?

9

And if I understand their argument in their briefs

10

correctly, they're suggesting that you need to read into

11

Article XVIII the phrase "not inconsistent."

12

And they go to Article I and II and suggest that

3

I and II is not really a cession and sum certain, contrary

4

to its express language, but is -- and, in fact, I would

5

submit to you they are asking you to read out cession and

6

sum certain.

left.

9

And take that out, and then construe what is

And -- and I don't think that that is the
appropriate way to handle it.

And, in fact, I would -- I

20

would suggest that the Klamath case had an analogous

21

situation, where there was a savings clause in that case,

22

which suggested that nothing in the -- in the more modern

23

agreement was to -- was to take away rights they had

24

preserved in the past.

25

out, the later agreement constituted a cession and sum

But as the Klamath court pointed

1

certain, and that the Klamath Tribe could not silently

2

preserve hunting and fishing rights through a general --

3

the general language of a savings clause.

4

Now, I would also submit to the Court that when

5

we look at 18, at the tail end of this agreement, or when

6

you look at it -- excuse me -- I would suggest to you that

7

it is important that that is not the operative language of

8

the -- of the agreement or the Act.

9

would -- I would call your attention to the Hagen case,

And, in fact, I

10

where the Court said that, in observing on the Solem case,

11

observed that the use of the words "public domain" in the

12

Solem case were not found in the operative language of the

13

Act.

14

language, they had, I think, secondary importance.

And since they were not found in the operative

Or as the Court --

operative language?

Why -- why isn't this in the

Right.
Because I don't think they

21

intended to disestablish -- excuse me -- I think they

22

intended to disestablish, and I don't think that -- that

23

they intended Article XVIII to -- to change what the terms

24

or the operative intent of the Act were.

25

I think that Article XVIII was there to reassure

1

the Tribe that they would receive the monies and the

2

claims that they felt were due them -- the annuities.
QUESTION:

3
4

Then why didn't they just say that

and nothing else?
MR. BARNETT:

5

Well, I think, as one justice

6

said -- or judge said -- at the Eighth Circuit, lawyers

7

repeat themselves.

8

what was happening was the Indians were concerned that --

9

that the Federal Government was not going to live up to

And I suspect that -- that probably

10

its obligations, and particularly when they understood

11

they were selling the -- the remaining reservation that

12

they had received in the 1858 treaty, it seems to me that

13

a fair question that would have been in the Indians minds

14

was:

15

treaty from which our annuities flow?

16

would be:

17

treaty, and you will get your annuities.

18

Are you going to abrogate that portion of the 1858
And the answer

No, we are not going to abrogate the 1858

And, indeed, if you look at the report that the

19

commissioner gave to the State of Interior, who then filed

20

with the Congress, in 1893, what you will see is a -- is a

21

lengthy description in the record about what all of the

22

Indians concerns were and how these were resolved in the

23

various articles of the agreement.

24

long discussion about Pipestone Quarry and a long

25

discussion about scout claims for Indians who had served

And so there was a

1

as scouts and felt they still had money owing.

2

discussion about their concerns.

A lot of

No discussion about preserving boundaries or

3
4

authority, in the first place.

5

when we come to -- to what the negotiator is telling

6

Congress the Indians feel about 18, it gets one sentence,

7

and one sentence only in the record.

8

is -- with regard to 18, his comment is:

9

1858 is not abrogated and the Indians shall get their

10
11

And in the second place,

And what he says
The Treaty of

annuities.
And so that suggests to me that -- that if the

12

Tribe really did think and believe that they were going to

13

preserve their boundaries and their authority, number one,

14

that's a glaring conflict with the cession and sum certain

15

language; and, number two, is completely unsupported in

16

the congressional and in the negotiating record.

17

QUESTION:

May I ask this question about Article

18

I and -- and also Justice Ginsburg's question of

19

distinction between dis -- disestablishment and -- and

20

diminishment.

21

they cede, and so forth and so on, their interest in and

22

all the unalloted lands within the limits of the

23

reservation -- set apart -- doesn't that kind of convey a

message -- I don't know -- if you don't know the

geography -- that there's some un - - unalloted lands

That when you say -- when the sentence says

the use of the phrase "within the reservation" -QUESTION:

MR. BARNETT:

-- does not suggest to us -- given

11

the fact that it's right in a cession and sum certain does

not suggest to us that a reservation is going to continue.

It is simply a reference to what area it is that we are

ceding and disestablishing.

attention to the DeCoteau case, with the Lake Traverse

16

Sissetons and Titowan Tribe, identical Article I and II,

17

word for word.

And it used the same phrase, "within the

18

And yet this Court held, as you know, that

19

that reservation was disestablished.

20

And I would call your

And I would also submit to you, Your Honor,

21

that -- that this is consistent with what the Indians have

22

understood for the first 100 years, as evidenced by their

23

own constitutions, particularly the 1962 constitution,

24

which tells us something about what the Indians felt.

And you're arguing those lands

We are also arguing that --

Now, what is it that -- that changes

the status of the allotted land in your theory?
MR. BARNETT:

I believe that we are adhering to

20

the teaching of the DeCoteau case, where the DeCoteau

21

case, at 420 U.S., 446, in footnote 2, talks about when

22

you cede the authority, the governmental authority, that

23

you have over an area -- and -- or, in this case, to use

24

the exact language -- cede all interest -- with that goes

25

the authority not just over the immediately ceded, but in

the entire region.

Court said that what was intended to be left by Congress

3

was the allotted lands -- the allotted and trust lands.

4

And under the Pelican case and under

(b) and (c), what we know today is that when there is a

cession and sum certain, the authority is lost.

And, indeed, in the DeCoteau case, the

See, the part that I'm having

9

four subsquares within the big square.

MR. BARNETT:

QUESTION:

Yes.

Now, suppose that a particular treaty

1

So that your argument there is not

that the jurisdiction was lost by the cession language as

such, but by the application of some other rule -- and I

4

think it's the some other rule that I'm not clear about.
MR. BARNETT:

5

Well, I think it's a reflection,

6

Your Honor, of when we look at 1151(a),

(b) and (c), those

7

are a codification of law that had been developing ever

8

since the -- I believe the Bates v. Clark case back in the

9

1870's.

And I think what the courts have said as they've

10

looked at this question is, is that, did Congress intend

11

to disestablish the reservation?

12

disestablish the reservation, then the courts have been

13

uniform, they have been uniform in concluding that not

14

only is there a loss of authority or jurisdiction as to

15

the lands immediately ceded, but they are also taking the

16

position -- and this is consistent with the philosophy of

17

the Allotment Act, the -- in the Yakima v. Yakima Indian

MR. ABOUREZK:

5
6

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

7

In the 1858 treaty -- and I'd like to go back to

8

that, if I may -- the Tribe gave up 11 million acres of

9

land to the United States Government.

These were enormous

10

property rights and sovereignty rights that they bargained

11

away in exchange for a 430,000-acre homeland, a

12

reservation that they believed was going to be their

13

permanent home in perpetuity.

14

annuities.

15

They -- they also got

They got some cash -- I think $1.6 million.
But this 430,000 acres was their land that they

16

wanted to retain the Indian character.

17

retain this land forever.

18

along, after the allotments in 1892, and said we want to

19

buy what's left over from you, the surplus lands, the

20

Tribe held on so dearly to this 1858 treaty, to their

21

boundaries, to the reservation and their annuities that

22

they refused actually to sign the 1892 agreement until the

23

Federal Government said, okay, we're going to give you

the liquor provision that you've asked for.

Now, the State has been arguing disestablishment

and diminishment.

And they use the terms interchangeably.

They have in their briefs.

for is not just diminishment, which would be the case

And what they're really asking

10

Justice Breyer brought up, that would be carving out a

11

discrete portion or a discrete parcel of the reservation

12

and saying, okay, this is now no longer here, so the

13

reservation boundaries are diminished.

Even if it is only a diminishment

rather than a disestablishment, wouldn't the parcel here

be in the portion that was diminished -- that is, it was

taken away from the Tribe?

Yes, it would be.

that when all of the unalloted lands in a reservation are

As I understand it the claim is that --

MR. ABOUREZK:

Respectfully, there's only one

change made in the -- between the 1858 Treaty and the '94

MR. ABOUREZK:

8

9

Well --

Justice Ginsburg, if you read the

entire agreement and the statute of 1894, what my position

10

is -- our position is that the presumption is in favor of

11

maintaining the reservation boundaries because of what

12

Article XVIII, Article XVII, and the school --

QUESTION:

Then the presumption that's created

14

by the cession and sum certain clause is rebutted in your

view?
MR. ABOUREZK:

It's not only rebutted, but it

shifts -- the burden of proof then shifts to the State or

the people trying to abolish the reservation.

think they've met that burden.

for a sum certain, there's an almost insurmountable

else's reading, either -- either of which is plausible.
MR. ABOUREZK:

QUESTION:

But there's nothing in there,

it, to suggest that this kind of jurisdiction was being

exercised over either allotted lands or the lands that

were conveyed in 18 -- or under the -- under the 1892

agreement?
MS. MCDOWELL:

7

The record is unclear as to

8

whether the State or the Tribe or the Federal Government

9

was exercising jurisdiction over the allotted lands at the

10

time.

It appears that the only prosecution that is cited

11

from the early era, one in 1895, may well have been on

Indian allocated lands.

reading of the record.

It does not appear clear from my

More significantly, however, the exercise of

say to be the -- the -- the -- the understanding, that --

that you can't have a -- the reservation went with -- with

MS. MCDOWELL:

9

Oh, the Court has acknowledged

10

that in a number of other cases, including Solem, that at

11

the time, the understanding was that Indian status was a

12

property status, but that Congress disabused everyone of

13

that notion in 1948, and that when we are deciding these

14

disestablishment and diminishment issues, we are looking

15

at reservations as they have been considered after '48,

16

and not as they may have been considered 100 years ago.

MR. BARNETT:

5

Well, obviously, if you were to

it would have a big effect on criminal jurisdiction.

the best example I can give you is that if you were the
