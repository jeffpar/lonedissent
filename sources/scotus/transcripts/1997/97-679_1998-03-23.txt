ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. CARPENTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question in this case is whether the Ninth
Circuit correctly held that the statutory filed tariff

3

requirements, here codified in section 203 of the

4

Communications Act, apply only to rates and not to the

5

services provided in exchange for those rates.

6

The answer to this question is that the holding

7

is simply wrong.

8

rates, but they also prohibit, among other things, any

9

untariffed privilege or facility in communication and any

The statutory terms are not limited to

20

form of rebate, and this Court has held many times that

21

it's an unlawful rebate and preference in violation of

22

these prohibitions for a carrier to provide a service or

23

to enforce a service guarantee that is not covered by the

24

carrier's tariff.

25

And this case also lacks the element that made

1

the recent Maislin and MCI v. ATT cases close questions in

2

this Court, for no Federal agency responsible for the

3

administration of these requirements has ever suggested

4

the Ninth Circuit's interpretation, much less endorsed it

5

as advancing some other legitimate statutory goal.
The reality is, is that in situations where

6

7

tariffing requirements have applied and should continue to

8

apply, and the Federal agencies have found that there are

9

many, the Ninth Circuit's holding would create the very

10

discrimination in rates that everyone, even our opponent,

11

concedes to be the purpose of this requirement.
Under the holding, carriers could evade the

12

13

prohibitions not by misquoting the rates, but by

14

misquoting the service, making service guarantees that

15

aren't in the tariff, and when they're breached excusing

16

the carrier from paying tariff charges and paying an

17

amount of money that would represent the damages for the

18

breach.

21

QUESTION:

Do we take the case as if there had

been no violation of the Federal statute 201 through 207?
MR. CARPENTER:

Yes, Your Honor.

There was no

22

claim litigated there is any violation of those

23

provisions.

24

it was a State law breach of contract, an intentional

25

interference with tortious relationships, with business

The only claims that were litigated is that

1

relationships for ATT to fail to provide COT with the

2

quality of regulated long distance service that COT

3

claimed it had been promised.

4

QUESTION:

Are there cases which tell us that a

5

State law, the State law of torts, say, inform the

6

construction of reasonableness under the Federal statute?

7

That is to say, if there were an interference with an

8

advantageous business relation, that this would carry over

9

to show that this is an unreasonable implementation of the

10

tariffs under the Federal statute?

11

MR. CARPENTER:

There's no limitation on the

12

things that the FCC can consider in deciding whether a

13

difference in treatment is unjust and unreasonable, for

14

example, for purposes of the prohibition of section 202(a)

15

of the Communications Act.
Similarly, I don't think there would be any

16
17

limitation on the factors that it could consider in

18

deciding whether something's unjust and unreasonable -QUESTION:

19

You're saying that AT&T, then, is

20

immune from any sort of intentional interference with

21

business relationship action brought against it by anyone

22

who it had a contractual relationship with.

23

extreme.

24
25

MR. CARPENTER:

That seems

No, that's not -- that is not

our position.

1

First, there are a whole range of intentional

2

and nonintentional torts that don't arise out of the

3

carrier-customer relationship and the fortuity that

4

someone happens to be our customer wouldn't immunize us

5

from a tort action if that -- if a customer were a victim

6

of such a tort.

7

Second, with respect to things that arise out of

8

the customer-carrier relationship, we are under a series

9

of duties under the Communications Act.

10

QUESTION:

I realize that, but you would be

11

immune in many respects from an ordinary suit, say in

12

State court based on State court tort law.

13

MR. CARPENTER:

Absolutely, if it involved the

14

rates that we charge for our communications service or the

15

obligations that we incur in exchange for the receipt of

16

those payments.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. CARPENTER:

19

QUESTION:

Well, I was asking because I -Yes.

-- I have some of the concerns

20

indicated by the Chief Justice's question, whether or not

21

in interpreting what is reasonable under the Federal

22

statute, lower courts or the agency has said, well, this

23

is an interference with an advantageous business

24

relationship under State tort law, and that informs our

25

judgment as to what is unreasonable.

1

MR. CARPENTER:

That's -- that would be entirely

2

legitimate, but, of course, the Federal statute has to be

3

interpreted uniformly.

4

Let me maybe put some of these questions to rest

5

right now.

6

resellers with service that was inferior in quality to

7

that that the commercial customers had received, we would

8

have violated 202 of the Communications Act and we would

9

have been liable to it for the damages we caused.

10
11

If AT&T had deliberately provided COT, other

Now, those damages would have been determined
under the Federal standards of the act.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. CARPENTER:

14

suits can be brought either place.

15

of the dispute over the scope of the duty it could be

16

referred to the FCC under primary jurisdiction, but those

17

suits can be brought in either the Federal district court

18

or at the FCC.

19

QUESTION:

In a Federal court, or by the FCC?
Either place.

Obviously, the

If they're a question

What if the -- what if AT&T decides

20

that Central Telephone is not simply a customer but a

21

competitor?

MR. CARPENTER:

Central Telephone is a

competitor.
QUESTION:

And then decides simply to drive it

out of business?

1

If we had done that and did it

by providing it with worse service than it was entitled to

MR. CARPENTER:

It might have a Federal antitrust remedy in some

effect of that is to give them a preference over other

principle to the very limit of its logic.

QUESTION:

7

MR. CARPENTER:

907,

I've read that, yes.
-- Abilene case, the question

8

there was whether a State law that had the identical

9

substantive prohibitions as the Federal statute could

20

be -- could be applied to define the regulated carrier's

2

obligation to its customer.

22

The Court said, even if the substantive

23

standards are the same it's inevitable that different

24

States will apply those substantive standards in different

25

ways, and that would defeat the uniformity that is the

cases of field preemption, where --

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. CARPENTER:

10

So --

QUESTION:

But that was certainly a much less of

an expansive preemption than you're arguing for here.

13

MR. CARPENTER:

14

QUESTION:

15

There was a common law right to

be charged only a reasonable rate.

11
12

It was a case involving whether

Well --

You say an intentional tort is

preempted.

16

MR. CARPENTER:

Your Honor, an intentional tort

17

is preempted only if the predicate for it is, is that the

18

customer didn't receive the quality of service that it was

19

entitled to in exchange for the payment of the tariffed

20

rate.

QUESTION:

Well, why couldn't it -- can it be

brought, then -- could the claims of intentional

best efforts to provide the services they had contracted

2

for by the time they contracted to provide it, so that at

3

least with respect to these two State causes of action

4

there would have been a Federal remedy?

5

MR. CARPENTER:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

They

6

could have sued us for violation of the tariff.

7

if they had sued us on that basis we would have gotten

8

summary judgment.

9

QUESTION:

I think

If there had been a close question -Of the claims -- I take it you're

10

conceding that they would have stated claims under the

11

tariff --

12

MR. CARPENTER:

13

QUESTION:

14

Absolutely.

-- if they had been brought under the

tariff.
MR. CARPENTER:

15

Absolutely.

I don't think it's

16

the case that the tariff could have been invoked, because

17

our only duty is to make reasonable effort at the due date

18

we meet and not to -- and to allow them to cancel if we

19

miss it by more than 45 days, but they certainly can sue

20

us whenever we make a service guarantee in a tariff and

21

breach it.

That -QUESTION:

22

Mr. Carpenter, is it possible that

23

you can make a service guarantee that was not covered by a

24

tariff?

It's invalid.

QUESTION:

Well, you -- in your briefs you

describe network billing and multilocation billing --

MR. CARPENTER:

-- as not covered by the tariffs.
There's a terminological issue

there.

10

Multilocation billing and network billing are two

different ways -QUESTION:

11

12

MR. CARPENTER:

The tariff -- the tariff doesn't

even discuss -- what the tariff does --

15
16

And the tariff doesn't require them

to select either one.

13
14

They are

QUESTION:

Well, does that mean the tariff

doesn't require them to select either one?

17

MR. CARPENTER:

The tariff obviously requires us

18

to bill them, and it defines our obligations in billing

19

them.
QUESTION:

20

What if you made a contract to give

21

them one option rather than the other?

22

obey that contract?

23

MR. CARPENTER:

Would you have to

Our position -- it's our

24

position that we have to give them a choice of one of

25

those two.

think
QUESTION:

2

Well, that's not my question.

My

3

question is, you give them a choice and they say, we'll

take network billing, and you say, we will agree to give

it to you --

MR. CARPENTER:
QUESTION:

10

12

-- but we're not putting it -- we're

not modifying any tariff.

9

11

Yes.

Right.

Would you have to honor that

contract?
MR. CARPENTER:

Under that set of facts I would

13

read the obligation to provide multilocation billing or

14

network billing into the tariff, and if we violated the

In this instance --

Well, if you failed to use your best

efforts to provide that billing service as you contracted

22

to do, that would be a violation of the tariff, the best

violation
QUESTION:

2

3

That would state a violation, would

it?

4

MR. CARPENTER:

It would state a violation of

5

the tariff, and then the question, you know, would be

6

under the limitation liability clause, whether it was

7

wilful.

8

This -- it so happens in this case our tariff

9

disclaims any responsibility for the billing obligation

10

that they want to read into the tariff, so it's -- it's

11

answering a hypothetical question.
In this case, our tariff says we won't do what

12

13

they said we should have done.

14

QUESTION:

But in the hypothetical question --

15

MR. CARPENTER:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- I take it you -- under Justice

17

Stevens' hypothetical you would have had the option to

18

file that as a tariff, if you'd made that arrangement?
MR. CARPENTER:

19

Just let me clarify one thing

20

about multilocation billing.

21

any of the details about how we bill service or provision

22

service.

23

what they aren't.

24
25

Our tariff doesn't describe

It defines our obligations in doing it and says

Our obligations aren't to allocate charges among
locations, which is what they wanted us to do.

3

Our -- and we have -- there's not an obligation
that we actually render accurate bills.
Obviously, they only pay us what's due, but if

4

we render an inaccurate bill it doesn't excuse anybody

5

from paying the rates, and it doesn't give anybody a right

6

to damages, and it's our -- we have implemented this

7

obligation by giving customers a choice between two

8

different ways of billing the service, and it's our view

9

that we have to -- we honor the choice.

10

QUESTION:

But in the hypothetical case --

11

MR. CARPENTER:

12

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- suppose that you had agreed to

3

provide the MOL billing.

Would that have been subject to

4

filing as a -- could you have filed that as a tariff if

5

you had chosen to do so?

6

MR. CARPENTER:

We could have certainly put in

7

the tariff that the customer has two billing options,

8

multilocation billing and network billing, and we think

9

actually our tariff should be construed, given that we

20

have these order forms that give people that choice, as

21

imposing that obligation anyway.

22

QUESTION:

But didn't you just say your tariff

23

prevents -- I'm really confused about your billing

24

position, because I thought you had just said that your

25

tariff says you will not allocate.

MR. CARPENTER:

QUESTION:

3

MR. CARPENTER:

That's right.

So -So whatever multilocation

4

billing is or isn't, it is not a case where we are

assuming the obligation to allocate charges among

6

locations.

7

QUESTION:

But yet you did agree -- you had a

8

box to check off, and you agreed to provide this service

9

for which the tariff didn't provide, is that correct?
MR. CARPENTER:

10

I suppose there would be two

11

ways to look at this, and I'm -- the first, which I'm not

12

going to advocate, is that the service wasn't authorized

by the tariff.

4

position.

5

It was therefore invalid.

That's not our

Our position is that it was permitted under the

6

tariff so long as it didn't constitute an allocation of

7

charges that gave them a right not to pay us, or to sue us

8

for damages if we didn't do it accurately, and that's

the tariffed rate.

4

the scope of the regulated common carrier service that we

offer.

The FCC has defined that as outside

That's something that's been deregulated.
So that -- this is a situation where our tariff

6

7

didn't assume the obligation that they're claiming, and in

8

which the FCC's regulations would have prevented us from

9

trying to put the service that they're claiming into the

10

tariff.

11

QUESTION:

12

making a contract to do that?

13

But would it have prevented you from

MR. CARPENTER:

No.

It would not have prevented

14

that, but it would have had to be a separate contract for

15

a separate consideration.

16

It's -- Judge Posner had a wonderful phrase --

17

QUESTION:

And would - - and that would have been

18

enforceable in State court or in Federal court on a

19

diversity -MR. CARPENTER:

20

Yes, that would have been

21

enforceable in State court, because that would have been a

22

contract for an unregulated service declared by the FCC to

services.

25

That would be a like a -- if we had a separate

1

contract, to quote Judge Posner, to sell them ugli fruit

2

at a market price, that's outside the common carrier

3

relationship, just as it would be outside the common

4

carrier relationship if we committed an intentional tort

5

like libel, and the fact that someone happened to be our

6

customer wouldn't immunize us from a libel suit.

7
8

9

QUESTION:

But the same doesn't obtain for

intentional interference with business relationships?
MR. CARPENTER:

It does obtain if the

10

intentional interference doesn't arise out of a

11

relationship with them as our long distance customer, so

12

if we -- they mention something here called slamming,

3

which is when you change a long distance customer from

4

someone else's service to yours without authorization.

5

QUESTION:

Yes.

6

MR. CARPENTER:

That's a classic example of

7

something that is quite independent of the customer-

8

carrier relationship, but that wasn't the basis for this

9

judgment here.

20

QUESTION:

But would slamming be -- would an

21

intentional interference with business relationships

22

manifested by slamming, would that be actionable in the

10
11

All right.

I don't know why

Well, let me respond

to both.
When slamming occurs, generally the carrier

12

13

that's the victim isn't your customer.

14

changes our customers to it when they're not authorized,

15

so that's something that has nothing to do with the fact,

16

whether two carriers happen to be customers of one

17

another.

18

MCI occasionally

It's entirely independent.
It's just fortuitous in this situation that in

19

the two incidents of slamming that occurred, but they

20

weren't the basis for this judgment, that COT happened to

21

also be our customer.

22

Now, with respect to Nader, that was a case,

23

there was no filed tariff claim, and that was a case where

24

the practice of disclosing overbooking or not --

overbooking or not was outside the CAB'S definition of the

They had a regulation that

2

specifically authorized common law actions in the event

3

that there was nondisclosure of overbooking.
So the key thing is what's within the scope of

4
5

the agency's definition and the statute's definition of

6

the regulated service, and if a claim involves the rates

7

or the services to be provided in exchange for the rates,

8

then it's going to be governed exclusively by Federal law

and Federal standards, and State law can't be applied.

on three separate grounds, one of which is the competitive

relationships between the two companies under which the

12

filed, and the second one is that the Savings Clause in

claim and saves our claim for wilful misconduct.

brought.

The competitor claims --

Just on the last point, because I

think it follows from what we've just been discussing with

MR. HALL:

Well, this has been --

3

QUESTION:

So your argument is that -- in fact,

your claim -- your claim, this kind of a claim, when we

read the communications statute, the communications

statute does not mean to preempt this kind of claim.

7

MR. HALL:

That is true, Your Honor.

8

QUESTION:

All right.

Fine.

Either your

argument arises under the tariff, or it doesn't.

MR. HALL:

Yes.

QUESTION:

If it does, Justice Kennedy says go

MR. HALL:

QUESTION:

If it doesn't, I say don't the courts

a close question, in the antitrust area, for example, said

where the claim is, Judge, the communications statute, the

18

regulatory statute isn't meant to preempt this kind of

claim.
Where that's a close question, hasn't this Court

always said go first to the commission and see what they

QUESTION:

2

3

Maybe they didn't, but what's the

judge supposed to do if he wants to follow the law?

4

MR. HALL:

Well, I think the judge felt that the

5

common law claims were well within his cognizance and the

6

wilfulness conduct claim which we say is under the filed

7

tariff itself, it is authorized by 203(a), which as the

8

filing of the tariff becomes the law, 201 -- pardon me,

9

2.3.1, which is the wilful misconduct cause of action, if

10

you will -QUESTION:

11

Now, wait, do you read that as saying

12

any State cause of action for wilful misconduct will lie?

13

I read it as saying that the limitations which the tariff

14

has on liability, those limitations contained in the

15

tariff do not apply in the case of wilful misconduct.

MR. HALL:

MR. HALL:

-- that it must not be rate-affecting

had a collision between wilful misconduct and

misrepresentation of rates.

might perhaps give guidance on these nontariffed items.

That is, why isn't our problem, or is it -- we

was unreasonable under the statute, which you could also

argue, you should have gone to the commission.

MR. HALL:

Well, Your Honor --

2

QUESTION:

Now, on your argument, which is, all

3

that's irrelevant because the statute doesn't mean to

preempt State unfair competition law, you still should

5

have gone to the commission to get some determination

about that.

7

Now, if you ran into a statute of limitations

problem, maybe you file your case in the court and then

9

ask them under primary jurisdiction to hold it while you

10

go to the commission, but that would be your

responsibility.

12

it's a close question, therefore you didn't go to the

went back after the amicus brief and -- these are ER.

These are in the record, but they were not in my

QUESTION:

This is all

But it's a classic case, isn't it, if

10

you're saying this is all too complicated, it's absurd to

11

think that people have to read all this, where you would

12

go to the commission and say, commission, the statute

13

requires reasonable rate services.

14

Their rate and services under a thing like that,

nobody can understand that, and therefore it's totally

unreasonable, and therefore it's outside the statute, and

QUESTION:

Well, then it seems to me your

response to Justice Breyer's question is not adequate,

10

because section 208 seems to say that if you're

complaining about a carrier's violation of the act you can

12

file a complaint with the commission and the commission

will adjudicate it.

of the statute?

MR. HALL:

It says the company's liability is

not limited by the tariff, as I assume the company has to

pay an amount that's not set forth in the tariff in the

saying that it must look to State law and that the

8

customer can go to State law.

QUESTION:

Your intentional tort, misconduct,

interference, now is that brought under the -- is that a

11

violation of the act, or is that a State law claim?

14

MR. HALL:

That is a State law claim, Your

Honor, which was brought under the savings clause and -QUESTION:

Well then, then that you wouldn't --

15

even if we assume that you would have to go to the

commission to get adjudicated a claim that what AT&T did

violation of the act, then presumably that would not apply

and you wouldn't have to go the commission.

20

MR. HALL:

Well, Your Honor, we are saying two

21

things about our intentional claim.

First of all, we're

22

saying intentional claim is separate from the

23

Communications Act.

It's not the kind of a thing, the customer relationship,

that the Communications Act addresses.

This -- the -- I

believe the Court has probably seen in our opening brief

That is not in our case, however.

QUESTION:

2

Just answer my question.

Suppose you

3

claimed that the way they were trying to harm you as a

4

competitor was by charging you more than the tariff

5

allowed, would you have a private cause of action for that

6

either under 2.3.1 or anywhere else?
MR. HALL:

7

I don't think we would win, Your

8

Honor, but we would certainly cite those two cases I just

9

mentioned to you, because they do tend to support our

10
11

position.
QUESTION:

You see, I thought you had conceded

12

that point.

In answer to my question earlier, when we

13

were talking about wilful misconduct, I thought the

14

position you took was that all that wilful misconduct

15

applies to is wilful misconduct with regard to matters

16

other than the tariffed items, but you're now saying that

17

it includes wilful misconduct even regarding the matters

covered in the tariff.

and not the second?

Why -- in other words, my first take

on it would be, of course Congress wanted to displace

State unfair competition law.

At least it's unclear.

7

Now, why is my initial take on that wrong?

8

MR. HALL:

9

Well, if I understood your

correction -- your question correctly, Your Honor, the

10

antitrust claims that we cited did survive the

11

Communications Act and filed rate doctrine objections.

12

These were Communications Act cases in one instance.

13

The other kinds of claims that are -- that

involve us also go under 414.

because they were not within the purview of the

7

In the later case of TWA v. Morales, in that particular

8

case there was an amendment, the Airline Deregulation Act,

9

to the FAA, and under that one the Court found a very

10

strong preemption and strong related-to language.

11

both of those approaches, the State AG's efforts to

12

regulate went out the window, and the Court said in that

13

particular case in citing Nader that the pre-1978 FAA,

14

Nader -- pardon me, the State AG's would have been able to

15

do exactly what they did do, or tried to do, I should have

said.

And also, they added on that the States could

18

have regulated intrastate rates of these carriers, and

even the rates of interstate carriers that were

MR. HALL:

Well, there, Your Honor, I guess our

7

answer to that has been that we can't understand how

attempting to put somebody out of business and wilful

9

misconduct which included a mess of dirty tricks relates

10
11

to the purposes of the Communications Act.
QUESTION:

It depends.

If you try to -- if your

12

claim is that they tried to put you out of business by

13

committing a violation of the Federal Communications Act,

14

then you're simply contradicting the Communications Act if

Nobody can tell a carrier what it puts into the

MR. HALL:

Excuse me, Justice Stevens.

12

QUESTION:

I just want to get two things

13

straight on the record for my own information.

Until

14

Justice Breyer raised this question about primary

15

jurisdiction, had the AT&T ever, or the district court or

16

anybody else suggested that there was a primary

17

jurisdiction issue in the case?

18

MR. HALL:

No.

19

QUESTION:

And the second question I have is,

20

has the FCC -- have they filed an amicus brief at any

21

stage of these proceedings?

22

MR. HALL:

No, Your Honor.

23

QUESTION:

It seems unusual.

24

MR. HALL:

We suggested they do, but they didn't

25

respond.

QUESTION:

1

I see.

And the third -- I guess my

2

third question is, is it your claim that the matters of

3

which you complain are outside the tariff or within the

4

tariff?

5

MR. HALL:

Your Honor, they are -- it's a

6

strange mix, and I will tell you one of the reasons why,

7

is that at the trial the AT&T tariff expert said that

8

provisioning and billing, which are a large part of what

9

we're talking about here, are not in the tariff, and that

10

has not helped us make a -- this fine distinction here.
We have -- in our pretrial order we listed the

11

12

kinds of acts, and that's in the J.A.

We listed the kinds

13

of acts that we're complaining about, many of which would

14

square off against tariff provisions and many of which

15

would not.

16

A suppressed billing would not.

Deliberately

17

trying to keep us from getting any cash would not.

18

Slamming, counsel just agreed, would not.

19

Misappropriation of our customers would not.

20

So we felt that the wilfulness misconduct meant

21

a lot more than going down the line of individual numbers

22

below that to see what the breaches were.

23

wilful misconduct, under State law, which is the usual

24

referral, meant a lot more than that just as intentional

25

interference does.

what we are talking about here, that we are certain does

not affect rates and it's been mentioned before about this

because it does take a lot more expenditure on their part

11

and they're not willing to provide it without more money.

12

How can you say that that doesn't affect rates?

Well, that, Your Honor, leads to

another conundrum within this language we have here.

That was a violation of the tariff.

And you'd have a remedy for that at

the Communications Commission, right?

MR. HALL:

You could, but it's also a part of

wilful misconduct if it's intentional and if it's a part

of all of these other things I've been mentioning.
QUESTION:

10

So any intentional violation of a

tariff you can go under State law.
MR. HALL:

12

Your Honor, I think that any -- you

have to prove wilful misconduct, but it's a separate

matter and it has equal dignity.

is there anything in the tariff

MR. HALL:

Yes.

There are many things that

were -- that are not rate-affecting in a tariff.

The

14

tariff -- they are required to put what is rate-affecting

15

in the tariff, but they go down and file thousands of

tariffs.

17

just as easily as rate-affecting if it serves their

purposes.

They can put nonrate-affecting things in there

some things that are not rate-affecting, that you put

those outside the tariff, it seems to defeat the whole

purpose of what the filed rate doctrine -- which may be

passe, but that's another matter.

5

MR. HALL:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, again I have

6

to - - the real world that has been shown here in the

7

evidence by both sides, I've cited page 35 of their

8

opening brief and 13 and 14 of their closing brief, all

9

the materials that were submitted by the amici, and those

10

of our own, in the actual working world they all accept

11

these as part of -- gap-fillers, as they call them, or

12

details, as it was called by counsel, as part of the

tariff.

14

consistent with the tariff.

15

Those are not antithetical with it.

QUESTION:

They're

No, but Justice Ginsburg was talking

16

about matters set forth in the tariff, not these side

17

agreements.

18

MR. HALL:

Okay.

Yes, Your Honor.

19

QUESTION:

Your position is that even some

20

things set forth in the tariff don't affect the rates, and

21

you can sue for failure to provide those provisions under

22

State law so long as they're not rate-affecting, and I

23

just find that a difficult problem.

24
25

MR. HALL:

Well, Your Honor, AT&T made no effort

at trial to make any such distinctions.

I'll come back to

1

that in just a second, because I also want to say that

2

AT&T at trial made no such arguments as they're making

3

here today that there were preferences, that there were

4

rebates and so forth.

5

There's an absolutely silent record on that.

In

6

the intentional interference claim that we filed, if --

7

the pre-trial order is in the J.A., and in that, Your

8

Honor, you will find that they raise the defense of

9

commercial privilege or comparative privilege alone, no

10

such thing as filed rate doctrine defense.
When they requested instructions for the judge

11

12

to give, they did not ask for any instruction that the

3

filed rate doctrine opposed the intentional interference

claim.

It doesn't.

MR. HALL:

awfully certain that under the intentional interference

good chance there'll be something that comes out of the

Now,

1

as a practical matter,

is there anything

wrong with that, which is what I thought that -- you know,

3

there are quite a few cases that suggest that's the right

route.

MR. HALL:

that if you had been simply a competitor and not a

competitor.
