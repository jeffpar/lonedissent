ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. ENRIQUEZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case involves the interpretation of the

11

RICO statute and the Federal theft, bribery and

12

embezzlement statutes.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

(1:00 p.m.)

Concerning the Federal bribery statute, this

14

case presents the issue of whether

this prosecution in

15

Federal court, of State officials,

is within the scope of

16

the statute, even though it does not -- the conduct

17

complained of does not impinge upon -- upon, affect

19

whatsoever.

Concerning the RICO statute, this case presents

21

the issue of what are the elements

of a RICO conspiracy

and how that should be charged to a jury.

nature of the prosecution in this case, State officials

24

being tried for primarily State law violations in Federal

court, it raises great issues concerning Federalism

Because of the

and

1

the federalization of State crimes.
As to the Federal bribery statute, it is our

2

3

position that the statute itself does not reach as far as

4

a prosecution in this case.

5

which funded the bribery did not involve any State,

6

Federal or local funds; but, more importantly, no Federal

7

funds, no local funds, no State funds, whatsoever, were

8

diverted.

9

Of course, the -- the funds

18 U.S.C., Section 666 contemplates the kind of

10

transaction where, for example, money is embezzled from

11

the government, where there is a theft of government

12

property, or, in the bribery context, where government

13

funds are diverted as a result of the bribe.

14

mean by this, for example, is where money is, for example

15

paid to a government official, and then a -- a bid is

16

awarded or a contract is given or a lease is awarded or a

17

grant is made or a job is given, something of that nature

18

QUESTION:

And what I

Of course, it's clear the statute

19

would apply in those cases.

20

is no Federal interest in how Federal prisoners are

21

treated when they're housed in State facilities?

22

MR. ENRIQUEZ:

But are you suggesting there

Not at all, Your Honor.

I am

23

saying that there - - I do recognize that there is a

24

Federal interest in how the prisoners are treated.

25

and I think that could be vindicated probably in a

And -

properly worded statute that is directed to that.

2

this statute is not directed to that.

3

Additionally,

if I may point out,

But

the

But our -- our inquiry,

really --we

10

think probably that Congress is the one to decide whether

11

the government's interest is satisfied.

12

there's any separate inquiry.

13

this,

14

by an application of the statute,

15

MR. ENRIQUEZ:

So I don't think

If -- if the statute covers

then the government's interests would be satisfied

it would be, Justice

21

It would be, but it's our

That's what this statute is directed

That's the focus of it.

QUESTION:

That is what the government

Then why -- why -- why is this

22

statute -- I gather the government gave 860 -- or

23

$850,000, and about 915,000 a year, to house 100 -- 100

24

Federal prisoners -- up to 100.

Yes, Your Honor.

That's about $9,000 or $10,000 a

MR. ENRIQUEZ:

QUESTION:

5

Yes, Justice Breyer.

To create a certain kind of a room, a

cell.

6

MR. ENRIQUEZ:

7

QUESTION:

Right.

And now that room or cell was

8

misused.

So why doesn't it affect the -- exactly the --

the very, very expenditure that the Federal Government

10

made?

prisoner, $10,000, to create a certain kind of cell that

12

is to be used in a certain kind of way.

13

your client took a bribe to use it in a different way.

14

why does that not directly affect the Federal expenditure

15

that was at issue?

16

We'll give you a thous -- we'll give you this

MR. ENRIQUEZ:

And now, this -So

Well, because in -- in -- in the

17

trial court level, the judge faced the issue of whether

18

this conduct in this case, the -- the conjugal visits or

19

the contact visits, were -- were illegal.

20

was not asked to find whether that was improper conduct in

21

this situation.

22

bribes were paid for contact visits.

23

And the jury

And what they were asked were whether

1

I'm --I'm sorry, I didn't -- I didn't

2

quite grasp the -- the answer to your question.

3

there -- is there a doubt, is it disputed that conjugal

visits are unauthorized for -- for Federal prisoners

Is

Yes -- yes, ma'am.

So why would that have to be put to

That's a given, right?
MR. ENRIQUEZ:

No -- no, ma'am.

The -- the

10

judge, in instructing the jury, said that the question of

11

whether there were conjugal visits or contact visits --

12

and that was disputed in the evidence - - was not the

13

issue.

14

visits, whatever their nature may have been.

15

The question was, was their payment for these

QUESTION:

Well, why would there have been a

16

need for the briber to bribe if the conjugal visits were

17

lawful?

18

MR. ENRIQUEZ:

I -- I think it's because it was

19

a policy of the sheriff's department not to allow conjugal

20

visits.

the visits that occurred were not conjugal -- conjugal

22

visits.

MR. ENRIQUEZ:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. ENRIQUEZ:

Is that covered by this statute?
Yes, it is covered by that

4

statute, because then there is -- is something that was

5

taken from the Federal funds or from the State funds, but

6

not the local funds.

7
8

QUESTION:
These are State.

No - - no; these are State funds.

It just is in the Federal facility.

MR. ENRIQUEZ:

9

I

Yes.

Yes, sir, it -- it is -- Justice

10

Kennedy, it is covered by this statute, because the

11

statute, in my reading of it, says, not only are we

12

protecting Federal funds, but state, we're going to

13

protect your funds, we're going to protect your property,

14

we're going to protect you from bribery.

15

the plain reading of the statute, it does cover that

16

situation.

17

QUESTION:

Suppose the Federal Government gives

18

money for a museum or for a dam, and a State official

19

improperly says to the public, I'll charge you to use the

20

dam, and keeps the money.

21

dam if you bribe me.

MR. ENRIQUEZ:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. ENRIQUEZ:

25

Or, I'll only let you use the

Mmm-hmm.

Is that covered by the statute?
I -- I think it would be probably

not covered by the statute, because nothing was taken from

the Federal Government or the State government or the
local government.

The -- there was no taking of funds

from these entities.

And so I don't think it would be

covered by the statute.

And I don't think this statute is

intended to cover all of those situations.
For example, from the legislative history, it -and from the reading of the statute, it makes it clear
that not all prohibited transactions are covered, even if
the agency receives - QUESTION:

Well, that -- that -- that's a bit

tautological to say that not all prohibited transactions
are covered.
MR. ENRIQUEZ:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Where -- where in the statute do you

find the language that would make it not applicable, say,
to Justice Breyer's question?
MR. ENRIQUEZ:

I find it in -- in the bribery

portion of the statute that says that in order for it to
be a violation, there has to be -- it has to involve a
transaction - - business transaction or series of
transaction of government, involving more than $5,000.
That $5,000 figure is something that is carried through,
throughout the statute, not only in the bribery
provisions, but also in the theft and embezzlement
provisions.

QUESTION:

So you say the amount of the bribe

would have to be $5,000?
MR. ENRIQUEZ:

No, Your Honor, I do not.

Under

the terms of the statute, the amount of the bribe can be
any amount.
QUESTION:

Then what does the $5,000 refer to?

MR. ENRIQUEZ:

It refers to the value to the

Federal Government or the State government or the local
government of what was taken away from them.

Similar to

the embezzlement and theft provisions that say, if -- if
money is taken from the Federal Government, embezzled, and
it's $5,000, then it's a violation under the statute.
QUESTION:

But you don't tie it into the text of

this provision, Mr. Enriquez; that -- that -- that's what
troubles me.

Why not -- I -- I find it difficult to -- to

see that there's any business transaction or series of
transactions involved here.

What -- what is the business?

You -- you -- or you've conceded that point, haven't you
MR. ENRIQUEZ:

MR. ENRIQUEZ:

I -- I think that's -- there's a

possibility of that reading.

But I think when you look,

Justice O'Connor, at the structure of the statute that
talks about the other parts, embezzlement and theft of
property, they're talking about taking it -- taking it
from the government.
QUESTION:

Well, but we're looking at (B),

somebody who corruptly solicits or demands for the demand
of any person -- that could be for the benefit of
Beltran -- or agrees to accept anything of value from any
person -- and he agreed to accept money from Beltran -intending to be influenced or rewarded -- which he was -in connection with a transaction of the government or
agency -- the transaction being the housing of Federal
prisoners, pursuant to the contract.
I mean, I could read it, and it seemed to fit.
Am I missing something?
MR. ENRIQUEZ:

I -- I guess our position,

Justice O'Connor, is that the -- the only transaction
there was a transaction between the marshal's office and
the County of Hidalgo to establish this agreement.

And --

and I don't think that -- unless it be under some kind of
third-party beneficiary theory or some other kind of -- of
theory, that that would bring Beltran -QUESTION:

It isn't that complicated.

And he agreed to take money to allow

MR. ENRIQUEZ:

That's right.

But it -- it

5

didn't have anything to do with, for example, whether he

should be in the jail or not.

7

strictly the marshal's -- the U.S. marshal's decision.

8

He's the one that decides how many people -- Federal

9

prisoners -- are going to be in that jail or whether

10

That was something that was

they're going to be housed in that jail or another jail.
QUESTION:

11

Well, the reason the government wants

12

a statute like this is to avoid the unseemliness of giving

13

large sums of Federal money for services to the Federal

14

Government that are being carried out in a corrupt fashion

15

by the entity and the employees charged with conducting

16

it.

17

MR. ENRIQUEZ:

MR. ENRIQUEZ:

9

If I could, another indication --

10

QUESTION:

I will try.

May I just ask this?

guess I didn't read it the same way Justice O'Connor did.

12

I thought the transaction was the conjugal visit, and that

13

that had a value of over $5,000.

15

QUESTION:

Isn't that what the court below

relied on, the conjugal visit?

MR. ENRIQUEZ:

And -- and --- that's what both courts below

QUESTION:

-- and is it not -- is not correct

21

that the -- the transaction term is broader than business?

22

There's a comma between "business" and "transaction" --so

QUESTION:

And this is surely a nonbusiness

transaction.
MR. ENRIQUEZ:

-- Justice Stevens, yes.

But

4

then you would have a situation where, within the bribery

says that the bribe can be of any value - -

MR. ENRIQUEZ:

No.

That's correct.

What they called a transaction was

allowing the conjugal visit.

23

consider the com -- the companion statute to 666, which is

18 U.S.C., Section 201, which is also a bribery statute,

14

and which, it can be said, was the impetus for the

1

creation of Section 666.
16

And Section 201 is referred to

in the legislative history.
Section 666 was enacted because, in interpreting

17
18

Section 201, many courts had given a narrow definition to

19

agents of government, or who was acting on behalf of the

20

government, to come within the scope of that bribery

statute.

Concerning RICO, it's our position that in order

has to prove that the defendant either committed two

believe this is so, first of all, because it's a natural

reading of the RICO substantive, which states that the

QUESTION:

And -- and --

There are different ideas of how to

MR. WOLFSON:

Yes.

Well, I do want to point out, there is

limitation that is in the statute, which is that the -which is that the -- there are two limitations I do want
to point out.

First of all, the -- the defendant has to

be an agent of a local organization.

And he has to be

able to act on behalf of the organization.

So it may not

be that every single employee of every organization is
covered.

There is a level of, I think, responsibility,

official responsibility, that is covered -- captured in
the term "agent."
And the other point is that the statute
covers -- this is in subsection (B)

-- benefits under a

Federal program that covers a variety of forms of Federal
assistance, and that -- the legislative history and the
courts have - - have - - do point out that there are some
purely commercial transactions between the government and,
say, somebody who the government buys computers from, just
without any kind of Federal programmatic aspect.

I mean, if the government just goes out into the
open market and spends $10,000 for fungible equipment,
that's not necessarily ben -- that's not benefits under a
Federal program or form of Federal assistance.

There is

a -- there is an aspect of the implementation of a Federal
policy that comes with those words.
I want to turn at this point to the - - the other
issue before the Court, which is the RICO conspiracy
issue.

Our posissue -- our position on that issue --

excuse me -- is -- is quite straightforward, which is that
the RICO conspiracy provision follows traditional
principles of conspiracy law.

And under the traditional

principles, the government is not required to prove that
the defendant - - the conspiracy defendant agreed
personally to commit the offense that is the object of the
conspiracy.
The government needs to prove only that the
conspirators agreed among themselves that the offense
would be committed by one or more of them, and that the
defendant associated himself with that -- with that
agreement.

Nothing in the RICO conspiracy statute

suggests that Congress intended to depart from this
well-settled rule.
Congress used, really, a term of art,

"to

conspire," when it used that language in Section 1962(D).

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. ENRIQUEZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
It - - the discussion that General Wolfson
engaged in with this Court concerning RICO conspiracy, the
great debates that went on in Congress concerning the
enaction of this statute, the legislative history, all of
that was directed to RICO substantive.

So it -- it just doesn't

The -- the focus here is, what is the object of

10

the conspiracy?

11

in our view, is not simply to join an enterprise that --

12

that operates in that fashion, but to -- to personally

13

agree to commit two specific acts of racketeering.

14

what the whole discussion in the legislative history was

15

16

17

And the object of the conspiracy, in --

That's

I would suggest to the Court, concerning both of

18

these statutes, Section 666 and -- and the RICO statute,

19

that there are certain areas of government which

historically this Court has indicated to us, under the

21

Constitution, have been deemed within the province, or

22
