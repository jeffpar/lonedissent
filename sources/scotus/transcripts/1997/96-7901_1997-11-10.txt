CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

next in Number 96-7901, Richard F. Trest v. Burl Cain.

5

Ms. Hudsmith.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF REBECCA L. HUDSMITH

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. HUDSMITH:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
A Federal court as a general proposition is not

10
11

and ought not be obligated to raise a nonjurisdictional

12

defense such as procedural default when the party to the

13

proceeding has failed to raise that defense itself.

14

In this case, in the opinion below the United

15

States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit evidences a

16

belief that it must have raised, had to raise, was

17

obligated to raise what it perceived to be a defense of

18

procedural default and deny the merits of the petitioner's

19

claim on that basis.
QUESTION:

20

Ms. Hudsmith, you're not asserting

21

here that the court could not have raised it on its own

22

You're just asserting that it had no obligation to.

23

that the limit of your argument here?
MS. HUDSMITH:

24
25

That is the cert question

presented.

Is

QUESTION:

Right.

2

MS. HUDSMITH:

I actually think we can and ought

3

to go a little further, Your Honor, and I would say,

4

Justice Scalia, that the Federal court --

5

QUESTION:

6

MS. HUDSMITH:

7

QUESTION:

8

MS. HUDSMITH:

9

Well, you presented --- can.

Yes.
It has the power to raise a

waived defense that is nonjurisdictional, but it ought not

10

to without first giving the parties an opportunity to be

11

heard, and it -- and in this context of procedural default

12

it ought to do so only rarely.

13
14

QUESTION:

So what you're asking for us, from us

is a remand --

15

MS. HUDSMITH:

16

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

-- to let the court of appeals

17

decide whether it wants to exercise its discretion to

18

raise this issue or not?

19
20
21
22

MS. HUDSMITH:

That is the most obvious remedy

that we would ask for and hope this Court would grant.
QUESTION:

That's an extremely narrow point,

perhaps narrower than I thought the question presented.

23

You agree that the court of appeals could, under

24

Granberry v. Greer, perhaps, have raised this point but it

25

wasn't obligated to.

You read its opinion to say it

1

thought it was obligated to, so then we would remand it

2

and tell the court of appeals you may do it but it's a

3

matter of discretion.

4

MS. HUDSMITH:

No, Your Honor.

I agree that

5

when a case gets this far and is before this Court and,

6

given the different opinions that are available to be read

7

in the courts of appeals on this issue, that is when the

8

Court should raise procedural defaults sua sponte.

9

I think this Court should give the courts of

10

appeal, then the court of appeal below, more guidance than

11

that, and I'm prepared to offer what guidance I can to the

12

Court in that regard.

13

QUESTION:

I wasn't certain, in reading the

14

Fifth Circuit opinion, that it thought it was obligated to

15

do this.

16

It wasn't all that clear to me.
MS. HUDSMITH:

I will acknowledge, Justice

17

O'Connor, that, unlike the court of appeals' opinion in

18

Granberry, where the court of appeals apparently concluded

19

that it could not ignore a waiver, the Fifth Circuit in

20

the opinion below did not say that.
However, the court must have known, because the

21
22

dissent, in the form of the Hon. Richard Parker, made

23

reference to the fact that the State had never raised the

24

defense of procedural default and ought to be barred as a

25

result.

1

And I would suggest that it is a fair reading of

2

the opinion, despite the lack of information from the

3

court on the significance of that, that its failure, that

4

the panel majority's failure to even discuss that, in

5

effect, if you will, State procedural default, means that

6

it felt obligated, no matter, to do what it did, and that

7

is to decide the claim against the petitioner on the basis

8

of what it perceived to be a procedural default, and the

9

opinion does --

10

QUESTION:

Ms. Hudsmith --

11

MS. HUDSMITH:

12

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

-- did the State in its opposition to

3

the petition for certiorari, did the State contest whether

4

the opinion below, whether the court below felt obligated?

5
6
7

MS. HUDSMITH:

They didn't address the issue,

that I'm aware of, that -QUESTION:

Well, if they didn't address the

8

issue, and if the question presented clearly only asks

9

whether the court of appeals is required to raise the

20

defense sua sponte, how do we get into this other point?

21

I thought the case was taken on the assumption

22

that the court below was -- felt itself obliged to raise

23

the defense sua sponte.

MS. HUDSMITH:

Isn't that what the question

And the State did not object that the

question presented does not --

MS. HUDSMITH:

QUESTION:

Well --

-- conform to the true state of

facts?

6

MS. HUDSMITH:

The State -- and I know they can

7

speak better to this than I, but the State does take the

8

position that the opinion can be read more broadly.

9
10

QUESTION:

13

I asked whether they

did it in opposition to the petition for certiorari.
MS. HUDSMITH:

11
12

Too late now.

I am not aware of that, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

I don't like getting a case here and

14

then finding that it involves a totally different issue

15

from the one that we granted, and that's what you're

16

essentially saying it does.

17

MS. HUDSMITH:

What I'm saying is that the

18

narrow -- there's a very narrow issue presented to this

19

Court in the question presented.

And that's the issue you framed in

MS. HUDSMITH:

And I'm prepared to speak to

that, but I'm also prepared to speak more broadly if the

8

MS. HUDSMITH:

9

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

I would not have voted to take this

10

case if I thought what it was going to come down to is a

11

parsing of the opinion of this court of appeals to decide

12

the cosmic question of whether this one opinion by this

13

court of appeals in fact displays a belief that the court

14

is obliged to sua sponte raise the issue, or does not -- I

mean,

time on.

this is not something that we should be spending our

MS. HUDSMITH:

I agree.

1

reading of the opinion itself.

2

QUESTION:

Does the answer -- does it make any

3

difference, in answering the question that you raise, that

4

here we have some convictions from another State, a State

5

other than Louisiana --

6

MS. HUDSMITH:

7

QUESTION:

8

Well --

-- that are being challenged?

Does

that matter?

9

MS. HUDSMITH:

The way the question's framed, it

10

doesn't matter, but I'm certainly aware of the context in

11

which this case comes to this Court, and it is one in

12

which my client, who is in custody at Angola, at Louisiana

13

State Penitentiary at Angola, and is challenging a

14

Louisiana enhanced sentence, does so, among many reasons,

15

because he believes the underlying Mississippi convictions

16

were constitutionally invalid and should not be used to

17

enhance.

18

And in the State's brief in response -- and I

19

might add that, given we were not given notice and an

20

opportunity to be heard, and only knew of the court's

21

stance on the case with the opinion being issued, the

22

brief was really the first time I had and the first time

23

the State really had to really join issue, if you will, on

24

this very complex topic, I think, but --

25

QUESTION:

Well, our cases previously, cases

1

like Granberry v. Greer and others, have talked about a

2

procedural default in the sense of failing to raise

3

something in Louisiana, where the -- where your client

4

hypothet -- or not hypothetically, actually is held in

5

custody.

6

But what the court of appeals focused on was a

7

failure -- the fact that you could not now go back and

8

raise something in Mississippi.

9

MS. HUDSMITH:

That's correct and, of course, if

10

we had given an opportunity to speak to the issue, the

11

petitioner would have argued that that was no procedural

12

default at all.

13

Getting back really to the question Justice

14

O'Connor posed and you've added to, Mr. Chief Justice, the

15

question becomes, what is the significance of the fact

16

that we're dealing with an underlying Mississippi

17

conviction?

18

In fact, the Louisiana judgment for which the

19

petitioner stands in custody is not based in any way,

20

shape, or form on his having defaulted procedurally by

21

failing to first go to Mississippi and attack those

22

convictions.

23

So in a very real sense, in fact in every sense

24

that I can think of, there is no adequate and independent

25

State law ground from Mississippi supporting this

judgment.

2

QUESTION:

But there might be one from

3

Louisiana.

4

through this,

5

this,

6

to give to a question that had four parts,

7

IFP petition, and there were -- I mean,

8

much I should hold them to what they've written in three

9

pages there.

I mean, as I understood it, when I'd gotten
it's quite -- I don't know where to begin in

and I'm reluctant to hold them to an answer they had

10

and it was an

I don't know how

But the Federal constitutional question, as I'd

11

understood it, would be whether the State of Louisiana can

12

increase an offender's sentence on the basis of

13

convictions in a different State, which convictions either

14

resulted from a guilty plea where he was not told about

15

his right to appeal,

16

was involuntary,

17

estopped from attacking it,

18

Mississippi.

19

isn't it?

or resulted from a guilty plea that

or both,

and they're collaterally
they can't attack it in

That's the Federal constitutional question,

20

MS. HUDSMITH:

21

QUESTION:

I agree with that.

Fine.

If that's the Federal

22

constitutional question,

23

ever,

24

answer it, because it's never been raised.

25

I can't find it raised anywhere,

in the State of Louisiana.

Of course they didn't

The closest you could come is something like the

appeal part of it, where in fact what's cited is a

2

Louisiana case, and then a reference to this case of

3

Griffin, so I would think that that wasn't exhausted.

4

I don't -- I don't -- it's never been raised,

5

and there could well be an independent ground that you

6

can't, you know, go through five proceedings in Louisiana

7

and never raise this issue.

8

9

MS. HUDSMITH:

Well, certainly the State in its

brief in response has -- has for the first time, Justice

10

Breyer,

11

just described it, was not fairly presented to the State

12

courts in the petitioner's --

13

QUESTION:

14
15

I might add, suggested that the claim, as you've

I don't see it presented at all, and

if I'm right about that, what are we supposed to do now?
MS. HUDSMITH:

Well, I would have two responses

16

to that question.

One is, and I think it's the very first

17

and most important one, and it gets back to a point that

18

Justice Scalia made about this Court knowing what it has

19

before it on the table when it decides to exercise its

20

scarce judicial resources and grant a cert petition, that

21

the State at least as late as the opposition to the cert

22

petition, should have raised the issue of exhaustion and

23

did not, and therefore this Court ought to consider that

24

defense waived by the State of Louisiana.

25

my first and foremost posture.

That would be

1

Secondly, I'm not prepared to concede, based

2

upon this record, Your Honor, that in fact the claim was

3

not fairly presented in some form to the State courts in

4

the petition filed in 1990 by the petitioner.

5

QUESTION:

Petitioner himself recognized that

6

the -- that it was obscure -- I forgot what the words

7

were, that --

8

MS. HUDSMITH:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

He did --

Obscurely presented, or inarticulate,

or something.
MS. HUDSMITH:

He said that it was obscurely

12

framed and that the claim, something to the effect was

13

floating in muddy waters, and even the Fifth Circuit

14

acknowledged that he had to elucidate more on the claim

15

and did so in his objections to the magistrate's report

16

which were filed in 1994.

17

But again, it gets back to the point that I made

18

earlier in response to Justice Breyer's point, and that is

19

that the State then certainly, before the district court

20

ruled on the case, could have responded and, I might add,

21

quite simply, particularly with the petitioner making note

22

of the fact that the claim wasn't -- wasn't well-

23

articulated before, they could have filed a one-page

24

statement saying, this claim has not been exhausted in the

25

State courts.

1

QUESTION:

Did I --

2

QUESTION:

They didn't -- I'm sorry.

3

QUESTION:

Did I understand you to say at the

4

outset that this really is very narrow because you're not

5

objecting to the authority of the court of appeals to

6

raise the procedural default sua sponte.

7

you're objecting to is the notion that they must do so.

8

Is that true?

9
10
11

MS. HUDSMITH:

The only thing

The question that I framed is

very narrow, I will admit, but -QUESTION:

So do you -- you're not saying that

12

they couldn't do the same thing here as in Granberry.

13

That is to say, exhaustion and procedural default, they're

14

very much alike, so it's something that the court can

15

bring up on its own.

16

MS. HUDSMITH:

Beyond the answer to the narrow

17

question, what I am saying, and I want to be heard very

18

clearly as saying, just in case it's not clear enough in

19

the brief, that once we go beyond that very narrow

20

question, it is the petitioner's position that to the

21

extent that a Federal court can raise a waived or

22

forfeited nonjurisdictional defense, it should only do so

23

in very rare circumstances, and in the context of a

24

procedural default defense it should do so even in more

25

rare circumstances than those presented in Granberry v.

1

2

Greer.
Because Granberry v. Greer, which is a very

3

instructive case but not controlling, of course, on this

4

issue, concerned the defense of exhaustion, and in very

5

many important respects exhaustion is a different -- it is

6

a different defense, it serves different purposes, and its

7

consequences are much graver.

8

9

And so I want to be clear that -- and I want to
be heard to say that the Fifth Circuit not only was not

10

obligated to raise the procedural default defense that it

11

believed existed, but it ought not to have done so under

12

the circumstances of this case, and I think appropriately

13

the Federal courts in general ought not to raise such a

14

defense except in very rare circumstances where, maybe

15

because of comity, and maybe because of concerns of

16

finality, it is indeed appropriate for a Federal court to

17

save the State from itself.

MS. HUDSMITH:

MS. HUDSMITH:

Absolutely not.

Is right here, yes.
Yes, sir.

and - QUESTION:

Is it clear that Louisiana could not

3

have -- the Louisiana courts could not have examined this

4

question, and the validity of and the existence of the

5

alleged bar in Mississippi?

6

even looked at that, did they?

7

MS. HUDSMITH:

The Louisiana courts never

The Louisiana courts were

8

certainly put on notice with the petition filed by the

9

petitioner in 1990 in the State court that he was

10

attacking the constitutional validity of his Mississippi

11

conviction to be used for the collateral consequence of

12

enhancing his Louisiana conviction, and at -- of enhancing

13

his Louisiana sentence, and undoubtedly at that point a

14

Louisiana court could have and, if it wanted to, was put

15

on notice that it could say no, Mr. Trest, you must first

16

go to Mississippi.

17

But in fact, Louisiana is more generous than

18

Mississippi and more generous in -- than the Federal court

19

in the Custis case in allowing in the first instance in a

20

habitual offender proceeding an attack by the defendant on

21

the voluntary and intelligent nature of the guilty plea

22

that forms a basis for prior conviction and, likewise, in

23

post conviction proceedings.

24
25

And I might add that even a failure on the part
of the petitioner which he must acknowledge to have

1

objected on this basis at the habitual offender proceeding

2

does not prohibit under Louisiana law his raising this

3

issue in post conviction proceedings.

4

So what I'm saying, I hope in answer to your

5

question, Justice Kennedy, is that the Louisiana court was

6

certainly put on notice it could have raised the issue of

7

a "procedural bar."

8

to support this State court judgment such that a

It did not, and there is none, then,

And I would suggest, and this really sort of

10
11

gets back to Justice O'Connor's initial question, that the

12

fact that Mississippi may have some vague, or attenuated,

13

or some interest in its judgment, it is not so great to

14

create a procedural bar.

15

There must first be -- the judgment that we must

16

focus on is the Louisiana judgment, and it's not supported

17

by a Mississippi bar, and so we've got interest in the

18

air, if you will, and that's hardly a basis for a Federal

19

court to refuse to exercise its power.
QUESTION:

20

Well, I would think either from the

21

standpoint of discretion or the mandatory rule when a

22

third State, or a second State's interest is involved

23

here, Mississippi, and they're not before it, but that is

24

a compelling case for not allowing the question to be

25

presented.

QUESTION:

But Ms. Hudsmith, if I understood

I would think that is.

your argument properly, weren't you saying that really

Mississippi has no interest because there's nothing in

this proceeding that's going to set aside the Mississippi

judgment?

even if they're entirely valid.

The only question is whether the Louisiana

MS. HUDSMITH:

Yes, Justice Stevens.

That is a

11

very critical point, and that is that the Mississippi

conviction that was imposed back in 1976 is final, and the

13

petitioner has served his time.

MS. HUDSMITH:

succeeds in his present action, and then he commits

18

another offense in Mississippi, and Mississippi says we're

19

going to commit you on the basis of our habitual offender

20

statute, and your client says no, you can't do that,

21

because in the Federal proceedings in Louisiana it was

held that these -- this conviction was invalid.

of the finality of its judgment.

MS. HUDSMITH:

Do you claim that Mississippi would

MS. HUDSMITH:

My initial reaction is that no,

15

there wouldn't be, that whether it be in the context of a

16

Mississippi attempt to enhance a sentence because of a

17

Mississippi conviction or otherwise, that Mississippi,

18

because it wasn't a party to this action, ought not be

19

precluded from defending its -- both its conviction and

20

asserting its procedural laws that the petitioner failed

21

to comply with vis-a-vis Mississippi.

QUESTION:

the habitual offender proceeding itself, a defendant can

call into question the validity of a guilty plea.

11

So it's happening, and surely we're not going to

12

stop that and not allow -- again, I feel like I'm speaking

13

up for Louisiana here, because Louisiana has its own rules

14

and its own procedures, and they say we can look beyond

15

this judgment if it's presented to us in the right way and

it's compelling.

way it is, and Mississippi could do the same with

2

carelessness, which seems to be what happens here, didn't

4

MS. HUDSMITH:

Your Honor, my response to that

5

would be that first of all the -- Louisiana, like

6

Mississippi, now has a prescriptive period, if you will,

7

that's what we call it in Louisiana, for when a petitioner

8

who is in prison in Louisiana can bring a post conviction

9

proceeding, so the oldness of these claims is,

I think,

10

going to lessen as more and more States like Louisiana and

11

Mississippi adopt these bars, these time bars to these

12

claims.

13

But I think it's even more unseemly for us to

14

allow a Federal court, or to give a Federal court the

15

authority, or even require a Federal court to ignore a

16

State's procedural default because of negligence or

17

inadvertence or whatever, when at the same time this

18

Court's jurisprudence clearly holds that the petitioner's

19

inadvertence or negligence does not save him from his

20

procedural default and, as we know, there are petitioners

21

in those circumstances who have been executed because of

22

that inadvertence or negligence.

23

So yes, it has been a long time, and I think

24

these cases will be less and less so because of these time

it's an appropriate response and more unseemly to allow

proceedings ought to include a caution or instruction, if

10

you will, that the Court ought to give the parties notice

So I assume he'll argue

13

that this third one, he didn't really know that he had a

Federal claim until the Louisiana courts decided Robisher

and he had a chance to digest it, and because Robisher was

the first time that anybody had suggested under Louisiana

law, in reference to Federal law, that there could be some

kind of claim here.

it clear how that argument will come out?

petitioner did after his claim was presumptively ignored

by the trial judge, he went to Federal court and filed the

QUESTION:

The Mississippi proceedings.

Ms. Petersen, I -- correct me if I'm

6

wrong, but I thought the other side in this case said that

7

in an objection to the magistrate's report they did make

8

this claim more explicit, that's the point at which it

9

blossomed, that the district court made no response to

10

that objection to the magistrate's report either by

11

committing it to the magistrate again for further

12

proceedings or by ruling on the merits and, that, in fact,

13

the first time it -- and that the State once again said

nothing about it in the circuit itself, and that the first

15

time it came up on the merits was when the circuit brought

it up.

Is my recollection of what they said correct
and, if so, are they wrong?
MS. PETERSEN:

Justice Souter, that is correct.

The first time that this claim was ever brought to the

attention of any forum in this form was when the

The Fifth

Circuit granted the certificate of probable cause which

the district court had denied, and you would think that if

the petitioner really had a problem that his Boykin claim

was not addressed, and further had a problem that the 7(b)

claim, which is the right to appeal, right to counsel, and

same brief.
The exact same brief has been moving through the

presented to the State court, and the answer is no.

establish that it was exercising its discretion.

QUESTION:

The Fifth Circuit --

Is that your argument here, that it

5

would have been an abuse of discretion to come out the

6

other way?

7

MS. PETERSEN:

I believe that the Fifth Circuit

8

had no fact-finding whatsoever on this claim.

The Fifth

9

Circuit was faced with the objections that Trest had filed

10

in the district court.

They were aware of Custis v.

11

United States, and they appointed Rebecca Hudsmith as

12

counsel and ordered the parties to brief Custis.
The District Attorney, who is representing the

13
14

State of Louisiana, briefed Custis.

15

and secondly they argued whether or not this would be a

16

claim that would be cognizable in habeas.
QUESTION:

the question, required, of course they're not required.

21

Suppose we said -- all right, suppose you answer

All right.

The next step would be we remand,

22

and I take it one possible thing to do would be to explain

when a court has the power, or when it lacks the power

25

by the State to raise the issue, assert a claim of an

-- one step, because there's a large

concern here, I think, with a Court raising a

nonjurisdictional question on its own, and if you think of

22

the two models of procedure, there's the adversary system

23

that we follow, and the inquisitorial one that we don't

follow, and the ordinary rule is that judges are obliged

We don't read the opinion that

QUESTION:

But there I think you're foreclosed

MS. PETERSEN:

Well, Chief Justice, we do agree

that, a remand in light of Granberry v. Greer would -- may

However, it is not necessary on the record as

I think that if you look at the record, both as

QUESTION:

we would have to affirm for you, because we're not sitting

That's not what we do.

the State of Mississippi.

offender in June of 1979.

He had until 1987 to go back to

QUESTION:

12

Ms. Petersen, may I ask a question

13

about your internal procedures not related to the merits

14

of this case?
As you see from the discussion today, some very

15
16

important issues in the case can be precluded by the

17

response to the petition for certiorari, and as I

18

understand what happened here, I wonder if it's the

19

standard procedure in Louisiana that it is the local

20

prosecutor who responds to the petition for certiorari,

21

and that the Attorney General's Office does not get into

22

the matter until the petition is granted, is that the

23

case?

24

MS. PETERSEN:

That is correct.

of interest as well, but in this case it was a request by

4

The Attorney General is

That was after the writ was granted, and when we

6

prepared the brief on the merits we were looking forward

7

to the issue of whether Granberry v. Greer should be

8

extended to encompass procedural default.

9

Quite honestly, I think that the parties here

10

agree that the Fifth Circuit was not required, and

11

therefore there is no dispute on that.

12

QUESTION:

I will have to say that I think

13

there's merit to the petitioner's argument that you should

14

read, the Fifth Circuit's opinion that way.

15

After the passage Justice Stevens quoted the

16

Fifth Circuit says, again, the Supreme Court has explained

17

that procedural default will block all Federal review

18

unless there's cause and prejudice.

19

MS. PETERSEN:

20

QUESTION:

And Justice Kennedy --

That's a pretty straightforward

21

statement from the Fifth Circuit.

22

MS. PETERSEN:

It is, Justice Kennedy, and we

23

read that to believe that they've looked at the record for

24

cause and prejudice, that they felt that the record did

25

not establish it, and therefore denied relief.

That is

1

the only way you can read that correctly, is that they

2

looked at the record, they felt that the petitioner could

3

have shown cause -- If you look at the objections to the

4

magistrate's report -QUESTION:

5

But if there was no objection by the

6

State, if this wasn't in the case until the Fifth Circuit

7

put it there, then how could you expect the petitioner to

8

come up with cause and prejudice?

9

a defense that wasn't there and answer it, that's very

He was -- to anticipate

10

strange, so it does suggest that at least he should have

11

had an opportunity to address the cause and prejudice

12

issue.

13

MS. PETERSEN:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, we

14

believe that's the next question, and we do not -- in our

15

brief we do not state that it was one that was fairly

16

encompassed in the question presented.

17

However, I would answer that by saying that the

18

petitioner did have an opportunity when he filed the

19

objections to the magistrate's report, because if you look

20

at his answer, you see that he is admitting new evidence,

21

a transcript, in 1994 from a 1979 conviction which was

22

transcribed in June of 19 -- excuse me, June of 1976.

There's no objection that

The State then argues that despite that they

have, the power to bring it up, and this was not an abuse

But one thing that is clear is that it is an

17

abuse of discretion to assert an independent State ground

18

to bar a petitioner's claim when you assert the wrong

19

independent State ground, an independent State ground that

20

has nothing to do with this case, or at least very little,

21

since it had to do with Mississippi and we're interested

22

in Louisiana.

At least that's an abuse of discretion.

Now, there are many other issues that have been

raised in this very interesting set of briefs, et cetera,

3

All right.

Is there any answer to that, as a

minimal approach?
MS. PETERSEN:

Yes, Justice Breyer.

You would

4

have to find that the Fifth Circuit abused its discretion

5

by invoking Mississippi law.

6

QUESTION:

Well, the reason is because of

7

course, as you've heard, to focus you right on it, that

8

the question is whether the Constitution bars Louisiana

9

from taking this Mississippi conviction into account when

10

it increases a punishment, a matter that perhaps has never

11

even been argued.

12

Now, go ahead.

13

MS. PETERSEN:

Well, I think you can justify it

14

in that the State of Mississippi was never given any

15

opportunity to pass on these convictions despite the fact

16

that Trest was on notice in June of 1979 in Louisiana that

17

they were being used for enhancement, and he had in the

18

State of Mississippi till 1987.

19

So therefore you have the State of Mississippi

20

affording this petitioner an opportunity, clearly knowing

21

the State of Louisiana is using these five other prior

22

felonies, and not going to the State of Mississippi.

23

Meanwhile, you have the interest of the State of

24

Louisiana in presuming that that judgments -- those

25

judgments are valid, and furthermore, he had two options.
