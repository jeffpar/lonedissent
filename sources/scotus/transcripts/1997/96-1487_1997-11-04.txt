Mr. Gornstein.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GORNSTEIN:

8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Respondent was about to board a flight to Syria

10
11

when a Customs inspector informed him that he was required

12

to file a currency report if he was taking more than

13

$10,000 with him.

14

less than $10,000 and he therefore did not file a currency

15

report.

16

Respondent claimed that he was taking

Customs inspectors searched respondent and his

17

possessions and found more than $350,000 in cash.

18

Respondent subsequently pleaded guilty to wilfully failing

1

to file a currency report as he was about to transport

20

more than $350,000 outside this country.

21

offense, Congress has mandated forfeiture of the

22

unreported currency.

23

Circuit held, however, that the forfeiture of any of that

24

currency would constitute an excessive fine.

25

For that

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth

We believe the court of appeals erred for two

First, the unreported currency is an

1

reasons.

2

instrumentality of a reporting offense and may be

3

forfeited as such without violating the Excessive Fines

4

Clause, and second, even if it is not an instrumentality,

5

its forfeiture is a permissible punishment for what is a

6

serious criminal offense.

7

QUESTION:

On your first argument, if it's an

8

instrumentality of the crime and we agree with you on

9

that, does that mean the excessive fines analysis is just

10

inapplicable, or that it is presumptively non -- not

11

excessive?

12

MR. GORNSTEIN:

It is satisfied.

That is that

13

it is not -- it is a way of showing that the fine is

14

nonexcessive because the forfeiture of property that is

15

involved in the offense is an inherently proportional --

16

proportionate sanction.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

In other words, the Excessive Fines

Clause analysis applies in either event.
MR. GORNSTEIN:

It does, but the manner of

20

satisfying the Excessive Fines Clause is by showing that

21

it is property that's seized -- one way of satisfying it,

22

it is showing that the property that is seized is in fact

23

an instrumentality of the offense, and there -- questions

24

may arise about whether it has a sufficiently close

25

connection to the offense to be classified properly as an

1

instrumentality, but once it is, then that would satisfy

2

the Excessive Fines Clause.
QUESTION:

3

Well, if we have to ask about

4

excessiveness anyway, I'm just wondering why we have to go

5

through the additional step of elaborating a big

6

jurisprudence on what is an instrumentality and what

7

isn't.

8

MR. GORNSTEIN:

9

QUESTION:

10

If in any event we're going to talk

about proportionality, maybe --

11

MR. GORNSTEIN:

12

QUESTION:

13

Well, historic --

No.

I --

-- we should just save ourselves a

step.
MR. GORNSTEIN:

14

Well, there are just two

15

different ways of talking about proportionality, Justice

16

Kennedy.

17

once it's an instrumentality.

18

culpability or to the value of the property is ever

19

necessary once there is a showing that this is in fact an

20

instrumentality of the --

21

22

Proportionality, it is inherently proportionate

QUESTION:

No further inquiry into

Well, you said it's presumptively

proportional.

23

MR. GORNSTEIN:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. GORNSTEIN:

No.

I'm saying that it is --

I thought.
I'm sorry if I -- if we had a

1

misunderstanding on that, but generally speaking, if

2

the -- if it is an instrumentality, then it is per se

3

nonexcessive, and I would except from that one small

4

category of cases where perhaps the property is involved

5

in what might be a minor infraction such as a parking

6

violation, but if it is the kind of violations that

7

property have historically been forfeited for customs

8

violations, for criminal offenses, then if it is an

9

instrumentality in the offense, then it is per se a

10

proportionate fine and not an excessive one.
QUESTION:

11

It seems a little odd, though, to

12

equate excessiveness with just instrumentality as opposed

13

to some examination of gross proportionality, or lack

14

thereof.

15

MR. GORNSTEIN:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

Well, I think --

I mean, the mere term excessiveness

seems to import some notion of proportionality to me.
MR. GORNSTEIN:

Well, I think the question is

19

excessive in relation to what.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. GORNSTEIN:

22

23

Yes.
That's right, and here I think

that when some -QUESTION:

Maybe in relation to the criminal

24

fine that could be imposed, or something like that.

25

might be easy to look at.

That

MR. GORNSTEIN:

1

But I think that historically it

2

was that if as long as it was in relationship to the

3

offense, that the property was used in the offense, the

4

seizure was not an excessive fine, because it has always

5

been the case that this has been viewed as a reasonable

6

way, seizure of property involved in the offense, a

7

reasonable and effective way to encourage the owners of

8

property to make sure that their property does not become

9

involved in the offense.

10

sense.

11

because it has always --

It is perfectly commensurate with that goal,

QUESTION:

12

13

It is not excessive in that

Well, I guess this Court has never

really articulated the test.

14

MR. GORNSTEIN:

It has not, and the two cases

15

that this Court has had previously on the Excessive Fines

16

Clause simply said that forfeiture was a fine, but in

17

neither case did the Court set out the methodology for

18

deciding whether the fine would be excessive.

19

Now, our view is that there are really two ways

20

to do it.

21

not excessive, without more.

22

instrumentality, then you would engage in the sort of

23

inquiry that you would generally engage in if you had a

24

monetary fine.

25

First, if it's an instrumentality then it's

QUESTION:

But second, if it isn't an

Well, what is the conclusion that you

1

seek to help us to by saying that it's an instrumentality?

2

We have a purpose for these classifications.

3

that we're asking about an instrumentality, in order to

4

show the close connection of the property to the crime

5

itself?

6

Why is it

I mean, is that the object of the inquiry?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

Yes.

The instrumentality is

7

really just a shorthand expression for the kind of

8

property that has historically been subject to forfeiture
in rem because of the significant involvement of the

10

property in the offense.

11

QUESTION:

Ah, but --

12

QUESTION:

This is not an in rem forfeiture

13

here, is it?

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. GORNSTEIN:

This is not in rem.
It's not an in rem forfeiture,

16

but the criminal provision here in addressing the kind of

17

property that is subject to forfeiture singled out only

18

property that is involved in the offense.

1

QUESTION:

20

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Right.
And that is the shorthand

21

expression for the kind of property that has historically

22

been subject to in rem forfeiture, and we think by using

23

that language Congress manifested its intent to further

24

the general remedial goals that have always been

25

associated with in rem forfeitures.

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Gornstein, in that connection I'm

2

a little confused.

What is the difference between

3

criminal forfeiture and the civil in rem, because I had

4

been I guess under the false impression that for civil

5

forfeiture it could be an excessive fine to take the whole

6

thing.

I thought that was what Austin implied.
MR. GORNSTEIN:

7

I think that the only thing that

8

Austin held was that it was a fine, and then it did not

9

decide how you would decide whether a fine was or was not

10
11

excessive.
Now, the property that was seized in Austin

12

itself may have been so incidentally involved in the

13

offense that it couldn't properly be characterized as an

14

instrumentality of the offense, and if not, it could not

15

be forfeited on an instrumentality theory.

16

QUESTION:

Can you explain the difference -- is

17

there any significant difference between the in personam

18

criminal and the in rem civil for this purpose of judging

19

the proportionality or the -- how much can be forfeited

20

without being too much?

21

MR. GORNSTEIN:

For purposes of our first

22

argument, that is, whether it is an instrumentality, there

23

is no difference.

24

QUESTION:

No difference.

25

MR. GORNSTEIN:

But for the purpose of our
9

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

1

second argument, if you disagree with us on the first one,

2

there is a difference, because the criminal forfeiture

3

embodies the additional purpose of punishing the criminal

4

defendant, whereas, to the extent that punishment is

5

involved in civil in rem, it is punishment only of the

6

owner.
Now, here the criminal defendant can be both the

7
8

criminal defendant and the owner, and he can be punished

9

in both ways in a criminal proceeding, but in a civil in

10

rem proceeding the only person that is being punished, if

11

anyone is being punished, is the owner of the property.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Gorn --

13

QUESTION:

But as far as your instrumentality,

14

it's identical.
MR. GORNSTEIN:

15
16

It would be the same exact

analysis.
QUESTION:

17

Mr. Gornstein, do the old cases on

18

forfeiture of undutied cargos refer to the forfeited goods

19

as being instrumentalities, or have we simply applied that

20

term as a term of art?

21

MR. GORNSTEIN:

22

QUESTION:

23

develop?

The latter.

The latter, okay.

When did that

I mean, it's an odd usage, and I just like to --

24

MR. GORNSTEIN:

25

QUESTION:

Yeah.

-- understand why we use those.

1

MR. GORNSTEIN:

And I wish I had a full

2

explanation for this, but I would say one of the sources

3

of it was Justice Scalia's concurring opinion in Austin,

4

and I think a lot of the courts which use the phrase

5

instrumentality to describe --

6

QUESTION:

Quite recent law?

7

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Quite recent, yeah, that used

8

the phrase instrumentality to describe the kind of

9

property that has a sufficiently close connection to the

10

offense and that could historically be subject to

11

forfeiture.

12

QUESTION:

Your -- I'm sorry.

13

MR. GORNSTEIN:

And a lot of the court of

14

appeals that have struggled with this question since then

15

have picked up on that phrase, and it's --

16

QUESTION:

Going back to Justice Kennedy's

17

question, we could simply stop using the word

18

instrumentality here and consider the argument that the

19

analogy is so close between the undisclosed currency here

20

and the undutied property in the old in rem cases, that

21

that would the basis for your --

22

MR. GORNSTEIN:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

You absolutely could.

-- without getting into this

metaphysics.
MR. GORNSTEIN:

You do not have to get into an

1

elaborate discussion of what is and is not an

2

instrumentality in this case.

3

based on its relationship to the early customs cases, and

4

in the early customs cases, property was brought into the

5

country without declaration it was subject to forfeiture.
QUESTION:

6

You can decide this case

That isn't quite -- I mean, the

7

underlying issue, I think, which is possibly a point of

8

agreement or disagreement with Judge Wallace, is that your

9

view is, if something is an instrumentality, no matter how

10

valuable, it is forfeitable if it's involved in a crime,

11

no matter how trivial, with the exception of parking

12

offenses.

13

All right.
So that means that the Constitution would

14

permit, in your view, the Taj Mahal, for example, to be

15

forfeited if it was once used to sell a teaspoonful of

16

marijuana or something like that.

17

MR. GORNSTEIN:

I think not, because again

18

that's a -- that historically has not been a way in which

19

forfeiture law has been used.

20

QUESTION:

Ah.

Well, now wait, then.

That's

21

interesting, because that's what I was trying to drive at.

22

I thought your initial view was what I said, and

23

now you have a limitation on that initial view, and you

24

say it only applies where?

25

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Well, I think in your example
12

SUITE 400

1

that -- the question would be whether that was an

2

instrumentality of the offense.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Oh, no, no, I'm assuming it was.
No, but what I'm saying is,

5

that's the inquiry, and what I would say is in that case

6

the relationship of the property to the offense is so

7

minor and incidental that it was never -QUESTION:

8

9

Let me make an example with the

hypothetical where it is not minor and incidental.

People

10

are called to the Taj Mahal deliberately in order to sell

11

them the teaspoon of marijuana.

12

that, and I'm trying to get at the underlying point.

13

You know, it's easy to do

Is the underlying point correct, without

14

limitation, no matter how valuable the property, it is

15

forfeitable if used to commit a crime, no matter how

16

trivial, and my difficulty, of course, if it's without

17

limitation, is how one would reconcile that with the

18

excessive -- what seems to be a prohibition of excessive

19

fine.

20
21
22

23
24
25

MR. GORNSTEIN:

And I think that the -- you

start with the history of the early customs statutes.
QUESTION:

Do I have it right, what your

position is?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

Well, I -- with the provisos

that I said, that there are two inquiries that have to be
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

made.

The first is that it is sufficiently involved in

2

the offense to be treated as an instrumentality, and if

3

you're running a business out of the Taj Mahal, yes, that

4

certainly could be forfeited.
If there's one transaction that takes place

5
6

there, even on a single day, maybe or maybe not, but at

7

some point yes, if you're running a business out of the

8

Taj Mahal and selling drugs out of there, that would be an
instrumentality and could be forfeited as such.

10

Now, the reason that -- there are two powerful

11

reasons, it seems to us, why instrumentality forfeitures

12

satisfy the Excessive Fines Clause, and the first is

13

history.

14

require forfeiture of goods brought into this country

15

without declaration regardless of how valuable those goods

16

were.

It could have been priceless jewelry or ordinary

17

gems.

If those goods were brought into the country

18

without declaration, they were subject to forfeiture as

1

such.

20

If you look at the early forfeiture laws, they

This is the very same First Congress that

21

proposed the Excessive Fines Clause, so I think we have to

22

start with the understanding that that Congress did not

23

view that kind of forfeiture as excessive.

24
25

We know from Austin that the Congress viewed it
as a fine, so the only thing that we can understand from
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)28 -2260
(800) FOR DEPO

1

that Congress' action is that they must have thought that

2

that kind of forfeiture was not excessive because of the

3

relationship of the property in the offense.

4

QUESTION:

The argument made against that is

5

that in the case of goods brought into the country

6

illegally in that manner it's not only an instrumentality

7

of a crime, the goods themselves are contraband.

8

MR. GORNSTEIN:

9

QUESTION:

Well --

They have no business being in the

10

country.

They are unlawfully here.

11

those cases on that basis, couldn't you?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

12

You could distinguish

Justice Scalia, I don't think

13

that is a fair characterization, because contraband as we

14

understand it is something that is unlawful to possess.

15

The goods that were being brought into the country to sell

16

were perfectly legal to sell as long as the appropriate

17

duties were paid on them, and the fact that the --

18
19
20

QUESTION:

Yes, but it's as long as, but if it's

not - MR. GORNSTEIN:

Here it's perfectly legal to

21

take money out of the country and transport it out of the

22

country, but only as long as you make the report, and so

23

it has the exact same relationship to the offense as the

24

traditional -- the goods in a customs offense.

25

QUESTION:

Well, why don't you use the term

contraband, rather than instrumentality, then.
MR. GORNSTEIN:

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Justice Stevens, I would be

You'll take an opinion written that

way.
MR. GORNSTEIN:

9

If you want to use the word

10

contraband to describe this kind of property, that is fine

11

with us.
QUESTION:

12

13

No, but I'm just wondering why you

didn't argue it in those terms.
MR. GORNSTEIN:

14

The reason that we did not argue

15

it in those terms is that we understood the term

16

contraband to mean property that is unlawful to possess,

17

like --

18

QUESTION:

Like drugs, or --

19

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Like drugs, that's right, that

20

are -- that sort of uniformly, with rare exceptions,

21

unlawful to possess, not property that is legitimate to

22

possess, but is used in the commission of the offense.

23

Now, I say -- having said that, this is a

24

peculiar kind of property instrumentality that looks like

25

contraband and could be called the corpus of the offense,

1

and if you want to decide the case on that basis by saying

2

you can always forfeit the corpus of the offense because

3

that --

4

QUESTION:

5

(Laughter.)

6

QUESTION:

I don't think we need another phrase.

But Mr. Gornstein, maybe we need two,

7

because I take it on your theory nothing rides on whether

8

these are ill-gotten gains, that is, not possessed

9

lawfully, and are going to be devoted to an unlawful

10

purpose, money laundering, and whether, as at least we

11

must take this case, the possessor had a lawful right to

12

possess and was going to use the money toward lawful ends.

13

So do I understand your position right that, for

14

purposes of the amount of the forfeiture and the excessive

15

fines, it doesn't make any difference whether the funds

16

were possessed totally lawfully or they were, indeed, ill-

17

gotten gains?

18

MR. GORNSTEIN:

That's correct.

As long as they

19

were used in the commission of this offense, they are

20

subject to forfeiture, and it is not excessive, in the

21

same way that property imported into this country that is

22

lawfully possessed and intended for a lawful purpose, to

23

sell it, is also subject to forfeiture.

matter that it's -- that the money is possessed legally,

2

the crime is the failure to report.

3

The hypothetical that I think was given in one

4

of the briefs is, suppose Congress decided to say that

5

failure to report income, that the consequence of that

6

will not be just the ordinary fines that they're -- that

7

are now in place, but that for failure to report you

8

forfeit whatever amount you fail to report.

9

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Yes.

We view that question as

10

not being one of -- we view the earned income as not being

11

an instrumentality of that offense.

12

historical tradition of treating earned income as an

13

instrumentality of a failure to file an income tax return,

14

and the relationship is different.

15

QUESTION:

There has been no

Yes, but what's the historical

precedent for treating undisclosed money in the same way

17

that you're --

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Well, it is the very property

that moves across the border without proper declaration.
QUESTION:

Yes, but your criterion in response

21

to Justice Ginsburg was historical tradition, and there's

22

no historical tradition drawing the analogy that you want

us to draw.

1

the offense in that case is different, because earning

2

income is a condition of having a duty to report, but the

3

money is not physically used in the commission of the

4

offense as it is here.
QUESTION:

5

But the Government's interest is even

6

stronger, because the Government's interest is not only an

7

interest in having reports, it's an interest in collecting

8

the taxes.

9

MR. GORNSTEIN:

And that's right, and that's why

10

it may or may not be an excessive fine based on the value

11

of the fine as against the gravity of the offense.

12

would turn to that analysis.

13

there's -- a property is not an instrumentality it can't

14

be forfeited.

15

QUESTION:

You

We're not saying that if

No, but if instrumentality is to be

16

determined on the basis of some kind of sufficient

17

relationship to the crime, then I would suppose there was

18

a pretty good argument for treating the undisclosed income

19

as an instrumentality.

20

You can't commit the crime unless you have the

21

income, and therefore it's hard for me to understand why,

22

if you're going to treat the undisclosed exported money as

23

an instrumentality without the benefit of a historical

24

example, and you're going to treat -- and you're going to

define instrumentality as this close relationship, it's

I don't think that that makes a

difference, and part -- and one of -- to go back to a

3

question about, that this does not apply even when it is

4

legitimate, found to be legitimate and intended for a

5

lawful purpose, the reason that Congress imposed very

6

serious penalties despite that is that there are many,

7

many cases in which it is impossible for the Government to

8

know at the moment of seizure whether or not property is
intended for particular unlawful purposes like tax

10

evasion, for like, money laundering, like large-scale

11

drug-dealing.
And if it were the case that persons bent on

12

13

those purposes knew that unless the Government knew at the

14

moment of seizure that they were planning to export that

15

money for those purposes, they would -- that the money

16

would be free and clear, they would have far less

incentive to comply with the reporting requirements in the

two areas the kind of approach that it uses when -- to

2

measure excessiveness in both the area of punitive damages

3

and the area of cruel and unusual punishment, and the

guiding factors, it seems to us, can be drawn from those

5

opinions, but first of all you would have to say that the

offense has to be, in terms of value -- I'm sorry, the

7

penalty in terms of value has to be grossly

8

disproportionate to the gravity of the offense.
Second, you would always have to give

that this Court has always used as the best indicator of

2

how seriously Congress regards an offense, and that's the

3

maximum period of incarceration, which here is 5 years'

4

imprisonment without any aggravating factors at all, and

5

it's 10 years' imprisonment if the money is involved in

regarded this as a very serious offense, and when you --

proportional, isn't it?

What is the minimum, 10,000?

that where it starts?

11

MR. GORNSTEIN:

12

QUESTION:

It does.

So if you take out just 10,000,

13

that's surely less of an offense than taking out 300,000,

14

and if you take out only 10, it's a relatively small

offense, you forfeit only 10.

you forfeit 300,000.

If you take out 300,000,

QUESTION:

I am concerned about this, though.

You're appealing in your argument on instrumentality to a

we had convicted this defendant and then filed an in rem

May I ask, does culpability have

went on, then, to address the particulars of this case on

2

the theory that we've lost our first argument that you

3

don't look at those things.
QUESTION:

4

On proportionality, just to follow up

5

on this very question, the kinds of things that I used to

6

look at on the Sentencing Commission and so forth, first

7

you would look at the conduct, and for the worst conduct

8

you'd get a higher sentence, and the second thing that

9

you'd look at would be the harm done, and the more the

10

harm done, the higher the sentence.
So $10,000 to 350,000 is proportionate if, and

11
12

only if, the $350,000 means more harm than the 10,000, and

13

the argument that it doesn't is, it doesn't here because

14

what Congress is trying to stop is money laundering,

15

drugs, a whole host of unlawful things, and here the judge

16

agrees it's nothing to do with it.

17

MR. GORNSTEIN:

18

QUESTION:

But --

So there was no -- what his argument

19

is that there's no harm in this case that's proportionate,

and the culpability, of course, is the same whether you're

taking the 10 or the 350.
Now, that, I think, is the argument this is

disproportionate, so I'd like you to address it.

QUESTION:

6

I think that what --

Why, if it's just going to somebody

in Armenia who happened to lend him some money?

MR. GORNSTEIN:

What I'm saying is that at

the moment of seizure Congress has said we realize that

you're not going to know for sure where this money is

We're going to treat it all as if it's

12

And then the only place where Congress said,

13

okay, if it's shown to involve in other offenses we're

14

going to take account of that, is by increasing the

maximum authorized sentence from 5 years to 10 years, so

Mr. Chief Justice, is that my client, Mr. Bajakajian, is

MR. BLATT:

1

I acknowledge that, Your Honor, that

contraband and proceeds of contraband are forfeitable, but

3

this is an instrument, allegedly an instrumentality of a

Do you think failure to register a

firearm is any different from failure to notify the

Government that you're carrying currency?
MR. BLATT:

Under the statute it is, Your Honor,

because the statute indicates that it's not contraband to

Okay, but if it is contraband, you

1

What if, under Justice Scalia's

This was an unusual case.

It is never easy at

12

the district level to prove that in reference to a

13

forfeiture that it's lawful money for a lawful purpose,

14

and the way we did that, we showed the cultural aspects,

15

the man's intent, and the district court made a factual

determination in reference to this, that this was lawful

money, and he made a factual determination as to reasons

that he lied.

that determination, or did he decide he -- it had not been

QUESTION:

11

Can you go back for a second, because

12

I'm now concerned -- Mr. Gornstein answered me and Justice

Scalia picked up a point that I'd not focused on, which is

14

that this is a mandatory forfeiture statute.

16

It says the

Now, I can understand a statute that says the

convicted person in a case of robbery must pay a penalty

18

up to $5 million as well as prison, and then a person take

$1, and the judge imposes $5 million, and you say, well,

that's way disproportionate, but the statute said may, and

not looking to those factors.

Now, is there -- does that trigger anything in

your mind, any instance where despite this kind of

mandatory statutory provision the courts nonetheless

looked into the way in which the provision applied to a

the way it applies here?

9

MR. BLATT:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. BLATT:

Does that trigger anything?

Yes, it does, Justice Breyer.
What is that?
Because under Austin and Alexander

12

this Court indicated that the Eighth Amendment in

reference to excessive fine does apply.

On the remand of Alexander --

QUESTION:

2

MR. BLATT:

It was.

They had to impose, so --

One of the problems in the

3

Government's position is that they indicate that the

Eighth Amendment does apply.

5

that the particular liquidated damage forfeiture can never

be grossly disproportionate.

It doesn't matter whether

7

it's $10,001, or $3 million.

It's always going to be the

same, no matter in reference to culpability and value.

QUESTION:

MR. BLATT:

You forfeit the moonstone --

assuming you buy the moonstone legally, Your Honor, and

17

you fail to report it and then fail to pay the duty,

18

pursuant to the statute, once you fail to pay the duty it

becomes contraband, and that property becomes tainted.

20

We don't have that situation here.

QUESTION:

All right, but so long as you make

that limitation upon

your argument, there's nothing wrong

about forfeiting something that's worth an enormous value

An instrumentality is a means by which.

We have property divided in three areas,

have always been a strong remedial interest, and have been

When

we're talking about an instrumentality, should it really

I believe there should be some type of cutoff

MR. BLATT:

Judge Wallace has gave a concurring

opinion where he disagreed with the Ninth Circuit

And didn't he say that the 15,000 he

was letting stand because you hadn't challenged it?
MR. BLATT:

3

That was the district court, Your

4

Honor.

5

opinion that he was allowing the 15,000 because he did not

6

feel it was abuse of discretion, and he agreed with the

7

proportionality analysis.
What I am saying, Your Honor, is that the

The -- Judge Wallace indicated in his concurring

district court applied the correct standard of grossly

disproportionate.

11

indicated just now and came up with a decision that the

12

$5,000 fine -- it was a $5,000 fine under the guidelines,

13

not $250,000, and probation, that based upon that he was

14

going to add an additional $15,000 for what he considered

15

what a small fine would be under the guidelines, and the

What's your proportionality analysis there?

Do

5

you assume he's guilty of something really bad because he

6

won't talk about it, or he's perfectly innocent?

7

MR. BLATT:

I don't really assume either, but he

8

has not met his burden, Your Honor.

The defendant, by his

9

failure to report, should have the burden, as it was in

10

this particular case.

11

money was lawful and for a lawful purpose, and that it

12

would be not grossly disproportionate.

13

should have the burden in these matters when he commits a

14

crime and then tries to obtain the moneys in reference to

the forfeiture.

I'm trying to understand your

application of gross disproportionality here.

19

one of the things, one of the principal things that we do

20

is to compare sentences and individuals.

that here, I guess, because we don't have a long string of

22

forfeitures to compare it to.

disproportionality criterion, and you then point out the

1

you really saying that any judge who makes a gross

2

disproportionality analysis and refers to all of the

relevant factors as you have listed them, should be upheld

4

unless we can say that his determination as such was

5

simply unreasonable or irrational?

disproportionality here means?

7

Is that what gross

In other words, it's a standard that goes to the

8

care of the judge or relevant considerations, as opposed

9

to a standard that goes to real comparisons between this

10

instance, that instance, and the other instance.
MR. BLATT:

11

Yes, that's what I'm saying, Your

12

Honor,

13

comparisons, when you evaluate a forfeiture, it's a matter

14

of comparing the value in reference to what is going to be

15

forfeited to the serious nature or extensive nature of the

16

crime.

17

because if we're going to look at real

Well, then we could have -- you know,

we have 700 district judges in the country, and we could

have 700 different results, all of them correct under that

standard, I suppose.

Well, of course, you've got not only

a prohibition against excessive fines, but a prohibition

against cruel and unusual punishment.

imported into the sentencing phase of criminal cases and

12

say, you know, whatever Congress says each district judge

13

has just got to figure out what the right punishment is to

make, sure it isn't cruel and unusual?

15

MR. BLATT:

Could this be

Well, excessive fines have been

16

distinguished significantly from cruel and unusual

punishment, Your Honor, and the -- frankly, I feel that

the district court can make that decision.

going to be differences, but that district court has all

20

of those particular facts in that particular case, and

21

they would be best able to make that determination as to

whether a fine is excessive.

1

possessed funds, so you're not defending that position,

2

then.

2

MR. BLATT:

No, I'm not, Your Honor, and our

4

position at the district court level was, we conceded that

5

the funds were subject to forfeiture, but requested a

6

proportionality examination.

7

significantly in the interim, where 69,000 and El Dorado

8

came out by the Ninth Circuit, where they held the

9

instrumentality test, and that test was used in reference

10

11

The law was changed

to our briefs.
I think a instrumentality, substantial

12

connection, or some form of cutoff or threshold is

13

necessary, but once that threshold is met, a standard of

14

proportionality in criminal in personam matters needs to

15

be developed as to what is grossly disproportionate.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

And your best guide to the

development is what the district court did here?
MR. BLATT:

I think the district court did a

19

good job, Your Honor, I really do, because they evaluated

20

all the factors, whether the money was lawfully

21

obtained --

QUESTION:

So what guide should an appellate

court -- this is one district judge out of, what --

1

MR. BLATT:

Yes.

Justice Ginsburg, the guide

2

that I would give, and based upon the Alexander remand and

3

Busher, and I do not mean to be presumptuous, is looking

4

at a totality of the circumstances, the gravity of the

5

offense, whether the property was lawfully obtained and

6

for a lawful purpose, the dollar volume of the loss, the

7

existence of a benefit that was to be gained by the

8

defendant -- in this case there was none -- and whether

9

this was part of a criminal enterprise.

10

11
12

I'm sure there are many more factors that this
Court could consider.
QUESTION:

I'm just naming a few.
We've been enforcing customs laws in

MR. BLATT:

Do you know of a single

There has not been one single case,

Your Honor, in reference to that.
QUESTION:

That's what you're saying the

Constitution has been requiring all these 200 years.
MR. BLATT:

That is correct, Your Honor, but

21

after Austin and Alexander, where the Court indicated that

22

fines -- that forfeitures can be considered fines, and

23

therefore punishment does apply, and the Eighth Amendment

24

does apply.

25

other words, there is now a review in reference to

That has changed things.

excessiveness implies an evaluation.
QUESTION:

What about, in terms of a

constitutional limit, a word like shocking?

5

MR. BLATT:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. BLATT:

Shocking?
Mm-hmm.
Well, grossly disproportionate, Your

8

Honor, to me is as close to strict liability as one could

9

get.

I think it's a difficult burden for a defendant to

10

meet under the district court's standards, in a district

11

court, and it's a word, it's a concept that I think

12

district courts are familiar with.

13
14

Shockingly, I'm not too familiar with that.

I

would like --

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. BLATT:

Shocks the conscience.
Will shock the conscience?

I like

17

that, and I think, Your Honor, that taking -- no one is

18

denying that this -- the Government has a strong remedial

19

interest, but perhaps there is something that shocks the

20

conscience when lawful money for a lawful purpose is taken

21

entirely, without any concept of culpability, and I would

22

respectfully indicate that --

23

QUESTION:

Well, except the district said, and

the Government I think concedes they must show that the

that it was illegal to take out more than X amount of

dollars.

MR. BLATT:

No, Your Honor.

It's a strict

liability type of situation.

you don't -- if you go there and you have the money --

6

QUESTION:

You don't have to know.

I thought the Government -- maybe I'm

wrong about this.

it must prove the defendant knew it was unlawful not to

report that he was carrying in excess of $10,000.

No, I don't believe that's the case,

declaring it, for whatever reasons, ignorance of the law,
