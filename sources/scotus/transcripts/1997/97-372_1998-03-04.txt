ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. WALLACE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In this test case for thousands of cases being

3

held in abeyance, a five-judge panel of the Federal

4

Circuit held, with Judge Mayer dissenting, that, as

5

applied to exports, the harbor maintenance tax enacted by

6

Congress in

7

Constitution's export clause rather than, as we contend, a

8

permissible user fee.

9

986 is an invalid tax in violation of the

The provision at issue was enacted as part of

20

the Water Resources Development Act of

21

legislation in more than a decade to authorize development

22

of new facilities in the Nation's harbors.

23

986, the first

There was concern during this period that port

24

development projects in the United States had lagged

25

behind those of other developed countries and that this

1

was contributing to our severe trade imbalance.
At the same time, this was a period in which

2

3

there were large budget deficits and objections to using

4

Federal funding to address this problem, and it was one

5

that, as Judge Mayer pointed out in his dissenting

6

opinion, engaged the attention of Congress over an

7

extended period involving three Congresses and more than 4

8

years of numerous hearings and other activities, and one

9

of the solutions to the funding problem was to craft a

10

system of user fees that would avoid the need for funding

11

out of general revenues.
QUESTION:

12

3

Sort of similar to the last case,

isn't it, trying -- finding someone else to pay.

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. WALLACE:

Well, in this instance there was a

6

practical problem to be addressed.

7

needed and the beneficiaries of these facilities could,

8

under court precedent, be charged user fees to defray the

9

costs of providing these --

QUESTION:

Improvements were

benefit.
QUESTION:

Does the record show, or are there

statistics that we can examine to determine how much of

25

this tax is paid by people who are exporting in contrast

to those who are just shipping from point to point in the

2

United States?

3

MR. WALLACE:

I don't -- off-hand, I'm not able

4

to point to a breakdown in the statistics in the record,

5

not -- certainly not in what we've reproduced in the joint

6

appendix.

7

something on that.

8

9

Perhaps my colleagues will be able to find

I do want to say that the -- one of the most
difficult problems that was faced in this massive

10

legislative consideration was how to craft an equitable

11

and workable system of user fees in the context of the

12

multitude of difficulties that were brought to Congress'

13

attention by various industry and port representatives as

14

well as members of the executive branch.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, one would have thought

16

that if all this attention was devoted to user fees the

17

enactment wouldn't have been called a tax.

18
19

MR. WALLACE:

Well, it perhaps was unfortunate

choice of nomenclature --

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. WALLACE:

-- but as the Court's decisions do

22

make it clear that nomenclature is not in itself

23

controlling.

24

Now - -

QUESTION:

Well, and also this thing is based on

the value of the goods exported, isn't it?

2

MR. WALLACE:

3

QUESTION:

That is correct.

So that you have a little package of

4

computer chips this big that takes no space in the ship at

5

all, and it's going to result in a huge tax, but a big

6

quantity of wheat, that actually does require a large ship

7

to convey it and so forth, might pay substantially less.

8

MR. WALLACE:

9

QUESTION:

10

11

That is --

The value might be less.

It's kind

of an odd sort of a user fee, isn't it?
MR. WALLACE:

That is exactly correct, and if I

12

may I would like to elaborate on this with reference to

13

the legislative consideration of this very issue, but

14

first I just want to interject in response to Justice

15

Kennedy's previous question that on page 63 of the joint

16

appendix there are some statistics that will shed some

17

light on the question that he asked.

18

Now, we have in our references isolated from the

19

massive record of legislative consideration portions which

20

are themselves quite hefty that dealt quite specifically

21

with the user fee problem and, with the Court's

22

permission, I would like to turn briefly to some brief

23

excerpts from a statement that Senator Hatfield made which

24

encapsulates the difficulties and the reasons for the

25

crafting of it.

It's worth -6

QUESTION:

1

How would a statement like that bear

2

on whether or not this is a violation of the Export

3

Clause?

4

MR. WALLACE:

Well, I think it bears on the

5

reasons why the particular kinds of objections that are

6

being raised to the way the fee was crafted may be not

7

aspects of the fee that actually disadvantage exports but

8

to some extent may be aspects that were designed to be

9

advantageous to exports, and also shows the sum of the

10

serious economic dislocations that were sought to be

11

avoided in trying to find an equitable manner of putting

12

this fee together, and I --

13

QUESTION:

I think if you'd had 20 wizards

14

sitting down and coming up with the best possible solution

15

in their view to these sort of -- if it violated the

16

Export Clause it's still bad, isn't it?

17

MR. WALLACE:

Of course, we do not contend that

18

the difficulties and the magnitude of the effort that

19

Congress put in would excuse a constitutional violation,

20

but we do contend that it is too facile for others to

21

contend that a court should ignore these aspects of the

22

legislative consideration and merely hypothesize whether

23

theoretically it could think of a system that might seem

24

more appropriate to the court, which is insulated from the

25

legislative concerns that were before the Congress.

1

No, but you're talking about a user

fee of harbors.

3

do with the ships and the tonnage that's required and how

4

deep the harbor needs to be and how big the dock has to

5

be, and that turns on how large the ship needs to be, and

6

this doesn't bear any relation to that.

7

You'd think that would have something to

MR. WALLACE:

Well, that is part of the reason

8

that it took that many years for the Congress to craft a

9

solution, because they started off with some of those same

10

assumptions, but found that they couldn't work it out that

11

way for very serious reasons.

QUESTION:

All right.

These are brief --

Put it in for what it's worth, Mr.

Wallace.

(Laughter.)

20

MR. WALLACE:

These are brief excerpts of what

21

Congress thought it was doing and why, and I might

22

interject a few comments as I go along here.

23

In Senator Hatfield's statement, and it's in

24

this hearing called User Fees for Ports and Waterways that

1

off pointing out we have not had a major authorization in

2

this area for 15 years.

3

There are many economic and political reasons

4

for this delay, but the resolution of the user fee

5

component is a key element in getting a bill to the floor

and passed.

explore legislative proposals addressing the expectations

8

of the administration for user fees while taking into

9

account the economic realities of the navigation economy

10

5 years ago I convened a bipartisan group to

and the users of the Nation's waterways.
Over that period I've introduced three separate

11
12

and distinct proposals, one of which he explains became

13

the bill that Congress later, shortly thereafter enacted.

14

He then explains, we reserved, meaning rejected

15

in context, user fees based on tonnage because they

16

disproportionately would effect bulk cargo marketability

17

when compared to their impact on containerized cargo.

individually.
QUESTION:

No, but doesn't his statement boil

3

down to saying that a fee which is a real user fee is

4

going to have an economic impact that we don't want.

5

Isn't that what it boils down to?

6

MR. WALLACE:

Well, it depends -- I mean, it's

7

not a real user fee -- tonnage is not the only measure of

8

economic value that someone secures from facilities in

9

these days of containerized --

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. WALLACE:

12

QUESTION:

14

It's a measure of use, isn't it?
It is a measure --

Isn't it closer to being a measure of

use than value?
MR. WALLACE:

It is a measure of use.

If I may

15

just, in answering this, the very next sentence says that

16

a fee based on tonnage also would disadvantage export -

17

dependent ports in contrast to import-dependent ports.

18

One of their concerns was that our export trade

19

would be hurt by a user fee based on this.

20

export was and is bulk commodities, grains, iron ore,

21

which was having difficulty competing in international

22

trade from the Great Lakes ports, which were suffering

23

some depression at the time, lumber, as is pointed out,

24

and other wood products.

of disadvantaging ports with higher operation and

maintenance costs and could cause consolidation of port

facilities to a few super ports.

economic implications for scores of communities across the

country.

This could have severe

So then he explains that the approach they

8

finally chose to adopt is a nationally uniform singleÂ­

9

tier fee based on a percentage of cargo value, and this ad

10

valorem concept, as he explains it, equitably balances

11

containerized versus bulk cargoes, places all ports on an

12

equal footing, and does not affect the marketability of

any product or commodity.

Is that right?

21

MR. WALLACE:

22

QUESTION:

That is --

I mean, I guess -- all your arguments

23

would say, we don't even have a gas tax.

a gas tax.

MR. WALLACE:

It is very similar.

In fact, the

So if we accept your argument there

4

is no gas tax.

It's really a highway user fee and if, in

5

fact, they decided to pay for the ports out of the highway

6

trust fund, then the whole thing's a highway user fee.

7

Maybe it's an income user fee, a facilities user fee,

8

income tax is really a user fee for using the country's

9

facilities.

10

(Laughter.)

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. WALLACE:

How do you draw the line?
We wouldn't go this far, but the

13

particular concern that Congress was addressing here was

14

the disadvantage to the commercial use of our ports and to

15

commerce resulting from the outmoded nature of the

16

facilities.

17

QUESTION:

We can get rid of all the

18

disadvantage to exports by putting the whole thing in the

19

income tax.

20

Maybe it does.

21

That doesn't make the income tax a user fee.

MR. WALLACE:

No, of course not, but it would

22

mean that it would become a matter of general funding.

for user fees, I didn't think that meant any charge

imposed on users.

I -- that would make it no limitation

So long as you impose the tax through users, you

If that limitation is to have any bounds at all,

6

7

it seems to me we must mean by user fee a charge that is

8

based upon the degree of use of the port.
MR. WALLACE:

9

Well,

I think this Court's

10

jurisprudence in distinguishing taxes from user fees shows

11

that it is a more variegated distinction than that.
QUESTION:

12

Not in the Export Clause field.

In

13

other -- you're referring to cases that deal with other

14

provisions of the Constitution, not the Export Clause.
MR. WALLACE:

15

Well, those cases all had their

16

root in a case called Pace v. Burgess, which was an Export

17

Clause case.

18

QUESTION:

And in Pace the Court was at pains to

19

point out that the charge there was not an ad valorem

20

charge.

21

MR. WALLACE:

That is true, but it also made

22

a -- but ad valorem charges have since been upheld as

23

permissible methods of user fees.

MR. WALLACE:

Not under the Export clause.
But in other contexts where

But constitutional objections may be

quite different in different cases.

the Fairbank case deal with those particular -- that

I'm surprised you -- perhaps it's our fault that
you haven't been able to get to those cases yet, but --

We have here a very

Well, I --

--we know the Congress -I'm trying to set this up in

context.
QUESTION:

Yes.

We know that Congress gave its

all on this thing, but now let's look at the law.

5

(Laughter.)

6

MR. WALLACE:

Yes.

Yes, and I have to add one

7

further consideration that inhibited the legislative

8

consideration, and that was it was all done against a

9

backdrop of awareness of our international trade relations

20

and international agreements with our trading partners,

21

which also do not supersede constitutional limitations,

22

but they're relevant to whether Congress was going to be

23

able to solve this user fee question.

24
25

Because those agreements -- it was GATT at that
time, and now WTO -- in which there have been reciprocal

1

reductions of tariffs, those -- there are expectations and

2

obligations that prevent members in those agreements from

3

discriminating against the foreign industry in favor of

4

the domestic industry.

5

And even though the measure adopted here was one

6

that generally would be favorable to exports as against

7

imports, the ad valorem method, for reasons that Senator

8

Hatfield explained, that could be defensible under these

9

agreements, but to charge user fees to imports and not to

0

exports in these same harbors could be a basis for

11

objections and retaliation by our trading partners as a

12

disguised form of raising our tariffs again, and --

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, is that why you

4

suggested that maybe this -- if we ruled against you the

5

whole thing would fall?

6

In page

That sort of surprised me.

8, footnote 8 of your brief you say

7

that if the decision of the court of appeals stands, that

8

would effectively abolish the trust fund.

9

the harbor maintenance tax in its entirety, and I had been

It would void

20

thinking up till now, well, no, it would only excise the

2

export feature of it, and now you're suggesting well,

22

maybe the import would also fall?

23

MR. WALLACE:

No, we really meant that in

24

context only for exporters, but there is -- I don't want

25

to suggest that this would not be severable, but the

1

concern about possible retaliation by our trading partners

2

in saying that we've in disguise raised our tariff rates

3

again and so they're going to raise theirs, that would not

4

only affect the public interest in our balance of trades,

5

but it would directly affect exporters from this country.

6

It would be something that would burden exports from this

7

country.
QUESTION:

8

9
10

But it would be applied to them the

same way it would apply to shipping, say, from New York to
Texas?
MR. WALLACE:

11

No.

I'm talking about retaliation

12

by our trading partners.

13

tariffs, that makes it harder for industries in this

14

country that wish to export to be able to export.

15

QUESTION:

If they then raise their

Well, I take it it's more serious

16

than that.

If we strike down the export provision and

17

require refunds, but the importers can't get any refunds,

18

then we're in violations of the agreement.
MR. WALLACE:

19

Well, I wouldn't go so far as to

20

say we're necessarily in violations, although a foreign

21

country, one of our trading partners might make such a

22

claim before the World Trade Organization, but they also

23

could use this as a reason to impose retaliatory measures.

24
25

Congress was faced with a very complex problem
here.

The Constitution is designed for modern commerce as

1

well as for the commerce that was known at the time that

2

these provisions were adopted, and we think that the court

3

of appeals was right in pointing to this Court's user fee

4

jurisprudence which has been developed in detail in fields

5

other than the Export Clause after Pace v. Burgess.

6

QUESTION:

Well, if a provision is under

7

alternative 1 a tax on imports and exports, it doesn't

8

seem to me that that makes it any more or any less a user

9

fee under any other alternative.

10

MR. WALLACE:

11

QUESTION:

Well --

In other words, you're -- I

12

understand the problem the Congress was faced with.

13

can't tax imports -- exports.

14

it taxes imports and exports it's no longer an export tax.

15

Well, we understand that from the

arguing that this is a permissible user fee, which is one

19

of the arguments we had made right along in the case and,

20

indeed, had always been our principal argument, and it

21

satisfies the basic classic attribute of a user fee that

22

has been developed in many aspects of the Court's

jurisprudence.

which the vessel owners could then pass on in the form of

costs to the users of their vessels, I think you'd have a

good argument that it's a user fee, but the nature of this

makes it awfully hard to see it as a user fee.

6

MR. WALLACE:

Well, the Court in the Evansville-

7

Vanderburgh case did say that it seemed to the Court in

8

that context to make no difference whether it was assessed

9

on the airline or on the passenger, because it came down

10

to the same thing.

The costs were to be passed along to

There was a very practical reason for asking the

3

shippers to be the ones to make the payment, and that was

4

that the carrier would not be in a position -- once

5

Congress decided that the ad valorem measure was the only

6

equitable one that they could hope to impose, the carriers

7

would not be in a position to know the value of the cargo.

8

And one of the principles that this Court has

9

recognized repeatedly in giving legislative latitude in

administrative expenses that will make the fee more

burdensome and more onerous for everybody, that there are

virtues in keeping it simple.

2

or the other, and Congress tried to craft this in a manner

3

that would impose the least burden and would avoid severe

economic dislocations in the country.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, can I ask you, do we

6

have a definition of user fee?

7

argument is that as long as the fee is paid by users and

8

the money is used for the purpose of improving ports,

9

that's enough.

10

12

MR. WALLACE:

It seems to me your

That is enough to make it a user

fee, and it's a permissible user fee.
QUESTION:

But is that -- is -- do I correctly

13

state your position, and if that's true, could you impose

14

a 10-percent tax on the income of every user and then put

15

it in this fund?

16

MR. WALLACE:

Well, if it -- that would have

17

much more difficulty meeting this Court's criteria for

what is a valid user fee.

Well, you know, that is -- an ad

applications that could be improved upon in a more Utopian

greater benefits in terms of enhancement of value from the

true that any definition of user fee, which simply defines

it as a -- you know, a fee imposed on users, and which

1

MR. ATWOOD:

2

3

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

4

First, I'd like to supplement the answer to

5

Justice Kennedy's question about what data is in the

6

record.

7

updated material about the relative charge on exports and

8

imports in domestic commerce, and in the amicus brief of

9

the Aluminum Company of America they had the most recent,

10

Also in the appendix at page 97 is some more

997 data.

11

Basically it tells the same story, and that is

2

that exports have paid between 25 and 30 percent of this

3

tax over the years, and the amount that the exports now

4

pay is less than the annual surpluses accumulated, so you

5

could eliminate exports entirely from this tax and there

6

would still be more revenue coming in than the Government

7

is spending on harbor maintenance.

8

20
2

QUESTION:

That would translate into a tax,

then, on imports only, and I think would raise serious
discrimination problems under trade agreements.
MR. ATWOOD:

Well, this -- if there is an

22

international issue there, it can be solved in the same

23

way the export problems can be solved, which is to make

24

this a legitimate user fee.

the fact that they thought they had negotiated ad valorem

2

duties of a certain level and now the United States is

3

imposing ad valorem charges on top of that, and that's the

problem and the import problem.

QUESTION:

In fact, I guess the fund has quite a

MR. ATWOOD:

QUESTION:

I hope I can call it a tax, because that's what Congress

called it -- was a result of a very complex, delicate

legislative process and important compromises were made

and sophisticated judgments as to what was possible and

QUESTION:

Mr. Atwood,

Right.
And Mr. Wallace, if I understood him

MR. ATWOOD:

We are not arguing that there is no

There must be a demonstrable service provided to

Court need not anticipate every possible cost theory that

might be advanced, but an ad valorem tax based on a
