ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN T. MONTGOMERY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. MONTGOMERY:
please the Court.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

This case presents the question left

10

open in prior cases concerning the extent to which the

11

Fifth Amendment places any restriction on the power of

12

Congress to impose retroactive liability on private

13

parties to fund social programs.

14

The Coal Act of 1992 is an unprecedented statute

15

as applied to Eastern Enterprises and it is contrary to

16

the constitutional traditions embodied in the Fifth

17

Amendment for two distinct reasons.

18

violates the Due Process Clause because it changes the

19

legal consequences of past employment relationships that

20

concluded long ago at a time when Eastern could not have

21

anticipated any future obligation to former employees.

22

QUESTION:

Are you arguing substantive due

23

process or procedural due process?

24

MR. MONTGOMERY:

25

First, the Coal Act

Your Honor, we have attempted

to the best we can not to put a label, but if a label is

QUESTION:

3

you are going to persuade us.

4

I suggest you are going to have to if

MR. MONTGOMERY:

Your Honor,

if a label must be

5

placed it would have to be substantive due process but as

6

we have pointed out in our briefs,

7

to protect here are largely procedural values.

The

in understanding the consequences of

It is procedural in that sense,

I suppose

10

in the way that the void for vagueness doctrine is

11

procedural.

12

QUESTION:

You went -- it went through the

13

legislative process.

14

process you are entitled to.

15

substantive claim.

16

That's probably all a procedural due

MR. MONTGOMERY:

You fall back on a

Certainly the Court has

17

restricted procedural due process to the legislative

18

process in the past and we don't mean to suggest that in

19

order to prevail in this case the Court needs to create a

20

new doctrine.

21

QUESTION:

And substantive due process as you

22

know is not in good odor with regard to economic rights

23

for some reason, although we still apply it with respect

24

to noneconomic rights.

25

MR. MONTGOMERY:

It certainly has not been in

good favor for some decades, Justice Scalia.

2

however, has been very careful in its decisions not to

3

suggest that there were not limits to the power of

4

Congress to enact retroactive legislation, and we are here

5

to say that this is the case which crosses that border.

6

QUESTION:

The Court,

Well, if your client is not, maybe

7

as sympathetic a client as some of the ones talked about

8

in some of the amicus briefs filed in this case.

9

Eastern sold the coal mining operation to a wholly owned

10

I guess

subsidiary in effect.

11

MR. MONTGOMERY:

12

QUESTION:

We transferred --

And then there was cross management.

13

I mean, some of the same managers of Eastern were also

14

managers of the subsidiary corporation, so Eastern doesn't

15

come here in the same shoes as some of the amici.

16

MR. MONTGOMERY:

We are certainly not in the

17

same shoes of those amici who have been driven into

18

bankruptcy, but in terms of the analytical application of

19

the statute to Eastern, liability has been imposed on

20

Eastern solely because it was an employer of miner's

21

before 1946.

22

QUESTION:

Let me ask you one more question and

23

then I'll subside here.

24

reimbursement.

25

liability incurred here?

You have a right of

Is that right?

MR. MONTGOMERY:

1

Section 9706(f), Justice

2

O'Connor, preserves to Eastern any right that it may have

3

had to seek recovery from its subsidiary or the party to

4

whom it sold the subsidiary, Peabody Coal.

5

does not create any new right of action.
QUESTION:

6

7

Did Eastern preserve a right of

recovery against its subsidiary?
MR. MONTGOMERY:

8

9

The statute

In the action, in the third

party action that we filed below, we alleged that we do

10

have a right.

I will tell the Court that if to the extent

11

that we have a right is a right in implied indemnity.

12

There were no documents that passed between Eastern and

13

its subsidiary or between Eastern and Peabody Holding

14

Company which specifically spoke to the possibility of

15

future statutory liability, and in the event that we are

16

unsuccessful here, we will be left with that third party

17

action in the District of Massachusetts in which we will

18

attempt to advance our right to obtain recovery on an

19

indemnification or contribution ground.
QUESTION:

20

Does the record tell us the amount

21

and the extent of the liability and the number of the

22

employees?

23

Is that -- is that known at this time?
MR. MONTGOMERY:

Justice Kennedy, the record

24

tells us that as of the time that we filed this lawsuit

25

that 1,400 employees, former employees or their spouses

had been assigned to Eastern.

Since the lawsuit was

2

filed, we have had additional assignments, but those are

3

not part of the record.
With respect to the amount of the liability, it

4
5

is an annual premium that's established by the combined

6

fund.

7

lawsuit was filed, and Mr. Harper's affidavit is in the

8

record to this effect, that the actuarial calculation of

9

the liability was in the vicinity of $100 million.

The record is undisputed that at the time that the

QUESTION:

10

But that's disputed to the extent, at

11

least, that you would have a deduction for that expense,

12

so that would bring that down a considerable amount

13

without any other factor.

14

MR. MONTGOMERY:

Certainly, Justice Ginsburg,

15

and we are not attaching any special significance to the

16

amount of money.

17

QUESTION:

May I ask you, your position is that

18

Eastern, which severed its relationship with these

19

employees many decades ago, should not be responsible.

20

your theory, if any private party in this picture,

21

Eastern's successors, can anybody compatibly with

22

substantive due process or the Takings Clause be

23

responsible or is this the kind of obligation that can be

24

thrust only on the public as a whole through the revenue

25

system?

On

MR. MONTGOMERY:

1

The test that we have suggested

2

here, and that we think is reflected in the Court's

3

precedence such as Concrete Pipe and Turner Elkhorn is

4

whether a party upon whom Congress seeks to impose a

5

retroactive liability has some reasonable basis to

6

anticipate.
QUESTION:

7

Is there anybody -- let's take this

8

case specifically.

9

suppose the tax -- scratch that.
Suppose this liability had been imposed on

10
11

Peabody.

12

due process?

13

Are either of the successors --

Under your theory, would that be compatible with

MR. MONTGOMERY:

There is a class of companies

14

that are included within the Coal Act that we believe

15

properly bear that responsibility.

QUESTION:

the business.

QUESTION:

But which -- these are -- these are

miners who stopped working in the mines in the 1960s.

MR. MONTGOMERY:

QUESTION:

That's right.

Who in this picture would be

responsible for them?

miners and their spouses assigned to Eastern will then be

2

reassigned under the priority scheme set forth in the

3

statute to other companies for whom those miners worked or

4

in the absence of such a company will be assigned to

5

what's called the orphan pool.

6

QUESTION:

Would that be compatible with due

7

process, just concentrating on the people who never worked

8

for any existing company?

9
10

MR. MONTGOMERY:
QUESTION:

Certainly.

These employees, these very

11

employees, would it be compatible with due process to

12

distribute them among employers who never had any

13

employment relationship with them?

14
15

MR. MONTGOMERY:
QUESTION:

Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg.

What was the notice?

What was the

16

expectation that these present companies had that this

17

would occur?

18

categorical as to say that Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical

19

presents no due process problem.

20

I don't wish to be categorical as to every single company.

21

There are certainly other companies that may have as

22

applied complaints to present with respect to the

23

application to them.

24

opposed retroactively on those who participated in a

25

multiemployer plan, at least beginning in 1978, which

I'm not sure -- how you can be so

QUESTION:

of that plan.

remote from responsibility as you are.

MR. MONTGOMERY:

But for employees who were never beneficiaries

Some of them may be, Your

Honor, but those --

QUESTION:

8

MR. MONTGOMERY:

9

QUESTION:

Which ones wouldn't be?
Well, certainly --

Which ones who never employed these

10

people or their decedents would be any closer to

11

responsibility.
QUESTION:

12

~N

I mean, it seems to me that they are as

Justice Scalia, it's critical to

3

understand that those who signed collective bargaining

4

agreements from period to period, when they executed those

5

agreements, they undertook an obligation to the very

6

employees who have been assigned to Eastern, the very

7

individuals who were beneficiaries of each of those plans.

8
9
20

QUESTION:

But they didn't undertake this

obligation.
MR. MONTGOMERY:

They undertook -- they undertook

21

an obligation that was at least as extensive as this

22

obligation.

23

QUESTION:

No, but the fact that I agree to do

24

something for a certain amount -- I don't quite understand

25

your distinction.

1

MR. MONTGOMERY:

I agree with that. There are

2

various classes that are included in the statute.

And I

3

don't want to confuse the Court.

4

to the class of so-called 1988 signatories, those who

5

signed the last collective bargaining agreement at a time

6

when deficits began to develop in this plan because they

7

lowered the rate of contribution to fund the benefits,

8

including the benefits to these employees, and when that

9

plan started to develop those deficits, we do submit that

Certainly with respect

10

it would have been perfectly within Congress' authority to

11

say that all of those companies should have understood

12

that when they made changes in the plans that took the

13

plans into a deficit position, they should have understood

14

once the initial legislative interest was expressed in

15

this subject in 1989 by Senator Rockefeller shortly after

16

the execution of that agreement, that there was some

17

reasonable possibility that Congress may step in and

18

rescue the plans.

19

QUESTION:

Well, shouldn't, shouldn't you by a

20

similar line of reasoning or shouldn't Eastern have

21

understood that whatever its obligations may be, and I

22

realize those are in question, but whatever its

23

obligations may be, may be affected by the actions of the

24

independent trustees so that it at any time in the future

1

action.

Imprudent action in determining the amount of

2

assessments what makes them might very well result in an

3

added liability to you or to Eastern many, many years

4

hence.
So I don't see a distinction in kind between

5
6

what you have just described as the, as the latter

7

imprudent consequences, consequence of imprudence in the

8

anticipation that you should have made or Eastern should

9

have made in imprudent consequences?
MR. MONTGOMERY:

10

I would suggest that there is

11

a difference of more than a degree, Justice Souter,

12

anticipating congressional action within a year or two

13

after a particular development in the history of the plan,

14

another over a generation.

15

QUESTION:

in

With respect, perhaps congressional

16

action might be difficult to anticipate, but the need for

17

some action even if it be a lawsuit, judicial action,

18

possibly,

to enforce a liability thought to have been

19

incurred,

that certainly is not difficult to anticipate.

20

QUESTION:

Well,

I suppose it's your position

21

that the liability only extended for the life of the

22

contract?

23
24
25

MR. MONTGOMERY:

That's certainly the case,

our liability -QUESTION:

I mean,

that much was clear.

It

and

1

wasn't like one of these long-term continuously extended

2

benefit plans.

3

They had a limited term.

MR. MONTGOMERY:

Is that right?

That's exactly right and prior

4

to

5

defined benefit -- excuse me, defined contribution

6

contracts.

965 as to the contracts that we signed, those were

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. MONTGOMERY:

9
10

Limited to the contribution?
Limited to the contribution

without any agreement as to defined benefits.
QUESTION:

But the other side says that, that

11

Congress found that you had created an expectation of

12

lifetime benefits, even though you are only making defined

3

contributions, you had created an expectation.

4

your response to that?

5

MR. MONTGOMERY:

What is

Justice Scalia, the Congress

6

only made one finding, and that finding is in the preamble

7

to the statute, and that finding simply says that those,

8

that the Congress seeks to attach liabilities to those

9

most responsible for planned liabilities, period.

20
21

22

QUESTION:

And the rest is from the commission

report which the Congress did not itself adopt.
MR. MONTGOMERY:

Did not itself adopt.

23

That's exactly correct.

24

certainly is prominent in the judicial decisions that have

25

upheld the Coal Act.

QUESTION:

1

If in fact in respect to expectations

2

you had never formed a separate subsidiary, imagine you

3

had never formed it and you stayed in business until 1987,

4

then would you think it was constitutional for Congress to

5

impose upon you the obligation that you are talking about

6

today?

7

MR. MONTGOMERY:

Not at all because it would not

8

have been reasonable on the expectations argument, Justice

9

Breyer, for miners or their spouses to develop any

10

expectation at all as a result of Eastern's conduct.
QUESTION:

11

So in your view if you had been in

12

business until 1987 and all the companies that were in

13

business up until 1992 or '93 or before this very act was

14

passed, it's constitutional in your view for Congress to

15

sell these companies in the mining industry that you have

16

to take care of the miners who were there previous to

17

1992?

18

MR. MONTGOMERY:

Perhaps I misunderstood your

19

question.

20

the extent that Congress noted that we were in the

21

business until 1987 --

22

If your question is, is it unconstitutional to

QUESTION:

No.

I'm trying to pretend that you

23

never formed a separate subsidiary and therefore you

24

continued to do business, everything else is the same, but

25

you just did business without your separate subsidiary.

1

You were the subsidiary so you left in '87 instead of

2

leaving in '65.

3

unconstitutional for Congress to impose this very

obligation upon you?

12

I'm saying then in your opinion is it

MR. MONTGOMERY:

Our position here would be far

weaker if we had never -QUESTION:

Yes, but I want to know if you think

it is or isn't unconstitutional?
MR. MONTGOMERY:

I think it is not unless this

Court is willing.
QUESTION:

Then your position is that in fact

they can't impose these obligations on anybody, however

3

long they stayed in as long as they left prior to this

4

very law being passed; is that right?

5

MR. MONTGOMERY:

Justice Breyer I want --

6

meaning to be clear, I think this Court would have to

7

extend Concrete Pipe in order for liability to attach to

8

companies that were in business up until

9
20

QUESTION:

987 or

988 --

But is --

MR. MONTGOMERY:

-- this Court could do that,

21

and I think it is only a modest extension, but I do not

22

believe that it is constitutional absent that, that

23

determination by this Court.

24
25

QUESTION:

All right.

So you think you have a

stronger case because you left in '65?

1

MR. MONTGOMERY:

2

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

All right.

Now is your case stronger

3

in any respect at all but for you have some expectation

4

that Congress won't pierce corporate veils?
MR. MONTGOMERY:

5

Congress considered the extent

6

to which it ought to pierce the corporate veil, and it did

7

not.

8

QUESTION:

Yes.

9

MR. MONTGOMERY:

10

reasonable, we believe --

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. MONTGOMERY:

All right.
Our expectation clearly was

Well --- because we had a well

13

capitalized subsidiary that made all of the contributions

14

that were asked of it and remained in business.

15

QUESTION:

That's very helpful because what I

16

get from your answer is that's right.

17

saying the only additional expectation you have is that

18

Congress won't engage in veil piercing and then you went

19

on to answer just what was the next thing in my mind, is

20

is that a reasonable expectation given that Congress has

21

passed quite a few statutes that pierce veils, CERCLA,

22

states pierce veils, veil piercing is not an unknown thing

23

and therefore how reasonable is that expectation.

24

you began to answer that and I'd like you to continue.

25

MR. MONTGOMERY:

I think you are

Now,

1

Congress also pierced the veil and set up a category of

2

responsible parties called related persons.

3

under that veil piercing mechanism, is not a related

4

person, and we think in that regard, Congress got it right

5

as to Eastern.
QUESTION:

6

Mr. Montgomery, I think you are

7

saying that it doesn't matter what your expectation was,

8

that even if your expectation was that there would be no

9

veil piercing, that expectation has not been frustrated.

10
11

MR. MONTGOMERY:

13

It has not been frustrated,

that's absolutely correct, Justice Scalia.

Eastern,

QUESTION:

That the basis for your liability

that under the Taft-Hartley Act independent trustees are

not representatives of the company and are not entitled.

QUESTION:

Well, I would agree with you there

but the whole line of questioning I think starts with the

12

assumption that we are going to consider the commission

14

consider it, your burden is to say that simply is not --

15

that is not a reasonable statement of findings that can be

16

taken into consideration, and I suppose one item of

17

evidence on that would be the fact that somebody, a

18

trustee, who was theoretically neither for you nor for

them was saying something very similar to that in 1950.

And I think that affects your burden is my only point.

21

MR. MONTGOMERY:

And my response is largely the

same, and that is if the statement is looked at in

13

Congress determined that the cost of furnishing health

benefits to retirees and their families which benefits

were at risk in 1992 should be borne by participants in

the industry rather than by the public at large.

by those companies that had actually employed the miners.

Congress -- the Act rests on a determination or judgment

that the miners had legitimate expectations that these

Two answers to that, if I may.

The first is if we are looking, if we are looking at

10

expectations, I think it's proper to look both at the

11

expectations, look at the expectations of both parties to

12

the contractual relationship and an important part of that

13

expectation here is that this was -- this -- the employer

14

didn't just hire somebody during the term of the contract.

15

The employee during that term of the contract accrued

16

service credits that enabled the person upon retirement to

17

get the very benefits we are talking about here.

18

example, and this is highly instructive, Sam East, who is

19

the miner whose assignment to Eastern triggered this

That the employee -- employers

look at the fact that every time there was an effort to

Mr. Kneedler, may I ask you if you

can differentiate the following case from what's going on

here.

since World War II, when there was an executive order that

says industry, you should pay minimum in the same for the

people would be paid equally without regard to sex.

Suppose Congress had said in '63 and not only

prospectively must the pay be equal but we are going to

reach back to the date of that executive order and every

because this Act only addresses health benefits

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

Again, what we are seeing today,

what Congress saw in the early 1990s was the, the

consequences of a, of a pattern of conduct and collective

bargaining that began in the 1950s with a guarantee of

MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, Your Honor, the possibility

2

of alternative funding is not,

3

care costs for 6,628 people could be paid for, I suspect,

4

out of the Treasury.

5

Your Honor is aware, for that money.

of the things that --

QUESTION:

-- I mean, sure, the health

But there are competing demands, as
And Congress -- one

6,628 are assigned to companies like

8

Eastern but that have no subsidiary that was in the

9

business after '78?

10

MR. BUSCEMI:

That's right.

And that includes,

11

I should say that includes the 1,332 because that includes

12

the 1,332 that Eastern has because --

13

QUESTION:

But Eastern had a subsidiary.

14

MR. BUSCEMI:

Eastern had a subsidiary but when

15

the funds list Eastern because of the point that Justice

16

Scalia made, we list Eastern in the pre-'78 group.

17

QUESTION:

What I'm trying to think of is the

18

practical effect because if you were to win the case on

19

the alternate ground involving the subsidiary whether in

20

fact that would leave a lot of the miners, let's say, out

21

in the cold.

22

MR. BUSCEMI:

It would be about 5,000

23

beneficiaries out of the 76,000 that would still be left

24

that have been assigned to pre-'78 signatories.

don't have subsidiaries?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Yes, Your Honor.

One of the

3

things that we sort of have overlooked here is what

4

situation Congress considered.

5

about this alternative. Congress thought about weaving it

6

to collective bargaining.

7

going to work because the people weren't around.

8

less than half of the beneficiaries who are assigned to

9

people who were signatories to the current agreement.

Congress didn't just think

That they recognized wasn't
We have

10

Congress thought about just imposing the liability on the

11

'78 or later signatories.

12

QUESTION:

Well, Congress actually passed a bill

13

that didn't have this reach-back provision in it but it

14

was vetoed, wasn't it?

15

MR. BUSCEMI:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

Yes.

So then they put in the reach-back

thing that we are talking about now.
MR. BUSCEMI:

The bill was a little different,

19

Justice O'Connor, the bill had two features.

20

to those beneficiaries who could be assigned to former

21

employers that had signed the '78 or later agreement,

22

those former employers had to pay.

23

beneficiaries who could not be assigned either because

24

they had no former employer in business or because it was

25

all pre-1978, there was a fee imposed across the board on

relationship to the collective bargain multiemployer

system, and that bill was part of a larger bill, an

omnibus tax bill, that was vetoed, and of course we don't

know precisely why it was vetoed.

was nothing in the veto message that specified any

objection to that particular bill.

and as I understand the argument here, Petitioner says

We do know that there

Congress made the

that any of these decisions that Congress might have made

would have been fine except for the one that they did

make.

could have imposed it on the coal industry.

have imposed it only on the '78 or later signatories.

They could have imposed it on the '88 signatories.

that would have been fine.

Circuit said in upholding the statute in the LTV case,

20

this system contained this latent problem or what the

21

Court of Appeals called the latent loophole from the

22

beginning because as employers like Eastern accorded their

23

beneficiaries service credits and built up that 20 years

that you needed to get the health care, those, and

beneficiaries were accumulating and they were staying
