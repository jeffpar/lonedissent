ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROGER B. ADLER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ADLER:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is about whether Congress' use of a

12

13

wilful mens rea standard in title 18 U.S.C. 924(a)(1)(D)

14

requires proof of knowledge of Federal licensure.

Mr. Adler, our acoustics are very

MR. ADLER:

Yes, Your Honor.

19

Petitioner urges the Court and petitioner adopts

20

the reasoning of the Circuit Courts of Appeal of the

21

Third, Fifth, Seventh, Ninth, and Eleventh in following

22

this Court's holding in Ratzlaf v. the United States that

23

wilfully, as used in this statute, requires proof of

24

actual knowledge of licensure.

Here, this Court should know that the -3

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Adler, do you take the position

2

that, in order to act wilfully within the meaning of this

3

particular statute, that the defendant has to have

4

knowledge of the specific statutory provision?

5

MR. ADLER:

No, Your Honor.

We part company

6

with the Government by indicating that it is knowledge

7

that there is a Federal licensing requirement.

8

9

defendant, beyond a -QUESTION:

10

Chapter

Well, you urge, then, that the

11

defendant has to know there is a Federal licensing

12

requirement for gun dealers?
MR. ADLER:

13

Yes, Your Honor, knowledge or

14

suspicion of the existence of a State licensing

15

requirement, municipal ordinance or the like, will not

16

suffice under respect for federalism this statute

17

penalizes, as only it can, a violation of a Federal

18

licensing requirement, and --

19

QUESTION:

It isn't enough for him to know he

20

can't sell firearms with out a license, generally?

21

to know that he can't sell it without a Federal license?
MR. ADLER:

22

That is what Congress wrote.

He has

That

was the intent of the drafters of the Firearm Owners

25

may.

1

The Government in this case has knowingly chosen

2

to pick the most difficult subdivision under section 924

3

by proceeding to prosecute under subdivision (a)( )(D).

4

It chose not to prosecute on a lesser standard

5

of knowingly for making a false statement in the context

of the application to acquire the weapon under

It chose not to prosecute under

QUESTION:

8 U.S.C.

It chose not to

Well, why would the Congress want to

11

exonerate or not to punish under this statute a man who

12

was quite sure that a license was required but he thought

3

it was a State license.

4

MR. ADLER:

5

QUESTION:

Congress -You say respect for federalism means

6

that we have to accept your view that he has to know that

7

it's a Federal statute.

8

wanted to punish people who had a guilty mind and who were

9

dealing in drugs knowing -- or dealing in weapons knowing

It seems to me that Congress

20

that it was illegal to transfer without a license, and the

2

fact that State, municipal, Federal license, it seems to

22

me certainly the state of mind is the same.

23

MR. ADLER:

Well, quite to the contrary, and I

24

think it has to be viewed in the following context,

25

Justice Kennedy.

A majority of the States do not have

3

No, but in the hypothetical case he

thinks that -- he knows that there -- what he's doing is

illegal, and he knows that it's illegal because he doesn't

And your answer to Justice O'Connor and I think

He's not sure if the license is State or

also to Justice Scalia was, he has to know that it's a

10

Federal requirement.

11

MR. ADLER:

12

QUESTION:

That's correct.
And I'm asking, why would Congress

13

want to exonerate him in the first instance where he

14

thinks it's a State license.

15

served by that?
MR. ADLER:

16

What possible function is

Part of the background to the

17

enactment of the so-called FOPA statute in 1986 reflected,

18

as the legislative history indicates, a concern by the

19

Congress.

20

A 7-year effort was mounted in order to react to

21

complaints from those who were gun enthusiasts who

22

believed that, since the 1968 statute went into effect,

23

the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms had

24

been too overzealous, had targeted unfairly, and basically

25

come down upon those who enjoyed utilizing firearms, going

The basis of --

What was that statute you said, the

Is that what you said?

MR. ADLER:

(Laughter.)

MR. ADLER:

Firearm Owners Protection Act.

And, indeed -- and, indeed, the very

7

statute, I respectfully submit, Justice Scalia, sends the

8

message to the court of the intent of the drafters of the

9

Congress.

10

It was intended to provide protection to firearm

11

owners, dealers, and the like.

12

more difficult for the Government to convict individuals

13

of violating the statute, and this particular subdivision,

14

and the only subdivision which is before this Court in

15

this case, deals with the section of the statute which,

16

following a textual analysis, chose the mens rea standard

17

of wilfully, a --

QUESTION:

It was intended to make it

Mr. Adler, supposing you were to

19

accept, hypothetically, the idea that all that was

20

required under (D) was to know that there was a licensing

21

requirement, be it State or Federal, the district court,

22

as I understand this case, charged that the Government is

23

not required to prove that petitioner knew that a license

24

was required.

I would think even if you accepted

hypothetically the idea that it could be knowledge of a

2

State requirement, that instruction would be contrary to

3

that view.

4

MR. ADLER:

That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

5

As a matter of fact, Justice Trager, in denying the

6

request to charge, I think wrote the ticket that brings me

7

before your -- this panel today.
On page

8 of the appendix Justice Trager

directs me, go to the Supreme Court and see if they agree,

10

I will not put the end to this statute, and so at that

11

request I have brought myself to Washington to urge this

12

Court to give meaning to subdivision ( )(D), which

3

indicates that a wilful standard, which as Justice White,

4

writing in Cheek v. the United States, indicated was a

5

voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty,

6

and in this case the known legal duty is the duty to have

7

a Federal firearm dealers license.

Mr. Adler, why do you need to put
If I read from the charge, in this case

MR. ADLER:

I appreciate that, Justice Ginsburg

1

deficient because it failed to require a finding of

2

petitioner's knowledge that a Federal firearm dealer's

3

license was required.

4

MR. ADLER:

Yes, and petitioner's position is

5

that the Congress lacks the power to create a Federal

6

crime for failing to follow a municipal county or State

7

statute that may relate to dealership and, indeed, the

8

legislative intent in the statute was clear.
The villain perceived by the drafters of the

9
10

amendment -- and there was a unique legislative history,

11

7-year effort, a discharge petition getting this

12

legislation out of the Judiciary Committee.

13

clearly a regional effort of those who were close to gun

14

users and possessors who wanted to trim the tail of the

15

Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.

This was

The legislative debates, with the greatest

16
17

respect, Justice O'Connor, are devoid of an indication of

18

a concern that the firearm enthusiasts had a problem with

19

State or local individuals, so the statute was clearly

20

aimed at the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and

21

Firearms.

We have a troika of three reasons which

basically support our -- petitioner's view that knowledge

of licensure is required.

environment and to hold corporations to a higher standard

And lastly,

9

the congressional report which, as

10

the Chief Justice has noted on prior occasions such as in

11

Garcia v. The United States,

is marked as the defining

12

document to which the Court,

if it reaches legislative

13

intent,

MR. ADLER:

We must presume that all officials,

12

knowledge of the law -- Section 922(b)(3)

supporting the notion that the Congress understood that it

inserts a presumption that the seller of the

-- once again

to the extent that there might be a class

16

of individuals who would not necessarily know the law of

18

inserted a presumption in order to deal with that

19

situation.

20

No presumption is found in subdivision (D),

distinction between knowingly, the word knowingly, the

3

4

MR. ADLER:

(B),

(C), and the word wilfully in

Oh, I think the use of wilfully in

5

subdivision (D) connotes the highest mens rea standard

6

that our law, our criminal law recognizes, whereas

7

knowingly speaks to only an awareness of one's acts, or

8

conduct.

9

When we speak of wilfully violates, and the

10

section says a provision of this chapter, it is much

11

similar to Justice Ginsburg's opinion for the Court in

12

Ratzlaf v. the United States.

13

conduct but this section of this chapter, so when we see

14

wilfully married to a chapter, a clause, a section, then

15

we know that the Congress has telegraphed the intent that

16

wilfully modifies in this case the chapter, and it is

17

knowledge of the chapter which the statute requires.

18

QUESTION:

Wilfully modifies not

Well, now, you say that we know that

19

Congress has married wilfully to the chapter.

20

I don't quite follow that.

21

MR. ADLER:

I must say

Well, a reading of section

22

924(a)(1)(D) indicates, most respectfully, that it

23

punishes those who wilfully violate any provision of this

24

chapter, and so the use of the term, wilfully violates any

25

section of this chapter, connotes it is wilfully violates

The prior three subdivisions, most respectfully,

4

we concede speak to merely engaging in knowing behavior

and not wilful behavior.

7

you're aware of the act that you're performing.
MR. ADLER:

8

9

And you say knowingly simply means

And don't act by reason of mistake

or misapprehension of the law, but so it's clear, we

10

concede that one could wilfully violate this chapter by

11

engaging in what is frequently called conscious avoidance

12

behavior of a kind such as if there were a sign posted in

3

a gunshop and a particular defendant operated through what

4

is sometimes called straw purchases, sending in an

5

accomplice to purchase the weapon.

6

That would provide no defense in a prosecution

7

for wilfully, because the individual acted in a way to

8

consciously avoid gaining knowledge that was readily

9

apparent.

20

QUESTION:

I thought they were straw persons

21

used here, and there was misrepresentation of the

22

purchaser's criminal record and, unlike Ratzlaf and the

23

Cheek case, where the conduct looked okay, except that

24

there was a statute that said no structuring on the one

point that I think Justice O'Connor raised, which is

it seems to request an instruction that he has to know the

indifference to the requirements of the law.

QUESTION:

Well now, Mr. Jones, do you think the

5

word wilfully just has a uniform meaning no matter what

6

the other context in which Congress has used it?

7
8

MR. JONES:

No.

It clearly has a meaning that

can depend upon context.

9

QUESTION:

And here you have it juxtaposed with

10

three previous sections, all of which used the word

11

knowingly.
MR. JONES:

12

Yes, and the word knowingly, as this

13

Court has said in cases like Staples, is simply knowledge

14

of the facts.

QUESTION:

Knowledge that -- conscious of your

actions.
MR. JONES:

That's right.

Knowledge of the

18

facts that constitute the violation.

definition of wilfulness is something in addition.

Now, in only two cases has this Court imposed a

6

higher standard for wilfulness, the standard for which the

7

petitioner argues, which is a knowing violation of a known

legal duty, and in those two precise contexts the Court

made clear that it was adopting a special rule for the

special facts of the statutes that were then before it.

That's the tax case -The tax cases --- and the welfare -- the food

You're

MR. JONES:

I -- the only -- the only -- the

hesitation that I have is that the Court has adopted a

variety of formulations that address this ordinary meaning

7

of wilfulness, and I'm a little bit uncomfortable in

saying that you can pick out a single one of them and be

certain that it accomplishes everything that the Court has

done with the other formulations.

1

the word, and so I think that's precisely why the Court

2

has adopted broader formulations.

3

I want to -- I think one thing that's a little

4

bit confusing here is the fact that the statute talks

5

about what is criminal as a wilful violation and

6

petitioner says, oh well, how can you wilfully violate a

7

law if you don't know what the law means?

8

The answer to that is in the Court's opinion in
the International Minerals case, where the Court had a

10

similar statute, and what the Court explained was that

11

that is a shorthand.

MR. JONES:

In Murdock

Murdock would have

been a statute that contained separate offenses for

knowing and wilful, but that's not the issue there.

4

QUESTION:

I guess my only point is, sure, I can

understand circumstances, textual circumstances in which

it would make perfect sense for us to explain wilfully

9

The tough thing for me here is, that sounds like
a shorthand for knowingly in a statute that uses

10

knowingly, and if we've got to make the distinction, it

11

does not seem to me that that is a legitimate distinction,

12

is a legitimate definition for wilfully when we've got the

13

two of them together in the same statute.

14

MR. JONES:

Well, what this Court's cases have

15

explained to me in reading them is that the Court has

16

distinguished between a knowing violation in cases like

17

Staples and Freed, which is simply proceeding with

18

knowledge of the facts that constitute the violation, and

19

a wilful violation in cases like Murdock and Screws and

20

Thurston, which is knowledge of the facts plus action with

21

taking those acts with the bad purpose to disobey or

22

disregard the law.

23

There is an additional requirement to wilfulness

Mr. Jones, I'm not sure Ratzlaf is an

QUESTION:

That'S
-- evaded the reporting requirement,

7

but the --my understanding of the facts was that the

defendant in that case didn't even know that it was

9

unlawful to structure the transaction.

He knew about the

10

reporting requirement, but he didn't know that evading the

11

reporting requirement was prohibited by a criminal

12

statute, so even that case, it seems to me, fits your

13

general category.

14

MR. JONES:

Yes.

The peculiarity of the statute

15

in Ratzlaf was that the statute contained as part of its

16

substantive element this additional bad purpose to disobey

17

or disregard the law that was the -- that is the component

18

of wilfulness, and since the statute contained both

19

wilful, and then this language about, for the purpose of

20

evading the law, what the Court said in Ratzlaf was, we

21

have to give wilfully in that statute a special meaning,

or it will be surplusage.

MR. JONES:

He has a duty to preserve the

MR. JONES:

At the trial court he should object

Now, what he did was, certainly what the record

in this Court and the court of appeals reflects is that he

asked for an additional instruction, which was denied, and

it was denial -- the denial of that instruction that has

been the focus of this case.

Mr. Jones, he did object on page 18

of the joint appendix -- he objected, but he gave as the

reason for it the failure to require specific knowledge of

5

the license.

6

this objection is a little different than --

7

Now, the question whether that preserves

MR. JONES:

If it hypothetically preserved the

8

objection at that point, it has been waived by not raising

9

it in the court of appeals or in this Court.

10

Now, is the instruction adequate to accomplish

11

what the Government thinks that it should have done, and

12

the answer to that is, as the Court knows, you have to

13

look to the context of the entire instruction.

14

And that rule is especially applicable here,

15

because the language that now defendant objects to is both

16

preceded and followed by language that directs the jury to

17

determine that this particular defendant acted with the

18

bad purpose to disobey or disregard the law.

And it's also accompanied by an instruction that

says, which we think is clearly correct, that the

reflect that courts had understood this term to talk about

added the word wilfully in 1986 to section 924.

4

All I want to say about that argument is that

5

the cases that they cite don't support it.

6

principal appellate authority that they cite, the Stein's,

purpose to disobey or disregard the law, and cites

In fact, the

appellate authority of its own circuit, which in turn

cites this Court's opinion in Murdock.

MR. JONES:

Justice Scalia, that's the point I

was addressing earlier about the Court's opinion in the

International Minerals case, that the right way to read

this statute is that it -- that what has -- what Congress

has proscribed is a wilful, in this case dealing in

firearms without a license, because what the statute says

is, wilfully violate any other provision of this chapter.
And what Congress -- I mean, what this Court

said in International Minerals that phrasing means is that

that knowingly violate is just a shorthand way of saying,

No, but the question was, does he
