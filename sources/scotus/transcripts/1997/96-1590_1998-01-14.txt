ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
GENERAL WAXMAN:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In holding that the American Israel Public

11
12

Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, was a political committee

13

within the meaning of the Federal Election Campaign Act,

14

the court of appeals misinterpreted this Court's

15

decisions, and it did so in a case it should not have

16

reviewed on the merits, for the respondents do not have

17

standing.

18

AIPAC is an association engaged in issue

19

advocacy and lobbying.

20

filed by individuals who disagree with AIPAC's policies,

21

and the FEC concluded that AIPAC had, quote, likely made

22

in-kind contributions aggregating over $1,000 in a

23

calendar year.

24
25

The FEC investigated a complaint

The commission then considered whether thereby
AIPAC was a political committee under the act, in which

case it would be required to disclose all receipts and

2

disbursements over $200, whether or not they were related

3

in any way to a campaign, and it would be limited in how

4

much money it could receive, and from whom.

5

The commission, interpreting the statute in

6

light of this Court's decisions in Buckley and

7

Massachusetts Citizens for Life, concluded that, because

8

campaign-related activity was not a major purpose of

9

AIPAC, its incidental campaign spending did not require it

10

to comply with the act's restrictions on political

11

committees.

12

In concluding that the FEC acted, quote,

13

contrary to law, the court of appeals erred in two ways.

14

Let me just say a few words about the merits and then

15

address the standing issues.

16

In Massachusetts Citizens for Life, this Court

17

deemed it, quote, undisputed that an organization making

18

nearly $10,000 in campaign-related spending was not a

19

political committee because its major purpose was issue

20

advocacy, not election activity.

21

In so holding, this Court relied on its earlier

22

conclusion in Buckley that, quote, to fulfill the purposes

23

of the FECA, the term political committee need only

24

encompass organizations that under -- that are under the

25

control of a candidate, or the major purpose of which is

QUESTION:

2

General Waxman, I -- you're

3

addressing the merits, and do you mind if I raise a

preliminary question before we really wade into the merits

5

of the major purpose test?
GENERAL WAXMAN:

6

7

0'Connor.
QUESTION:

8

9

I'd be grateful, Justice

Has the FEC changed its notion of who

are members within the meaning of the statute so that the

10

expenditures that were made here might be ones that were

11

for publications that went to members, in which case the

12

statute wouldn't be involved at all?

13

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Justice O'Connor, a great deal

14

has happened with respect to the membership issue and the

15

law relating to who consti -- what -- who is or is not a

16

member since the FEC made its decision in this case, and

17

let me --

18

QUESTION:

Under the FEC's current

19

interpretation and application of who's a member, would

20

the mailings here have gone to members?

21

GENERAL WAXMAN:

The FEC has recently within the

22

last 3 weeks issued a proposed -- a.notice of proposed

23

regulation in which it has set out for public notice and

24

comment an alternative set of definitions of membership,

25

and what constitutes a member, and under one of the

1

alternative definitions that the FEC is proposing, the

2

AIPAC members, insofar as the record existed in this case

3

at the time, would not qualify as members, but as --

4
5
6

QUESTION:

In that case the statute wouldn't be

invoked at all, if that were -GENERAL WAXMAN:

Well, no, what -- I guess what

7

I -- what I meant to say is, the FEC has not yet settled

8

on a firm definition of membership.

decision in this case, but that regulation was struck down

It did after the

10

by the court of appeals in a case that it decided a few

11

years after the FEC made a decision in this case.

12

response, the FEC --

13

QUESTION:

In

Well, in that case I thought that

14

the -- I thought that the Chamber of Commerce case

15

intervened between the three-judge panel in this case and

16

the en banc in this case, is that not --

17

GENERAL WAXMAN:

18

QUESTION:

That is correct, and --

So at the time you were arguing

19

political committee at the en banc, the D.C. Circuit had

20

already decided the membership question in the Chamber of

21

Commerce case, and to me it was just a total mystery how

22

come these two never met from the same court.

23

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Well, I -- I agree that it is,

24

like many other things in this case, somewhat mysterious,

25

but I think what the en banc court of appeals concluded,

1

and I think correctly, is that for purposes of deciding

2

this case, the FEC's determination was that the people

3

that AIPAC considered members were not, in fact, members,

4

and that the FEC is now in the process of determining --

5

of fixing on a definition of membership which it has not

6

yet done, but still takes the position that membership can

7

be defined in a way to exclude all people who pay $50 a

8

year in dues to AIPAC.

9

QUESTION:

But wasn't AIPAC itself always taking

10

the position that it was a membership organization

11

communicating with its members?

12

GENERAL WAXMAN:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

I mean, it was not --

Oh --

It was not in this litigation.

It

was - GENERAL WAXMAN:

Absolutely AIPAC took that

16

position, and in fact the joint -- the general counsel's

17

brief and report that are reprinted in the joint appendix

18

devote a very substantial portion of time addressing

19

AIPAC's contention that these papers -- these people were

20

just its members, and therefore these weren't expenditures

21

or contributions in any regard.

22

23

The commission concluded otherwise, and the
commission is now propounding a rule which, if adopted --

24

QUESTION:

General Waxman, isn't it --

25

GENERAL WAXMAN:

-- would permit them to adhere

1

to that insofar as AIPAC still has the same rules with

2

respect to membership as it did at the time.

3

QUESTION:

But isn't it true that,

if they

4

follow the definition of membership that the D.C. Circuit

5

has followed in the case Justice Ginsburg referred to,

6

then these people would be members?

7

GENERAL WAXMAN:

8

Well,

I don't -- I don't think

that the --my problem with answering the question,
Justice Stevens,

is that the D.C. Circuit did not apply,

10

as we understand it,

a rule with respect to who was a

11

member.

12

commission's prior rule, which required, as a bright line

13

test,

14

matter how affirmatively they tried to be a member --

The D.C. Circuit simply struck down the

that no matter how many dues anybody paid, and no

15

QUESTION:

They had to vote.

16

GENERAL WAXMAN:

-- there was a bright line

17

requirement that you had to be able to vote for at least

18

one member of the governing body.

the ratio decidendi of the commission in this particular

20

case, and that was struck down.

21

That was,

But in Chamber of Commerce,

in many ways,

the D.C. Circuit

22

left open the possibility that an organization like AIPAC,

23

which requires only $50 to establish oneself as a member,

24

might properly be deemed to be not a member by the FEC,

25

and in fact in the petition for -- in its -- in its

opinion denying rehearing in Chamber of Commerce the court

2

of appeals emphasized that it is open, still open to the

3

commission to define membership in a way -- I mean, it

4

wasn't addressing this particular case, but to define

5

membership in a way that would or wouldn't include AIPAC

members.

QUESTION:

GENERAL WAXMAN:

QUESTION:

Well, so jurisprudentially, what do

we do, faced with this question, or uncertainty?

GENERAL WAXMAN:

QUESTION:

14

Particularly tricky here is

that --

10
11

So --

Well, we --

Is there some way we can safely reach

the merits, and if so, how?

15

GENERAL WAXMAN:

I think you can and should

reach the merits.

No one in this case, even AIPAC in

response to the disposition at the administrative level,

has challenged the membership issue.

It's not been

It's a fact-sensitive question, and it may very

well be true, Justice O'Connor, that if the court of

appeals opinion is sustained, or you otherwise dispose of

GENERAL WAXMAN:

We think that this --we think

that this, that the lower courts should not have reached

24

have either Article III or statutory standing, but if you

1

interpretation of this Court's opinions in Buckley and

2

Massachusetts Citizens for Life is, quote, sufficiently

3

reasonable to -- to uphold it.

4

The one thing that --

5

QUESTION:

General Waxman, just -- I don't

6

understand.

First you're saying, don't reach the merits

7

because there's a standing hurdle, but if you should find

8

there's no standing hurdle, skip over another possible

9

hurdles -- this is my concern.
This question, political question, is not easy,

10
11

and it could be a really important thing to a lot of

12

organizations that just have mailing lists, that don't

13

have dues-paying members.

14

question in a case where it may well be that this

15

particular organization qualifies as a membership

16

organization, so the question is really academic for

17

AIPAC?

18

Why should we decide that

Why shouldn't we hold off on such a question

19

until we're sure we have the kind of entity that would be

20

affected by it?

21

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Well, it is, of course, open to

QUESTION:

Send it back.

2

GENERAL WAXMAN:

-- hold that there was not --

3

vacate the court of appeals decision and send it back.

4

What is intolerable --

5

QUESTION:

I don't see why we have that choice,

6

because the membership issue as such is not what has come

7

to us.

8

9
10

GENERAL WAXMAN:

The membership issue certainly

is not one that has come to you.
QUESTION:

What --

It seems to me the only thing we

11

could do, if we are going to advert to that issue at all,

12

is to say, it is in a state of ferment, and the one thing

13

that seems clear is that there is going to be a

14

redetermination, whatever the result may be, of what

15

membership means at the commission level, and we ought to

16

send this case back so that -- so that if it ultimately

17

comes to us it will come to us on a concept of membership,

18

which is -- which for the foreseeable future will be the

19

permanent one and will give us a good reason to go the

20

length of the adjudication that you want.

21

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Well, I do acknowledge that

22

there is some appeal to that approach, but I would just

23

ask the Court to look at this from the perspective of the

24

commission.

25

The commission is now in the position of having

been told by the en banc court of appeals that virtually

2

any voter in the country can haul it into court whenever

3

it makes a determination that a group, whether it's a

4

civic or religious, or my family, or any other group has

5

made more than $1,000 in political spending, and therefore

6

is required to file with the courts as a political

7

committee, and -- so in other words, that -- virtually any

8

voter can bring the FEC into court, because that's the

9

standing rule they've applied, and that this -- that the

10

commission's efforts to apply the major purpose test that

11

this Court enunciated is wrong, and in fact any group,

12

incorporated or otherwise, that makes more than $1,000 of

13

what the commission would deem to be in-kind, coordinated

14

or independent expenditures is a political --

15

QUESTION:

16

GENERAL WAXMAN:

17
18

So you say in just -We're in an impossible

position.
QUESTION:

And you say in deciding those

19

questions we wouldn't have to express any definitive view

20

on the membership question.

21

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Absolutely right.

It is a

22

question -- for purposes of the law of the case, there has

23

been a determination by the commission in this case that

24

AIPAC's, the people that AIPAC was communicating with were

25

not members.

1

If we are wrong and, in fact, the major purpose

2

test doesn't apply, on remand the FEC will have to

3

consider and take AIPAC's views whether or not, in light

4

of the court of appeals decision in Chamber of Commerce

5

AIPAC's members are, in fact members under the act.

6

a very tricky --

7

QUESTION:

It is

General Waxman, I understand your

8

anxiety about standing, and that sounds perfectly

9

sensible, but I -- what I don't understand is why you

10

don't have a second step and say, if you should decide

11

standing, then send it back to the commission.

12

The commission doesn't know yet what its

13

membership thing is, but when it gets its act together

14

this case may well be moot as far as a political committee

15

is concerned, so I certainly understand why you want to

16

urge standing first.

17

What I don't understand is why you're not

18

telling us, but if we're wrong about standing, this case

19

should not be -- the ultimate question in this case should

20

not be reached because it might fold at the commission

21

level on what Justice O'Connor said at the very first is a

22

threshold question, a preliminary question.

23

GENERAL WAXMAN:

I guess the reason is that if

24

you hold -- if you conclude that there's no standing in

25

this case, the decision in the court below is vacated and,

in fact, the commission is back on its own.
QUESTION:

understand --

GENERAL WAXMAN:

QUESTION:

6

GENERAL WAXMAN:

But if you don't --

-- is the political committee -If you don't, we are left with

7

a decision on the merits of a critically important issue

8

of law, which is, are groups that are organized for any

9

number of hundreds of different reasons political

10
11

committees?
QUESTION:

But the thing would be vacated,

12

because the -- just as we would not reach political

13

committee, neither should the D.C. Circuit, so I'm still

14

puzzled why you don't say, standing is our first argument,

15

but if we lose on that, vacate the district court's -- the

16

D.C. Circuit's decision, send it --.have them send it back

17

to the commission so the membership issue can be

18

determined.

19

GENERAL WAXMAN:

The FEC is in an extremely

20

unusual posture in this case vis-a-vis the substantive law

21

of the Federal Election Commission Act, mainly because in

22

this dance with Congress and the Supreme Court the FEC is

23

very much following -- we're -- the commission is trying

very hard to determine --

with all these alternatives, we're going to have to decide

GENERAL WAXMAN:

.

We think --we believe that the

18

Court erred in holding that respondents held standing in

19

this case, either under the statute or the Constitution,

20

to challenge the commission's decision.

21

In cases like Heckler v. Chaney and Linda R. S.

22

v. Richard D., this Court has reiterated a fundamental

23

background principle that ordinarily complaints that an

24

agency has failed to take enforcement action are not

subject to judicial review, but under the court of

appeals' interpretation, as I said, it's now open to

2

almost any voter to bring the FEC into court whenever it

decides not to file an enforcement action against a

religious, civic, issue advocacy, or any other group that

5

Did these plaintiffs comply with all

the district court against the Federal Election Commission

under these provisions.

22

demonstrates why there is so little standing in this case

If Congress, instead of using the

GENERAL WAXMAN:

think that even if the Court were to construe this review

of Article III, as in Trafficante and Hardin and cases

like that, there still would be no constitutional standing

here because they haven't demonstrated injury in fact.

GENERAL WAXMAN:

So the simple fact that

everybody is affected doesn't always show they don't have

standing.

7

GENERAL WAXMAN:

I -- it -- it certainly does

8

not always show they don't have standing, but I think it's

9

instructive to compare this statute or their claim of

10

standing here with a claim of standing under the FOIA, for

11

example.
FOIA provides a personal right in an individual

12

13

to ask the Government, to have -that individual ask the

14

Government for information, and if the Government doesn't

15

provide that person information, that person is injured

16

within the meaning of the statute and can bring a lawsuit,

and there's no issue of redressability, because if the

Court agrees with the individual he gets the document that

exists.

The Federal Election Campaign Act doesn't create

rights in particular individuals to get particular

But the public, each member of the

statutorily provided interest in getting information

sufficient on that first point?

12

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Because I don't think -- and we

13

do think that the stronger argument, the clearer argument

14

against Article III standing is redressability both

15

because of the discretionary nature of the decision, the

16

particular aft powers and lack thereof of the commission,

acknowledged that there would not be sufficient

necessary to prevent this statute from being applied to

many, many entities and transactions that were far from

9

MR. SCHEMBER:

No, Your Honor.

What we're

dealing with is a dual purpose organization.

The test is

10

not necessary to protect dual purpose organizations from

11

having their noncampaign-related activities disclosed.

12

Dual purpose organizations can avoid that kind

13

of disclosure through the simple expedient of setting up a

14

separate organization or a special segregated fund.

15

Section 441b(b) expressly provides for that contingency,

16

and then section 431 says that, well, when a corporation

17

has set up a special segregated fund for purposes of

campaign activity, only the activities of the special

19

segregated fund constitute a political committee, and only

20

those activities are subject to disclosure.

QUESTION:

know, for all kinds of other things that really had

7

nothing to do with that particular letter that somebody

8

thought was a nice idea to send.

9

MR. SCHEMBER:

Well, two points about that.

10

First of all, it sounds to me like the organization that

11

you're describing would be -- may likely be

12

constitutionally exempt under the Massachusetts Citizens

13

for Life exemption.

14

Now, if you've got a small issue advocacy

15

organization that only makes an occasional independent

16

expenditure and that would be burdened by the

17

administrative requirements of setting up a special

18

segregated fund, then clearly under MCFL they're entitled

19

to a constitutional exemption.

20

They have that safeguard.

AIPAC's not that kind of an organization, a

21

large, sophisticated organization, able to meet many

22

administrative requirements.

23

QUESTION:

They haven't claimed that --

certainly there is enforcement discretion that the FEC

disposition of that case.

What we have here with respect to AIPAC is years

14

15

contributions to candidates, and the public needs to know

which current officeholders were the recipients of AIPAC

But your hypothetical, might be one that could
