ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL K. KELLOGG

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. KELLOGG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Congress passed the multidistrict litigation

11
12

statute in 1968 as an experiment for a limited purpose.

13

It wanted to allow cases with common facts filed around

14

the country to be consolidated in a single district for

15

coordinated pretrial proceedings.

16

pretrial proceedings promote judicial efficiency as well

17

as the efficiency of the parties by allowing for single

18

rounds of discovery and single rounds of document

19

requests.

Such coordinated

But Congress was quite specific that at the

20
21

conclusion of those coordinated pretrial proceedings the

22

case must be remanded to the original district.

23

here from section 1407(a), which is set forth at page 2 of

24

our brief.

25

by the panel at or before the conclusion of such pretrial

proceedings, unless it shall have been previously

2

terminated.

QUESTION:

Well, there is a line you omitted, is

4

there -- it doesn't say by the -- from the district to

5

which it was transferred, or --

6

MR. KELLOGG:

That is section 1404(a), which is

7

the general transfer statute, pursuant to which the

8

District of Arizona transferred this case to itself.

9

case originated in the Northern District of Illinois.

10

was transferred pursuant to 1407(a) for coordinated

11

pretrial proceedings in the District of Arizona.
QUESTION:

Now, Mr. Kellogg, under your theory

when should this -- your suit have been remanded?

14

MR. KELLOGG:

It should have been remanded at

15

the time specified in the statute, which is at or before

16

the conclusion of such pretrial proceedings.

17

QUESTION:

Well, was that when the Lincoln

18

Savings litigation ended, when the consolidated

19

proceedings ended, after summary judgment was entered,

20

when?

I don't know --

MR. KELLOGG:

QUESTION:

MR. KELLOGG:

The appropriate time --

-- when under your theory -The appropriate time in this case

is at the time that Lexicon made its motion to remand,

because the various factors cited -4

QUESTION:

1

2

And what had happened at that time?

I mean, which of these events had already occurred?

3

MR. KELLOGG:

Well, the multidistrict panel

4

cited three factors as reasons for sending this case to

7

depository in Arizona, and the third was the fact that

8

there was an unfinished settlement in the Lincoln Savings

9

litigation.

One was the pendency of the potentially related
The second was the existence of a document

10

Each of those three factors had been eliminated.

11

The appeal had been dismissed, the document depository had

12

been shut down, and Lincoln Savings had final judgment --

summary judgment in your case.
MR. KELLOGG:

That is correct.

At the time we

made our motion --

QUESTION:

Now, maybe --

18

MR. KELLOGG:

19

QUESTION:

--no determination had been made.

Maybe the district court, pursuant to

20

that original transfer, could go ahead and decide that,

21

could it not?
MR. KELLOGG:

22

Not pursuant to the statute, Your

23

Honor.

The statute specifically states that at or before

24

the conclusion of a consolidated pretrial proceeding the

25

case must be remanded, and we made our motion at that -5

So when the consolidated proceedings

had ended you say it had to go back.

MR. KELLOGG:

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And, in fact, it did not, and a jury

trial was held, and it was -- the jury determined that

MR. KELLOGG:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

That's correct.

And at that point, what's the remedy?

Why shouldn't we just leave things be?

Even if you read

it right, why should we upset that now?
MR. KELLOGG:

11

Well, because venue is like

12

subject matter jurisdiction in the sense that if it is not

13

waived the case must be reversed afterwards.

Justice Ginsburg, even though respondents argued that we

could have filed the case in the District of Arizona, but

3

the fact remains, we did not file the case in the District

of Arizona.

file this case in the Northern District of Chicago.

Exercising a long-held right, we decided to

Illinois.

7

MR. KELLOGG:

At the time it was transferred to

8

the Northern District -- to Arizona, it was transferred

9

only for coordinated and consolidated pretrial proceedings

10

pursuant to

11

conclusion of those proceedings the case must be remanded.

12

That means venue was improper in the District of Arizona.

QUESTION:

May I go back over your initial

answer to Justice O'Connor about summary judgment.

5

understand you right to say, not in this case but as a

6

general matter, summary judgment is a pretrial thing, so

7

it could be had, where I think your position is that the

multidistrict forum has no authority ever to grant

That's correct.

So summary judgment sometimes,

MR. KELLOGG:

Summary judgment in appropriate

24

circumstances could be granted by the transferee court.

In the appropriate circumstances

where it's part of coordinated, consolidated pretrial -QUESTION:

You mean if every single case

involves the same summary judgment motion?
MR. KELLOGG:

Right.

For example, if there's a

10

common issue of law that spans across all the cases, or a

11

common issue of fact, the court might well, pursuant to

12

coordinated and consolidated pretrial proceedings, grant

13

summary judgment.

14

QUESTION:

So you're saying consolidated means

15

that which is common to all, rather than referring to

16

simply a collection of cases which are consolidated for

17

whatever pretrial proceedings there might be involving

18

common issues?

1

MR. KELLOGG:

The statute says consolidated and

20

coordinated, so the cases are brought together.

21

consolidated, but the idea is to connect coordinated

22

pretrial proceedings, and the statute's absolutely

23

explicit that at the conclusion of those proceedings the

case has to go back.

We're

The key point for our case is that

there is a durational limitation built into 1407(a).

It

says that the transferee court gets the case for a limited

11

period of time to conduct coordinated or consolidated

12

pretrial proceedings.

13

specific proceedings that cover all those various cases,

14

that span across the cases, but the key point for this

15

case is that there's a durational limitation.

Now, in my view, that means it's

No one disputes that at the time Lexecon made

16
17

its motion to remand there was no prospect of any future

18

coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings in this

case.

20

case has to be remanded.

The statute therefore is quite explicit that the

Mr. Kellogg, do you agree that under

proper?

I agree that the JPML rule --

1

MR. KELLOGG:

2

QUESTION:

3

allows for it.

What

But you say, though, the rule is

unauthorized.

4

MR. KELLOGG:

The rule is directly contrary to

5

the statute.

6

with a single specific exception -- it says, the case

7

shall be remanded unless it has been previously

8

terminated, and what the JPML has done is said, well, it

9

has to be remanded unless it's been terminated or unless

What the JPML has done is taken a statute

10

the district court has transferred the case to itself

11

pursuant to 1404(a).
So they've read a second exception into the

12

13

statute that completely swallows the rule, because

14

essentially what they've done is says, the case has to be

15

remanded unless the district court decides not to remand

16

it.

17

QUESTION:

Well, the district court is -- does

18

not have total freedom in its options even under the rule,

19

but it can assign it to itself, I guess, because it's not

20

the transferee court.

21

MR. KELLOGG:

The transferee court, in this case

22

the District of Arizona, was not free to assign the case

23

to itself, for two reasons.

Under the rule it is, but the rule

is invalid.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. KELLOGG:

Oh.
And that's for two reasons.

First

4

it makes nonsense of the shall-be-remanded language,

5

second,

6

because 1404 specifies that a case may be transferred to

7

any other district court.

8
9
10

and

the invocation of 1404 was itself improper,

QUESTION:

Yes, but your opponent say other --

when they're referring to other district courts the base
of reference is the Northern District of Illinois.

11

MR. KELLOGG:

Well,

if you read the language

12

closely,

13

specifically,

14

in the interests of justice a district court may transfer

15

any civil action to any other district or division where

16

it might have been brought.

17

and it's set out at page 2 of our brief,

Now,

it says

for the convenience of parties and witnesses

the only way to make sense of that language

18

is that the district court that does the transferring,

19

subject of the sentence,

20

receives the case, the other district which is the

21

indirect object of that sentence.

22

No,

it doesn't have to be district.

MR. KELLOGG:

I believe that's correct.

sure I followed the import of that.
Under

404 a self-transfer is in our view

oxymoronic, because no transfer is taking place.

MR. KELLOGG:

That's correct, Justice Scalia.

There's a built-in safeguard there.
QUESTION:

Well, why -- I don't know that I

24

quite follow that.

Why is a judge who doesn't transfer

25

necessarily less worthy than a judge who does transfer?

MR. KELLOGG:

1

It's only a question that, under

2

the strict language of 1404 the transfer has to be to some

3

other district.

4

A court who merely asserts jurisdiction over the

5

course -- case and says, I'm going to keep it for all

6

purposes, is not transferring the case within the meaning

7

of 1404, and there's no reason to distort the language of

8

1404, which was passed in 1947 at a time when the prospect

9

of self-transferring did not even exist, because the

10

multidistrict litigation statute was not passed until

11

1968, in which case a court for the first time could get a

12

case for limited purposes, but expressly has to remand

13

that at the conclusion of those purposes and cannot

14

bootstrap that authority by holding onto a case -QUESTION:

15

Mr. Kellogg, I want to bring you back

16

to the possible remedy, because even if I were to agree

17

with you on your reading of the statutes, I'm not sure

18

that you're entitled to have the jury verdict set aside

19

now.
MR. KELLOGG:

20

Well, first of all, let me point

21

out that we sought mandamus before the trial in the Ninth

22

Circuit.

23

we were not entitled to mandamus because we had a complete

24

remedy on appeal, and the Ninth Circuit agreed with that

25

position.

Respondents specifically took the position that

QUESTION:

Mr. Kellogg, I think you answered in

11

response to my question earlier that 1404(a) is not

12

available at all to this multidistrict forum, not to

13

itself and not to another forum.

14

MR. KELLOGG:

No, but it is available to the

original court when the case is filed, so it was

do you think is right on point?

case for two reasons, first of all because respondents

2

tried so hard to get this case to the District of Arizona

3

because of popular prejudice and strong feelings about the

4

Lincoln Savings matter and Charles Keating in particular,

5

and were relying on the fact that anyone associated with,

6

or alleged to be associated with Charles Keating was

7

essentially going to get lynched by a jury in Arizona, and

8

as Judge Kozinski said, they peppered their trial

9

arguments with references to Keating's misdeeds and with

10
11

references to the Lincoln Savings debacle.
A second reason is that Judge Zagel, to whom

12

this case had been assigned in the Northern District of

13

Illinois, had specifically rejected their argument that

14

Judge Bilby's orders in the Lincoln Savings case somehow

15

had a preclusive effect on parts of this litigation.

16

When the case was transferred to Arizona, Judge

17

Bilby's colleague immediately gave preclusive effect to

18

Judge Zagel's ruling, so in this case there was

19

substantial prejudice.

another source of difference from the Caterpillar

in that instance because the chances of the defect being

QUESTION:

Is it correct that the -- I don't

That's correct.

If you had gotten your certification

that case says you have to use it, that word terminated in

a common sense way and give effect to the statute.

5

And by interpreting terminated to mean

terminated as an MDL proceeding, we give effect not only

7

to

8

mandatory language that the transferee judge shall conduct

9

pretrial proceedings -- shall conduct pretrial

407(a), but to

407(b), because

407(b) also says in

10

proceedings -- and if we want to know what Congress meant

11

we only have to look at what the Murrah Committee meant,

12

because as Professor Wright says in his amicus brief it's

3

fiction here to say what Congress meant, because this was

4

all engineered by the Murrah Committee in the judicial

5

conference.

6

Congress passed this statute with only two

7

changes suggested by the Department of Justice, one to

8

exempt Government antitrust cases from the statute, and

9

two, originally the Murrah Committee suggested that the

20

transferor court would have to consent to the transfer.

They took that out, so any proprietary interest of the

22

transferor court disappears.

of this act a case called In re Plumbing Fixtures, which

2

MR. SOLOVY:

It's no longer an MDL proceeding.

You see, Rule 14(b) of the MDL panel, the expert body that

4

administers this act, says if a motion to transfer is

granted either to some other court or to the transferee

The Pfizer, on which retired Justice Clark sat,

said you have to have the transferee judge rule upon

QUESTION:

Mr. Solovy, the main problem that I

13

have with using the motion to transfer as a lever to get

trial under a statute, 1407, that has pretrial written all

over it, the multidistrict panel transfers it to a

MR. SOLOVY:

The debate in Congress, if there

they issued

2

404 orders.

The question was whether the panel could have

3

the supertransfer power not only for pretrial but for

4

trial, because remember, the panel can ship the case to a

5

court without jurisdiction and a court without venue.

6

That's entirely different than a

7

debate was never, could the transferee court transfer

cases, because the Murrah Committee knew they had done so

in the electrical equipment cases.

where does the district court get the legal power to

transfer a case to himself for trial?

7

It doesn't seem to come out of

407 for the

8

reason -- in addition to what you say to me it's very

9

important -- that the judicial conference drafted the bill

20

and wrote to conference, wrote to Congress, right in the

report the letter from the judges, at or before the

completion of the pretrial proceedings the panel would

And then they

Well, in the absence of 1407 I become concerned

12

about the language, which does say, other court -- it says

13

a district court may transfer a civil action to any other

14

district, and I don't know how that language in the

way?

2

MR. SOLOVY:

Justice Breyer, if you'll allow me

3

to defer for a second to Justice Ginsburg's question, what

4

they said was, not only 1407(a) but 1407(b), which

5

mandates that the transferee judge shall conduct pretrial

6

proceedings, in the Plumbing Fixture case there's a sort

7

of a ironic heading which says that construction of the

8

plain meaning of section 1407, which they thought was

9

plain then, and they said that the language of 1407(b) is

10

mandatory, and number 2, it says that in transfer

11

statutes, whether it's 1404(a) or 1407, the transferee

12

judge can issue any order, make any judgment, do anything

13

that the transferor judge could do.

You have sort of, in property sense, a livery of
Caesar.

QUESTION:

Well, but I wonder how much that

Pfizer says, if you don't have the transferee judge have

they are trying to overcome in the electrical equipment

QUESTION:

I took it that your argument was

basically something like this, that the -- an Illinois

judge under 1404(a) could always transfer to Arizona.

10

MR. SOLOVY:

11

QUESTION:

Correct.
All right.

Now, what 1407 does is,

12

it says for purposes of the pretrial proceedings, Arizona

13

judge, you stand in the shoes of the Illinois judge.

14

MR. SOLOVY:

QUESTION:

Justice Breyer -All right.

Now, what I was looking

for in support for that argument is, is there something in

the Koehring case, which we also cite in our brief, this

Now, is it your contention that venue is not

district Z can take the case if the court in district Z

takes the case?

doesn't matter whether district A transferred it or not,

venue is proper, just because the defendant runs over

Very seldom, Justice Scalia, and

He transferred the case for trial to himself in Tucson.

It made a lot of sense to try that case there.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL K. KELLOGG

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

3

MR. KELLOGG:

Are you going to respond to Mr.

4

Solovy's last point, that you never went back to the

5

panel?

6
7

MR. KELLOGG:

I'll respond to that

directly.

8

9

Yes.

We did exactly what the panel's rules require,
which is to go in the first instance to the district

10

court, the transferee court, and ask for a suggestion of

11

remand.
When the district court denied that motion, it

12

13

simultaneously transferred the case to itself, which under

14

the JPML rules deprived the panel of any further

15

jurisdiction over the case, so we had no choice at that

16

point but to seek mandamus in the Ninth Circuit, which we

17

did.

18

Respondents of course at that point argued to

19

the Ninth Circuit mandamus is inappropriate because they

20

have a complete remedy on appeal.

21

accepted that argument and that's why we're here today.

22

QUESTION:

Can I ask you this, on that

particular point:

question of whether a 1404 error, a 1404(a) error is

2

reviewable despite the fact that there was a trial.

3

If you're right on that, and it is reviewable

4

after trial, does that mean there'd always be the argument

5

after a fair trial this was not a jurisdiction where it

6

was convenient for the witnesses?

therefore we will have review in the courts of appeals and

9

set aside trials because of a 1404(a) violation on the

This was not a

10

ground, abuse of discretion in respect to.

11

what's bothering me?
MR. KELLOGG:

12

13

Do you see

Yes, exactly, but we're not

dealing here with an abuse of discretion action.

14

QUESTION:

No, but if you win, don't we also

15

have to say that the trial doesn't cure an abuse of

16

discretion in a transfer in respect to convenience of

17

witnesses?

18

MR. KELLOGG:

I don't think you do.

First of

19

all, we're asking you to vindicate the mandate of 1407 in

20

the first instance, which is absolutely clear, and says

21

the case shall be remanded.

22

Second, even under 1404 we're not talking about

23

a discretionary balancing of factors.

We're talking about

24

a direct violation of the statute.

court stands in the shoes of the Illinois court, but it's

2

really a distortion of the statutory language to say that

the court is both the self and the other within the scope

of that single sentence, and there's no reason to distort

that language in order to reach a result that Congress

6

clearly did not intend --

QUESTION:

May I ask if you would take the same

position if the transfer had been to a different district?

9

MR. KELLOGG:

Well, then we would not rely on

1404, but our position would be exactly the same under

Now, I'd like to go back to the issue of remedy,

Justice O'Connor, because I think it's quite critical.

2

that's why they require you to go to him in the first

instance, because he's the one who's going to know.

4

But this case is an easy one, because there's no

5

dispute that any prospect of coordinated and consolidated

pretrial proceedings had ended at that point, so the case

7

had to be remanded as of the date that Lexecon made its

motion, because that is the triggering event.

where it's not waived the statute is absolutely clear, and
