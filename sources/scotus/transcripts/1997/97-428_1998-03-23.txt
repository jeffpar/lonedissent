ORAL ARGUMENT OF JERRY D. ANKER

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ANKER:

10

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

12

Section 211 of the Railway Labor Act permits

13

unions and employers to enter into what are you called

14

agency, shop, or similar forms of union security

15

agreements.

16

employees are not required to become union members, but

17

they are required to support the union financially through

18

the payment of the equivalent of union dues,

19

fees, and assessments.

20

Under an agency shop agreement,

However,

represented

initiation

in a line of cases stretching back now

21

more than 35 years,

22

not use such an agreement to require objecting nonmembers

23

to pay for union activities that are political and

24

ideological in nature or are otherwise unrelated to the

25

collective bargaining function.

this Court has said that a union may

In 1986, in Chicago Teacher's Union v. Hudson,

1

2

the Court went one step further and held that unions must

3

provide three procedural safeguards to ensure that

4

objectors' funds will not be spent improperly, and those

5

safeguards are, first a notice containing an adequate

6

explanation of how the fee is calculated, second, a

7

reasonably prompt opportunity to challenge the fee before

8

an impartial decisionmaker, and third, an escrow for the

9

amounts reasonably in dispute while those challenges are

10

pending.

11

The issue in this case is whether employees who

12

wish to challenge the fee that they're being charged must

13

present their claim to that impartial decisionmaker before

14

bringing any kind of a lawsuit.

15

This case arose in November of 1991, when the

16

Airline Pilots Association, or ALPA, as we called it,

17

entered into an agency shop agreement with Delta Airlines,

18

very much like the agency shop agreements ALPA has with

19

most of the country's airlines.

20

Before the agreement even became effective, five

21

Delta pilots, later joined by about 150 intervenors, filed

22

a lawsuit to enjoin implementation of that agreement.

23

They had many grounds for their lawsuit, but for present

24

purposes the only one that's relevant here was the

25

allegation that ALPA does not, or does charge objectors

1

improperly for activities which are outside the scope of

2

collective bargaining.

3

Now, ALPA has written procedures in compliance

4

with the Hudson decision that include an impartial

5

decisionmaker for the purpose of resolving such disputes.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. ANKER:

8

QUESTION:

9

Mr. Anker -Yes.
-- would you mind telling me as a

practical matter how these fee challenges typically come

10

up?

Are they usually brought to challenge the amount of

11

past payments, or are they typically prospective in

12

nature?

How does the union notify people --

MR. ANKER:

MR. ANKER:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. ANKER:

You're talking about specifically --- of the breakdown?
-- in our case?
Yes.

Well, the typical situation.

All right.

I think, Your Honor, the

18

procedures vary from union to union.

19

ALPA is the following way.

20

The way it works in

The books are closed -- we're on an annual year

21

basis, so that the books are closed at the end of each

22

year and then there is a general audit of the books, and

23

in connection with that audit, or once that audit is

24

completed, then a statement is prepared and that statement

25

itself is also audited, setting forth the germane and

essentially our Hudson notice.

At that point, any --

MR. ANKER:

But then you -- it doesn't get

Let me - - if I can just finish, I

think I'll -- you'll see that part of it.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. ANKER:

Yes, okay.
The statement is issued.

At that

16

point, for the year in which it's issued, there is an

17

immediate but only provisional adjustment put into place.

18

Then when that year is finished there is a final

19

calculation and we actually either add charges or refund,

20

depending on what the differences are.

21

that the pilot has the right to challenge that

22

calculation.

23

It's at that point

Now, when he does that, of course, he's

24

challenging both the retrospective one and also the

25

provisional one for the coming year, but that's the way

our system works.

Other unions have a different system.

2

Other unions are always running 1 year behind, and they

3

don't go back and make the retroactive adjustment, which

4

we do.
QUESTION:

5

Have -- has this Court ever required

6

a nonsignatory to a contract to submit to arbitration

7

rather than going to court?
MR. ANKER:

It's kind of a big step to do.

I

12

MR. ANKER:

13

QUESTION:

Well, it's -- it may --- help as a practical matter, but I

14

just -- I wondered what kind of authority there would be

15

for that.

16

MR. ANKER:

All right.

I think that's the core

17

of this case, and I think to call it arbitration, which in

18

a sense it is, is also in another sense misleading,

19

because it is really not consensual arbitration, which is

20

what most arbitration is, although I gather there are

21

statutes -- one of the Article III cases cited by counsel

22

involves the FIFRA statute, which has a compulsory

23

arbitration.

24

that's not consensual.

25

I think ERISA has a compulsory arbitration

This is a - -

We

5

call it arbitration because it most resembles arbitration,

6

but what the Court called it in Hudson was an impartial

7

decisionmaker, and I think the vision that the Court had

is that these disputes should be decided by some form of

9

private process, arbitration-like process, or at least

10

they should be submitted to such a process before they go

11

to court.

Association created a procedure specifically for this

MR. ANKER:

In the year that this case arose,

3

which was 1992, the fees were 2.35 percent of their

airline earnings.

1.95, but in that year it was 2.35.

MR. ANKER:

QUESTION:

$2,350.
I see, so that a -- and then if you

14

reduce that, say 10 percent was in dispute, it would be a

15

couple of hundred dollars in dispute for each person.

16

MR. ANKER:

That's about right.

That's about

17

right, just -- for example, in this case the arbitrator

18

found that there were some items that had been improperly

19

allocated and should not have been charged, and we rebated

20

those, and it came to, I think, of the order -- this is

21

not in the record, but it's of the order of $55 on average

22

for the individuals that were involved in this case.

Justice O'Connor's question was, what

is the source of our authority to do this?

QUESTION:

6

8

Well -Where do I have the power, does this

Court have the power to do that?
MR. ANKER:

I guess I would answer it this way,

Your Honor.
We are dealing here -- all the statute says, as

9

I indicated, at the beginning, is that the union and the

10

employer has a right to have this kind of an agreement,

11

but the Court has found beneath the language of the

12

statute and sort of in the underlying legislative history

13

and the purpose of the statute, an intent by Congress that

14

fees be used only for certain purposes and not for others,

15

and based on the determination that there is such an

16

intention, that that's what Congress wanted, there is a

17

body of law which has had to be necessarily developed by

18

this Court.

19

It's not that different from the body of law

20

that has been developed surrounding the duty of fair

21

representation, or surrounding collective bargaining

22

agreements under section 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act.

QUESTION:

Well, my answer would be, Your

Honor, that that's exactly what the Court did in the

MR. ANKER:

The Court said that the union must

QUESTION:

It's not an option.

But that was under the Due Process

Clause, wasn't it?
You know, you go back to the Hanson case, where

12

13

the Court says, well now, the Government has its hand on

14

the scale here so there's some constitutional provisions

15

involved.

The

way we've resolved that, Your Honor, is to say that we

MR. ANKER:

QUESTION:

In practice, we do.
Mr. Anker, if I look at Hudson and

6

don't go any further than that, I at least find it

7

difficult to conclude that the provision for the neutral

8

decisionmaker was intended to be anything but a protection

9

for the dissidents.

It was their interests that were

10

getting litigated there, and the court mentioned the value

of a speedy determination.

All of that seems to take into

However, my question to you is going to be,

14

should we consider other interests in going beyond Hudson?

15

Should we consider, for example, the impracticality, if

16

that is true, of litigating every one of these issues

17

first and last in the Federal courts?

18

With that in mind, I would like to know what the

19

experience has been, if you can tell me, about what has

20

happened after there has been arbitration.

21

the arbitrated cases then simply been litigated de novo,

in Federal courts?

MR. ANKER:

Well, I have to say, Your Honor,

4

that my knowledge about that is fairly limited, but I

think the union that has the most experience with it is

brief as an amicus here, and they have informed the Court

in their brief that in - - I don't remember whether they

and this Court decides in Hudson that really the union can

go and spend what it wants as long as it gives them, a

dissenter a fair chance to see how much of that is being

spent on nongermane things, and it says you have to have

an escrow.

7

MR. ANKER:

QUESTION:

Correct.
You have to give them a list of what

the expenditures were, and you have to provide for a

10

decision by an independent decisionmaker.

11

that, you're free.

12

All right.

Go do what you want.
But then they say, well, how do we

challenge it, and I think what they're worried about is

that there will be imported into this area of the law the

whole law of arbitration which, of course, gives a

tremendous leg up to whatever the decision of the

17

arbitrator is.

others have, and I think that was a concern, and therefore

MR. ANKER:

22

Let me say first of all that we have never

24

is a standard of finality and almost no review at all in

the case of normal arbitration --we have never argued

1

that that standard would apply.
The argument we make in this case -- and by the

2

3

way, this issue is not before the Court, because the Court

4

did not grant certiorari with respect to this issue of the

5

standard of review, but what we argued in the lower courts

6

was that the fact-findings of the arbitrator should be

7

given some degree of deference, and those fact-findings

8

would normally be the bean-counting issues, as I would

9

describe them, exactly how much did the union spend on

10

this or that or the other activity.
QUESTION:

11

Well, under your theory that the

12

procedure has to be expeditious and efficient, what would

13

prevent a court from saying that the usual rules of

presumptive correctness should not be applied?

the standard of review as we had proposed it to the lower

courts, we would say that the legal issues, which really I

3

think are the key issues here, is, for example, in our

case the issue of the chargeability of our safety

6

That's an issue of law basically, and that would

7

be reviewable de novo, but the Court would have a package

8

in which the facts would be at least preliminarily

resolved, the issues would be defined, and the Court in

quite expeditious fashion but in effective fashion could

exercise its jurisdiction and define the rights of the

Very well, Mr. Anker.

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As is apparent from the briefs of ALPA and the

legal authority for forcing the nonmember pilots to use

Neither ALPA nor either of its amici cites a single case

16

in which this Court has required exhaustion where there

was not one of two things.

But isn't it also true that there was

no case that, before Hudson, that said there had to be an

4

Now, I mean, what's wrong with that?

5

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

What's wrong with that, Your

6

Honor, is that the individual employee has a cause of

7

action which has been given to him by Congress, and this

8

Court has never, never held that exhaustion is required

9

where there is not one of two situations, one, either an

10

agreement to arbitrate, or a statutory administrative

11

scheme involving deference to another branch of

12

Government, and that is not this case.

13

QUESTION:

This, I think -- and I'm curious

14

about your view of this, and that's why I was pushing

15

it -- is not classical arbitration.

16

they're prepared to give you the district judge who would

17

afterwards look at how this arbitrator decides the matter

18

and review everything de novo as to whether or not the

19

factual thing gives rise to a nongermane or germaneness.

20

Now, that begins to sound like Price,

I take it that

21

Waterhouse.

What the arbitrator is doing is deciding what

22

the facts were, and we give him such deference as is due,

23

the power to persuade but not the power to control,

something like that, and then the judge decides it de

Now, from the point of view - - not your

It doesn't really hurt your clients because they

they're better off than if we don't give it to them, and

And the typical dissident in

represented dissidents in many places, including the

14

for discovery, which is denied in this arbitration

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

I don't know the answer to that

2

question, Your Honor, but I can answer one question,

and

3

that is, if you look at the law review article by Mr.

4

Malin, who was -- one of his articles was cited by ALPA in

5

one of its amici.

6

I cite another one on the post Gilmer

7

arbitration, and Mr. Malin points out in that article that

8

the arbitrators have to receive recommendations from four

9

employers and four unions to get on the panel

10
11

to be

selected in these cases.
My clients have no say over whether it's AAA or

12

somebody else who picks the arbitrator and they have no

13

say in the selection of the so-called arbitrator.

QUESTION:

Mr. LeJeunesse, you're essentially

years after this Court's decision in Patsy saying that you

can't be required to exhaust a State administrative

17

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

That's correct, Justice

18

Stevens, and what the Court was doing there, as the Chief

19

Justice has suggested, was providing a shield for the

protection of employee rights, not giving the union a

The Court then said, there's no remedy provided

under the Railway Labor Act, which is the statute in this

case, for vindication of an employee's rights where he's

accusing the union of breach of the duty of fair

representation.

Later, in Vaca and Breininger the Court held

that employees have the right to take that cause of action

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

QUESTION:

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

Yes, Justice Stevens.

Yes.
And I'm talking here about the

pilots who have an attorney, who want to go to court to

get a judicial determination with an Article III judge in

a proceeding where they have the right to discovery, where

7

they can compel the production of witnesses, where the

8

proceeding is truly adversary and they can get that

judicial determination of their -- what we're talking

10

about here after all is Federal statutory and

11

constitutional rights.

It really is an extraordinary claim,

that you just come into the court and say, I think they

21

understand your position.

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

Justice Ginsburg, it's a truly

extraordinary statutory privilege that the unions have to

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JERRY D. ANKER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

'

Thank you, Mr. LaJeunesse.

MR. ANKER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I

think I have three quick points I would like to make.

11

First of all, there's been a lot of discussion

12

by Mr. LeJeunesse about the intent of the statute, and I

13

think it's clear to say that the statute simply sheds no

14

light whatsoever on the question that's before us, and

15

that's not unusual.

16

are not resolved by any statute, and certainly this one

17

doesn't have anything whatsoever to say on the subject.

Very often these exhaustion questions

18

Now, when the statute is silent, what this Court

19

has said - - and I think this is really the ultimate answer

20

to the questions that were asked of me earlier by Justice

21

Ginsburg and others, where does the authority come from to

22

require this exhaustion, this Court has said on several

23

different occasions that exhaustion of an administrative

24

remedy or an arbitration remedy, as in Hudson, as in

QUESTION:

But one was -- certainly Republic

Steel was consensual, was it not?
MR. ANKER:

Well, Your Honor, one could say that

5

on the facts of Republic Steel, but the interesting thing

6

about the case is, when you read it, that was not the

7

principal reliance of the Court at all.

8

about several different policy considerations.

QUESTION:

The Court spoke

Yes, but another -- it seems another

10

defect in your suggestion is that this is not a remedy.

The arbitration doesn't bind the union -- I mean, bind the

member in the slightest.

15

MR. ANKER:

He -- it may change the

Well, I agree it doesn't bind him,

Your Honor - -

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. ANKER:

Which most remedies do.
It's maybe just simply a semantic

18

issue between us, but it's a remedy in the sense that it's

19

a way in which he might get what he's looking for.

20

might get the adjudication of the issue in his favor, and

21

that would resolve the problem for him, or her, and that's

22

why I would consider it a remedy.

23

But if the Court doesn't like that word, I think

24

it's still analogous to a remedy in a typical exhaustion

25

case such that the normal judicial discretion would apply.
