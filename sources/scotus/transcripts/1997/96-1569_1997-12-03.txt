ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES ROTHFELD

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. ROTHFELD:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
I have two principal points to make this

11
12

morning.

The first is that State and regional legislators

13

who are sued under section 1983 are entitled to absolute

14

immunity if they acted in their legislative capacities.

15

Local legislators who were sued under the statute should

16

be entitled to that same absolute immunity if they acted

17

in their legislative capacities.

18

My second, and closely related point, is that --

19

QUESTION:

I can't hear you very well.

20

QUESTION:

I can't hear you at all.

21

MR. ROTHFELD:

22

My second and closely related point is that

Sorry, Your Honor.

23

public officials at all levels of Government, regional

24

officials, State officials, and local officials, do act

25

legislatively, and therefore are entitled to absolute

1

immunity when they propose legislation, vote for

2

legislation, and enact legislation.

3

Now, the facts --

4

QUESTION:

Are you going to at some point

5

address the court of appeals' reason for address -- for

6

your losing, which I didn't hear in either of the first

7

two points, because I thought the court of appeals

8

accepted both of those points.
MR. ROTHFELD:

9

Well, the court of appeals did

10

accept that there is absolute immunity for actions that

11

are taken in a legislative capacity, and we agree with the

12

court of appeals' decision on that point, a decision that

13

I add was endorsed by every circuit.
I think -- I will address the second point

14
15

subsumed within my suggestion that legislators necessarily

16

act legislatively when they propose legislation, enact

17

legislation, which is what they did here.

18

dispute in the court of appeals as to whether the

19

legislation here was legislative in character within the

20

meaning of the immunity doctrine, and I will get to that

21

point.

22

There was a

As I say, the facts that underlie this are

proposed a budget which eliminated a number of city-

2

positions -QUESTION:

3
4

Well, I think we've read the facts.

Can we get on to the issue?
MR. ROTHFELD:

5

Certainly, Your Honor.

The

6

reason I was touching on them simply is because I think

7

they provide some useful context for the legal issue, but

8

turning directly to I think what's the first underlying

9

issue in this case, are legislators, local legislators

10

entitled to absolute immunity -QUESTION:

11

On that issue, would you tell me your

12

view of what the status of the common law was at the time

13

of the enactment of the statute and, secondly, what the

14

general rule was in the courts of appeals before our

15

decision in Tahoe?
MR. ROTHFELD:

16

As to the first, I think the law,

17

the common law was clearly settled in the 19th Century.

18

think that it was the established rule, unchallenged, that

19

local legislators were entitled to absolute immunity for

20

their legislative actions, for actions of the sort in this

21

case.

22

We have searched diligently.

We have not found

23

a single 19th Century decision holding legislators liable

24

for discretionary acts related to the enactment of

25

legislation, and respondent has not cited such a case.

1

That statement of the law was reflected in the leading

2

19th Century treatises, for example, Cooley's Treatise on

3

Torts, Dillon's Treatise on Municipal Corporations, which

4

were written shortly after the enactment of section 1983.

5

Just to give you an example of a characteristic

6

statement, Cooley in his Treatise on Torts, written in

7

1880, says that so far as -- and I'm quoting here from

8

Cooley.

9

their rightful exemption from liability is very plain.

So far as legislative officers are concerned,

10

Legislatures have complete discretion in the area of

11

legislation, and it is not consistent with this that their

12

members should be called to account for their acts and

13

neglects.

14

This is also true -- and again continuing to

15

quote Cooley, this is also true of inferior legislative

16

bodies such as boards of supervisors, county

17

commissioners, city councils, and the like.

18

have searched diligently.

19

Century treatise which states a contrary rule, and I don't

20

believe that respondent has cited one either.

21

Again, we

22

absolute immunity recognized in the 19th Century, and that

to account for failing to perform ministerial duties that

were imposed by State law or by court order.

2

very narrow and precisely defined doctrine.

3

only when there was an imperative, nondiscretionary,

4

mandatory, and precise duty, as I say imposed either by

5

State law or by -QUESTION:

MR. ROTHFELD:

QUESTION:

That was a

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

Was that true of the slander cases,

too?
MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think that --we have

12

searched also and have not found a single slander case

13

against a member of a local legislative body for

14

statements relating to their legislative actions.

15

Respondent in her brief cites a number of

16

decisions which we addressed in our reply brief, and I

17

think that in fact none of them involve such statements by

18

local legislators, and it was until quite recently, it may

19

still be the common law rule, prevailing common law rule

20

that local legislators have immunity in defamation suits

21

for those actions.

22

But the important point for present purposes is

23

that in the 19th Century so far as we've been able to

24

determine there were no such suits, and so I think it's

25

quite clear -- returning to the ministerial point, it's

1

quite clear that the actions here, the actions of

2

petitioners in this case, would not have been regarded

3

remotely as ministerial in the 19th Century, and

4

respondent does not contend otherwise.

5

And so I think it is fair to say that the

6

Congress that enacted section 1983 would have regarded as

7

remarkable the suggestion that any legislator at any level

8

of Government could be held liable for actions of the sort

9

in this case.

A Member of Congress in 1871 who looked at

10

the background of common law would have seen that an

11

absolute rule of liability prevailed.

12

QUESTION:

Precisely what was the act done here?

13

I perhaps am not as familiar with the record as Justice

14

O'Connor is.

15

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think the acts that are

16

at the center of respondent's case are proposing an

17

ordinance, voting for the -- supporting the ordinance at

18

committee, voting for the ordinance, and then the mayor's

19

act in signing the ordinance.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. ROTHFELD:

And what did the ordinance provide?
The ordinance eliminated a

22

Department of Health and Human Services of the City of

23

Fall River.

QUESTION:

I thought that what -- the particular

action they're talking about is section 22 of the

1

ordinance, which reads, by striking out the following in

2

section 16-239 the words, Administrator of Health and

3

Human Services --

4

MR. ROTHFELD:

5

QUESTION:

Well --

-- right, and there's a jury

6

finding, I take it, that those words that I've just quoted

7

are in this ordinance because the defendant's stated

8

reason was wrong.

9

reason those words find their way into this ordinance is

10

because they wanted the defendant to take action against

11

the plaintiff on the basis of her speech.

12

those --

It wasn't their real reason.

13

MR. ROTHFELD:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

The real

I mean,

That is --

-- are jury findings, right, so don't

we have to take those as the facts?
MR. ROTHFELD:

Yes, at this point, certainly,

17

Justice Breyer we do not take issue with the jury's

18

determination.

19

at trial, but certainly for present purposes we accept the

20

jury's determination that there was a wrongful motivation

21

that lay behind that --

22

The issues of fact were sharply disputed

QUESTION:

Now, my -- of course, my question

23

would be -- and I want you to continue with the Chief

24

Justice's answer, but the question arising out of those

25

facts for me is, why are those legislative acts?

Why, in

1

these circumstances, aren't these particular words, and

2

given the way they found their way into this bill and that

3

they concerned one person and the removal of that one

4

person from her job, why aren't those words in these

5

circumstances an administrative action, which is what the

6

court of appeals found?

7

MR. ROTHFELD:

Right.

If I may, Justice Breyer,

8

I'll respond to the Chief Justice's question and finish

9

with my response to Justice Stevens, and then turn to

10

that, which is the second half of the argument.
The ordinance as a whole, the ordinance that was

11
12

enacted, eliminated the Department of Health and Human

13

Services.

14

that was eliminating the position of Director of the

15

Department, which was the position that was filled by

16

respondent, and so her allegation, which was accepted by

17

the jury, is that the motivation for enacting that

18

ordinance, and that portion of the ordinance, was to

19

eliminate her position, and eliminate her as a city

20

employee.

21

As Justice Breyer has indicated, an aspect of

QUESTION:

Any other aspect?

I thought that was

22

the whole thing.

The Department was just created so that

23

this other -- divisions were consolidated so -- I don't

24

understand the aspect part of your answer.

25

only thing they had to do to get rid of the Department was

I thought the

to get rid of the person who headed it.
MR. ROTHFELD:

2

Right.

Well, I -- they actually,

3

as a consequence of eliminating the Director of the

4

Department of Health and Human Services there were

5

consequences that followed from that for the organization

6

of the city government.

7

who, under the ordinance creating the Department, reported

8

to the Director, and so eliminating the position of the

9

Director required various other steps to be taken.

10

There were other city officials

Now, I

think that -QUESTION:

11

But the only legislative thing,

12

whether we call it ultimately legislative or

13

administrative, there was only one action, and that was to

14

end the position of head of HHS, no other legislation.

15

MR. ROTHFELD:

That's right.

For present

16

purposes I think we can assume that.

There was an

17

ordinance which eliminated the Department and the

18

principal consequence of that was eliminating the position

19

of Director of the Department, although I -- there were

20

these other subsidiary things that had to be taken care of

21

when that was done.

22

Reserving just for a moment the question of

23

whether that that kind of -- and it's clear it was an

24

ordinance.

25

signed by the mayor.

It was enacted by the city council.

It was

1

ordinance books of the city.

2

Reserving for the moment whether that

3

legislation is legislative in character, Justice Stevens

4

asked about the status of absolute immunity prior to the

5

Court's decision in Lake Country Estates.

6

there were a number of courts, and their decisions are

7

cited by respondent, prior to that decision which

8

recognized only qualified immunity under section 1983 for

9

local legislators.

10

I think that

I think that an examination of those decisions

11

shows that they did not -- I think did not benefit from

12

the Court's subsequent decisions setting out the nature of

13

the immunity inquiry under section 1983.

14

they did not look at all at the common law history that

15

prevailed in the 19th Century, which the Court has said is

16

the paramount indicium here, and it's interesting that one

17

of the decisions cited by respondents was written by then

18

Judge Potter Stewart on the Sixth Circuit, indicating that

19

only qualified immunity prevailed.

For example,

20

Then Justice Stewart I think changed his view,

21

because he joined Justice Powell's dissenting opinion in

22

Owen v. City of Independence, which stated expressly that

23

members of city councils are entitled to absolute

24

immunity, and so I think that the law has -- this Court's

25

immunity doctrine has been clarified and sharpened and

1

every court of appeals has now concluded that an absolute

2

rule of immunity is the appropriate one.
I should just add parenthetically that the

3
4

common law history, which I think is quite compelling, is

5

confirmed by looking at the considerations of policy that

6

the Court has identified --

7

QUESTION:

Before you get to policy, the scope

8

of this absolute immunity, is it the same as speech or

9

debate immunity for Members of Congress, or is it

10

different for a State legislature, a regional lawmaking

11

body, a municipal lawmaking body?

12

absolute immunity the same as we go down the ladder from

13

Federal to municipal?
MR. ROTHFELD:

14

Is the nature of the

I think, Your Honor, the nature

15

of the immunity is the same.

The Court has described the

16

test for legislative immunity at least as for regional and

17

State legislators in Lake Country Estates and in Tenney

18

using exactly the same terms as it has used in the Speech

19

and Debate Clause cases.
Indeed, the Court has cited the Tenney holding

20
21

as the nature -- as the test for Speech and Debate Clause

22

immunity, and so I think that the immunity is identical in

23

substance.

24
25

QUESTION:

Even for a county that has just a

single commissioner who is both the executive and the

2

legislat
MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think that that raises

3

the difficult problem of application.

4

preliminary that obviously this case is not in that mold.

5

Here we have classic legislation.

6

representative body responsible for lawmaking in the

7

jurisdiction that passes laws that are signed by the

8

executive, so we don't face that problem.

9

Let me say just

We have a multi-member

I think that the unusual forms of local

10

government, and you suggest one, present a more difficult

11

case, but I think that if the single Member is acting

12

legislatively by promulgating a law, promulgating an

13

ordinance, that the same type of immunity would apply.

14

After all, the same polices that the Court

15

identified in Lake Country Estates and in Tenney as

16

necessitating legislative immunity because of the fear

17

that prospective liability will distort legislative

18

decisionmaking, because of the fear that it will lead to

19

distracting and burdensome litigation, because of the fear

20

that it ultimately would discourage people from public

21

service, all of those considerations apply to all types of

22

municipal --

23

QUESTION:

May I interrupt you with just a -- I

24

know you want to get to Justice Breyer's question, but do

25

your comments about local legislators have the same impact

on the mayor?

2

executive, and it seems to me at least arguably the -- it

3

might not be the same rule.

4

you can shed on that?

5

You mentioned they had to be signed by the

MR. ROTHFELD:

Is there any enlightenment

Well, I think, Your Honor, that

6

as the Court has said repeatedly, the question is not the

7

branch in which the local official or a public official

8

serves, or the, you know, the source of their salary, or

9

their title, so in Butz v. Economu an executive official

10

was entitled to judicial immunity because he exercised

11

judicial functions.

12

In the Supreme Court of Virginia v. Consumers

13

Union case, judges were entitled to legislative immunity

14

because they were --

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Yes, but I'm not talking about when

the mayor cast his vote, but when he signed the -MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, and I think that what the

18

mayor did here was clearly legislative in character.

19

two -- the acts that he did, proposing the legislation and

20

signing the legislation, are essential elements of the

21

legislative process of enacting the law, and the Court in

22

the Federal context has described the President's power to

23

veto or to sign legislation as legislative in character.

24
25

The Court has said that that is an explicit
exception to the separation of powers and the
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

The

1

Constitution, and so in cases like Buckley v. Valeo and

2

others that we cite in our briefs, the Court has expressly

3

said that power is a law-making legislative power.
That is the very power that was exercised by the

4
5

mayor in this case, and so I think that as a functional

6

matter it was legislative, directed to the enactment of a

7

law, and therefore he is for those actions entitled to

8

absolute legislative immunity, and again, all the

9

considerations the Court identified in Tenney, Lake

10

Country Estates, point to that sort of immunity in this

11

case.
Now, if that is correct, and if absolute

12

13

immunity is the proper rule for local legislators, or

14

local officials acting in a legislative capacity, the

15

remaining question in this case is Justice Breyer's

16

question, were the legislators here acting in a

17

legislative way, and I would submit that the court of

18

appeals' approach to that has a slightly Lewis Carrollish

19

quality.
There is no question that all of the actions

20
21

taken by the defendants here, as I say, proposing the

22

ordinance, supporting the ordinance in committee, voting

23

for the ordinance, and signing the ordinance, were

24

directed to the enactment of a municipal law, to an

25

ordinance.

Now, the court of appeals argument, the court of

1

2

appeals holding in this case, which is endorsed by

3

respondent, is that some legislation is essentially more

4

legislative than others, that legislation does not have a

5

legislative quality if the sponsors are motivated by

6

specific facts, what the court of appeals called specific

7

facts, or if the legislation is excessively narrow in

8

scope, if it affects only a small number of identifiable

9

persons.
QUESTION:

10

Well, the court of appeals used the

11

term, administrate, but you describe the common law

12

immunity as extending to everything except ministerial

3

action, and I think the word administrative connotes a

4

much broader exception than the term ministerial, doesn't

5

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, absolutely.

Clearly the

7

court of appeals was not deriving its administrative

8

exception from the common law.

9

the ministerial exception, or perhaps the immunity that

It had nothing to do with

I think the court of appeals' view, and

22

respondent's view, is that legislation which is, as I say,

23

based on -- in which the legislator's motivation is based

24

on what the court called specific facts, or if the

25

legislation is too narrow, that legislation is simply not

Now - -

QUESTION:

But maybe what they had in mind is if

5

the mayor just said, you're discharged, that would be,

7

maybe the court of appeals is saying, well, that's a nice

way to get around liability for administrative acts.

9

Don't say, you're fired.

10
11

Get the city council to pass an

ordinance that says she's fired.
MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, a couple of points in

12

response to that, Your Honor, which, I think that is a

13

very important question that goes to the heart of

14

respondent's argument.

15

First of all, just as a matter of clarification

16

as to what exactly went on here, the city council did not

17

say, this individual is fired.

18

eliminated this position for all time, so that's a classic

19

legislative action.

20

longer is this position in the city government.

21

The city council

It passed a law providing there no

I think that that is identical to what would

22

occur if, for example, Congress passed a law eliminating

23

funding for the coming fiscal year for the Office of the

24

Secretary of Health and Human Services.

opposite.

I mean, as you define legislation, if the

2

legislation said that the current incumbent of this

3

office -- assuming this is within the legislative power,

4

you would still say that's okay, it's legislation.

5

MR. ROTHFELD:

QUESTION:

I would say that, although I --

And you would say that if the

7

mayor -- if you accept the conclusion of Justice

8

Ginsburg's question, this was a neat way around liability,

9

you would say precisely --

10

MR. ROTHFELD:

11

QUESTION:

12

Well --

-- it is, that that's simply the law,

that you're not liable for legislative action.
MR. ROTHFELD:

13

As I say, there are a number of

14

points to make in response to that.

I think -- first of

15

all, that is our position, that if the legislative body

16

passes a law, whatever it says, it is legislative in

17

character.
Now, there may be other constitutional defects

18
19

in that law.

20

think in this case such a law would have been outside the

21

city council's statutory authority under Massachusetts law

22

and under its own city council, but I think it would be

23

legislative in character, and if you look at --

24
25

It may be a bill of attainder.

Absolutely.

Absolutely.

Whether it's at the city level or the

State level.
MR. ROTHFELD:

11

That's true.

Now, in fact,

actually that points up a more compelling reason for

that kind of statute at the State level they may have no

subterfuge which, after all, takes the same form.

takes the form of legislation.

would such a thing be legislative in character.

what would happen --

MR. ROTHFELD:

That's the question.
What would happen if Congress

passed -- Congress passes laws all the time that are

10

intended to and have the effect of affecting only one

person.

12

that are aimed at one person, a law that says, Chrysler is

hereby bailed out because that's in the public interest --

14

Even leaving private bills aside, tax exemptions

QUESTION:

Oh, no, but now, once you're down

15

that track, once you admit an exception to the absolute

rule of the form of legislation, then this looks like a

pretty good case for that exception, doesn't it?

MR. ROTHFELD:

QUESTION:

Well, but --

Because there are jury findings that

that the -- it's like the Speech or Debate Clause.

would you -- if the city is the defendant, and your charge

I think I may have been confused.

I

20

think the scope of the immunity is identical to the Speech

and Debate Clause.

22

Now, whether or not an individual could be sued,

could be called -- an individual local legislator could be

called to testify in a suit against a third party, clearly

for that, so in that sense there is no section 1983 speech

Now, whether there is some Federal evidentiary

privilege that would -- could be asserted in such a

5

circumstance has not been determined by this Court and is

certainly not going to be decided by this case.

QUESTION:

But at least it is an open question.

8

It's not so clear that the city would -- you'd have to

9

answer that question.

10

MR. ROTHFELD:

The second part of my answer to

11

your question, Justice Ginsburg, is that there are many

12

ways of proving legislative motive that do not require

13

individual testimony by --

14

QUESTION:

Give me an example.

Here, how would

15

you prove that this city council passed this not because

16

of a budget crunch but because they wanted to get rid of

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think in ways that

19

respondent in this case did attempt to prove that.

20

showed, or attempted to show, that there had been

21

altercations between herself and members of the city

22

council or other city employees that were brought to the

attention of the city council.

been doing, and there are a wide range of circumstantial

indicia.

I think in the Equal Protection Clause area this

QUESTION:

Do you think that the -- that Judge

6

Sowerby was wrong when he said, ah, but that's not enough,

7

there's nine people on that council, and you tell me that

8

two of them, you've got circumstantial proof with respect

9

to two of them, you can't prove a claim against the city

10
11

on that basis?
MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think that the First

12

Circuit suggested that the reason the case came out this

13

way, perhaps, as to municipal liability is the manner in

14

which it was litigated, that respondent made virtually no

15

attempt to demonstrate by any means the motivations of

16

these other members of the city council and, for example,

17

one could imagine that a plaintiff in a case like this

18

might try to show that there is an individual member of

19

the council, like the chair of the Budget Committee, who

is -- as to whom everyone defers automatically, and that

is essentially a de facto policymaker.

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well --

I'm not comforted by your assurance

that you can sue the city, because I'm -- you know, most

of the arguments you make in defense of your clients here

it seems to me are makable just as well with respect to

of municipal governance if you could claim that

10

12

I think it would be a very serious disruption

for improper reasons.
MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, that, I think, Your Honor,

goes to the substantive nature of the constitutional

3

violation that's being alleged, and it doesn't turn on the

4

nature of municipal liability.

QUESTION:

That is correct.

But against the municipality, what

bothers me -- I don't know the answer to this.

7

your approach, you take legislation that's neutral on its

face, and you hold the city liable if it's passed for an

unconstitutional motive, which brings you into a very big

problem of how you prove motive for individual

dangerous thing for public officials if it were possible

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

The jury found in this case that the mayor of

the City of Fall River and the city council vice president

23

came up with a scheme to punish Janet Scott-Harris because

24

she exercised her constitutionally protected right to

complain that she and other minority employees of the city

were being called names such as the black nigger bitch,

2

and that -- because she attempted to bring disciplinary-

3

charges against the well-connected long-time city employee

4

who made these statements.

5

The mayor conceded at trial, he agreed with the

6

trial judge that Ms. Scott-Harris' speech was

7

constitutionally protected.

8

conceded at trial that he had authority under

9

Massachusetts law -- in fact, the Massachusetts statute

Significantly, the mayor also

10

was marked as Exhibit 85 -- that he had authority on his

11

own, without any action by the city council, to fire, to

12

lay off, to remove Ms. Scott-Harris from city government.

3

He had authority to put somebody else into her office.

4

had authority to have other people, the people who had

5

reported to her report to the city manager.

6

that was done by this ordinance the mayor could have done

administratively, on his own.

point is whether this was a legislative act at all if it

MR. SCHWARTZ:

1

I'm not saying that they're

necessarily mutually exclusive, but if you apply the

Court's functionality test, if you say, is the firing of

one employee an administrative function or is that a

5

6

And where does the Court's

7

functionality test that you refer to, where does that come

8

from?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

9

For example, in the Virginia

10

supreme court case, Virginia Supreme Court v. Consumers

11

Union.

12

different forms of immunity for different functions.

13

have absolute legislative immunity when State actors

judicial immunity when State actors function in a

actors function in an administrative or executive

capacity.

You're not trying to say that every

he's not acting in a legislative capacity.

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Oh, no.

No.

I agree that he was

acting in a legislative capacity, but I think it's

important to focus on what the conduct was.

His conduct

an action that he admitted he would not have even had

qualified immunity for, he never filed a qualified

immunity -- asserted a qualified immunity defense, because

the right not to be fired because of your speech was

clearly established.

So this was an action that he could have taken

on his own.

Instead, he chose to submit this to the city council.

He would have had no immunity of any kind.

has to get a whole bunch of other people to agree.

On the other hand, when it comes to matters of

MR. SCHWARTZ:

The difficulty found by the

court of appeals, however, was, although it was easy to

6

prove the motivation of the mayor and Roderick, the court

7

of appeals found that we weren't able to prove the

8

collective motivation of the board, or of a sufficient

9

number of members of the board.
I would like to address the more underlying

10
11

question of the common law basis for this absolute

12

legislative immunity at the local level, because I suggest

13

that the common law, as it was established in 1871, is

14

nowhere near as clearly established as petitioner

15

suggests.

16

Every single case cited by petitioners, every

17

single authority cited by petitioners relies on the

18

discretionary ministerial doctrine, and petitioners say

19

that the conduct at issue in this case was discretionary,

20

therefore there's no liability.

21

Petitioners also agree -- and they cite an 1877

22

case, Jones v. Loving, at page 24 of their brief.

23

also agree that this discretionary ministerial doctrine

24

applied equally to the municipality itself as it did to

25

the municipal decisionmakers, and they're correct in that,

body are clothed with the immunity of the municipality.

That immunity came from the discretionary ministerial

doctrine.

as it was for the municipality's decisionmakers.

6

The immunity was the same for the municipality

Now, in Owens v. City of Independence this Court

7

relied quite heavily on the discretionary ministerial

8

doctrine to find that there was no immunity of any kind

9

for municipalities under section 1983.

The Court said

10

that there's no discretion to violate the Constitution,

11

that the Constitution is mandatory, and that it is not a

12

discretionary act to violate the Constitution.

13

The question in this case was, as found by the

14

jury, did the mayor have the discretion to submit an

ordinance to remove Janet Scott-Harris from city

2

1983, the dissenting justices said that the discretionary

ministerial doctrine parallels quite closely the qualified

4

immunity standard of this Court under Harlow v.

Fitzgerald, and I suggest that that discretionary

ministerial doctrine does parallel this Court's present

qualified immunity doctrine.
Under that doctrine, State officials have

unless their discretionary act violates a clearly

This Court relied upon Coffin for the position

11

that the common law provided absolute immunity to members

of the State legislature in a libel action regardless of

13

whether they acted maliciously or not.

14

Well, 20 years after Coffin v. Coffin, the same

15

Massachusetts court, the Massachusetts supreme judicial

16

court, in the same form of action, a slander action

17

brought against a member of a town governing board, the

Brookline Board of Selectmen, did not apply that same

19

absolute legislative immunity at the local level, but

instead the Massachusetts supreme judicial court said that

10

that was not imposed at the State level, and also the

11

discretional ministerial doctrine that imposed liability

12

in some circumstances at the local level, where there

13

would not be liability at the State level, shows that the

common law distinguished between State legislators and

local legislators, and because the common law

MR. SCHWARTZ:

established, thou shalt not fire an employee because of

Well, if that's what you mean by a

MR. SCHWARTZ:

I'm saying it's legislation, but

that that was -- constituted a bill of attainder, and it

was not legitimate legislation.

So that there's a definition of

the definition of legislation otherwise?

Well, yes, Your Honor.

We had a

No, but the reason you were debating

it was that the town had to appropriate money, which was a

legislative act, isn't that the case?

6

MR. SCHWARTZ:

7

QUESTION:

Well, not in that case.

The person who spent the money, I

presume, was the board of selectmen, and I assume they

weren't acting as legislators when they spent the money.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

10

Well, not in that case.

The

money had already been appropriated.

But I mean, aren't those pretty garden variety
examples of classifications that are fairly easy to make?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, if one were to say that

anything done by a legislative body is legislation, but

anything done by an executive body is executive, that

would certainly be a simple solution, but I don't know

that that would address the realities of local government.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES ROTHFELD

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

16

18

MR. ROTHFELD:

Thank you, Your Honor.

I have a

couple of points which I will endeavor to make quick.
First of all, I think the easiest way to

19

conceptualize the question of whether this is legislative

20

action in this case is to -- and perhaps it's built on

21

Justice O'Connor's example from Arizona -- is to imagine

22

what would happen if this happened at the Federal level.

23

If the President fired the Secretary of HHS,

24

that would be an administrative act.

25

bill eliminating funding for the Office of the Secretary

If Congress passed a

1

of HHS for the next fiscal year, everybody I think would

2

acknowledge that would be a legislative act, and that the

3

Members of Congress would be shielded by the Speech and

4

Debate Clause if the incumbent Secretary of HHS sued them

5

on a First Amendment theory.

identical to that.

QUESTION:

legislation, which would be -MR. ROTHFELD:

Or the President, if he proposed

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. ROTHFELD:

Second, I think that the court of

13

appeals and respondent acknowledge that if this facially

14

neutral ordinance had been promulgated for proper reasons,

15

for -- purely for the purpose of saving money, it would,

16

in fact, be legislative in character.

test requires in every case of this sort that there be

18

a -- in that circumstance, absolute immunity would be

19

proper, because it would be legislative in character.

Therefore, their

Their test requires that in every case of this

20
21

sort there be an examination, therefore, into the

22

legislative motive before an inquiry into immunity is

23

conducted.

24

a trial before immunity is decided, and yet --

25

That means that there has to be discovery and

Of course, isn't that true in any

1

case in which the constitutional violation has an element

2

of motive in it?
MR. ROTHFELD:

3

Well, not if there's an absolute

4

immunity rule for acts that are in the form of

5

legislation, as we suggest.
If, having passed a law that determines that it

6

7

is legislative in character, then I think at that point

8

absolute immunity applies, and there's no need for an

9

inquiry into motive, otherwise immunity really becomes

10

entirely meaningless, because in every case of this sort

11

there will be a possibility to argue that we -- there was

12

a specific fact in the minds of the legislators, and I

13

should be entitled, the plaintiff will say, to obtain

14

discovery into those facts, and therefore immunity goes by

15

the boards.

16

The third point, relating to Owen, which was

17

cited by respondent, I think Owen has no bearing in this

18

case.

19

history in Owen, that the -- there was a discretionary

20

immunity for acts of municipalities because common law

21

judges were unwilling to substitute their judgments, their

22

discretionary judgments for municipal acts in areas of the

23

municipalities' proper purview.

The Court suggested, looking at the common law

24
25

The rationale for legislative immunity is quite
distinct.

The idea there is that legislators should not
