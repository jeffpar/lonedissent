CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in Number 96-7171, Randy G. Spencer v. Mike Kemna.

5

Mr. Simon.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN W. SIMON

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SIMON:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In September 1992 the State of Missouri revoked

10
11

Randy Spencer's parole on the basis of the Board of

12

Probation and Parole's finding that he had committed

13

forcible rape, armed criminal action, and possession of

14

crack cocaine.

15

After exhausting his State remedies, Spencer

16

filed a Federal habeas corpus action asserting Federal

17

constitutional violations concerning this revocation which

18

would, if recognized, have required the court to hold it

19

invalid.

20

About 4 months after Spencer filed his petition,

21

the State released him on parole again for good behavior,

22

but without expunging the order of revocation or

23

abandoning its finding that he was guilty of these three

24

serious felonies.

25

Nearly 2-1/2 years after he filed his petition,

1

the district court dismissed it as moot.

2

In conflict with the decisions of every other

3

United States court of appeals that had then issued a

4

published opinion dealing with the subject, the court

5

below affirmed the district court's dismissal.

6

An official governmental finding that one is

7

guilty of forcible rape, armed criminal action, and

8

possession of crack cocaine has collateral consequences

9

like those of a criminal conviction per se.
QUESTION:

10

It does?

I thought that if you're

11

convicted of a crime, A, then under the guidelines in many

12

States when you're convicted of crime B your sentence

13

automatically goes up, and I thought that wasn't true

14

here, that if your parole is revoked there is no guideline

15

or statute that says you get an increased sentence because

16

of a parole revocation, though of course they could give

17

you an increased sentence on the basis of that for which

18

the parole was revoked.

19

MR. SIMON:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. SIMON:

22

23

Justice Breyer -Am I wrong, because -- yes.
Justice Breyer, I've two responses

to that.
The first is that although it is not automatic

24

in the case, it is not automatic that under the guidelines

25

you would get it -- you would get a higher sentence solely

on the basis of the parole revocation, the parole

2

revocation can force one's offense into the 15-year

3

window --

4

QUESTION:

I thought -- am I not -- what I was

5

saying is, I thought that that which does it is not the

6

parole revocation, it is that for which the parole was

7

revoked.
In other words, the defendant would always have

8

9

a chance to say, but I didn't do this thing,

I didn't

10

commit -- I didn't do that for which, and then the parole

11

board or whoever, the court would consider, did he do it

12

or didn't he do it.

of a crime.

14
15

You can't do that if you're convicted

I just want to know if I'm right.

Is that right

or not?

16

MR. SIMON:

I agree with --

17

QUESTION:

Tell me if I'm --

18

MR. SIMON:

I agree with what you're saying,

19

Justice Breyer, but in Sibron this Court -- this Court

20

considered that question in respect to criminal

21

convictions -QUESTION:

22

All right, but I mean, the first part

23

was, is that right, and then if I'm right, then why --

24

then you're going to explain why it doesn't matter.

Go

MR. SIMON:

1

2

Well -- yes.

Thank you, Your Honor.

You are right.

3

You are right in that the parole revocation does

4

not have exactly the same effect under the Sentencing

5

Guidelines as a criminal conviction.
However, to put the burden on the petitioner and

6

7

then defendant in the -- under the guidelines of

8

impeaching the parole revocation years after the fact has

9

the same things wrong with it that it would have in the

10

Sibron situation, where this Court said that we shouldn't

11

require people to come in years after the fact when they

12

have proceeded to litigate the claims under the rules as

13

Sibron and Randy Spencer have done.

14

QUESTION:

But in Lane v. Williams we said that

15

the same factors don't apply, that the parole revocation

16

situation not becoming moot, we limited Sibron to say what

17

it said, the legal consequences, and said that some of the

18

other consequences that you're talking about did not

19

prevent it from becoming moot.

20

modify or abandon Lane v. Williams for you to prevail,

21

must we not?
MR. SIMON:

22

23

You really -- we must

Certainly not abandon, Mr. Chief

Justice.

24

QUESTION:

MR. SIMON:

But considerably cut back on it.
I'm not even sure of that, Mr. Chief

Justice.

Lane is distinguishable on numerous grounds.

2

The prisoners there neither challenged their parole

3

revocations nor sought relief, nor put the consequences of

4

those revocations at issue by seeking expungement of their

5

records.
The target in Lane was the guilty plea way back

6

7

when, not the parole revocation.

8

from what they contended to be an involuntary guilty plea.

9

If -QUESTION:

10

They were seeking relief

But didn't we say in Lane that

11

consequences -- we're talking about whether something

12

becomes moot.

13

effect as statutory consequences would not be regarded as

14

keeping a case from being moot.

15

MR. SIMON:

16

things have changed since Lane.

The consequences that didn't have the same

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. SIMON:

Correct, Your Honor.

However,

What has changed?
Well, first of all the Court's

19

doctrine on that has changed, because in Evitts the Court

20

added -QUESTION:

21

22

That was a footnote in -- on a point

that wasn't even argued.
MR. SIMON:

23

Well, Your Honor, I believe -- well

24

now, of course, Your Honor, I wouldn't know whether it was

25

argued.

The Court would know that.

QUESTION:

1

Well, you can tell whether -- just

2

from the way it's put in a footnote you can tell it wasn't

3

argued.

4

MR. SIMON:

Your Honor, the material that is

5

most damaging to my client in Lane is also in a footnote.

6

The question is what the Court held in Lane and

7

in Evitts, rather than the typography of where the points

8

appeared and in Lane, the question that my client is

9

asking the Court to decide, this wasn't before the Court,

10

because in Lane the prisoners did not argue that the State

11

of Illinois had violated their Federal constitutional

12

rights as explained in Morrissey and Gagnon.

13

was just different, Your Honor.

The target

I know the language is there, but not only were

14
15

the facts different in Lane and the procedural posture was

16

different, but Lane predated Evitts' addition of sentence

17

enhancement and testimonial impeachment to the list of

18

collateral consequences and, furthermore, one of the

19

things the Court relied on in Lane, as far as the reader

20

can tell, is the speculative nature of what was going to

21

happen.

22

And it's my position, Your Honor, that the

23

consequences of that, of a parole revocation, especially a

24

serious one like this, one sex offense, one weapons

25

offense, one drug offense, the consequences of these are

2

far more powerful -QUESTION:

Well, are you saying then that

3

whether or not a case has become moot may depend upon the

4

seriousness of the charges in the parole revocation?

5

MR. SIMON:

Only if the Court chooses to apply

6

Sibron to parole revocations, Your Honor.

If the Court

7

goes on a case-by-case basis and just says, well, in this

8

case it's forcible rape, armed criminal action, and

9

possession of crack cocaine, well, we're going to hold

10

that it's not moot, if the Court feels that that would be

11

unmanageable because courts would have to decide it on a

12

case-by-case basis, the Court could apply the Sibron

13

presumption.

14

My client wins either way because of the grossly

15

stigmatic characteristics of the felonies that he's been

16

found guilty of without a trial.

17

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Simon, as I understand it,

18

you're concerned about the stigma as it would apply at the

19

point of a subsequent parole revocation.

20

I would suppose that the stigma that you refer

21

to would be far more powerful at the point of a subsequent

22

decision to parole in the first place, and yet that does

23

not seem to be your concern.

24
25

Why does the stigma become greater when he has
been paroled and the question is, will parole be revoked,

1

than it was, or seems to be on your calculus, at the point

2

at which he would be subject to parole?

3

MR. SIMON:

Your Honor, we have been a little

4

more soft-spoken about the parole consequences per se, but

5

we have never abandoned them, and they -QUESTION:

6

Did you argue them in the -- I

7

thought your argument on the circuit was that the adverse

8

consequences that you're concerned about are adverse

9

consequences at the point of a later parole revocation.

10

Was I -- am I wrong about that?
MR. SIMON:

11

I -- Your Honor, I am not sure about

12

where the focus of it was, except that in the Eighth

13

Circuit the focus was on the parole consequences as -- and

14

to the exclusion, I will concede, of later consequences

15

such as sentence enhancement.

16

QUESTION:

17
18

if I may.

Let me ask you a different question,

It goes back to what Justice Breyer began with.
I take it you accept the fact that at a later

19

parole revocation hearing, at least, you could indeed

20

argue and present evidence to the effect that the

21

underlying conduct that was assumed in this revocation in

22

fact didn't take place.

23

MR. SIMON:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. SIMON:

Yes.
You could be heard on that.
Yes, Your Honor.

1

QUESTION:

Is it also the case -- do you assume

2

that you could also make this argument:

3

consider the fact o f - t-he earlier parole revocation as such

4

independently of the underlying conduct, because I was

5

doing my best,

6

means of habeas at the time I was released,

7

the habeas issue became moot and I could never go to

8

judgment,

9

not consider the parole revocation as such.

10
11

you may not

I had done my best to litigate that by
and therefore

so therefore you shall not consider, you must

That argument would be open to you,
wouldn't it,

12

and --

and wouldn't it be successful?

MR. SIMON:

Your Honor,

if I were representing

13

Mr. Spencer on that hypothetical case I would certainly

14

make the argument that you're suggesting, Justice Souter.

15

However,

I think that Occam's razor would tell

16

us that we should recognize collateral consequences before

17

we require counsel or particularly the pro se parole

18

candidate to make an argument that intricate,

19

that it is an intricate argument that a resourceful

20

counsel who is sitting here with us today would make.
QUESTION:

21

and I agree

Mr. Simon, may I just clarify one

22

thing?

I thought that you were making the point in

23

connection with your client that it wasn't that they'd let

24

him out at parole and then it would only be -- the

25

question would be to put him back.

I thought you were talking about the reduction

1

2

of his chances now to be paroled when you called our

3

attention to the guideline in Missouri that says, will

4

they let him out now on parole when he's due?

5

there appears -- there does not appear to be a reasonable

6

probability that he would live and remain at liberty

7

without violating the law, so I thought you were talking

8

about the reduction of his chances of being paroled.

9

MR. SIMON:

Not if

Justice Ginsburg, the guideline that

10

you're quoting is from the Missouri sentencing guidelines

11

rather than their parole guidelines.
We acknowledge that it's discretionary with the

12

13

board how much weight the board should give to this parole

14

revocation in the board's decision, but I believe that

15

what the Court was just quoting was a document for the use

16

of Missouri courts in passing sentences.

17

QUESTION:

It says -- can we take the case,

18

then, that there's not a single statute which attaches

19

adverse consequences to parole revocation in and of

20

itself.

21

MR. SIMON:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. SIMON:

24
25

No, Your Honor, we can't -Or am I wrong about that?
We can't take that because of the

15-year window under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.
QUESTION:

No, there's -- I'm sorry.

Is --

1

that's what I was wondering.

Federal Sentencing Guidelines that says parole revocation

itself makes a difference?

QUESTION:

MR. SIMON:

6

There's something in the

In and of itself.
Well, it's -- I guess it depends on

what we mean by in and of itself.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. SIMON:

9

QUESTION:

No -Consequences.
What I mean by this is the following,

10

and I think maybe Justice Kennedy means the same.

If you

11

have a prior conviction and then you come up for

12

sentencing again, that's it, you know.

13

You go into another column, or you get an -- that -- all

14

that, the judge will look to is, is there another

15

conviction?

You get a bump up.

I mean, that's basically the rule.

16

MR. SIMON:

17

QUESTION:

You can't attack it anyway?
Well, I don't know.

That's why I

18

hesitated, because there may be certain things you could

19

attack.

20

MR. SIMON:

No counsel, for example.

21

QUESTION:

22

But now, parole revocation I thought was

Yes.

Yes, that's right, exactly.

23

different.

That's why I started with this, that there is

24

nothing that the parole revocation in and of itself gives

25

you a bump up for.

Rather, a judge would look at it and say, hmm,

his parole's been revoked.

good to me.

counsel would argue about it, and they'd say, you know, it

wasn't -- et cetera.

QUESTION:

You've read it recently with this in

mind, and so I raised it because I fear I could be

17

overlooking something, which is why I raised it.
MR. SIMON:

18

Your Honor, the big picture in

19

respect to the Sentencing Guidelines is that before the

20

Sentencing Guidelines were authorized and adopted a

21

Federal sentencing court had virtually unbridled

22

discretion.

23

discretion, the scope of the sentencing judge's discretion

has been cabined, and one of the factors that goes into

2

that at various points is the 15-year window, concerning

which it does definitely have an effect and there's no

wriggling out of it.

For prior offenses.

Not parole revocation as such -Not --- for prior offenses.
Not as such, Your Honor, but the

14

parole revocation makes a difference in the 15-year

15

window.

16

But the big picture, members of the court, is

17

that the Sentencing Guidelines have narrowed that window

No, Your Honor, because of the

1

not -- this argument for collateral consequences, whether

2

as applied to parole revocations or criminal convictions,

3

does not assume that the person is going to go out and

4

commit another crime.

5

Everything, all of the factors that the Court

6

has relied on in Carafas, in Evitts, wherever the Court

7

has talked about collateral consequences, there is some

8

intervening act, some intervening decision that the person

9

burdened by the collateral consequences must make.

10

One thing that everyone agrees on as a

11

collateral consequence is jury service.

12

is kept from serving on a jury because he or she is a

13

convicted felon is -- depends on whether they're called

14

for jury duty, whether they come up with some excuse in

MR. SIMON:

Agreed, Your Honor, and there's no

2

way that I'm arguing that anyone should commit crimes.

3

However -- however, Your Honor, the same argument would

4

cut against other guarantees of the rights of the accused.

5

It's always -- when -- it would -- there would

always be an answer to a criminal defendant who seeks to

7

overturn his or her conviction by saying, well, you

MR. SIMON:

1

Agreed, Your Honor.

The question is

2

whether this Court and Congress, as the two key

3

decisionmakers in this area, want that result to happen,

4

and Congress -- Congress, as we all know, has recently

5

revisited habeas -- Federal habeas corpus at the -- almost

6

simultaneously they revisited 1983 in PILRA, and in -- the

7

Congress considered these things very seriously.
They considered them after the majority of the

8

9

circuits, eight circuits by my count, had held that claims

10

like my client's were not moot, and they didn't amend

11

2254 .

12

QUESTION:

Well, they didn't amend it, but what

13

do you think in the congressional statutes dealing with

14

habeas corpus reflects a congressional desire that there

15

be a hearing in Federal court for every asserted violation

16

of the Federal Constitution in State criminal proceedings,

17

or parole proceedings?

I gather you do not question the right of the

conclusions that they led to in the parole violations.

QUESTION:

Okay.

So if they have the right to

keep the evidence, what if they came in and said, well,

the parole violation doesn't mean anything in terms of, as

they basically argued, they said, therefore we'll take it

That would satisfy you.

I don't know why they don't do that

Do the Missouri courts allow impeachment of a witness on

MR. SIMON:

Your Honor, I believe that the two

sides have cited all of the Missouri cases on that, and

that the -- as -- they argue one side, we argue the other.

It's our position that as long as one asks the question

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. LAYTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
After Sibron, Lane, and the footnote in Evitts,
we might be able to divide collateral consequences that

20

are alleged to defeat mootness into three categories.

21

first are those that are current civil disabilities, those

22

that led to the decision in Sibron -- can't vote, can't

23

serve on a jury, those kinds of things.

24
25

The

A second category are the ones that were
addressed in Lane, things that are discretionary that we

1

can't know now, for example, whether a past parole

2

revocation may have some impact on a future parole

3

request, or, to take that to its ultimate, where the Ninth

4

Circuit has said that perhaps a sufficient collateral

5

consequence is how this revocation might affect someone's

6

chances of employment in the future.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Layton, maybe I misremember

8

Sibron, but I thought, unlike the first case, Carafas, or

9

whatever, which dealt with only present disability, Sibron

10

did speak about future problems as a result of the

11

conviction, like being impeached as a witness.

12

MR. LAYTON:

It did speak of those.

However,

3

all of the precedents that Sibron cited to support the

4

premise that it could draw a line beyond which there is a

5

presumption against mootness were felony cases.

6

Every one of those is a case that involves

7

current civil disability, so Sibron is not clear as to

8

what it means in terms of what kind of disability today

9

would be sufficient, but the tenor of Sibron is there is a

20

conviction, and in our society we presume when there is a

21

conviction that there are some effects today, as opposed

22

to other kinds of things that may happen to someone as a

23

result of our judicial system.

24

A third category of alleged collateral

25

consequences are those that are contingent on some future
26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

event, although they may not be discretionary after the

2

contingency occurs, and that leads us to the question of

3

the Federal Sentencing Guidelines that Justice Breyer was

4

asking about at the beginning of Mr. Simon's presentation,

5

and that are addressed for the first time in this respect

6

in the reply brief on the merits.

7

There is in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines a

8

provision that says, we will give points in criminal

9

history for all of the convictions where the incarceration

10

comes within the last 15 years, and by revoking

11

Mr. Spencer's parole, Mr. Spencer -- the time of Mr.

12

Spencer's conviction or his incarceration was extended.

13

So if Mr. Spencer is convicted of a crime

14

between April 16, 2007 and August 7, 2008, then the

15

Federal Guidelines would be affected by this parole

16

revocation, but not otherwise, and I think that shows the

17

difficult position that Mr. Spencer asks this Court to

18

take, that we assume that it is enough to defeat mootness

19

today that he may commit a crime during a relatively brief

20

period in the next century, and yet that's the position

21

that he's taken, that the Ninth Circuit has taken, that

22

that kind of sentence enhancement is sufficient.

23

The consequences Mr. Spencer alleges fall within

24

three general categories, that it may affect a future

25

parole decision -- what was addressed in Lane, and which
27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400

1

is an entirely discretionary decision under Missouri

2

law -- whether it would affect him at trial through

3

impeachment or perhaps a presentation of evidence under

4

Federal Rule of Evidence 413, or whether it would affect

5

his sentencing.

6

And then comes the question of the 1983 action,

7

which doesn't really fit in any of these categories of

8

collateral consequences, because his loss of a 1983 claim

9

is not the result of the parole revocation.

10
11

It's not the

result of the hearing about which he complains.
It's the result of his failure to obtain a

12

successful decision in his habeas, or a State or a Federal

13

habeas, and I think there are three reasons why the Court

14

should resist the urge of Mr. Spencer to adopt the

15

position that a 1983 claim, or a loss of the 1983 claim

16

would be enough to defeat mootness.

17

The first is that it is too far removed from the

18

question at hand, which is the parole revocation.

19

second is that --

20

QUESTION:

The

I'm not sure I follow that, because

21

isn't it as a practical matter, given that when you're put

22

back in, parole is revoked, it's not for a very long time,

23

and almost in every case you couldn't get through the

24

whole process.

go into the Federal, so these things are bound to be moot,

2

aren't they, because even -- you're talking here about

3

district court delay, but that wouldn't be enough.

4

have to go -- Lane didn't become moot till it was in this

5

Court, right?

6

MR. LAYTON:

You'd

I think these things are bound to

7

become moot, and I think that the problem Mr. Spencer has

8

where he suggests that he is unusual somehow in losing a

9

1983 claim is -- well, let's present a hypothetical about

10
11

Mr. Spencer.
Let's suppose that his State remedies were not

12

exhausted until the day after he was reparoled.

He

13

wouldn't have a 1983 claim, not because of anything the

14

State had done, but because it just took a while for that

15

process to happen.

16

And yet he suggests here the Court ought to

17

announce a new rule that because of the timing of his

18

case, somehow, if we have a 1983 claim it will be lost,

19

the case is no longer moot.

20

Now, one of the things that that does is, it

21

would -- to adopt that would endorse the position that

22

Mr. Spencer can come before this Court and raise that

23

issue for the first time.

24
25

In his brief he wonders how the Eighth Circuit,
with its own precedent of Leonard v. Nix, could have
29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.
SUITE 400

(800) FOR DEPO

1

reached the decision that it did, given the -- a loss of a

2

1983 cause of action.

3

Well, the reason is because he never raised the

4

question of a 1983 cause of action in the Eighth Circuit,

5

and so for this Court to adopt that would be to endorse

6

the premise that all of these collateral consequences save

7

one, which were raised for the first time in this Court --

8

in fact, for the first time generally in the reply to the

9

cert petition -- that that's the way that someone should

10
11

operate.

You can do these things late.
I think the third reason why the Court should

12

not adopt the premise that a 198 -- loss of a 1983 cause

13

of action is sufficient to prevent mootness is that that

14

would in effect move the Sibron presumption from just

15

covering habeas petitions that challenge convictions to

16

covering essentially all habeas petitions, because what

17

habeas petitioner, if the Court were to so rule, is going

18

to resist the urge to say, oh, I have a 1983 cause of

19

action, and so, judge, you can't dismiss my case.

20

QUESTION:

Let me ask you something, Mr. Layton.

21

Is there any other procedure in Missouri whereby the

22

prisoner could get some kind of declaratory judgment or

23

any other relief finding that he was denied any hearing on

24

these charges?

25

MR. LAYTON:

Perhaps not, Justice O'Connor.

The

appropriate method would have been through a petition for

3

It may be possible for him to enter into, or

QUESTION:

2

MR. LAYTON:

Yes.
But if the State had a policy or

3

program or practice of doing what Your Honor says, then he

would -- could have a 1983 claim to stop that practice,

5

not to question his own determination, but to stop that

6

practice, and he would have an incentive to do that, since

7

he's already incarcerated again, and although he's been

8

given a new parole date on his new sentence, he has yet to

9

be paroled, and so he could do that.

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Layton, what about the State

13

denied without explanation, and so it is impossible to do

more than assume that they were ruling on the merits, with

the possible exception of the intermediate court, where he

used the wrong writ, although the Missouri practice is,

MR. LAYTON:

I don't know that that is a stupid

question, because it's something that I've considered

11

carefully.

12

In Pennsylvania v. Mims, where the question

13

before this Court was also mootness, but mootness where

14

the State wanted to continue litigating the case, the

15

Court said that it was -- well, the -- Justice Marshall in

16

a sense said it was barely not moot because the State had

17

an interest in some future sentencing.

18

Here we aren't even to that point.

It's hard to

19

imagine what great incentive there is going to be for the

20

parole board if Mr. Spencer is now before the board and

21

has been told the board is to give him a new hearing.

22

does the board care whether they give him a new hearing or

It's a -- all right.

So we're only

14

talking about the cases where the prisoner was in custody

MR. LAYTON:

1

I don't know that the Constitution

2

does stop him from getting the relief he wants.

3

question here is not his constitutional right but his

4

statutory right, either under the habeas statute or 1983,

to someone in this man's situation, and so it's not a

constitutional right -QUESTION:

We're saying

10

that given the change in circumstance -- maybe it's the

right word, but given the change in circumstance, the

12

relief he wants is outside the phrase I quoted in the

statute.

14

MR. LAYTON:

15

QUESTION:

Correct.
It couldn't be relief that law and

justice requires, and the reason it couldn't be is because

too little turns on it.

MR. LAYTON:

QUESTION:

No -- well, we -- how can we say that

is no longer in custody can bring it?

MR. LAYTON:

3

QUESTION:

I think that Justice Breyer

Yes.

Yes, if one goes back to the --

4

if one wants to analyze it by the statute, according to

5

Justice Breyer, one would never have decided Carafas or

6

Sibron the way they did.

7

MR. LAYTON:

It's certainly possible to go to

8

where Justice Thomas led in, I believe it's the Heck

9

decision, and not have any of these problems, but we

10

aren't there today, and today we're in the presence of the

11

Lane decision that says that when the future consequences

12

are discretionary, when they're speculative, when they

13

require certain intervening steps before there's some kind

14

of relief, that we aren't going to recognize that the case

15

continues after custody in those situations.

16

So the Court doesn't have to go nearly that far

17

in order to reach the conclusion that it ought to reach

18

today.

19

QUESTION:

Of course, in Lane we in effect said

20

that if he had -- they had asked for relief this man asked

21

for it would not have been moot.

22

MR. LAYTON:

Well,

I'm not sure of that.

think that the Lane -- that at least the way I read the

that they'd asked about the original conviction, and so -40

1

They were asking for in effect an

2

enforcement of the plea, specific enforcement of the plea

3

bargain.

MR. LAYTON:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. LAYTON:

Yes.
Which we -If -- if we treat the parole

7

revocation as the direct equivalent of a conviction, then

8

that's correct, but we haven't treated parole revocations

9

as the direct equivalent of convictions, and I think the

10

reasons have come out this afternoon, that they don't come

11

accompanied by the same kind of consequences, at least

12

under Missouri law.

13

Now, it may be that we would be in a different

14

situation if we were in a State such as, I believe New

15

Hampshire, where after you've been revoked once, you never

16

can get parole again, but we aren't in that situation.

17

All of these kind of disabilities or

18

consequences that we're talking about are remote and

contingent.

QUESTION:

Mr. Layton, the most recent

expression of this Court on this mootness is a case called

MR. LAYTON:

QUESTION:

MR. LAYTON:

Well -It's that long footnote.
I know the footnote.

I will

5

confess that I have studied it, but I am not at the moment

recalling exactly why I didn't think that I would read it

in the petitioner's favor.
It certainly does follow along from Sibron,

be read fairly to hold in petitioner's favor here.

12

there was a diversionary sentencing statute so that there

13

was no conviction on the record.

1

it was the petitioner that was seeking to have it

2

dismissed as moot, rather than the State.

3

MR. LAYTON:

That may be, plus the Minnesota

4

statute said that a conviction after a successful

5

probation, although not a conviction for future purposes,

6

can be used in calculating a criminal history category

7

under Minnesota law, but there's nothing in that decision

8

to suggest that the same would be true even under

9

Minnesota law for a parole revocation.
Again, it addresses a conviction and not a

10
11

parole revocation, and that becomes a critical distinction

12

as long as we attach to convictions certain mandatory

13

civil disabilities or consequences.

that a person must be in custody when he or she files a

petition but that once that is filed, the court may reach

3

the merits of that after they have been released or even

4

completely discharged.

5

In respect to the Minnesota decision, members of

6

the court, the petitioner owns that decision and did not

7

feel a need to cite it with specificity by virtue of a

8

reference I believe I made in the reply brief to the cases

9

relied on by the amici.

QUESTION:

But you didn't cite it, so that

suggested to me you didn't think it was -- if it was in

your favor, that it was strongly in your favor.

MR. SIMON:

I'm sorry if I didn't cite it

MR. SIMON:

Mr. Chief Justice, hearsay is, of

course, admissible in parole revocation proceedings.

7

don't deny it, but that illustrates the slender thread on

8

which this revocation hangs.

9

We

Now, the respondents have presented many

10

arguments about how this parole revocation isn't very

11

serious, how this parole revocation for forcible rape,

12

armed criminal action, and possession of crack cocaine

3

isn't very serious, and on some of them I have to agree

4

that they've scored on some of these points in respect to

5

this particular petitioner, and I'm not telling this Court

6

that every single reason why a criminal conviction remains

7

live after release applies to a parole revocation, at

8

least as to Randy Spencer.

9

But if one looks at the big picture, it is just

20

absolutely unrealistic, bordering on disingenuous, to say

21

that a parole revocation by the State of Missouri for

22

three serious felonies doesn't matter, that it doesn't
