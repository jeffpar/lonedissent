ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. SCHEMBER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. SCHEMBER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
In Harlow v. Fitzgerald, a First Amendment

12

retaliation case, the Court held that district courts

13

should protect defendants' qualified immunity through firm

14

application of the civil rules protecting defendants

15

against the burden of broad-ranging discovery and enabling

16

them promptly to seek and in substantial cases promptly to

17

obtain summary judgment.

18

The Federal rules are fully sufficient to

19

accomplish these purposes.

20

district courts can hold the plaintiff's discovery in

21

abeyance and allow defendants to inquire of the

22

plaintiffs, obtaining from the plaintiffs all evidence

23

that they have to support their contentions that they

24

exercised First Amendment rights, that the defendants knew

25

about it, that the defendants injured the plaintiffs, and

At the outset of litigation

1

that the motive for the injury was retaliation for

2

exercise -QUESTION:

3

Well, I suppose you're right that the

4

rules and the procedures are fully sufficient if we wish

5

to devote a huge amount of resources to complaints of this

6

type and to subject officials who have a claim of immunity

7

to prolonged discovery.

8

MR. SCHEMBER:

9

That's what I'm saying, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

10

If those two factors are eliminated,

11

then I suppose you're quite right, the rules are quite

12

adequate.

13

MR. SCHEMBER:

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

But the question is whether or not

15

the cost of these proceedings to the Government official

16

who wishes to assert the immunity are so high that the

17

purpose of the immunity is substantially lost.

18

MR. SCHEMBER:

19

QUESTION:

20

21

Yes.

Or am I wrong that that's the

question?
MR. SCHEMBER:

No, that's the question, but the

22

two burdens identified in Harlow are, first, the burdens

23

of trial and the burdens of broad-ranging discovery, and

24

what I'm suggesting is that at the outset of the case the

25

district court through firm application of the rules, as

1

the Court said should be done in Harlow, can protect

2

defendants against broad-ranging discovery and, indeed,

3

impose the burden on the plaintiff to come forward

4

immediately with all evidence to support the claim, all

5

elements of the claim, and if the plaintiff is unable to

6

do so immediately, the defendant is entitled to summary

7

judgment unless, of course, the plaintiff can show

8

specific facts giving rise to a reasonable likelihood that

9

discovery will uncover necessary evidence.

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Schember, speaking more generally

11

there's talk of discovery abuses not just in this case but

12

throughout the country, and the answer often is, well, the

13

district judges have it within their power to prevent

14

that, and I think a lot of people agree that's true, but

15

you have 700 district judges in the country and they just

16

react differently to this sort of problem.

17

MR. SCHEMBER:

Yes, and I think guidance from

18

this Court could tell them how to firmly apply the civil

19

rules, and the purpose of my argument is to suggest

20

precisely what should be said in that regard, and that by

21

holding the plaintiff's discovery in abeyance at the

22

outset of the case until the defendant has been entitled

23

to discover all the plaintiff's evidence, thereby placing

24

the defendant in the position of promptly seeking summary

25

judgment unless the plaintiff has sufficient evidence or

1

has a basis for seeking discovery, that is firm control

2

that prohibits excessive burden on the defendant at the

3

outset.

4

And even if the plaintiffs make a showing that

5

there's a reasonable likelihood that discovery will

6

uncover evidence supporting their claims the district

7

court still could hold their discovery in abeyance if the

8

defendant wished to assert a defense under Mount Healthy

9

Board of Education v. Doyle, saying even if I -- we were

10

substantially motivated by hostility to the plaintiff's

11

exercise of constitutional rights, nonetheless we would

12

have taken the same action in any event, and if defendants

13

come forward with sufficient evidence to establish that

14

defense, they are entitled immediately to summary judgment

15

on that ground unless, of course, plaintiff immediately

16

can present admissible evidence rebutting that, or, again,

17

make a showing that there are facts giving rise to a

18

reasonable likelihood that discovery --

19

QUESTION:

When you're talking about intent,

20

though, that's a very difficult issue to get summary

21

judgment on, because it's the subjective state of

22

someone's mind, and it's just something that ordinarily it

23

goes to a trier of fact, I think.

24

MR. SCHEMBER:

25

Well, certainly the Harlow court

commented on that with respect to the subject of general

bad faith and malice.

2

specific intent of unconstitutional animus I would suggest

3

is narrower.

4

show I exercised First Amendment rights and the defendant

5

knew about it, and discovery as to that inquiry certainly

6

is narrower than whether the defendant's a bad person, a

7

malicious person, someone who customarily is mean to

8

people, that type of thing.

9

However, inquiry as to the

For example, the plaintiff certainly has to

QUESTION:

It still gets you into subjective

10

investigations, which is really what we tried to put

11

behind us in Harlow.

12

MR. SCHEMBER:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

Well --

I mean, we really tried to make this

an objective inquiry.
MR. SCHEMBER:

Well, the Court certainly said

16

that qualified immunity is to be based upon a showing --

17

on the fact that a -- no violation of clearly established

18

law exists, but, of course, retaliation for exercise of

19

First Amendment rights, or discrimination on the basis of

20

race or sex was clearly -- is clearly established

21

constitutional law.

22

QUESTION:

That clearly established law

23

principle was simply the device which would enable an

24

objective determination to be made in Harlow.

25

What this case requires, if we're to follow the

1

philosophy of Harlow, is some other device that would

2

likewise produce an objective test rather than a

3

subjective one.

4

Now, I'm not sure that what the D.C. Circuit

5

majority did here does that.

6

by clear and convincing evidence, but Judge Silberman's

7

test would certainly do that.

8

MR. SCHEMBER:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

It's still a subjective test

Well, but Justice --

Given these facts, could a reasonable

person have taken this action.
MR. SCHEMBER:

If so, end of the matter.

Yes, that certainly would do

12

that, but that would be effectively the end of claims that

13

are based upon the subjective intent and, if we are to

14

eliminate entirely claims that are based upon proving the

15

unconstitutional animus --

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Just as in Harlow we eliminated

claims that were based upon subjective intent.
MR. SCHEMBER:

General malice, but Harlow cannot

19

be read for the proposition that First Amendment

20

retaliation cases cannot go forward, period.

21

First Amendment retaliation case, and what the Court said

22

in that case is, firmly apply the civil rules in order to

23

make sure that there's no broad-ranging discovery and to

24

make sure that there's early determination by summary

25

judgment, rather than a long-delayed trial in an

Harlow was a

1

insubstantial case.

2

It cannot -- I do not believe Harlow can be read

3

to foreclose First Amendment retaliation cases,

not been understood,

5

for that proposition.

QUESTION:

I don't believe,

and it has

since then,

It can surely be read as an attempt

7

by this Court to make the section 1983 inquiry an

8

objective inquiry rather than a subjective one.

that was the whole driving force behind Harlow.

to stand

MR. SCHEMBER:

Surely

Well, that was a Bivens inquiry.

11

That was a Bivens case rather than a section 1983 case,

but yes,

That part of the test didn't make any

QUESTION:

Why -- you can always make this claim

17

that what was done was done with a -- with an intent to

18

deprive me of a constitutional right.

MR. SCHEMBER:

QUESTION:

21

MR. SCHEMBER:

Well,

it can't always be --

It can't always be proven.
Well,

I suppose it can always be

22

asserted, but the firm application of the rules will

23

ferret out baseless assertions if the assertion is

24

baseless.

May I ask,

in this case, what would

happen if the trial judge let the plaintiff take the

2

deposition of the defendant and she testified that she

3

merely gave the materials to the brother-in-law, or

4

whatever he was, as a matter of convenience, she knew all

5

about his First Amendment activities, but she didn't hold

6

a grudge against him, and that's all she said.

7

What should the district judge do with the case,

8

and then there's a motion for summary judgment.

9

nothing substantiating it except his belief that she acted

10
11

There's

improperly.
MR. SCHEMBER:

Well, but there would be -- the

12

motion should be denied for the following reason.

13

Implicit in -- certainly we wouldn't ignore what she said

14

already on the subject, and that is that she doesn't think

15

prisoners have any rights, and that prisoners bound for a

16

Federal penitentiary don't have any right to any property

17

at all, and that is not a reasonable assertion, the idea

18

that there are no circumstances in which any Federal

19

prisoner has any right to possess any legal papers, no

20

matter what their need might be for pending litigation --

21

QUESTION:

Yes, but --

22

MR. SCHEMBER:

QUESTION:

-- is not a reasonable --

That may be her belief, but she may

24

say with respect to the transactions at issue in this

25

case, I did it as -- purely as a matter of convenience,

1

and even though that's my belief, I wasn't trying to

2

discipline him.

3

I just was going about my work.

MR. SCHEMBER:

If that were a reasonable belief,

4

then in theory it would be a defense.

However, it is not

5

a reasonable basis for her to have so acted.
In Waters v. Churchill the Court talked about

6

7

the problem of inadvertent or mistaken violation of First

8

Amendment rights and said that there should be inquiry as

9

to whether the so-called mistake in the case -- or the

10

genuine mistake -- was a reasonable mistake.
QUESTION:

11

This was no mistake.

What she did

12

with his papers or whatever they were, nobody fights about

13

that.

14

she did is not in dispute, is it?

15

MR. SCHEMBER:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

That's clear, isn't it, the facts?

Actually what

No, it's not.

The only dispute is what her reason

for doing it was.
MR. SCHEMBER:

Yes, and implicit in her reason,

19

certainly the facts indicate that she intended to deprive

20

him totally of these papers and all of his property.

21

There's no doubt about that.

22

supposedly that he wasn't entitled to have them at all,

23

but that was not a reasonable belief.

24

proper basis for a Mount Healthy defense.

intended totally to deprive him of his papers?

2

MR. SCHEMBER:

3

QUESTION:

Yes.

I thought she merely adopted a more

4

convenient way of getting them delivered to their

destination.

MR. SCHEMBER:

QUESTION:

8

No, not at all.

Namely, sending them through the

brother-in-law.
MR. SCHEMBER:

9

It was her belief --no.

It was

10

her belief that the prisoners were not -- in the Federal

11

penitentiary were not entitled to any property at all.

12

QUESTION:

Well --

13

MR. SCHEMBER:

That was unreasonable belief.

14

She diverted it outside the system so that he wouldn't get

Then credibility determinations

20

basically are going to swallow up the immunity rule, I

21

suppose, if the summary judgment stays.

22

MR. SCHEMBER:

Well, the plaintiff has to have

23

admissible evidence that proves the elements of the case

24

and yes, if it does come down to a question of whether or

25

not the plaintiff is credible in assertings, for example,

a defendant's admission that's involved here

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. SCHEMBER:

4

-- then yes, it does come down to

that, yes.
QUESTION:

5
6

But I mean, if you --

Do you think this case is unusual or

remarkable in that respect?
MR. SCHEMBER:

7

Quite unusual, yes, because what

8

we have here is a fairly high-ranking prison official

9

dealing directly one-on-one with a prisoner.

She wasn't a

10

prison guard, for example, and yes, it is rather unusual

11

in this --

QUESTION:

Well, how --

13

QUESTION:

Well, wouldn't you -- I'm sorry.

14

MR. SCHEMBER:

15

QUESTION:

-- regard.

How would you compare it to other

16

cases?

You said, don't worry because this discovery is

17

going to be limited and there's going to be summary

18

judgment, but you say in this case, if I understand you

19

right, this one's got to go to trial.
MR. SCHEMBER:

20

Yes, because here there is

21

admissible evidence proving the elements of the claim,

22

including defendant's admissions from this official to the

23

plaintiff.

24
25

QUESTION:

And I suppose you would say the same

thing about that Martin case and about Martin v. Malhoyt,

another D.C. Circuit case, so I'm trying to see where

2

there is a match.

I think there is none.

For the Harlow, when you're talking about the

3
4

legal standard, then we have clearly established law.

5

Here, on the surface everything looks lawful.

6

it unlawful is a clearly unconstitutional design, either

7

race discrimination, First Amendment violation, but on the

8

surface everything looks okay.
MR. SCHEMBER:

9
0

What makes

Well, it's undisputed that the

facts of the case state a violation of District of

11

Columbia common law, not that I'm suggesting that that

12

necessarily bears directly on the question of the

3

availability of the constitutional cause of action, but it

4

certainly bears upon the reasonableness of the -- of her

5

action.

6

This is an instance where there was injury

7

inflicted.

8

to have been in violation of the District of Columbia

9

common law and also there is sufficient evidence from

20

which the jury could find that unconstitutional animus

2

motivated it, and it is in the public interest, even if

22

there could be a recovery under a common law conversion

claim that the First Amendment claim go forward and that

24

the plaintiff be allowed to prove that if hostility to

exercise First Amendment rights was --

1

2

Well then, I gather what you're

saying is --

3

MR. SCHEMBER:

4

QUESTION:

--he can prove it.

-- that there shouldn't be any match

5

on the subjective intent side to what this Court has

6

installed on the -- purely on the what-the-law-is side in

7

Harlow.
MR. SCHEMBER:

8

9

Well, the question of match, I

don't think I'm following -QUESTION:

10

In other words, Harlow inserted a

11

test, and it is that it's not only that there was a

12

violation of law, and it's not only that the law was

13

established, but it must be clearly established.

14

MR. SCHEMBER:

15

QUESTION:

Right.

Now you're saying, but where the law

16

would not be in doubt if the motive is unconstitutional,

17

then there is no -- nothing special for these official --

18

officials.
MR. SCHEMBER:

19

There should not be, I am arguing

20

to the Court, for the reasons that a clear and convincing

21

evidence rule would not properly balance defendant's needs

22

for immunity against the countervailing interests, which

23

are the need to deter officials from violating

24

constitutional rights, and the need to redress the

25

victims.

If we had a situation where Government employees

1

2

could have their careers ruined by supervisors who

3

retaliate against them for their exercise of speech off-

4

duty on matters of public concern, the -- and if those

5

employees were not able to obtain any redress unless they

6

could prove their claims by clear and convincing evidence,

7

the chilling effect on Government employees' speech would

8

be contrary to the public interest.

9

QUESTION:

Why is this any different from Harlow

10

in this respect:

11

in Harlow that you're saying to us now, namely, this can

12

be handled by pretrial discovery if -- so long as you

13

assert that, number 1, the Constitution was violated, and

14

number 2, the officer knew he was violating the

15

Constitution?

16

why couldn't we have said the same thing

Never mind that it wasn't clearly established,

17

he knew he was violating the Constitution, and that was

18

his intent.

19

discovery, and if you can't show that was his intent, we

20

just simply dismiss the case.

What's the problem?

Just have pretrial

21

But we didn't take that course in Harlow.

MR. SCHEMBER:

different.

whether you should hold in a Bivens action the more

knowledgeable official liable for the same action where,

That's the -- under Mount Healthy, that's what the

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

Petitioner's counsel has just said that in his

view the gravamen of his position is that there needn't be

cases, we're going to put public officials through

2

discovery, past summary judgment, and into trial, and that

3

will cause all of the harm to effective government and all

4

of the harm to the public interest that this Court in

5

Harlow designed a rule to prohibit, and I think he's quite

6

wrong to say that we can simply rely on the normal rules

7

to take care of the case.
QUESTION:

8

9

But isn't it true that Harlow dealt

with the special problem of qualified immunity, and your

10

position in this case, even if there's no qualified

11

immunity defense interposed, you'd still make the same

12

arguments.
MR. SMITH:

13

Well, on the merits we would, but

14

since we did interpose qualified immunity, Your Honor,

15

there are two parts to the qualified immunity.
QUESTION:

16

But it seems to me the case really is

17

about the merits, because if the defendant here did what

18

was alleged, there really isn't a basis for qualified

19

immunity.

20

there's no cause of action.

On the other hand, if the defendant is correct,

MR. SMITH:

21

I guess I disagree with that, Your

she took is going to be upheld under the qualified

action at all.

She doesn't need an affirmative defense.

MR. SMITH:

11

That is true.

That is true, but

12

good faith immunity is called, I think, Your Honor, good

13

faith immunity precisely because it's designed to assure

14

public officials that if they act in good faith, as Harlow

15

said, cases against them will be promptly dismissed,

16

17

QUESTION:

No, I don't think that's right.

Harlow it's even if they acted in bad faith and for malice

19

and all these other bad motives, if the right wasn't

clearly established at the time, the plaintiff still

loses.

22

It's a question of the state of the law at the time of the

conduct.

It's not a question of subjective good faith.

Absolutely, Your Honor.

qualified immunity.

I'd like to respond to something Justice Scalia

said, though.

He said that in Harlow we had found a

21

mechanism for making sure we didn't have to have an

22

inquiry into the knowledge part.

is a mechanism to make sure that we don't have subjective

inquiries into the intent part, because that can do just

as much damage to the purposes of the Harlow decision as

inquiries into the knowledge of the law.
QUESTION:

2

But it isn't an intent part and a

3

knowledge part.

There are two discrete kinds of wrongful

4

acts.

5

the law had been violated and the Court's answer was,

6

there's qualified immunity unless that law was clearly

7

established.

In the Harlow thing it was a question of whether

Now, here, there isn't any question that if the

8

9

motive that's alleged exists, what was done was terribly

10

unlawful, so the two -- you can't just mix them together

11

and say they're all part of the same kind of tortious

12

conduct.

13

the other is, what was in my head, because if one thing

14

was in my head, then I acted in violation of the law, if

15

another thing was, I didn't, so they're two different

16

kinds of torts.

17

One is, did I act in violation of the law, and

MR. SMITH:

They are two different things, Your

18

Honor, but I would try to argue to you they're both part

19

of the good faith immunity, and before Harlow the Court

20

said there were two parts to the inquiry, one that the

21

Court called subjective, and one that the Court called

22

objective, but they both had to do with the state of the

23

mind of the official.

24

the mind of the official, the other is whether or not

25

there's improper intent.

to make intent irrelevant.

QUESTION:

We just want to know, was this

Right.
But in the kind of tort we're talking

about here, the intent is everything.

9

MR. SMITH:

You can't make it

Oh, I wasn't trying to make it

10

irrelevant, Your Honor.

I'm trying to make it part of the

11

qualified immunity inquiry and find a way to assure that

12

the qualified immunity will be given to the official

13

without having to go through discovery and trial, and my

14

point is that if you don't have some kind of what Justice

15

Scalia was calling a special mechanism, nearly every one

16

of these cases where improper intent is alleged is going

17

to have to go through discovery and trial, bringing about

18

all of the harm that Harlow was designed to prohibit.

19

That's the point that I'm trying to make, and we

20

need to find, again to use Justice Scalia's words, I think

21

a mechanism for assuring that what the Court said in

22

Harlow should not occur -- a subjective inquiry -- will

23

not occur here either.

MR. SMITH:

Well, Harlow, Wyatt, I would cite

Woodby v. INS, where the Court adopted a clear and

action like this one, if we don't have some such mechanism

as clear and convincing, as a threshold standard, that for

8

practical purposes summary judgment will not be granted

9

and qualified immunity will be a dead letter.

Do you have

any factual evidence in the record to that effect?

have an empirical basis to say that what you're saying is

together, they do say one important thing.

We have an explosion of cases in this area.

them are ultimately determined to be nonmeritorious, but

important point, I think, is that the policy consideration

First of all, thousands of cases

10

that drove Harlow was that if you permit cases like this

11

to proceed, you will dampen the ardor of public officials.

12

Unless public officials are certain that these

13

insubstantial suits are going to be promptly dismissed

14

before discovery and trial, the risk is great, the Harlow

15

court said, that these public officials are not going to

16

be unflinching in their duties, and at a given prison, it

would only take one such claim to do that kind of harm.

Obviously, you have to first be persuaded that some kind

of heightened standard is needed in order to address the

4

I would like just to take the last few moments,

with the Court's permission, to tick off what I think are

6

four reasons why clear and convincing is the right kind of

7

heightened standard to use in these cases.

8

9

First of all, and this will be abbreviated, as
Judge Williams said in his opinion, this is a situation

10

where we had asymmetry in the risk of error.

11

say, the Court has already determined in Harlow itself

12

that some meritorious cases must be turned away in order

13

to serve the greater good of ensuring that insubstantial

14

cases will be promptly dismissed, and it's in an asymmetry

15

of error situation the Court has often adopted clear and

16

convincing.

17

That is to

His second reason was that this is a case where,

18

just to use his words, motive is easy to allege and hard

19

to disprove.

20

of the doubt for public officials, and that's a point the

21

Court made in Harlow itself, where it said at page 814,

22

note 23, dishonest or vindictive motives are readily

23

attributed and as readily believed, actually raising the

24

specter that we may have public officials who are

Could I mention the other two reasons, though?

One is that I think you've done this in analogous

ago as the United States v. Chemical case and reaffirmed

2

in Armstrong, which is, there should be a presumption of

3

regularity to validate decisions of public officials in

the absence -- and this was the key phrase, I think -- in

5

the absence of clear evidence to the contrary.
It seems to me that, too, supports the view that

6

7

clear and convincing is the right kind of heightened

8

standard to use here, although I'll say in response to

9

something Justice Breyer said our primary point is that

something has to be done to assure public officials that

11

these insubstantial claims will not put them through

I do think it's better than the

the Department have the burden of coming in with the

doesn't seem like that much compared to the number of

don't know how many deal with the motive, and we don't

know whether the best way is to have a higher proof on the

What we're proposing here is a

QUESTION:

What if the trial judge in this case

but nevertheless I'm concerned about the very problem

you're all discussing here?

9

well, since the qualified immunity defense isn't

Would they have just said,

available, well, just too bad?

11

MR. MINEAR:

Well, we do think that this rule

12

ought to be applied as part of the qualified immunity

13

defense, and let me explain how that would work, and I

14

think the easiest way to focus on this is to imagine a

15

case that's -- in which the jury is being instructed --

16

let's suppose we've gotten past summary judgment.

17

The jury will be instructed that the plaintiff

18

has to come forward and prove his constitutional claim and

19

then the jury will be instructed, if you find that that

20

claim is proved by a preponderance of the evidence, then

21

you must consider the defendant's qualified immunity

22

defense and, accepting your hypothetical, Justice Stevens,

23

that the -- there's a clearly established rule, what we're

24

asking, that there be an additional instruction that the

basis for believing that the officer had an improper

intent.
Now, we're suggesting, of course, that this same

standard should apply at the summary judgment stage as

6

Wouldn't there have had to have been

a firm basis for believing they had the intent if the --

8

in order for the plaintiff to make out the affirmative

9

case?

10

MR. MINEAR:

No.

That is the difference with

11

the clear and convincing standard.

Clear and convincing

12

evidence is evidence sufficient to give the jury a firm

13

belief of an improper motive.

14

QUESTION:

That's very good as well as a charge

15

to the jury, Mr. Minear, but how does a judge on a summary

16

judgment stage -- is there some way he can distinguish

17

between a claim that is supported by a preponderance of

18

the evidence but not by clear and convincing evidence?

19

MR. MINEAR:

Yes, we think that he can, and he

20

has to ask the same question.

He applies that standard of

21

proof that -- the clear and convincing standard in

22

determining the summary judgment motion, much as took

23

place in Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, where he looks at the

24

factual question through the prism of the appropriate

25

standard, and that is what we're suggesting is appropriate

here.
And that standard is necessary, we submit,

2

3

because otherwise there will always be these types of

4

claims in which improper motive can be alleged based

5

merely on inference and, because the judge must credit the

6

inferences in favor of a nonmoving party, these cases will

7

go on and be subjected to a jury trial even though it's

8

very unlikely that they will proceed, or that they will

9

produce a verdict, and that is something that we do have

10

statistics on.
We do know that only 1 percent of the

11
12

criminal -- of the prisoner petition cases ultimately

13

result in court-ordered relief for the prisoner out of the

14

40,000 cases that the district courts are charged with

15

handling, and that seems to me that is significant.

universe we're most concerned about, the 3 percent.

2

MR. MINEAR:

3

also -- not just the 3 percent.

4

also concerned about those cases in which there's

5

extensive discovery where a motion for summary judgment is

6

ultimately granted after the plaintiff has conducted

7

deposition after deposition and the court concludes that

8

in fact there is not sufficient factual evidence to

9

support the claim.

QUESTION:

MR. MINEAR:

Well, we think that in fact Justice

5

Ginsburg in the court of appeals has suggested an

6

appropriate approach with regard to discovery, and as a

7

separate matter he has suggested that discovery should not

8

go forward unless it's likely to produce sufficient

9

evidence to achieve the desired result at trial.

20

In other words, the plaintiff has to produce

some evidence of an improper motive and, in addition, must

show that there's a reasonable likelihood that he can

produce evidence through discovery that will --

The plaintiff is obligated when he submits his

In a case such as this, I think it's quite clear

that the intended deposition of Ms. Britton is unlikely to
