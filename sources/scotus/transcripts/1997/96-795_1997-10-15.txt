ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN D. SHAWE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. SHAWE:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Picking up on the commentary in Curtin Matheson,

11

12

this case brings to the Court's attention the issue of

13

whether deference to the board is owing when the board

14

applies the same standard to three different approaches to

15

challenging a union's continuing majority status.

16

In Curtin Matheson this Court acknowledged the

17

board's oft-articulated standard that an employer can

18

withdraw recognition from an incumbent union if 1) the

19

union has in fact lost its majority status, or 2) the

20

employer has, based on objective considerations,

21

reasonable grounds to doubt the union's continued majority

22

status.

23

The second test supposedly can be satisfied by a

24

lower threshold of proof, although the board typically

25

requires clear, cogent, concise articulations by

1

individual employees disaffected totalling a majority, or

2

a head count.

3

But conducting a secret ballot poll is not the

4

same as withdrawing recognition.

5

withdrawal of recognition the employer has preempted any

6

vote.

7

consistent with the board's Struksnes standards permits of

8

the possibility that a majority will vote in favor of

9

continued union representation, and the board in Texas

10

Petrochemicals and its brief disclaims any interest or

11

desire to do away with employer polls.

12

Obviously, in the

In contrast, a secret ballot poll assuming fairness

The board's standard for permitting an employer

13

to take the grave and precipitous step of withdrawing

14

recognition should not at the same time be applied in the

15

contradictory context of secret ballot polling.

16

QUESTION:

Well, why is it contradictory?

I

17

mean, I thought there was a rational structure for all of

18

this along the following lines:

19

The board says, we're at the point at which the

20

presumption is no longer absolute.

21

is going to be given three options, subject to the same

22

condition, probable cause to believe.

23

The employer in effect

The three conditions, the three options,

24

however, have varying risks.

If the employer simply

25

withdraws recognition and turns out to be wrong, the

2

repercussions are presumably going to be very great.
If the employer asks for an election, perhaps

3

the repercussions may not be so great, but they're going

4

to be serious.

5

If the employer decides to take a poll, the

6

repercussions -- and loses, the repercussions perhaps will

7

not be quite so great.

8

9

That's not quite so disruptive.

What is irrational about saying, subject to the
same fact premise, the employer is going to be given an

10

option of going A, B, or C, depending on the degree of

11

risk that the employer wants to run if the employer turns

12

out to be wrong?

13

MR. SHAWE:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. SHAWE:

Well, I don't -How is that irrational?
No, I don't -- I think it's not

16

rational, given the predisposition of the board -- the

17

court, me, the -- everyone, that a poll or an election is

18

a much, much better preferred test to measure employee

19

sentiment than what is -- what has been for 40 years the

20

board's articulated standard in Celanese that an employer

21

can withdraw without a poll.

22

QUESTION:

I understood your claim to be here --

23

if -- perhaps it's a claim of irrational -- that the

24

board's requirements for taking a poll are so stringent

25

that they almost make a poll unnecessary.

MR. SHAWE:

1

Well, they make it irrelevant, a

2

legally irrelevant act, the board's regulatory scheme that

3

accepts as valid a secret ballot poll only, and only if

4

the employer has so much evidence before taking the poll

5

that it could have withdrawn recognition without it.
QUESTION:

6

Well, are you saying that if the --

7

if the standard of cause that were applied to each of

8

these three options were something less than what you

9

characterize as the head count, that there would be

10

nothing irrational, nothing to -- nothing really to object

11

to in having the three options subject to the same factual

12

condition?

3

MR. SHAWE:

Well, I suppose a reasonable doubt,

4

if it were different from a head count and, indeed, it

5

were applied as if it were the totality of the

6

circumstances, perhaps the complaint wouldn't be so

7

vehement, but --

MR. SHAWE:

1

Because what the board has elevated

2

has valued in allowing an employer to withdraw recognition

3

with or without a poll because the same standard applies,

4

or even processing the favored RM petition, the management

5

petition, is a head count, and -QUESTION:

6

But suppose the same standard didn't

apply, isn't your real complaint here that reasonable

Without a head count.
That's clearly a complaint, yes,

sir.
QUESTION:

15

Well, isn't it the essential

16

complaint, because if they -- if they treated reasonable

17

doubt as reasonable doubt, you would have the three-stage

18

process that Justice Souter is talking about, the three

19

different ways.

QUESTION:

1

Well, but you may have a gripe with

2

the board that they set it up that way, but that's a very

3

different thing from saying that it's irrational to the

4

point that a court would be authorized to strike it down.

Well, the reason that it's

irrational, I suggest, is that it is internally

put it they are insisting on a head count.

13

reason?

14

MR. SHAWE:

No.

Isn't that the

I think that the reason that

15

the board is insisting on it is that they are nervous

16

about withdrawals of recognition, appropriately so, and

17

would prefer, as they have acknowledged, and all would

18

agree, that the RM petition be utilized as the standard,

19

and what they have done is, I think mistakenly in U.S.

20

Gypsum, after 20 years of not doing it in 1966 said we are

21

going to have the same elevated standard for processing an

22

RM petition as we have to permit an employer to withdraw

recognition without any poll whatsoever, and --

withdrawal of recognition, the poll, the secret ballot,

that reasonable doubt must be given a different definition

accepted by the Court as a head count, that I won't

prevail in this case.

3

QUESTION:

Are you making two distinct

arguments, and is -- one, as I hear it, seems to be purely

comparative.

10

That is, suppose the board said, we're

So all we have is the poll and what's been

Suppose we took out what you say is a glaring
inconsistency in no more --

11

MR. SHAWE:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

That's

No more withdrawals?
Yes.

Then what would your case be,

if we had only the poll?
MR. SHAWE:

Well, if the board continued to

15

adhere to its elevated standard to process an RM petition,

16

then I would continue to insist on the employer's right to

17

conduct the poll.

18

If, however, the board accepted its own general

19

counsel's recommendation in the Chelsea Industries case --

20

that was one of the cases lodged by the board in

21

opposition to our cert petition.

22

The board's general counsel, who's obviously

23

much more familiar with this process than currently anyone

24

else, has himself indicated -- and I have the lodging

25

where he says that, on page 9, the board's current policy,
11

(800) FOR DEPO

1

which applies the triple standard to the RM petition, to

2

the poll, and to the withdrawal of recognition without any

3

election, the board's current policy does little to

4

encourage employers to act in accordance with what the

5

Supreme Court has long thought to be the board's own view,

6

namely that even after the certification year has passed,

7

the better practice is for the employer with doubts to

8

keep bargaining and petition -- the RM petition -- the

9

board for a new election, citing the Ray Brooks case, the

10

954 case that the Supreme Court heard after the -- after

11
12

reading the Celanese decision.
So rather, says the general counsel to the

3

board, rather the Celanese rule, which he is proposing be

4

eliminated -- that's your suggestion -- encourages

5

employers to engage in self-help measures, and thereby to

6

engage in potentially unlawful withdrawal of recognition

7

rather than the, quote, better practice of proceeding to a

8

board vote with the injuries to industrial peace and

9

protracted litigation, which is always the result --

20

22

QUESTION:

But I still don't have a clear answer

from you to my question.
To the extent that you're complaining about a

23

comparison being irrational, isn't that objection at least

24

taken away if, say, the board was to respond, they said,

25

fine, we've always been nervous about these unilateral

1

withdrawals.

We just won't allow them any more.

2

Suppose you didn't have that in your case, and

3

all you had was the poll and the RM election governed by

4

the same standard, would you have any complaint?

5

MR. SHAWE:

No.

I'd have a lot less complaint,

6

but in my view the RM petition, in order to make it

7

available, must be subscribed to in a much lower standard

8

than the one that's currently in place, which does require

9

still a head count in order for the board -QUESTION:

10
11

I'm sorry, now you're losing me.

You - -

12

MR. SHAWE:

13

QUESTION:

Right.
I thought I understood your first

14

argument that if they didn't permit unilateral withdrawal,

15

you would not have a complaint, but now you seem to be

16

saying even if they didn't --

17

MR. SHAWE:

If they do not honor what's called a

18

good faith doubt, which is a totality of the

19

circumstances, still required a head count applicable to

20

the RM petition, and the conduct of a poll before the poll

21

would be validated, yes, I would still object because the

22

good faith doubt would be obliterated within the meaning

23

of what those words mean, at least what the Court has

24

always assumed the board to have meant when it registers

25

good faith doubt.

1

QUESTION:

Then why couldn't the board say, this

2

is our test and we want it to be a tight one because it's

3

important to give the union a chance to operate, and

4

that's why we have the 1-year free, and then we have the

5

rebuttable presumption.

6

So to keep that tight we have to have a

7

stringent standard of what we must show before we'll let

8

you get an election or take a poll.

9

illogical about that?

10

MR. SHAWE:

What would be

Well, the reason for that is that it

11

seems to me the best way to resolve a doubt is to have a

12

poll rather than to require the employer to submit

13

evidence in advance --

14

QUESTION:

But the board's rule is you have to

15

have more than a doubt.

16

you seem to be saying that that would not be a permissible

17

construction of the statute.

18
19
20
21
22

MR. SHAWE:

Is that what -- tell me what --

That would not be a permissible

construction of good faith doubt, correct.
QUESTION:

But the good faith doubt doesn't come

from the act.
MR. SHAWE:

No, it comes from the board, and if

23

the board says that a good faith doubt standard will apply

24

to RM petitions and to polls, then the head count would be

25

impermissible as the test to determine whether or not

either the poll or the RM petition's processing should go

forward.

MR. SHAWE:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. SHAWE:

Yes, sir.
--a good faith reasonable doubt.
Yes.
Based on what?
Based on the six or seven employees

10

credited by the board claiming disaffection from the

11

union, several other statements from other employees not

12

accepted by the board, but nonetheless indicating a lack

13

of interest or support for the union, the statement of a

14

night shift employee who said, all five or six night shift

15

employees do not favor the union and, most importantly,

16

the comment by Ron Mohr, the shop steward and union

17

committeeman, who says to the employer that, with you as

18

the boss, the new company, if a vote were taken, the

19

people would not support the union.

20

people want the union with you as the boss.

21

QUESTION:

I don't think the

Is there any theory you can advance

22

to tell us that that should constitute good faith doubt in

23

the context of taking the poll, even though it might not

24

be for withdrawal of recognition?

MR. SHAWE:

Yes, because the -- what the board

has articulated as elevated, as favored, are individual

2

names.

3

people that I think would vote against the union, the

4

board would prefer that.

5

Had Mr. Mohr said, and here are the names of the

They'd like that.

But that's a remarkable elevation when everyone

6

would agree that a better resolution of true employee

7

sentiment would not be Mr. Mohr's articulation of here's

8

the list over here, and here's the list over here, but

9

rather to allow all the people vote in secret, and that's

10

what happened here.
They voted in secret.

11

There is a specific

12

finding that there was a noncoercive setting, that the

13

union had notice, the union lodged no protest over the

14

vote, nor made any comment concerning it.

employees participated.

I can't imagine a better test of

here.

I'm sorry.

Mr. Shawe, isn't one

21

answer to the objection that you're making -- which I have

22

to say in the Mohr example is I think a very serious

23

objection, but isn't one answer to it this:

24
25

Sure, the best way to find out what's really
going on is to have an election.

We agree.

(800) FOR DEPO

But we want

1

2

the standard for calling the election to be high.
We want the standard of doubt to be a high one

3

because there's another value involved, and the fact is

4

the promotion of industrial peace and the promotion of

5

stability is going to be served over the long haul by

6

fewer elections rather than more elections, and that's why

7

we're going to have a high standard, maybe not to the

8

point of requiring Mohr to say, A, B, C, D, and E told me,

9

but at least to the point of requiring Mohr to say, I have

10

actually talked to the men, not naming them, and I find

11

that they are affirmatively disclaiming any desire at this

12

MR. SHAWE:

Well, you know, one of the things

that's -- constantly crops up in the board's brief is the

issue of remand, because both you and Justice Ginsburg now

assume, let's assume we don't have withdrawals of

9

recognition for the moment, without a poll, which is

10
11

clearly not the rule.
It may be a wise rule, but it's not the rule,

12

and when they apply, the board applies to the polling

standard and the RM standard the same standard that they

14

would apply to an employer without any election, to do

exactly the same thing, and just litigate the case for a

explains as -- in its own brief, which is that many

employers, as you said, acting in good faith, and wishing

to convey that good faith to their employees, would not

wish to withdraw recognition from a union unless they

could first confirm whether or not the union in fact lacks

MR. SHAWE:

seven is enough for anything, and what they've done in the

QUESTION:

Sure, and maybe -- maybe a court

would hold that it is reasonable, given the need for

described its standard as rigorous, as stringent.
QUESTION:

telling us in any more detail, what exactly those words

mean.

15

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

Well, to be sure,

I mean, in

this context no matter what the standard the board picks,

17

that standard is going to be fact-specific in its

application, and it's not possible to give a global

19

explanation for how it's applied in every case.

20

Sometimes a head count is enough, sometimes it's

21

required because the employer has no especially probative

Just like actual malice, the term that the board

would be, if it's that tough a standard, what sense does

it make to say you have to know that your majority of your

already know it.

That's the question I think that some

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

Here's why it makes sense.

If there's one principle that this Court has observed

20

continuously over the years, it is that we should rely on

21

the employees themselves rather than on their employers to

22

take the initiative in second-guessing whether or not the

23

union that the employees have chosen should continue to

24

exist in the workplace, and it is true that --

Excuse me.

We've said that?

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

1

Yes, you have.

You -- in

2

Auciello and Fall River, in Brooks, this Court has pointed

3

out that the people that we principally rely on to rebut

4

the presumption of continuing majority status are the

5

employees who have chosen this union.
In some circumstances the employer may have

6

7

evidence that would give him the right either of

8

withdrawal recognition, take a poll or conduct an RM

9

election, but there is nothing in the National Labor

10

Relations Act that confers on the employers an additional

11

collateral right to go out and seek more evidence to try

12

to withdraw recognition from a union.

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

I -- what -- the primary

19

question, as I understand your question, is why does the

20

board still permits unilateral withdrawals of recognition,

21

given that you have the RM election device, or is your

22

question something else?

1

second, if it permits it, why doesn't it have a much

2

tighter standard for that?

3

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

Well, the answer to your

4

first question is, it's largely a question of historical

5

evolution of the labor laws.

6

It was not until the Taft-Hartley Act of 1948

7

that there were RM elections and/or that there were

8

decertification elections.

9

Those were added by that.

Before then, effectively the only way that a

10

union could ever get decertified was if an employer

11

withdrew recognition, and because of that, the board --

12

QUESTION:

Gee, I thought it was an unfair labor

13

practice for an employer to continue to bargain with a

14

union that he knows no longer represents the majority.

15

Can he continue to deal with a union that he knows is not

16

supported by a majority of the --

17

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

I'm not aware of a single

18

case in which any employer has been found guilty of a

19

violation of section 882 by virtue of that, because in

20

fact what he has to have is incontrovertible evidence.

21

If he has a doubt about that, though, the

22

important thing is that he can go to the board and seek an

23

RM election if he wants to preserve his rights.

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

That is correct.

On this

Well, you seem to take the position

14

that what's required for unilateral nonrecognition of the

15

union and calling for a poll of the employees is virtually

16

the same thing, and yet in the Auciello case from this

17

Court, which isn't that old, this Court said that the

18

evidence required to demonstrate that a union has lost

19

majority support is greater than that required to assert

20

good faith doubt.

We purported to Auciello to lay out what this

tripartite framework is and, in fact, it's being applied

as a two-part framework.

1

the standards required in the withdrawal context and the

2

polling context.

3

that permit an employer to take any action, any unilateral

4

action at all, and those are a demonstration of actual

5

loss of majority support, and what the board has called

6

reasonable doubt.

7

What it addressed are the two standards

No one's arguing about the first of those in

8

this case.

What we're arguing about is whether it's

9

rational for the board to apply the same reasonable doubt

10

standard in the polling context as it is in the withdrawal

11

context, and the reason it's rational is because there are

12

some contexts in which a good faith employer might benefit

13

from taking a poll even if he thinks he has some sketchy

14

information suggesting the majority of employees no longer

15

support the union.

16

In that context, it makes a lot of sense for him

17

just to maintain workplace goodwill to take the poll

18

before going the extra yard and withdrawing recognition.

QUESTION:

could you

answer my question with assurance one way or the other?

4
5

Based on what it has said,

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

I'm not sure that I could

answer your question with assurance one way or the other.
I do know that the board requires a particularly

6

7

strong showing of nonsupport for a union,

8

naturally skeptical to rely on certain kinds of evidence,

9

and reports of colleagues' views in the workplace,

and the board is

and the

10

reason it is is that often when these views trickle up to

11

the employer they are the result of a concerted effort by

12

some of the employees to throw out the union.

13

that --

QUESTION:

Well,

and ask himself,

the employer use?

Remember

if the employer can't go out

and if the board is skeptical of views

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

then what kind of evidence can

Well,

again,

there will often

19

be the case -- there will often be circumstances in which

20

the employer will not have a sufficient evidentiary basis,

21

and that that's the circumstance in which the board has

22

put the burden on the employees to look after their own

23

rights in filing a decertification --

Yes, but the board has said we will

but certainly there's got to be some counter to it.

2

can't just be an empty thing, and yet it seems that the

3

board -- if it won't allow the employer to go out and ask,

4

and it doesn't accept the kind of evidence that you just

5

referred to, it's almost a fiction to say the employer can

6

ever meet that standard.

7

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

That

No, I think it reflects the

8

board's empirical understanding that no union will ever

9

have majority support.

In an initial organizing context

10

elections are held and sometimes a sizeable minority of

11

employees don't support the union.

12

Those may, in fact, be the very same employees

13

who are -- who 1 year later, 2 years later, give reports

14

to the employer that the union has lost majority support,

15

and the board is naturally quite skeptical about the --

16

QUESTION:

Well, skepticism can go so far, but I

17

doubt, frankly, whether the board could totally say, union

18

cannot be eliminated unless you get 30 percent of the

19

employees to come in and throw it out.

20

at least doubt whether, under the National Labor Relations

21

Act the employer does not have a right to the assurance

22

that at least there's a reasonable probability that the

23

union represents the majority of his employees.

24

is that not a consideration?
