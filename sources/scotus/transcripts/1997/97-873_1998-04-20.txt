CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in Number 97-873, United States v. Balsys.
Mr. Dreeben.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

9

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The question in this case is whether the Fifth

11

Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination

12

may be invoked based on a fear of foreign prosecution.

13

For three main reasons, we submit that it may not.

14

First, the prohibition against compelling a

15

person to be a witness against himself applies only in a

16

criminal case.

17

Federal criminal case.

18

one of a series of rights set forth in the Fifth and Sixth

19

Amendments that are naturally read to govern criminal

20

trials in this country, not foreign criminal cases.

By that phrase, the Framers meant a

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, in the Arndstein case

23

the Court extended the privilege outside of the scope of a

24

criminal trial, didn't it?

MR. DREEBEN:

That is correct, Mr. Chief

1

Justice, in this respect.

2

a witness in any proceeding, regardless of whether the

3

proceeding is civil, criminal, or administrative, so long

4

as what the witness ultimately fears is incrimination in a

5

criminal case.

6

The privilege may be claimed by

The proper referent to determine whether the

7

Self-Incrimination Clause may be invoked therefor is not

8

the type of proceeding in which it is claimed in this

9

country, but rather the type of proceeding in which the

10

witness actually fears incrimination, and that point is

11

borne out by the history of the clause.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, before you proceed

13

further, would you tell me why 18 U.S.C. 1001 isn't in

14

this picture?

15

United States, so why is it seemed to be conceded that

16

there is no criminal case in the United States?

17

It did involve a false statement to the

MR. DREEBEN:

There could be, Justice Ginsburg,

18

if these statements had been made within a period

19

prosecutable under the statute of limitations, but the

20

original statements that respondent made to gain entry to

21

the United States were in 1963, and the general 5-year

22

statute of limitations has long since run on any

23

prosecution for false statements based on that event and,

24

as a result, the witness is not in a position to claim a

25

fear of domestic incrimination based on any contradiction

1

with his prior statements and I think it's conceded in

2

this case that the only claim of self-incrimination is

3

based on what a foreign power might do if it had custody

4

over respondent and instituted a case.

5

in this case that there is a domestic fear of prosecution

6

by either the State or the Federal Government based on the

7

statements that he has made.
Now, the history of the Self-Incrimination

8

9

There is no claim

Clause in this country points strongly to the conclusion

10

that the words, any criminal case, in the Fifth Amendment

11

refer only to a Federal criminal case.

12

this Court extended the -QUESTION:

13

Wait.

In the era before

You just told us that that

14

refers to the case in which he is asked to testify, not

15

the case in which he would presumably incriminate himself,

16

right?

17

MR. DREEBEN:

I'm not sure, Justice Scalia,

18

whether I was clear before, so let me try to make it

19

clear.

20

QUESTION:

All right.

21

MR. DREEBEN:

22

incrimination must take place --

1

criminal case.
The privilege can be claimed by a witness in any

2

3

proceeding in which he is asked to give compelled

4

testimony, not based on his concerns about what might

5

happen to him in that proceeding, but based on concerns

6

about what might happen to him in a criminal case down the

7

road.
QUESTION:

8
9

I understand, but I don't understand

how you read the phrase,

in any criminal case.

No person

10

shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness

11

against himself.

12

Where is the compulsion?

13

the case in which I am summoned --

14

MR. DREEBEN:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. DREEBEN:

Is the compulsion in

Yes.

--to testify?
Yes.

The compulsion can be in the

17

case in which you are compelled to give testimony under

18

oath, as in this case,

19

contempt powers of the court if you decline to give

20

testimony,

in our view, by a -- backed by the

so the compulsion can occur in any proceeding.

21

QUESTION:

All right.

22

MR. DREEBEN:

But you need also to have

23

incrimination.

The two interlinked requirements of the

24

clause are compulsion and incrimination,

25

here is whether the incrimination can be in a case not

and the question

1

brought in this country by the Federal Government or a

2

State, but by a foreign Government.

3

before the Court in this case.

4

QUESTION:

That is the question

And that's the implication in the

5

latter part, to be a witness against himself, and a

6

witness where is what we're debating.

7
8

MR. DREEBEN:

That is exactly right.

The

question is whether it can be triggered based on
prosecution abroad.

10

Now, if you look at the text of the Fifth and

11

the Sixth Amendments together, which is the logical way to

12

read them because they contain the essential criminal

13

procedure proscriptions that are applicable in trials in

14

this country, the Fifth Amendment seems almost inevitably

15

to be limited to criminal cases brought by the Federal

16

Government.

17

There can be no dispute that the original intent

18

of the Framers of the Bill of Rights was to impose

1

limitations only on the Federal Government, not on the

20

States, and this Court consistently held, in the era

21

before the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified and thereby

22

made certain constitutional protections applicable to the

23

States, that none of the provisions in the original Bill

24

of Rights govern State proceedings and, as a result, State

25

witnesses could not claim the protection of the Fifth

1

2

Amendment.
In that regime, in other words, State witnesses

3

who feared incrimination by a State could not say that

4

they feared incrimination in any criminal case, because

5

State prosecutions were not deemed subsumed within the

6

Fifth Amendment, and there are several textual references

7

that make sense only if read that way.

8

9

The Sixth Amendment refers to all criminal
prosecutions, yet it is quite clear that by that reference

10

the Framers did not intend to refer to State criminal

11

prosecutions, and far less sensible would it be to think

12

that they were referring to foreign criminal prosecutions.

13

The only criminal prosecutions that were originally

14

subsumed by the Sixth Amendment were domestic criminal

15

prosecutions.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

But that goes to where the compulsion

is, not to where the incrimination is, doesn't it?
MR. DREEBEN:

No, Justice Scalia.

I think what

19

it goes to is by what did the Framers mean the words, any

20

criminal case, to refer to?

21

Originally they only meant them to refer to a

22

Federal criminal case and, as a result, this Court held

23

that if a Federal witness was compelled to testify, he

24

said, look, I don't have any concern that I'm going to be

25

incriminated in a Federal criminal case, but I am worried

1

that in the State of Maryland I might be incriminated.
This Court held that is not a basis for

2

3

declining to give testimony, because the criminal case in

4

which you fear incrimination is not a Federal criminal

5

case.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. DREEBEN:

8

QUESTION:

9

That was before the Murphy decision.
That is correct, Justice Ginsburg.

And why shouldn't it be that the

concern is controlling the conduct of the Federal actor,

10

whether a Federal agent, a police officer -- if the

11

amendment is directed against the compulsion, the action

12

that is prohibited is compelling the testimony, why should

13

it matter where the criminal case is instead of who is

14

doing the compelling?

15

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, it always

16

has mattered where the criminal case is, and once this

17

Court held in Malloy v. Hogan that the Fifth Amendment

18

applied equally to the States and to the Federal

19

Government, this Court in the Murphy decision changed the

20

former Federal rule and held that the Fifth Amendment may

21

now be claimed whether the prosecution that is feared

22

would occur in a State or in the Federal Government.

23

The theory behind that is that any jurisdiction

24

that is bound by the Fifth Amendment should not be able to

25

receive testimony that was compelled by another
9

1

jurisdiction, also bound by the Fifth Amendment, and use

2

it to convict someone.

3

So under the Murphy decision two jurisdictions,

4

each bound by the Fifth Amendment, cannot evade that

5

constitutional guarantee by having one compel the

6

testimony and the other one use it, but that is a value

7

that primarily relates to the way we try criminal cases in

8

this country.

9

Like the presumption of innocence and the

10

requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the Fifth

11

Amendment fits into a mosaic of rights that express the

12

view that it is the Government that must prove the

13

defendant's guilt without the assistance of compelling the

14

defendant to incriminate himself out of his own mouth and

15

thereby confess himself into a Federal or a State prison.

16

QUESTION:

Is there anything in our cases which

17

would allow the respondent to make the argument that there

18

is an additional protection in the Fifth Amendment Self-

19

Incrimination Clause that it is simply degrading or

20

destructive of the dignity of the person to be required to

21

answer and to confess a crime?

22

MR. DREEBEN:

I think that that is one of the

23

components that this Court has identified as a value

24

underlying the Fifth Amendment, but it again relates

25

primarily to a value about how we prosecute individuals in

this country.

2

country might choose to adopt a different criminal law

3

system.

4

It says nothing about whether another

QUESTION:

Well, but I'm not so sure, and do you

5

get that out of Malloy or Murphy?

6

interest in individual dignity or autonomy?

7

MR. DREEBEN:

Where do you get this

Well, to the extent that one

8

identifies an interest in individual dignity or autonomy,

9

it does not extend so far as to say the Government cannot

10

exert compulsion.
QUESTION:

11
12

By granting immunity -Of course, because you can have

immunity.

3

MR. DREEBEN:

That's correct.

The Government

4

has always had the countervailing ability to grant

5

immunity and then to compel an individual to say anything

6

about himself that he knows honestly, no matter how

7

offensive it is to him personally, no matter whether it

8

would subject him to personal humiliation or jeopardy of

9

life.

20
21

So long as it's not used against him, those

words -QUESTION:

Which leads me to think that there is

22

no freestanding interest in just individual dignity, that

23

it's -- the only question is whether or not it can be used

24

by the Government which is going to prosecute him.

25

MR. DREEBEN:

I think that that is exactly

interest.

3

interlinked with the potential for incrimination, and --

4

It is not a freestanding

It's an interest that it is integrally

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, can the Federal

5

Government compel testimony that would incriminate someone

6

in a State proceeding by giving him immunity from the

7

State prosecution?
MR. DREEBEN:

8

9

Yes.

It's settled that the

Federal Government has the authority under the Supremacy

10

Clause to declare that testimony that is compelled will

11

not be used against an individual in a State proceeding.
QUESTION:

In a State proceeding as well.

14

QUESTION:

What case settles that?

15

MR. DREEBEN:

12

13

What

case --

That I think is settled by the

16

Kastigar decision, by the Murphy decision, by Brown v.

17

Walker, and by Adams v. Maryland.

18

of these cases in our brief that specifically address the

19

Federal Government's power to do that.

20

QUESTION:

I believe we cited all

Mr. Dreeben, is it possible that the

21

Federal Government, for example in this case the OSI,

22

might want to cooperate with a foreign nation to see the

individual prosecuted elsewhere and have a motive to --

1

foreign prosecution?
MR. DREEBEN:

2

3

Well, I think in a case like this

the Justice Department has dual interests.

4

There is a Federal law that provides for the

5

deportation of an individual who lied to get into this

6

country and who assisted the Nazis in persecuting Jews

7

during World War II, and that is a distinct Federal

8

interest that is being enforced by OSI.
It is also true that OSI regards it as a proper

9
10

component of its mission to see to it that information

11

that may be relevant to a foreign Government's

12

consideration of prosecution is provided.
QUESTION:

13

Well, should that make any difference

14

in our concerns about this case, if it's that kind of a

15

situation?

16

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't think it should make any

17

difference whatsoever, Justice O'Connor, because the

18

underlying question here is not whether it would be fair

19

in a United States prosecution to use this information.

20

The question is whether the United States Constitution has

21

something to say about the way foreign Governments conduct

22

their prosecutions.

23

There is no country that I'm aware of that has a

24

Fifth Amendment right, or a mirror image of the Fifth

25

Amendment right that looks just like ours.

QUESTION:

Do foreign countries scratch our

2

backs, too?

3

the courts of foreign countries that don't have Fifth

4

Amendment protections, knowing that what they say can be

5

used in a Federal criminal prosecution?

6

I mean, do we get people to testify before

MR. DREEBEN:

We don't, Justice Scalia.

My

7

understanding is that we provide sufficient information to

8

the foreign Government and ask them to provide information

9

to a witness when we are seeking testimony from overseas

10
11

about applicable privileges.
Now, the traditional rule about how the

12

privileges are supposed to be applied when countries

13

cooperate in securing testimony is that the foreign

14

country will take the testimony subject to any claim of

15

privilege, and then the privilege is adjudicated in the

16

home country where the privilege actually derives from,

17

but it is not --

Right, but it is not the --

After the cat is out of the bag.
That is true, Justice Ginsburg.

22

It's not the policy of the United States Government to

23

seek to -- that that happen in every case and, as a

24

result, I'm not aware of instances where we did have a

25

foreign Government act as our agent, compelling testimony

1

that would be prohibited if the United States were acting

2

alone.

3

Obviously, that raises a somewhat separate

4

question from the question here, which is whether the

5

United States may use an agent or an intermediary to

6

accomplish something that it cannot accomplish acting

7

directly, but that is an entirely separate question from

8

whether a witness in this country in a domestic U.S.

9

proceeding may claim the Fifth Amendment based not on a

10

fear of prosecution here, but by a fear of what might

11

happen to him if he is -- finds himself in a foreign

12

country and the testimony ends up there.

13

QUESTION:

I take it, then, to your argument it

14

makes no difference whether the foreign country is a

15

country that has a comparable privilege, perhaps, or

16

strata, or whether it's a country that's typical of a

17

civil law system that would not?

18

MR. DREEBEN:

It does make no difference,

19

Justice Ginsburg, because again, I think that the

20

fundamental concern of the Fifth Amendment and as applied

21

to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment is how we

22

conduct our criminal prosecutions here.

23

QUESTION:

Why is that?

That is, if -- I'm

24

thinking only of the Fourteenth.

25

let's say hypothetically the Fifth is Federal.

I agree with you that,

15

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

They're

1

talking about a Federal trial, but the Fourteenth uses the

2

word liberty, and it protects a person's liberties.
So if there's a person in Ohio who would be

3
4

deprived of a liberty by having his testimony taken and

5

used in an Ohio proceeding, it would deprive that person

6

of a liberty, so he must have a liberty not to have his

7

testimony forced from him for Ohio.

8

from Lithuania?
MR. DREEBEN:

9

QUESTION:

10

Why is it different

It's --

I mean, the Fourteenth Amendment

11

doesn't talk about what Ohio can do.

12

MR. DREEBEN:

It's different because Ohio,

unlike Lithuania, is bound by the Fifth Amendment

16

Where does it say that in the

Constitution?

Constitution is that you cannot deprive a person of a

It says no State shall deprive a person of a

We're talking about a liberty.

I thought all that it says in the

this Court in the Murphy decision attempted to make sense

It isn't technically and strictly correct to say that the

MR. DREEBEN:

Once the Court has made the

decision to extend the right in question to the States

through the Fourteenth Amendment, that's correct.

10

QUESTION:

They are coterminous in each case.

MR. DREEBEN:

They're coextensive, and the

11

fundamental premise of the Murphy decision is that we do

12

have cooperative federalism in this country when it comes

13

to law enforcement, and it makes very little sense to say

14

that once the States are no longer free to compel

15

testimony under the Federal Constitution, that they may

16

then operate together and achieve results that they

17

couldn't achieve --

18

QUESTION:

Can I ask you about that, because I

19

was just testing out the linguistic argument, that's why I

20

was -- Justice Stevens made the point linguistically, but

21

I have a practical question, which is why -- how

22

specifically would extension of the protection that you

23

oppose interfere with Government law enforcement efforts?

24
25

In particular, I'm thinking that it must be
perhaps a fairly unusual case where, say, as here, the

2

risk of domestic protection.
I'm guessing that in most cases anybody who can

3
4

assert a Fifth Amendment privilege in respect to a foreign

5

country probably could here, too, so I'm interested in --

6

I'm raising that so you'll respond to the real

7

practicality, how would extension really interfere with

8

law enforcement efforts?
MR. DREEBEN:

9

The extension of the privilege to

10

foreign prosecutions would seriously interfere with

11

domestic investigations, because we cannot grant immunity

12

from a fear of foreign prosecutions.
QUESTION:

13
14

Why don't you just say to the person

you wouldn't deport him?
MR. DREEBEN:

15

That has not been considered by

16

most courts an adequate answer to concerns about the Fifth

17

Amendment.

18

as a guarantee that depends on whether later events bear

19

it out.

20

The Fifth Amendment is not -- does not stand

QUESTION:

But doesn't there have to be a

21

realistic threat of prosecution, and if you say you're not

22

going to deport him, then there's no realistic threat.

23

MR. DREEBEN:

No, there may well be a realistic

24

threat of prosecution because a foreign country may issue

25

an extradition order to us, so we then have the discretion

to say, well, we're not going to comply with the terms of

2

our extradition treaty, but we then have to answer to the

3

world community for our decision not to do that.
In a case in which, for example, an act of

4
5

terrorism occurs abroad that involves citizens of foreign

6

States, we may apprehend some of them, bring them to this

7

country, learn that they fear domestic prosecution, and

issue an immunity order which would ordinarily require

them to testify, but they may say no, I'm sorry, I'm not

In the jurisdictions where a claim like this

did in this case, several bodies of foreign law and try to

23

make appraisal of the realistic ability of a foreign

government to prosecute, and that stands quite a bit in

2

the Government has immunity power, and the immunity power

has always been viewed as essentially coextensive with the

reach of the Fifth Amendment.

5

QUESTION:

Outside of a witness who is a

further than that.

Normally, if a witness can identify a

Courts don't typically take in camera testimony

17

to determine whether the answers would really be

18

incriminating, and they don't typically ask whether the

19

State or Government prosecution that is feared is really

20

likely to happen.

21

It's generally enough simply to assert that

22

there is testimony that would incriminate the individual

23

and to identify a law under which that might happen, and

24

the Government's next step is ordinarily immunity if it

25

wants the testimony.

But immunity orders aren't going to work in this

1

2

context, because we rarely are going to be able to

3

guarantee that the immunity order will actually be

4

coextensive with the scope of the privilege and prevent

5

the use of the testimony overseas and, as a result, we may

6

well be in situations where we're investigating serious

7

terrorist activity, or interstate -- international drug

trafficking, money laundering, white collar crime, and we

are helpless to attain our prosecutorial objectives

because an immunity order simply doesn't work.

each of them fairly substantial, so that you're going --

1

Now, it is conceivable that if the Court were to

2

hold that the United States were somehow completely in

3

control of a foreign prosecution so that some foreign

4

Government's prosecution were really nothing but a sham, a

5

cover under which the United States were really the

6

prosecuting entity, then the analysis might be different.

7

This Court had suggested that there might be an

8

exemption to the traditional dual sovereignty rule under

9

the Double Jeopardy Clause, which allows the States and

10

the Federal Government each to prosecute.

11

State prosecution was simply a cover for the Federal

13

Government to take over and do it as a tool, the --

is a cover, but that the United States is very eager to

assist the foreign prosecution.

in your view?

19

It's not that the foreign prosecution

MR. DREEBEN:

That makes no difference

I -- no, that makes no difference,

20

because the ultimate constitutional question is whether

21

the criminal case in which incrimination is feared is a

criminal case within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.

23

Our essential position is that no foreign

24

criminal case fits within the language of the Fifth

Amendment, construed in light of its history and its

1

policies and, as a result, it simply doesn't matter that

2

the witness may say, I fear incrimination overseas because

3

the United States may cooperate with a foreign government.

4

Now, again, the role of immunity statutes here,

5

in our view, is key, because there has never been a time

6

in this country in which a claim of the Fifth Amendment

7

privilege could not be met by the Government seeking to

8

get the testimony through granting immunity, but if this

9

rule proposed by the respondent and accepted by the Second

10

Circuit were adopted, it would mean that the United States

11

would no longer be able to obtain needed testimony and it

12

would put a witness who feared foreign prosecution in a

13

better position than a witness who fears domestic

14

prosecution.

15

QUESTION:

Of course, the Constitution would

16

have had the same meaning, I suppose, if the Congress had

17

never passed any immunity statutes.

18

MR. DREEBEN:

The Constitution would have, and

19

it would have meant that immunity statutes would be

20

permissible if a legislature wished to pass them.

21

The historical fact is that, as the Fifth

22

Amendment right developed in the common law in England,

23

simultaneously it was recognized that testimony could be

24

compelled if immunity was granted and, in the colonies in

25

1

Amendment privilege, immunity statutes were also enacted.

2

Now, the Federal Government didn't get into the

3

business of enacting immunity statutes until about 1857,

4

but I think that's largely explicable by the very small

5

role of the Federal Government in prosecuting criminal

6

cases in the early years of this Nation.

7

QUESTION:

Yes, but the Second Circuit's

8

suggestion was that the Congress could pass statutes in

the extradition and deportation area that are analogous to

the immunity statutes in the domestic area.

thereby do just what the immunity statutes have done.

1

MR. DREEBEN:

Because the Second Circuit's

2

suggestion in effect would grant transactional immunity.

3

Not only would the witness be free from having his words

4

used against him, he would be free from any prosecution

5

altogether, because if the theory of the immunity statute

6

that the Second Circuit posited is correct, that witness

7

can never be sent to the foreign country where he might be

8

prosecuted, and that grants the witness something far more

9

than he would have in the United States, puts him in a

10

much better position than a similarly situated U.S.

11

witness would be, and thwarts the foreign country's

12

interest in prosecuting if it could do it without the

13

defendant's words at all.

14

It is also anomalous because the Second

15

Circuit's holding would grant a witness greater protection

16

than he might have in the country to which he ultimately

17

goes if he faces prosecution.

recognize a Fifth Amendment privilege in the same way or

to the same extent as this country, and thus we have the

anomaly that here the witness says, I don't want my words

to be used against me because I fear prosecution in a

foreign country, and then when he gets there that foreign

country says, we'd now like your testimony.

that Kastigar explained Murphy as being the result of the

theory it's got to go a step further, or we would have to

2

adopt a compulsion theory, but that seems out of the

3

question, because we routinely compel testimony if, in

4

fact, the immunity can be granted.

5

we've got to come up with a brand-new theory of what a

6

criminal case is, and we're going to have to reject the

7

prior explanation in order for the case to come out your

8

way.
MR. BERZINS:

9

So it seems to me

Your Honor, I submit that the case

10

could come out as I advocate it if the Court adopts the

11

view that the personal liberties component as explained in

12

Murphy is a very important one, and that it cannot be

13

brushed aside merely because the infliction of criminal

14

penalties will take place elsewhere.
The fear is here.

MR. BERZINS:

Your Honor, I would, and I would

object for the reasons stated by the district court in

coextensive with the privilege.

That has been recognized

2

as a very difficult prospect in light of all the newspaper

articles we read about grand jury leaks, et cetera.
And even more concern to me is what would happen

4
5

if there is a sealing order, my client gets deported

overseas, and then the leaks come out overseas.

there is no way that that situation can be remedied.

too late.

QUESTION:

It's

But once your client is overseas -- I

10

don't know what the Lithuanian legal system is, but most

11

systems have at best a muted self-incrimination guarantee

12

compared to ours, so once he's over there the likelihood

13

his that his testimony could be compelled, is that not so?

14

MR. BERZINS:

Yes, Your Honor, but I submit we

ought not be concerned with what the procedural systems

are that might compel it.

18

happens to the compulsion overseas.

The Fifth Amendment does not, I submit, protect

against other compulsions and other disabilities and other

22

harms, only against infliction of criminal penalties, and

23

24

submit that is a liberty interest that should be

25

recognized as a very important one.

1

As I submit, the Murphy court in its explanation

2

highlighted it very prominently, and on that basis I ask

3

you to recognize it when the obvious fear of infliction of

4

criminal penalties is real.

5

Mr. Chief Justice raised the question about

6

administrative difficulties.

Thus far I do not believe

7

administrative difficulties have been encountered in these

8

cases, because the burden has always been upon the

9

claimant to establish precisely what it is that he fears

10

and what are the realistic chances of him winding up

11

before a criminal court where the criminal penalties will

12

be inflicted.

13

QUESTION:

Was this tried as an issue of fact in

14

the district court, Mr. Berzins?

15

MR. BERZINS:

Mr. Chief Justice, that was

16

extensively handled in the district court, and it was --

17

in each case it is a claimant's burden and it's a heavy

18

one under the Flanigan case in the Second Circuit.

19

whole litany of things that the claimant has to prove

20

before he can have any chance of having the privilege

21

recognized.

22

QUESTION:

Well, if there is a whole litany of

23

things, it seems to me that that would make for

24

administrative difficulties.

25

It's a

2

difficulty is upon the claimant, not upon the courts.
QUESTION:

Well, but the fact that it may be a

3

hard row for the claimant to hoe doesn't mean that that

4

fact shouldn't be taken into consideration, because it's

5

also going to be something that the district court

6

probably has to spend a fair amount of time on.

7

MR. BERZINS:

Admittedly, the district court may

8

have to spend some time on it, but it's up to the claimant

9

to bring to the district court every last piece of

10

evidence on which he relies and which will establish his

11

claim as being a legitimate claim as distinguished from a

12

fanciful or contrived claim, and that burden is upon the

13

claimant, and once the claimant establishes it, I submit

14

the privilege ought to be permitted to be invoked, because

15

the alternative is the cruel trilemma to which I must

16

again return and urge you to recognize it from the

17

standpoint of the claimant.

18

It makes no difference to him where he will

19

spend his time in jail.

20

the gallows are overseas, it's a criminal penalty from his

21

point of view, and from his point of view the liberty

22

interest is definitely infringed upon.

23

QUESTION:

If the jail is overseas, or if

Well, if it makes no difference I

24

suppose he can just refuse to answer, and then he can

spend his time in jail here.

MR. BERZINS:

Well, Your Honor, I think you hit

But that does not minimize the

constitutional claim that we're advocating.

Murphy, and I submit to you that individual liberties

component, if it is recognized, as being a very important

component of the privilege.
QUESTION:

Well, calling it an individual

12

liberty doesn't make it any -- doesn't change the wording

13

of the Fifth Amendment, which is a privilege against self-

14

incrimination, and I think -- you know, worldwide, as

15

Justice Ginsburg has suggested, that is not a universal --

universally valued as highly as it is in this country.

strong language in saying that the liberty aspect of the

privilege is important.
QUESTION:

2

It's not --

Of course, it's a liberty that he has

3

while he's in this country.

If as Justice Kennedy

4

suggested, a case in which the Government has two grounds

5

for deportation, one that doesn't incriminate him and one

6

that does, and say he's silent about the one that does but

7

he gets deported on the other ground and he gets sent to

8

Lithuania, and if Lithuania doesn't recognize this
liberty, he would there be forced to testify against

10

himself, wouldn't he?
MR. BERZINS:

11

That may very well come to pass,

12

Your Honor, but nevertheless, while he is here, and while

13

he is subject to an Article III court, that Article III

14

court ought not compel him to convict himself out of his

15

own mouth, not here in this country.
What happens in Lithuania, we can't control, but

16
17

we can control --

QUESTION:

Well, he hasn't convicted himself out

1

of his own mouth in our courts because he hasn't violated

not provide that particular liberty protection that we

own mouth, that I submit violates the privilege, because

2

he's being compelled here without a grant of immunity.

3

Every case where immunity has been granted, and the

4

claimant has been forced to testify, the fear of the

5

criminal penalties has been eliminated.
But if the fear of the criminal penalties is not

eliminated, I submit that the violation is there

QUESTION:

It is

You do acknowledge that it is kind of

11

a superprivilege that he would have because of the absence

12

of the immunity, the absence of the United States' ability

13

to give -- to immunize the testimony?

MR. BERZINS:

Your Honor, characterizing it as a

15

superprivilege, I don't want to join in that

characterization.

country and if, in fact, it's a drug dealer from New York

2

who's in Ohio, and Ohio wants to compel the testimony,

3

Ohio can simply give use immunity, or -- and it's possible

4

that -- and that person can't be prosecuted for what flows

5

from that particular testimony.
But suppose the person, instead of coming from

6

7

New York to Ohio, comes from some foreign country to Ohio,

8

and now the Government is saying, well, we don't know what

9

to do.

10

I mean, we'll never be able to get this testimony.

There's no way to deal with the foreign country.
The best we could ever do is not deport him, and

11

12

if we don't deport him, that means he can never be

13

prosecuted there for anything, though he might have been

the worst murderer in this other country that anybody's

Now, what's your response?

to that claim of the Government?

MR. BERZINS:

Is there a response

Your Honor, my response is that

obviously there will be cases where the Government will

20

not be able to either grant immunity or get the foreign

21

government to cooperate in granting a pardon, or issuing

22

its own immunity, or whatever.

cases, but I submit to you that those cases will be far

and few, and they really ought not be what turns this
