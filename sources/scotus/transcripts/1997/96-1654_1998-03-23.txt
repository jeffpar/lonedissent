Here, the context is

Third, the Government's view would make carries

924 (b) and numerous other gun provisions use the word

10
11

the concept of transport when it wanted to.
QUESTION:

Do any of those other provisions

12

speak of transport in relation to a crime of violence, or

13

a drug crime, or is it just transport in the abstract?

14

MR. KLONOFF:

Well, there are a whole variety of

15

provisions, Justice Souter.

I guess one that comes to

16

mind is 18 U.S.C. 926(a), which talks about transporting,

17

shipping or receiving a firearm or transporting a firearm

18

for any lawful purpose from any place where he may

lawfully possess and carry such a firearm.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. KLONOFF

9

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER MUSCARELLO
MR. KLONOFF:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

This case raises the issue left open in Bailey

13

v. United States, what it means to carry a firearm under

14

18 U.S.C. 924(c)(1).

15

principal reasons carries a firearm means, bears a firearm

16

on one's person.

17

carries a firearm, directly supports petitioner's

18

position.

19

carries a firearm with having a firearm on the person.

20

Petitioner submits that for four

First, the plain meaning of the phrase,

Dictionaries repeatedly and consistently equate

Second, the Government has not cited a single

21

dictionary that defines the phrase, carries a firearm, to

22

mean transporting or possessing a firearm in a vehicle.

23

Instead, the Government improperly isolates the word

24

carry, rather than looking at the specific context,

25

carries a firearm, but although the term carry has

1

Not -- transporting, shipping or

2

receiving for any lawful purpose from where he may legally

possess.

QUESTION:

But it --

5

QUESTION:

That's a crime?

MR. KLONOFF:

7

QUESTION:

8

Yes, Your Honor.

I didn't realize we'd gone that far

yet.
(Laughter.)

9

QUESTION:

10

In any case, I take it the other

11

references to transport as a prohibition did not make the

12

limitation that this prohibition has on carries.

13
14

MR. KLONOFF:

Not in that precise terminology,

that's correct.

15

QUESTION:

So that to read it as the Government

16

would read it I think probably would not, therefore, just

17

duplicate, in effect, all of the other prohibitions on

18

transportation, correct?

19
20

MR. KLONOFF:

Well, we think that it would.

In

fact, the Government itself in its -QUESTION:

21

Maybe I'm not getting my point

22

across.

I thought the reason that it wouldn't was that

23

there's a limitation.

restriction does not occur in the instances in which

There's a restriction here, in

of the statute.

That's the only point that I'm trying

MR. KLONOFF:

4

No, I understand, but the during

5

and in relation to is a separate component, but in terms

6

of the meaning of the word carry we think that it is

7

instructive to look at the other statutes.
QUESTION:

8

9

I still don't think you're

understanding Justice Souter's point.

He's saying that

10

just as you say the word firearm must be taken into

11

account in determining the meaning of the word carry

12

because that's part of its context, so also the phrase, in

13

relation to a crime of violence or a drug offense must be

14

taken into account in gathering the meaning of carry,

15

because that is part of its context.

16
17
18
19

MR. KLONOFF:

Oh, I agree with that point, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Okay.

Now, the second question is,

are there any other statutes that have similar language?

20

MR. KLONOFF:

21

QUESTION:

No, there are not.

I can't imagine that there's none

22

that says it's a crime to transport a firearm for an

23

unlawful purpose - -

MR. KLONOFF:

crime to carry it for a lawful purpose.

MR. KLONOFF:
that,

Your Honor.

That is the answer.

QUESTION:

4

There's no statute precisely like

With reference to carry,

the

definition of firearm includes a missile, a rocket

MR. KLONOFF:

QUESTION:

9

launcher in your vest pocket?

There is a broad --

Do you have to carry the rocket

MR. KLONOFF:

10

Yes.

No, and that is correct, Your

11

Honor.

There are some types of firearms as defined in 921

12

that you couldn't physically have on your person, of

13

course.

14

QUESTION:

Or a land mine.

15

MR. KLONOFF:

That's correct.

Of course,

the

16

definition of firearm in 921 is for the entire Chapter 44,

17

and it's not surprising that there may be situations that

18

don't fit every circumstance, and that would --

QUESTION:

So then if you had a land mine in

21

utility vehicle,

22

that would be carrying it?
It would not be.

Our definition

23

of carrying is limited to on the person.

There are some

24

kinds of firearms --

that cannot be carried and therefore there's no violation

of the statute,

in your view?

MR. KLONOFF:

Well,

there could be a violation

for using in those circumstances,

QUESTION:

MR. KLONOFF:

or - -

Transporting.
Exactly, under other provisions,

7

so there are a number of ways you could get at the same

conduct.

If Congress wanted to - QUESTION:

But are there any statutes in which

Congress has defined something like firearm, punishing its

11

carrying, but then the firearm is so defined that it

12

cannot be carried?

3

I don't understand how that works.

MR. KLONOFF:

Well,

it only - - as I said,

it

4

only applies to a small number of the firearms contained

5

with the definition of 92 (a)'(3), and again we don't think

6

it at all surprising that when you have a statute that's

7

applied to the entire firearms chapter,

8

one or two types of firearms as defined that you could not

9

physically carry on your person.

20

that there may be

That is a problem for Congress to fix under the

21

proposed legislation, which would expand to include

22

possession.

23

that's a problem that Congress has to fix.

1

conceivable type of firearm could not be carried on the

2

person should inform this Court's interpretation of the

3

words, carries a firearm.

4

QUESTION:

What about Judge Trott's view that

5

whatever line is drawn here it would make no sense to say

6

to the savvy criminal, hide the gun and you're home free.

7

Just don't keep it on your person.

8

get at it when you need it.

9

to attribute to Congress?
MR. KLONOFF:

10

Keep it where you can

Would that be a sensible line

Judge Trott's analysis is entirely

11

flawed.

12

the absurdity of a situation where somebody has a gun on

13

his person and then puts it on the car seat and all of a

14

sudden he's scott free.

15

If the Court looks at his opinion, he talks about

That's not at all the position we're arguing.

16

We're not focusing entirely on the point of arrest, and if

17

the Government can prove to the jury that the individual

18

had the firearm on his person at some point during and in

19

relation to the crime at issue, he would be prosecuted.

20

So in Judge Trott's example, there is adequate

21

evidence under petitioner's definition of carries a

22

firearm to convict that person.

23

Now, let me just respond, though, to Your

24

Honor's question.

right in terms of what the every-day criminal thinks, and

I submit that Judge Kozinski has it

he thinks of carrying a firearm as packing heat, and I

2

would give the Court an example that illustrates the

3

point.

Well, let me ask you this.

He'd

Suppose

4

the person with the gun physically had it in his hands and

put it in the car in order to go and have a drug

transaction and in order to have a weapon available to

facilitate carrying out the drug transaction.

1

MR. KLONOFF:

2

QUESTION:

Yes, during and in relation to.

So can he be charged with carrying

3

the gun because he carried it to the car, where he then

4

put it where it was not immediately available?
MR. KLONOFF:

5

Under our view yes if -- as long

6

as the Government can also show the during and in relation

7

to, and for example, a possession with intent to

8

distribute situation, where you're putting drugs in the

9

car, you're putting your gun in the car, seems to me

10

there's more than sufficient evidence there, and again,

11

that's why I think Judge Trott's analysis is faulty,

12

because in many of those situations you will have

13

sufficient evidence of carries a firearm on the person.
QUESTION:

14

In every case, Mr. Klonoff, where you

15

have a drug in the trunk -- a gun in the trunk, a gun in

16

the glove -- someone carried it and put it there, so under

17

your analysis, much would depend on how we define in

gun in his car at all times, when he goes shopping, when

2

he goes to church, and when he distributes the drugs.
MR. KLONOFF:

3
4

that might be correct, but again, that's a problem --

5

(Laughter.)

6

MR. KLONOFF:

7

And that goes back to what Judge

Trott said.
But the point is, is that those oddities, we

If he's reading up on the statute

submit, are for Congress to fix.
QUESTION:

10

What are the oddities?

That's -- I

11

mean, I carry plants in the back of my car in the trunk, I

12

think, haven't I, when I go to the nursery, pick up the

13

plants, put them in the trunk, carry them to my house.

always thought I was carrying the plants.

as you do, that if there really are things like you see in

You said that was odd, and I'm not

3

MR. KLONOFF:

4

QUESTION:

5
6

Well, there are --

I want you to focus on what those

are.
MR. KLONOFF:

There are several.

First of all,

7

under the Government's own theory, since movement is

8

required, if an individual was sitting on a couch and the

9

gun's next to him, he's not carrying it, so there's

10
11
12

13
14

immediate access but the Government says it's not carried.
Secondly, it's not clear whether the
Government's position -QUESTION:

Or, indeed, even if it's on his

person, so long as he hasn't moved it, I suppose.

15

MR. KLONOFF:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

Exactly, that's right.

If he gets one of his confederates to

come and hand him the gun and he puts it - QUESTION:

So there are oddities of omission,

19

but is there any oddity of -- is there any oddity that is

20

produced -- if we accept the Government's interpretation,

21

does that produce anything odd?

22

MR. KLONOFF:

I think it does.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. KLONOFF:

position applies to a passenger.

For example --

What is that?
-- I don't think the Government's
I think it only applies

convict the big drug dealer that has an automatic machine

4

not that that has -- we have to draw a line somewhere, but

5

I just want to point out our thinking about this.

6

Again, there's no linguistic reason to define

7

carry as an auto --as transporting, and pure transport

8

has enormous problems, as I think we've pointed out to

you.

10

QUESTION:

Suppose you define carry as transport

11

but omit the meaning of transport that means ship.

In

other words, transport some -- it's transport, but not

arrange for transport.

14

MR. ZALKIND:

Well, Justice Breyer, then you --

15

you're adding to the interpretive problems even further.

16

You're getting into ambiguity with that, and if you're

17

getting into ambiguity we start to think about the Rule of

18

Lenity, because we're talking about very serious crimes.

19

In the Cleveland and Gray case, they got 10

20

years to begin with.

Forget about the firearm.

They

21

start off with 10 years of their lives, and now we have

22

this enormous minimum mandatory 5 years that's going to be

23

added, and if they're not convicted of that the judge

could have - - in that case he could have used the

So it isn't that the trial judges don't have

1

power to penalize bad behavior, but we're talking about

carrying firearms, a sort of narrow class of separate

minimum mandatory crimes for people that are being

severely punished, so - QUESTION:

10

Justice Ginsburg, no, we don't

11

accept that line, although if you accept that line, then

12

we would prevail.

13

But again, that's another transport exception,

because there is that movement that Justice Kozinski

eloquently states in his en banc decision, and we're

saying that no, that that would not be carry.

1

common experience tells us that people move a lot, unlike

2

vehicles, which sit parked in garages or at the curb for

3

long periods of time, I think the concept that you have to

4

have movement at a particular moment with a person has

5

kind of dropped out or become vestigial.

6

And as a result when it's talking about carrying

7

it on a person, although in point of fact if movement were

required it wouldn't make any difference, because people

do move, and the inference that someone has moved, if they

9

there is a lot of overlap between the terms, but there's a

couple of features that clearly - - I think three things

that clearly distinguish them.
First, carry requires that the person who's

carrying it accompany the item that's carried.

think transport requires that.
Second,

I don't

carrying is more commonly used, and this

may be just a question of connotations, but where the

4

trafficking offense, but if the gun is being moved from

one place to another so that it can be of use and

carried.

It's still being carried because if the

It's very strange for Congress to

convey those two quite different meanings.

Number 1, I'm

worried about somebody carrying a gun on his person, so

that even if he's sitting there stock still, I want this

-- to use the same word to cover both

of those things, I find that extraordinary.
MR. FELDMAN:

17
18

I don't --

I think -- let me approach that in

two ways.
One is, the case with the caboose, I do think

20

that would be a carry, but the term, the fact that the

term carry, when you get a vehicle that's sufficiently

22

large, the Queen Elizabeth, or something like that,

23

whether -- the defendant is in one place, the gun is in

24

another, whether the term carry has some fuzziness in that

kind of a case I don't think should affect the fact that

in a case like these, which is where you have it in a

4

QUESTION:

Those cases just make the point more

5

vivid, and the point is, it seems strange -- sure, the

6

word can bear each of those meanings, but it seems strange

7

for Congress to pick that word without using an additional

8

word to cover both of them.
MR. FELDMAN:

9

I -- yes.

Your Honor, I don't

10

think it is strange, for two reasons.

11

what Congress was getting at was the act of taking that

12

gun to the scene of a drug transaction, just as the

13

defendants were doing here, and it was not material to

14

Congress whether defendants did that in a suitcase, on

their -- in a pocket, in the car, in the trunk, or on the

seat.

recognized in Bailey, what Congress was concerned about

2

was not just criminalizing their possession of someone who

3

keeps a gun in their house and who then -- they were

4

worried that that, the fact that someone keeps a gun in

5

their house should not be a predicate liability here if it

6

has no other relationship to the crime or if it's just a

7

matter of intent.
But where someone takes the intentional act of

8

9

taking the gun and taking it with that person, as these

10

defendants did, so it would be at the scene of the

11

crime -- in fact, in the case of Cleveland and Gray, it

12

would be essential to commit that crime because they were

13

intending to rob drugs from another, a dealer, then I

think that is the crime that Congress was trying to get

at.

QUESTION:

Well, how can you do that if it's not

MR. FELDMAN:

No, well, for example, if it's

sitting on a table in your house and sitting out there on

5

the table while you're doing the drug transaction, or not

6

in your house, or some other location, I think that you

7

might be referring to it or displaying it, but I don't

think you would be carrying it.

But I would also point out that I think that the

10

same view would hold true if you adopt petitioner's view

of the statute.

QUESTION:

That is, I thought that the second definition in

where there is no physical movement but you say, are you

2

I'd like to make one point related to the State

of all these numerous State laws and therefore we

shouldn't pay any attention to them in construing section

924(c).

7

9

Well, when Congress enacted section 924(c) in
968 it said the statute provided for prohibition of
carrying unlawfully during a predicate offense.

When they

10

said carry unlawfully, they were exactly intending to pick

11

up, and they knew that they were intending to pick up

12

State law on carrying.

An unlawful carry was a carry that

3

was primarily in violation of State law.

There were very

few Federal laws that governed carrying at the time.

defendant him or herself is going to be the one who not

2

only has the gun in the car, but then -- with the idea

3

that it will be used at some later date, I think it's much

more natural to use the word carry than transport, which

refers just to the bare movement from one place to another

all -- for all kinds of other possible reasons.
QUESTION:

May I go back to the provision, for

transportation with intent that the crime be committed

therewith.

12

but hoping that they might in fact be able to commit their

13

crime without it?

with that state of mind?

Would that intent element be satisfied if they

Would the intent element be satisfied

MR. FELDMAN:

You know, I'm not really aware of

16

exactly how that's been interpreted in a case like -- I

17

guess -- if I can be permitted I'd guess at it, but I'm

18

not sure it's going to be borne out by whatever cases have

19

come up, which is in Muscarello's case it may be difficult

20

to show that it was transported, that the crime would be

21

committed with the gun, because the gun was there to

22

provide him protection during the crime.

23

In Cleveland and Gray's case I think probably it

24

would be, because they were going to use the gun in order

25

to rob the dealer and -- to steal drugs from another drug

QUESTION:

I don't believe --

Because you don't need -- you don't

6

need the broad reading of carry to get the kind of

7

instance which, as a matter of fact, most of our

8

hypotheticals have been describing.

9

MR. FELDMAN:

I don't know -- I don't know -- it

10

may be that there's an overlap and there's other statutes

11

in title 18 that would cover the conduct of these

12

defendants, and there's a very broad range of different

13

kinds of cases that come up under 924(c), but I think the

14

important point is that the term carry is naturally used

15

to carrying it in a vehicle.

16

since 1968.

It's been used that way

17

There's --no court has ever said that it's not

18

used that way, and I think that's a reflection of the way

19

that term would ordinarily be used and ordinarily

20

understood by Congress at that time and at each of the

21

times that it's amended the statute since then.

22

And for that reason I don't -- I think that

Congress was very concerned with seeing to it that the

conduct that leads up to the possible use of a gun, this

was -- the carrying offense is really meant to kind of

trying to get at was that if someone takes a gun in

QUESTION:

But robbery is a separate offense.

3

MR. FELDMAN:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. FELDMAN:

That's correct.

That isn't the drug crime.
That's correct, but their drug

6

crime was attempted possession with intent to distribute.

7

It was going to be their attempt to get the drugs.

8

9

But if they had carried -- the rendez-vous point
had been a couple of blocks from where they were and they

10

had carried the bag in their hands rather than in the

11

trunk of the car, it would have made no difference from

12

what Congress was trying to get at in this statute.

13

What they were concerned was getting that --

14

people taking that gun to the scene of the crime and

15

especially as this Court has interpreted use, I think they

16

didn't want to have to wait until someone actually pulls

17

it out and starts using it in a very active sense in order

18

to say that that --we want to keep that gun away from

19

that drug offense, and whether they take it there in their

20

car, or take it there in a bag I don't think was of great

21

significance, nor should be in interpreting the statute.

QUESTION:

Is carrying -- the half of carrying

that doesn't consist of on the person, is that always

QUESTION:

7

No, it's not always --

I don't want to lead you into the

hole.

8

MR. FELDMAN:

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

But I am sort of bemused by section

10

925, which says the provisions of this chapter, except for

11

a few sections which are not the one we're talking about

12

here, shall not apply with respect to the transportation,

13

shipment, receipt, possession, or importation of any

14

firearm or ammunition imported for, sold, or shipped to or

15

issued for the use of the United States or any department

16

or agency thereof, or any State.

17

Now, I suppose that that -- you know, if

18

transportation includes carry, I guess that would let

19

the -- or if carry is always transportation, the carry

20

section wouldn't apply if you're using a -- I don't know,

21

a gun that's been taken from a Federal agent, which

wouldn't make much sense.

My answer is no for another reason as well,

1

2

which is, as I said, I think transportation doesn't

3

require that the defendant accompany the gun, and I think

4

carrying does require that the defendant accompany the

gun.
And again, that points out why the -- the

6

7

seriousness of this offense and the reason why Congress

8

wanted to get at carrying, which is, they were concerned

9

with the defendant taking the gun along so that it would

10

be there and available for use at the time when the

11

defendant is prepared to commit a drug deal to possess the

transporting it, but transporting it does not always

involve carrying it.

3

QUESTION:

I don't -- does that help?
I thought carrying, at its heart,

from Middle English on, was having somebody in a cart,

That's correct, and I think -- I

two words, but there are some different uses.

So there are differences between the two

14

statutes, and there's reasons why Congress would have

chosen to treat them differently.

16

I also think, though,

that where it's ultimately

17

intended that the person who's doing the carrying is going

18

to be the one who's doing the using also,

19

natural to refer to carry rather than use, as,

example, you carry - - as I said before, you carry a pen in

21

your pocket, you carry a flashlight in your glove

compartment.
