ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL P. GAUGHAN

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

MR. GAUGHAN:

-- and may it please the Court:

13

This case involves an interpretation of the

14

preference provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, found at 11

15

U.S.C. section 547.

16

petitioner's brief.

17

That is on pages 1 through 5 of

The issue in a nutshell is whether or not the

18

petitioner, Fidelity Financial Services, timely perfected

19

its lien so as to qualify for the enabling loan exception

20

provided in 547(c) (3) .
It is undisputed that Fidelity satisfied all the

21
22

requirements of 11 U.S.C. section 547(c) (3), subsection

23

(A).

24

subsection (B).

25

must be perfected on or before 20 days after the debtor

receives possession of such property, meaning the financed

When a transfer is perfected is defined by the

Bankruptcy Code at section 547 (e) (1) (B) .

7

Therefore, under those

Well,

it certainly is possible that

8

Congress intended that its provision,

9

after receiving possession of the property is what

10

the 20-day provision

governs.
MR. GAUGHAN:

11

Of course,

Congress also included

12

the 547(e) (1) (B)

section, which incorporates State law,

in

13

defining when a transfer is perfected,

14

purposes, of course, when a transfer occurs is when it is

and that incorporates State

so State law is implicit in that consideration.

New Mexico for recreational vehicles.
QUESTION:

3

What happens in a State like

4

Massachusetts, as I understand it, that has a shorter

5

limit?

The period becomes whatever is the longer period?

6

MR. GAUGHAN:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. GAUGHAN:

9

Justice --

The State, or the Federal?
Justice Ginsburg, I'm sorry, but

I'm not aware of that provision in the Massachusetts law.
QUESTION:

10

Well, let's just imagine a State --

11

your State has a 30-day provision.

12

says you've got to do it within 10 days or it doesn't

13

relate back.

14

MR. GAUGHAN:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. GAUGHAN:

Let's say another one

Correct.

So what happens under such a statute?
Well, under the current

17

interpretations of the code, if the lien is perfected

18

within 20 days the Federal law controls.

19

QUESTION:

So it's the longer -- it's whichever

20

gives you more time, the State or the Feds.

21

position, essentially.

22

MR. GAUGHAN:

23

QUESTION:

Then I don't --

24

QUESTION:

But you can't perfect it within 20

25

days.

That's your

That is the position that we take.

You can't perfect it under State law between 11 and

1

20 days, so the shorter period would de facto govern,

2

wouldn't it?

3

MR. GAUGHAN:

4

QUESTION:

Well --

It has to be perfected within 20

5

days, but in Massachusetts on the hypothesis it cannot be

6

perfected after the tenth day.

7

MR. GAUGHAN:

Of course, we're referring to the

8

Missouri statute, which includes a provision that deems

9

the perfection to relate back to day 1.

10

QUESTION:

No, but --

11

MR. GAUGHAN:

12

QUESTION:

It back-dates the perfection.

I understand that, but this is an

13

important point, and it's a point that helps you, by the

14

way, because if it is correct that the Massachusetts

15

10-day provision would supersede the 20-day, you have

16

available the argument that this statute cannot possibly

17

provide a uniform period anyway because it's conceded that

18

State law can shorten it, and we're only arguing about

19

whether State law can lengthen it.

20

MR. GAUGHAN:

21

QUESTION:

True.

Then that's right, isn't it?

22

isn't just what Justice Scalia said right?

23

isn't right, I'm not understanding this whole --

QUESTION:

25

MR. GAUGHAN:

I mean, if it

I think it's right.
Well, if Justice Scalia says it's

right, it must be right.

QUESTION:

4

(Laughter.)

5

QUESTION:

No --

I don't necessarily accept that

6

argument, but the -- I mean, do we understand this

7

correctly?
MR. GAUGHAN:

8

Well, my understanding of the

current court interpretations are that if the State's
10

provision is less than 10 days, they still allow the 20-

11

day grace period.

12

law controls.

13
14

We will take the position that State

Whatever State law says --

QUESTION:

And is that because of the definition

of perfected?

15

MR. GAUGHAN:

16

QUESTION:

That is correct.

In other words, assuming Justice

17

Ginsburg's State with 10 days, if it's 15 days, it simply

18

can't be perfected under State law.

20

MR. GAUGHAN:

What the State statutes at

issue --

21

QUESTION:

I mean, is that the argument?

22

MR. GAUGHAN:

Well, the argument, Justice

23

Kennedy, I believe is that under State law there is a

24

period of time within which a creditor can perfect its

25

lien, and if it performs the required, stated

QUESTION:

And if it doesn't do that, then it's

not perfected within the meaning of the Federal statute.

But it could still be --

No, but it is perfected.

1

that typical of State laws?
MR. GAUGHAN:

2

Justice Stevens, to my knowledge,

3

there are at least 20 States that have that provision in

4

their State statutes.
QUESTION:

5
6

In all of those States, the 20-day

Federal period has no meaning?
MR. GAUGHAN:

7

Well, in seven of those States the

8

perfection-back period is more than 20 days.

9

21 days, 30 days, 60 days.

10

There are seven States that

have those provisions.
QUESTION:

11
12

It's either

Why would Congress need the 20-day

provision at all under your reading?
MR. GAUGHAN:

13

Well, of course, a vehicle loan is

14

a different animal than a regular secured transaction.

15

a regular, secured transaction the security agreement, the

16

note, the financing statement is all executed at the same

17

time.

consummation of the loan transaction.

Therefore, there is no delay.

In

It's signed upon

On a vehicle loan, particularly with this type

20

of transaction that involves dealer paper, where the buyer

21

goes to the dealership, they don't ask who's going to make

22

the loan.

23

arranges the financing, and the package is sent on to a

24

lender, so there is inherent delay built into that system

25

from the outset.

They just ask to buy the car, and the dealer

So the 20-day might make sense, I suppose, in a

1
2

commercial transaction or a regular consumer goods-type

3

transaction, where you have a financing statement that

4

might need to be filed, but -QUESTION:

5

Oh, I don't understand your answer,

6

because you're saying there's one category of transactions

7

which typically are performed immediately.

8

MR. GAUGHAN:

9

QUESTION:

Correct.

So there's really no delay.

There's

10

a second category of transactions, because of the delay

11

you need a relation-back period.

12

MR. GAUGHAN:

13

QUESTION:

That's correct.

It seems to me in that category, if

14

the State law always controls, the 20-day Federal period

15

doesn't serve any function at all.
MR. GAUGHAN:

16

Well, the 20-day period, of

17

course, establishes when the security interest must be

18

perfected.

19

perfected when State law says it's perfected, so if it's

20

perfected within State law, within that 20-day period,

21

it's perfected under the statute.

22

23
24
25

Then in the same section the statute says it's

QUESTION:

So you say the 20-day requirement has

no independent significance.
MR. GAUGHAN:

I would say that the 20-day

requirement established by Congress simply requires that

the security interest be perfected within 20 days.
If State law in turn says that the transaction

is deemed perfected as of day 1, it's still perfected

within that 20-day period.

QUESTION:

It's just on day 1 of the

No, but nothing is gained that would

7

not be gained by having the general 10-day period.

8

long as State law says it relates back to day 1, or

9

sometime within the first 10 days, then nothing was

As

10

accomplished.

No change in the law of any practicality

11

that I can see was accomplished by providing the second

12

20-day period for these kinds of loans.

13

MR. GAUGHAN:

14

QUESTION:

Why did Congress do it?

15

QUESTION:

Well -- then I don't understand this.

And I would concede that.

16

I read an amicus brief -- it's quite possible I don't, by

17

the way.

18

In an amicus brief it said there are 23 States

19

that have no relation-back, so I thought that those

20

States, those 23 States, I don't know what their

21

perfection laws provide, but some of those 23 States could

22

say that a secured interest is perfected at the time of

23

filing, and that filing takes place up to 20 days later,

24

and under the earlier law, that would not have worked,

25

because you had to do it within 10 days.

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

So I thought the point of this 20-day period was

1

2

in respect to those 23 States, to make certain that their

3

perfection laws applied and that a secured interest that

4

corresponded to and was consistent within those 23 States

would trump the trustee's effort to get the property back.

It is correct.

All right.

Then that gives meaning

to this.
Now, your point is that whether you win or you

17

lose it has meaning, as I take it.

18

additional point that if a State which has a statute that

19

says it is perfected beyond the 20-day period, of which

20

there are only seven --

21

MR. GAUGHAN:

22

QUESTION:

Now, you're making an

Correct.
-- that that State also says, by the

23

way, you are to consider it as having been perfected much

24

earlier, on day 1, then it is for purposes of the Federal

25

statute perfected earlier, within the 20-day period.

MR. GAUGHAN:

QUESTION:

5

MR. GAUGHAN:

Correct.

That's your argument.
Correct.

All right, then --go ahead.
And, of course, under the Missouri

6

scheme, then, if the lien is perfected within the 30-day

7

period, the lien relates back to day 1.
If that is the case, there is no transfer on

8

9
10

account of an antecedent debt, or the enabling loan
provision would certainly apply.

11

Two circuit courts of appeal have followed this

12

line of reasoning, In re Hesser out of the Tenth Circuit,

13

In re Busenlehner out of the Eleventh Circuit.
QUESTION:

14

May I ask you to amplify on your

15

answer to Justice Breyer, because it was my understanding

16

that Congress was responding to what the majority of the

17

States were doing.

18

10 days.

19

Now, Justice Breyer recited something from a friend of the

20

court brief that apparently said that most States don't

21

have a relation-back, or over 20 States don't have any

22

relation-back.

23

That is, they had a period longer than

They had a 20-day period, and it related back.

MR. GAUGHAN:

Well, I think it all began under

Of course, back then the trustee had to

that the debtor was insolvent, and we didn't have the 90-

2

day presumption period.
QUESTION:

3
4

Well, let's just -- is it true or not

that some 20-odd States have no relation-back period?
MR. GAUGHAN:

5

The 20-odd States, it's true that

6

they don't have a specific relation-back period that says

7

it's back-dated to day 1.

17
18

Mr. Gaughan, between what you describe as the grace period

19

in the Uniform Commercial Code and a provision

20

specifically saying there's a relation-back?
MR. GAUGHAN:

21

It's a very minute difference, of

22

course, because one simply says that there is a grace

23

period within which if certain steps are taken the lien is

24

perfected.

25

taken the perfection is back-dated to day 1.

7

QUESTION:

So --

8

QUESTION:

My understanding of the old

9

Bankruptcy Act was that the shorter time -- it was that

10

the State law could shorten the Federal period but never

11

extend it, and now you're arguing that it works just in

12

reverse, that the State law can extend it but not shorten

13

it, if that's --

14

MR. GAUGHAN:

And I would agree, under section

15

60, I believe it was, of the old act a creditor had 21

16

days within which to perfect its lien unless the short --

18

However, in 1978, when the Bankruptcy Code was

Bankruptcy Commission that that 21-day period be left

intact without regard to whether or not it was purchase

presumption of solvency, et cetera, so there was an

2

overhaul of the preference provisions, but without comment

3

Congress said, at least in 1978, that the security

4

interest had to be perfected within 10 days of attachment,

5

and then in the '84 amendments they stated that it had to

6

be perfected within 10 days of the debtor receiving

7

possession of the property.
Then, finally, in the 1994 amendments Congress

8

9

stated that the lien had to be perfected within 20 days of

10

the debtor receiving possession of the property, so it's

11

hard to tell by looking at the old act what significance

that had on the current statute.

understand that's being revised.

18

Most States have adopted, I believe, a 20-day

20

model was what was used when Congress revamped the

21

Bankruptcy Code in '78.

QUESTION:

And if I think that what the U.C.C.

does is indistinguishable from a relation-back provision,

24

then the number of States that have such a relation-back

right?
MR. GAUGHAN:

Correct, but the seven was the

3

number of States that had a period of time beyond 20 days,

4

greater than the 20-day period, so we have one with 21

5

days, I think there's four with 30 --

6

QUESTION:

Oh, beyond -- I see.

I see.

I see.

7

So even if I consider all the U.C.C. States to be

there are a number of States apparently that give you 20

MR. GAUGHAN:

Presumably, then, State law practices were to be

Congress must have thought that otherwise it was going to

MR. GAUGHAN:

Justice Ginsburg, I would concede

5

that.

Of course, vehicle perfection loans are not routine

They would be outside the normal considerations for

7

this kind of transaction, because in a normal loan -- and

8

in fact I think Collier on Bankruptcy noted that after the

1994 amendments, that's the end of the issue.

If you file

In the Eleventh Circuit decision of Busenlehner,

it had a statute much like the Missouri statute, the one

we refer to as a relation-back statute, and that was a

20

Georgia State law that allowed the lien to be deemed

21

perfected as of the day of creation if certain steps were

22

taken within 20 days.

23

In that case, the loan was obtained on March 31

The court found, of course, that although it was

2

beyond the 10-day period established in 547(c) (3)

4

subsection (B), the -- (e)(1)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code

5

incorporates State law, and under Georgia State law the

6

lien was perfected as of the day of its creation.

7

Therefore, there was no -- actually, they ruled that

8

therefore they were entitled to the enabling loan

exception, 547(c) (3) .
The other case, the Hesser case, came out of

10
11

Oklahoma.

They had a 15-day period of time within which

12

to perfect, and in that case I believe the loan originated

13

on April 16 of 1990 and the physical act of perfection

14

occurred on Ap -- or May 1, 1990, and then 18 days later

15

the debtor filed bankruptcy.

16

That was beyond the 10-day grace period, but

17

nonetheless, by interpreting Oklahoma law, the court noted

18

that under State law it was perfected as of day 1.

19

Therefore, that court held there was no transfer for or on

20

account of an antecedent debt under 547(b)(2), and that

21

they could claim the enabling loan exception under

22

547(c) (3) .

If we were to adopt further reasoning in this

case, we could also say the transfer occurred outside the

the intention was to bring the preference provisions more

So if we have a State that says it's perfected,

Is that, in essence, your position?

those steps would be to perfect, but as to whether you

were actually perfected within the time frame that

would look to Federal law, not the State.

QUESTION:

And so in a State like Massachusetts,

Prior to 1994, there was a problem.

The problem

2

was cases such as In re Burnette, that recognized the

3

congressional intent of a uniform national time period,

4

but instead chose a perceived public policy of favoring

5

that one creditor who had done everything right under

6

State law but had failed to perfect within the time frame

7

allowed by the Bankruptcy Code.

8

9

One purpose of preference law is to avoid the
pitfalls of secret liens.

Any creditor who fails to

10

disclose their lien in a timely and proper manner loses

11

their ability to enforce that lien against the world.

12

If they take the proper steps to attach their

13

security interest as between the debtor and themselves,

14

they have some protection, but if they fail to take the

15

steps in the time frame prescribed by the statute, whether

16

it be State law if you're in the State realm or bankruptcy

17

law, if you happen to be in a bankruptcy setting, because

18

it's a uniform Federal policy, then they lose their

19

ability to enforce that lien against the bankruptcy estate

20

in the Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 or Chapter 11 if there's a

preference proceeding filed.

point and asserts that State law relation-back statutes do

not affect the time of transfer pursuant to section 547,

to which Senator Sasser replied, and I quote, Federal

uniformity is key to the date on which the debtor receives

possession of such property, which then activates the

running of the 20-day period under section 547.

whatever question came up.
But it is significant to me what that situation

4

was, because if these two were primary movers of the whole

thing, then of course it doesn't reflect their views as

much as it reflects an entire community of people trying

If, on the other hand, it's a particular Senator

That simply isn't true.

Our interpretation

There are seven with grace periods longer than

date of the transfer be deemed the date of perfection.

3

Congress realized there was a problem, that sometimes

there could be a delay with enabling loan creditors, so it

gave them an extra 10 days, for a total of 20, and said,

It's a -- since it's a Chapter 13,

section 1325(b), that means that during the life of her

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL P. GAUGHAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GAUGHAN:

The facts in this particular case, the loan was

obtained on August 17, 1994, and the loan was in the

7

amount of $14,300, I believe.
The debtor took possession of the car in this

8
9

case the same day, but it is not unusual for a debtor to

10

take a test drive, for instance, at a dealership, to take

11

a car home, so the possession could start before the loan

12

is even consummated.

In this case, it occurred on the

Department of Revenue's record showed that it wasn't

after the transaction.

However, the

MR. GAUGHAN:

I was just trying to point out

2

that there is an inherent delay built into vehicle

3

perfections.

4

It's not like signing a financing statement.

5

With the financing statement there is no notice to the

6

world until it's recorded.

7

statement three different times on the same collateral,

8

but with a car there is a title that actually follows that

particular item of collateral, so it's very difficult to

You could file a financing

pledge that three or four times over.
The notice, there's no problem with notice to
the world because you can't falsify that information.
That's all I have.

If there's any other

questions -CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, Mr Gaughan.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 1:55 p.m., the case in the aboveentitled matter was submitted.)
