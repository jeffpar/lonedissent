ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LONG:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

11

â€”

We'll hear argument

The issue in this case is whether Federal courts

12

have jurisdiction to decide interbank claims for damages

13

under the Expedited Funds Availability Act and its

14

implementing regulations.

"H
i';

15

In the civil liability section of the act, which

16

is codified at 12 United States Code, section 4010,

17

Congress provided in subsection (d) that any action under

18

this section may be brought in Federal court or State

19

court.

20

In subsection (f) of Section 4010, Congress

21

provided for liability

22

for violation of rules governing the interbank check

23

payment system promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board.

24

The natural reading of this statutory language

25

under this subsection for damages

is that banks have an action under subsection (f) for

1

violations of the check-processing rules, and Federal

2

courts have jurisdiction to decide such actions under

3

subsection (d).

4

Congress placed subsection (f) in the civil

5

liability section of the statute, section 4010 provides

6

that depositor claims under subsection (a) maybe brought

7

in Federal court, and

8

Congress intended interbank

-Mr. Long, is there any possibility

11

that Congress intended the regulations promulgated under

12

subsection (f) to be enforced under the Uniform Commercial

13

Code some way?

14

MR. LONG:

We think that's not a possible

15

interpretation here.

16

with the language of the statute, which says, liability

17

under this subsection, that is, liability under Federal

18

law rather than liability under State law.

19

First of all, it's not consistent

Also, it would be highly unusual for Congress to

20

provide for liability for damages under a Federal statute

21

for a violation of Federal standards and rules, and yet

22

not provide for a Federal cause of action.

23

particularly unusual in this context, where Congress

24

clearly provided that depositors have a cause of action in

25

Federal court sometimes for very small claims, for claims

It would be

of as little as $100, and the much larger interbank claims
we think ought to be treated the same.
QUESTION:

Mr. Long, would it make any

substantive difference whether Federal courts had
jurisdiction under section 4010 immediately, or whether
they had it only indirectly under section 1331 of title
28?
MR. LONG:

I think the short answer is no.

Those are two routes to the same conclusion that Federal
courts have jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

I take it, in line with your answer

to Justice O'Connor, the board has promulgated regulations
that require that the checks be honored with diligence and
in good faith.

Those, I take it, are Federal standards to

be interpreted as a matter of Federal common law.
MR. LONG:

Yes, Justice Kennedy, they're Federal

standards, and they really are a substantial change in
this area.

When Congress passed this act, it federalized

to a substantial extent an area that had been an area of
State law, and the Federal standards that the Federal
Reserve Board has adopted under Regulation CC do impose
significant new obligations on banks, including a duty of
expeditious return of checks.
QUESTION:

If the board had determined that it

should be the one to determine what is good faith, and

1

that it should adjudicate these claims, could it have set

2

up an adjudicative mechanism under the existing statute,

3

or do you think additional authority would be required for

4

that?

5

MR. LONG:

I think additional authority would be

6

required.

7

Courts are not quick to imply agency authority to

8

adjudicate private claims for damages, particularly in a

9

context, and we're in that context here --

10

Under this Court's decision in Coit v. FSLIC

QUESTION:

And there's no statutory mechanism

11

for review, for judicial review of any such

12

administrative --

13

MR. LONG:

That's right.

Congress said nothing

14

about what procedure should be followed, said nothing

15

about judicial review, and in other areas where the

16

Federal Reserve does have enforcement authority and

17

adjudicatory authority, Congress was quite careful -- this

18

is in 12 U.S.C. section 1818 -- to spell out the

19

procedural requirements and to provide for judicial

20

review.

21

QUESTION:

Well, we have an Administrative

22

Procedure Act which does all of that.

I mean, most

23

agencies that conduct both adjudication and rule-making

24

don't have specialprovisions.

25

obstacle, is it?

That's not a

real

1

MR. LONG:

Well, I agree that presumptively

2

under the APA there would be judicial review, but under a

3

decision such as Coit, where Congress has demonstrated

4

that when it wants an agency to adjudicate --

5

QUESTION:

That's a question of whether --

6

whether we should interpret the statute in such a way as

7

to give the board the authority, but if it -- if the board

8

has the authority, there's really no problem about what

9

procedures it would have to use, is there?

10

MR. LONG:

Well, there would be a problem about

11

what procedures the agency would use.

12

presumptively judicial review under the Administrative

13

Procedure Act, but courts are supposed to be careful about

14

telling the agency what --

15

QUESTION:

There would be

But that's not all that the

16

Administrative Procedure Act contains.

17

rather specific provisions concerning the procedures the

18

agency has to use, right?

19

MR. LONG:

It also contains

Yes, I agree with that, but again,

20

the Coit decision says that in the context where Congress

21

has been quite specific and precise and explicit about

22

giving adjudicatory authority to an agency to adjudicate

23

private claims, the Court will not infer that authority

24

where it's not been expressly given.

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Long, is it appropriate for us to

1

give any weight to the Fed's own view that it does not

2

have this adjudicatory authority?
MR. LONG:

3

Yes, I think it is, Justice Ginsburg.

4

The board's view that it lacks jurisdiction to decide

5

these claims is entitled to deference.
QUESTION:

6

Well, don't you think there's a

7

difference when the board is just speaking about its own

8

house, and when the board is not -- I mean, when the board

9

says, we don't have it, the board is also saying, you have

10

it, that is, the Federal courts.

I mean, that's as much

11

our bailiwick as it is the board's.

12

MR. LONG:

Well --

13

QUESTION:

That's different from the usual

14

deference situation when the board is just talking about

15

its own ox.

16

our ox, and it seems to me the courts ought to be able to

17

look after their own ox.

18

Here, it's talking about its own ox and also

MR. LONG:

I agree the two questions are closely

19

related.

20

have jurisdiction, I think there would be a serious

21

question about whether to defer, but here Congress

22

provided, I think in very clear language, that any action

23

under this section may be brought in Federal court.

24
25

If it were a question of whether Federal courts

QUESTION:

Well, there wouldn't just be a

serious question if the board purported to say that there

1

was Federal jurisdiction, there would be no deference at

2

all, I take it.
MR. LONG:

3

I would concede that, Mr. Chief

4

Justice, but here it's not a question of jurisdiction,

5

because we have subsection (d).

6

of whether there's an action under subsection (f), and

7

Congress did give a very broad grant of authority to the

8

agency to promulgate interbank liability rules under that

9

subsection.

At most, it's a question

I think certainly at a minimum the board's view

10
11

that it does not have the authority to adjudicate claims

12

for violations of those rules is entitled to deference.

13

would go a step further and say that the board's view that

14

there is an action under subsection (f) is also a matter

15

that the Court could properly defer to the agency.

I

The text of section 4010 is consistent with the

16
17

purpose of the statute.

18

with expediting customer access to deposited funds, and to

19

achieve that goal, it legislated funds availability

20

schedules, and it required banks to disclose their funds

21

availability policies to customers and also required banks

22

to begin paying interest promptly, but Congress was also

23

concerned with speeding up the interbank check payment

24

system.

25

Congress was primarily concerned

Congress recognized that the slowness of the

1

system was a principal reason for the lengthy holds on

2

checks, and it also recognized that if it required banks

3

to make deposited funds available more quickly but did

4

nothing about the slowness of the interbank payment

5

system, banks would be exposed to a risk of loss of the

6

checks ultimately were not paid.

7

f

Now, Congress addressed this more technical

8

issue about how to improve the check payment system not by

9

legislating a particular solution, but by giving the

10

Federal Reserve Board broad authority to regulate the

11

system.

12

It directed the board to consider a variety of

13

possible improvements to the system which are set out in

14

12 U.S.C. section 4008, it gave the Federal Reserve a

15

broad grant of authority to regulate any aspect of the

16

payment system, also in section 4008, and in 4010(f) it

17

gave the board an additional grant of authority to

18

establish liability rules for damages.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Long --

20

MR. LONG:

Yes.

21

QUESTION:

-- subsection (e) of 4010 says that

22

no provision of this section imposing any liability shall

apply to any act done or omitted in good faith in

conformity with any rule, regulation, or interpretation

25

thereof by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve

System.
Now,

2

in what context would the board have

3

occasion to interpret some of its rules and regulations

4

pertaining to these matters unless it is in the context of

5

adjudicating whether those rules or regulations have been

6

violated?
MR. LONG:

7

I think, Justice Scalia,

the Federal

8

Reserve would have authority to interpret its rules,

9

indeed,

and,

it's issued an extensive commentary to the rules

10

that accompanies them without conducting any

11

adjudications.

12

QUESTION:

Just issue interpretive bulletins?

13

MR. LONG:

Yes, Your Honor.

courts -- well,

17

MR. LONG:

18

But to return to purpose for a moment,

To that extent, yes,

I think so.
in giving

19

this additional grant in subsection (f) of authority not

20

only to regulate any aspect of the system but to impose

21

liability for damages,

22

there's no indication that Congress intended civil

rules to be adjudicated in a different forum,

differently from other civil liability claims under the

or handled

1

statute.

2

The Seventh Circuit held that interbank claims

3

should be adjudicated by the Federal Reserve Board.

4

are at least five reasons why that interpretation is not

5

correct.

First,

6

statute.

Congress authorized the Federal Reserve Board to

7

impose on or allocate among banks risk of loss and

8

liability, not to impose actual liability through

9

adjudication.

10

There

it doesn't fit with the language of the

That language is consistent with rule-

making .

11

Second,

it's inconsistent with the Coit

12

principle that we've discussed that authority to

13

adjudicate is not to be lightly inferred.

14

Third,

the administrative enforcement mechanisms

15

available to the Federal Reserve Board simply don't

16

include a mechanism for imposing liability for damages on

17

a private party.

18

orders,

19

provisions, but not authority to have an adjudicative

20

tribunal.

21

They have remedies for cease and desist

civil penalties,

the usual gamut of enforcement

Fourth is the deference that's owed to the

22

board's view that it lacks jurisdiction, and fifth is the

23

sort of fragmented adjudications that would result under

24

the court of appeals view.

25

Bank claims would go to an agency.

In fact,

1

there are several agencies that share authority for

2

enforcing this, so there could be intraagency

3

jurisdictional problems.
If a bank had a State law claim, presumably that

4
5

would go to State court.

6

arising out of the same set of facts, that could go to

7

Federal court or State court, and it seems quite unlikely

that Congress would have intended that sort of

fragmentation.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR

15

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

16

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

17
18

MR. MINEAR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

19

The civil liability provisions of the EFA act

20

indicate that Congress intended State and Federal courts

21

to have jurisdiction over both depositor and interbank

22

claims.

23

Section 4010(d) expressly provides that Federal

24

district courts and other courts of competent jurisdiction

25

may hear liability claims, and that jurisdictional

1

provision draws no distinction between depositor claims

2

and interbank claims.
Section 4010 does create two different causes of

3
4

action.

5

depositor claims, while subsection (f) authorizes the

6

board to promulgate or establish rules that apply to

7

interbank claims, but that distinction makes no difference

8

with regard to Federal jurisdiction.

9

Subsection (a) establishes rules that apply to

Both subsections create a legal right to

10

redress, and both subsections -- and a party who can state

11

a cause of action under either subsection is entitled to

12

invoke the Federal court's jurisdiction under subsection

13

(d) .

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Minear, isn't it odd, the

'i
15

placement of this statute?

16

substantive provisions to be together,

17

then (d) to follow both of them.

18

MR. MINEAR:

You would expect the
(a) and (f), and

I think the answer to that is found

19

in the legislative history of the act, that when Congress

20

first provided the bills that -- the initial bills, both

21

the House and Senate bills, they provided a provision,

22

subsection (a), that covered any person, including

23

depository institutions.

24
25

In the formulation of the bill -- in the
formulation of the legislation, Congress realized that the
14

1

interbank question required special expertise, and it

2

therefore added subsection (f) later, and also added

3

language to (a) that excluded depository institutions from

4

among the plaintiffs that might invoke that cause of

5

action, so the placement actually reflects the genesis of

6

the legislation, and that is the reason why it actually

7

was added later in the statute.
QUESTION:

8

9
10

It might have been better drafting,

then, if they switched to put the jurisdictional provision
at the end.
MR. MINEAR:

11

It certainly would have.

It would

12

have been better organized, but that still doesn't detract

13

from the substance of the subsections that we're

14

discussing.

15

Now, the United States also disagrees with t he

16

court of appeals' conclusion that a agency tribunal should

17

resolve interbank claims.

18

As this Court has indicated in cases such as

19

Coit v. FSLIC, when Congress decides to allow agencies to

20

adjudicate private disputes, it says so explicitly, and

21

there is no such explicit statement in this statute at

22

all.

23

power or authority to adjudicate claims.

24
25

The EFA act nowhere states that the board has the

The board's regulations reflect that limitation.
The board has discerned within section 4010(f) a

delegation of authority to establish liability rules, but

k,

it has not discerned any delegation of authority to
3

establish standards or to establish -- or to create a

4

agency tribunal for adjudicating interbank disputes.

5

Instead, the board's regulations recognize that the

6

customary mechanism should be employed in this situation,

7

and the customary mechanism is a judicial action in

8

Federal or State court.

9

N

V

The United States also disagrees with

10

respondent's suggestion that Congress intended that State

11

courts would have exclusive jurisdiction over interbank

12

disputes.

13

State courts have concurrent jurisdiction over depositor

14

claims, and there's no basis for drawing a distinction

15

with regard to interbank claims.

Respondent acknowledges that Federal courts and

-i

16

Congress authorized the board to regulate the

17

payment system in order to improve the interbank check

18

collection process, and it would be quite anomalous to

19

provide Federal court jurisdiction over depositor claims

20

but not interbank claims.

21

There is simply no basis for providing a Federal

22

forum for depositor claims no matter how small, while

23

denying a Federal forum for interbank claims, no matter

24

how large, and no matter what impact they might have on

25

the interbank payment system.

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Minear, do you agree that it

2

doesn't make any difference whether the Federal court has

3

jurisdiction under 4010 or under section 1331 of title 28?
MR. MINEAR:

4

I agree with Mr. Long that

5

ultimately it leads to the same place.

6

the jurisdiction question should be resolved within the

7

four corners of the EFA act, because Congress has

8

specifically addressed the question here, but 1331

9

jurisdiction would be consistent as well, and in fact

10

section 1331 indicates the general tendency, at least

11

since the Civil War, for Congress to provide a Federal

12

forum to vindicate or address Federal rights.

13

We believe that

In sum, we believe that the court of appeals

14

erred in concluding that there was no Federal jurisdiction

15

in this case.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT G. EPSTEEN

20

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. EPSTEEN:

21
22

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

23

I'd like to start out to clarify one point here,

24

and that is that Regulation CC is not promulgated pursuant

25

to 611(f).

611(f), when it talks about rule-making in

1

that title, is not talking about the kind of regulations

2

that are involved in Regulation CC, which is the

3

regulation that the suit sought to enforce, and I call the

4

Court's attention to a portion of the legislative debate

5

which is quoted at pages 17 and 18 of our brief.
And if I may just read one paragraph of the

6
7

joint conference report, which points out that it is

8

section 609 where these regulations would be promulgated

9

under, not under 611(f), and it -- in the report, and I'm

10

quoting from page 18 of my brief, the report says, for

11

example, under this subsection -- and they're referring to

12

611(f)

13

liability on depository institutions for risks of losses

14

incurred by other depository institutions, their

15

accountholders or other owners or holders of a check due

16

to a depository institution's failure to handle the check

17

in accordance with regulations imposed under section 609.

18

That is 12 U.S.C. 4008, so --

QUESTION:

-- the Federal Reserve may allocate or impose

-4 *

I'm not sure that that proves your

20

point, because it speaks -- as you were quoting it, it

21

speaks of allocating risks, not of imposing liability,

22

which sounds to me as though what it's talking about under

23

(f) is the promulgation of rules which determine who will

24

bear the liability, i.e. the risk of loss, and not a rule

25

which actually imposes liability in a -- or an act of the

agency which imposes liability in a specific case.
MR. EPSTEEN:

Justice Souter, my point being is

3

in this case the claim was that Midwest Bank failed to

4

exercise ordinary care as required by 12 C.F.R. 229.38,

5

that that rule, which is part of Regulation CC, is not

6

promulgated under 611(f).

7

QUESTION:

That's promulgated under 4008.

Okay, so you were not quoting that

8

language to show that, or to prove your claim that (f) is

9

an adjudicatory authorization.

10

MR. EPSTEEN:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. EPSTEEN:

No.

I was --

That was a separate point.
I was -- right.

I was quoting

13

this language to point out that if there is rule-making

14

authority, and 611(f), the language of 611(f) doesn't talk

15

specifically about rule-making authority but the heading

16

or the title to it does, and if you view 611(f) to be

17

ambiguous so that you resort to the caption or the title

18

of that subsection, then you would also look to

19

extrinsicate such as the legislative history --

QUESTION:

Well, if you do get into the

21

legislative history, I suppose you do rely on the words,

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

different from allocating risks, I suppose you say.

the language and the structure of 611, subpart 6511(a),

Why not just look up above to (e),

or made in good faith in conforming with any rule,

that make it very clear that they have rule-making under

I think the rule-making is under

QUESTION:

Did the board purport to be applying

either 611 or 609 when it issued Regulation CC?

one or the other?

MR. EPSTEEN:

Did it

I don't believe it is specific as

to which section it is relying on in the act.

QUESTION:

I mean, just -- I'm not certain what

17

the relevance of this argument is to the case question in

18

front of us, but if it is relevant, looking at 609, and I

19

just looked at it briefly, it sounds as if 609 says you

20

can promulgate regulations to tell banks what to do, and

21

it sounds as if 611(f) is saying you can do another thing,

22

too.

23

The other thing is to impose liability of

24

certain kinds upon them to certain people when they don't

25

do what you told them to do under 609, and if that's so,

on its face, Regulation CC seems to be a regulation that

2

talks about imposing liability for failing to do something

3

that some other regulation probably told them to do, so on

4

its face, Regulation CC looks as if it comes after --

5

under 6

Now, I mean, that's just a very quick look at

6

7

it, and because I hadn't looked at that before, but what's

8

your response to that?

9

MR. EPSTEEN:

Well, I agreed with Your Honor

10

until you got to the last part, with all due respect.

11

believe it is the prescribing, or the passage of the

12

promulgation of the regulations comes under 609.

QUESTION:

I

The liability part -- for example, it

says, a bank that fails to act in good faith under this

subpart may be liable for other damages.

about standard of care, and it talks about liability, so

7

why isn't the liability part of CC being promulgated under

Then it talks

?
MR. EPSTEEN:

Because, as that they point out, I

20

believe, in the legislative history, that Congress

21

intended all of the regulation, of these regulations to be

22

promulgated under 609, that I think the rules that they're

23

talking about are perhaps rules for procedures for

imposing liability.

QUESTION:

Mr. Epsteen, is this your second view

2

of the case?

3

by the Seventh Circuit panel on its own motion, and you

4

had not questioned Federal court jurisdiction up until the

5

Seventh Circuit.

6

As I understand it, this argument was raised

MR. EPSTEEN:

That's true.

We had -- I'm

7

embarrassed to say that we had not raised the argument on

8

our own when we should have.

11

QUESTION:

So you're kind of fleshing out the

rather terse Seventh Circuit explanation of what it did.
MR. EPSTEEN:

Well, when the Seventh Circuit

12

raised the issue and we looked at it, we became convinced

13

that the Seventh Circuit was correct that there was no

14

Federal question jurisdiction.

15

One of the things is that there have been

16

Federal regulations for some years governing interbank

17

check disputes.

19

been around since October of 1980.

It's

When we started looking at it, we were unable to

21

find a single case under Regulation J or Regulation CC

22

where the Federal courts had found Federal subject matter

23

jurisdiction under 1331 to enforce a claim for violation

24

of Regulation J or Regulation CC, that regulation -- but

25

we were able to find cases where under State law, and

:

we've cited a couple as examples in our brief, where,
under the Uniform Commercial Code, which incorporates the

Federal regulations as part of State law -- under 4-103 of

4

the Uniform Commercial Code these become part of the State

4

jurisdiction but it's in the agency in the first instance,

or are you saying that the only forum for these interbank

6

disputes is the State court?

7

MR. EPSTEEN:

Well, I think there would be

8

jurisdiction within the agency if the agency sought to

9

exercise it, but since the agency has declined to exercise

10

it, our point is that there certainly is still a forum in

11

which these claims could be adjudicated in the State

12

courts.

Mr. Epsteen, is that indeed your

QUESTION:

So if the agency chose to exercise

that authority, where would the next stop be?

Well, I think the agency's

adjudication would then, if it decided -- and I think

under (f) it can pass and promulgate some rules for its

it chose to adjudicate -- I mean, if you're right in what

you answered before, that the agency if it wanted to could

Justice Stevens' question to be that if it were brought in

part of the State law, they become agreements under the

view it is not a cause of action that is a judicially
enforceable cause of action, the way I understand the term
cause of action, and -QUESTION:

MR. EPSTEEN:

Well, I think -- I think there are

times when clearinghouses -- and in my experience, I have
seen situations where clearinghouses administratively deal
with claims of banks without a hearing based on written
submissions, but I believe that this is not a Federal
cause of action that is enforceable in Federal courts, as
cause of action is talked about, let's say in Davis v.
Passman, which is cited in the Government's brief.
I don't think that Congress has given banks the
right to bring an action under this act specifically,

QUESTION:

You have a different spin on it than

3

the Seventh Circuit, because as I read the Seventh

4

Circuit's opinion, the Seventh Circuit was pretty sure

5

about the Federal Reserve System but not so sure about

6

State courts, because it said, or perhaps in State court,

7

so the Seventh Circuit seemed to think of this as an

8

agency adjudication, correct?

9

MR. EPSTEEN:

That's -- they did, and the

10

initial decision of the Seventh Circuit didn't refer to

11

the State courts, and there was some concern that they

12

might have been blocking out the State courts, and then on

13

rehearing they revised their opinion and put their phrase

14

in, oh, perhaps in State courts.

15

QUESTION:

But -- so that theory, whatever it

16

was, is quite different from yours, because theirs did not

17

turn on the State courts as being the adjudicator.

18

had a question mark about State courts.

19

MR. EPSTEEN:

They

They had a question mark about

20

State court, they -- but they believed that the board

21

could administratively decide interbank.disputes, that's

22

true, but I don't believe that they create a type of cause

23

of action that would be a judicially enforceable cause of

24

action that would trigger 611(d).

It's kind of interesting, because

there must be zillions of these transactions, and so

scarce litigation.

I guess the banks normally work these

MR. EPSTEEN:

Well, one of the things we did in

13

preparing for this case, Your Honor, was went to the

computer research and punched in the regulations, and to

case where there was Federal question subject matter

MR. EPSTEEN:

Yes, since 1980, although

Regulation J was amended a few times and got certainly

more substance in '85 and '86, and one of the interesting

parts of Regulation J in '86 is that the Federal Reserve

Board, while these were all being enforced through State

8

courts, said there's one area of nonuniformity which is a

9

statute of limitations, and in 1986 they put a 2-year

10

statute of limitations in Regulation J so that when it was

enforced through the Uniform Commercial Code in all the

State courts, there would be a uniform statute of

limitations.

under 28 1367(a) has been enacted.

I believe that there is not a problem there.

If

an individual or a person other than a bank brings a suit

in the Federal court, and then there is a dispute between

6

two banks, it could be brought in under 1367(a) of title

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

passed, the Federal Reserve Board had no administrative

law judges at all.

when it needed them.

MR. LONG:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Does the fact that they get their

administrative law judges out of a pool cut one way or

4

another in this case?

Well, I think it emphasizes how

unusual it would be to assume that Congress intended the

agency to start adjudicating all these interbank claims.

they need a place to go to work them out.

MR. LONG:

Justice Scalia, you had mentioned

6

4010(e) in the interpretations of the board.

7

that other statutes such as the Truth in Lending Act have

8

similar provisions, but it's -- the agency has no

adjudicatory authority under those statutes.

I'm told

On the interplay between 609 and 611, I think

11

Justice Breyer I agree with completely.

12

board authority to regulate any aspect of the payment

13

system, but the additional authority to promulgate rules

14

imposing liability for damages goes beyond just

15

prescribing or proscribing behavior, and that's where you

need the 4010(f) .

lack of lawsuits in Federal court under other board

How --

MR. LONG:

Well, Regulation J has been around

21

for quite a long time.

There has been significant

22

litigation in Federal court under Regulation J.

23

Generally, Regulation J regulates the

24

relationship of Federal Reserve banks to other banks in

check processing, and there's a statute, 12 U.S.C section

632, that provides whenever a Federal Reserve bank is a

2

defendant or a party the action is deemed to arise under

3

Federal law, so there are those cases, and when the

4

Federal Reserve is in the case, as it frequently is, that

5

solves all the jurisdictional problems.
This particular provision in Regulation J

6

7

requiring banks to notify the depository bank if it's a

8

big check and they were returning it only came in in 1985.

9

It was shortly before the act, which was 1987, so there

that.

It's concurrent.

2

And finally, on the titles, it is true that 4010

3

says civil liability and 4010(a) says civil liability, but

4

if you look at 4009, it says administrative enforcement,

5

and 4009(a) also says administrative enforcement, so there

seems to be a pattern here of repeating in the first
