ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. ABADY

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ABADY:

12

13
14

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case presents the question of whether a

15

Federal appellate court, sitting in diversity, may apply a

16

highly invasive State standard of review to overturn a

17

jury's findings on compensatory damages in the absence of

18

any error at trial, and after the district court judge has

1

considered and denied a Rule 5

20

motion.

This Court must reverse the Second Circuit's

21

decision for three principal reasons.

First, the Second

22

Circuit's decision to apply a State rather than Federal

23

standard of review violates the Seventh Amendment, the

24

Rules of Decision Act, and this Court's precedent, most

25

recently reaffirmed in a unanimous opinion in Browning3

MR. ABADY:

QUESTION:

recovery was allowed.
MR. ABADY:

10

Yes.

Yes.

State law controlled the

11

substantive law which governed the cause of action and the

12

elements that the jury could consider.

13

QUESTION:

Has the law in New York been

14

determined to limit tort recovery to amounts that are

reasonableness is a judicial determination by a reviewing

court, as it is in New York under CPLR 5501(c).

QUESTION:

5501(c)

It is not a substantive --

Okay, but what if it is coupled with

New York cases that say it must be reasonable --

13

MR. ABADY:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. ABADY:

Well --- as a matter of substantive law?
Well, I think that the critical

issue there is who defines what is reasonable.

that if, as in this case, it is a reviewing court that is

18

making the determination of what is reasonable --

QUESTION:

I think

I suppose initially the trial court

judge has to review that question and decide it.
What is the normal Federal appellate court

What is the standard of review?

do they -- they were looking at a motion for a new trial.

5

Is it whether the trial court abused its discretion in

6

denying the new trial?

7
8

MR. ABADY:

Is it no reasonable juror

Well, most of the circuits are --

many of the circuits are employing an abuse-of-discretion
standard, but the Seventh Amendment does not permit a

10

Federal appellate court from exercising review where the

11

claim is that the jury's verdict was excessive, or --

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Abady, do you know of any State

13

that does not have a rule that damages must be reasonable?

14

In other words, is the New York rule something distinctive

15

about New York law?

16
17

MR. ABADY:

Well, there is something distinctive

about 5501(c) in New York law --

QUESTION:

MR. ABADY:

What is that?
-- and that is that under New York

20

is the highest court in the State of New York --

QUESTION:

But Mr. Abady, didn't New York

21

specifically change its law for the express purpose of

22

getting a lid on damages?

23

MR. ABADY:

Well, not a lid, and that's I think

24

a critical distinction.

and to move the award up or down, and --

QUESTION:

In this very field, what we've seen

is a lowering of excessive verdicts, and what's startling

10

verdicts that are widely out of line with what you could

court,

15

decision that the Gasperini court relied on, did,

16

under an Erie analysis indicate that its decision to apply

17

State law was a function of the Erie test, but there is a

18

threshold question that must be addressed before one can

19

proceed to the Erie considerations, and that is,

a constitutional provision at play here?

MR. ABADY:

1

2

That's correct.

That's correct,

but - -

3

QUESTION:

And yet you're arguing that because

4

of Federal procedure, you can get a remedy in the Federal

5

court much larger than you could get in State court on the

6

State-created right?

7

MR. ABADY:

No. What I'm saying is that because

8

the Seventh Amendment applies, the Supremacy Clause

9

prevents application of the State standard of review, not

10

the substantive law.

11

the cause of action, and which determines the elements

12

that the jury may consider in arriving at their

13

determination is a function of State law, but the standard

14

of review, as this Court held in Browning-Ferris, in

15

Donovan v. Penn Shipping, and in Byrd v. Blue Ridge, is a

16

function of fundamental Federal policy and the Seventh

17

Amendment.

18

QUESTION:

The substantive law which determines

Mr. Abady, you never got a chance,

19

really, to answer Justice O'Connor's question.

MR. ABADY:

What is

Well, the -- what I'm saying is,

22

where a new trial motion has been based on a claim for

23

excessiveness or weight of the evidence, the Seventh

24

Amendment prevents a Federal appellate court from

25

reviewing that determination.

9

QUESTION:

Do you think that's what Browning-

Ferris held?
MR. ABADY:

Well, I think Browning-Ferris

10

addressed a slightly different issue, but interestingly,

11

Browning-Ferris did indicate that this Court has never

12

held expressly that a Federal appellate court can exercise

13

review where weight of the evidence and excessiveness is

14

the claim and, in fact, it's been the precedent of this

15

Court for more than a century and a half, and a precedent

16

that has never been repudiated, that a Federal appellate

17

court cannot exercise that type of review.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

And what precedent is that you're

referring to?
MR. ABADY:

Specifically the cases begin with

21

Parsons v. Bedford up through Fairmount Glass.

There are

dozens of decisions which are collected in our brief on

But that is true.

There was some

MR. ABADY:

There was judicial review at the

QUESTION:

MR. ABADY:

Right.
The only way that a new trial

Let me ask you this.

There --

On the Federal

3

standard of appellate review, if the court of appeals

4

determined that no reasonable juror could have awarded the

5

amount of damages that it awarded at the trial, you say

6

the appellate court could not, based on that

7

determination, upset the verdict?

8

MR. ABADY:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

A court of appeals is -No reasonable juror could have done

it?
MR. ABADY:

A court of appeals is not in a

12

position, based on the restrictions of the Seventh

13

Amendment, to exercise that type of review --

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Abady, the district judge is,

15

however, and if you're stressing Federal procedure and the

16

Seventh Amendment, we have a tension here between the

17

award one can get in a State court and Federal procedure.

18

Isn't the logical answer to say, you have to take the

19

State law, but fit it into Federal procedure, and that

20

means the district judge has an obligation to do in the

21

Federal courts exactly what the appellate division would

22

do in the New York State courts.

23

MR. ABADY:

A district court judge is empowered

parties.

10

Never mind the State.

He might have thought that.

We don't --

We don't know what he

thought because he didn't write anything.
MR. ABADY:

11

Well, that's correct, he might have,

but there's no indication that he exercised his discretion

improperly.

15

What we have to look to is the record, to see if

the record actually supports his determination, and when

we look to the record in this particular case, what we see

MR. ABADY:

that judges should be more interventionist than the common

MR. ABADY:

No, I don't want to be misunderstood

for saying that --

Well, I thought --

-- exactly, Justice Scalia.

Isn't that the premise of the

that if New York chooses to allow its judges to be more

with is actually a State substantive provision, a State,

for example, that the cause of action, that under New York

law on a particular cause of action a plaintiff is not

entitled to more than $200,000 and the jury awards

Mr. Olson, if we were back in the era

conclusion that the jury did in this case, and it's clear,

in giving all deference to the decision of the jury and

all inferences in favor of the petitioner, that the

22

district judge should have done exactly what you said.

said, if -- no error of law appearing upon the record,

examination of the evidence, we may be of the opinion that

the jury should have rendered a verdict for a lesser

amount.

13

If the jury acted upon a gross mistake of facts,

remedy therefore rested with the court below under its

point.

Part of the common law was, and part of the

8

reverence that we have for the common law and the Framers

9

had for the common law was the fact that it was a

10

continuing evolutionary process by which justice would be

11

done, and in fact it would be very anomalous, and this

12

Court has said it, for the Framers of the Constitution to

13

have locked in a particular mode of procedure or forms of

14

practice.
QUESTION:

Well, wasn't it assumed, and haven't

we consistently assumed that if there was no clear

17

exemplification in American practice of what the common

law rule was, that the default rule was English common law

Isn't that the default position?

Yes.

referring to the Reexamination Clause, and not the first

that existed in 1791 applied only to the first half of the

Seventh Amendment but not somehow to the second half of

the Seventh Amendment.

It would have made no sense.

In fact, the forms of procedure by which jury

trial results were examined wasn't dependent upon any

particular practice or procedure.

clear, the idea of the new trial was for the purpose of

the preservation of the jury trial itself, and for the

purpose of preserving the confidence that the people would

have in this most elegant -- as he puts it, the new trial,

11

the motion for a new trial eliminates these inconveniences

12

which could occur as a result of errors or excesses, and

13

at the same time the motion for a new trial preserves

entire and renders perfect that most excellent method of

decision which is the glory of the English law.

the Examination Clause was the civil law procedure, where

to adopt the second part of the Seventh Amendment, but we

go by what they said, and what they said was, and

11

according to the rules of common law.
MR. OLSON:

And I'm suggesting there's no better

12

chronicle of the rules of common law that existed at that

13

time than Blackstone's Commentaries, written in 1768, and

14

he describes the rules of common law --

15

QUESTION:

Well, I'm sure that may be very

16

valuable, and perhaps that's governing, but we don't need

all this hype about how great it all is.

(Laughter.)

MR. OLSON:

Well, the reason that I mention that

is that Blackstone had a reason for putting that hype, as

21

you put it, in Chapter 24.

trial was something that was terrible, or something to be

avoided, or something that was an inroad on the trial by

jury trial that there would be these retrials.

The issue is whether he believed it

QUESTION:

The issue is whether he thought that

was action by an appellate, and whether he was correct in

thinking that that was action by an appellate court as

15

opposed to action by the trial court itself.

16

MR. OLSON:

He felt -- he felt first, and this

17

is the most important point of all, is that he felt that a

rehearing before another jury, to use his words, was as

little prejudice to either party as if it had never been

heard before.

21

instrumentality of the new trial was a valuable means of

protecting the system.

Mr. Olson, may I just detract you

from that for a moment and ask the kind of question that

Justice Scalia asked of Mr. Abady.

I think you're biting

10

off more than you need to here, and do you at least have,

11

as a second, as an alternate position that even if what

12

you're -- what Mr. Abady has argued is right for a

13

Federally created claim, this is an Erie matter, and

14

therefore the Federal court simply can't give awards that

15

you couldn't get in the State court across the street.

16

MR. OLSON:

I agree with that, and this Court

17

said it best, it seems to me, in the Guaranty trust case,

18

where it said the intent of the Erie decision was to

19

ensure that all cases of Federal court in diversity

jurisdiction, the outcome of the litigation in the Federal

21

court should be substantially the same as far as --

with a damage -MR. OLSON:

3

It would under no circumstances

change, or make the Seventh Amendment a dead letter unless

5

the judges were given the power to substitute their

judgment for that of the jury with respect to the amount

of damages.
QUESTION:

But they are.

As -- I

mean, the very existence of the Seventh Amendment, if the
10

States don't have it, will lead you to a difference

11

between the amount of money you're going to get in a

12

Federal court that has a jury trial by right and a State

13

court.

14

MR. OLSON:

I don't believe that that's correct,

15

Justice Scalia, based upon what happened in this case.

16

This is an example of a supervisorial function that will

17

send the case back to a new jury unless the petitioner
