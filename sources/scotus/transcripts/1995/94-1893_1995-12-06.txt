ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. WALLACE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The provision of the 1984 cable act that the

14

court of appeals invalidated in this case, section 533(b)

15

of title 47, addresses the special capacity for

16

anticompetitive conduct by local telephone companies in

17

providing cable television programming services.

18

That capacity stems from the telephone

19

companies' established situation as regulated monopolies,

20

and it is important to an understanding of the premises on

21

which the commission and Congress have acted over the past

22

25 years not to elide too quickly over what it has meant

23

for these companies to be regulated monopolies.

24
25

They have in the first place been given
exclusive franchises.

The Virginia statutory provision

involved in this case is set forth in footnote 17 of the

2

district court's opinion on page 77a of our appendix to

3

the petition, which protected them against competition in

4

providing the telephone services regulated on the basis of

5

recovery of costs and return of capital type of rate

6

regulation still the predominant and historically the only

7

form of rate regulation to which they've been subject in

8

providing telephone service.

9

They've been granted rights of way sometimes

10

with the exercise of the power of eminent domain to

11

construct poles and conduits and their expenses in doing

12

so have been included as part of their rate base, so at

13

the advent of modern cable television, when it was

14

replacing the old community antenna systems, they had not

15

only the capacity to provide wire service throughout the

16

communities they served, they had the wires in place to

17

virtually every residence and a capacity through their

18

Government-sponsored regulated monopolies to stifle the

19

development of any other competition in the provision of

20

cable television services.

21

I don't mean to suggest that any of this was in

22

any way improper.

Obviously, this served an important

23

public interest on the part of the local governments in

24

assuring that telephone service would be available

25

throughout their communities at a reasonable cost.

1

But the situation with which the commission and

2

Congress have been concerned is that not just through

3

their legitimate use of the advantage that they had were

4

they in a position to stifle the development of others in

5

providing these services, but they also would have the

6

capacity incentive to use unfair competitive methods.

QUESTION:

8

MR. WALLACE:

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace -Yes, sir.

All that is well and good, but to

10

date has that changed, and are cable companies competitive

11

with each other, or are they equally in the monopoly

12

position, and are we just talking about monopolists versus

13

monopolists?

14

MR. WALLACE:

Well, there have been franchises

IS

granted to the cable companies.

16

historical evolution of a provision --

17

QUESTION:

We're talking about an

I know it, but the evolution has

18

taken place.

19

industry is no longer at its infancy state, it is a

20

developed industry with over 90 percent saturation, right?

21

The -- as I understand it, the cable

MR. WALLACE:

Well, I not only do not deny it,

22

I'm not in a position to deny it, because it's part of the

23

basis of the commission's Third Report and Order, which

24

has been issued --

25

QUESTION:

Well, doesn't the Third Report, the

1

basis of the Third Report conflict with much of what

2

you've just said, as to the development ability of the

3

cable industry?

4

MR. WALLACE:

What I have said is more of a

5

historical nature in showing the development of regulation

6

in this field, and why the 1984 act with its provision for

7

good cause waivers, that was intended to have flexibility

8

so that the commission could adapt it to changing

9

situations in the industry and changing technologies, was

10

a legitimate response to the congressional concerns, which

11

were to try to nurture a multiplicity of voices in the

12

provision of these services and to prevent unfair --

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, if we're going to get

14

into history, wasn't it proposed to Congress and rejected

15

early in the history of cable to prevent cable from

16

becoming a monopoly by making the cable owners common

17

carriers only and preventing them from programming, which

18

would have made cable much more open to any kind of

19

programming not within the control of a single monopolist?

20

That was rejected, right?

21

MR. WALLACE:

22

QUESTION:

23

That was a --

So you have cable monopolies in 99

percent of localities now, is that right?

24

MR. WALLACE:

QUESTION:

The commission is undertaking --

Yes.

MR. WALLACE:

-- right now to try to do

something constructive about this -QUESTION:

And the Government is concerned about

monopoly power, having created this thing.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, we were -- the concern at

6

the outset with the 1970 commission study and regulations

7

that were then adopted by Congress was that the telephone

8

companies were in a position to preempt the entry of any

9

other players into this at all.

They were allowed to

10

enter into this business but not in their own service

11

areas where they had these artificial advantages as

12

monopolists.

13

The whole idea was to bring other players in,

14

with the telephone companies among those standing in the

15

wings as potential competitors.

16

longer view than -- the idea was, the motivating animation

17

of this was that otherwise no one else would ever get into

18

it, or there was a great danger of that.

19

QUESTION:

We're talking about a

Mr. Wallace, if the Government was

20

worried that telephone companies would engage in unfair

21

practices, why is it that the statute they passed just

22

prohibited video programming instead of video

23

transmission?

24

I mean, it just -- it's just so illogical to me.

QUESTION:

1

Why did they select the most speech-

2

restrictive approach, instead of saying we won't let phone

3

companies transmit these messages?

4
5

MR. WALLACE:

Well, we like to think of that as

a form of more narrowly tailoring the restraint to the --

8

QUESTION:

You mean, it's more narrowly tailored

to just prohibit speech?

9

MR. WALLACE:

To prohibit the conduct where

10

there would be the greatest incentive as an economic

11

matter for the telephone companies to engage in unfair

12

competitive practices, including discriminatory self

13

preference in the use of the essential facilities of the

14

poles and the conduits as well as the cross-subsidization

15

that is so very --

QUESTION:

MR. WALLACE:

18

How does that --- difficult to detect and

monitor.
QUESTION:

How does that work?

That is, the

20

thing I couldn't -- the -- in trying to understand this,

21

the point that you seem to be making now, which was the

22

point that I thought was the strongest for your side, was

23

contained in Professor Owen's reply affidavit, where I

24

think he agreed with Professor Kahn that really this

25

problem of cross-subsidy, which seems to me your only

rationale, doesn't really exist in respect to cross­

2

subsidizing programming.

3

I.e., the programming, you can't easily hide the

4

cost of programming in the cost of your telephone service.

5

I mean, it's not very likely a regulator would think,

right, the cost of producing Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten

7

Commandments was part of the cost of picking up the phone.

They're pretty easily separable.

It's the communication

Then he says, but they wouldn't have the

10
11

incentive to do it, to do this cross - subsidy on

12

communication, unless they're allowed to go into

13

programming, and then he stops, and that's the part I

14

didn't understand.

15

the incentive?

That is, why?

Why?

What do you mean,

Why is there -- if you could make extra money by

16

17

doing the cross-subsidizing of the two kinds of

18

communication, why wouldn't you do it, irrespective of

19

whether you're in programming?

MR. WALLACE:

21

What does programming add

They're not prohibited from being

22

in programming in the sense of making a movie or a series

undertaking through investment or activities in places

where these things are made to make them for marketing to

others.

QUESTION:

Well, let's call it program editing.

2

MR. WALLACE:

It's marketing programs the way a

3

cable television company does that is the prohibition,

4

putting together a package of programs mostly prepared by

5

others, and marketing them directly to their -- the

6

customers in their own service area that is the

7

prohibition, and that is where the big profit is to be

8

made in comparison with what they would get from enabling
others to use their wires to transport and market their

10

packages of programming.
QUESTION:

11

How can that be cross-subsidized?

12

Can you tell me that, Mr. Wallace?

13

the cross-subsidy that might occur.

MR. WALLACE:

QUESTION:

There would be many common costs

MR. WALLACE:

All of this would have to be

allocated.
QUESTION:

7
8

Mr. Wallace, but I think you --

And this doesn't happen with the

cable companies, who are also rate-regulated?
MR. WALLACE:

9

Well, but they are rate-regulated

10

under Federal law now, but they don't have the problem of

11

extending a regulated monopoly into an area that is less

12

regulated --

QUESTION:

Into programming?

MR. WALLACE:

15

QUESTION:

-- and having to allocate --

Into programming?

Hasn't the

16

Government not only not prohibited them from originating

17

programming, but required them to originate programming?

18

Is there no risk of cross-subsidy there, and was the

19

Government totally unconcerned with that?
MR. WALLACE:

20

Well, there may be some risk of

21

cross-subsidization there, but the Government doesn't have

22

to address every risk throughout the spectrum of society

23

in order to be able to move one step at a time against

24

risks --

let's say $50, just like district cable, okay?

can in fact really charge an additional $5 on my telephone

Now, if it

the cablevision part isn't really necessary for the

11

telephone part, but you fool them, so they could get $50

12

from me for the cable,and they push $5 on my telephone

13

bill.

14

My question is, if they're so smart and can do

15

that and fool everybody, why don't they do it, and if, in

16

fact, they do do it, what is being in the programming

editing part got to do with it?

1

expenses of a substantial nature, they have more

2

opportunity to shift the cost.

3

QUESTION:

You mean, they're going to hide Cecil

4

B. DeMille's Ten Commandments, which is their editing

5

thing, and the regulators are so stupid that they're going

6

to think that that programming business which has no

7

common cost is really part of your telephone service?

8

That would be pretty stupid regulating.

9
10

MR. WALLACE:

Well,

I'm not talking about

producing the Cecil B. DeMille film.

11

QUESTION:

The editing.

12

MR. WALLACE:

The --

I'm talking about marketing

3

something to their same customers over their telephone

4

wires the way the cable television market did to their

5

customers, and what I'm saying is --

6

QUESTION:

So it's a common cost.

7

MR. WALLACE:

-- why they don't do it without

8

having undertaken that, why they don't hide the same $5,

9

as you put it, of expenses is because they don't have the

20
21

expenses to hide.
QUESTION:

So then you're making a common cost

22

argument, and the problem with your common cost argument

23

is all the affidavits in this, I think, even Professor

24

Owen I think in the reply, concedes that Kahn is right

25

that there aren't common costs.

MR. WALLACE:

1

Well, I've mentioned a number of

2

categories of common costs that would be difficult to

3

allocate, and our case doesn't rest entirely on cross­

4

subsidization.

5

discriminatory self preference in handling the facilities

being used for their own benefit as well as for the

7

benefit of others who are competing with them.
QUESTION:

8

9

There is also the problem of

So that's an argument that basically

says we, Congress, would prefer to have a monopolist, the

10

cable company, exist today because then maybe, if the

11

telephone company runs another line into your house, it

12

will let three or four people use that line, but if, in

13

fact, we don't have this statute, what it will do is only

14

one person so will use the line, namely the phone company

15

itself.

MR. WALLACE:

Yes.

QUESTION:

MR. WALLACE:

7

I didn't find anywhere in the record
I could understand this

Well, it's developed through the

history of commission regulation.
QUESTION:

8

Where -- is there somewhere in the

record where they're making it?
MR. WALLACE:

10

I can't point to anything in the

11

record in this case, but we have a long record of

12

commission consideration of these matters, and the

13

commission has, once the cable companies began to get

14

established, they began to look to their wires as the best

15

potential competitors to provide competing local telephone

16

service.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, it would help me if you

18

would clarify what the Government is defending now as

consistent with the First Amendment.

20

history very effectively, but I take it that the

21

Government is no longer defending as consistent with the

principle thing that the statute did, or are you defending

that?

QUESTION:

MR. WALLACE:

2

The commission has interpreted

3

this, and we think very defensibly in its recent report

4

and order, to say that they can define what circumstances

5

will warrant a waiver and still require the particular

6

applicant to show that that applicant meets those

7

circumstances.
QUESTION:

8

9

Do you have another instance where a

waiver provision in a statute is interpreted to mean,

10

going in you have a waiver if you meet these requirements,

11

instead of, here's my particular situation, I would like

12

a waiver because of something peculiar to my situation?

13

MR. WALLACE:

Well, I can't say that one occurs

14

to me off-hand, but it doesn't seem to me to be unique in

15

administrative practice to define in advance what showing

16

will entitle people to a waiver under a public interest

17

standard of a provision that otherwise would apply, and

18

those who do not meet those circumstance will not get a

19

waiver.

20

They -QUESTION:

It seems to me, Mr. Wallace, that in

21

the First Amendment area, where I think this case is

22

taking us, a standard list, or very amorphous waiver

23

scheme, is quite inconsistent with our precedents.

24
25

I'm thinking of the police commissioner that has
this open-ended discretion to allow you to parade or not,

1

and it seems to me that in a sense your waiver argument

2

almost makes your case weaker from a First Amendment

3

standpoint.

4

MR. WALLACE:

I recognize there is First

5

Amendment jurisprudence which says that those seeking to

6

engage in expressive activity should not be subjected to

7

standardless waivers.

8

9

In this case, the waiver is to be based on the
taking account of the purposes of the presumptive bar

10

itself, and those purposes were stated quite clearly in

11

the original House report as to prevent the development of

12

local media monopolies, and to encourage a diversity of

13

ownership of communications outlets.

14

Those are legitimate purposes adverted to and --

15

with approval in this Court's opinion in the Turner

IS

Broadcasting case, not purposes that are in any way meant

17

to suppress speech.

QUESTION:

And that is the thrust and the

19

purport of the Third Report and Order?

21

MR. WALLACE:

Does it

Yes, that because of both

22

technological changes and changes in the nature of the

23

industry, where the cable companies have developed from a

24

fledgling industry to one well-established, competition

25

can now be made a reality in this industry by -- and the

2

running 200 channels and can easily be doubled that and

3

more provides opportunities to introduce several

4

competitors.
And part -- while there was reluctance in the

5
6

initial work of the commission on dial tone to permit the

7

telephone companies to go beyond being carriers for

8

programming for others, they've recognized in this report

9

and order that both in order to preserve the

10

constitutionality of the statute and to give the companies

11

an incentive to make the heavy investment that you need to

12

make dial tone, video dial tone a reality, that they

13

should be allowed to participate, but not to the exclusion

14

of other participants.

15

QUESTION:

Well, does it boil down to this,

16

Mr. Wallace, that in areas in nonrural areas where there

17

is present cable competition, we can assume, you're

18

suggesting to us, that the commission in fact will allow

19

the phone companies into the business.

MR. WALLACE:

2

Well, that's not the only bite, or

even the most important bite of the statute, because cable

is well-established in most --

QUESTION:

6

MR. WALLACE:

What's the important bite?
-- in most parts of the country.

7

The important bites are that they cannot acquire an

8

existing cable company.

9

10
11

They're only allowed to

and - QUESTION:

But if the bite is going to be the

12

justification, you're going to have a statute

13

extraordinarily broader than anything necessary to

14

accomplish that particular justification.

15

MR. WALLACE:

Well, that's only -- and the rest

16

of the bite is that they have to comply with the

17

regulations that the commission is to adopt to safeguard

18

against cross-subsidization and discriminatory self­

19

preference and use of the video dial tone system itself.

20

MR. WALLACE:

The waiver allowing entry is a

10

judgment made.

11

regulators and/or by Congress, or the commission acting

12

pursuant to congressional authority, of how much risk is

13

to be accepted in order to accomplish offsetting public

14

benefits.

15

It's a trade-off judgment often made by

Obviously, there would be less risk of cross­

16

subsidization, virtually no risk if they weren't allowed

17

to participate, or a much lessened risk at the very least,

18

but a judgment has to be made by someone as an industry

19

evolves of when it is that the risk that remains is going

20

to be outweighed by offsetting public benefits.

21

traditionally has not been the role of the courts in our

If that premise is accepted, do you think the

MR. WALLACE:

Yes.

It could happen, and perhaps

6

we were approaching that, and under the stimulus of the

7

litigation that has been brought, the commission has now

MR. WALLACE:

MR. TRIBE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

I think I might begin, as Justice Thomas did, by

pointing out that the Third Report and Order in 1995

Yes, it is, Justice O'Connor.

MR. TRIBE:

Well, I think as in Baker v. Carr

16

there are a few things that with changes can suddenly

17

become wholly irrational, as this one did, but I think

18

even if you try to turn the clock back to 1984, this law

19

would have completely failed to fit the alleged objective,

so I don't think you need to reach the moving target

Well,

first of all,

important thing, Justice Breyer,

something is simply economic regulation,

I think the most

is to ask whether
an argument that

10

the Government made below but has abandoned, or whether

11

this really has a significant enough impact on speech that

12

it is a First Amendment problem in a genuine sense.

13

In this case we're way beyond that.

We're way

14

beyond that along at least two dimensions, because this

about where we're all headed, to keep our eyes gazed on

rather fixed stars of this constitutional constellation.

21

One of them, surely -- and this Court, I guess

22

your concurring opinion in Simon & Schuster made it clear,

Buckley v. Valeo was like that.

Mr. Tribe, this raises a question

5

that has been troubling me.

Supposes that Congress

6

recognized the problem you describe but they still thought

7

the concerns that motivated the statute are still valid,

8

which they may or may not be, and they enacted a statute

9

based on a parallel to the banking regulation, and they

10

said, we don't want the telephone companies to take undue

11

risks with their capital and so forth, and so they

12

basically said telephone companies cannot engage in any

13

business except what they do now, period.
MR. TRIBE:

14

Right.

I think the State, as part

15

of its franchising authority, might have the power to say

16

you, a corporation, are a creature of the State, this is a

17

condition.

18

But even though Mr. Wallace spoke about the

19

telephone companies as though somehow they're all

franchised, and he almost made it sound as though they're

21

all franchised by the national Government so it could

22

impose this condition, it's important --

I suppose given the reach -- I don't

know how far Lopez will end up going, but this sounds like

can't go out and become a speaker or an editor --

QUESTION:

It would have precisely the same

MR. TRIBE:

I don't really think so.

I don't

10

think so, Justice Stevens, because I think political

11

incentives would be very different.

12

for Congress to pass a law that'does not really make a

general structural proposition but says there's a certain

function, namely editing speech, that some speakers cannot

perform.

we want you to disclose fully, and could the answer be,

well, the disclosure is related to our speech, so we're

not subject to --

4

MR. TRIBE:

Oh, I doubt that, Justice Ginsburg.

I mean, I think disclosure requirements have been upheld

in the campaign area, which is a core speech area, and in

the Riley case, even though I think -- Riley v. National

8

Scalia had a problem with some of the disclosure rules,

those were upheld.
All kinds of rules designed to protect the

public from abuses, trying to shift costs to fool

regulators, not aimed at speech, and they're content-

neutral, and they don't demonstrably restrict the amount

to intermediate O'Brien scrutiny, and if it's part of a

law of general applicability, as opposed to a restriction

QUESTION:

Well, but the problem is, when we're

regulation begins, it seems to me that the Congress at

Well, I think as you said in the

Turner opinion, Justice Kennedy, the fact that the

not made that argument.

What does trigger strict scrutiny here, and I do

want to underscore that this law failed any level of

20

scrutiny, including intermediate, and I hope to get back

21

to it, but since you're talking about the future of the

22

First Amendment, I think an important principle to

establish would be that just calling a law economic

actually says.

QUESTION:

Justice Souter, I think it would be

salutary in terms of the First Amendment purposes to

abridge speech.

10

It may not use speech categories, content

categories, as shorthand for other things.

11

Even if the only level of scrutiny were

12

intermediate, as in Turner, the mere existence of

13

elaborate findings, which certainly the 1992 act contained

14

and this act does not, didn't suddenly mean that the fire

15

power of the First Amendment receded.

16

This Court looked closely at, and instructed the

I think it would at that point not be subject to

plain here, that they are foreclosing an important medium

of communication -- maybe not the same one as in Ladue,

MR. TRIBE:

1

Well, I suppose, Justice O'Connor,

2

it depends on what one means by content-neutral.

That is,

3

one could have said that the line in Discovery Network

4

between newspapers and commercial pamphlets is not an

5

ideological line, and so it's content-neutral, but the

6

Court said no, you have to examine the content to tell

7

whether the law applies.

So that's one test.

I think when you suggested in Ladue how

8

9

important it is to have a bright line test for what is and

10

what isn't content-neutral, I think one bright line test I

11

could suggest is, if you can't tell whether the speech is

12

prohibited without subjectively evaluating its content,

13

then it's not content-neutral.

14

QUESTION:

Let me just interrupt for a second.

15

You mean you have to subjectively evaluate a transmission

16

to determine whether it's video programming?

17

MR. TRIBE:

Absolutely.

The FCC has said we

18

have to look at the mix of textual and nontextual

19

material.

20

that makes it a little different from what was around in

21

But you're saying that if you did

or whatever you do, to define the kind of picture that you

be all right.

12

MR. TRIBE:

Well, it would depend on what law it

13

was part of, and -- but that would not -- that would

14

certainly prevent it from being content-based.

15
16
17

This law, I think, fairly speaking, is contentbased, but in any event it is a direct ban on speech.
QUESTION:

Isn't the purpose of the content-

18

based requirement, or a higher hurdle, that we don't want

19

the Government to be imposing its biases against certain

20

contents, against certain subject matters, upon the

21

citizenry, but where the content-based nature is really

based upon reference to a third party, like the Government

MR. TRIBE:

Yes, okay.
I think that would be content-based.

I think the reason is that --

QUESTION:

Well, --no, no.

If you mentioned

Monet, yes, but anything -- Monet's still alive, or it's

Picasso and he's still in one of his earlier periods, so

you don't know what he's going to turn out to be like.

Picasso.

MR. TRIBE:

Well, that's why we have -Is that content-based?
We have -- I think the real answer

probably is intellectual property and copyright.

there is in that context a competing constitutional

provision.

There are circumstances in which people can be

Congress made a bet initially, we may have monopolists

obviously flunks intermediate scrutiny.

you assume for a moment that you could come up with some

answer to your question about how it is that they have

more incentive to cross-subsidize as a result of this law,

the on-balance judgment made by all of the expert agencies

in the Government from 1987 to 1992 and then embodied in

That is, even if

1

counterproductive in terms of the competitive objective.
I mean, the conclusion, I think, that was in

3

your 1987 article tentatively, they adopted it and went

4

full fire with it.

5

They said that it's virtually hallucinatory to

6

think that the telephone companies could enter this market

7

with massive cable incumbents, win market power through

8

this scheme of predatory pricing, and knock out those huge

9

companies, and that on balance the law, even if you grant

10

that regulators are so stupid that they would miss

11

everything, that on balance the law is responsible for

12

this massive monopoly we now have, as Justice Scalia

13

suggested, that the law, in fact, costs consumers billions

14

of dollars in competitive benefits.

15

Now, if you wanted to look at the big picture,

16

one thing you surely want to say is that the Government is

17

not entitled to say that, because speech is important and

18

speech-related industries are important, we are entitled

19

to have a law sustained that on the undisputed record in

20

this case eliminates something like 99 percent of the

21

speech that telephone companies could provide in video

22

programming form, allowed to have it sustained on the

23

basis of wild speculations, where all of the evidence,

the model intermediate scrutiny cases often have involved

direct restraints on speech, as such Heffron v. Krishna

intermediate scrutiny.
