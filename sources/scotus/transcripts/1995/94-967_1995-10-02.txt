JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Seufert, you may proceed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. SEUFERT

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SEUFERT:

10

Justice Stevens, may it please the

Court:
The common law of fraud:

Justice Easterbrook in

11

his opinion in the matter of Mayer stated, an intentional

12

deceit concerning a material proposition is fraud whether

13

or not a more alert target would have smelled a rat, as

14

victims of intentional torts need not take special

15

precautions.

16

Under the common law as laid out in the

17

Restatement of Torts section 545(a), a plaintiff's

18

reliance on an intentional fraud must only be justifiable.

19

His conduct does not have to conform to that of a

20

reasonable man, because fraud is an intentional tort.

21

victim of such is not required to exercise the care of a

22

reasonable man, just that of a reasonable victim.

23

QUESTION:

The

At common law, must the reliance be

24

justifiable, however, for fraud?

25

MR. SEUFERT:

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

Justifiable does not equate with reasonable, and the

2

common law spells out the difference between the two.
QUESTION:

3
4

Do you think there is a requirement

of justifiability at least?
MR. SEUFERT:

5

There has to be a requirement of

6

materiality, because the elements of false pretenses,

7

false representations, or actual fraud, are not laid out

8

in 523(a)(2)(A).

Yes.

Mm-hmm.
Because fraud is an intentional

crime.

18

QUESTION:

And possibly justifiability.

19

MR. SEUFERT:

Correct, and the reason that is so

20

is that a balancing act is done in the common law between

21

the culpability of a defendant versus the culpability of

22

his victim.

23

QUESTION:

Do we know what the difference is

24

between, what are the three categories, false pretenses,

25

false representation, and actual fraud?

You still can't win, because there's

This Court --

QUESTION:

What about reliance?

Does the

8

reliance have to be justifiable with respect to the false

9

pretence and the false representation claim at common law?
MR. SEUFERT:

10

The reliance must be justifiable

11

if it's an intentional fraud, because there's -- there's

12

fraud --

13
14

QUESTION:

Well, each of these -- you have just

described each of these as intentional, haven't you?

15

MR. SEUFERT:

16

QUESTION:

That's correct.

So you are saying that at common law

17

there must be a justifiable reliance in each of the three

18

categories, not just fraud, but the representation and

19

pretense.
MR. SEUFERT:

20

And the reason it must be

21

justifiable is because there has to be some materiality

22

under the common law between the fraud and the loss of the

23

victim.

I must say, I'm interested to hear

this difference among the three described so clearly in

What that case concerns is that the fraud must

But fraud is always an intentional

I thought you conceded that.
MR. SEUFERT:

Justice, there can be fraud

10

implied by law.

New Hampshire and many other States have

11

a fraudulent conveyances act, which means that if you sell

12

property or give away property for less than fair value

13

when you are about to be sued, or about to incur debts,

14

that the State law considers that's a fraudulent

15

conveyance, even though you had no intent to be

16

fraudulent, you were making a gift.

Dischargeable, right?
MR. SEUFERT:

While that is not the facts of

3

this case, I would agree with you, it would be

4

dischargeable.

5

QUESTION:

Well then, can you explain to me the

6

consistency between saying that if the debtor does

7

something to alert the creditor, then the debt will not be

8

discharged, but if he says nothing at all, then it's going
to be discharged?

So if he does something that's helpful

10

to the creditor at least in raising a red flag, some kind

11

of alert that something's going on in the mind of the

12

debtor, that maybe he's going to transfer this property,

13

then it's not dischargeable, but if he just goes ahead and

14

does it, it is.

15

What sense does that make?

MR. SEUFERT:

If I can maybe explain, if the

16

property would have had to have been transferred without

17

any notification or any back and forth correspondence,

18

that would be fraud under the Fraudulent Conveyances Act

in the State of New Hampshire.

QUESTION:

some other means, perhaps, that the transfer -QUESTION:

2

But don't you think that there's a

3

certain anomaly between the debtor being really bad and

not saying one word and just doing it, and the debtor

saying -- giving some tipoff to the creditor?

6

the one be dischargeable, that is, where -- the worst

7

conduct that we can attribute to the debtor, saying

8

nothing, lead to a dischargeable debt, and if the

9

creditor, the debtor has said something, then it's not

10

dischargeable?
MR. SEUFERT:

11

12

Why should

It may not have been a tipoff,

Justice, if I may explain.

13

The letters -- if you want to get into a

14

particular fact, the letter that went out to my client

15

says, we know about the due-on-sale, and we do not want to

16

trigger it, therefore we want your consent, making a

17

representation that they knew and wouldn't violate that

18

section, and subsequently they did violate that section

19

when they sent that letter out, and the trial court said

20

that was fraud.

21

fraud.

22

That was false pretenses, so that was

If the letter -- if the letter had not gone out

23

and there was no representation, well, I know about it and

24

I don't want to violate it, we'd have a tougher -- tougher

25

case here before this Court.

Those aren't the facts, though, because we have

the actual fraud taking place at the time, and there was a

finding of the fraud.
But the trial court turned on that we needed

reasonable reliance.

An

If we're using this

11

balancing act and we're looking at negligent

12

representation under the law versus intentional

13

representation, because the law does this balancing act,

14

and if there's intent, scienter, bad intent, evil intent

15

on behalf of the perpetrator, then the law protects the

victim by saying, okay, you don't have to prove the

reasonableness, you just have to prove that you, in good

faith, did rely --

QUESTION:

that under fraud you have to show the reliance was

justifiable?

MR. SEUFERT:

QUESTION:

Yes.

That's the word they use, and I never

24

heard in this whole case, anywhere, anybody until now,

making a distinction between reasonable and justifiable.

interpret them in ways that aren't that technical, and as

17

I read through these briefs, I thought the issue in this

case is whether there is a requirement in section (a) that

19

the person who is the victim have to have behaved

20

reasonably or justifiably in the circumstance.

21

I didn't think there was that big a difference

22

between the two, and although Judge Cyr -- I think it was

Judge Cyr, is that right? -- said -- well, said reasonable

25

result if he used the word justifiable and unjustifiable.

Now, for the first time I'm hearing something

different, and it probably is my fault, not focusing on

it, but I'd like to get you to focus on that and why it

4

makes a difference.
MR. SEUFERT:

5

In our brief, Your Honor, we

6

pointed out that contributory negligence is not a defense

7

when you have an intentional tort.
When Congress wrote the two sections

8

9

523(a)(2)(A) and (a)(2)(B), you can see a clear

10

distinction that Congress made by including in

11

523(a)(2)(B) that even if the victim proves reasonable

12

reliance, he also must prove intent to deceive.

13

prove those two elements, the intent and reasonable.

14

is a departure from the common law, which says if you

15

prove the evil intent, you don't have to prove reasonable

reliance.

reliance standard, is that fair to say?

MR. SEUFERT:

That's correct, Your Honor.

We

did put the example in our brief regarding the, if you say

10

you own the property and you're going to give me a

11

mortgage, I'm going to give you a mortgage and you own the

12

property outright, there's no mortgage -- or if there is a

mortgage -- I could have checked on it by going right next

1

Justice Breyer is very lively, but once you get out of

2

such an obvious example, then your distinction between the

3

duty to investigate and no duty to investigate would --

4

could make a crucial difference and I suppose you -- of

5

course you would argue that it does here.

6

MR. SEUFERT:

Well, there is no duty to

7

investigate if you prove evil intent, the evil empire, on

8

the perpetrator of the fraud.

9

QUESTION:

Well, we're talking about evil.

I'd

10

like you to tell me why this obligation was obtained by

11

fraud, because your answer to the question, if he has the

12

debt, the creditor-debtor relationship is established, the

13

debtor says nothing and just sells the property --

14

dischargeable.

15

The debtor says something, but still he obtained

16

the credit originally long before there was any

17

representation, so why does this fit within obtained-by

18

fraud, the obtained-by language?

19

MR. SEUFERT:

The extension of credit is what we

20

relied upon before the trial court, because there is a --

MR. SEUFERT:

QUESTION:

The due-on-sale clause would have kicked in

That's right.

You have two situations where the

7

creditor didn't know about it, and everything remained the

8

same.

9

There was no new activity, there was no formal

10

extension of the debt, there was just a debt obtained

11

originally without regard to any fraud, and then a

12

continuation of that same debt with no renewal, so I don't

13

understand why we would say this debt was obtained by the

14

fraud where if the debtor had said nothing it would not

15

have been obtained by the fraud.

2

MR. JENKINS:

I think that's correct.

3

In fact, we disagree with petitioners that the

common law elements of fraud, whatever they may be, are

5

controlling in this case.

6

Federal statutory construction, in particular the

language, the structure, and the history of the Bankruptcy

Code, are better tools for discerning Congress' intent in

9

this case.
QUESTION:

10

We think the ordinary rules of

Well, might we look to the common law

11

definition for the meaning of the terms that Congress

12

used?

13

MR. JENKINS:

I think that's possible, Your

14

Honor, but I think the better source is, again, the

15

structure of the code, and in particular the word, fraud,

16

which is used elsewhere in the bankruptcy Code, is used in

17

other Federal statutes which this Court in Grogan v.

18

Garner indicated are better sources for discerning

19

Congress' intent when it used the term fraud.

20

For example, in the False Claims Act, a Federal

21

fraud statute, reasonable reliance is not required.

22

the securities laws, reasonable reliance is sometimes

23

required, but in particular situations such as failure to

24

disclose, or a fraud on the market theory, reasonable

25

reliance is not required, and so we think that the element

of reasonable reliance that was required in this case is

2

not inextricably bound with the term fraud as Congress

3

likely intended it.

4

QUESTION:

But isn't the difference here that

5

the word fraud occurs in a series, and the other two terms

6

in the series are obviously common law terms?

7

MR. JENKINS:

Well, I think, Your Honor, it's

8

unclear whether false representations and false pretenses

9

are common law terms or whether they in fact are statutory

10

terms.

11

that in --

12

Fraud certainly is a common law term, but we think

QUESTION:

Yes, but there's no definition of

13

them anywhere in the statute, which is a pretty good

14

indication that there is a reference to some place else,

15

and the some place else is State common law, isn't it?

16

MR. JENKINS:

17

that's not the best explanation.

Well, that may be, but we think

18

In 1978, when Congress created the Bankruptcy

19

Code, revised the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, it introduced

20

the term, actual fraud, and looked to this Court's

21

decision in Neal v. Clark, and that decision indicated

22

that the term fraud means scienter, and that was the

23

purpose that Congress had in mind when it introduced the

24

fraud language.

It is in the legislative history,

and it's cited in our brief, I believe footnote 5.

QUESTION:

6

MR. JENKINS:

As I've said, we think that the

7

better tool of statutory construction here is the

8

structure of the Bankruptcy Code.

9

exempts from discharge two independent categories of

Section 523(a)(2)

10

fraudulently incurred debts.

Paragraph (B) is limited to

11

false statements of financial condition, expressly

12

includes reasonable reliance as one of its elements.

13

Paragraph (A) exempts all other fraudulently incurred

14

debts and contains no such requirements.
In our view, the juxtaposition of those two

15
16

provisions requires the conclusion that reasonable

17

reliance is necessary -- must be proved only in the

18

narrower category of false financial statement cases.

19

We think Congress would have had no reason to

20

create two independent provisions, paragraphs (A) and (B),

21

if, as the respondent argues, it had intended for the

22

elements of those provisions to be identical.

23

could instead have simply created -- introduced a single

reasonable reliance requirement in a unified section

QUESTION:

No, why in the one and not the other?

7

MR. JENKINS:

Well, because there was a pattern

8

of abuse by consumer finance companies that Congress

9

identified as to (B), and that was the purpose for

10

expressly including the elements of (B), materiality being

11

one, reasonable reliance being another, that that would

provide added protection to debtors in that category, but

reasonable reliance, whereas what was then (B), the second

12

part of old 17(a)(2), the cases split, and in order to

13

strengthen the (B) part with respect to written financial

14

statements, Congress added the word, reasonableness, to

15

clarify it.

16

12 at pages 12 and 13 makes this very point, I believe.

In fact, the Government's brief in footnote

17

Reading from the line that starts on page 12 and

18

goes to 13, "In any event, Congress clearly concluded that

19

any judicial trend toward a proof of reasonable reliance

20

requirement in financial statement cases was not so well

21

established as to obviate the need for express inclusion

22

of the requirement."

23

I think that shows the congressional intent that

24

they wanted to make what is now (B) just as strong as what

25

now is now (A).

QUESTION:

1

With respect to the pre-'78 common

law cases, how do you account for what seems to be a

3

disparity of standards between the cases that you rely on

4

and the Restatement, because I take it the Restatement, in

5

talking about justifiable reliance, really is talking

6

about a less strict standard?

MR. WHITTINGTON:

15

position was that reasonableness was all that was

or justifiable.

The explanation given by the Ninth Circuit was

that justifiable includes reasonableness plus other

23

various potential factors in the mix, they could include

24

whether the lender is alerted by some fact, as in our

situation, and/or whether the creditor had a duty to

MR. WHITTINGTON:

9

That's correct, and that's the

10

point of the Mayer case, I believe.

The Mayer case says,

11

in the first instance, there's no duty to nose out the

truth.

14

information.

And so in our view it doesn't matter if the

Either way, it

24

I might add that the Ninth Circuit also points

law elements of fraud uses justifiable, which they take

out of Prosser in the Second Restatement, which is one of

the reasons that the majority opinion in Kirsh looks to

the reason that Congress took the trouble to list out the

two ways: writing, and financial statements.

22

Other than those two factors, they exactly track

23

the common law, in our view, which is why there was no

24

need to list out the elements in 523(a)(2)(A).

they could simply give us legal shorthand, if you were, a

jurisprudence connotes all those subsidiary elements in

it.

4

QUESTION:

Do you agree that (B), the test of

5

satisfying (B) is less strict than the test of satisfying

6

(A), or do I have it backwards?

7

MR. WHITTINGTON:

No.

I think that they're

8

equally strict, and in the '70 to '78 case period under

9

the prior law, there was some disagreement as to that.
That is, some courts were construing (B) as

10
11

being less strict, and Congress was concerned about that,

12

so to clarify that, that they didn't want (B) less strict,

13

they threw in the word reasonableness to clarify it, so

14

our position is that (A) and (B) are both equally strict

15

with respect to reliance.

16

QUESTION:

Do you agree, though, that (B) was

17

specifically directed at finance companies that relied on

18

written statements that they should not reasonably have

19

relied on?

20
21
22

MR. WHITTINGTON:

I think the tightening up of

the statute was specifically directed at that.
In fact, Judge Berry gave testimony to the House

23

subcommittee that considered this, in which he delivered

24

to them a decision in a case where there was no

25

reasonableness, and he had ruled that therefore there was

1

no fraud, and his view was that that was not appropriate.

2

And then in the language that's been quoted by

3

both the petitioners and the Solicitor General, Congress

4

in both the Senate and the House reports states that it's

5

concerned about finance companies who might even encourage

6

lenders to leave something out.

7

them was the actual forms that didn't even leave enough

8

room to put the information on there, which was one of the

9

abuses that Congress was concerned about.

No, I don't think so either,

20

because there's a discharge as of the date -- the debtor

22

guessing, so I think the answer is no again.

23

Finally, as to the plain language, and why I

24

believe that (A) is simply a laundry list, legal

shorthand, is the fact that several justices have pointed

turns entirely on whether we think reasonable reliance is
the same as justifiable reliance.
MR. WHITTINGTON:

I don't agree with Your Honor.

12

I think that Mr. Mans should win in either event, because

13

whether the term reasonable is used, or justifiable, on

14

the facts of this case it wasn't possible for Field to be

15

either one.

16

In fact, the Court will recall that in this case

17

Mr. Field had actual knowledge that a Mr. DeFelice was on

18

the property claiming to be the owner, and that was the

19

alleged implicitness representation.

20

the bankruptcy court, was that Mr. Mans had implied that

21

he hadn't transferred it, and our view is, whether you

22

use -- whether the Court would use reasonable or

23

justifiable, it's neither one for Mr. Field to simply do

24

nothing, not even ask Mr. Mans when he sees him on

25

QUESTION:

But you allege there was one, but do

11

you -- you don't also agree it was necessary that there be

12

a duty to investigate.

13

MR. WHITTINGTON:

No.

I think that once he

14

became aware of facts which called into question the

15

representation, then a duty arose.

16

Now, I'm engaging right now in factual

17

determinations, which is not the appropriate thing for us

18

to be doing at this Court, but that's the thought process

19

that the trier of fact, the bankruptcy judge in this case,

20

should be undertaking.

QUESTION:

We're talking as though the duty to

investigate and the unreasonableness of the reliance are

two separate things.

aren't they?

MR. WHITTINGTON:

Our view is, those are all

factors in the mix to be considered by the bankruptcy

court, and as an advocate at the trial court level, those

6

are the facts that I'm playing with.

7

that I'm trying to establish, that the creditor was on

8

notice, that the creditor maybe was sophisticated, that

Those are the facts

the creditor maybe is required by Federal law to do
10

certain investigations and has failed to do that if it's a

11

bank, that the creditor had a special relationship with

12

the debtor that would cause him to normally undertake an

13

investigation -- as an advocate at the trial court level,

14

those are all factors in the mix which I would be trying

15

to urge on the factfinder.

16

But the question before the Court, in our

17

judgment, is, should the factfinder be engaging in that

analysis, and to that answer -- to that question, the

answer has to be yes, in our view.

point if the credit wasn't obtained by the fraud.
MR. WHITTINGTON:

2

I welcome that question.

This

3

was an issue that absolutely slipped through, perhaps

4

because Mr. Mans was unrepresented below, but under the

5

clear language of the statute, there has to be an

QUESTION:

Thank you.

21

MR. WHITTINGTON:

Next, I would like to address

22

the collateral estoppel issue, which hasn't been spoken

23

about here today.

24

v. Garner case that collateral estoppel principles are

25

important, particularly in section 523(a)(2)(A) cases.

This Court stated in 1991 in the Grogan

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.
SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

In

1

Grogan, of course, you decided that the appropriate

2

standard of proof was preponderance as opposed to clear

3

and convincing, and the reason that the Court gave that --

4

decided that was so that collateral estoppel principles

5

would be furthered between State or Federal court actions

6

and the bankruptcy court actions.

7

Under the same analysis, in order for collateral

8

estoppel to work, there needs to be the same grouping of

9

factors in the two types of cases, and in fact there are

10

situations where a case may go to trial first in the State

11

court, let's say, on a common law fraud action, by which

12

it's determined --by which the debtor prevails, let's

13

say, because there was no reasonable reliance, and then

14

some months later, after there's a filing in bankruptcy,

15

there is an inconsistent ruling in the bankruptcy court,

16

or it could be the other way around, if the bankruptcy

17

ruling under 523(a)(2)(A) could be determined first, and

18

there be an inconsistent result the other direction later

19

in State or Federal court.

20

Finally, I'd like to address a subject that was

21

mentioned, I believe by Justice Scalia, which is the role

22

that the reliance element really plays, and I think the

23

answer to that question is that it is the principal tool

24

of the factfinder in determining whether there's actual

25

causation, a link between the misrepresentation on the one

side and the action taken by the creditor on the other.
That language is expressly picked up by the

3

Kirsh case, quoting Prosser, and that's the reason that

4

it's important for this Court, in our judgment, to

5

maintain the reliance requirement so that in fact judicial

factfinders have this important tool to determine that in

fact there is a causal link, which is a real one.
