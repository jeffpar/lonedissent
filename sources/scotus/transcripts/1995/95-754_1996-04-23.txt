ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR R. MILLER

8

ON BEHALF OF MEDTRONIC, INC.
MR. MILLER:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case brings before you the question of

11
12

defining the scope of the express preemption provision in

13

the Medical Device Amendments of 1976.

14

Medical devices are a heavily regulated

15

industry.

16

Congress enacted these Medical Device Amendments and

17

brought them under the jurisdiction of the FDA and made it

18

perfectly clear that it was designing a scheme by which

19

the FDA had basic and complete jurisdiction to deal with

20

medical devices.

21

that this preemption provision which is before you this

22

morning acted as a general prohibition on non-Federal

23

regulation.

24
25

That has been true since 1976, when the

Indeed, the legislative history said

The provision, which is set out on page 4 of the
initial brief, is very, very broad one, almost uniquely

1

broad.

2

it basically says that any Federal requirement under the

3

Medical Device Amendments preempts any State requirement

4

which is different from or in addition to the Federal

5

requirement, and which relates to the safety or

6

effectiveness of the device or to any other matter

7

included as a requirement applicable to the device.

8

9

Reduced to what we think are its simplest terms,

QUESTION:

Mr. Miller, is there evidence that

you have found that Congress thought it was eliminating

10

all State common law claims and would the action of

11

Congress just last year in proposing, at least, caps on

12

punitive damages but not compensatory damages relating to

13

these devices indicate that at a least Congress thought

14

some claims were preserved?

15

MR. MILLER:

In all honesty, Justice O'Connor,

16

there really is almost nothing in the legislative history.

17

One can divine from the scope of this provision,

18

its words, its very words, where it uses any requirement,

19

a word that is like all which this court has construed in

20

Norfolk and Western as being very, very broad.

21

The language of this provision, coupled with the

22

legislative purpose of establishing a unitary, uniform,

23

national regulatory authority under the guidance of

24

statutorily mandated expert advisory committees I think

25

can lead only to the conclusion that the intent of

1

Congress, although not expressed as such in the

2

legislative history, is to preclude anything done by a

3

State within the ambit of a Federal requirement - -

4

QUESTION:

But the term requirement is by no

5

means self-explanatory.

6

evidence that requirement means State common law

7

provisions.

9

MR. MILLER:

I mean, I don't think it's self-

That is true, and we have, on the

issue of requirement, the fact that 10 courts of appeals

10

have looked at that word.

11

has concluded that the word requirement is broad and, for

12

example, embraces common law claims, a major point made by

13

the plaintiffs in this case.

14

requirement in Cipollone, it has construed it in Morales,

15

it has construed it in Easterwood.

16

construed as a word of restriction.

QUESTION:

18

MR. MILLER:

All except the Ninth Circuit

This Court has construed

It has never been
Also --

Mr. Miller --- the statute itself, almost as a

19

leitmotif, continues to use the word requirement not

20

simply in the preemption provision, it uses it in the

21

remedies provision, it uses it in the 510(k) provision, it

22

uses it in the manufacturing design provision --

23

QUESTION:

Well --

QUESTION:

Mr. Miller, your position, as I

25

understand it, is that the preemption provision not only

1

excludes common law actions which seek to impose liability

2

for a mater that is not unlawful under the Federal scheme,

3

but even precludes a State cause of action for a violation

4

of the Federal scheme for an identical requirement.

5

MR. MILLER:

6

QUESTION:

That is our position.
I know it is.

Why, then, would you

7

even write this provision?

8

wouldn't you just say, there shall be no State common --

9

you know, lawsuits involving these issues, period?

10

MR. MILLER:

If that's the case, why

We believe that it was necessary to

11

write the provision in this fashion in order to establish

12

the fact that as a precursor to the preemption you had to

13

have a Federal requirement.

14

Only when you had a Federal requirement, then a

15

State requirement that fell within the subject matter of

16

the Federal requirement would be preempted if it added to

17

or differed from Federal requirements.

18

it's a rational -- maybe not the best, but a rational way

19

of writing it to achieve Congress' goal of establishing

20

primary jurisdiction in the FDA.

21

QUESTION:

It seems to me

What if I bring a lawsuit saying that

22

the device, although it was marketed under, what is it,

23

310(k) as being substantially identical to a preexisting

24

device was, in fact, not, and that the application

claiming that substantial equivalence was intentionally

fraudulent, and therefore for violation of that 310(k)

2

provision I want damages.

3

What additional requirement has that added?

4

What different or additional requirement has the State

5

added when it allows that suit?

6

MR. MILLER:

Two preliminary points, Justice

7

Scalia.

Number 1, there is no such claim in this case.

8

Number 2, several courts of appeals have struggled with

9

questions like that and have agreed unanimously that the

10

preemption provision embraces identical State claims or

11

claims of noncompliance with the FDA requirements or even

12

claims of fraud on the FDA, the most notable being a First

13

Circuit - -

15

QUESTION:

State court against the manufacturers of these devices?
MR. MILLER:

16
17

So there's no possible action in

There could be actions if they do

not fall within the ambit of a Federal requirement.
QUESTION:

18

But so far as the Federal

19

requirement,

the State can't impose its own common law and

20

it can't permit suit on the Federal requirement.

21

an extraordinary sweep.
MR. MILLER:

22

Well, Mr. Chief Justice,

That's

the reason

23

that I think it's a perfectly appropriate conclusion is,

24

number 1,

25

right of action, so the notion --

the act itself provides for no Federal private

Do you think that helps you?

I say,

Federal cause of action.
MR. MILLER:

Not only do you not allow a State cause of

remediless.

The bargain, or - -

QUESTION:

7

That does not leave the situation

Mr. Miller, before you proceed with

8

your answer to that, I'd like to know what is within the

9

coverage.

I understand that you're arguing about these

10

devices that are substantially equivalent.

12

they, too, immune from tort liability if there is a

13

Federal requirement?

MR. MILLER:

Are

Justice Ginsburg, if a matter being

15

asserted in a State-based action falls within a Federal

16

requirement, it seems to us the text of this statute

17

precludes it.

QUESTION:

So your answer is, this covers

19

devices that have not been preapproved -- indeed, the

20

grandparented devices have never been - - gone through the

21

510(k) procedure, never been through any procedure.

22

MR. MILLER:

Let me clarify something.

There is

23

an image that the pre-'76 devices are unregulated.

24

Counsel for the plaintiffs and the Solicitor General have

25

indicated that there's never been a safety and

products.
Two points.

3

If you look at the appendix we have

4

put in the back of our reply brief, you will see that

5

basically every medical device on the marketplace is

6

regulated.

7

devices out there that are unregulated, that are -- to use

8

the pejorative word, that have been grandfathered, or

grandpersoned.

It is simply wrong to assume that there are

MR. MILLER:

That is correct, but if you look at

the language of the preemption provision, it does not say

QUESTION:

It does not turn on approval or - Mr. Miller, can I bring you back to

3

Justice Scalia's question for a moment that you didn't get

4

a chance to answer?

5

Supposing Florida passed a statute and said it

6

shall be unlawful to market any devices that do not comply

7

with the Federal standard, good manufacturing practice,

8

and so forth, and one who distributes such a device shall

9

be liable if it harms anybody, and so there would be no

10

difference between the State requirement and the Federal

11

requirement.

12

Preemption or no preemption?

MR. MILLER:

Preemption, because the scheme of

13

the statute is to allow the FDA through its expert

14

advisory committees and all the talent it brings to bear

15

on these devices --

16

QUESTION:

17

But you can't support that from the

text of the statute.

18

MR. MILLER:

19

QUESTION:

I think you can.

If --

Because my hypothesis is there's no

20

difference between the State requirement and the Federal

21

requirement.

22

MR. MILLER:

One can argue notice that there's

23

much broader preemption if the State matter deals with

24

safety or effectiveness.

That's completely preempted,

1

You're using addition to as simply-

2

meaning a State requirement.

3

that it exists, regardless of its terms, means that it is

4

there is an overlap in those two provisions, there's no

doubt about it.

QUESTION:

2

I'm not arguing the Cipollone point.

3

What I'm saying is, requirement covers any substantive

provision imposed by means of the common law, but how is

the mere availability of a common law lawsuit a

requirement, which is what you're arguing in order to

exclude lawsuits entirely.
MR. MILLER:

Number 1, two of the provisions of

this statute refer to the remedies in this State as

You'll find that at 352t and 331q(l).

QUESTION:

Mr. Miller, the FDA itself appears

22

possibly to have tried to narrow the meaning of

requirement by using the words specific requirement in its

24

regulation, indicating that perhaps the Federal

requirement the statute refers to must be device-specific

as opposed to general requirements of the FDA dealing with

2

manufacturing or labeling that apply across the board to

3

all devices.

4
5
6

Now, how do you deal with that apparent attempt
to narrow the meaning of requirement?
MR. MILLER:

The first level is, there is no

7

modifier on the word, requirement, in the statute.

statute does not say, big requirement, small requirement,

9

specific requirement, or general requirement.

Is it in any way open to

interpretation by the agency, do you think?

12

the statute lays out a series of remedies, and to permit

13

any State or municipality to come along and impose in the

14

name of identity an additional sanction seems to me

15

completely destructive.

16

QUESTION:

It begs the question, though.

I

17

mean, because that's exactly the question, whether an

18

additional sanction is an additional requirement.

19

exactly the point we're arguing, and simply to say it

20

violates the scheme is to beg the question.

21

QUESTION:

That's

And I take it from your answer,

22

Mr. Miller, that you're saying that there is a universe of

23

preemption that is broader than the language itself.

24
25

MR. MILLER:

Oh, there would be a universe of

preemption broader than this.

This is a broad preemption,

but I do not think it is the broadest conceivable.

QUESTION:

So we're not --

QUESTION:

Well, Justice Scalia --

4

QUESTION:

So we're not confined to the language

5

of the statute in determining the scope of preemption?
MR. MILLER:

6

I think you have to interpret these

7

words in light of what Congress was trying to achieve in

8

1976.
QUESTION:

9

Was it in 1976, on the effective date

10

of the act, that all State suits were prohibited as to the

11

pacemaker?

12

State's actions in this case were preempted?

13

What was the chronological point at which the

MR. MILLER:

Presumably they applied only

14

prospectively, not to devices implanted prior to 1976.

15

For example, that is why much of the Daikon Shield

16

litigation never came under this statute at all.

17

preceded the effective date of this statute.

It

But I think Congress did make it clear that the

19

effect of this provision was to be immediate, with the FDA

20

filling in the gaps of regulation, and that's what that

Appendix A is all about.

22

QUESTION:

But before those gaps were filled in,

23

there was still preemption.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN WOLFMAN

ON BEHALF OF LORA LOHR, ET VIR.

6

MR. WOLFMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Listening to the argument, and reading

7

Medtronic's briefs, the most remarkable feature of

8

Medtronic's arguments is what the company does not say.

9

If the company is correct, every case claiming

10

personal injuries caused by a medical device, whether

11

based on defective manufacture, grossly negligent

12

manufacturing practices, or a knowing failure to disclose

3

defects in the product, all were swept away on the day

4

that the law was enacted in

976.

5

To appreciate why the company is wrong, I want

6

to step back for a minute and explain the section 5 0(k)

7

process, the substantial equivalent process, which is the

8

key element of Medtronic's preemption defense, and then

9

move on to some of the other FDA rules which the company

20
21

claims totally immunize it from tort liability.
The 40

pacemaker lead implanted in Lora Lohr

22

was marketed solely on the basis of Medtronic's

23

of substantial equivalence to a device marketed prior to

24

the enactment of the MDA, a device which the FDA never

25

reviewed at all for safety and effectiveness.

The 510(k) process does not establish an device

2

design requirements that could possibly preempt Ms. Lohr's

3

design-defect claim.

require full premarket approval for Class III, like

6

pacemaker leads, Class III 510(k) devices --

Indeed, the FDA itself has

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. WOLFMAN:

Full premarket approval from the FDA?
The States would be free, in that

9

circumstance, because the device was only subject to the

10

510(k) process, that until such time the DA had required

11

the PMA, that the States would be free to require their

12

own PMA's for that device, and there is a reason for that.

MR. WOLFMAN:

Yes.

In the Hillsborough County-

2

case, which is cited at different points in our brief,

3

Hillsborough County gave Chevron-style deference to one,

4

just one sentence in regulatory commentary concerning the

5

issue in that case which was whether States could regulate

6

in the area of plasmapheresis even though the FDA had

7

already done so, and the Court deferred.

8

9

Here, there is even more reason for deference,
Your Honor, because under 360k(B), the exemption from

10

preemption provision, it really is necessary for the FDA

11

to say both what the scope of preemption is and whether

12

there -- an exemption ought to be granted.

22

Justice Scalia, there's more reason to do it here because

23

more instrumentation is necessary.

is a reason for that, Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

2

3

You mean the FDA has ruled, not the

States have ruled.

4

MR. WOLFMAN:

Yes, that's right, the FDA has

5

ruled, and there is a reason for that, Mr. Chief Justice,

6

which is this, that for Class III devices the relevant

7

requirement as to safety and effectiveness is clearly the

8

premarket approval.

9

as devices that ought to go through premarket approval.

The statute defines Class III devices

10

The fact is, that has not happened yet for pacemaker leads

11

because the implementation of the statute has been

12

delayed.

13

Now, there is

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Wolfman, once there has been --

15

once, one fine day when the FDA does have a premarket

16

approval setup of its own, and a device does get that

17

premarket approval, would there will be State tort

18

remedies?

19

MR. WOLFMAN:

Well, I think there would be State

20

tort remedies.

It's clearly a closer question, but there

21

are still going to tort remedies for two reasons.

22

we address in our brief extensively, we do not believe

23

this Congress in 1976 was referring to State damages

24

actions when it was using term requirement, for the many

25

Justice Scalia's question, here all there was is a finding

not obtain a competitive advantage over the subsequent -QUESTION:

MR. WOLFMAN:

I'd be glad to slow down.

you, Your Honor.
The purpose of it was not to gain a competitive

advantage over the manufacturers of devices who came

13

later, and that was the sole purpose of it.

14

To be sure, it is true, as your question

15

indicates, that there has been delays in the

16

implementation of these processes, but that doesn't

17

suggest that there was a design requirement on 510(k)

devices.

19

There is one other regulation that the --

Medtronic relies upon to say that there's some device

requirement here with respect to this substantial

equivalent device, and that is a regulation at 807.81,

that's our point, although many things under the act --

18

for instance, the requirement that manufacturers register

with the agency, they're all requirements, but to make any

20

sense out of the statute you have to at the very least

concede some subject matter congruence between the State

law requirement and the Federal law requirement, and what

we're saying is that to be sure, on the State law side

Let me use a few examples to show that.

Assume

that the plaintiff claimed under State law that a device

failed because it was constructed by untrained personnel.

The most relevant GMP simply states, and it is at

have the necessary training to perform their assigned

Now, getting back to some of the questions posed

by Justice Scalia, it's very clear that her claim would

chose to be much more specific simply by issuing different

MR. WOLFMAN:

Well, again, we say that

11

that is correct, Your Honor, and let me use an example.

For instance, in the area of tampon labeling,

the agency has acted specifically.

we not only want this tampon label but we want three more

QUESTION:

Mr. Wolfman, I -- what I don't

MR. WOLFMAN:

6

Well, that's right, but let me use

7

an example of how that played out in the regulatory

process.

9

For instance, there are labeling requirements

10

that simply say, the applicable ones here say that the

device ought to have a label, should have a label that

lists all warnings, contraindications, and such forth,

those regulations essentially preexisted the MDA, because

they applied both to drugs and devices.

That pre- -- that --

Then the FDA later ruled a couple of years after

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

The United States agrees with the Respondents

for Medtronic, but our position differs somewhat from both

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right, applicable under the act,

Right, law from whatever source.

And to cover the statutory thing you

would have to include or any subdivision.
MR. KNEEDLER:

12

13

Right.

Political subdivision, that's

correct.
Conversely, we do not agree with Medtronic's

15

broad submissions that the mere fact that its pacemaker

17

was found to be substantially equivalent altogether

preempts respondents' State law claims.
The Federal act preempts a State requirement

20

only if it's different from or in addition to a Federal

21

requirement applicable under the act.

22

requirement for Class III, indeed, its defining

exception.

1

In this case, the finding of substantial

2

equivalence as part of the 510(k) process served to exempt

3

the Medtronic lead in this case from the PMA requirement.

4

In other words, the only purpose of the substantial

5

equivalence determination in this case was to render

6

inapplicable to the device under the Food & Drug Act the

7

premarket approval characteristic.

8

9

The substantial equivalence determination is not
itself a requirement under the act for purposes of

10

preemption.

11

A finding of substantial equivalence to a preamendments

12

device has the effect of taking a Class III device

13

outside of the PMA process and putting it in the same

14

category as a preamendments device.

15

18

It is rather -- it has the opposite effect.

QUESTION:

Temporarily, if this statute works

eventually the way Congress intended.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Right, until a premarket approval

application is called for under the regulations.

19

But what Congress did with respect to devices

20

that were on the market before 1976 and those that came

21

along after but were essentially like those was not to

22

require a premarket application even if they're in Class

23

III until the FDA called for such an application, and the

24

FDA has not done so, so I think it's beyond question that

25

devices marketed before 1976 were, and continue to be, the

subject of State law tort suits for defective design.

2

We think it follows under the scheme of the act

3

that devices found substantially equivalent and therefore

4

removed from the premarket approval process fall into the

5

same category and can also be subject, properly subject to

6

State law defective design --

QUESTION:

To establish that, it seems to me you

8

have to say that there's no requirement as to the design

That's correct, and we believe

that's true.
