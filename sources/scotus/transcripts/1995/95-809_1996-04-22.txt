CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in Number 95-809, Lockheed Corporation v. Paul Spink.
Mr. Krischer.

Is that the correct pronunciation

of your name?
MR. KRISCHER:

It is, Your Honor.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GORDON E. KRISCHER

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11
12

MR. KRISCHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents two issues.

The first

13

involves whether Lockheed Corporation breached a fiduciary

14

duty when it amended its pension plan to provide an

15

incentive for employees to early retire and included as

16

one of the eligibility criteria of that amendment the

17

requirement that employees who were voluntarily retiring

18

sign a release of employment-related claims.

19

There's no dispute that that amendment that

20

Lockheed adopted complies with the minimum benefit

21

accrual, minimum vesting, and minimum participation

22

standards required by ERISA, and there's also no doubt

23

that whether participants, employees who took advantage of

24

this increased retirement benefit, did so voluntarily,

25

which is to say, they voluntarily did it.

1

It was not -- it was a new benefit.

No employee

2

who opted to choose this increased pension benefit had to

3

give up anything he or she was otherwise entitled to prior

4

to the existence of this benefit.

5

The second issue also raised by Mr. Spink in

6

this because of his unique circumstances goes to whether

7

the amendments made to the Internal Revenue Code, the Age

8

Discrimination in Employment Act, and ERISA by OBRA 1 86,
the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1 86, should --

10

whether Congress intended that those changes be applied

11

retroactively.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Krischer, may I ask you to

13

clarify something in regard to the first question?

14

your petition for certiorari you asked whether the Ninth

15

Circuit correctly held that a pension plan sponsor can be

16

liable for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA when it

17

amended the plan.

18

the pension plan sponsor and plan fiduciaries may be held

1

liable, blah, blah, blah, and you appear to be raising

20

some additional questions in the merits brief.

21

In

Then, in the merits brief you say when

MR. KRISCHER:

Well, I don't -- I believe it's

22

the same question that's being raised, Justice O'Connor,

23

because what the Ninth Circuit held -- it didn't make a

24

big distinction between the plan sponsor and the

25

retirement plan committee that would pay the benefits to

eligible employees.

2

QUESTION:

The district -Well, certainly the Solicitor

3

General's brief suggests there may be substantial

4

differences in answers to the two questions, and I just

5

wondered whether we should confine ourselves to what you

6

raised in the original cert position --

7

MR. KRISCHER:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

I think --

-- and look to whether the plan

sponsor was acting in a fiduciary -MR. KRISCHER:

The first point, Your Honor,

11

there are petitioners in this case, including the

12

individuals who are on the retirement committee as well as

13

the executives of Lockheed, who were sued in their

14

executive capacity because they adopted or had the company

15

adopt the amendment.

16

But you're correct, the Solicitor General has

17

raised, really for the first time, a distinction possibly

18

between implementation of a lawfully amended plan with a

19

lawful amendment on the one hand and whether actually

20

adopting the amendment on the other are separate issues.

21

Now, in this case the Ninth Circuit didn't make

22

that distinction and, indeed, I think respondent in their

23

opposition doesn't make that distinction.

24

false distinction, because whether it's analyzed as a

25

question of plan implementation or whether it's analyzed

They call it a

1

as a question of plan amendment, the key issue in this

2

case on the first issue is, does it violate any

3

substantive requirement of ERISA --

4

QUESTION:

Well, excuse me, I thought that

5

wasn't it.

6

a fiduciary responsibility.

7

the plan sponsor might violate no fiduciary responsibility

8

and yet violate some substantive bar to that particular

9

amendment, and I thought we only had the first question in

10

I thought the question was whether it violated
It is entirely possible that

front of us.
MR. KRISCHER:

11

The -- well, I think both --if

12

you certainly want to limit yourselves to the first

13

question, the Court can do it, but I believe that both

14

questions should subsume --

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. KRISCHER:

17

QUESTION:

Was there --- and the overall question is --

It depends on how you want to argue

18

the case.

19

we should find for you on the first question is that the

20

settlor is not a fiduciary, then our answer will not

21

answer the second question.

22

If you want to argue the case that the reason

Now, I suppose there are other bases on which we

23

could answer the first question.

24

even if he is a fiduciary the provision is not violative.

25

If we answered it that way, you would -- whether we

I suppose we could say

explicitly address the second question or not, you would

2

implicitly answer the second question.
MR. KRISCHER:

3
4

suggesting, Justice Scalia.
QUESTION:

5
6

Yes, well, not really.

I think most

of your brief went to the fiduciary point --

7

MR'. KRISCHER:

8

QUESTION:

9

Well, I think that's what we're

Well --

-- and the fiduciary point is not

going to answer this second question, but do you have an

10

argument that even if the settlor were a fiduciary the

11

adoption of this provision would not have been unlawful?
MR. KRISCHER:

12

Yes, Your Honor.

The adoption of

13

the provision by itself was not unlawful because it was a

14

settlor function, but even if -- even if it were not a

15

settlor function, the substantive provision of this

16

amendment doesn't constitute a prohibited action under

17

ERISA section 406.

18

Now, what the district court held, and really no

19

one has taken issue with this in the Ninth Circuit

20

decision or under the petitions here, and it held at page

21

31a of the petition, and I will -- appendix 31a of the

22

petition, and the nub of this case is held up in the third

23

line:

24

amendment was the duty owed to defendant stockholders.

25

indeed, the sole fiduciary duty implicated by the

The court views the subsequent payment of

1

enhanced benefits to selected participants as merely the

2

defendant's adherents in his role as plan administrator

3

for the terms of the lawfully amended plan.
Now, what the Ninth Circuit held is, the whole

4
5

scheme, amending the plan and paying benefits, that whole

6

entire scheme is a violation of ERISA section 406, because

7

it -- what has happened, the plan has been amended,

8

employees have volunteered to retire, and they are now

9

receiving the benefits.

10

And what the Solicitor is suggesting is that a

11

plan fiduciary who is complying -- there's no doubt that

12

the fiduciaries that are paying the benefits are complying

13

with the terms of the plan, so what is the fiduciary to do

14

if the question remains open, which the Ninth Circuit

15

didn't really leave open -QUESTION:

16
17

That was the district court opinion

you were quoting from, not the court of appeals.

18

MR. KRISCHER:

That is correct, and the Ninth

19

Circuit didn't quarrel with that and didn't differ on that

20

point.

21

The Ninth Circuit did hold, though, that the

22

adoption of the amendments created a significant benefit

23

for Lockheed, and that adoption of the amendments

24

anticipated payment of benefits pursuant to the amendment

25

constituted a prohibited transaction, because the court

1

was aware -- both the district court and the court of

2

appeals were fully aware that benefits are being paid, and

3

those employees that quality for the benefits because they

4

met the eligibility criteria are, in fact, receiving

5

benefits right now.

6

QUESTION:

And if that point is sound, it is

7

sound regardless of whether, in the act of amendment

8

Lockheed was acting as a fiduciary or not, isn't that

9

correct?

10

MR. KRISCHER:

It purported -- the Ninth

11

Circuit, Your Honor, purported not to decide that

12

question, but in essence --

13

QUESTION:

That's right, but I mean, that

14

question -- the answer to -- all I'm getting at is the

15

answer to that question is not going to be dictated by

16

whether we determine that Lockheed was acting as a

17

fiduciary in making the amendment.

they're saying is, look, what this is is, they've given

Mr. Justice Breyer, I agree that

are that there is no bright line other than in 406 that's

drawn, and that's the prohibited transaction rule.

10

An

So you're saying they can give

away -- they can give away the whole shebang.
MR. KRISCHER:

11

I'm -- yes, Your Honor.

I'm

12

saying that an employer, when it adopts a pension plan or

13

increases benefits in a pension plan does so in its self

14

interest, and unless it violates the minimum

15

participation, vesting, or benefit accrual standards, or

16

it constitutes a prohibited transaction, which we contend

17

benefit payments are not, paying benefits pursuant to the

18

terms of the plan is not a prohibited transaction,

19

otherwise plans wouldn't pay benefits.

20

QUESTION:

So --

21

QUESTION:

He can terminate the plan if there's

22

no contractual commitment to continue it, can't he, the

23

employer?

24

MR. KRISCHER:

25

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice Scalia.

He can terminate it entirely.

5

What the employer is doing is making a promise.

6

QUESTION:

Can you have any conditions on it?

7

Let's say in the initial plan, when it first comes up, the

8

employer says, I'm going to make these retirement benefits

9

available to any and all workers who will agree that they

10

will relinquish any claims of any kind that they now or

11

hereafter should have against the company.

12

permissible?

13

MR. KRISCHER:

Would that be

The first part of that, Ms.

14

Justice Ginsburg, would be.

15

can condition entry into the plan on raising -- releasing

16

present claims, so that you say only those who are

17

eligible to get this new benefit.

18

benefit only to those that release present claims.

19

The first part, meaning you

I am promising a new

But future claims, ERISA would preclude that,

20

and the reason ERISA would preclude future claims is, once

21

the benefit is established and in place, it has to meet

22

the minimum participation benefit accrual investing

23

standards

24

in the future to defeat or defease vested claims or

25

benefit accrual, I don't think the employer could do

that
QUESTION:

2

3

What provision is that you're talking

about?

4

MR. KRISCHER:

5

QUESTION:

6

-- but that's not done here.

What are these vested provisions that

are going to be violated by that commitment?
MR. KRISCHER:

7

Well, for example, if -- there's

8

a rule in ERISA in title I, the vesting rules, that

9

indicate that for the -- generally, that an employer has

10

to vest in the benefit within a 5-year period, and if -QUESTION:

11

Well, he's vested.

He's given up --

12

he has now committed to give up all those future claims.

13

He's done what was requested.

14

vesting?
MR. KRISCHER:

15

Why does that prevent his

Well, I don't --it may not

16

prevent vesting, but it may make it subject to

17

defeasement.
I'm not sure, as a State law matter, someone can

18

19

in fact waive future claims.
QUESTION:

20

I mean --

No, but assuming he can.

That's a

21

totally different question, but if he can, I don't see why

22

that's any different under ERISA from what's at issue

23

here.

24
25

Now, maybe they're both okay, but you're telling
me one is different.

I want to know why it's different.

MR. KRISCHER:

1

They are not different if you can

assure the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of

3

Labor and courts that you are not linking vesting or

benefit accrual to some future event.

5

fact, linking them to some future event, then I think it

6

is perfectly lawful to do that.
QUESTION:

7
8

If you are not, in

And your position is that's okay

because he doesn't have to set up this plan anyway, and he
can terminate it at any time, so he can make it

10

conditional on anything that isn't criminal.

11

MR. KRISCHER:

12

QUESTION:

13

That's --

And I assume that giving up your

claim against an employer is not criminal.
MR. KRISCHER:

14

It is not criminal, and, indeed,

15

the courts as a matter of public policy favor settlement

16

of claims.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Krischer, you just said --

18

QUESTION:

Well, what the employer is doing --

19

QUESTION:

-- something about State law.

You

20

said, maybe giving up future claims would be something

21

impermissible under State law.
Suppose State law says, employer agreements that

require employees to relinquish any and all claims, even

past.

25

don't allow it.

That's against the State public policy, and we

MR. KRISCHER:

The term in the plan would still

6

employees in this case were asked to sign if they wanted

If Lockheed thought that by getting a release

fact that Lockheed was wrong doesn't prevent these

You

20

explain that the State can protect its workers, say, with

What about the Federal claims?

otherwise enforceable under those substantive provisions,

2

it is enforceable and this provision is not unlawful, and

indeed, the Internal Revenue Service has regulation --

QUESTION:

But then you're making a distinction

between Federal claims and State claims who's saying the

State can protect the workers despite the plan provision,

but as far as Federal claims is -- there's no protection.
MR. KRISCHER:

No, the Federal Government could

protect them, too, as, in fact, it has under the Age

10

Discrimination Act, for example.

11

Act, in order to have a valid waiver of age discrimination

12

claims, the release has to have certain recitations and be

13

in a certain format.

14

format, then age discrimination claims will not be waived.

Well, we suggest that the line be

drawn that's already been drawn by Congress in the Statute

under 406, and that is, if it's a benefit payment, a

No matter what the condition, even if

the condition was that the beneficiary must agree that he

won't rent his house to a certain class of persons, or

something, something totally unrelated to the plan?
MR. KRISCHER:

As an academic matter, that's

The other person that's a party in interest

here, the Government has argued in its brief, or

suggested, are employees, that under the Government's

theory it would be unlawful to ever pay a plan benefit to

an employee while they're an employee, because while

what employers do when they sever a relationship with, in

it is prohibited by some substantive section of ERISA?
MR. KRISCHER:

It is not a prohibited

it may otherwise be unlawful under another provision of

MR. KRISCHER:

2

That's correct, and one such

3

other section is -- would be section 403 -- I'm sorry,

4

section 1054(g), which is -- which specifically says an

5

amendment to a plan may not cut back benefits.
So that if an employee is entitled to $1,000 a

6

7

month benefit and the employer amends the plan to say,

8

we're cutting back the benefit to $500, 1) the amendment

9

may be itself unlawful and challenged and the employer can

10

be sued, and 2) the fiduciary, by paying the lower

11

benefit, may be breaching a fiduciary duty to follow a

12

substantive provision of ERISA, but 406, the prohibited

13

transaction section, is not violated because it is not a

14

prohibited transaction.
It is not one of those enumerated transactions

that are listed in 406, which was supposed to be, under

related issues.

acted as plan sponsor, or settlor, not as a fiduciary.

That is a sufficient and, we believe, the appropriate

basis on which to reverse the judgment of the court of

It may be sufficient, but not very

helpful.

I mean, if you're running a plan, it's not very

8

helpful to know that, I mean, this can't be done, and we

say, well, maybe it can't be done, but if it can't be

12

I don't think that's why we took the case.

I

13

really thought we were going to try to clarify the law for

14

the businesses out there that have these plans, so why

15

should we take the narrower ground if there's a broader

16

ground that does clarify the law?

17

MR. BRESS:

Well, Your Honor, with respect, the

18

petition for certiorari argued that there was a conflict

19

in the circuit only on the question of whether an

20

amendment can be an act itself that violates section 406,

21

so presumably that was the ground on which the Court took

22

certiorari.

2

employment-related claims, and that one, as far as your

brief went, you refused to give an answer to it.

4

that's still open.
MR. BRESS:

5

You said

That is correct, Your Honor.

We --

6

that issue is not one on which we or the lower courts have

7

to this point given significant thought, at least before

8

this case arose, and for that reason, that's one of the

9

reasons I believe that this Court should decide the

10

question that was actually argued in the cert petition,

11

and while this other matter is a broader matter, perhaps

12

of greater concern, the Court may well fair better by

13

allowing that issue to percolate some in the lower courts.

14

QUESTION:

But it seemed to me that the Ninth

15

Circuit wasn't making that distinction, that it was really

16

answering the second question against the plan, against

Lockheed.

MR. BRESS:

I believe, Your Honor, that the

Ninth Circuit answered both questions against -- against

the amendment of the plan is itself a lawful act, whether

2

implementation of that amendment is -- is therefore lawful

3

or tends to be unlawful, petitioners have argued at points

4

in this case that, given a lawful amendment,

5

implementation can't be unlawful because it can't be

6

unlawful for the fiduciary to pay benefits in accordance

7

with the terms of the plan.

8

QUESTION:

But they've said, I take it, that

everyone now would concede -- I don't want to concede for

10

them if they don't really want to -- that you have a plan,

11

a certain amount's earmarked for vested benefits, somehow

12

there's some extra cash around, and the settlor has

13

amended it so that it says, take all the extra cash and

give it to Smith, who happens to be one beneficiary,

15

provided he gives to me, the settlor, his house, his car

and a lot of other things that have nothing to do with it.

All right.

Now, I take it, that ought to be

unlawful, but I don't know where in the law is it that

makes that unlawful.

Do I follow it?
MR. BRESS:

Okay.

As a matter of plain

3

language, Your Honor, when a fiduciary authorizes the

4

payment of enhanced pension benefits in return for an

5

employee's waiver of all claims as to the employer, the

6

fiduciary is causing the plan to engage in a transaction

7

that constitutes a use of plan assets for the benefit of

8

the employer.

9

That is --

QUESTION:

As a matter of plan -- as a matter of

10

plain language, the fiduciary does that whenever he pays

11

out the benefits only if the employee continues to work

12

for the employer.

13

and if you count the quid pro quo as being covered by this

14

provision, every plan would be invalid.

15

I mean, there's always a quid pro quo,

whether you're talking about how plans are set out, there

are employer plans or employee organization plans.
When you look at the participation, vesting, and

accrual rules in sections 202, 203, and 204 of ERISA, you

see years of service, you see average compensation for

It's a far different thing, however, to say 406

shouldn't be given its plain reading because Congress

anticipated and, indeed, intended to encourage --

QUESTION:

You're going to give it the narrowest

MR. BRESS:

I

We're not saying that it's unrelated

to the employer's business, Your Honor, and we're

21

certainly not saying that ERISA says anything about an

employer's right to use its own money to buy a waiver of

prohibition that is very strict, it's written in very

broad language, it's in fact in a catchall provision.
In this Court's decision in Keystone, the Court

3

looked at 406 generally and opted for a broad

interpretation consistent with Congress' desire to protect

plan assets, so what we're saying is, you apply 406 by its

terms except where it's very clear elsewhere in the act

that Congress didn't mean for you to apply it in that

For example, you couldn't apply 406 to prohibit

MS. TRABER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

The plan terms here also support our argument

that this was a fiduciary act.

the amendment itself inserts Lockheed into plan

administration by asking -- by having Lockheed collect the

Is it permitted for the plan to

require that the employee who is receiving severance

benefits and payments from the plan release the plan from

2

That happens every day of the week, and so how

3

do you interpret the language there to allow that and to

4

forbid something else?
MS. TRABER:

5

What's the line?
The only way to interpret the

6

language, which was passed with the overriding purpose of

7

protecting pension benefits, and which says in its most

8

literal form that plan assets may not be used by a party

9

in interest or to benefit a party in interest, is to

10

interpret that language extremely broadly and to only

11

carve out uses or benefits which are necessary incidents

12

of running a pension plan.

the strike.

Well, Your Honor, perhaps it's a

more difficult issue, but I believe that the issue of

settling a strike is very similar to attracting employees

at the outset.

result of this.

I would state

QUESTION:

2

Ms. Traber, how would it fit into

3

your scheme if the employer offered early retirement to

4

people but said, on the other hand, I don't want you

5

working for my competitors, so if you retire and commit

6

yourself not to take the knowledge that you've acquired

7

from my business and work for competitors for a certain

8

period of time, and if you make that commitment, you can

9

get this early retirement.
MS. TRABER:

10

Would that be okay?

It's our position that they could

11

do that with their own assets paid out of corporate

12

coffers.

13

that additional covenant not to compete, so to speak,

14

would be additional -- a benefit which does not benefit

the plan, does not benefit participants, but only benefits

the party --

17

They could not do that with plan assets because

inducing the employer to make a plan provision that

otherwise wouldn't be made.
I mean, every time we say there's another -- you

The statistics in the GAO report say that only 28

employees and for the retiring -QUESTION:

7

What if you just had a brand-new plan

8

that Justice Scalia provided, not a plan -- not an

9

amendment to an existing plan, would there be anything

10

wrong with those conditions?
MS. TRABER:

11

Well, Your Honor, I think that's a

12

much more difficult question, because it doesn't deal with

13

assets that are already held in trust, and I believe on

14

separate issues that's a violation of the

1

from holding these assets in trust are many.

2

First of all, the dollars that are put into the

3

plan are much less than the dollars that the employer can

4

pay out down the road, so because the income of the trust

5

is not taxable, they can actually provide greater benefits

6

than they would otherwise be able to pay.

Further, they -- if you have -- it increases the

I don't -- not that I'm aware of with respect to

But it would be your position that if

a company has a standard retirement agreement with its

10

employees that all employees when they retire sign and if

11

they sign they get -- I don't know, they get a termination

12

benefit, and if an ERISA plan refers to, you know, you can

13

get increased ERISA benefits if you retire pursuant to the

14

normal retirement procedures of the company, if any of

15

those retirement procedures in the standard form of the

16

company that's even used apart from ERISA, if any of those

17

include anything other than working for the company, the

ERISA retirement thing would be bad.

QUESTION:

But there's a plan -It says, if you retire in good

standing and sign the ordinary retirement agreement that

the company has, okay, and that's a standard agreement

ERISA plan make the retirement benefit invalid?

11

MS. TRABER:

If the benefits paid out are

conditioned on -- if the benefits paid out of the trust
are conditioned on that type of waiver, yes, it would.
If they are separate -- if an employer, which some

12

employers do, created an early retirement plan with plan

13

assets and then separately say, and in addition we'll give

14

you $1,000 if you sign this waiver, that's fine, but the

15

plan assets are to be held inviolate.

passed 406, and that's what the plain language means.

17

That's why Congress

If it may please the Court, I would like to turn

18

briefly to the issue of OBRA.

make three main points with regard to that issue.

of all, Spink's -- Mr. Spink's overclaims attack a

21

discriminatory plan provision that was put into place in

1990, and --

pages 26 to -- the key provisions are on pages 26 to 27 of

2

our brief.

3

QUESTION:

4

MS. TRABER:

Thank you.
And the two acts that are being

5

attacked are the discriminatory plan provision which

6

created -- which Lockheed created in 1990, and its

7

application to him when he retired in June of 1990.

8

9

The events at issue, therefore, occurred more
than 4 years after the date of OBRA's passage, and

10

therefore this is simply not an issue of retroactivity.

11

Turning to -- looking at the plain meaning of

12

the benefit accrual provisions which are set forth here,

13

the provisions, Your Honor -- may it please the Court, the

14

provisions that I'm referring to are in the last paragraph

15

on page 26 and beginning at the top of the page and into

16

the indented portion on page 27 for your reference.

17

All of these provisions refer to an employee's

18

benefit -- rate of benefit accrual and are referenced and

19

applied only to employees who have 1 hour of service with

20

any of the applicable plan years.

21

It's clear from a textual reading of these

22

provisions that they were intended to apply equally to all

23

employees during those plan years and so long as they were

24

employees during those years.

25

Now, Lockheed, by relying on the proposed

1

regulation, and the Solicitor General, concede that for

2

people who were participants before OBRA all years of

3

service must be considered in the benefit accrual

4

calculation, and it is to be remembered in this entire mix

5

that this is a case involving a defined benefit plan where

6

the antecedent events of service, of salary levels, and of

7

various other factors that are included do not have any

8

clear significance until the date of retirement, when a

9

particular benefit formula under the plan is applied to

10

them.
It's not a contributory plan.

11

It is a plan

12

which is a defined benefit plan, and that's why the

13

Solicitor General says that there is a requirement of

14

including all years of service for current employees and,

15

in fact -- but what they take issue with is our

16

interpretation of reduction in the rate of benefit

17

accrual.
But I would direct the attention of the Court to

18
19

the proposed regulations, and you will find there that

20

they did not take the same position with regard to the

21

interpretation of reduction of rate of benefit accrual in

22

their regulations.

23

limitation which directly or indirectly depended on age

24

would constitute a breach of that.

25

well.

On the contrary, they said that any

You're going so fast I'm having great

difficulty following you.
You're saying now that the Department has been
inconsistent?
MS. TRABER:

Yes, Your Honor.

The Department

10

has taken the position in this Court that the phrase,

11

reduction in the rate of benefit accrual, means only

12

something that goes over time.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

That is --

Where did they take the position you

think is inconsistent?
MS. TRABER:

The position that I believe is

inconsistent is in the proposed regulation itself, which

17

is section 1.411(b)-2(b)-2-ii.

(Laughter.)

that -- is consistent with the proposed regulation to the

2

extent that it goes to the broader reading by the

3

Department, by IRS, to interpret the terms of the plan.

What they go further and do is carve out an
exception which is nowhere in the statute.
QUESTION:

Congress --

May I interrupt you there?

Why isn't

the, what you call the exception built into 9204(b)?

MS. TRABER:

QUESTION:

Your Honor, because -Which refers, in speaking of

10

application, not only to plan years beginning on or after

11

MS. TRABER:

Because you -- if you look at the

legislative history, particular at -QUESTION:

Well, before -- I -- it's not that I

16

don't want to hear about legislative history, but what

17

about just the plain meaning of those terms?

18

MS. TRABER:

The plain meaning of the statute is

19

that that, but only with respect to years of service,

20

relates to the provision it is intended to implement,

21

which is a repeal and an application of a delayed

22

retirement age, and the only counting that is done under

23

those two limited statutes is a calculation of a delayed

24

retirement age.

25

That's a very significant factor.

That means

1

that when they passed it in October of 1986, if you apply

2

the 2-year delay before the effective date, and then you

3

apply the delayed retirement age, there -- under 206(a) of

4

ERISA a plan with respect -- had the option under OBRA not

5

to pay a person like Mr. Spink any benefits until 1993,

6

because under -- they could delay the delayed -- the

7

normal retirement age by 5 years, and then they -- and

8

under 206(a) they need not pay any benefits until the date

9

of the normal retirement age at the latest.

10

There are a

series of dates, but that is the latest.
So basically -- and Congress in the legislative

11

12

history said, we recognize that there is an issue about

13

cost of funding.

Well, you're saying that's one thing

MS. TRABER:

of provisions.

There are baseline minimum calculation

2

standards that need to be met, but the formula itself can

3

be -- can partake of various factors, service, excess

4

salary -- it can be a plain lump sum at the end of a -- or

5

a percentage of salary without regard to years of service.
So it is -- there's nothing in the statute to

6

7

indicate that these two provisions, 9203 and its effective

8

date, were designed to be superimposed on separate

9

provisions, 9201 and 9202, which has a separate effective

date.

raised in our brief, including why are there two effective

12

date provisions if Congress intended this separate

13

provision, which is only a couple of lines down from the

14

other one, to apply to the other provisions?

15

Lockheed did not answer many of the questions

It's just -- they're trying to carve out an

16

exception in the statute that doesn't exist there, and on

17

pages 4024 and 25 of the U.S. Code and Congressional and

Administrative News in 1986 which deals with OBRA,
