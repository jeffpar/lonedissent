ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICK A. MULLIN

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. MULLIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

12

In this case, there is no dispute that the

13

Government made a motion which asked the district court

14

for a sentence that reflected the petitioner's substantial

15

assistance.

16

The issue before this Court is whether that

17

Government motion was sufficient to permit a sentence

18

which both departed from the guidelines and was also below

19

a statutory minimum.

20

Petitioner submits that the Government's motion

21

was sufficient, and bases his position on the language in

22

the pertinent statutory and Sentencing Guidelines

23

provisions.

24
25

QUESTION:

It's agreed, is it not, Mr. Mullin,

that the Government's motion was not filed under section

3553(e)?
MR. MULLIN:

2

That -- no, Mr. Chief Justice, I

3

don't agree with that.

4

Government was brought under section 5K1.1, but it

5

encompassed the requirements under section 3553(e) that

6

permitted --

7

QUESTION:

The motion that was filed by the

Well, the question presented, and I

8

believe it was presented in your petition, is -- let me

9

get the petition.

It's, once the prosecutor moves for a

10

sentencing departure in recognition of a defendant's

11

substantial assistance to law enforcement, does a Federal

12

court have authority to impose a sentence beneath both the

13

guideline range and a minimum term set by statute, even

14

when the Government does not seek the latter degree of

15

departure?

16
17

You say, then, the Government did move under
section 3553(e)?

18

MR. MULLIN:

Oh, no, no, I'm not saying that

19

they brought -- that they specific -- they specify their

20

application as being under section 3553(e), Mr. Chief

21

Justice.

22

What I'm saying is that the court had authority

MR. MULLIN:

1

Oh, that is correct, Mr. Chief

2

Justice, yes.

Their motion was brought by letter, I would

3

note, but was accepted as a form of notice of motion by

4

both parties as specifying that a motion was being brought

5

under section 5K1.1 of the guidelines.
It is our position that that motion permitted

6

7

Judge Sarokin in the District Court of New Jersey to

8

depart not only from the applicable guideline range, which

9

in that case was 135 to 168 months, but also below the 10-

10

year statutory minimum that was in place in that case, or

11

in this case.
The three provisions enacted in the Anti-Drug

12

13

Abuse Act of 1986 establish a regime to reward substantial

14

assistance by defendants.

Government motion requirement for sentences below

16

statutory minimums.

18

statute now, which -- it is found at the appendix A1 --

assure that the guidelines reflect the general

20

appropriateness of imposing a sentence lower than would

21

otherwise be imposed.

QUESTION:

2

3

Thank you, and would you tell us

again what you're quoting from the statute?

4

MR. MULLIN:

Moving down to the first line,

5

Congress directed -- let me state the language.

6

that the guidelines reflect the general appropriateness of

7

imposing a sentence lower than would otherwise be

8

imposed -- and this is the key language -- including a

9

sentence that is lower than that established by statute as

10

Assure

a minimum sentence.
And it's petitioner's position that the Congress

11
12

directed the Commission to establish a regime to regulate

13

the substantial assistance motions to include, and as it

14

states here, not only departures from the applicable

15

guideline range but also departures below mandatory

16

minimums.

17

QUESTION:

Well, that's quite consistent with

18

3553(e), isn't it, that the Commission was to have a role

19

in both of those kinds of departures?

20

MR. MULLIN:

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

21

In the second sentence of 3553(e), and again I have that

22

on Al of my brief --

23

QUESTION:

Well, counsel, do you agree that the

24

Commission certainly could have set up an implementation

25

of the statutes that would have set up this kind of two6

tier approach that the Government urges?

2

MR. MULLIN:

3

QUESTION:

4

I agree with you.

But you simply say to us that that

isn't how the Commission implemented it.

MR. MULLIN:

QUESTION:

7

MR. MULLIN:

8

Justice O'Connor,

That is correct.
And set up instead a one-tier -That is correct, yes.

That's what

the Commission did.
The Commission took the motion requirement under

9
10

section 3553(e)

11

and created a one motion,

12

required that once the Government brings a single motion,

13

then the court has the authority to depart not only from

14

the applicable guideline range, but also below statutory

15

minimums, and this can be found not only in section 5K1.1,

16

but also in the commentary to section 5K1.1 and other

17

commentary found throughout the guidelines.

18

together with its directives under 994(n)

QUESTION:

or a single motion approach,

and

Mr. Mullin, what is the clearest

19

indication that that is indeed what the Commission meant,

20

because I found that there was at least some ambiguity.

21

MR. MULLIN:

The clearest indication I would

22

state, Justice Ginsburg,

23

2D1.1.

is found in Note 7 to section

QUESTION:

2

MR. MULLIN:

You certainly should have.
And I apologize to the Court for

failing to do that, but section 2D1.1 deals with drug

cases.

Most of the cases that involve mandatory
minimums that come before the Federal courts -QUESTION:

Are we now -- 2D1, are we talking

8

about something that you did manage to put in your

9

appendix, or is that the one that you left out?

10

MR. MULLIN:

Chief Justice, I didn't put it in

11

my appendix.

I did note it in the relevant language in my

12

reply brief, on page -- well, it's noted in -- on page 30

13

of my brief, so it is in there.

21

departure below mandatory minimums, and the language I

think is very instructive as to what it says and what it

looking to not get involved in departures below mandatory

minimums, and to basically not accept the authority that

12

is given to them by the Congress, they would not have put

that in there, section 3553, and they did not.

QUESTION:

15

MR. MULLIN:

16

Justice, I'm sorry.

17

QUESTION:

Does 994(n) not refer to 3553?
I don't believe it does, judge.
Justice.
Well, section 994(n) doesn't refer by

18

number to 3553(e), I take it, but it does say the

19

commission shall ensure that the guidelines reflect the

20

general appropriateness of imposing a lower sentence,

21

including a sentence that's lower than established by

22

statute as a minimum sentence, to take account of a

23

defendant's substantial assistance.

Authority to Impose a Sentence Below a Statutory Minimum,

2

suggesting that that may be the only source of authority

3

to impose a sentence below the mandatory minimum to me.

4

MR. MULLIN:

Well, it was -- yes.

It was passed

5

as the exception to the otherwise rule that a court can't

6

depart, or can't sentence below mandatory minimums, so it

7

does create the authority for that.

10

But what it requires is a Government motion
based upon a defendant's substantial assistance.
QUESTION:

I'm not sure what your point about

11

the guidelines is.

The statute itself requires a

12

Government motion, right?

13

MR. MULLIN:

14

QUESTION:

Correct.
Now, are you saying that the

15

guidelines could dispense with the necessity for a

16

Government motion despite the fact that the statute says

17

you need it?

18

MR. MULLIN:

19

QUESTION:

Absolutely not.
Then what do the guidelines achieve?

20

Can the guidelines say that even where there is not such a

21

motion we will deem such a motion to exist?

22

MR. MULLIN:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

No, they cannot, Justice Scalia.
Well then, what is it that you claim

the guidelines do?
MR. MULLIN:

What the guidelines do is require

1

that the Government bring a motion based upon a

2

defendant's substantial assistance, and that is what

3

section 3553(e) requires, before there can be departure

4

below a mandatory minimum, and it's the petitioner's

5

position that under section 5K1.1 the Commission devised a

6

scheme where only one motion has to be brought for a

7

departure both from the applicable guideline range as well

8

as below statutory minimums, so there is the motion

9

requirement met under section 3553.
QUESTION:

10

You are saying that the guidelines

11

have the power to say that a motion to move downward in

12

the guidelines, to depart from the guidelines is, ipso

13

facto, a motion under 3553.

14

saying?

15

MR. MULLIN:

16

QUESTION:

Isn't that what you're

That's correct.

It envelops --

Well, that isn't correct as a

17

statement of law, is it?

18

the Commission can't monkey around at all with the

19

statute, has nothing to do with it.

20

is simply to say what the circumstances are under which

21

you can depart from a guideline.

22

MR. MULLIN:

23

QUESTION:

I mean, as a statement of law

The Commission's job

That's correct, Justice Breyer.
All right, and if that's true, they

24

could say, I'll tell you one situation in which you can

25

depart downward from a guideline.

One situation -- and

1

there may be others, but one situation in which you can

2

depart downward from a guideline, 99 percent of which have

3

nothing to do with mandatory minimum statutes, one

4

situation is where the Government makes the same kind of

5

motion and shows the same kind of assistance that they'd

6

have to show if this were a statutory case and they were

7

interested in the statute.
That's the situation in which you can depart

8

10

from a guideline for that reason.

That would have been

within the Commission's power.

11

MR. MULLIN:

12

QUESTION:

That's correct.
All right.

Then how does that affect

13

your case?

14

that, we'll tell you -- we'll tell you when you can depart

15

downward from the guideline on the question of substantial

16

assistance.

17

If, as I read this, the Commission said just

Judge, you can do that if you are in the same

18

kind of situation where, if there were a mandatory

19

minimum, which most of the time there isn't, it would

20

suffice to get you below the mandatory minimum.

21

Commission might well have thought that.

they're telling you that in this case it isn't that kind

of situation.

the Government agreed in the plea agreement here to bring

2

a motion for departure under section 5K1.1, and didn't

3

state, as they didn't in this plea agreement, that they

4

would seek a cap on the reduction, I agree with Your Honor

5

that they certainly are either in violation of the

6

agreement or in effect may have waived their right to

argue.
QUESTION:

Well, you didn't raise any question

this case?

MR. MULLIN:

Well, the Government moves -- its

18

position is that section 3553(e) motion is necessary.

The

Third Circuit found it that way, so I think what -- this

statutory minimum that may be in effect.
QUESTION:

I have a question that I don't think

3

will bear on the outcome of the case, but I think it's a

4

necessary predicate for understanding the scheme here.

5

Suppose that the court in a guidelines case

6

where there's no mandatory minimum imposed by statute,

7

it's just a question of departing from the guidelines or

8

not, suppose the court said, I think this defendant has

9

cooperated with the Government, and the Government said,

10

well, Your Honor, we're not making a motion for downward

11

departure, and the court said, I disagree with that, he

12

has cooperated with the Government, can the court depart

13

downward absent the motion from the Government in a

14

guidelines case?

15

MR. MULLIN:

16

QUESTION:

Absolutely not.

Section 5K1. --

Where does the Commission get the

17

authority to tell the court that the court cannot depart

18

downward in such an instance?

3

MR. MULLIN:

994(n) does not.

994(n) is silent

4

as to the mechanism in which the Commission can establish

5

the scheme.

6

QUESTION:

All it says is that the Commission

7

shall ensure the guidelines reflect the general

8

appropriateness of imposing a lower standard to take into

9

account a defendant's substantial assistance.

I don't

10

know where that gives authority for the executive to be

11

involved in the judicial function of sentencing.

12

13

Now, I recognize that this is true under the
statute, because the statute requires this.

14

MR. MULLIN:

15

QUESTION:

Yes.
And I suppose you can say, well, the

16

Commission is simply borrowing from the statute to assume

17

that the Justice Department has a sufficient interest here

18

that there can be no departure absent its motion, but I

19

seriously question whether or not the judge is prohibited

20

from downward departure absent the Government's motion in

21

a guidelines case.

22

QUESTION:

Well, I would think perhaps that 5K1

23

that you were just quoting, that requires a Government

24

motion, does it not?

Yes, it does.

authority to depart below the mandatory minimum range.

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Mullin, suppose the Commission

11

should say, we understand there's some confusion about

12

this downward departure for cooperation, so now we're

13

going to speak clearly, and we're going to say the

16

The discretion is not with the judge.

The judge

17

cannot act unless -- cannot go below the guidelines unless

18

there is a motion to that effect, cannot go below the

1

mandatory minimum unless there's a request to that effect,

20

so it's not a question of whether one motion or two, but

21

who has the discretion.

has the discretion to initiate a departure from the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Our position is that- a district court has the

6

7

authority to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum

8

only when the Government files a motion requesting such a

9

sentence, so that when the Government moves for a

10

departure from the guidelines to reflect the defendant's

11

cooperation, but does not move for a sentence below the

12

statutory minimum, a district court does not have the

13

authority to impose a sentence below the statutory

14

minimum.

15
16
17

We think that result is compelled by the text of
18 U.S.C. 3553(e), which is on page 2 of our brief.
QUESTION:

Is the one a subgroup of the other?

Is every departure from the guidelines -- when you approve

a departure from the guidelines do you automatically

approve a departure from the statutory minimum?

said in application Note 1 is that the only time you can

2

do that is under the circumstances set forth in 18 U.S.C.

3

3553(e), so it sends you back to the statute, and what you

4

have to decide is what is the meaning of the statute, and

5

it says that, upon motion of the Government, a court shall

6

have the authority to impose a sentence below a level

7

established by statute as a minimum sentence so as to

8

reflect a defendant's substantial assistance.
QUESTION:

Well, could the Commission expressly

10

adopt a rule that says, we will deem a Government motion

11

asking the court to consider the defendant's substantial

12

assistance to be a motion that satisfies 3553(e) as well

13

as any guideline?

14

MR. GORNSTEIN:

We do not think it could.

We

15

think that 3553(e) means that there has to be a Government

16

request for a sentence below the statutory minimum.

17

there is not that kind of request, the Commission cannot

18

deem it one.

1

If

I would say -- I would distinguish that from the

20

situation where the Commission set up a guideline system

21

and said we will only open up a guidelines departure for

assistance if the Government first comes in and says, we

move for a sentence below the statutory minimum, but the

Commission clearly did not do anything like that.

tell people when it can depart downward for substantial

QUESTION:

1

Now, but then the question becomes,

did it choose to allow the departure from the guidelines

The evidence that they give is that they used almost

cited refers to circumstances set forth both in 3553(e),

which is the statute, and 994(n), which is the guideline,

2

The Government must go on to decide whether, in light of

3

that substantial assistance, the seriousness of the

4

defendant's conduct, the level of operation, and a host of

5

other factors, whether that warrants a motion by the

Government to seek a sentence below the statutory minimum.

7

Now, there are many cases in which the

Government, where there is a difference between the

statutory minimum because a defendant may have a long

11

criminal history, he may be dealing in quantities that are

12

much larger, and --

QUESTION:

conduct, it seems to me, has already been evaluated in the

what extent shall we go below what would normally be the

The seriousness of the defendant's

correct evaluation of the seriousness of the conduct?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

But on the statutory minimum

account that the defendant has engaged in serious conduct

QUESTION:

Mr. Gornstein, you argued a moment

15

ago that because of the seriousness of the conduct, the

16

Government might very well say, well, we'll go below the

17

guideline but not below the minimum, and you say we

18

shouldn't be placed in a position in which we're forced to

IS

do that.

20

But your argument seems to assume that if there

21

is, we'll say, a one-motion procedure and if you speak the

22

magic words, substantial assistance, in for a penny, in

23

for a pound, that's not true.

24
25

I mean, the Government, on that assumption, does
not have to stand moot after its motion is filed.

Government can come in and say, look, judge, don't go

below the statutory minimum.

3

The reason you shouldn't go below the statutory

minimum is, the conduct is this serious, for reasons A, B,

5

and C, and the second reason is, that isn't the deal we

made.

The deal we made with this guy was that we would

MR. GORNSTEIN:

The difficulty there, Justice

came in, the Government might sort of run away with your

into is the behavior of the prosecutor as he makes the

the prosecutor thinks that by filing any sort of motion at

the judge that you had done the following cooperative

things, and then the defendant could ask the judge for a
