ORAL ARGUMENT OF FLOYD ABRAMS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ABRAMS:

9
10

please the Court:
This is an ERISA case, and I think it's useful

11
12

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

at the outset to make clear what the case is not about.
This case does not involve any breach by Varity

13
14

of any promise it made in any of its ERISA documents, or

15

with respect to the nature and scope of any ERISA plan.

16

There was no dispute in any of the judicial opinions below

17

about the proposition that the official ERISA plan

18

documents did not provide for vested or lifetime welfare

19

benefits, and there was a ruling, from which certiorari

20

has not been sought from counsel for the plaintiffs in

21

this case, that there was no entitlement to benefits in

22

this case under section 502(a)(1)(B), the benefits section

23

of ERISA.

/

24

The questions before this Court, then, are not

25

whether benefits were due, or whether ERISA was violated

because in some way there were improper misrepresentations

2

made about plan documents.
QUESTION:

3

Well, Mr. Abrams, in your view, if

4

you prevail here, would the respondents have some sort of

5

remedy for these rather obviously fraudulent statements?
MR. ABRAMS:

6

If we were to prevail in this

7

court, respondents would have the following potential

8

remedies.

9

in Iowa in which they purport to assert, and we will

They have a case pending in the Federal court

10

oppose it, of course, certain common law claims which they

11

maintain are not preempted under ERISA, claims of nonfair

12

dealing, claims of constructive dismissal.

13

QUESTION:

14

claims are preempted?

15

MR. ABRAMS:

And your position is that those

Actually, we have not argued that

16

those claims are preempted.

It is not our position that

17

those claims are preempted.

They also have a claim for

18

fraud, and fraudulent misrepresentation and the like.

19

believe those claims are preempted, but -- so they have

20

those potential claims.

21

We

There are two claims as to which the district

22

court ruled against us on, as to which the court of

23

appeals did not reach, and which are not before this Court

24

because they weren't reached, a section 510 claim under

25

ERISA, and an estoppel claim under ERISA.

5

Mr. Abrams, there was one footnote in your reply

brief that I must say took me aback, and that was the one

that said that, surely these people who were transferred

from one entity to another without a word of notice,

was made to them.

QUESTION:

Are you -- I just -- if you tell me

that that's what your position is and that's what the law

is, that there is nothing in the whole of ERISA that stops

an employer from putting people under an umbrella that is

obligations run to the beneficiaries, and so forth.

3

MR. ABRAMS:

I would reverse the questions, but

4

those are indeed the questions, and the first of them, as

5

we see it, is, is there a cause of action here at all?

6

there an individual cause of action which can be brought

by somebody, or his or her or a group's own relief, as

MR. ABRAMS:

Yes.
That's -- that's -Yes.
-- what his remedy is?
If he has improperly been deprived

7

of benefits, the claim he should make, the claim ERISA

8

sends him to, is a claim for lost benefits, and if he is

9

not entitled to lost benefits under ERISA, you've already

10

held in Russell that he cannot claim under subpart (2),

11

which is a plan-oriented claim, so this Court has found,

12

with respect to fiduciary obligations.
The question here, then, is can the individual

13
14

sue under subpart (3) for the same thing he cannot sue for

15

under subpart (2), breach of fiduciary obligations.

16

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Abrams, under subpart (3),

17

it must mean something.

18

a beneficiary can bring a civil suit to enjoin an act or

obtain other appropriate equitable relief, whatever that

MR. ABRAMS:

1

Not, we think, for breach of

2

fiduciary duty.

They can bring the action, and we have

3

not argued to the contrary, under section 510.

4

Section 510 of ERISA does allow an employee who is wrongly

5

discharged to seek back pay, reinstatement, and the like.

6

That action can be brought through (a)(3), but

7

the reason, as we see it, that the (a)(3) cannot be used

8

to seek fiduciary responsibility is all the potential for

9

duplication overlap and inconsistency --

10

QUESTION:

Well, perhaps not to seek damages,

11

certainly.

12

described in Russell, but is there anything left under (3)

13

by way of a right to get an injunction, or some kind of

14

equitable order?

15

That seems to be limited, as the Court has

MR. ABRAMS:

We read section 409 to be the

16

exclusive place to get an injunction.

17

get an injunction under 409, but it's a plan that can get

does the fiduciary have an obligation to refrain from

QUESTION:

Mr. Abrams,

if both readings, yours

and the one that's being put forward by the other side,

both are plausible, do we take into account at all what

was the underlying purpose of the entire ERISA that's

expressed in its very title -- employee security?

interpretation and the other side's,

MR. ABRAMS:

shouldn't we look at

I think it's entirely appropriate

11

to look at the underlying purpose, but I would disagree

that that is the only underlying purpose.

allow employers to cut off plans, if you allow employers

5

to do all sorts of things impossible and illegal with

respect to pensions, that you'll wind up with more plans

8

area, in the welfare area, can properly be read as simply

designed to assure more security for individuals, except

10

in the sense that I've said it.
QUESTION:

11

It was to do it --

I didn't ask you that.

I didn't ask

You certainly can use the purpose

of ERISA, and I would add to that, the structure of ERISA.

18

You really have to look, in our view, at how ERISA was

19

crafted, what this Court said was the carefully crafted

20

nature of ERISA, and the interrelationship of the

21

sections.

Does it make sense to say that what Congress

to determine which hat that they're wearing, because the

employee has the justified expectation that he or she will

receive accurate information about the plan whenever the

MR. ABRAMS:

I agree with that, Justice Kennedy,

6

and they did.

There is no claim here that they received

inaccurate information about the plan.

9

clear, and very honorably, although we disagree with them,

The brief amicus

that the one statement made to the individuals about the

11

plan was true, that the plan would be the same after, as

12

it was before, that there would be no changes in the plan

14

All the allegations of falseness and of false

there is a good administrative objective, I suppose, in

2

theory, in simply reducing the plan's liabilities.

3

And if these statements were made about the new

corporation and its rosy future and so on for the purpose,

5

or in part for the purpose of causing this exodus out of

the old plan and the reduction of the old plan's

and I guess it's the question which was behind one of

Justice Ginsburg's questions to you, should we read the

concept of plan administration, if in doubt, in a more

expansive or a less expansive way, and her suggestion was

5

that there is an overarching object in the statute which

6

would be a good reason for reading it in an expansive way

which would bring these acts within the concept of

administration, and I guess your answer is going to be the

same as to her, there is no overarching scheme by which

you can make that choice.

Yes, Your Honor, that would be my

answer, and I would give the rest of my answer as well

why petitioner did not want to proceed under the plan, and

they used these people in an improper, unlawful way, and

the fact that they could do it lawfully should not be

you cannot reasonably argue that they have been deprived

duty.

It's not part of our breach of fiduciary duty claim.

14

All we're trying to

The other thing that I -- there's no record, but

15

since it came in in petitioner's argument about our State

court claim, that's based on the terminated class which we

lost on in the district court, and seeking a common law

actions for wrongful termination, and I was surprised to

of 502(a)(3), there is a tremendous gap in this well-

2

crafted scheme that the courts recognized that Congress

3

devised for enforcement and remedies, and that gap is, as

4

has been pointed out here this morning, that you have no

remedy for breaches of fiduciary duties that results in

harm to participants or beneficiaries but no losses to the

Certainly that covers a large number of breaches

We

Why

Justice, it's just not common sense

8

that if Congress intended the exclusive remedy for private

harm to participants and beneficiaries to be under

(a)(1)(B) on contract principles, why would they make

11

administration a fiduciary activity, why would they make

it fiduciary conduct, why would they incorporate in

section 404 duties out of the common law that run directly

14

to beneficiaries, and having done all that, why would

they --

16

QUESTION:

Where does it say that run directly

to beneficiaries?

I mean, the argument Mr. Abrams makes

is that 404 just establishes the standard of care, but

Mr. Abramson, or petitioner's counsel on that is, 404 sets

up the duties.

5

His position is that 409 limits what -- where
you can have liability for breaches of those duties.
I don't know that they dispute -- in fact, I

think they argue that duties were incorporated out of

common law.

incorporated, which again just doesn't make sense.

They try to argue that the remedies were not

10

If Congress had intended 409 to be the exclusive

have said so, and they do not.

in this case, or alleged, were violations of duties

17

MR. SMITH:

Correct.
So you do say that 404 is the source

of the fiduciary duty.

MR. SMITH:

Correct.

All right.

But then, may I ask this

question.

If your reading of subsection (a) of 502(a)(3),

Our position is, as you know from the briefs,

that you should follow the number 1, what you've said is

the cardinal rule of statutory construction,

recognized it said, losses to the plan, so they focused on

the catch-all at the end that said, other equitable or

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

14

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

15

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

16
17
18

MR. KNEEDLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
First, just to put in context the nature of the

19

fiduciary breach claim here, we think it is precisely as

20

Justice Souter stated it.

21

The statement that plan benefits will remain

22

unchanged might have accurately described the plan on

23

paper, but a plan in the real world consists of more than

24

just the paper the document is written on.

25

the funds that will be available to pay the benefits, and
41

It consists of

1

in this case it's the same, analytically, as if the

2

welfare benefits were paid out of a separate corpus, and

3

it would take $50 million to fund the benefits, but the

4

employer had only put $1,000 into it.

5

If the employer said, your benefits will remain

6

unchanged, and the plan looked the same on paper, that

7

would not be a fully accurate description to the employees

8

who were being induced to leave a secure plan to go to an

9

unsecure plan to say that their benefits have remained

10
11
12

13

unchanged.
So this was quite clearly a representation about
the current status of the benefit plan.
QUESTION:

But that's not the point.

The point

14

is whether it is not undertaken, whether it is of interest

15

to people who were in the plan, whether it would affect

16

their actions in the plan, the issue is whether it -- the

17

representation is made in the administration of the plan.

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

Now, I --

That's the issue.
I understand that.

I was simply

21

trying to describe what the nature of the

22

misrepresentation was, but by the same token, when an

23

employer wearing two hats is asked to describe what the

24

employees' benefits will be under the current plan, this

25

is not a statement of an intent to amend the plan in the

future.

This is a statement of what employees' benefits

2

are or will be under the current plan.

3

statement of current plan benefits availability.

This is a

In that situation we think it's quite clear that

4
5

the employer is speaking in a fiduciary capacity, or at

6

least would be understood by the reasonable employees in a

7

meeting such as this, where the employer through all of

8

the communications constantly referred to the benefit

9

consequences of the switch, that the employer -- employees

10

were being spoken to about their benefits, which is after

11

all a classic administrator responsibility under the act.
It is the administrator of the plan that is

12

13

responsible for disclosing documents to plan participants,

14

these summary plan description and notice of material

15

modifications, so that the employees would have been used

16

to, and in fact in this case did receive their

17

communications about plan benefits --

MR. KNEEDLER:

It's certainly not his duty to

MR. KNEEDLER:

1

No.

Our position is not that

2

that's true as a general matter.

In the Borst case, for

3

example, where the employer is not speaking to the

4

employees but speaking in another context, there's

5

certainly no duty to disclose, but where the employer is

6

having a meeting face-to-face with the employees, asking

7

them to switch from one arm of the company to another, and

8

talking about the benefit consequences of that, we believe

9

that that is plan participation, where the viability of

10

the company is the same as saying there won't be funds

11

available to pay the benefits.
QUESTION:

12

13

He's administering the plan when he

does that.
MR. KNEEDLER:

14

When he is speaking to the

employees about what's going to happen to them under the

18

administering the first plan when he makes the

misrepresentation, isn't he?

We frankly think he's

administering both plans.

of argument that he's administering the first plan.

I

1

relied on too high a level of generality of the concept of

2

administration.
What's your theory of the administrative

3
4

character of -- with respect to the first plan in making

5

statements intended to induce people to leave that plan?

6

How does that relate to administration, on your theory?
MR. KNEEDLER:

7

Well, I think ordinarily, when an

8

administrator has people sign up or exit a plan, it may be

9

incident to leaving employment, but it's typical fiduciary

10

responsibility for -- to handle the paperwork coming and

11

going from a plan, and that's what we think would have

12

been happening here, that the fiduciary under the existing

13

plan would have been describing or been understood by the

14

employers to be describing the benefit consequences of

15

leaving one plan run by MF and joining another plan,

16

essentially run by MF, so we think that the employer was

17

really wearing an administrative hat under both plans at

18

the time it was speaking.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler --

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

21

QUESTION:

Yes.

How do you interpret what is it,

22

501(a)(3)?

pointed the way to a more limited meaning?

24
25

Do you think that the Russell case somehow

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, we don't.

employee -- that the participant there was not suing under

2

502(a)(3).

It was suing under -QUESTION:

3
4

If they had, could they have

recovered?
MR. KNEEDLER:

5

Not the damages that were being

6

sought there.

7

we think that's significant in looking at the operation of

8

502(a) (3) .

9

That was straight compensatory damages, and

Since Russell was decided, this Court held in

10

Mertens that other appropriate equitable relief does not

11

include compensatory damages, so the relief available

12

under 502(a)(3) is considerably more limited than what

13

would be available for compensatory damages claimed in

14

Russell or under section 409 of the plan on behalf of the

15

plan, so we think that that explains the differences

16

between 502(a)(2) and 502(a)(3).

17

QUESTION:

But if you were starting on that

18

you'd say, look, 404 says a fiduciary has obligations to

participants and beneficiaries.

for equitable relief for violation of any provision of

MR. KNEEDLER:

will be a self-limiting principle applicable there.

10

No, I don't think there's any

inconsistency at all with the benefit provision, because

the employer -- the employer pays benefits under the act

There would be no separate claim under 502(a)(3).

QUESTION:

Oh, sure, but I think what Justice

Breyer is concerned about, as I am, is simply the volume

of litigation that is going to arise --

MR. KNEEDLER:

QUESTION:

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

But in that situation --

-- when you allow individual suits.
In that situation, if you get

8

exactly the same relief, it wouldn't increase the

9

litigation at all.

10

If I could say, petitioner's theory is that

11

somehow 502(a)(1),

12

compartments, and there's no overlap.

13

All you have to do is look at (a)(1) and (a)(3), both of

14

which refer to violations of the plan.

15

(2),

(3),

(4),

(5) are airtight
That's not true.

(a)(1) refers to specific violations with

16

respect to not paying benefits, but 502(a)(3) also

17

includes other violations of the plan, and we're saying

18

the same thing here with respect to fiduciary obligations.

19

502(a)(2) specifically covers personal liability

20

and other equitable relief for the fiduciary to the plan,

21

but that doesn't detract from the fact that 502(a)(3) also

22

covers any violation of the act which includes the

23

fiduciary responsibility provisions.

25

Under petitioner's theory, the injunctive suit
that Justice O'Connor referred to wouldn't even lie.

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, could I ask you the

question that the Chief Justice started out -- started the

argument with?

7

in this case, would their State law actions that they

8

described be preempted?

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

In your view, if your opponent prevailed

Well, we think that the

10

preemption question has to be considered in connection

11

with the availability of the remedies under section 502,

12

as the Court suggested in Russell, and -QUESTION:

13
14

But what's your answer to my

question?
MR. KNEEDLER:

15

If the cause of action lies here,

16

there would not be preemption.

17

does not -- excuse me, there would be preemption.

18

cause of action does not lie under ERISA, then we think

19

there should be a broader ambit of claims for fraudulent

misrepresentation.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF FLOYD ABRAMS

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ABRAMS:

5

I'd like to return to Justice

6

O'Connor's observation earlier, when you said that it

7

looked a lot like damages.
It's perfectly true that we have not put at

8

9

issue here, and it's not before the Court whether this is

10

equitable relief or not.

11

gave the class a choice of either taking a lump sum in

12

damages for everything, or reinstatement and the like.

13

The district court basically

It looks a lot to us -- and both of them look a

14

lot to us like benefits.

It is the award of benefits, and

15

that -- and it is instinct in that award of benefits.

16

That's what they'll be getting if we lose this case, is

17

that there's at least a potential conflict with subpart

18

(1), or at least an overlap with subpart (1).
We think subpart (1) is supposed to deal with

statute.

praised Congress occasionally for crafting this with

23

special care and the like.

We think that there is a clarity to the

1

course, any well-advised plaintiff will sue under subpart

2

(1) and (3), under (1) for saying, I didn't get benefits,

3

under (3) for saying, you breached your fiduciary

4

obligations in not awarding me benefits, and we think

5

that's not an appropriate way to interpret what Congress

6

meant, nor do we think it's appropriate to interpret the

7

breadth of section 409 in such a narrow way as has been

8

suggested today.

9

I read, in conclusion, the first line of section

10

409(a), any person who is a fiduciary with respect to a

11

plan who breaches any of the responsibilities obligations,

12

or duties, et cetera, as the start of it.

13

We think that section 409 was Congress' effort

14

to deal with "liability for breach of fiduciary duty" and

15

16

understand full well Russell doesn't govern here.

said it didn't govern.

of 409, and of the statute as comprehensively viewed, that

there cannot be recovery here.
