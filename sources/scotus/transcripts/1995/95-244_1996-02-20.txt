ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:

12

~

We'll hear argument

Commissioner Quackenbush is the last of a line

13

of several insurance commissioners who have struggled for

14

going on 10 years to marshall the assets and to

15

effectively administer one of the largest property and

16

casualty insurance insolvencies in the history --

23

Court in California, and we're hoping that during

24

complete this case, and actually the issues before this

Court are crucial to that issue.
What has happened,

2

the Court is already aware

3

because we have explained it in the briefs and you're

4

aware of how we got here,

5

position, and that he urges upon the Court,

6

Circuit erred in improperly permitting an appeal based

7

upon an antiquated and inappropriate standard

8

distinguishing between equitable remedies and legal

9

remedies and thereby prevented, or would forbid,

it is Commissioner Quackenbush's
that the Ninth

this

10

district court, and any district court in a similar case,

11

from considering issues that legitimately relate to

12

abstention,

13

a consolidated proceeding in a State court, which can

14

protect itself from being dissipated through dozens and in

15

this case it could have been hundreds of Federal court

16

litigations, would disturb, and in fact destroy, a

17

fundamental interest of the State of California --

18

such as the failure to recognize the need for

QUESTION:

What authority do you -- you see,

19

when you say it's a matter of discretion whether the court

20

will provide relief or not,

21

it equity or antiquated or anything else, the crux of the

22

matter is,

23

the court below has discretion as to whether it wants to

24

grant relief or not.

25

I don't care whether you call

I can understand this abstention doctrine when

says, well, I don't have to grant relief even if you have

2

a good case, and therefore I think I shouldn't even hear

3

this case.

4

That makes sense to me.

I'm going to send it back to State court.

5

But where the court has no discretion, where the

6

plaintiff is entitled to judgment from that Federal court,

7

where does the Federal court get the power to send it back

8

to State court?

It's a statute that says the case is

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

Assuming --

Where does the power come from?
Assuming the hypothetical,

13

Justice Scalia, you're exactly correct, and -- however,

14

the question comes, is there a Federal -- fundamentally

15

the question is, is there now a Federal court of equity,

16

and the fact is there is not a Federal court of equity.

17

There is a single district court which sits postmerger

18

with equitable powers --

19

QUESTION:

Which has discretion to deny

20

judgments that are -- judgments for money, has discretion

21

to say, well, you're entitled to this money, but I just

22

think I'm not going to give it to you.

Of course not, Your Honor.

ir

QUESTION:

2

equity or not, the fact is, if the court must grant

3

relief, it seems to me the court must entertain the case.

4

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

The question is, what is the

5

power of the court to grant relief, and what is the relief

6

requested of the court?

7

In this case, the relief requested of the court,

8

the key relief requested, was the motion by the insurance

9

commissioner to invoke the reasoned discretion of the

10

district court to apply the abstention doctrines which

11

have been long-established by this Court, and that is the

12

reasoned discretion of the district court.

13
^

So I don't care whether you call it

QUESTION:

Whose discretion doctrines have been

14

long-established in cases where the court was able to say,

15

yes, you have a good case but I'm not going to give you

16

relief.

17

established.

18

Those are the cases in which that's been well

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

I don't agree with that, Your

19

Honor.

20

under the principles of Colorado River, for example, that

21

the Federal district courts have been recognized to have a

22

reasoned discretion.

It was

11

QUESTION:

Without any dismissal.

12

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

That's correct, Justice

13

O'Connor.

What happened was, the Federal district court

14

remanded the case and took no further action other than to

15

send it back to the same State court from which it came.

Thermtron said no appeal would lie,

that it could only be breached by mandamus --

O'Connor.

In the broader sense we're not opposed to a

2

reversal of Thermtron.

3

that a remand, which does nothing other than remand the

4

case, is not reviewable by appeal but only by mandamus.
QUESTION:

5

However, Thermtron squarely held

So -- but don't -- that poses the

6

problem.

Doesn't that pose the problem?

abstention, is that right?

This was a case in which the

10

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

QUESTION:

12

This was -- do I

Yes, Your Honor.

All right.

So isn't this identical

to Thermtron?

13

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

14

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

All right.

So is there any way we

15

can say that the -- wouldn't we have to say, unless we

16

overruled Thermtron, that the court of appeals was wrong

17

to hear this case because it wasn't appealable?

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

Thermtron was mandamus.

review it through mandamus, so you couldn't review it

1

through an appeal, and here they reviewed it through an

2

appeal.
MR. RUBINSTEIN:

3

What I meant by our not being

4

opposed to overruling Thermtron is that we agreed with the

5

dissent in Thermtron that the -- a remand order should be

6

totally barred from --

7

QUESTION:

Well --

8

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

9

QUESTION:

-- being reviewed.

However --

You have the dissent in Thermtron,

10

which did not prevail, you have the opinion in Thermtron,

11

which did prevail, and then the Ninth Circuit, here, is

12

even further over than the -- because it said not only --

13

we don't have to worry about mandamus because you can

14

appeal this, and it seems to me the majority opinion in

15

Thermtron makes that quite clearly wrong.

16

QUESTION:

That's what I'm worried about,

18

QUESTION:

Yes.

19

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

17

exactly.

The majority opinion in

20

Thermtron said that a remand order is not reviewable by

21

appeal.

22

on that as the law, and the majority opinion said that

23

it's only reviewable by mandamus.

24
25

We understand that to be the law.

We're relying

The Ninth Circuit ruled other -- ruled that it
was reviewable under the Cohen collateral -10

-

But Mr. Rubinstein, if the Ninth

2

Circuit didn't do that, wouldn't it have run smack against

3

another decision of this Court, that is in the Moses H.

4

Cone case, was, what sense would it make to say that if

5

the Federal court stays the action, then the review is by

6

appeal under the Cohen doctrine, but if it remands, then

7

either there's no review at all, or only mandamus review?

8
9

^

QUESTION:

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

That's -- it is correct,

Justice Ginsburg, that the two decisions have issues that

10

are not exactly on all fours with one another.

11

there are distinctions between dismissals and remands as

12

we understand the cases, and that's how we find that the

13

cases work together.

14

QUESTION:

However,

Mr. Rubinstein, suppose the case had

15

come up this way.

Allstate sues in a diversity action for

16

the reinsurance claims that it says are due it.

17

then puts in a compulsory counterclaim and says, district

18

judge, you should abstain, and the district judge says, I

19

think you're right, and so I'm going to stay this action

20

while the whole thing goes forward in a State court.

21

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

22

QUESTION:

Mission

Yes, Your Honor.

And Allstate wants to take an appeal.

23

Wouldn't Allstate be squarely under Moses H. Cone in

24

taking that appeal?

25

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

An appeal from the dismissal,

1

yes, Your Honor.

2

QUESTION:

Appeal from the stay.

3

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

Yes, Your Honor, and part of

4

the demonstration in this case as to the problems with the

5

Ninth circuit decision is that in another case arising out

6

of the State receivership court, the Morgan Stanley case,

7

the Ninth Circuit in a similar situation where the suit

8

was filed in Federal district court in the first instance,

9

and we, on behalf of the Insurance Commissioner, moved to

10

dismiss,

11

considerations that -- the same type of considerations

12

that the district court remanded the instant case on.

13

the Ninth Circuit did dismiss based on the same

And so it therefore seems,

looking at the Ninth

14

Circuit precedent,

15

brought in the first instance in the district court, the

16

Ninth Circuit would have sustained a dismissal, whereas

17

because it was a remand,

18

sustain the remand but only, the only distinction being

19

that the Ninth Circuit felt that the district court would

20

not have the discretion to remand even though it would

21

have had the discretion to dismiss, and the only

22

underpinning being the perceived distinction between law

23

and equity.

25

QUESTION:

that had this particular case been

the Ninth Circuit refused to

Mr. Rubinstein, you've raised two

questions in your certiorari petition.

One is whether a

w

1

remand order based on abstention is appealable, and the

2

second is whether the abstention powers of Federal courts

3

are limited to actions in equity.

4
5

Now, if this couldn't be appealed at all, then I
suppose you don't get to the second question.

6

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

7

get to the second question because it was reviewable by

8

mandamus.

QUESTION:

But that's quite a different

standard.

Well, Your Honor, I think we do

In an appeal, all you have to show was that
In mandamus, you

It seems to me that if the Ninth Circuit had

14

known that it could only review this order by mandamus it

15

might have come out quite differently than it did

16

reviewing it by appeal.

Do you disagree with that?

17

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

18

Mr. Chief Justice, we would urge --

19

QUESTION:

Your Honor, I agree with that.

Mr. Rubinstein, what do you do, then,

20

with the Ninth Circuit saying to this Court, we're

21

puzzled.

should be appealed.

23

it should be mandamus.

24

should it be?

You have Moses H. Cone, which indicates it

so far as it went.

the second issue, because the second issue is an issue

which permeates not only this case, but the second issue

permeates all similarly situated insurance commissioners

across this country.

7

QUESTION:

However, we urge this Court to reach

But Mr. Rubinstein, if it's not

8

appealable we're not going to reach the second issue, so

9

you have to persuade us that this is appealable, and to do

10

that you have to overcome what the Court said in

of attack here.

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

2

I don't believe that it's

3

necessary to repudiate Moses Cone, but if you have a

4

choice, if this Court sees itself as having that choice,

5

then we strongly recommend that you stand with Thermtron.
QUESTION:

6

Because, as -- that's what I -- what

7

are the merits -- you're probably almost neutral on this

8

issue, so you'd be quite helpful in looking --

9

(Laughter.)
QUESTION:

10

In looking this up -- we had a case

11

in the First Circuit called Garcia which raised this.

looked --

13

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

QUESTION:

We

I know the case.

And it seemed as if Thermtron's

15

statement, which was quite brief on this point, grew out

16

of two 19th Century cases, one called Wiswall and one

17

something else, which was making a very old-fashioned,

18

since-discarded distinction between mandamus and appeal as

19

a way of dismissing jurisdictional orders.

1

have the anomaly with Moses Cone, which if you stay it,

2

you get an appeal.

3

for the stay, you can't get an appeal, so it seemed

4

anomalous, plus, perhaps, overridden by events.

5

or for overturning it, and so I'm putting that to you to

13

to have the discretion to control their own dockets in

part and also, from the position of this Court, you do

15

have a massive judiciary to consider, and if all remand

16

orders are going to be appealable, then the number of

17

appeals in the Federal system will increase by 3,000 or

18

more, if I understand the data.

but there's one other point I'd like to make, and that's

2

it, that as a matter of substance, it seems to me that a

different, substantially different from a case that begins

So in terms of wise judicial policy, I would
simply rhetorically ask, what sense does it make for the

10

Federal judiciary to burden the Federal appellate process

11

with cases that really started somewhere else, and under

12

abstention doctrine, should go back to where they started.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Rubinstein, in your brief you

make the point that in Moses H. Cone there were separate

State and Federal proceedings, whereas here there's only

Yes, Your Honor.

But there weren't two independent

proceedings.
MR. RUBINSTEIN:

21

just was trying to make, is that the remanding of a case

22

that started in State court, and it's the only proceeding,

sending that back to State court is significantly

different than dealing with a case that starts in the

10

Over that particular case.

However, the only reason that I say for purposes of

argument in this case is because I didn't want to confuse

3

our other argument, which is that if it -- if this State

contract law issues, if that State court in some way

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

But as this court recognized in

No, because there are local

issues involved, and particularly where we're dealing with

20

a comprehensive and massive insurance insolvency, the

issue of whether the arbitration clause stands shoulder to

shoulder with the insolvency clause, and how it

MR. DONOVAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:

4

This case is about the obligation of Federal

5

courts to exercise the jurisdiction conferred on them by

6

Congress, both courts of appeals and district courts.

7

I'd like to address the holdings of the court of

8

appeals in turn, first that the district court's remanding

9

of this case on both the grounds was an appealable order

10

under section 1291, and second that the Burford doctrine

11

afforded the district court no discretion to enter that

12

order.

13

With respect to appealability, the issue is

14

whether there is an exception under section 1291 for

15

reviewable remand orders.

16

not fall within the bar of section 1447(d) and therefore

17

are reviewable either by a mandamus or appeal.

19

courts have authority to remand cases even when Congress

20

that case in order to allow proceedings to go forward in

question before the Court with respect to appealability is

whether or not the district court's decision to remand

rather than dismissing means that its order on the Burford

QUESTION:

Well, what do you make of the

language in Thermtron on that point?

MR. DONOVAN:

Well, the language in Thermtron,

10

Your Honor, as we pointed out, is language which did

11

assume that an appeal was not available and therefore

12

mandamus would lie, but Thermtron has to be understood on

3

the basis of the case that it, in turn, relied on, which

is the Wiswall case, and Wiswall should be understood in

4

MR. DONOVAN:

We're talking, by definition,

5

about remand orders that are on extrastatutory grounds.

6

That is a very small category of cases.

7

The two principal areas in which I'm aware from

8

reviewing the courts of appeals decisions are forum

selection clauses and Burford grounds.

Those are

10

decisions that, by definition, would otherwise be

11

substantive decisions, and if incorporated, as the

12

district court could have here, in a dismissal rather than

13

a remand, would be generally appealable without question.

14

So again, back to Thermtron and Wiswall with

15

respect to the function of mandamus and appeal.

16

cases stood for the proposition that a refusal to hear and

17

decide, quote unquote, at the outset of the case, was

reviewable only by mandamus, and that was the point.

With respect to the Burford doctrine, the court

relief that the district court had discretion to withhold.

The reason why that argument fails under the

17

Burford doctrine is, the Burford case was about a very

specific circumstance.

injunctive relief where the Federal plaintiff comes into

court and asks the Federal court to interfere with State

I don't think that's the case,

commercial action in which the defendant has moved to

Where does the discretion lie?

11

but the court doesn't have any exercise of discretion in

that.
Furthermore, with respect to the motion to

compel, which the liquidator in his reply has now

15

suggested affords some element of discretion -- the

16

liquidator's argument is a stay is equitable and therefore

17

there's an equitable element in the case -- that's wrong

18

for at least two reasons.
First of all, the Federal Arbitration Act cases

20

of this Court have made it crystal clear that a district

court has no discretion to stay in the face of a valid

22

arbitration clause.

11

Justice pointed out the Fair Assessment case, but that

case, even if it is viewed as an abstention case, is

13

reliant on a long line of comity cases in a very

particular area, the tax administration area, and it

specifically relied on a holding that in fact a

declaration under section 1983 would effectively shut down

But you acknowledge that Fair

Assessment is contrary to your position?
MR. DONOVAN:

No, we don't acknowledge that Fair

Assessment is contrary to our position.

What the court in

Fair Assessment did was looked at a series of cases in
which the court -- that arose out of the injunction and
declaration area and hold that a particularized comity
principle applicable when plaintiffs, Federal plaintiffs
sought to in effect shut down State tax systems would
justify a similar application with respect to a section
1983 action.
That has nothing to do with this case here, nor
has the liquidator really ever suggested -QUESTION:

Was the plaintiff remanded to a 1983

action in State court in that case?
MR. DONOVAN:

The plaintiff was remanded to

State court specifically, without regard to what his
action was, but it was regarded -- it was -- the
assumption was that he would have an adequate remedy in
State court and was therefore referred to a State court
remedy.
