GENERAL DAYS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and

may it please the Court:
Selective prosecution claims are among the most

13

difficult our courts have to face,

14

striking an especially delicate balance between protecting

15

prosecutorial discretion and decisionmaking from improper,

16

outside interferences and scrutiny while ensuring that the

17

law is in force in conformity with the Constitution and

18

the rule of law.

19

for they require

This Court has noted that judicial scrutiny of a

20

prosecutor's charging decision imposes high costs on the

21

criminal justice system,

22

experience have taught that most prosecutors will

23

faithfully obey their duty,

24

hesitant to examine the decision whether to prosecute.

25

and that since tradition and

courts should properly be

But courts must also discharge their

1

responsibility to ensure that the Government enforces the

2

laws evenhandedly, rather than based upon invidious

3

discrimination, but when the Government acts with an evil

4

eye and an unequal hand, rather than in a manner faithful

5

to equal protection and due process, both those directly

6

affected by that conduct in the rule of law are its

7

victims.
This Court's decisions, especially in Yick Wo

8

9

and Wayte, have struck this balance on the merits by

10

requiring that, absent proof of an explicitly

11

discriminatory classification, a criminal defendant

12

alleging selective prosecution must make two showings in

13

order to prevail, first, that persons in similar

14

circumstances have not been prosecuted and, second, that

15

the difference in treatment is motivated by an intent to

16

discriminate against the group to which the defendant

17

belongs.

18

both discriminatory effect and discriminatory purport.

19

In other words, there has to be a showing of

This case, however, presents for decision a

20

question that this Court has yet to resolve, namely, what

21

standards should Federal courts utilize in determining

22

whether a criminal defendant alleging selective

23

prosecution is entitled to discovery.

24
25

QUESTION:

General Days, do you agree that the

standard on this discovery claim should be whether a

most of the courts of appeals, Justice O'Connor.

QUESTION:

Is that the

And do you accept that -Well, not completely --

-- or do you ask us to adopt some

other standard?
GENERAL DAYS:

10

Well, I think that, although the

11

courts have used various formulations, the bottom line is

12

that all the courts of appeals, with the exception of the

13

Ninth Circuit, that have addressed this issue have

14

required that there be a showing of individuals who are

15

similarly situated to the defendant.
QUESTION:

16

Well, is it your argument that that

17

showing is necessary to establish a colorable basis?

18

do you articulate the standard that the court should

19

apply?
GENERAL DAYS:

20

How

22

evidence.

about phrases like, a colorable basis, as giving any real

guidance to what to look for in the details.
GENERAL DAYS:

11

Precisely right, Mr. Chief

Justice.
QUESTION:

Well, can you tell us what the

12

details would be?

In a case like this, just what evidence

13

that's accessible to the defendant would be necessary to

14

establish a basis for discovery?

15

GENERAL DAYS:

Justice Ginsburg, the respondents

16

have made the suggestion that the evidence that they need

17

is within the control of the Government, but that is

18

simply not so.

QUESTION:

Well, if they came in with an

affidavit, the public defender said, our files in State

so

QUESTION:

GENERAL DAYS:

I --- that is really circular here.

It gets us back to the point --

7

QUESTION:

So you say a substantial threshold

8

showing that the defense is valid is always necessary

9

under Rule 16.

Is that -- is that your position?

10

GENERAL DAYS:

11

QUESTION:

12

I think --

I thought it was just a special

showing you were going to require in this kind of a case.

13

GENERAL DAYS:

Well, there are obviously other

14

types of material that are available under Rule 16, but

15

the point here is that Rule 16 has to be read against a

16

backdrop of this Court's presumption that prosecutors act

17

lawfully, and that the investigation by outsiders or

18

inquiries by outsiders of how prosecutors carry out their

19

responsibility imposes substantial cost on the system.
QUESTION:

20

Well, what I was going to suggest is

21

that Rule 16 -- what is it, 16(a)(2) makes it clear that

you can't use (C)

addressed in our reply brief, there are specific

provisions of Rule 16 that go to the availability of

prosecution of the case.
Now, I suppose you could argue that (C) enables

3

you to get all of the Government information relating to

4

this discriminatory prosecution matter, all Government

5

documents except those relating to this case, all those

6

relating to these other cases but not to this case.

7

suppose you could argue that, but that would be a very

8

strange rule, and it seems to me that the existence of (2)

(C) refers to defense on the merits.

12

GENERAL DAYS:

That's correct.

13

QUESTION:

And not to a defense of this sort.

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

15

QUESTION:

And that would get you out of

16

Rule 16, and then we could talk about what the

Constitution requires the Government to cough up, and we

18

could adopt a rule such as, for a defense of this sort

19

there has to be substantial threshold showing.

real troubles.

What does that suggest you do, for

example, to suppression?

What does it do to motions to

claims that actually are there for reasons of

QUESTION:

11

GENERAL DAYS:

Yes.

So I'm nervous about that.
Well, I think, Justice Breyer,

that we believe we can remain within Rule 16 and

nevertheless support the substantial threshold showing

that we've been advocating.

That's in essence what Wade

question, suppose -- what happened before Rule 16 was on

it the inherent powers of the court?

There was a previous rule that had a standard of

doesn't matter.

QUESTION:

Are

No, I'm not familiar --

Only in a constitutional case can a

court ever order discovery?

scene, because if we knew that, then we'd know whether or

9

not Rule 16 was designed to contain the entire authority

10

for the courts to order discovery, or whether or not

11

there's some inherent authority, or something like that.

12

13

GENERAL DAYS:

Well, Brady, for example, is a

rule that is outside of Rule 16.

14

QUESTION:

That has a constitutional basis.

15

GENERAL DAYS:

That's correct, and so to the

16

extent there are these constitutional requirements, I

17

think as Justice Breyer was suggesting, they would stand

18

outside of Rule 16.

19

QUESTION:

20
21

22

General Days, are there things that

were requested in this case that fall within Rule 16's
(a)(1)(C) articulation -- books, papers, documents in the
possession or control of the Government?

23

Were things asked for that fit within that rule?

24

GENERAL DAYS:

25

Certainly documents.

There was a

request for a list of Federal narcotics prosecutions and

1

firearms prosecutions that were brought over a 3-year

2

period between 1989 and 1992.

3

QUESTION:

Is a request for a list, where the

4

Government has to compile a separate list, the same as a

5

request for documents?

6

GENERAL DAYS:

7

QUESTION:

8

9

No, it is not.

Well then, it seems to me that this

may not have been under Rule 16(C).
GENERAL DAYS:

Well, if there were a print-out,

10

just like a paper list, I suppose that could be regarded

11

as a document, but I take your meaning.

12

discovery does not require a party to create documents in

13

connection with discovery.

14

Normally

There was also a request for information with

15

respect to the criteria that are used by the United States

16

Attorney's Office for the Central District of California

17

in bringing crack cocaine prosecutions.

18

Now, to the extent that that was written down

19

somewhere, supposedly it could be argued that that's a

20

document that was available under Rule 16.

21

QUESTION:

General Days, before we get to the

22

question of what could be discovered if there could be

23

discovery, you were going to tell me what in the

24

Government's view would be necessary concretely to satisfy

25

that substantial threshold question, and you gave one

1

answer that I found surprising, but it was your answer

2

that even if you had 100 percent African-Americans in

3

Federal court in a given year and 50 percent Caucasians in

4

the State court in that same year, that that would not

5

have been enough.

6

GENERAL DAYS:

Well, I think that, Justice

7

Ginsburg, under those circumstances the Court might well

8

ask the Government for some indication, but it may not

9

result in full discovery, or the providing by the

10

Government of the type of information that was being

11

sought here to the defendants.

12

QUESTION:

But you said that would require

13

something rather than nothing, but if -- I'm just not

14

clear on -- the Government does the negative side --

15

GENERAL DAYS:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

Yes.

-- well, but you don't say what it

would take.
GENERAL DAYS:

Well, I think that the example

19

that Justice Stevens gave, and you gave, would be going a

20

very long way toward showing that there was a selection.

21

There would be people similarly situated.

22

presumably that would require the Government to say

23

something in response to that, but we certainly don't have

24

that in this case, and what the Ninth Circuit has done is

25

completely dispense with that requirement.

At least

Basically, what the en banc court held was,

1

2

there's no need to show a comparable pool.

3

talking about is a comparable pool, a statistical

4

disparity.

5

cases like this there's no need for that comparable pool.

6

One simply assumes that persons of all races commit all

7

crimes.

10

Well, what the Ninth Circuit said was, in

Now, that has some rhetorical power, but the

8

9

What you're

question is, what objective rule it offers is very hard to
discern.
QUESTION:

11

Okay, but if we agree with you that

12

in fact there's -- there are two prongs involved here, and

13

we then pose Justice Ginsburg's question, what if they had

14

It did not meet the high -- the substantial

that is a study that I think proves only one thing that's

relevant in our estimation in the context of this case,

10

and that is that the defendants in that particular

proceeding where the Burke study was introduced were able

12

to show that they could get this information, and

13

therefore the argument that respondents make in Armstrong,

14

in this case, that they could not have acquired that

comparative information, really seems quite unpersuasive.

couldn't have had anything but the terms of the study, and

4

a situation such as you describe the Government would have

a responsibility to come forward and show, in some fashion

think, Justice Souter, that unlike this case, when the

defendants actually show that there is a similarly

comparability between the two populations -- that then

12

gives the district judge some authority to probe that, and

to evaluate exactly what those figures mean.

QUESTION:

So some discovery, then, would -- so

you're saying discovery is a step-by-step process, and the

did make some efforts to obtain that information, and

again, I have to suggest to this Court that the local

MS. O'CONNOR:

over a period of time that encompassed, I believe, more

2

might have been the end of the issue completely.

3

This is one reason why we suggest that Solicitor

4

General Days' substantial threshold showing is

5

inappropriate, and that the district judge must have the

6

discretion to order limited discovery along the way,

7

perhaps moving towards an easy and quick resolution of the

matter rather than wait 18 months through many, many

months of hearings to obtain something like the Burke

It might have been that had the Government

complied with this order, the case might have been closed,

The

MS. O'CONNOR:

Well, certainly, Justice Scalia,

the universe of cases presented to you is much different

from the universe of cases that are dealt with at the

district level, where guilt and innocence is determined

every day, and we are certainly present for much of that.

yet we have seen for the first time ever a proposal of the

implication of selection requires some understanding of a

class, some of those members are being treated one way,

23

and some of whose members are being treated differently.

How can you make the claim without at least defining your

class and hence defining what similarly situated people

engaging here.

7

Maybe I'm missing some point, but I'm saying

8

that if you claim that there has been selective

9

prosecution -- I understand you to be claiming that there

10

has been disparate treatment of individuals who are in all

11

relevant respects alike, and in order to make that claim

12

you have to understand what the class is which is in all

13

respects alike, and you therefore at least have to start

14

with a notion of what similarly situated people might be

15

like.

16
17
18

Isn't that true?

Isn't that what you mean when you

say the prosecution has been selective?
MS. O'CONNOR:

I think I'm proffering a broader

19

definition, which is that at the initial stage it's clear

20

selectivity has occurred.

21

cases, very few are brought to -- to Federal court.

QUESTION:

In the vast number of criminal

Well, why is it clear in this case

23

that selectivity has occurred?

black individuals for crack and guns.

10

you start, but it is not the point at which you have

I would agree that it is the

point at which to start, and that's where we were.

I wouldn't suggest that that is

true or is proven at this point, Justice Kennedy.
If I may, to sum up, I believe that the special

15

standard proposed by the Solicitor General is far too

16

stringent on a claim of racial selectivity and that, in

17

fact, no special standard is required.

18

Rather, the court is compelled to do what it did

19

in this case, which is, number 1, to determine, as Justice

20

Souter suggested, there is some evidence that a defense

21

exists, a colorable basis to believe that selective

22

prosecution has occurred which can be defeated by the

23

Government and in this case was not.

25

The court then reviews the defense and
determines whether the evidence requested is material.
