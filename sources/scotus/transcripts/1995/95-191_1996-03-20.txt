CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

v. The City of Northlake.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARVEY GROSSMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. GROSSMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is about whether the First Amendment

11
12

provides any level of protection whatsoever to a

13

businessman who's cut out from city business after 30

14

years of competent performance in retaliation for refusing

15

to contribute to the mayor's reelection campaign and

16

supporting the opposition.

17

This penalty on association invoked in this case

18

resulted in the substantial loss of income to

19

Mr. Gratzianna, the petitioner here.
I wish to focus first on the aspect of forced

20
21

contribution involved in the conduct of the respondents in

22

this case.

23

refusal to be coerced out of a substantial campaign

24

contribution.

25

contrary to his own political beliefs.

The precipitating event was Mr. Gratzianna's

Making that contribution would have been

1

This conduct by the respondent should be

2

condemned, not sanitized as patronage practice which

3

purports to serve the democratic process.

4

corrupts rather than advances any meaningful interests of

5

government.

6

QUESTION:

This practice

Well, I think that there are bribery

7

and corruption laws that would reach a situation of quid

8

pro quo, if you give me or you give my party $200 I will

9

give you a contract.

10

MR

GROSSMAN:

I think that is correct, Your

11

Honor, but what we seek here is a civil remedy when the

12

burden of reasonable doubt is not imposed on the

13

petitioner, where --

14

QUESTION:

You don't need Elrod and subsequent

15

cases, and Rutan, in order to enforce that kind of

16

prohibition.

17

MR. GROSSMAN:

I agree with you, Your Honor.

I

/

18

do not believe that the petitioner's rights here are

19

dependent upon the public employment patronage cases

20

whatsoever.

21

we've cited in our briefs which prohibit penalties on

22

association, which prohibit forced contributions, and

23

which also allow people to express themselves politically

24

particularly in their private work place or on their

25

private property.

I believe there is independent doctrine that

QUESTION:

1

Well, I'm not saying that that --

2

that those statutes apply here.

3

there is a quid pro quo.

4

established as the factual situation here.

5

MR. GROSSMAN:

I'm just saying, where

I'm not sure that was

No,

I don't believe that within

6

the confines of the criminal law that a quid pro quo was

7

established here, but what we seek to do, and I want to

8

stress to Your Honor, is an opportunity to provide a court

9

with the proof of what did occur, and have a court

10

determine whether or not that violates the First

11

Amendment.

12

What's critical here is that the lower courts

13

have said that there is no First Amendment protection

14

whatsoever, so notwithstanding the ability of a litigant

15

even to prove the quid pro quo that you've suggested --

16

QUESTION:

Bribery laws aren't dependent on the

17

First Amendment.

18

you're saying give me $50 for my own coffer or give me $50

19

for the party.

20

laws have any relationship to the First Amendment.

21

I mean, you know, they apply whether

I don't think those bribery and corruption

MR. GROSSMAN:

I wasn't suggesting that they

22

did, Your Honor.

I was suggesting that even if you place

23

that burden on the litigant here, that he nevertheless

24

should have an opportunity to go before a civil court and

25

prove that the violation of his First Amendment's, whether

1

it resulted from a quid pro quo, or the implicit

2

imposition of a penalty, as it did this case, violates the

3

First Amendment.

4

Because there are criminal laws that exist to

5

protect interests does not mean that we do not have

6

corollaries in the civil law which also under our

7

Constitution provide a means for redress.

8

numerous instances where that occurs, from instances of

9

policemen's conduct in illegal search and seizure,

There are

straight through the panoply of constitutional -QUESTION:

11

Well, his corollary would be, I was

12

asked for a bribe, and I was -- my contract was terminated

13

because I refused to pay a bribe.

14

be, I have a cause of action because you violated my First

15

Amendment rights.

16

MR. GROSSMAN:

The corollary would not

No, the civil formulation -- I

17

respectfully disagree with Your Honor.

18

formulation of that is that in fact his First Amendment

19

rights were violated as well, independent of the question

20

of whether the Government has chosen, responsibly,

21

think, to create official misconduct laws or extortion

22

laws.

QUESTION:

I think the civil

Then you are not relying on the

24

corruption statutes, you're relying on the Rutan-Elrod

line of cases.

MR. GROSSMAN:

1

No, I'm not, Your Honor, although

2

I think that those cases can very well be instructive in

3

terms of analyzing the Government's interest that it might

4

assert in this case.

5

I don't say that they transfer in toto, because

6

I wish to stress that I did not represent a public

7

employee.

cannot conceivably be compared to a public employee.

QUESTION:

He can't be said to speak for the city

Well, Mr. Grossman, in protecting,

18

for example, the free speech rights of public employees,

19

the Court has employed some kind of a balancing test, the

20

so-called Pickering approach, and has recognized interests

21

of the employer as well as those of the employees.

22

think that the independent contractor has rights greater

23

than that of an employee?

24
25

MR. GROSSMAN:

I do.

Do you

I think there's a

continuum on which independent contractors provide

myself -- the closer that they look like employees,

think more legitimately can they be regulated as public

I think that the closer that they look like

My client -QUESTION:

But you would propose to us, at

7

least, the employment of a stricter level of scrutiny for

8

the -- your client, the independent contractor, than would

9

be the case for an employee?

10

MR. GROSSMAN:

Yes, I would, and I think that

11

it's important to note that in this Court's jurisprudence

12

regarding the regulation of public employees and their

13

First Amendment rights as recently as its decision in

14

Waters, it stressed that it really was not the operation

15

of Government per se, or Governmental efficiency, that

16

resulted in a freer hand in restricting the rights of

17

public employees, it was the nature of the employer-

18

employee relationship.

19

And this Court said that what was comparatively

20

a subordinate interest vis-a-vis the general public --

21

that is, operational efficiency -- becomes more pronounced

22

and weighty when you're talking about the interaction of

23

an employee in the workforce, understandably, just based

24

on every-day human relations, and I don't challenge

25

whatsoever that proposition, but when -8

QUESTION:

But there's a real concern, isn't

2

there, for opening up a great deal of litigation in the

3

Government contracting field if we find such a strong

4

interest on the part of the independent contractor?

5

MR. GROSSMAN:

Well, first, if the question is,

6

should there be a cognizable claim at all, that doesn't

deal with the standard.

contractors be subjected to a reasonableness balancing

standard instead of strict scrutiny, at least we're half­

11

said that there's no level of scrutiny that's to be

12

applied to this conduct.

13

Now, even if a reasonableness test was applied

14

here, I would maintain that whatever it is that the

15

respondents maintain they've done here --we view it as a

16

simple act of political retaliation and forced

contribution.

would not withstand even a reasonable balancing test.

Northlake comes to power, and they're trying to put

together a list of their own as to who's going to get the

No, I would not.

Without more

of the First Amendment.
QUESTION:

I'm not exactly --

So you have to remove someone from a

list that already exists to come into your purview?

7

MR. GROSSMAN:

Well, I think this Court need

only deal with this case as a termination of a benefit, a

9

penalty case.

It need not decide what might be a more

10

perplexing question for some members of the Court as to

11

MR. GROSSMAN:

MR. GROSSMAN:

It is --

Harm is harm.
That's clearly the case, and I

14

think in the proper benefits case -- I'm not suggesting

15

that I don't think there are parallels in the law that

16

would support a claim that a denial of a contract also

17

would be actionable, but that's not the case before this

Because he has, in this precise

view.

MR. GROSSMAN:

QUESTION:

No, it would not.

What is -- where I'm having trouble,

5

and I'm simply asking for help, is, forget your case.

12

are important Government interests in not getting the

That is, what's bothering me about the line, and I

15

All 50 States have responsible bidding laws of

some kind.

statutorily taken care of the problem except in certain

instances like yours, and also in defining the word

And if every time a Democrat loses a contract,

22

or a Republican loses a contract, he can go into court,

then the administrators of the contracting system must

look for objective criteria so that they can prove they

25

weren't motivated by the political reason, and at that

point their ability to award contracts is severely

2

injured.

3

They can't use subjective judgment.
That's the kind of thing that goes under the

title, efficiency of Government, and what I'm looking for

is some kind of line that you would propose that permits

that you might have found, and I don't know how to draw

Well, I think first, just as a

11

note, over $200 million worth of no-bid contracts were

allocated by the State of Illinois in 1991 --

dealing with.

And when we're talking about that kind of

animal, how do we preserve the ability of the Government

21

to work efficiently while stopping the egregious instance.

That's what I don't see.

MR. GROSSMAN:

What's the standard?
I think that what we do -- I

think that the Court has already answered that question,

I thought you said, in answer to the Chief as

your response to Justice Breyer?

2

MR. GROSSMAN:

3

I

think that --

4
5

No, I don't believe I am.

QUESTION:

Then how do you justify the

distinction?
MR. GROSSMAN:

6

I believe that if there's a

7

penalty case and you can look at injury to the individual,

8

he clearly has standing and he's clearly suffered a

9

constitutional wrong, in some instance the patronage cases

10

have looked to whether or not coercion takes place.

That

11

is, is the benefit substantial enough, or the nature of

12

tne relationship substantial enough, in order to really

13

make someone alter beliefs?

14

I don't believe that that dichotomy is

15

necessarily a valid one, but it nevertheless exists in the

16

law.

17

who believe that that is a more difficult question to

18

grapple with, I think it is not presented on the record

19

here and it need not be included.

20

To the extent that there are members of the Court

QUESTION:

But counsel, that simply doesn't help

us resolve this case.

You're asking us to say that

me try to put it into the real world for a second.

10

Illinois has filed an amicus brief in this case.

It has

shown that what it did was seek out professional

12

consultation through a professional management company

13

which has restructured its workforce and has provided the

14

very standards that Justice Breyer suggests exist that

15

reflect some objective merit-based hiring.
Since that has occurred, you can see from the

16
17

response in our reply brief, there are virtually no

18

employees who are winning political discharge cases, and

19

there are no employees winning promotion cases, because

Well, but in the employment area, you

see, there was an exception written in to Elrod and

Branti, and that exception did cause a lot of litigation

in the First Circuit.

There were --we had six -- there were 600

brought lawsuits.

That was very tough to work out.

What I'm looking for here is, is there a similar

MR. GROSSMAN:

10

Well,

I believe that the record

shows that what happened in the First Circuit was fairly
unique.
What we see happening now in terms of the

11
12

administration of the Branti standard and the

administration of the patronage contracting case

14

patronage employment cases is a routinization of the

15

application of the standard.

Four circuits have agreed --

Yes, but you've already told me that

you would apply a stricter standard in the independent

QUESTION:

A strict --

-- citing what's happened to

employees in promotion cases under a more balanced

2

but even under a reasonableness standard contract

3

patronage would not be -- would not withstand scrutiny.

4

This is not -- this is a viewpoint-based,

5

partisan-enforced practice that requires a contribution of

a precise amount, and which is a substantial tax on a

small businessman's ability to function whatsoever, so

would maintain --

you have precisely the same case and the same standard if

Suppose that Mr. Grossman just put up the

the mayor's opponent, and we didn't have this element of

the refusal to contribute.

MR. GROSSMAN:

Why should we change the

This Court has made clear that First Amendment

It's essentially the same thing

in this context because of his -- the reason why he's at

the scene performing his tow.

17

for the city calling him out to go there, and I think in

that context the analysis of an independent contractor is

the same, and my reading of the briefs is that the

If an independent, just a member of the public

could the city punish that person in any way?

MR. FEIEREISEL:

I don't see that that's a

9

QUESTION:

Well, certainly a difference is

10

that -- I gather from Justice Ginsburg's question that the

11

license might be necessary to perform towing services not

12

just for the city but for private individuals.

13

think the city could say, you can't be in the business of

14

towing private individuals in Northlake if you didn't

contribute to the mayor's campaign?

say that.

18

to be a license to do the kind of work that is alleged in

the complaint here, which is to provide towing services to

the City of Northlake, and in that context I think that

there would be the same situation as we're talking about.

22

I don't believe that an administration, whether

I'm talking about -- I understood the question

it's newly elected or whether it's an incumbent

QUESTION:

But what's the interest?

I mean, if

4

the interest of the city is to have qualified, prompt,

5

well-performing tow services available, and if it knows

that the service provided by O'Hare fits that category,

7

what further interest does it have in saying we're only

going to allow it for someone who contributed to the

mayor's campaign?

10

MR. FEIEREISEL:

I don't know if once the --

once the petitioner in this case doesn't contribute or

12

doesn't support the administration that we know that any

13

more, because especially in local --

14

15

to contribute somehow means that the service will not be

That's why we are here.

So let's get that out of the

in saying that only someone who contributes to the mayor

can be on that list?

9

What additional interest does the city have

MR. FEIEREISEL:

The interest that I'm trying to

10

get at, Your Honor, is that I believe that regardless of

11

whether the petitioner or an independent contractor says

12

they will do whatever they are hired to do correctly,

13

properly, is not really the point, because when you are

14

forced to retain or hire independent contractors that you

15

know do not support you, your administration, your

16

policies, and your programs, then you are running the risk

17

of that specific, independent contractor potentially

18

undermining your administration in some way, and I think

that is especially true when we're talking about --

2

doesn't -- this is unreliable, it's unreliable, doesn't

3

seem to hold up, since we're all agreed that for the most

part government contracts, government employment is given

MR. FEIEREISEL:

Well, in those situations, Your

applicable, then we wouldn't be talking about it.

understand your saying it doesn't have to be done, but

that the experience is just contrary to that.

side.
All right, so maybe that's gone on for 200

years, but the question that's being put by the other side

is, fine, what is the logical justification for penalizing

15

MR. FEIEREISEL:

The logical justification is,

you should be able to reward your supporters because it's

and you should not have to suffer the risk of facing a

First Amendment lawsuit every time someone is not awarded

themselves as a supporter of the opposition.

be, even more so than in the employer-employee context, an

2

unbelievable amount of litigation that I think is going to

3

arise from that.

4

It was alluded to a little bit before, but I

5

think when you're talking about an independent contractor

situation, you have a lot more disappointed independent

7

contractors who don't get their bids accepted than you

8

have employees who don't get hired, or who don't get

promoted or transferred, or some other employment

10

decision.
So you're facing the prospect here of saying

11
12

that independent contractors have certain First Amendment

rights, and that's opening a potential floodgate of

And I suppose there's no political

division within the Democratic Party, either.

MR. FEIEREISEL:

Nonetheless, I think that the

potential is there not only -- I think it's obvious that

23

it's there in the employer-employee context.

It's clearly there in an independent contractor
context, and there were some -- there were questions

apply to, because --

I don't think you can draw a line.

QUESTION:

Well, on the distinction between

hiring and firing, are you familiar with the Wygant case?

MR. FEIEREISEL:

QUESTION:

11

I think that

No.

It did draw just precisely that

distinction, and said it made a constitutional difference,
but perhaps you're not familiar -MR. FEIEREISEL:

Well, in this line of cases

12

with Elrod, Branti, and Rutan, that's all been basically

13

lumped together, I think.

14

transfer, whatever, you can't make any employment

15

decisions unless the individual involved, or who the

16

decision is being made against, falls within the exception

17

to those cases.

18

Hiring, firing, promotion,

That scenario has created a lot of litigation.

19

It has created inconsistent results between different

20

courts, and I think that that will lead even more -- or it

21

will evidence itself even more strongly in a situation

22

like this, where you have innumerable more independent

23

contractor situations than you do employee situations.

24
25

You have a situation where the administration
that's in power should not have to run the risk of facing

lawsuits, having to spend money on lawsuits in this kind

2

of a context.

3

You have -- that's why there's so many qualified

4

immunity defenses that are being raised, because in those

5

situations the administration does not know, or the public

6

official involved, is being dismissed from cases because

7

they are not able to tell or were not able to tell from

8

past decisions whether the decision they're making is

9

constitutionally correct or incorrect, and I think that is

10

only going to get multiplied if you extend the same First

11

Amendment rights that have been extended to employees to

12

the independent contractors.

13

I've -- there are a couple of other arguments I

14

wanted to make.

15

I'll -- they're in my brief.

My time's running out so I'm not --

16

I know that one of the things we raised is that

17

if the Court decides to -- or before the Court decides to

18

extend Rutan to this situation, I think that there --

19

there should be consideration given to overruling Rutan

20

because of the problems raised in our brief and the brief

21

of the State of Illinois, the officials.

22

In summary, it is our position that, when you're

23

in an independent contractor context, their First

24

Amendment rights in political association do not -- or can

25

be infringed because they are entitled -- the

to explain that by citing Illinois law in our complaint.

Those are abandoned vehicles.

But he makes a commitment to the city

to go, not just to the individual.

MR. GROSSMAN:

QUESTION:

That's

I mean, the deal is --

That is correct.

-- the city gives him the

authorization, and he commits himself to go.

10

MR. GROSSMAN:

That is correct.

11

In terms of the flood of litigation that was

12

predicted here, I'd like to stress that Abercrombie in the

13

Tenth Circuit has given these rights to public -- to

14

independent contractors since 1990, and there's been no

15

litigation.

16

Second, that I do think Mt. Healthy addresses

17

the question of the flood, but nevertheless I have also

18

attempted to carve out in our briefs an exception that

19

does parallel those considerations recognized in Elrod and

20

Branti, and that is that in those few instances where

independent contractors move down that line and do provide

services which, in terms of implementing policy --
