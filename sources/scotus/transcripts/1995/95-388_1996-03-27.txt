ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. STARR:

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case brings before the Court an important

12

question under the implied labor exemption to the

13

antitrust laws.

14

action in the labor market taken by the 28 clubs of the

15

National Football League which enjoy monopsony power.

16

At issue is the legality of unilateral

Using the considerable enforcement authority of

17

the Commissioner of the league, the clubs unilaterally

18

imposed a drastic salary restraint by eliminating

19

competition for a small minority of the 1,600 players of

20

the National Football League.

21

Specifically, the restraint fixed the

22

compensation of developmental squad players at a

23

parsimonious $16,000 for the regular season in 1989.

24

The court below, reversing Judge Lamberth,

25

shielded the NFL clubs from antitrust scrutiny.

found a complete repugnancy between antitrust and

collective bargaining, and in the process gave

3

professional sports leagues virtually the same exemption

4

from antitrust scrutiny that only baseball had previously

5

enjoyed, and that Congress has never seen fit to grant,

the antitrust laws, as it did so explicitly in the

statutory labor exemption.

There have been, Your Honor, a number -- Mr.

1

2

Chief Justice, a number of lower court decisions.

3

the Eighth Circuit decision, articulated what was for many

4

years the subtle standard and applied in a wide variety of

5

cases, and as a result, the sports world, although it was

6

subject to antitrust scrutiny with respect to restraints

7

in the labor market, enjoyed labor peace and a moderation

of what would otherwise have been very extreme and rigid

restraints and limitations on employ freedom, the economic

freedom of players, which is ultimately what is at stake.
Not only is history and practical experience

11

12

reflected by the 30 years of antitrust history, not only

13

is history and practical experience a sure guide to the

14

court in its decision here today, but so, too, is basic

15

theory.

16
17

QUESTION:

Well now, the 30 years you're talking

about, what, dates from Radovich?

18

MR. STARR:

From Radovich, then Mackey was

19

decided in the 1970's, and then after Mackey a large

20

number of decisions in various industries, Your Honor,

21

including professional basketball.
QUESTION:

22

Are you suggesting there were no

23

contrary decisions from the courts of appeals during this

24

period?

QUESTION:

2

MR. STARR:

So the -- so it's from -The 1950's.

This Court recognized

the implied labor exemption in a series of cases in the

1960's.

6

decision in baseball had historically been applied.

Antitrust scrutiny had been traditionally

After this Court articulated the implied labor

7
8

exemption, numerous courts, led, first, by the Eighth

9

Circuit, which was the first circuit to address this

10

extensively in the 1970's, in the Mackey case, invalidated

11

the Rozelle rule.
The Rozelle rule was challenged by players who

12

13

were tied to the team under the reserve clause the Rozelle

14

rule, tied to the team for which they were playing which

15

had drafted them for the entirety of their careers.
The Eighth Circuit said, we apply a rule of

16
17

reason analysis.

18

scrutiny.

19

There is no exemption from antitrust

And why is that?

What is it that makes

20

professional sports different than the other conventional

21

industries that have shared with the Court concerns that

many years, until Powell and then recent decisions

Circuit Case, too, is it not?

2

MR. STARR:

3

QUESTION:

4

It is, Your Honor.
Do you think the Eighth Circuit

thought Powell was inconsistent with Mackey?
MR. STARR:

5

There was a division of opinion, but

6

the Eighth Circuit as a whole still concluded -- and, in

7

fact, we would still win, Your Honor, under the Powell

8

analysis for this reason.
Powell still applied Mackey to say, for there to

9
10

be an implied labor exemption there must have been an

11

agreed-to term.

12

agreed.

labor exemption.

The employees and management must have

QUESTION:

That is the core of the implied

Then why doesn't the exemption

15

disappear in any case in which there has been a collective

16

bargaining agreement at the date at which the agreement

17

expires?

18

I mean, in theory, why isn't there a violation

19

during the negotiation period that you're talking about,

20

whether or not that negotiation ultimately results in an

21

agreement?

22

MR. STARR:

Because the test, Your Honor, and

23

this is our basic submission, is repugnancy.

repugnancy for the antitrust laws to apply?

agreement.

10

MR. STARR:

11

QUESTION:

I beg your pardon?
The criterion is not agreement, and I

12

don't see why, in principle, the agreement should -- when

13

there is an agreement following negotiations, I don't know

14

why that should in effect be the touchstone, or its

15

absence a demarcating point.

16

MR. STARR:

Well, agreement is not, standing

17

alone, the touchstone by any means.

In fact, let me be

18

clear about what the touchstone is.

We think that by

19

virtue of the Sherman Act and the National Labor Relations

20

Act, two laws passed by the Congress of the United States,

21

the issue is, is there repugnancy to applying the

22

antitrust laws to this particular setting?

23

We know that there is not.

We know it from

24

practical experience, but we also know that the other

25

side's essential submission is, well, you see, if you

1

allow antitrust scrutiny, that will end multiemployer

2

bargaining, and we know that not to be true.

3

And in particular, what is the situation here?

4

This is the unilateral imposition of terms of employment

5

by the employer cartel.

6

QUESTION:

And prior to that point there is a

7

unilateral imposition by the multiemployer group of a

8

bargaining position.

9

MR. STARR:

And, Your Honor, we think that is

10

inherently part and parcel of the collective bargaining

11

process, which unilateral implementation of terms is not.

12

That's the distinction, Your Honor.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Starr, I -- why does the conflict

14

between the antitrust laws and the labor laws have to rise

15

to the level of what you call repugnancy?

16

not as though the Sherman Act is a clear, fixed

17

prescription.

18

a rule of reason.

20

certain thing to take place, rather than that thing must

1

MR. STARR:

2

QUESTION:

To both statutes.
-- one statute simply says,

3

unreasonable restraints of trade are not allowed, why

4

isn't it possible to say, well, in the context of labor

5

negotiations, what's reasonable is quite different from

6

what's reasonable in other contexts?
I mean, the Sherman Act is a very mushy statute.

7
8

It's not the kind of a statute that establishes a, you

9

know, a granite-like line which therefore is either

10

repugnant or not repugnant to later statutes.
MR. STARR:

11

Your Honor, the theory, it seems to

12

me is, is there antitrust immunity?

13

the entire scrutiny that you have just described as

14

opposed to, must you at least be subjected to the

15

restraining, constraining influences of the antitrust

16

laws?

The question is immunity.

which I presume is not necessarily over.
MR. STARR:

2

Your Honor, this Court has already

3

charted the path in that very respect in Fort Halifax.

4

has said the unilateral implementation of terms is, in

5

fact, quite a different kettle of fish than, and does not,

6

in fact, intrude upon the collective bargaining process.

7

A trilogy of cases that our colleagues on the

8

other side love to ignore, Metropolitan Life, Fort

Halifax, and this Court's unanimous decision in Livadas,

10

speak in terms of the collective - QUESTION:

Those were all ERISA cases, weren't

they?
MR. STARR:

No, Your Honor.

Livadas was, in

14

fact, a -- there were two issues involved in Metropolitan

15

Life, and Fort Halifax, and among the issues -- and this

16

Court addressed the National Labor Relations Act implied

17

preemption issue with respect to all.

18

And, indeed, in Livadas, Your Honor, the key

19

point made there was that as a matter of national labor

20

relations policy and giving meaning to section 7's right

21

on the part of employees to organize, that they should not

22

be put to what, this Court's felicitous language, the

23

unappetizing choice of choosing to associate together, to

24

bargain, on the one hand, versus giving up substantive

25

rights given to them by law.

1

Now, what is that body of law?

2

QUESTION:

3

Those cases had nothing to do with

antitrust.

4

MR. STARR:

5

QUESTION:

That is - I mean, I was brought up at my

6

mother's knee to believe that antitrust and labor law do

7

not mix, but the very reason that the NLRA was passed was

8

because judges decided it was a fine idea, under the

9

antitrust laws, to start enjoining trades unions and

10
11

interfering with the collective bargaining process.
So that's what my two questions are.

12

is this case about organized sports?

13

special about them, is there?

MR. STARR:

15

QUESTION:

First, why

There's nothing

This is --

Yes -Well, that's what I want to know.

distinction between whether there is antitrust scrutiny

available and whether there is an antitrust violation.

10

This Court's decision in Connell Construction

Company is a holding, with all respect, Justice Breyer,

12

that labor and antitrust do mix, and that the exemption

13

did not extend to the particular negotiation that was

14

involved there in trying to get the employer - - that was a

15

dissenting view in Connell that antitrust scrutiny had to

16

be ousted, but the majority of the Court held to the

contrary, and we have suggested in the latter two-thirds

-- before you go on with that, your

put to you, because the heart of your argument is that the

and yet your brief was -- admitted that that's a difficult

7

time to determine.

9

As Justice O'Connor asked, I thought that we
would be enlightened by the view of the board on that

10

question, because it seems to me that it would be -- from

11

your own brief, it's very hard to know what is an impasse.

12

Is this temporary?

13

that suggests that.

14

There is a precedent of this Court
When is it really over?

MR. WALLACE:

Well, we recognize that can be a

15

difficulty, although not a difficulty of much consequence

16

in a case of this nature in which the employers are

17

imposing new terms that were not included in the expired

18

agreement, and they're going beyond anything that the

19

National Labor Relations Act would have required them to

20

adhere to prior to impasse.

QUESTION:

Well, the concession --

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, isn't it true, as the

respondents suggest in their brief, that the hope and

expectation of the labor laws is that there is never a

complete impasse, that you go to negotiation for as long

When you -- it's proving fruitless, each party

is left to its means of economic coercion, and they go to

expected that they will come back to the table, and the

MR. WALLACE:

There's no doubt that that is

true, and that bargaining can continue, and bargaining
collaboration among employers in a multiemployer unit can

10

continue, but the question --

11

QUESTION:

So why is operating as a single

12

employer unit up until the mini-impasse, okay, but between

13

the mini-impasse and then during that period until they

14

sit down to the table again they have to stop acting as a

15

single employer?

16

MR. WALLACE:

The National Labor Relations Act

requires them to abide by terms of the expired agreement

until impasse is reached, so their conduct is governed by

that.

Is it require or permit, Mr. Wallace?

4

I mean, even if the National Labor Board Act doesn't

5

require it, it might permit it.
MR. WALLACE:

6

The fact that it permits it, or

7

has a remedy for it, is not enough for the judiciary to

8

find an implied exemption from the antitrust laws when

9

Congress never expressly granted an exemption, and under

10

this Court's holdings it's only an exemption that is by

11

necessary implication flowing from the very existence of

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I would like to begin by following up on one of

Mr. Starr's answers to Justice Breyer's question, and that

is a question, or an answer about the choice required of

it is not the choice that petitioners assert.

2

bargain collectively as if they were a single entity.

3

The problem with petitioner's position is that

4

they want to have it both ways.

They want to take full

5

advantage of the enormous benefits which this Court

6

recognized in Bonanno Linen that employees receive when

7

employers act collectively in the bargaining process, but

8

at the same time, they also want to exploit the leverage

9

of the antitrust laws which they can do only by claiming

10

that each member of the multiemployer unit is required to

MR. LEVY:

What does happen normally?

The board has spoken on that subject,

Your Honor.

6

QUESTION:

Where?

7

MR. LEVY:

In its brief in Bonanno Linen which

8

this Court quoted in its opinion in Bonanno Linen.

The

9

board made clear that among the economic weapons available

10

to the employers after impasse was to implement

11

unilaterally the terms of its last good faith bargaining

12

proposal.
The board has spoken on that, and in its

13
14

decisions the board has repeatedly made clear in contexts

15

involving multiemployer bargaining that unilateral

16

implementation of the last good faith bargaining proposal

17

is a -- is part and parcel of the collective bargaining

18

process.

19

It is a traditional leverage.
Now, it was only a few months ago, in the

20

Silverman case, which we cited at page 30 of our brief,

21

when the major league baseball implemented a unilateral

22

terms and conditions of employment, that the baseball

23

players went to the board, and the board agreed with the

24

baseball players' position that that term had not been

25

unilaterally implemented in accordance with the labor

1

laws.
And only 6 weeks later the NLRB had obtained an

2

3

injunction against the court -- against the baseball

4

employers' implementation of that term, and that's exactly

5

what the football players should have done here.
They had a remedy if they were of the view that

6
7

the unilateral implementation of these terms was not in

8

good faith.

9

They could have done that and had a ruling within weeks.

Their remedy was to go to the labor board.

10

Instead, we've had 6 years of expensive antitrust

11

litigation that has plagued the defendants,

12

the courts, and it has poisoned labor relations in this

industry.

who wanted to withdraw from the multiemployer unit in

Bonanno Linen knew what the rules were when it chose

about requiring that employer to abide by those rules

there had been no sham decertification even though the NFL

addressed about what happens to steps that the employers

2

have taken prior to decertification that remain in place

3

after the union decertifies.

4

In that situation, while the courts have not

5

addressed it the Solicitor General has indicated that it

6

would presumably be appropriate or necessary for the

7

employers to have at least some period of time, a

8

reasonable period of time to adjust their conduct to bring

9

it in conformity with the antitrust laws, otherwise you

10

have the anomalous situation of a private party

11

controlling whether or not prior conduct taken by the

12

employers that was lawful on day 1 became unlawful on day

2, and that, I think, would be an inappropriate course for

the court to take, but of course, that issue isn't

kind of a choice in effect amount to a penalty?
MR. LEVY:

5

This is not the type of situation

6

like the Livadas case, to which Mr. Starr referred, where

7

a State court imposed a penalty on an employee's decision

8

to exercise his labor law rights.
In Livadas, Justice Souter made clear in his

9
10

opinion for the Court that if a Federal statute were to

11

impose the same choice, the issue would be entirely

12

different.

13

harmonization, I think is the phrase that was used, and

14

what we're asked -- what the process that's required here

15

is the process of harmonizing the requirements of the

16

antitrust laws with the requirements of the labor laws.

The issue then would be one of statutory

17

The key point here, though is, as Justice Breyer

18

suggested earlier in the morning, is that the conduct that

19

is at issue here is really conduct that is at the core of

20

the labor laws, that at most it's at the very periphery of

21

the antitrust laws.

22

that involves a mandatory subject of collective

bargaining.

that it is not an unfair labor practice for a group of

that decision?

MR. LEVY:

I would assume that there is --

QUESTION:

What would it be?

MR. LEVY:

and said, we're at impasse, even though the district court

2

in that case had made it clear that the parties' positions

3

weren't that far apart.

4

And why did they say they were at impasse?

5

Because they thought, they had the view that that would

6

allow them to move forward and file an antitrust suit, and

7

to get the leverage that an antitrust suit would provide

8

them in the collective bargaining process.

9

That is an incentive - - given the compulsive

10

power, the coercive power of an antitrust suit, treble

11

damages and attorneys' fees, and the possibility of the

intervention of the antitrust enforcement authorities, it

that agreement is not necessary - QUESTION:

3

You see, one reason it occurs to me

4

the agreement might be a touchstone, and I'm by no means

5

at rest on this, is that the Sherman Act focuses its

attention on agreements, and when you talk about

processes, I think well, maybe there's no violation of the

Sherman Act at all when you're just negotiating the

processes.

The thing that the Sherman Act always looks at

is there an agreement in restraint of trade, and the

One point I wanted to mention in response to Mr.

6

7

Starr's comments about the notion of monopsony, and this

shouldn't take long, but there are a couple of points I

ought to make with regard to that issue, because the

notion of monopsony, the concept of monopsony pervades the

12

concept never appears anywhere in the briefs for the

14

The reasons are two.

First and most important,

15

there is no possibility here that the NFL could have

16

exercised monopsony power in this market.

17

that there's only one seller in the market.

bargaining on his own, limited to the last offer that had

been made in the bargaining process?

Your Honor, the premise is

incorrect.

Oh, I understand, but presumably each

Can they only impose --

That is a substantive issue under

labor law that does not admit of a ready answer.

to say, it may be that if you depart from that last term,

and you unilaterally impose -- it's complicated, Your

3

Honor, but I'm being very brief on this.

That is, if you depart from your last offer that

may - - may - - be evidence of bad faith bargaining on the

part of the -- but if I may, what is at issue -- I have

7

about 2 minutes.
What is at issue here is this stark choice that

has been -- that I think Justice O'Connor has captured, an

10

unappetizing choice that I think Mr. Levy has been very

11

clear about, that the real remedy is, in fact, to

12

decertify, and that is a stark choice that this Court has

13

held in a number of its backdrop posit - - backdrop

QUESTION:

That is the real remedy absent a

charge before the board.

MR. STARR:

Well, that is a real -- the broad

18

point that I think those cases stand for, Your Honor, and

19

I cite the Court's language in Fort Halifax that both

20

employers and employees come to the bargaining table with

21

a backdrop, and that is to say that this does not repeal

22

the Fair Labor Standards Act, does not repeal OSHA and the

like.

Those are backdrop rights that the parties can
bargain about, but Fort Halifax makes it enormously clear

that there is, in fact, an ability on the part of an

2

employee, a union, to in fact invoke those backdrop

3

rights, and that is a very critical part of the

4

understanding of the structure of the labor laws.
And, in fact, in terms of national labor policy,

let us remember what this case is about:

an effort to

7

secure an implied exemption from the antitrust laws

8

when -- and I don't think this is obscure at all -- the
National Labor Relations Board has concluded that this is

10

wrong.

The D.C. Circuit's decision is wrong as a matter

11

of law and may do serious harm to labor policy, and why is

12

that the stark choice.

I thank the Court.
