ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY R. OSTRAGER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. OSTRAGER:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether the Ninth

11
12

Circuit should have given a final judgment of the Delaware

13

supreme court the same effect it would have been given in

14

Delaware.

15

settlement and incorporated a release of all claims

16

arising out of the transaction at issue, including

17

exclusively Federal claims.

18

The Delaware judgment approved a class action

This Court's decision in Marrese teaches that

19

the Full Faith and Credit Act applies to all State court

20

judgments, including State court judgments which have a

21

preclusive effect on exclusively Federal claims.

22

believe that section 1738 requires that a State court

23

judgment incorporating a consensual release of exclusively

24

Federal claims must be given full faith and credit.

25

Thus, we

1

Marrese at all, and ignores this Court's full faith and

2

credit jurisprudence as reflected in this Court's

3

decisions in Allen, Kremer, Migra, and Parsons Steel.

4

These cases all teach that if a State court judgment bars

5

subsequent litigation under the law of the rendering

6

court, that a Federal court must grant full faith and

7

credit to that judgment --

QUESTION:
that not right?

Subject to due process, though, is

No full faith and credit if there's been

no due process in the rendition of the judgment.
MR. OSTRAGER:

Yes, Your Honor, and in addition

12

the Marrese test indicates that full faith and credit must

13

be granted unless there is an express or implied repeal by

14

the after-enacted statute.

15

QUESTION:

So can you tell me how the due

16

process adequate representation, which I think is the

17

focal point of this case -- how did the Delaware judgment

18

satisfy the adequacy of representation essential to due

19

process requirement?

20

MR. OSTRAGER:

The Delaware Rule 23 procedure,

21

which is precisely the same as the Federal Rule 23

22

procedure, constituted a full and fair opportunity for the

23

absent class members to contest the process which bound

24

the class, and notice was sent to all class members which

25

contained the outcome of the case.

MR. OSTRAGER:

-- named class representatives,

20

and they were represented by 20 sets of lawyers.

because there's nothing in it for the shareholders,

there's only something in it for the lawyers?

4

that create a special necessity to show the adequacy of

6

MR. OSTRAGER:

Wouldn't

Your Honor, our position is that

7

if this settlement had been presented to the Federal

8

court, which had dismissed the Federal claims, and the

9

state of the record was the same record which was

KO

considered by the Delaware chancery court and the court

11

was looking at the settlement ex ante, and looking at the

12

settlement at the time it was entered into, the same

13

result would have been reached.

14

Our position is that the Delaware chancery court

15

and all State courts are equally capable, as Federal

16

courts are, in considering the fairness and adequacy of

17

the settlement.

18

QUESTION:

So you say that any court, looking at

19

the record that was made on the adequacy of representation

20

here, would conclude on that record that the

21

representation was adequate.

22

You agree with me, do you not, that it is the

23

representatives' burden to show the adequacy and not the

24

objectors' burden to show the inadequacy?

2

Rule 23 procedure, to make a determination concerning the

3

adequacy of representation.

4

QUESTION:

Who has the burden under Rule 23?

5

MR. OSTRAGER:

I believe it would be the class

6

representatives, and I believe it important to know that

7

in this case, in which the adequacy of representation was

8

actually litigated, the respondents in this case were not

Who are the objectors?
The objectors in this case were a

That appears

So we have a situation where there was full

4

litigation on the issue of adequacy of representation.

5

Many of the due process issues that are asserted here but

6

which were not considered by the Ninth Circuit at all in

7

its opinion, were raised in the Delaware chancery court.
QUESTION:

8

9

But the full litigation is still what

I don't have a clear picture of, and you told me that

10

there were objections, and then I didn't -- I wasn't clear

11

on how the representative met its burden of showing that,

12

despite those objections, its representation was indeed

3

adequate.

MR. OSTRAGER:

QUESTION:

MR. OSTRAGER:

What was the evidence of that?
The representatives presented to

the Delaware chancery court a full record of the totality

of circumstances that preceded the settlement.

making that determination, where would I find it?

representation was adequate, the full record.

Everything -- the record on which the

MR. OSTRAGER:

The full record includes the

10

submissions by the class representatives of all the

11

proceedings in the court, and among the places where these

12

are found are at the Joint Appendix at 269, 270, 271, and

13

those pages reference exhibits that were included in the

submissions to the Delaware chancery court which reflected

the entire history of the litigation before the Delaware

chancery court and the entire history of the litigation in

the Federal court.

18

QUESTION:

Was it after that record had been

19

assembled and reviewed at the trial level that the trial

judge made the remark that there was perhaps a whiff of

correctly, assumed that the burden of proving inadequate

that -- is that correct?
MR. OSTRAGER:

the Delaware chancery court found was that the

MR. OSTRAGER:

I believe that his conclusion was

that the representatives were adequate and had fairly

represented the class, and that any suggestion to the

12

contrary was unfounded.
QUESTION:

13

Mr. Ostrager, on what authority do

14

you base your statement to Justice Ginsburg that the

15

burden of proof was on the class members to prove the

16

adequacy?

17

MR. OSTRAGER:

Well, I believe that the concept

18

of representative action is such that the court must make

19

a finding in order to bind class members that

representation is adequate.

2

this issue was fully and fairly litigated before the

should be issue preclusion.

Is there any case authority for who

Do you know of any cases that decide that question?

Can I ask you a slightly -- the

notice was adequate, and all the constitutional requisites

14

are complied with.

15

Then is that finding itself binding upon a later

person who believes to the contrary come into Federal

court and ask them to relitigate that on the ground that

I believe this Court answered

that precise question head on in the Shutts case.

QUESTION:

MR. OSTRAGER:

In Shutts the Court, discussing

12

an opt-out settlement -- and we are dealing in this case

13

with an opt-out settlement.

MR. OSTRAGER:

10

QUESTION:

MR. OSTRAGER:

-- in the Delaware court.

-- is the case that says I'm bound.
Yes, and the Shutts case says

that it is the rare absent class member whose claim is so

important that he shouldn't be bound if he doesn't execute

Honor.

2

QUESTION:

Shutts says that.

3

QUESTION:

Did the Ninth Circuit deal with these

4

questions at all about adequacy of representation or due

5

process?

6

MR. OSTRAGER:

7

QUESTION:

No, it did not, Your Honor.

Let me go back to Justice Breyer's

8

question.

I suppose ultimately the justification for the

9

conclusion that you press on him is that somehow there's

10

got to be a way of managing class actions, and once in a
while somebody's going to get hurt, possibly, but not hurt

2

very much, and that's simply a price that we've got to

3

pay.

4

One, I guess, objection to that line of argument

5

is, is the argument that in fact when State courts are

6

dealing with settlements of class actions which purport to

7

cover exclusively Federal claims, they have no legal

8

authority to authorize class representatives to make these

9

ostensibly binding agreements with respect to the Federal

20

claims at all.

21

What is your answer to that?

22

MR. OSTRAGER:

Other than the Ninth Circuit

23

decision, we are aware of no decision in the Federal

24

system which holds that a court cannot resolve

3

QUESTION:

Yes, but why shouldn't there be such

a decision?
MR. OSTRAGER:

There shouldn't be such a

4

decision because in a long line of cases this Court has

5

recognized the importance of finality in transactions and

6

litigations.

7

If I may for one moment talk --

8

QUESTION:

9

May I ask you just -- before you

proceed on that line, we left one thing dangling,

10

The question was, who has the burden,

11

the Chief that that's not really clear.

This

2

is the part I don't understand.
Of course you can exercise a release to a

3

contract without a judgment, but why couldn't you also put

4

it in a judgment, and if you also put it in a judgment,

5

why wouldn't the Full Faith and Credit Clause require that

judgment to bind other States?

7

MR. MONAGHAN:

If you put it in a judgment, you

8

get the status of a judgment lienor, to start with, as a

9

matter of State law, but if it's exclusively within the --

10

if the claim is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the

attack for due process, so that now we're depending not on

the efficacy of State law and the full faith statute,

22

Mm-hmm.

How do I get that Federal claim

released?

MR. MONAGHAN:

He can -- if he's appointed by

the court, he could release the claim as a matter of

contract.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY R. OSTRAGER

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

3

MR. OSTRAGER:

With respect to the Supremacy-

4

Clause argument advanced by respondents, we submit that

5

the respondents have made a fatal concession to that

6

argument in footnote 26 of their brief, in which

7

respondents concede that individuals can release Federal

8

claims in a State court proceeding, and a derivative

9

action in a State court can release Federal claims.

10

That same concession is made by the Ninth

11

Circuit in its opinion, and that appears in the

12

petitioner's appendix at page 38 and footnote 32.

3

Manifestly, if Federal claims can be dismissed

4

in the context of an individual action or in a derivative

5

action, then there's no Federal supremacy issue here, and

6

there's also no Federal preemption issue here.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Ostrager, your knowledge of

8

Delaware -- under your knowledge of Delaware law, if the

9

members purportedly represented here wanted to have this

20

judgment reopened on the basis of the Delaware supreme

21

court's full development in the Prezant case, would it be

22

possible to make an application to reopen this judgment

23

under Delaware law on --

MR. OSTRAGER:

Delaware law has the equivalent

of Federal Rule 60, and so there could be such an

application made.
I'd like, if I could, to address myself briefly

3

to the issue of the implied or express repeal of 1738.

4

This Court held in Shearson v. McMahon that parties could

5

contractually agree to have Federal securities laws

6

arbitrated.

7
8

9

In the Mitsubishi case, this Court held that
Federal antitrust claims could be arbitrated.
Since the Becher case in 1929, when Justice

10

Holmes wrote that there can be issue preclusion that will

11

terminate a Federal patent case on the basis of findings

12

in a State court, it can't seriously be contended that

13

what occurs in lawfully constituted State proceedings

14

cannot impact and, indeed, determine Federal proceedings.

15

In Allen v. McCurry, this Court,

in terms of

16

interpreting section 1738, held "Congress has specifically

17

required all Federal courts to give preclusive effect to

18

State court judgments whenever the courts of a State --

Yes, but supposing a State court had

Fully litigated, and a State court

came to that conclusion.

MR. OSTRAGER:

In that case, review would be
