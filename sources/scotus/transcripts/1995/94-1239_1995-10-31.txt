Mr. Cummings.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JASPER L. CUMMINGS, JR.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. CUMMINGS:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The outcome of this case will depend on three

11
12

points.

First, the North Carolina tax upon the intangible

13

value of stock discriminates, both facially and in actual

14

operation, against interstate commerce.

15

Second, there is no defense to this

16

discrimination either under the compensating tax defense

17

or otherwise.

18
19
20

Thirdly, this case is not controlled by the 1912
decision in Darnell v. Indiana.
First, I would like to speak to the

21

discrimination.

That the discrimination in the tax is

22

facial is admitted either explicitly or implicitly by the

23

decision of the North Carolina supreme court and by the

24

State in its brief before this Court.

25

that facial discrimination, there would not be necessary

1

the attempt to prove the compensatory tax defense which

2

both the State supreme court and the State before this

3

Court have argued.

4

Not only is there facial discrimination against

5

interstate commerce, but perhaps more importantly, this

6

tax - -

7

QUESTION:

May I just ask you, it's really not

8

discrimination against commerce as it's discrimination

9

against those who own stock that -- the company of which

10

does business elsewhere.

11

stock ownership, not against the activity, is what I'm

12

saying.

13

taxed differently.

14

It's discrimination against the

The ownership in different kinds of companies is

MR. CUMMINGS:

That's correct, Your Honor, just

15

as in the very early case of I. M. Darnell Company, which

16

in fact was the same corporation involved in the Darnell

17

case, the company that receives logs shipped from another

18

State and was taxed in that case differently from logs

19

that it had received from the taxing State, while it might

20

not have been the outside shipper of the logs, it suffered

21

the first impact of discrimination.

22

QUESTION:

in the company the tax on the stock there?

QUESTION:

2

MR. CUMMINGS:

3

QUESTION:

4

Here it is, yes.
-- on stock, yes, sir.

It wasn't in that case though, was

it?
MR. CUMMINGS:

5

Well, there it was a tax on logs

6

which were owned by the in-State company, but we've had

7

many cases before this Court where the party who was

8

objecting before this Court was not the party dealing in

9

interstate commerce but was just a local party who had

10

dealt with someone who was in interstate commerce.
QUESTION:

11

But have we squarely held that it

12

would be impermissible to tax at a different rate the

13

ownership in stock of a company that did its business in

14

the State, as opposed to stock in a company that only did

15

its business out of State?

16

you know, half -- just the extreme polar cases.

17

that -- you think that's clearly invalid.

18

MR. CUMMINGS:

19

QUESTION:

20

Forget all the gradations of,
Is

Yes, sir.

And what is the closest case on that

point, in your view?

21

MR. CUMMINGS:

The closest case to the facts in

22

this case, I believe, is Westinghouse v. Tully, the 1984

23

decision of this Court written, I believe, by Justice

24

Blackmun.

25

Westinghouse v. Tully also involved the tax on a

1

shareholder.

The shareholder in that case was

2

Westinghouse Corporation.

3

DISC, a domestic international sales corporation, and the

4

tax at issue was the parent's franchise tax.

5

franchise tax was computed in a way that increased the

6

parent's franchise tax as the subsidiaries exports through

7

the ports of other States increased.

8

that the exports through the ports of the State of New

9

York stayed the same, but if the subsidiary did more

It had a subsidiary that was a

The

It didn't matter

10

activity in interstate commerce, the shareholders'

11

franchise tax went up.

12

13
14
15

16

We submit that that same type of discrimination
exists here.

Under the --

QUESTION:

The Court -- are you saying the Court

struck down the tax in Westinghouse v. Tully?
MR. CUMMINGS:

Yes, Your Honor, the Court struck

17

down the tax on the shareholder, which was a franchise tax

18

in that case.

19

So we have here both the facial discrimination,

20

which as I indicated was admitted both in the brief and by

21

the North Carolina supreme court, we have the actual

22

penalty against interstate commerce, in that here the

23

corporation could do the same amount of business in the

24

State of North Carolina but could expand its business in

25

interstate commerce and as a result of that the

1
2

shareholders' stock tax will go up.
So therefore the two taxes, the stock tax which

3

my client has paid and the corporate income tax which is

4

said to be a compensatory tax, which we will get to in a

5

minute, are not in this case mutually exclusive proxies

6

for each other.

7

This is not an either-or case.

This is not a situation where one tax goes down

8

and the other tax goes up.

Just as in Westinghouse v.

9

Tully, or by analogy to that, the tax paid by the

10

corporation to North Carolina could remain the same, the

11

shareholders' tax could go up just because the subsidiary

12

of the corporation had increased this interstate commerce.

3

Having shown both actual and facial

4

discrimination against interstate commerce, we turn to the

5

compensating tax defense on which the State and the North

6

Carolina supreme court primarily relied.

7

First, it is important to notice that the

8

compensating tax defense has never been allowed to impose

9

an actual penalty on interstate commerce by its operation.

20

As I have illustrated, it would do so if it were allowed

21

to be applied in this case.

22

QUESTION:

Your theory of the penalty is the

23

theory that, in effect, the investment will be siphoned

24

out of interstate commerce and into investment in

25

corporations that do business solely intrastate.

MR. CUMMINGS:

2

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Is that argument affected by the fact

3

that, by and large, the investment market is a national

4

investment market?

5

entirely in the State, your argument would be a very

6

strong one.

8

intra rather than interstate investment in effect going to

9

be diluted almost to the point of the incidental by the

I mean, if the stock were being sold

Stock characteristically, though, is sold on

10

fact that we have a national market, and that the investor

11

in Oregon isn't going to be worrying about this?

12

MR. CUMMINGS:

Your Honor, it might be somewhat

13

invested.

14

from many persons in North Carolina they like to invest in

15

corporations like CP&L, Carolina Power & Light, Duke

16

Power, local corporations that they know about, and it

17

motivates them, and there is some evidence in the record

18

of this motivation -- there's an affidavit -- to invest in

19

a corporation in which there will be less intangibles

20

taxed.

21

I can say from personal experience that I know

There are many decisions of this Court stating

22

that we do not need to know how great the impact on

23

interstate commerce is to strike down discrimination.

court of the State of Kentucky, in a case titled

St. Ledger, dealt with a very similar tax upholding it,

2

relying on the Darnell case, which we will come to in a

3

minute, but finding, as a factual matter, the very

4

discrimination that you just described to actually occur

5

and to be a concern to that court, by analogy.
QUESTION:

6

Why do you say that none of the other

7

compensating facts cases involve any discrimination,

8

discriminatory effect on interstate commerce?

9

think even the classic one does.

10

I would

I mean, that is the

offsetting sales and use taxes.
Every time such a tax is imposed, it becomes

11
12

much less attractive to buy a car in another State where

13

there's no sales tax.

14

sales tax in Virginia and no sales tax in North Carolina,

15

I will go and buy my car in North Carolina all the time.

I mean, you know, if there's a

MR. CUMMINGS:

I don't think that sort of

interstate luring by nontaxation is the type --

18

QUESTION:

Oh, you can call it luring, but any

19

difference in price is a luring.

20

difference of price caused by the imposition of a sales

21

tax.

22

MR. CUMMINGS:

This happens to be a

Well, up to this point, this

23

Court's opinions in that type of case have -- by my

24

reading have looked to two types of discrimination.

25

First, is the imported good taxed by this State?
9

1

Let's talk about the State of North Carolina.

2

Is the imported car taxed by North Carolina at the same

3

rate as the car bought locally?

4

that's the first cut that there is no discrimination.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. CUMMINGS:

If the answer is yes,

Okay.
Then, as this Court discussed in

7

the decision in Jefferson Lines, there needs to be a

8

credit applied by this State -- let's say North

9

Carolina -- for any sales tax paid to the other State from

10

which the car was imported.

11

that's the second cut to ensure that there is no

12

interstate discrimination.
QUESTION:

13

Okay.

When that credit is applied,

Well, you can say that there

14

cannot be undue interstate discrimination, perhaps, no

15

more than is necessary to prevent your higher taxes from

16

having what would be the normal economic effect of higher

17

taxes.

18

MR. CUMMINGS:

Perhaps the response to your

19

question would be a statement that was made in Armco v.

20

Hardesty, which is a very important case to us.

21

may recall, in Armco v. Hardesty, there was concern about

22

the fact that out-of-State manufacturers had to pay the

23

in-State wholesaling tax, but in-State manufacturers only

24

had to pay the in-State manufacturing tax and did not have

25

to pay the wholesaling tax.

(800) FOR DEPO

As you

The decision -- of course, that was struck down.

1
2

The decision posited the situation where one State might

3

impose simply a wholesaling tax and one State might impose

4

simply a manufacturing tax, and the decision said that

5

would be okay, that's not a discrimination, and I think

6

that's somewhat analogous to your situation that one State

7

might choose not to tax at all, and another State might

8

tax.
QUESTION:

10

Now, in order to win, Mr. Cummings, I

guess you would have to persuade us to overrule Darnell.
MR. CUMMINGS:

11

Your Honor, no.

I believe

12

Darnell -- if it please the Court, I believe Darnell can

13

be distinguished.

14

do ask you to overrule it, and if you'd like me to turn to

15

Darnell now, I will.

16

If you choose not to distinguish it, we

Darnell is a very cryptic decision.

It's a

17

decision that is hard to understand, and it's hard to

18

understand the facts without resort to the decision of the

1

underlying Indiana supreme court, which I've done and will

20

embroider a little bit on the facts of Darnell.
QUESTION:

21
22

Well, when you say embroider, you

mean take it from the Indiana --

23

MR. CUMMINGS:

Take it from the Indiana supreme

24

court -- I certainly will not add to that -- yes, Your

25

Honor.

It is important to notice that in Darnell there

1

2

was not the set of facts that we had here.

In Darnell,

3

there was not a situation where the tax paid by the

4

corporation to the State of Indiana could remain level,

5

and the tax paid by the shareholder could increase,

6

because the corporation had entered into interstate

7

commerce.

8

worked.

That was not the way the regime in Indiana

The regime in Indiana was a true, either-or

9
10

situation.

11

The taxpayers would either pay one or the other.

12

It was a true set of mutually exclusive taxes.

What the State of Indiana tried to do, I

13

believe, was to tax all stock that it could get its hands

14

on at 100 percent.

15

resident in an out-of-State corporation, the State of

16

Indiana made that local shareholder pay tax on 100 percent

17

of the value of the stock he owned, a very unremarkable

18

sort of tax, sort of property tax.

19

If the stock were owned by a local

If the corporation was domestic -- and this is

20

where the either-or comes in.

If the corporation was

21

domestic, the shareholder didn't have to pay tax on his

22

stock, but the corporation paid tax, in essence, on all of

23

its stock as if it were paying for the shareholder, and

24

the way that was done was, the corporation paid tax on the

25

greater of the value of the tangible personal property in

1

Indiana that it owned, or the capitalization value of all

2

its market value stock.

3

And therefore, Justice Holmes looked at this

4

situation and said, well, certainly Indiana can tax the

5

stock of residents, and certainly Indiana can make the

6

corporations pay tax on their property, including their

7

capital stock, and we don't see anything wrong with that,

8

and by the way, we're not going to consider the situation

9

where the corporation might own property in Indiana and in

10

other States, because --

Yes, but if they had liabilities, did

they subtract it?

16

MR. CUMMINGS:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. CUMMINGS:

19

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

They subtracted liabilities.
Correct.

So therefore in almost every case the

20

gross -- if there's goodwill in the company, and unless in

21

an unusual circumstance except for that, then the value of

22

the -- the total value of the stock will be greater than

23

the intangible or tangible property -- the tangible

property.

So almost every case, what they're

If we don't look any further than

what Justice Holmes wrote, wouldn't it be simpler to say

10

that what Holmes was, and what the Court was holding in

11

that case was really something about equal protection in

12

judging economic regulation, and the one thing that is

3

clear today is that that is not the standard for dormant

Justice Holmes said, we're not dealing with the case where

2

a foreign corporation owns some Indiana property, and

3

property tax was paid to the State of Indiana but there

4

was no deduction allowed against the shareholders' stock.

5

He said, we're not going to deal with that, because

they're not our facts, and that is the very paradigm case

that I stated at the outset that represents the actual

penalty here, where we can have --

QUESTION:

Well, what did the Court say it was

deciding in Darnell?
MR. CUMMINGS:

11

It said it was deciding, Your

12

Honor, whether a State can tax the property of a domestic

13

corporation, that property including the capital value of

14

its stock, in the stock of a foreign corporation.

QUESTION:

Yes, but it didn't say that in the

abstract.

MR. CUMMINGS:

The citation follow -- well, the

Court said at the outset of the opinion that there had

22

been a claim made under the Fourteenth Amendment and under

the Commerce Clause, but when it got to the last

paragraph, where it discussed the stock tax on in- and

25

out-of-State corporations, it cited the case of Kidd v.

1

Alabama, which was a 1903 decision that was purely under

2

the Fourteenth Amendment.
And Kidd v. Alabama went off on Coe v. Erroll,

3
4

and Coe v. Erroll was one of those early cases which

5

dealt, again, with timber -- they seemed to have a lot of

6

timber in the early days -- and it simply held that the

7

State from which the timber was cut could tax the timber,

8

and then if the timber was shipped across the State line,

9

the State where it was received could tax the timber.

QUESTION:

Well, but that's not equal

14

MR. CUMMINGS:

Yes, Your Honor.

I believe it

was both due process and to some extent equal protection.

15
16

That's due

QUESTION:

Well, did it -- is there any mention

of equal protection in the opinion?

17

MR. CUMMINGS:

There's a mention of "substantial

18

equality."

19

substantial equality is attained by taxing the stock of

20

the foreign corporation and the property of the domestic

21

corporation, and I agree that the Commerce Clause, part of

22

the decision was really not decided by the Court because

23

it did not have the facts before it.

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.

I don't know that we've done that in

5

the cases since I've been sitting here, anyway.

6

to me we look at the tax's overall impact, so no matter

7

how you slice it, you're asking us to cut back on what we

8

said in Darnell.

MR. CUMMINGS:

It seems

Well, I believe -- yes, Your

10

Honor, and I believe a straw has already been put into the

wind on that issue in the Jefferson Lines decision earlier

14

It was the first time that this Court has

Jefferson Lines, the Court was dealing with giving credit

17

or perhaps for a different tax paid by that taxpayer, and

18

this Court said, if a State chooses to have an apportioned

19

gross receipts tax on a bus company, and if it chooses to

20

give a credit for the sales tax paid to that State by the

21

bus rider, then it must give a credit for out-of-State

22

sales taxes paid by bus riders that bought their ticket

F. Darnell, the first cite of Darnell since the 1935

decision in Colgate v. Harvey.

5

I think you were sending us a signal that you

6

saw the inconsistency of Darnell with the credit mechanism

7

set up in footnote 6 in Jefferson Lines, and I say to you

8

that your question about third party is, I think, easily

9

answered, because Darnell is no more a "third party" --

10
11

excuse me.
The corporation in relation to its shareholder

12

is no more a "third party" than is the buyer of the bus

13

ticket a third party in relationship to the bus company.

14

In fact, there is an even closer relationship, because

these are related parties.

shareholder, and if the State chooses to think that

17

there's a close enough relationship that the State can

18

create this sort of intertwining of the corporate tax and

19

the shareholder tax, then certainly this Court can see

20

that there's a close enough relationship to be concerned

21

about the impact on interstate commerce.

We believe --

What tax could a State impose on the

We have no objection to a tax on

MR. CUMMINGS:

if you tax domestic corporations you can put it on evenly,

Are you saying that any tax -- of course,

MR. CUMMINGS:

I would not think so, Your Honor,

well, we will not tax interest earned in the banks of our

other States.

QUESTION:

4
5

The rule would be the same.
Yes, Your Honor, and that issue has

percolated up through the appellate courts.
Justice O'Connor, if you are concerned about the

6

7

repeal, the repeal occurred on April 18 of this year,

8

3 days after the last due date for the filing of the '95

9

returns, and therefore the repeal has not even taken

10

effect yet.
Last week I called three attorney -- three

11
12

accountants and was told of five cases of assessment of

13

this tax that have occurred since the repeal, and

14

therefore this tax is ongoing in the State of North

15

Carolina.

16

The Court has not questioned the compensating

17

tax defense, and I will not dwell on it except to say that

18

it is designed to prevent a preference for interstate

19

commerce.

20

the normal taxing regime somehow misses taxation of

21

interstate commerce.

22

It is designed to address the situation where

Well, here, the normal taxing regime, the

23

compensated tax, according to the decision of the North

24

Carolina supreme court, is the corporate income tax.

25

does the corporate income tax fall on?

It falls on all of

1

the income earned from business in the State of North

2

Carolina.

3

This Court has said many times that's all the

4

State of North Carolina is entitled to tax the corporation

5

upon, and therefore, nothing has been missed.

6

nothing left to be compensated for, and yet the North

7

Carolina supreme court decision did indicate that the

8

stock tax was a proxy for tax on corporate income earned

9

out of State.

10

There's

No doubt realizing the difficulty of this

11

position, the State has developed a new theory on its

12

appeal brief to this Court that somehow there must be a

13

payment for access to capital markets by foreign

14

corporations, and if the foreign corporation is not paying

15

a corporate income tax to the State, then its shareholders

16

must pay a stock tax, which is a proxy tax on the foreign

17

corporation.

18

Getting back to Justice Ginsburg's question, we

19

have no objection to a tax on 100 percent of the value of

20

the foreign corporation's stock, as long as it's also

21

applied to the value of the local corporation's stock.

22

The issue is not really so much the compensating

23

tax defense as the need, as the other shoe that the State

24

has to drop, which is, oh, by the way, we don't just want

25

to tax 100 percent of the value of the stock for access to

capital markets, we want to give this deduction so that we

2

don't have double taxation intrastate, and that is, I

3

believe, the real issue in this case.

4

And that brings us, Justice Souter, back to

5

Jefferson Lines, because I believe Jefferson Lines

6

indicated that a State cannot attempt to avoid intrastate

7

double taxation and at the same time create interstate

8

double taxation and ignore taxes paid to other States.

9

And Justice Rehnquist, this also brings us back

10

to -- Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, this also brings us

11

back to Darnell, because in Darnell Mr. Justice Holmes

12

said, we need not, or the State of Indiana need not

13

concern itself with the taxes paid by the corporation to

14

other States.

15

That can just simply be irrelevant.

Well, we know that the more modern Commerce

16

Clause jurisprudence of this Court indicates that a State

17

must concern itself with taxes paid to other States, and

18

that was mentioned in Armco v. Hardesty, where the

19

decision said, this out-of-State manufacturer who is

20

paying the local wholesaling tax undoubtedly is paying an

21

out-of-State manufacturing tax, or may be paying an out-

22

of-State manufacturing tax and therefore it is subject to

23

dual taxation, whereas the manufacturer who sells at home

24

only pays one tax.

25

Now, there might be some question of whether
23

1

other States have manufacturing taxes.

Frankly, we don't

2

have one in the State of North Carolina, but there's not

3

much question that almost every State in these 50 States

4

has a corporate income tax, so with respect -- so

5

regardless of how many States have stock taxes, every

6

State has a corporate income tax, and therefore to the

7

extent other States are collecting corporate income taxes

8

on multi-state corporations, when their stock is held in

9

North Carolina there will be double taxation, whereas if

10

the stock is owned by the local corporation, and more

11

importantly if the local corporation just keeps its

12

business at home, only one tax is paid.

13

If there are no further questions, thank you.

14

QUESTION:

15

Mr. Rothfeld, we'll hear from you.

1

2

that sort of thing?

3

MR. ROTHFELD:

My understanding, Your Honor, is

4

that there is a list of stocks that's maintained by the

5

State, and he can determine that simply by looking to that

6

list to determine which percentage of the stock is

7

taxable, so I think it's a fairly routine and easy

8

mechanical matter.

9

I should say, I think that this case involves

10

two distinct Commerce Clause principles.

11

principle of nondiscrimination, which we think in this

12

case turns on application of the compensatory tax

13

doctrine.

14

The first is the

The second distinct principle is the principle

15

of apportionment, which we think in this case turns on the

16

application of the internal consistency test, and I think

17

it's useful to keep these principles straight, and I'll

18

discuss them separately, starting with the question of

19

discrimination, and on that question, given some of the

20

discussion thus far, I think it's useful to begin with

21

what the State understood the relationship to be between

22

the income tax and the shares tax at the time that it

23

enacted the taxable percentage deduction that's at issue

24

in this case.

been observed, the taxable percentage deduction and,

indeed, the entire intangibles tax, have been repealed.

Why don't you slow down a little bit,

Mr. Rothfeld.
MR. ROTHFELD:

Oh, I'm sorry.

to get to the meat of the case, Your Honor, that I'm

8

speeding along.
Before the State enacted the taxable percentage

10

deduction it entirely excluded corporate shares from the

11

reach of the intangibles tax, and when the State began to

12

consider an expansion revision of the intangibles tax, it

13

was of the view that intangibles were simply paper

14

representations of other values that might already be

15

subjected to other State taxes, and in particular, that

16

corporate shares were representations of other corporate

17

values that might be subjected to the State property tax

18

or income tax, and when the State determined to expand the

19

intangibles tax to reach corporate shares, it decided to

20

try to avoid duplicative taxation of these related

21

intrastate values.

22

Now, the State considered but rejected the idea

23

of a discriminatory tax that would exempt the shares of

24

domestic while taxing the shares of foreign corporations,

25

and instead hit upon the idea of the taxable percentage

QUESTION:

I -- you're saying that the ones that

do business in North Carolina pay an income tax to North

Carolina, and what you're trying to do is make up for the

MR. ROTHFELD:

QUESTION:

And the problem that I have with that

is not the technical thing, it's just the practical thing.

Of course North Carolina loses the income tax of a

do they lose a lot of things.

buy whiskey in North Carolina?

22

MR. ROTHFELD:

What's the difference?

I think the difference, Your

Honor, is that there is something in the State that's

taxable, and that's the corporate shares, and the

corporate shares represent something.

are various ways that one could look at what those shares

represent.
In Darnell, we think that the State looked at

I

think that -QUESTION:

You're saying the intangible stock is

in effect a surrogate for income, and therefore the two

5

may be considered in relation to each other in determining

6

what I should tax, and if, in fact, there is this

surrogate relationship, and you are justified in taxing

8

the one, you would be justified, I suppose, in taxing

9

100 percent of the income even though 80 percent of it was

10
11

earned out of the State.
MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, we certainly recognize that

12

the State can't tax 100 percent of the income, or any of

13

the income which is earned outside of the State, unless

14

the State has apportionable taxing nexus to it, and we're

not trying to tax the income.

What we're suggesting is that under the

compensatory tax doctrine, related values that are present

in the State and out of State may be subject to tax, and I

19

think it's important, Your Honor, not to confuse the

20

apportionment principle which relates to credits for taxes

21

paid elsewhere and the nondiscrimination principle, which

22

relates to whether or not the taxable percentage deduction

23

should be viewed is that there is one -- there are

substantially related values, and that is the test the

2

Court has articulated in the compensatory tax doctrine

3

cases, that there are substantially related values between

4

the value of corporate shares and the amount of corporate

5

income as a matter of economic reality, and we think given

6

that substantial relationship, imposing a tax, a tax as a

7

mutually exclusive proxy either on income, if income is

8

taxable, or on the corporate shares which represent those

9

values, that that does not impose a discrimination.

10

Now, the question of whether or not we're taxing

11

too much total value, whether the tax is on apportionment,

12

is a separate internal consistency question which I'll get

instruction, and so despite the prior steps that went in

2

the taxpayer's favor, at the bottom line, Darnell is the

3

Supreme Court's instruction and so we follow it.

4

6

But as I understand the Kentucky supreme court,
it rejected the argument that you have been making so far.
MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I'm not sure that I agree

7

with everything in the opinion of the Kentucky supreme

8

court in that case, although the Kentucky tax was a

9

different tax than this tax.

The Kentucky tax was a

10

property tax which actually differed even from the

11

property tax in Darnell, in that as I understand the

12

Kentucky system, if a corporation paid tax on 75 percent

13

of its property to Kentucky, then there would be an

14

automatic complete deduction in taxability of the shares,

15

which is not the system we have here.

16

But insofar as the Kentucky court was saying

17

that the kind of system we have here is discriminatory and

18

is not saved by the compensatory tax doctrine, which we

19

disagree with that analysis, as I say, first of all we

20

think that the Court addressed precisely this problem in

21

Darnell, which we don't find cryptic, and I think looking

22

at what Justice Holmes said for a unanimous Court, and

23

looking at the arguments that were made to the Court in

24

Darnell, the argument was precisely the argument that's

25

being made here, that there was a discrimination in the

treatment of the corporate shares.
QUESTION:

2

3

I do find it cryptic, so maybe you

can explain it to me.

4

MR. ROTHFELD:

As I understand it, and perhaps

5

I'm missing the crypticism there, but as I understand it,

6

what was happening in Darnell was that there was a tax on

7

real and tangible property that was imposed on

8

corporations, and there was an intangibles tax imposed on
the value of all corporate shares in the State, and

10

insofar as the State paid intangible -- insofar as the

11

corporation paid tax on its tangible and personal property

12

in the State, then the taxpayer was relieved, the

13

individual shareholder was relieved of paying a shares

14

tax, just as there is relief here for the individual

15

shareholder if the corporation pays income tax.

16

And the Court, looking at this scheme, said that

17

a tax on the property of a domestic corporation -- and

18

this was the Court's language -- a tax on the property of

1

a domestic corporation and on the shares of a foreign one

20

is consistent with substantial equality, and that's

21

precisely what we're saying here, that there are related

22

values that are being taxed in precise proportion to one

23

another.

Well, why are they any more related

than whiskey is related?

but it just seems to me that the reason that you don't

have an income tax on California companies in North

3

Carolina is because the California companies don't have

income in North Carolina.

5

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think the best I can

6

do -- perhaps I can't satisfy you completely, Your Honor,

7

but the best I can do is that the share is a

representation of something else.

QUESTION:

10

It's a representation

It's a discounted value of a future

11

income stream, and some of that income stream will be

taxed when it reaches a North Carolina person, and the

13

other is taxed in the form of an income tax.

You don't have to -- so --

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think --

Well, and our analysis is that

21

taxing both the representation of the income stream and

22

taxing the income stream is in a sense a kind of

duplicative taxation, and -- because one is a

representation of the value, the other is the value

itself.

QUESTION:

So Darnell must be wrong.

13

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think this case is a

stronger case for the State than Darnell, because as you

say, clearly investors understand shares as representing a

portion of income.

think that -- Darnell makes our case a fortiori if Darnell

directly on point, and I think it's useful, Your Honor, to

15

contrast this case with the Oregon Waste Systems decision

16

from 2 years ago, which I think is very instructive on how

17

to analyze this.

18

The Oregon Waste Systems case, Oregon argued

19

that its discriminatory tax on disposal of waste at Oregon

20

landfills and its income tax were substantially related

21

and that the taxes were compensatory, and the Court

22

rejected that argument because it found that disposal of

23

waste at an Oregon landfill and earning income are not

24

substantially related, and to prove that point, the Court

25

found it decisive that an Oregon firm that disposed of

1

waste in an Oregon landfill would be subject both to the

2

income tax and to the discriminatory landfill fee, meaning

3

that the case -- that the taxes were not mutually

4

exclusive proxies for each other.

5

Now, I mean, here, I think that the test --

QUESTION:

I know, and these are

substantially -- because you said here what is going on is

8

basically a tax on access to capital markets, is that --

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think that -- that should

10

not be misleading here, Your Honor.

11

taxes is a tax on access to capital markets as such.

12

income tax is a tax on the earning of income in the State,

13

and it's justified by the benefits that the State provides

14

to corporations that earn income there, and the shares tax

15

is a tax on the ownership of property, intangible property

16

in North Carolina, and the taxpayer here is a North

So I should ignore all the stuff

19

about access to capital markets.

20

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, we make that point, Your

21

Honor, simply because, in response to the taxpayer's

22

argument here that the effect of this tax is to burden

23

out-of-State corporations in their issuing of shares, and

24

that somehow that's unfair because those corporations get

25

no benefit from North Carolina.

In fact, we think they derive substantial

1

2

benefits from services provided by North Carolina which

3

allow those firms to sell to residents who have

4

accumulated capital and to engage in transactions with

5

these out-of-State firms, so we don't justify these taxes

6

because each tax is imposed in precisely the same way on

7

access to capital markets.
We justify these taxes because, and perhaps my

9

exchange with Justice Breyer was unsatisfactory, but we

10

justify these taxes because we view, as we think the Court

11

did in Darnell, corporate shares as being representation

of other values, and those values may be equivalent.

may be substantially similar within the meaning of the --

We have not made that argument.

5

We have argued on the assumption that there is a

discrimination within the meaning of the Court's cases,

7

that there is a compensatory tax that overcomes that

discrimination.

9

I think one should look to the three parts of

10

the compensatory tax test that the Court has identified.

11

It has asked that the taxpayer -- that the State identify

12

the intrastate tax burden for which it is trying to

compensate.

It has asked that the taxes be shown to be a

Can I ask you a question about your

If you want to finish -- are you

finished?
MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think that the outcome

12

would be different here.

13

there, we think that because this is a tax on intangible

14

property, there's a different outcome here.

15

Even if a credit is necessary

The reason that the credit is required, if it is

16

required in that situation, is the apportionment

17

requirement, not the nondiscrimination requirement of the

18

Commerce Clause.

19

It's an internal consistency problem, and

20

apportionment and internal consistency go to the question

21

of whether the State is taking more than its fair share of

22

the value from any one transaction, more than its fair

23

share of any tax value, and the Court has said in

24

Jefferson Lines that a failure of internal consistency

25

is -- as a general matter shows that one State is taking

2

more than its fair share.
That's the problem generally with duplicative

3

taxation, that two States are taxing the same thing, each

4

taking 100 percent of the value, which might be the

5

situation you hypothesized, the sales and use tax.

6

we assume that one State is taking -- or perhaps both

7

States are taking more than their fair share.

8

Then

But the Court has said that principle does not

9

apply to the taxation of intangible property, and while

10

with income one can see where the inputs that go to the

11

creation of income are located and apportion taxing

12

authority over that income accordingly, one can see where

13

tangible property is located and can assign taxing

14

authority to the States of that location, the Court has

15

said, and I'm here quoting from the Court's opinion in

16

Curry v. McCanless which was written by Justice Stone, and

17

it's very closely associated with that element of the

18

Court's modern due process doctrine -- or modern Commerce

19

Clause doctrine.

20

The Court has said that very different

21

consideration is both theoretical and practical applied in

22

the taxation of intangible property, and that is because

23

it is impossible to identify a single location for

something that has no physical characteristics and that is

2

But how can you rely on that kind of

3

an analysis when in your earlier breath you stood here and

4

told us that the State's theory in effect is that this

5

intangible is, in fact, a surrogate, and for purposes of

6

Commerce Clause analysis somehow can be identified with

7

the income of the corporations?
If we accept that analysis, then we, I suppose,

8

9

should not give any kind of special status to the taxation

10

of the intangible here, and if we accept that analysis, it

11

seems to me that backs you right into the internal

12

inconsistency, because on that analysis, if all States

enact the same tax there's going to be more than

substantially related values are reached by two taxes, the

constitutionality of the tax, and indeed the

apportionability of the tax, may turn on the form in which

the tax is pleased, the legal incidence of the tax, the

nature of the tax --

QUESTION:

Well, if the form is going to govern,

then it seems to me you've got a different problem, and

that is the problem of compensatory taxation, supposedly,

1

tax on the seller, whereas the legal incidence of the use

2

tax is invariably on the buyer, so in that situation you

3

have different categories of taxpayers, and the very first

4

of the Court's compensatory tax cases, Hinson v. Lott,

5

involved a tax on -- one tax on distillers, another tax on

6

distributors and dealers in liquor, so there are different

7

categories who can be subject to the tax.

8

9

I think -- I mean, the way that the Court has
described the compensatory tax doctrine has not required

10

precise equivalents on every aspect of the tax, has not

11

required that the taxes be graphed and all the peaks and

12

valleys match exactly, as long as the ultimate burden on

13

interstate and intrastate commerce match up.

14

And indeed, the way the Court has described the

15

compensatory tax doctrine in the Oregon Wastes Systems

16

case is that the taxes must be substantially similar, not

17

that they must be identical, which mirrors the language

18

very closely in the Darnell case upon which we rely that

Alaska Maid was not a

4

Darnell was a case that precedes

5

modern compensatory taxation analysis, so that the

6

question is, do we subsume Darnell under the modern law,

7

that Darnell was not applying anything like the modern

8

law, was it?
MR. ROTHFELD:

9

Well, I think that it was, Your

10

Honor.

11

Lott, the case that this Court cited in Oregon Waste

12

Systems decision as the genesis of the compensatory tax

13

doctrine, long preceded Darnell, and the language the

14

Court used in Darnell is similar, substantially similar to

15

the language that it uses in the Oregon Waste Systems

16

case, so there's no reason to think the Court was applying

17

different standards.

18

I think that -- as I say, the Court in Hinson v.

In any event, in Oregon Waste Systems, the

19

Court's most recent decision, it referred -- has used the

20

language of substantial similarity, and not precision.

21

I think the point of the doctrine is not a

22

formalism that's designed to match up the taxes, as I say,

at every point.

But to return to the question of apportionment,

and in terms of consistency, which I think is a crucial

question here, and whether or not this should be treated

as an intangible property tax and an income tax, the fact

is, this is an intangible property tax.
As in Jefferson Lines, the fact that the tax is

apportionable, and if -- look at it this way.

11

taxpayer's complaint here, ultimately, on the

12

apportionment part of the argument, is that its values are

13

being subjected, or could be subjected to duplicative

14

taxation in other States.

15

The

If we're right about the treatment of intangible

16

property, and we think that the Court's holding on that

are absolutely clear, then if this precise tax, this

18

precise shares tax on 100 percent of the value, were

19

replicated in some other State, he would have no

complaint.

of that duplicative taxation.

22

The taxpayer would have no complaint because

complaint than he has now, and I think Jefferson Lines is
3

very good authority on that point, that one looks to the

4

nature of the taxes being challenged.

5

Even though the economic effect of the tax,

economic reality of the tax may be similar to a tax that

has to be apportioned, the fact that the tax is put in

forms that does not require apportionment should be

dispositive.

So I think ultimately for the Court to rule for

the taxpayer in this case, it clearly would have to

12

overrule Darnell v. Indiana, which we think is clearly on

point, it would have to set aside the precedents holding

14

that duplicative taxation of intangible property is

15

permissible.

16

It would also, we think, have to cut back on the

17

principle and say intrastate commerce can be made to pay

18

its own way and need not be placed in a favored position,

19

because if the taxpayer's position here prevails, the

20

State will have to either impose duplicative taxation of

21

intrastate commerce, which is clearly, as an historical

22

matter, what it was trying to avoid, or it will have to

23

abandon any taxation of intangibles altogether, which

24

means it will have to give up the chance to tax values

There is no reason for the Court to take such a

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH L. CUMMINGS, JR.

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. CUMMINGS:

If this Court finds for Fulton

Corporation, I would request that the Court in its
decision give some indication of the application of its

Sty

15
16

decision to the 1990 tax year issue.
The reason for my concern is that the only

17

decision we have below, which was a decision of the North

18

Carolina court of appeals, which ruled for Fulton

19

Corporation and found the tax to be unconstitutional,

20

postponed the effective date of its decision for a year-

21

and-a-half after the date of the decision, and therefore

22

Fulton Corporation received no remedy.

23

We moved before that court for rehearing on the

24

basis of this Court's decision in Harper v. Virginia,

25

which expressed a very strong desire for -51

Yes, but is it not clear that they

have an alternative, either doing away with the exemption
