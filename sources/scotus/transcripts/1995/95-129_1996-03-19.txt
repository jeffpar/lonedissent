ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHIRLEY M. HUFSTEDLER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
Exxon's tanker would never have stranded but for

12

respondent's torts and breaches of warranty.

13

presented is whether these respondents should be totally

14

absolved of all liability because the district court found

15

that the tanker captain's navigation of the stricken

16

vessel was grossly negligent.

17

The answer to that question is no.

The question

The lower

18

courts reached the opposite conclusion by failing to apply

19

the comparative fault principles established by this Court

20

in Reliable Transfer and its progeny by misconceiving and

21

misapplying the common-law doctrine of superseding cause.

22

QUESTION:

You take the district court to task

23

for having considered causation first and damages second,

24

although it never got to damages.

25

it would have been strange to do anything else.

I should have thought

You must

1

have causation, mustn't you, before you inquire about

2

damages and, of course, that leads to the next question,

3

do you -- you're not telling us, I take it, that but-for

4

causation suffices?
MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

5

Not suffices but, but for that

6

issue, you'd never reach the question whether there's any

7

superseding cause, because superseding cause, if it

8

applies at all in admiralty since Reliable Transfer,

9

necessarily assumes, as the district court concluded, that

10

there had been actual cause, or you'd never reach

11

superseding cause.

12

which is a limitation of liability, and it's not causation

13

at all.

14

You don't reach superseding cause,

It's a question of fault.
QUESTION:

Well, but you must have, before you

15

proceed to the question of damages, that legal cause, that

16

cause which admiralty courts will recognize as sufficient

17

to impose liability on the tortfeasor --

18

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

19

QUESTION:

Of course.

And I'm asking how you define that,

20

other than but-for causation, because I take it it's

21

something more.

22

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

In admiralty, as in common

23

law, you have to have but-for causation and legal cause.

24

I do not suggest for a moment that an admiralty claimant

25

need not prove both.

1

The difficulty here is that the foreclosure

2

orders of the district court prevented Exxon from ever

3

proving its liability case-in-chief to prove that there

4

was legal cause as well as but-for cause, and you never

5

got to the issue of damages because you never finished

6

proving liability.

7

All of Exxon's evidence with respect to

8

everything that happened before the equipment failed was

9

foreclosed by the district court.

It wasn't a question of

10

order of proof.

It was the question of entering judgment

11

before the liability case-in-chief was proved.

12

QUESTION:

But Ms. --

QUESTION:

Well --

14

QUESTION:

Well --

15

QUESTION:

-- if the district court had found

16

out that some pirates had come, obviously unforeseen

17

cause, I suppose he wouldn't have proceeded to any of

18

those questions either.

19

wrongly as a matter of fact, but I think correctly as a

20

matter of law, that he was going to first inquire whether

21

or not the negligence of the Captain's tanker was a

22

supervening cause of this extraordinary proportion, and

23

you weren't foreclosed in producing any evidence on that

24

issue, were you?

25

And he was saying, rightly or

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

Yes, because the Captain was

1

reacting to a series of hazards that were created prior to

2

the time the equipment failed.

3

proving anything that happened before that, and even under

4

common-law doctrine, no one can prove there is a

5

superseding cause or that there is not unless there is

6

first proved what the duties are with respect to each of

7

the defendant's acts on the basis of their relationship

8

with each other, and how those breaches of duties created

9

the risks of harm, and until those facts are proved, there

Exxon was foreclosed from

10

is no way in which a court can decide whether there has

11

been superseding cause.

12

QUESTION:

Ms. Hufstedler, I don't read your --

13

the questions presented in your petitioner to raise any

14

question about the ordering of the trial.

15

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

QUESTION:

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

18

QUESTION:

19

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

20

QUESTION:

Oh, of course not.

It raises just questions of law -Sure.

-- about what governs admiralty.
That's correct.

Ms. Hufstedler, as I understand the

21

district court's findings, the findings were that, at a

22

certain point, I think about 90 minutes after the

23

difficulties began, the tanker reached a point of safety.

24
25

It was -- according to the district court as I
understand it, it was out of whatever danger had been

1

created by the negligent acts of the defendants, and the

2

finding was from that point on the causation for the

3

ultimate grounding and the harm that resulted was entirely

4

attributable to the navigational errors, errors of

5

judgment on the part of the tanker's captain.

6

Do you claim that there is an error of law in

7

what I understand to be the finding that the tanker had

8

reached this zone of safety after which the prior

9

negligence of the defendant simply was not operative?

10

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

Justice Souter, the response

11

is that the Court's conclusions of law cannot be

12

reconciled with its other findings of fact.

13

findings --

14

QUESTION:

The other

Well, I'm asking just a question

15

of -- well, I asked whether there was an error of law.

16

I'm really asking, I guess, whether you claim that there

17

is such a want of evidentiary basis for the finding about

18

reaching the zone of safety that it was, in fact, a legal

19

error to conclude that.

20

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

Yes.

21

QUESTION:

How do we know whether you're

Okay.

22

right or wrong?

23

that there was no evidentiary basis to reach that

24

conclusion?

25

Tell me what your basis is for saying

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

I say there's no evidentiary

1

basis because the facts as found by the court on

2

uncontradicted evidence was that the trailing hose caused

3

the crane to collapse after the point at which the vessel

4

was supposed to be safe, that the hose and the collapse of

5

the crane caused the boom of the crane to sweep the decks,

6

which threatened the vessel's life by explosion and

7

threatened the lives of all the deck crew.

8

9

That was a direct result of the breaking of the
chafe chain, of the breakage of the hose, of the lack of

10

any safety equipment on the cargo hose, of the lack of any

11

safety equipment - -

12

QUESTION:

I think I know the train you're

13

following, but I take it, then, in order to rule your way

14

we would have to find that the -- I guess the second of

15

the conclusions of law is simply unsupportable, and that's

16

the conclusion that such conduct -- that is, of your

17

captain -- was a superseding cause, and the sole proximate

18

cause of the stranding.

19

We would have to reject particularly that

20

finding that it was the sole proximate cause, wouldn't we,

21

in order to hold your way?

22

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

Yes, and I think the Court,

23

unless it is going to retreat from decisions long embedded

24

in the law, would have to say that that's incorrect,

25

because you cannot decide, even under common law, whether

QUESTION:

Or you could simply assume that -Yes, you --

-- and say, on that assumption,

nonetheless, superseding cause.
QUESTION:

Well, on any factual question, Ms. --

10

we have a two-court rule which we usually follow.

The

11

district court found against you and the court of appeals

12

affirmed, so that anything that is a factual question I

13

don't think we ordinarily reexamine.

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

I don't suggest you reexamine

matter of law, you cannot determine whether there has been

What I suggest is that you look at the

QUESTION:

That's a

Ms. Hufstedler, my problem is this,

22

i didn't think we took this case, even if we're able to --

23

even if the two-court rule does not apply, to make

24

essentially factual determinations and say that, you know,

25

the factual findings of the court below were wrong, or

1

even that the findings of law were wrong, except in one

2

regard.
I thought we were going to decide whether the

3
4

doctrine of supervening cause applies, not whether, if it

5

applies, it was properly imposed by the court here, and

6

you're turning us into an examination of whether that

7

doctrine has been properly applied here.

8

read your question presented.
MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

9

That's not how I

You only reach the question

10

you have suggested I presented if you get past the first

11

point.

12

right, that after Reliable Transfer, that the superseding

13

cause doctrine as it was applied sometimes in admiralty

14

cases below, is no longer applicable.

15

I believe that the Eleventh Circuit is entirely

QUESTION:

Ms. Hufstedler, on that point, it was

16

pointed out by the respondent that many States, in fact

17

most, now have comparative negligence systems, and in none

18

of those has the supervening cause doctrine been declared

19

incompatible.

20

couple have considered it and said they're compatible.

21

Some have not considered it.

Some --a

My question is, is there any State with a

22

comparative negligence regime that has said, now

23

supervening cause is no longer valid because it conflicts

24

with the notion of comparative negligence?

25

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

I am unaware of any.

1

QUESTION:

How could it be that there wouldn't

2

be a supervening cause doctrine?

3

had been floating around because of the negligence of the

4

defendant, and it ran into a leftover World War II

5

submarine that torpedoed it?

6

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

7

QUESTION:

Suppose that the ship

I mean -But Justice Breyer --

I mean, suppose the most fantastic

8

coincidence, struck by lightning, suppose that -- I mean,

9

we can imagine any bizarre set of circumstance we want.

10
11

That would cut the causal chain, wouldn't it?
I mean, what has comparative negligence to do

12

with that, some amazing coincidence, some odd circumstance

13

that cuts the causal chain and in and of itself is the

14

cause of the accident, the original negligence being

15

simply a but-for condition that happened to place the ship

16

in the particular part of the sea where the enemy

17

submarine was lurking, or the lightning struck?

18

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

Justice Breyer, surely the

19

admiralty defendant would not be responsible for whatever

20

the results were in your illustration --

21

QUESTION:

Well, if that's so, how --

22

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

However, there is no reason

23

why the admiralty defendant that has breached a duty and

24

created a risk of some kind of harm should not be

25

responsible for whatever portion of that damage was

1

attributable to the acts before.
QUESTION:

2

But then the judge says zero portion,

3

because there was a supervening cause, just like the

4

submarine which would have torpedoed the ship, or the

5

submarine that would have led to evasive action and an

6

eventual stranding of the ship.

7

In this case the ship had come to rest, it was

8

safe, there was no problem, and it was the Captain,

9

himself, who then caused the trouble because of the

10

Captain's failure to keep any chart, because of his

11

failure to let the anchor down, because of his properly --

12

because of failure, et cetera, et cetera, and he's listed

13

about five.

14

I mean, once you say there could be some

15

supervening cause, then how do you distinguish your case

16

here?

17

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

Well, as I read your own

18

authorities, both with -- and we're now talking only about

19

the tort claims.

20

warranty claims, but talking only about the tort claims --

21

there must be - - before one can say that a cause has

22

superseded, one must examine what the hazards were that

23

were created in the first place, as Restatement Black

24

Letter 442 states, that the cause is always proximate if

25

what happened was within the risk that was created by the

It doesn't go to the breach of the

1

original misconduct and if there was a - - or was also a

2

contributing factor to that.

3

The only time you get a cause broken is in the

4

illustrations that you just gave, where there is conduct

5

of a third person that is either criminal or intentionally

6

tortious.

7

Then the chain of causation is broken.
QUESTION:

So when you use superseding cause

8

here, and you say it should not be recognized, are you

9

talking about superseding cause as a cause attributed to

10

the plaintiff, as distinct from the third party?

11

We have a terminological problem --

12

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- because 442, which you quote, says

14

superseding cause by definition is only that which is set

15

in play by a third party or a third force, and I take it

16

we don't have that here.

17

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

18

QUESTION:

19

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

That's exactly right.

Okay.
That's why the doctrine

20

doesn't apply at all, even if you assume that common-law

21

superseding cause survived the adoption of the --

22

QUESTION:

All right.

Are we just talking,

23

then, about labels, because let's assume we say,

24

superseding cause is a third party or a third force

25

phenomenon.

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

2

QUESTION:

3

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

4

QUESTION:

Yes.

We don't have that here.
That's right.

However, it is findable in any

5

comparative negligence case, I suppose, that a point is

6

reached at which the defendant's original causation should

7

no longer be recognized by the law, because it has become

8

attenuated and so on, and in place of it the plaintiff's

9

negligence is so overwhelmingly the cause that we should

10
11

recognize that as proximate cause only.
Now, I take it you do not claim that that kind

12

of analysis is somehow precluded by the comparative

13

negligence doctrine.

14

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

It is not that it can never

15

happen where there has been a third person that has

16

intervened.

17
18

QUESTION:

Well, no, let's assume there's no

third person, as, indeed --

19

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

20

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- is true here, no third party.

21

Isn't it true, consistently with comparative negligence,

22

that if the facts warranted a court or jury could conclude

23

that the defendant's cause was no longer proximate,

24

although the defendant had, in a but-for sense, set things

25

in motion, and that the only proximate cause operative at

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

I mean,

1

negligence in berthing gives rise to a risk of stranding

2

on some distant reef, and why can't you say -- by the way,

3

I'm not sure I agree that there's no supervening cause.

4

I'm not sure that cause is the negligence.

5

I mean, the immediate cause is the darned reef

6

which is -- which destroys the ship, and can't you say

7

that that cause is a supervening cause, apart from the

8

negligence of the berthing?

9

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

I would say no, because

10

stranding, no matter how it's stranded, was within the

11

exact risks that were created by the respondent's torts.

12

QUESTION:

But my problem, Mrs. Hufstedler, is

13

that your answers to Justice Breyer, Justice Souter,

14

Justice Ginsburg, Justice Scalia, all are discussions

15

within the regime of comparative negligence, and I think

16

you concede that there's supervening cause.

17

I don't want to put words in your mouth.

I

18

think -- but you've presented this as an admiralty case

19

where the rules somehow should be different.

20

thought, the gravamen of the question presented, and I

21

don't see why the rule should be different, and it seems

22

to me that you don't, either, because we've been

23

discussing this in the regime of any comparative

24

negligence system, admiralty or not.

merits of your suggestion we apply a different test to the

5

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

I have not seen a case in

6

which the common-law doctrine of superseding cause has

7

been applied to relieve a defendant in an admiralty case,

8

or, indeed, another, of liability for breach of warranty,

9

although, of course, it does go to the question of how

10
11

much damages should be allowed.
QUESTION:

Well, if you're talking about

12

basically a contract action, you've got the idea of

13

contemplated damages that has the same sort of limiting

14

principles, doesn't it, as the idea of supervening cause?

15

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

It does.

What -- however, I

16

think the question, Mr. Chief Justice, is - - I would put

17

somewhat differently.

That is, in a breach of admiralty warranty case,

Not any stranding.

7

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

8

QUESTION:

Not any --

Not a stranding 15 years later in

10

within the contemplation, given the enormously negligent,

grossly negligent, or however we call it, activity of the

12

Captain.

13

same question as the other.

14

I mean, and that seems to me to boil down to the

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

Why not?
There's no question whatever

15

that the vessel would have been nowhere near the reef upon

16

which she stranded but for the undisputed fact, as found

17

by the district court, that this vessel was burdened with

18

this enormous cargo hose that continued to be a danger to

19

that vessel until 12 minutes before the turn.

20

QUESTION:

But that's a factual -- I mean, I

21

think you may have a good point there, but that goes to

22

the apparent inconsistency between the finding that the

23

negligence had terminated and that finding that the hose,

up until half-an-hour before the grounding was still

giving difficulty.

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

And I would, and I do take the

position that it should not apply.

11

because to apply it under circumstances in this case means

12

that you reach results that are antithetical with the

QUESTION:

Let's examine in principle why -- I

10

MRS. HUFSTEDLER:

The only reason I would

respond it is not appropriate, Justice Ginsburg, is that

12

common law, superseding cause included, is made in 50

States by multiple courts that do not agree with each

I don't see a second tort here. I see an initial

tort, arguably the parting of the chain, followed by a

failure to mitigate, or a failure to take avoidable

consequences of damages which might get you where you want

to go, but I'm not sure that it's superseding or

MR. PLAYDON:

Let me then perhaps argue from a

different perspective, Justice Kennedy.

envisioned by the breakout from the mooring at 28 minutes

aground in the vicinity of the mooring.

that was envisioned if, in fact, the breakout was a cause.

MR. PLAYDON:

3

QUESTION:

Yes.

Now, supposing the trial judge said

4

well, why did he make these navigational errors?

5

reason, presumably -- he might have made a finding, one

6

reason was that he was still concerned about the hose that

7

was trailing along the vessel.

8

that caused him to only give 90 percent attention to

navigation where he should have given 100 percent

attention.
If that was one of the facts that caused him to

navigate improperly, why would that not have been

inconsistent with the view that his -- that one side is

14

entirely responsible for the accident?
MR. PLAYDON:

MR. PLAYDON:

Well, remember that Judge Fong, he

sort of gave us a safety valve when he said look, if I've

8

made findings of fact that are really conclusions, they

9

should be held to be conclusions, and if I made

10

conclusions that are really findings, then they should be

deemed by findings, and that's what we're saying.

factfinding that this Court, I think under the two-court

rule referred to by Justice -- Chief Justice Rehnquist is

one that they're bound to adhere to.

the kind of question if you had a judge-jury you would

MR. PLAYDON:

Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg, and

in this particular case Judge Fong was both the judge and
the jury in this case.
QUESTION:

11

But going back to Justice Stevens'

12

question, doesn't that underscore the impropriety of

13

splitting this trial?

14

there really was a break in this negligence on the part of

15

the defendants, one would have to have the whole scene

played out.

17

MR. PLAYDON:

That is, in order to determine if

I would respectfully disagree,

18

Justice Ginsburg.

Let me indicate that perhaps we might

19

take some note of the Union Oil v. SAN JACINTO case, where

20

3 years before Reliable Transfer this Court took that case

21

thinking, my, this may be the case to deal with divided

22

damages.

23

And then the Court took a look at it and said,

25

addressing the issue of liability before we address the

1

question of damage, and when it went through the analysis

2

it found that there really wasn't two causes of this

3

particular incident on the Columbia River, that really

4

there was only one person at fault, and that was the tug

5

coming out of a fog bank at right angles and striking the

6

SAN JAC -- excuse me, the SANTA MARIA as it was proceeding

7

up past Portland.
And that certainly would say that the inquiry

8

9

done by Judge Fong is not only appropriate but an

10

essential part, and it's clearly within his mandate of

11

Rule 42(b), which gives the trial court sound discretion

12

to be able to structure a case so that it can be

13

conserving of its time and resources, recalling that this

14

particular case took 3 weeks of the court's time, bench

15

time, just to try the issue of causation.

16

So surely that tort of examination would

17

indicate that Exxon over those 3 weeks had an abundant

18

opportunity to be heard on all of the issues and to

19

present all of the proof that it could on the issue of

You know, the one that comes to

It was cited in the corespondent's brief, and

11

that's the PALUDINA case which occurred in 1927, in a case

12

where they had an initial breakout, then hit another

13

vessel that hit a third vessel, and then the vessels were

14

separated for a period of time, and then the SARA struck

15

another vessel and they tried to bring in the original

16

vessel, the PALUDINA.

17

And basically the English court said, now, wait

18

a minute, whatever was started by the PALUDINA had long

since passed before the ultimate harm.

QUESTION:

I'm not sure that you need a doctrine

12

MR. PLAYDON:

-- of arguing Pfalzgraf.

Obviously, Pfalzgraf is a

13

foreseeability doctrine, just like Hadley v. Baxendale is

14

a foreseeability problem.

15

I think that the supervening cause gives us a

16

set of sort of workable parameters within which we can

17

work this doctrine as opposed to having it exist as merely

18

a name, or a title.

There was

this other cause, because basically it was beyond the

scope of the risk that you created.

3

MR. PLAYDON:

QUESTION:

Sure.

And I can call that other cause, if I

want, a supervening cause, and I guess that makes

everything sound nicer, but I don't know that it's any

different.
MR. PLAYDON:

It probably may not.

It may be a

distinction without a difference, Justice Scalia.
I think what happened, you know, in practicality

10
11

is that when the trial court, when Judge Fong was

12

presented with just the facts, or the basic facts of what

13

was occurring, that the grounding -- excuse me, the

14

stranding that occurs 3 hours later at a remote distance

15

around Barbers Point, that that just in and of itself

cried out for a proceeding that examined causation.

when he examined that causation, it was clearly that the

operative events of the breakout simply had no bearing on

But thereafter he then, at about 1803 the little
