ORAL ARGUMENT OF EVAN T. LAWSON

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LAWSON:

10
11
12

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
Price advertizing has always been at the heart

13

of the commercial speech doctrine.

14

Court's concern for the free flow of price information

15

that prompted the Court about 20 years ago to overturn the

16

concept that commercial speech had no First Amendment

17

protection and to accord particularly price advertizing

18

protection under the First Amendment.

19

Indeed, it was the

Since that time, the jurisprudence of the Court

20

has developed, and the Central Hudson test has become

21

established and refined.

22

Hudson test to this case would yield the result that Rhode

23

Island's ban on truthful price advertizing should be found

24

unconstitutional.

25

Application of the Central

Ordinarily, the Central Hudson test seems to be

1

discussed in a sequential fashion, but I would like to

2

turn to the last part of the Central Hudson test, because

3

I think that it is under that part that the defect of this

4

ban is the most clearly apparent.

5

The last part of the Central Hudson test

6

requires that the State's restriction on speech be no more

7

expansive than is necessary.

8

it, that means that the restriction not burden speech any

9

more than is necessary.

10

As this Court has posited

In this particular case, it is clear on the

11

record both from the testimony of the State's own expert,

12

and from the obvious facts of the case that are not

13

disputed, that Rhode Island could accomplish the purpose

14

that it says it wants to accomplish, that is, keeping an

15

artificial price floor for alcoholic beverages simply by

16

setting tax rates or by setting minimum consumer prices.

17

QUESTION:

Well, now, there's no -- we don't

18

apply a least-restrictive means test in that fourth prong

19

of Central Hudson, so to show that something else might

20

have been done isn't enough, I don't think.

21

MR. LAWSON:

I'm not arguing for a least-

22

restrictive means test.

What I'm suggesting to the Court

23

is that, where the State has a choice between regulating

24

speech and not regulating speech at all, that it has an

25

obvious alternative that doesn't burden speech.

QUESTION:

1
2

Why isn't that a least-restrictive

means approach?
MR. LAWSON:

3

I don't think it is because I think

4

the least-restrictive means approach would deal with an

5

array of choices of various degrees of regulation of

6

speech.

7
8

The precedent that I would cite for this is the
recent Coors decision.

In the recent Coors decision, you

will recall, the Government was concerned with preventing

QUESTION:

Wasn't that a Federal regulation we

-- in Coors?

And here we're dealing

with a State regulation.

16

MR. LAWSON:

17

QUESTION:

That is correct.
And presumably the States have a

18

little more leeway because of the Twenty-first Amendment

1

in the area of control of alcoholic beverages sales.

20

MR. LAWSON:

I would submit to you that the

21

State's power to control alcoholic beverages sales is not

22

dependent upon the Twenty-First amendment, but is inherent

23

in their police power --

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, surely the Twenty-First

Amendment extends some power to the States that they

MR. LAWSON:

QUESTION:

4

Yes, it does.
-- with respect to the Commerce

Clause --

5

MR. LAWSON:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. LAWSON:

Yes, it --- barriers.
Yes, it does, but what I'm

8

suggesting to you, and what I've argued, is that the

9

Twenty-first Amendment does not in any way cut back on the

10

force of the First Amendment as it is applied to the

11

States.

12

QUESTION:

How do you explain this Court's

13

action in Queensgate Investment Company in 1982, where the

14

Court dismissed for want of a substantial Federal question

15

a case where a State regulation of price advertizing of

16

liquor was upheld?

17

MR. LAWSON:

Well, quite frankly, I can't

18

explain it because the Court did not issue an opinion, and

19

the Court has said in other --

20

QUESTION:

21

substantial Federal question.

22

MR. LAWSON:

At least it said there wasn't a

That's correct, but the Court has

23

said on other occasions that a summary dismissal of this

24

sort does not imply even agreement with the opinion of the

25

court that is below.

1

2

QUESTION:

It's nonetheless a holding that the

appeal raises no substantial Federal question.

3

MR. LAWSON:

That is true.

4

Now, I can distinguish I think rather easily the

5

Queensgate facts from the facts of this case.

6

example, in the Queensgate situation, there was no blanket

7

ban on price advertizing.

8

a price advantage.

9

For

There was a ban on advertizing

It would seem to me that the State could, in

10

fact, have a higher level of justification.

11

arguing that that would be proper, but I think it clearly

12

distinguishes that from a total blackout of price

13

information, which is what's present in this case.

14

QUESTION:

I'm not

Do you think that Posadas is some

15

authority for saying that the State could ban any

16

advertizing at all of alcoholic beverages?

17

MR. LAWSON:

I don't think that Posadas is quite

18

that strong an authority.

19

as I read it, it suggests that if the State wants to

20

stifle demand for a product, at least under the

21

circumstances of Posadas it could do so by stifling

22

advertizing.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

I think that what Posadas says,

Do you think Rhode Island could ban

all advertizing of alcoholic beverages?
MR. LAWSON:

As I read the Court's jurisprudence

1

with the question put in that fashion, I think the answer

2

is no, because what this Court has said is that States may

3

not ban truthful, nonmisleading advertizing.

4

however, restrict it if they do so in accordance with the

5

Central Hudson test, so if you put the question in terms

6

of a general ban, my answer to that would be no.

7
8

9

QUESTION:

They may,

Even though they could ban any sale

or consumption of liquor.
MR. LAWSON:

Yes, and the reason for that, Your

10

Honor, is that it seems to me that the States must always

11

act in accordance with the Constitution.

12

3
4

QUESTION:

Well, how does that square with

Posadas, your position?
MR. LAWSON:

Well, the way it squares with

5

Posadas is that, first of all, in Posadas the Court was

6

not confronted with a total ban on advertizing.

7

confronted with a partial restriction on certain types of

8

advertizing, so that in terms of a precedential effect, it

9

seems to me you cannot simply take the Posadas result and

20
21

22

graft it onto this case.
QUESTION:
all advertizing.

Well, it's the same here.

It's not

It's advertizing a price.

23

MR. LAWSON:

24

QUESTION:

25

It was

That's right.
You can advertize liquor all you

like, just not the price.

2

that's why --

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. LAWSON:

So how is Posadas distinguished?
Posadas is distinguished only in

5

that each case must apply the Central Hudson test to the

6

facts that are before it.

7

The Court applied the Central Hudson test in

8

Posadas and found the particular ban in Posadas to be

9

justified.
QUESTION:

10

Isn't this case, counsel, more like

11

gambling ads than it is like the price of drugs approved

12

by the FDA?
MR. LAWSON:

13
J

I agree with you, and I think

I don't think that it is.

I think

14

it's very distinguishable from that because of what the

That's probably true as well.
It couldn't ban professional

MR. LAWSON:

QUESTION:

6

I think -- well, I'm not sure

Are we resurrecting Lochner here?

7

Why couldn't the State say no opticians -- is there

8

some -- is Lochner back with us?

9

MR. LAWSON:

I think --no, I think the State

10

has a great deal of power to ban many things, and that's

11

why I think that the logic of saying, simply because you

12

may have the power to ban something, that you then have

13

the power to ban speech about something that you're not

14

banning, is quite a different proposition.

that it?
MR. LAWSON:

2

I don't think so.

I think that the

3

State -- I think that before you get to the kinds of

4

questions of whether the State could ban toothpaste, you

5

have to get through practical political considerations.

6
7

I think that there are certain things that the
State can't --

QUESTION:

saying whether it could.

10

MR. LAWSON:

QUESTION:

12

I'm not saying whether it would, I'm
I don't think any State would.

I think that -I wouldn't want to run on that

ticket.

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. LAWSON:

I don't think in Rhode Island you

15

would want to run on the raising-the-price-of-alcoholic-

16

beverages ticket, either.

17

QUESTION:

No, but the point is, you would say

18

that if the State could ban toothpaste, and let's assume

19

it could unless you believe in Lochner, it still

20

nonetheless could not ban toothpaste advertizing so long

21

as it did not ban toothpaste.

22

MR. LAWSON:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

That's exactly my -- yes.
And you'd say liquor is no different

from toothpaste.
MR. LAWSON:

That's right.

1

2

suppose --

3

MR. LAWSON:

4

QUESTION:

5
6

That's a hard position to maintain, I

Well, I think --- that liquor is no different from

toothpaste.
MR. LAWSON:

Well, I think that the Court has

7

certainly suggested in the Coors case that when analyzing

8

bans on commercial speech, it is not appropriate to

9

recognize some hierarchy of products some of which are

10
11
12

entitled to more protection than others.
QUESTION:

Well, may I take us away from

toothpaste and back to gambling?

13

MR. LAWSON:

14

QUESTION:

Yes.
If I just look at this Court's

15

precedent and I say, well, there's Virginia Board and that

16

concern, advertizing the price of drugs, and then there's

17

the restriction on advertizing to locals gambling casinos,

18

so it seems to me liquor is closer to gambling casinos

19

than it is to drugs, so why doesn't Posadas control?

20

MR. LAWSON:

It doesn't control in the sense

21

that -- it controls in the sense that you apply the

22

Central Hudson test to the facts of the case.

23

control in the sense that the application of the Central

24

Hudson test to this case yields a contrary result than it

25

would yield, or than it yielded in Posadas.

QUESTION:

1

What I wonder is, if -- just going

2

back for a second to where you started, suppose that a

3

State thinks the following, people think this in the

4

legislature:

5

we're worried about them drinking too much, and we don't

6

mind if the price is high or if small retailers make a lot

7

of money, because they're in neighborhoods, and we're

8

afraid that if there are a lot of advertizing for price,

9

all the high school students will run up where they say

we don't mind if people buy liquor, but

10

beer at half-price this week, or whiskey reduced

11

30 percent.
And we're just afraid that people will start

12

13

running and drink more when they see those advertized

14

specials and so we think it's a sort of middle position,

15

let them drink, let the price be fairly -- a little higher

16

than it otherwise would, but let's stop these advertizings

17

of specials, et cetera, because then we don't get as many

18

drunken drivers, and we don't get as much abuse of the

19

product.

20

Now, suppose that's what they thought.

22

Constitution?

MR. LAWSON:

I think that under the Central

out a plausible case.

7

Maybe they couldn't, and then that would be
easy, but let's assume they make out a plausible case of
just the facts I said.

QUESTION:

In Justice Breyer's example, can't

11

you concede that the State might very well, under those

circumstances, prevail without conceding that the State

13

prevails in this case, because you've got at least one

14

added overlay, it seems to me, in this case, and that is

15

you've got a lot of -- or, you've got some empirical

16

studies done by parties who are not interested in this

think intuitively, a very common sense view -- I mean,

QUESTION:

Mr. Lawson, why are you going away

2

from your first point, which was, if they want to keep the

3

price high, there are ways that they can keep the price

4

high that don't involve speech?

5

something else besides keeping the price high.

6

That's -- the State said

They say, we can deter liquor sales 1) by having

7

a price, also making it harder to find what you want.

8

can't just run in and say, give me the special that you

9

advertized in the paper, the search time, and there I

10
11

You

don't see your nonspeech alternative working.
MR. LAWSON:

Well, the problem with the State's

12

position on the search time argument, which is the generic

13

problem with the State's position, is that in order for

14

its theory to work, there has to be enough of a shift in

15

prices that there will actually be an effect on

16

consumption.

17

This is what the State's expert talked about as

18

the optimum price, and the State's expert conceded that

19

1) he didn't know what the optimum price would be, and he

20

essentially conceded that he had no way of knowing, and in

21

view of the fact that Rhode Island, with its price ban in

22

effect for almost 40 years, was in the top third in

23

consumption, there was no evidence to show that the

24

State's theory worked.

25

And the three studies that were introduced,

1

including the Ornstein and Hanssens study that the State

2

relied on, indicated that the price advertizing ban had no

3

effect on consumption in what are called licensed States,

4

that is, States that use the free enterprise system.

5

Therefore, there simply is a failure of proof of

6

the connection between an effect on price and an adequate

7

effect on price.

Mr. Lawson, why isn't it just common

the point about the commercial speech doctrine, and that

No, I'm not saying that's the

If we buy the uniqueness argument, are we in

13

effect saying that Posadas was incorrectly decided, so

14

that we would have to overrule -- in effect we would be

15

implicitly overruling that?

16

MRS. PARTINGTON:

No.

I think Posadas

17

explicitly found that since the State, or since Puerto

18

Rico could ban gambling altogether, the restriction on

19

speech was permissible as long as the Central Hudson

20

test --

21

QUESTION:

Then why don't you take that as your

22

argument here because Rhode Island could, in fact,

23

preclude the importation and sale of any liquor

24

whatsoever, it therefore can regulate its advertizing?

25

I mean, if the Posadas argument is good, why

isn't it good for you?

MRS.

PARTINGTON:

That has been one of the

arguments of the State up until this point.

However,

footnote 2 in Rubin convinced me that perhaps to set out

5

to prove that the Central Hudson test had been met was

6

perhaps the wisest and simplest way to go about this case,

7

and the State believes that the Central Hudson test has

8

been met.
We also believe that the greater power to ban

does include the lesser,

11

point in this case today.
