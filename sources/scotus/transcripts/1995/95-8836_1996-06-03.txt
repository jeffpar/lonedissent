order from an appropriate panel of judges in the court of

appeals.

4

Subsection (C), to which we will have more

5

reference, provides -- and that is set out on page 3 --

6

the court of appeals may authorize the filing of a second

7

or successive application only if it determines that the

8

application makes a prima facie showing that the applicant

9

satisfies the relevant substantive criteria.

10

Subsection -- finally, we turn to section

11

103(E), which is at the bottom of page 3, and that

provides the grant or denial of any authorization by the

court of appeals to file a second or successive

subject of a petition for rehearing or for a writ of

certiorari.

On May 1, a petition was filed in this Court

18

styled a writ of habeas -- on May 2, a petition was filed

19

in this Court styled as a

corpus for appellate or certiorari review, and among other

21

things the petition invoked this Court's jurisdiction

under 2241(a), the so-called original habeas jurisdiction

of this Court, which from time out of mind has existed as

I will, of course,
To the extent

10

that time permits and the Court feels it helpful, I would

While the petition for a writ of

With the sole exception of Senator Hatch, the

5

amici took the same position.

6

in its reply brief, Georgia now seems to have moved from a

7

position that sparing review under section 224 (a) is

8

permitted, and to a position in which it now seems to

9

argue no review at all is possible under 224 (a), that

10

Perhaps I am mistaken, but

this was the congressional intention.

11

To the extent that Georgia does so in its reply

12

brief, it does so without addressing any of the arguments

3

that we advanced in our initial brief based upon plain

4

meaning, nor does it discuss the relevance of this Court's

5

citations going back at least to Martin v. Hunter's Lessee

6

and Cohens v. Virginia, which postulate the need for

7

uniformity in the administration of Federal law, and in

8

Cohens a reluctance to interpret congressional statutes to

9

foreclose appellate jurisdiction.

20

Nor does it even refer to McCardle and Yerger,

21

despite our heavy reliance upon those cases for the

22

proposition that the rule laid down in Cohens v. Virginia,

which is that you do not construe congressional

24

legislation to impair your jurisdiction unless it's clear

25

it has a special stringent effect when claims involving

1

constitutional right involving the deprivation of liberty

2

are at stake.

3

The Georgia reply brief does make one

4

substantive argument.

5

if habeas were available, since the warden would have no

6

opportunity to get review of a decision.

7

It asserts that it would be unfair

On its face, this is a very curious argument,

8

because habeas corpus has always been asymmetrical in that

9

respect.

No one has ever thought it was unfair to the

10

State that the writ might be available to the prisoner on

11

appropriate circumstances.
QUESTION:

12

Well, but if it is, indeed, an

3

appellate -- if the original writ of habeas corpus, as you

4

say, is appellate in this case, then it does seem that the

5

prisoner could obtain relief, but certainly it does not

6

seem, under cases like Yerger, that the warden could.

7

MR. MONAGHAN:

That's exactly right, Your Honor,

8

but I think that that -- I think first of all, two things.

9

I think that asymmetry is built into the nature of habeas

20

corpus.

21

warden can't bring a declaratory judgment suit against the

22

prisoner.

23

The prisoner always can sue for the writ, but the

QUESTION:

Well, but in an appellate situation,

24

supposing the district court grants a writ of habeas

25

corpus, the State or the Government can appeal from the

MR. MONAGHAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

Well,

let me put it -- maybe a different response.

is a new asymmetry into the statute.

it will go down to the district court.

the case will come back up to the court of appeals and go

QUESTION:

11

really screening --

However it rules,

You say the court of appeals is just

MR. MONAGHAN:

12

The warden

The court of appeals is supposed

13

to engage in a gatekeeping function here, but one of the

14

points we want to make is that the court of appeals

15

decided the merits of this case,

16

I'm going to address, which is the -- and it decided it in

17

an egregious manner,

18

But it did not perform a gatekeeping function here, but

19

that's a -- that goes to a somewhat different point.
QUESTION:

20

and that's a point which

if you actually study what it did.

Yes.

Certainly,

if you're correct in

21

your position and the Solicitor General that certiorari

22

doesn't lie here,

23

that,

there's no way of directly reviewing

is there?

24

MR. MONAGHAN:

25

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.

But I take it your theory of -- that

1

sort of neutralizes the warden's complaint is not merely

2

that there is an asymmetry in the very structure of habeas

3

practice, but that the result of the probable cause

4

determination when it goes against the warden ultimately

5

is merged in what happens in the district court, and it's

6

like many preliminary orders that are merged before any

7

ultimate review takes place.
MR. MONAGHAN:

8

9

That's -- yes, Your Honor, and if

there is an asymmetry, if there were, it would hardly

10

strike me as a point of great substance, given the

11

tradition of the writ of habeas corpus.
Now, Senator Hatch's brief devotes a scant two

12

13

pages, pages that are tacked on at the very end of his

14

brief, to the argument that section 106 bars original

15

habeas.

16

the arguments we make or the authorities we invoke.

17

Senator Hatch's brief is, however, very interesting for

18

what it does not state.

19

Like Georgia's reply brief, he addresses none of

Despite the brief's copious references to the

20

number and comprehensive character of the Senate and House

21

debates, Senator Hatch cites not a single sentence of

22

legislative history that indicates that Congress gave the

23

slightest thought to this Court's original jurisdiction.

24

Senator Hatch's brief constitutes a form of postenactment

25

legislative history.

1

QUESTION:

It suggests, though, does it not,

2

that it was -- Mr. Monaghan, that it was omitted

3

inadvertently, because what does come across from that

4

brief was the intention to foreclose any review if the

5

appellate panel refused to certify.

6

MR. MONAGHAN:

Well, if the argument is that it

7

was inadvertently omitted, I might say that this Court is

8

not authorized to write legislation that Congress might

9

have written but didn't write.

10

If it was inadvertently omitted, then Congress

11

will presumably get a chance to do it, but it's not the

12

function of this Court to rewrite the statute, and I think

13

adherence to that principle is especially important,

14

because it would curtail the historic jurisdiction of this

15

Court, a curtailment that, as we have suggested, would

16

raise some constitutional problems.

17

Finally, we have no idea whether Congress would

18

or would not have enacted legislation that in terms

19

directly sought to impair the appellate jurisdiction of

20

this Court, so --

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Monaghan, what about jurisdiction

22

in this Court under the All Writs Act by way of writ of

23

mandamus, or something of that sort?

QUESTION:

1

2

Either.

Either.

How does the act

affect that, do you suppose?

3

MR. MONAGHAN:

That's a hard question, Your

4

Honor, because it doesn't impair jurisdiction under the

5

All Writs Act, either, and there is at least one case,

6

House v. Mayo, in which effectively habeas corpus relief

7

was given under section 1651, but there is a body of case

8

law in your Court, last invoked in an opinion by Justice

9

Scalia last year, or early this year, which says that

10

section 106 is inoperative if there's a specific provision

11

that deals with the proposed remedy, and so that brings

12

you back to 2241(a), and for that reason I was unwilling

13

to brief that point.

14

QUESTION:

How would 2241(a) work on your

15

interpretation?

16

the court of appeals has failed to certify?

17

petitioner apply to both places simultaneously, or is

18

there some sequence, or can the appellate panel be

19

bypassed altogether and come directly here?

Does this Court have authority only after

Can a

Well, the various briefs, if you

21

look at them carefully, sharply divide on what happens if

22

you have authority to entertain the writ and, given the

23

limited time constraints and the lack of developments in

24

the brief, we can only give you our initial thoughts about

25

this .

It's also quite unclear from the United States'

habeas corpus.

13

QUESTION:

Well, our Rule 20 says you have to

14

have sought relief everywhere else before coming here for

15

an original writ, doesn't it?

16

MR. MONAGHAN:

And that's our position.

Our

17

position is that you must go to the panel first, and then

18

you seek review here, and the question then becomes, what

19

does this Court do once it gets the case, and on that

20

point, we take as a baseline what was said in the Schlup

21

case.

constitutional system, we do not believe that the original

2

jurisdiction could be invoked to decide routine factual

3

questions or resolve routine questions of the application

4

of law to fact.

5

But having said all that, it seems to me that

6

there are essentially two kinds of questions that are

7

going to arise.

an original writ, and we think that this petition raises

10

The first set concerns the meaning of

important questions about what

We think that's open on

06 really does mean.

11

The second set, and here's where the Solicitor

12

General and us seem to depart, concerns the role of this

3
4

Court apart from simply interpreting section 224 .
QUESTION:

Before you go on to the second point,

5

that first point is the only way in which we could get

6

into that interpretation of what

7

MR. MONAGHAN:

No.

06 really means?

It's possible that you would

8

get -- it was possible you would get some of these

9

questions in the grant context.

20

Now, but as Justice Souter points out, in the

21

grant context you're using -- if the writ is rejected or

22

sustained in the lower Federal courts you're really on the

23

merits of the claim.

questions under section

9

MR. MONAGHAN:

Yes, and that is a -- that's a

10

question which we may have flubbed.

We understood that

11

largely, I think, Your Honor, in terms of -- although

12

we're prepared to discuss it, we understood it largely in

13

terms of the problem of foreclosure of review in this

14

Court, and not with respect to briefing on the question of

MR. MONAGHAN:

2

You had it under the All Writs

Act.

4

There never has been a point in time in which -- to the

5

best of my knowledge, in which you couldn't review a

criminal conviction of either a State or Federal court on

7

the ground that there was a violation of a Federal right.

You exercised it routinely in the 19th Century.

10

Well, there was certainly a lot of

criminal convictions in the 19th Century, you could not
appeal them and they were not reviewed here.
MR. MONAGHAN:

11

They were not reviewed, and the

difference was in the 19th Century what the -- if you

look -- there's a nice discussion by Dallin Oaks in his

article.

what happened in the 19th Century, starting with Ex parte

habeas corpus could not reach anything in 1789 other than

With specific reference to that,

Mr. Chief Justice, our position is that, while the

2

doesn't interfere with the Court's original jurisdiction

3

because essentially, as has been said earlier, we're

asking the Court to look at it as an appellate -- part of

question, it's not interfering with the original

We're asking that the Court use the

backdrop of its rules and its jurisprudence to find it has

no applicability in the context of successive habeas

6

7

because, if this Court has the right to guarantee a direct

8

access of the petitioner to this Court, then essentially

9

this Court becomes a lower court who is doing nothing but

10

relitigating what Congress has delegated to the lower

But Ms. Boleyn, part of the Yerger

that Article III gives to this Court, there can be no

It's -- they're saying that it's exercising

would be actually acting as a factfinder determining the

By the terms of the act, yes.

It's our position that insofar as 2241 exists for

7

successive State habeas, that the Court should find itself

8

to be bound by those issues just the same way that the

9

Court found in its rules that it was bound by exhaustion

requirements and, of course, that the petitioner under

this Court's rule has to establish why it hasn't sought

MS. BOLEYN:

It would just be removed in

Yes, and I think that's exactly

what we're asking the Court not to do, not to denigrate

19

the Court's Article III jurisdiction by going and becoming

20

a factfinder.

21

factfinding screening process, as the petitioner said, to

22

the lower courts, so we're asking the Court to reserve the

23

direct writ, as we choose to call it, for those rare and

24

extraordinary circumstances where there is not another

25

avenue of relief.

Congress has tried to delegate that

He had another avenue of relief.

He was simply-

2

found to have been foreclosed by the lower court, so by

3

its terms we do not think that where the other avenues of

QUESTION:

So your position basically is if the

6

court of appeals under this act turns down the petitioner,

7

that there's no occasion for the exercise of our original

8

jurisdiction even though it exists, because he had another

9

avenue of relief but he was found to not meet the

10

standards for it?
MS. BOLEYN:

11
12

3

That's our position, except perhaps

in those cases where, as Mr. Felker did, the jurisdiction
of the Court as a whole has been challenged.

4

Our position is another option that the

5

petitioner had was, he could have filed a writ of mandamus

6

against the Eleventh Circuit asking that they interpret

7

the act.

8
9
20
21

So the only exceptional relief that he could
have sought was not just simply try to file an original
habeas corpus petition -QUESTION:

Well, mandamus is no more readily

22

granted here than original habeas corpus, I think.

23

don't know that that's a way around the difficulty.

relief such as the type that the petitioner is seeking in

2

this case, for example, that there's no jurisdiction of

the type of situation that the Court might want to

exercise its jurisdiction.

MS. BOLEYN:

There is no

Your Honor, I think -So how does mandamus work?
Your Honor, I think that perhaps I

15

was not clear about what I was saying.

16

always remains an avenue of relief for a Federal habeas

18

the Court, but the petitioner in this case, his only

19

avenue perhaps may have been to try to challenge the

20

constitutionality of the new act by means of some sort of

21

extraordinary relief.

22

I think that there

Maybe he would have chosen the mandamus or

23

declaratory judgment, or some other extraordinary relief,

24

but insofar as he's trying to invoke the jurisdiction of

25

this Court to review the fact that the Eleventh Circuit

said he hadn't made a prima facie case and he wasn't

2

entitled to relief under the old act, our position is he

3

should not be able to invoke the original extraordinary

4

jurisdiction of the Court for that purpose.
QUESTION:

5

Then he shouldn't be able -- I take

6

it it's your position he should not be able to invoke that

7

original extraordinary jurisdiction, as you put it, for

8

any purpose that would result in his getting substantive

relief.

10

MS. BOLEYN:

11

QUESTION:

12

Correct.
You are saying the only thing he can

litigate under that jurisdiction is jurisdiction itself.

13

MS. BOLEYN:

14

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
So that if you win on that point, in

15

fact there will never be again an extraordinary case in

16

which this Court might invoke its original jurisdiction to

review the particularities of the case.
MS. BOLEYN:

case, but only if there's something overriding.

MS. BOLEYN:

QUESTION:

Right.
-- what more would you propose than

3

what our rule already says, which is exceptional

4

circumstances rarely granted?

5

MS. BOLEYN:

I think, Your Honor, what we have

6

proposed is that the Court interpreted -- there's another

7

portion of that rule that talks about that the petitioner

8

has to establish that he has no other forum available to

9

litigate his claim and no other avenues of relief.

10

We're saying that the petitioner seems to

11

interpret that as saying that he has nothing left now, not

12

that he never had anything.

3

And what we're trying to get this Court is to

4

interpret its own rules as saying that, having had cert

5

jurisdiction in this case three times already, and he

6

still has remaining a petition for cert available if he

7

wishes to review the judgment of the State habeas corpus

8

court dismissing the second petition, that that's not the

9

same thing as never having a forum in which to litigate

20

your claim, that that particular forum is not meant for

21

repetitive litigation of the same issues that have already

22

been adjudicated adversely to a petitioner.

would hope you would interpret the rules further, not to

MS. BOLEYN:

Why doesn't that satisfy the text

I think because in a new claim

It's no more egregious to bar him from consideration of a

That's no different.

13

GENERAL DAYS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Section 106 of title I of the 1996 act does not

14

unconstitutionally restrict the jurisdiction of this

15

Court, at least where Congress does not divest this Court

16

of jurisdiction to entertain original petitions for writs

17

of habeas corpus.

18

no constitutional problem is presented.

19

Both McCardle and Yerger establish that

Unlike the State of Georgia, we believe that

20

this Court's jurisdiction over original habeas and section

21

106 are capable of coexistence.

22

in terms does not address itself to this Court's

23

original -- this Court's jurisdiction over original habeas

24

under 2241, and there's no reason why this Court should

25

read the statute with that intent in mind.

Therefore, we

1

do not view the continuation of this Court's jurisdiction

2

over original habeas as in some way representing an

3

invasion or a circumvention.

4

What exactly is it that the Court

would be reviewing under its original habeas jurisdiction?

Is it, in fact, some kind of appellate review, and --

No, not under these

circumstances.
Mr. Monaghan referred to our brief at page 23.

11

the Chief Justice,

12

McCardle and Yerger were cases having to do with the

13

Federal court system, and had nothing to do with State

14

detention, which is presented by this particular case.

15
16

QUESTION:
to my question?

17

it's complicated by the fact that by

Well,

so are you changing your answer

What is --

GENERAL DAYS:

The Court would not,

on original

18

habeas, be reviewing a determination by the court of

19

appeals.

20

Felker,

21

It would be with respect to why,

in this case

is still being detained by the State of Georgia.
QUESTION:

It would be the same as if the

22

district court under prior practice had been asked to

23

issue a writ against the warden.

24
25

GENERAL DAYS:

After all,

the warden is here as

the respondent.

2

QUESTION:

So what it means is, it is appellate

in the Article III sense because it can't be original.

3

GENERAL DAYS:

4

QUESTION:

That'S correct.

But it is original in the sense that

5

it is going to the merits of the habeas claim rather than

6

to the specific determination by the court of appeals that

7

no prima facie case was made.

GENERAL DAYS:

QUESTION:

11

GENERAL DAYS:

3

The person is

saying, I'm being detained --

10

12

That's right.

Yes.
-- in violation of the

constitutional laws or treaties of the United States.
QUESTION:

And I would suppose that in making

4

that determination we would be free to look, on your view,

5

at whatever had been presented in the court of appeals

6

simply as a convenient place where evidence was reposing.

7

GENERAL DAYS:

8

QUESTION:

That's correct.

May I also ask if it's your view

9

that, assuming -- we're all very doubtful of some of these

20

things -- that there is such an original, quote, appellate

21

habeas in this Court, would 224 (b) nevertheless apply and

22

authorize this Court to transfer for a hearing the case to

23

a district court, in your view?

24
25

GENERAL DAYS:

I'm not very clear about that.

Certainly the statute has not been changed.

It's not

1

clear exactly what that transfer would mean.

2

in dealing with original petitions in recent times has not

3

used that transfer power.

4

QUESTION:

5

GENERAL DAYS:

This Court

But it's on the books.
It's simply dismissed these cases

6

and sent them to whatever court is competent to resolve

7

those issues.

8

9

But I think that in order not to evade the
statutory scheme that Congress set up and in most

10

circumstances the transfer to the district court would be

11

for purposes of the district court's exercising whatever

12

jurisdiction it had available, and under this statutory

13

scheme that would mean that the court of appeals would

14

have to authorize the applicant to go forward in the

15

district court before the district court could go forward.

16

This is not something that we would obviously

17

agree, but it seems to us that that makes some sense in

18

terms of reconciling 2241(b) and section 106, the

19

gatekeeper provisions.

20

QUESTION:

But we might take the position that

21

the gatekeeper determination having been made, the

22

district court could have no jurisdiction, so we couldn't

23

send it to the district court, and if we needed evidence

24

taken in a really extraordinary case, I suppose we could

25

use a master, isn't that true?

1

GENERAL DAYS:

Yes, that is also possible.

2

One of the things that I wanted to point out

3

that I think is contrary to the State of Georgia.

4

Georgia's position with respect to this circumvention and

5

evasion is that Congress apparently did not see the

6

continuation of this Court's jurisdiction over original

7

habeas as being a circumvention.

8

9

03 of the act, that was a decision by Congress to amend
Rule 22 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.

10

QUESTION:

11

GENERAL DAYS:

12

If one looks at section

Where do we find

0 -- that portion.

That's at point 4 and 5a of the

appendix to our brief, Mr. Chief Justice.

3

What Congress did there is amend the

4

jurisdiction of Federal circuit judges to grant original

5

habeas, and basically said that that was no longer

6

possible.

7

address original habeas jurisdiction when it wants to, and

8

it concluded that it did not wish to do so insofar as the

9

Supreme Court was concerned.

It seems to us that Congress knows how to

And to us, this makes great sense, because after

20
21

all Congress was legislating against a backdrop of this

22

Court's decisions and its policies, and there are two

23

things to note about those particular decisions and

24

policies.

25

One is that for over 70 years this Court has

1

attempted to impose reasonable restrictions over the abuse

2

of the writ, particularly second or successive petitions,

3

and secondly, in dealing with original habeas petitions

4

this Court has, as several of you on the bench, Mr. Chief

5

Justice and others, have pointed out, this Court has

6

imposed very stringent requirements before granting

7

original habeas.

8

parte Grossman in 1925.

9

There hasn't been one granted since Ex

Not only that, the statute 2241(b) that Mr.

10

Justice Stevens just mentioned, 2242, which requires that

11

there be some showing of why the applicant hadn't gone to

12

another court, and 2254(b), the old 2254(b), essentially

13

indicated that no petition would be granted unless it

14

could be shown that relief was not available any place

15

else.

16

So -QUESTION:

Well, but why aren't those two

17

readily met by simply saying, I can't go some place else

18

because the court of appeals said I couldn't?

19

GENERAL DAYS:

Well, I think it is.

That is,

20

the applicant can go to the Court, having met those

21

requirements, if that applicant has gone through the

22

gatekeeper process, but that does not dictate that the

23

Court should actually entertain and grant an original writ

24

under those circumstances.

25

QUESTION:

But the fact that relief is available

1

elsewhere is no longer an obstacle to that relief, you

2

say.

3

GENERAL DAYS:

Well, certainly it's been

4

exhausted, but I think that what the Court would do is say

5

that the fact that the person has been denied, the

6

applicant has been denied through the gatekeeper process,

7

does not represent an exceptional circumstance that would

8

warrant this Court's consideration of that application.

11

QUESTION:

In the case of an extraordinary error

by a circuit court, would we have mandamus jurisdiction?
GENERAL DAYS:

Justice Kennedy, I think mandamus

12

probably is used the way it's been used, to deal with

13

ministerial acts, the failure of lower courts to perform

14

ministerial acts.

15

available, but certainly the original petition would be

16

available to deal with miscarriages of justice, or what

17

might be viewed by this Court as a malfunction of the

18

gatekeeper process.

19

QUESTION:

I don't think that that would be

Well, following up on Justice

20

Kennedy's thought, what about the common law writ of

21

certiorari that was used in House v. Mayo?

22

GENERAL DAYS:

I think that since the statutory

23

original certiorari jurisdiction was available, there

24

would be no need for this Court to use that particular

25

common law writ.
