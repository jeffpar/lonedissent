Mr. Christopherson, you may proceed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. CHRISTOPHERSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:
This case is about the authority of a district

11
12

court.

13

court, up to sentencing, has the authority to make a

14

decision on whether or not the evidence against the

15

defendant was sufficient to convict him.

16

The issue in this case is whether the district

The Government's position in this case is that

17

the limitation on the ability of a defendant to file a

18

motion, the 7-day limitation in Rule 29(c), also limits

19

the court's authority.

20

It's our position that the rule is clear, it's

21

concise, and that it gives the court the authority to --

22

QUESTION:

Well, the rule is clear.

It imposes

23

the 7-day limit, and Rule 45 says that the court may not

24

extend the time for taking any action under Rule 29,

25

except to the extent and under the conditions stated

therein, and I don't know why that isn't sufficiently

2

clear that there's an absolute 7-day limit.

3

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

It is not sufficiently

4

clear, Your Honor, because I think the second sentence in

5

subparagraph (a) of 2

6

its own motion to rule on a judgment of acquittal based

7

upon the insufficiency of the evidence.

8

QUESTION:

gives the court the authority on

Now, you -- where do we find the

second sentence set out in haec verba in your brief or
10

somewhere else in the papers?

11

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

12

It's actually, I think, set

out on page 2 of the Government's brief.

13

QUESTION:

Page 2 of the Government's brief?

14

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

Yes.

It's on page 2 of yours, I think.
I think I put subparagraph

17

(c) there but not (a), if I'm -- it's in my reply brief,

18

also, but it's in the Government's brief.

1

That sentence, which is in mandatory language,

20

indicated that the court shall, gives the court the

21

authority to order a judgment of acquittal based upon the

22

insufficiency of the evidence after the evidence on either

23

side is closed.

24
25

That sentence --

QUESTION:

Now, whereabouts on page 2 are you

reading from, page 2 of the Government's brief?

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

1

Subparagraph (a), the

2

second sentence, which starts, the court on motion of a

3

defendant.

4

QUESTION:

Thank you.

5

QUESTION:

In order to make that argument, you

6

have to ignore the title of the paragraph, of the

7

subparagraph, I take it.

8

9

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

Well, the title to the

subpara -- that's correct, Your Honor.

The title to the

10

subparagraph is not the text, and this Court should only

11

obviously look to the title if there's some ambiguity.

12

QUESTION:

Well, it may not be the text, but it

13

gives you some indication of what category of cases the

14

rule is addressed to, and that suggests that Rule (a) is

15

addressed to motions made before submission to the jury.

16

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

If you read -- I disagree

17

for this reason.

18

subparagraph (a), that has nothing to do with motions

19

before submission to a jury.

If you read the first sentence of

20

The third sentence of subparagraph (a)

21

QUESTION:

--

Well, I think -- you're saying that

22

the statement motions for a directed verdict are

23

abolished, and motions for a judgment of acquittal shall

24

be used in -- have nothing to do with motions before

25

submission to the jury?

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

1

No,

I'm not saying they

2

have nothing to do, but I think that's a -- that's a

3

general statement which is not simply limited to motions

4

before submission to a jury.
QUESTION:

5

Well, when do you ordinarily make a

6

motion for a directed verdict?

7

my experience, it was always before you had -- the case

8

was submitted to the jury.

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:
percent of the cases.
QUESTION:

11
12

It's always --at least in

I think that's true in 99.9

I think there certainly -Well, tell us about the .1 percent of

the cases it's not -MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

13

Well, I mean, it can be

14

submitted to a jury and somebody can still come in and ask

15

for a directed verdict.
QUESTION:

16
17

No, you come in and ask for a

judgment N.O.V.

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

QUESTION:

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

21

QUESTION:

22

23

After the verdict.

Yes.
Yes.

So where else do you find this .1

percent?
MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

Well, once it's -- I guess

24

what I'm saying is, submission -- I guess you're getting

25

into the definition of what is submission to the jury.

I

mean, there could be --

2

QUESTION:

3

struggle over that.

4

I didn't think there would be a

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

Theoretically, a case could

5

be submitted to the jury, and it could be before a

6

verdict.

7

But if I may, Your Honor, I think --

8

QUESTION:

9
10

A case could be submitted to the

jury -- tell me that again.
MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

The jury could be out

11

deliberating, I guess is what I'm saying.

12

how you define submission to a jury.

13

QUESTION:

It depends on

And one would make a motion for a

14

directed verdict that one had not made before submission

15

to the jury.

16

You would make it while the jury was out?

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

It's certainly not a

17

preferred practice, but all I'm saying is that's a

18

possibility.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Christopherson, the origin of the

20

motion for directed verdict, it was just that.

The judge

21

told the jury come in with a verdict, and then that was

22

eliminated, that formality was eliminated, but the words

23

mean what they say.

24

come in with such-and-such a verdict, so I don't think

25

you're going to get very far with trying to say that the

It was a motion to direct the jury to

1

first sentence is broader than what the traditional

2

understanding of directed verdict is.
QUESTION:

3

If we disagree with you, and if we

4

say that section (a) applies only to motions before the

5

jury retires, before the case is submitted to the jury, do

6

you lose the case?

7

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

No, Justice Kennedy, and my

8

position is first of all that the second sentence of

9

Rule (a) is clear and gives the court the authority, but

10

if the Court does not agree with that, then my argument,

11

as I think I indicated in my briefs, that there's a line

12

of cases by this Court, from the unique circumstances

13

cases which were Thompson and Harris Truck Line, the Gaea

14

case discussing supervisory power, and Houston v. Lack,

15

that there are exceptions that may allow this to go

16

forward.

17

But if I can get back to the rule, I think I

18

would also like to make this argument under (c).

19

read the first sentence of (c), it talks about motions

20

which are made or renewed, and I think if you look at the

21

second sentence of (a), it talks about the court of its

22

own motion.

23

I think that's a distinction.

24

talking about motions made or renewed.

25

make or renew a motion.

Sentence two

2

QUESTION:

Well, then you're -- are you saying

3

that it's just implicit in 29(c) that the judge has at any

4

time the authority sua sponte to enter the judgment of

5

acquittal?
MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

6

Up to the time of

7

sentencing, yes.

There's nothing in (c) that limits the

8

judge.

9

judge does not have the power sua sponte.

There's no specific language in (c) that says the

10

Paragraph -- I mean, it's the second sentence --

11

QUESTION:

It wouldn't make much sense to limit

12

the motions to 7 days, so I mean, what do you -- you just

13

come in 1C days later and say, Your Honor, I'm not making

14

a motion, but I think it would be a good idea if you on

15

your own accord would enter a judgment of acquittal.

16

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

17

QUESTION:

I think --

Do you really think the rule is that

18

silly?

days, but you can ask the judge to use his inherent

20

authority to do this thing.

21

You don't make -- you can't make a motion after 7

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

I think the judge in that

22

case, if you follow my reading of the rule, could simply

23

tell the court, don't accept that motion, it's untimely.

24

It's the exceptional case, and remember that we're talking

25

about situations where the judge has sat through the

1

trial, and so the judge knows what happened.

2

exceptional case.

It's the

Judge Enslin in this case, based upon the

3
4

transcript, said that what he did was initially in August,

5

when he denied the motion, he wrote two separate opinions

6

and two separate orders, and he said, this is the first

7

time in my judicial career I've ever done that.

8

Then, when it came time in October for

9

sentencing, he changed his mind, and it's my argument that

10

you can enforce the rule and say the 7 days applies, the

11

defendant has to file the motion by 7 days, but still

12

leave that authority for the court.

13

QUESTION:

Well, what about subsection (b) of

14

Rule 45, which is on -- which Justice O'Connor mentioned,

15

which is page 2a and 3a in the appendix to the

16

Government's brief, where it says the court may not extend

17

the time for taking any action to rules 29, et cetera,

18

except to the extent and under the conditions stated in

19

that.

20

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

I think this Court could

21

construe that to apply to the 7 days required when

22

defendant files a motion, but again, I say that, under

23

Rule (c), where it says made or renewed, that's a

24

defendant's motion, so 45 limits -- it could limit the

25

defendant's motion, but not the court on its own to make

that decision.

2

QUESTION:

Well then,

in effect you certainly

3

have a strong feeling here,

4

the people who made the rules thought it was desirable to

5

have these motions made promptly and disposed of promptly,

and yet in your view,

Doesn't that seem rather strange in the light of these

10

from reading these rules,

although it couldn't be done by

even though there were weeks afterwards.

very close time limits placed on the rule?
MR.

11

CHRISTOPHERSON:

No,

I don't,

because I,

12

know,

13

and I think there's good reasons to do that,

14

the rationale is you want the court to do what Judge

15

Enslin did in this case,

16

thought to this and even rethink his position.

17

that

you

think the time limits can constrain defense counsel,

but I think

and that is give considered

Well,

what if he gave considered

thought to it for about 9 months?
MR.

CHRISTOPHERSON:

Well,

obviously,

I mean,

20

you have to go to sentencing promptly,

21

lose jurisdiction after sentencing,

22

it would be appropriate for the court to do that for that

23

long a period.

24
25

QUESTION:

were still kind of turning the thing over in his mind?

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

1

2

I think that's potentially

possible.

3

I'm not here, I guess, arguing for a bright line

4

saying that 6 months or 9 months, but obviously that's not

5

the facts of this case, where it only happened over

6

2 months, and sentencing proceeded promptly, and I also

7

think, if you look at the rationale in U.S. v. Smith,

8

which is the case relied upon by the Government, that

9

after a long passage of time, and of course in that case,

10

that was after appeal, that the trial judge doesn't

11

remember the case, that just doesn't apply here.

I mean, in fact, just the opposite.

I wrote two separate orders.
I mean, he was thinking about this very

17

conscientiously, and so I think if you interpret the rule

18

in that manner, I think it's appropriate to allow him to

19

do that.

a motion, but it seems to me it does.

The second sentence

2

says, if a verdict of guilty is returned, the court may,

3

on such motion, set aside the verdict and enter judgment

4

of acquittal, but read the next sentence.
If no verdict is returned, the court may -- and

it notably leaves out, on such motion.

a

If no verdict is

It seems to me what it's saying is, when no

10

verdict is returned, the court may enter judgment of

11

acquittal on motion or on its own, whereas, if a verdict

12

of guilty is returned, it may only on such motion -- that

13

is, a motion filed within 7 days -- enter judgment of

14

acquittal.

15
16

What is your explanation for the -- for leaving
out, on such motion, from the third sentence of (c)?

17

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

Well, I think what I would

18

argue, Your Honor, is that when you read that in the

19

entire context of this rule, and especially the second

20

sentence of paragraph (a), where it says shall, I think

21

the word shall is a very strong word that gives the

22

court --

1

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

Okay.

-- for my purposes.
Well, then I think that

4

first of all we still have the first sentence, which says

5

made or renewed, and I believe that applies to a

6

defendant.

7

at best I would argue is ambiguous, and the Court then

8

should look at the policies under Rule 2 in trying to

9

interpret exactly what that sentence in Rule (c) means,

I think the language, on such motion, perhaps

10

and the policies under Rule 2 are fairness of

11

administration, and trying to avoid undue delay and undue

12

cost.
QUESTION:

13

Well, then you're saying that the

14

judge has authority -- I won't say inherent authority --

15

authority to enter a judgment of acquittal,

16

notwithstanding the provisions of Rule 29.

17

limited by Rule 29.

18
19

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

22

That's correct.

That's

21

He's not

But that again takes you away from

the rule.
MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

No, I don't -- because I

23

don't think the rule clearly states that the judge does

24

not have that authority, and so if the rules does not

25

state that and is ambiguous, then my argument is you have

1

to look at Rule 2.

2

That's the way you interpret the rest of the

3

rules,

and I think when you do that,

4

about fairness in the administration of justice,

5

you're talking about avoiding undue cost and undue delay,

6

that clearly those policies support our position that the

7

court does have the authority up to the time of sentencing

8

to determine whether the evidence --

9

QUESTION:

and you're talking

Where does it say that?

and

You say --

10

unless your position is that the courts have all powers

11

that are not specifically excluded by the rules, unless

12

that's your position, where in the rules does it say,

13

other than subsection (a), which I don't agree with --

14

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

15

QUESTION:

Right.

Where in the rules does it say that

16

the court has this power, without motion,

17

jury verdict?

18

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

Well,

19

sentence of Rule 57 gives the court,

20

powers also.

QUESTION:

1

Yes, but doesn't Rule 57 say in all

2

cases not provided for by rule, the district judge may

3

regulate their practice, and so forth, and the answer to

4

that is that in this case it is provided for by rule?
MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

5

The rule does not state

6

that the court does not have the power to look at the

7

sufficiency of the evidence and make that decision prior

8

to sentencing.

9

don't believe that when you look at the last sentence of

10

Rule 57, that my interpretation of Rule 29 is in any way

11

inconsistent with these rules.

The rule is not that specific, and so I

QUESTION:

12

Well, so you think the Western

13

District of Michigan in Grand Rapids could have a rule

14

saying that the judge can do this any time up to

15

sentencing, and the Eastern District in Detroit could have

16

a rule saying that no, you have to comply with Rule 29?

17

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

I think the local courts

18

could adopt rules, given the fact that this rule is

19

ambiguous.

20

I was -QUESTION:

If we interpreted the last sentence

21

of Rule 57 the way you want us to, namely it has to

22

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

2

QUESTION:

I agree.

But that only -- you only get to the

3

last half of the sentence if you pass the first part,

4

which says, in all cases not provided for by rule, and I

5

think that refers to subjects not handled by the rules,

6

such as the subject of when -- the subject of setting

7

aside a jury verdict, which is handled by the rules.
MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

8

9

But again, I mean, I don't

believe that specific issue we have today is handled by

10

the rules, and you have to get back to what the standard

is you're going to use to interpret the rules.
QUESTION:

12

Rule 29 --

Mr. Christopherson, as far as Rule 57

13

is concerned, this really isn't an area, is it, where it

14

would be appropriate for one district judge to act one way

15

and another district judge to act another way?

16

I thought the Federal Rules require certain

17

uniformity, and where they don't require uniformity, then

18

there's scope for local rules, and where neither requires

19

uniformity, then there's discretion, but you can't be

arguing that Judge Enslin can grant a motion to acquit in

take it that it would be an abuse of discretion for the

district judge not to sua sponte consider a motion for

1

Absolutely, I agree with

that, and I think that's what the judge did in this case,

and I think that's what we'd want judges to do if they

have a doubt as to the sufficiency of the evidence, and I

think that's the policy this Court should try to -QUESTION:

Let me ask you a question I'm going

to ask your opponent, so he can think about it in the

What about the power of the judge to act on his

how does the rule speak to that question?

Nothing in the rule authorizes the

judge to grant a judgment of acquittal in the first 6

days, but supposing a judge is concerned that there really

17

is no evidence at all here, but he has a lousy lawyer in

18

front of him, he thinks he won't get around to filing the

motion until 10 days later, could the judge take care of

the situation within the 6- or 7-day period?

21

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

Is he without power, that's the

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

And I think if you look at

11

the facts of this case where, I mean, actually what

12

happened at the end of the proofs was the attorney made a

13

motion saying that the defendant in this case had not been

14

tied to the conspiracy, but just asked that the statements

15

be dismissed and didn't ask for, you know, a Rule 29

17

to how effective that counsel was.

QUESTION:

I mean, obviously --

Well, one could also say that the

19

district judge had a change of heart about the new trial

20

only when he found out what the sentence was going to be.

21

MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

Well, but I don't think the

Mr. Christopherson, I understood that

you would answer Justice Stevens' question by saying yes,

QUESTION:

1

Well, what do we do in the case in

2

which there is a rule which specifically addresses it, and

3

let's assume for the sake of argument that you lose on the

4

first point and we say 7 days means 7 days, and that's it,

and whatever the judge can do, he can't do anything

6

outside of 7 days, and so we're in the situation that we

are in this case.
Do you take the position that the -- that when

9

there is a direct conflict between the purported act based

10

on inherent authority, and the rule which would limit the

2

are the cases which have dealt with issues where, for

3

example, prisoners in the Houston v. Lack case were unable

4

to timely file their notices.

5

QUESTION:

But interesting, in that case the

court came up with a rule when you deposit the paper with

7

the jailer, so it wasn't something that for one judge it's

9 days, for another judge -- there was -- the court came

9

up with a rule.

10
11

It may have been different from the rule

that was written into the Federal Rules.
MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

It was different than what

12

was written in the Federal Rule, and of course' then the

3

Federal Rule was changed to conform with that decision.

4

QUESTION:

Yes, but in Houston v. Lack, the

5

Court did not rely on some inherent power of the judge to

ignore the rule.

7

was how it reached the result it did in Houston v. Lack,

8

so I don't think you have a lot of support in our cases,

inherent power of the judge, no matter what the rule says.

If that's the ruling of

is a defendant's made or renewed motion, so now you have a

rule which is silent.

I think when the rule is silent -- I mean, you

can make the argument either way, and so if you look to --

18

I think you have to look to Rule 2, which talks about

interpreting the rule in fairness to the administration of

justice and to avoid undue delay and undue cost and,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL A. ENGELMAYER

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

5

7

MR. ENGELMAYER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(c)

8

provides that a motion for judgment of acquittal may be

9

made or renewed within 7 days after the jury is discharged

10

or within such further time as the Court may fix during

11

the 7-day period.

12

Our position is that when a defendant makes a

13

judgment, motion for judgment of acquittal outside that

14

time limit, as occurred in this case, the district court

15

lacks authority to grant that motion.

16

We also take the position that the district

17

court's authority to enter a judgment of acquittal on its

18

own motion is constrained by that same time limit.

IS

To begin with, the mandatory nature of the

20

Rule 29(c) time limit is dictated, in our view, by the

21

plain language of Rule 45(b), which this Court took up in

22

United States v. Robinson.

23

Rule 45(b) allows district courts to enlarge

24

The evidence

I've never seen so many claims come up that make

that, all the time, and often the trials are very

12

complicated, and often they involve unbelievable numbers

13

of witnesses on conspiracy, and this person says this, the

14

other one says that, and is what the Government's position

15

now is that in the courts of appeals, and indeed, in

16

district courts on habeas, that it -- the fact that the

17

person didn't make the motion in the trial court for a

18

directed verdict for acquittal is irrelevant.

19

Basically, the courts of appeals and the

20

district courts are supposed to go through all those

21

records and review the same way they would do it if, in

22

fact, at the trial court level somebody had made a motion

23

for a directed verdict and the district judge had had a

clear error to introduce certain testimony, and without

2

that testimony the verdict simply can't stand?

3
4

MR. ENGELMAYER:
steps.

Let me address that in two

First of all, the claim in this case is wrong.

5

The citation that petitioner has referred to in

6

his claim that is new law is a Sentencing Guidelines case

7

called Jenkins.

8

goes about determining what quantity of drugs are

9

attributable to a defendant for calculating mandatory

10

11

It simply addresses the issue of how one

minimums.
It has nothing to do with sufficiency, and I

12

think that's clear from the oral discussion, which is

13

reprinted in the joint appendix, that the district court

14

goes through.

15

But more generally, even if there is a change of

16

law outside the time limit set by Rule 29(c), the rule

17

simply does not authorize a district court to revisit the

18

issue, to open up the issue on sufficiency outside that

19

time limit.

20

Now, there is a different recourse in the rules.

21

Under Rule 48(a), the Government is authorized to move to

22

dismiss an indictment, and after trial has commenced that

23

must be with the consent of the defendant.

24
25

If, let us say, a intervening Supreme Court
decision came down that made clear that under new

standards the evidence at trial was clearly insufficient,

2

a decision like McNalley or Ratzlaf, or something like

3

that, the Government would be perfectly free, and a

4

responsible Government hopefully would take action --

5

QUESTION:

Well, and even if it didn't, the new

6

law would certainly have to be applied by the court of

7

appeals on appeal, wouldn't it, in deciding whether the

8

case should have ever gone to the jury?

9

MR. ENGELMAYER:

There actually is a circuit

10

split, Justice Scalia, where the issue is not raised below

11

as to which law to apply under a plain error standard, but

12

where it was preserved, there's no question that you would

13

be applying the new law.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Engelmayer, I think Justice

15

Breyer and I may disagree, and I'd be interested to know

16

the Government's position as to whether the district

17

judge, in passing on a motion for a new trial, applies the

18

same standard as the court of -- or, not a motion for a

19

new trial, a motion for judgment of acquittal.

20

It's my opinion that a district judge passing on

21

a motion for judgment of acquittal applies exactly the

22

same standard as the court of appeals.

23

insufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict.

24

Now, is that the Government's position, or do

3

you agree that the district court somehow makes

credibility determinations in passing on a motion for

position.

8

verdict, and that is under the Jackson v. Virginia

9

standard that all credibility findings must be construed

10

The only deference that is due is to the jury's

in the light most favorable to the verdict.
I think as a practical matter a defendant

11
12

obviously gets a real advantage if his counsel is savvy

13

enough to make an intelligent motion in the district

14

court.

15

QUESTION:

I guess my question does not turn on

16

credibility or not credibility.

17

things are incredibly complicated, very often, and the

18

trial judge as a practical matter is in a far better

19

position, often, to decide what's going on than a court of

20

appeals.

21

I just notice these

Now, maybe the legal standard written down in

22

terms of credibility would sound the same, but it doesn't

23

seem to me in practice that it's the same, in that judges

24

normally at an appeals court level know they haven't heard

25

all the evidence.

1

2

3

Now that seems to me to make a difference.

Now,

maybe you're saying it doesn't make a difference.
MR. ENGELMAYER:

Well, I think what I'm saying

4

in the same practical spirit in which your question was

5

phrased is that it does, as a practical matter, make it

6

a -- put the defendant on much more of an uphill road in

7

order to establish insufficiency in the court of appeals

8

than in the district court, and that is the price the

9

defendant pays for not having made the motion.

10

If the district court, however, out of time

11

suddenly has the revelation that maybe there was something

2

insufficient about the evidence, I suppose there's nothing

3

that would prevent the district court from making those

4

views known, perhaps in the context of granting bail

5

pending appeal, or something like that.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Engelmayer, may I ask you about

7

the possibility of a theoretical difference, and I mean, I

8

understand your answer to say that there isn't this

9

difference, but wouldn't it be possible for the district

20

judge, ruling on a motion made within the time, to say,

21

no - - the conviction depends upon acceptance of the

22

testimony of X.

23

No reasonable jury could find X credible on the

24

crucial evidence, and therefore I will enter a judgment of

25

acquittal, or -- yes -- whereas a court of appeals could

1

not make that credibility determination, as I understand

2

it.

3

Isn't that theoretical difference possible?

4

MR. ENGELMAYER:

I don't think so.

I think it

5

is conceivable that in a sufficiency analysis one might,

6

in a very odd case, turn to the credibility of a witness,

7

but only based on objective facts at trial.

8

9

For example, if a witness is contradicted by a
videotape, let us say, that is something that the court of

10

appeals perhaps would be able to review, and a district

11

court would be in the same position, but in the more

12

impressionistic sense that we think of credibility, I

13

don't think the district court has any more discretion

14

than the court of appeals to turn to that issue.

15

QUESTION:

Yes.

16

QUESTION:

May I ask you to return before the

17

time expires to my hypothetical?

18

where it is that you find authority in the rule for the

19

judge to do what you say he obviously has the power to do.

20

MR. ENGELMAYER:

Right.

I still don't understand

Rule 29(c) attaches a

that the term motion, not being subject in either of those

court was to have inherent sua sponte authority that

22

lasted after the defendant's right to move had expired,

you would have this undesirable consequence of a defendant

MR. ENGELMAYER:

The double

Oh, I --

-- with a judgment of acquittal.
I certainly agree with that.

My point was more that the way that the Federal Rules, and

10

29, 33, and 34 and 35 are something of a package under

11

45(b), the way they choose to limit who may make a motion

12

is, to the defendant is to add after the expression, on

13

motion of a defendant -- that was what was added in 1966.

14

QUESTION:

Yes, but I -- that's a very

15

interesting argument, but I don't see how it doesn't work

16

against you, because in this case there is no double

17

jeopardy problem, and so the court's power to enter the

18

acquittal should be greater, and the rules may recognize

19

that, arguably, by this silence.
MR. ENGELMAYER:

20

And the court's powers are

21

greater, Justice Kennedy, in that, unlike in the new trial

22

context the court does, in our view, under 29(c) have the

23

power to order a judgment of acquittal following the

24

verdict, even if the defendant has not asked for that

25

relief.

QUESTION:

Yes.

2

MR. ENGELMAYER:

It just so happens, though that

that, the time limit that the court is constrained by is

the same 7-day, unless timely extended, time limit that

5

the defendant is constrained by in Rule 29(c) .

served by the rule -QUESTION:

Before you do that, why is it

constrained by the same -- I mean, it's not -- it isn't

10

granted by (c), and why is it constrained by (c), the time

11

in which the judge can act on his own?

12

MR. ENGELMAYER:

If one construes in (c) the

3

expression, a motion for judgment of acquittal, to include

4

a motion for judgment of acquittal on the court's own --

5

on the court's initiative, which is a type of motion that

6

is adverted to in (a), then such a motion on the court's

7

own initiative must be made with 7 days after the jury is

8

discharged, or within time extended afterwards.

So, for example, the court might say several

days after a verdict, I'm troubled, I don't -- I'm not

is something that is going to have to be taken up either,

QUESTION:

6

What is the scope of the district

7

judge's authority on a postverdict motion?

8

there's a 2255 application made to this same district

judge.

10

MR. ENGELMAYER:

Say a -- say

The district judge

11

realistically, because of the theory of plain error which

12

I've set out earlier, and we're not aware, by the way, of

3

any court of appeals that has ever held that the plain

4

error standard was decisive on a sufficiency claim that

5

the nature of the standard mattered, realistically a

6

district court will almost never have to get to a 2255

7

motion, because one way or the other, plain error analysis

8

on the sufficiency question on direct appeal should

dispose of it.

20

In theory --

QUESTION:

If I'm right, though, that that

21

failed here, that the Sixth Circuit considered -- there

22

wasn't only one question raised on the appeal from the

24

Circuit instruction to sentence, that they had considered

all questions relating to the trial?

MR. ENGELMAYER:

1

Not in this case.

Remember

2

that the defendant in this case had not yet been sentenced

3

and as a result, after the defendant would be sentenced

4

after the remand, the defendant would have the right to

5

file time -QUESTION:

6

But let's assume the Sixth Circuit

7

affirmed, didn't find any plain error, so there's another

8

appeal after the sentence --

9

MR. ENGELMAYER:
QUESTION:

10
11
12

Right.

-- and then we're left with what,

2255?
MR. ENGELMAYER:

And the 2255 would fail under

13

any theory, because sufficiency will have been raised and

14

lost in the court of appeals, and ineffective assistance

15

of counsel would fail to show prejudice because there

16

would be a legal sufficiency, and therefore any timing

17

mess-up by the lawyer would have been, in effect, harmless

18

error, so --

19

QUESTION:

I thought you had raised those two

20

possibilities as discrete, but now you're saying if you

21

lose one, if you lose the plain error review on the

22

circuit, you can forget the 2255.

23

MR. ENGELMAYER:

Except in the highly

24

exceptional case, Justice Ginsburg, where the existence of

25

reasonable doubt was so much in equipoise that maybe the
54

1

plain error standard was dispositive, and therefore,

2

except in that situation there would be -- it would be

3

duplicative to raise an ineffective assistance claim.

4

In that rare situation, I suppose, a defendant

5

could come back and say, but for the plain error standard,

6

I would have prevailed on appeal, and it was only because

7

of my counsel's lapse that the plain error standard wound

8

up being used on appeal, ergo I should have a good

9

ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.

I really don't

10

think that that -- we're ever going to get to that stage

11

in this case or others like it.

12

Finally, it's just important just to point out

13

the purposes of this rule, that they're to expedite the

14

termination of district court review to make sure that,

15

for example, the -- that there aren't eleventh hour

16

motions made raising sufficiency just before sentencing

17

that puts off sentencing.

18

It helps to ensure that, if the district court

19

is going to be tossing out a conviction based on

20

insufficiency, that that be done sufficiently in advance

21

of sentencing that the court, the probation office, the

22

defendant, and the prosecutor don't waste time going

23

through the needless exercise of preparing for sentencing.

24
25

barrier, the 7-day barrier applying to the district court

happened in this case the motion was filed,

one time?
MR. CHRISTOPHERSON:

2

He denied the motion in

3

August and, again, in the transcript he said, I agonized

4

and wrote two separate opinions, and then when it came the

5

day for sentencing he called the counsel in and on the

6

record explained that he had changed his mind.

7

The other point I'd like to raise is I think, in

8

looking at the rule, this Court has to look at what rule

9

is going to be used to construe that rule, and one point

10

I'd like to make to the court is that the day that Houston

11

v. Lack was decided this Court also decided the Torres

12

case.

13

In that case the Court indicated that in

14

construing the rules they should be construed liberally

15

with a view that cases should be decided on their merits

16

as opposed to on procedure, and I think if you use that

17

type of analysis that the majority used in the Torres

18

case, apply it to Rule 29, that under these facts the

19

court should have the power to consider the issue of

20

insufficiency of the evidence prior to the time of

21

sentencing.

22

Thank you.
