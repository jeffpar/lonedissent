We'll hear argument

Is that the correct pronunciation of your

client's name, Mr. Robbins?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE S. ROBBINS

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

13
14
15

MR. ROBBINS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
On October 24, 1989, Federal prosecutors in

16

Reno, Nevada commenced a civil forfeiture action against

17

some $5-1/2 million in real and personal property owned by

18

petitioner Brian Degen and his wife, Karen.

19

As the forfeiture statutes permit, Mr. Degen

20

filed a claim for the property.

In it, he denied that the

21

property was either the proceeds or instrumentalities of

22

narcotics violations.

23

defenses, including that the forfeiture action was time-

24

barred and that it rested on an ex post facto application

25

of the forfeiture laws.

He also asserted a range of legal

(800) FOR DEPO

On the Government's motion, however, the

1

2

district court struck Mr. Degen's claim for the property.

3

The court ruled that because Mr. Degen, a dual Swiss and

4

American citizen, had not traveled to the United States to

5

stand trial in a criminal case that had been brought

6

against him, he was a fugitive, and as a fugitive from the

7

criminal case, he was therefore disentitled, in the

8

vernacular, from contesting the civil forfeiture of his

9

property.

10

The district court therefore entered a judgment

11

against Mr. Degen for the full amount of the Government's

12

claim, some $5-1/2 million of property, and the Court of

13

Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.

14

Our central submission this morning is that

15

Federal courts and Federal judges do not have the

16

authority to do this.

17

application of the fugitive disentitlement doctrine cannot

18

be squared with this Court's disentitlement cases, it

19

cannot be squared with due process, and it cannot be

20

squared, most importantly, with the limitations that this

21

Court has always recognized on the scope of the inherent

22

powers of the Federal courts.

23

QUESTION:

To the contrary, this extraordinary

When you say it cannot be squared

24

with due process, Mr. Robbins, do you mean that if

25

Congress had enacted such a provision it would be

unconstitutional?
MR. ROBBINS:

2

I believe it would.

I believe

3

that Congress would not have authority to pass a statute

4

that has done what the Federal courts in this case have

5

done, although, Justice Scalia, if I might add, it is all

6

the more unlawful when done by Federal courts.

7

QUESTION:

8

wouldn't have that authority?
MR. ROBBINS:

10

What leads you to think that Congress

12

MR. ROBBINS:

QUESTION:

15

I think the reason is

that - -

11

14

Well,

I mean, are you talking about a case?
I'm sorry, Your --

Are you talking about a decision of

this Court that supports that proposition?
MR. ROBBINS:

Well, I -- it's -- I think that

16

the line of authority that supports the proposition is

17

embodied, for example, in McVeigh and in Hovey v. Elliott,

18

where the Court, in deciding that a Court lacked the

19

power, said that not even a legislature could pass such a

20

statute, and therefore it's all the more unconstitutional

21

for Federal courts, or in those cases State courts,

22

exercise that kind of authority.

QUESTION:

Where did your client reside before

he went to Switzerland?
MR. ROBBINS:

He lived in the United States.

1

QUESTION:

And when did he go to Switzerland?

2

MR. ROBBINS:

The record suggests, Mr. Chief

3

Justice, that he went to Switzerland sometime in early

4

1988 .

5
6

QUESTION:

And when was the indictment handed

down?

7

MR. ROBBINS:

8

QUESTION:

9

It was unsealed in October 1989.

If -- supposing the district judge in

this case had made a finding that he left the United

10

States in order to avoid pleading to the indictment, would

11

that make the outcome any different, in your view?

12

MR. ROBBINS:

It would not.

Our position would

13

be that even if he were a fugitive in that sense, which

14

he's not, but even had he been, our position would be

15

exactly the same.

16

the civil forfeiture case would not have the authority to

17

exercise the dispositive sanction of dismissal.

That is to say that a Federal court in

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. ROBBINS:

And that Congress wouldn't?
I think it would be -- I think it

20

would be very difficult to say that Congress could pass a

21

statute that says that the -- that you have no right to

22

defend the forfeiture of property if you have become a

23

fugitive in a criminal case.

24

QUESTION:

25

But again --

And that's so even if you make a

general appearance in the action?

QUESTION:

MR. ROBBINS:

A general appearance in the

Yes.
And the question would again be

the power of Congress -QUESTION:

Again, the powers of Congress under

the Due Process Clause.
Assume that there's a general appearance in the
action but a refusal to make discovery or a refusal to

10

appear because you're a fugitive from justice.

11

the Congress of the United States say, in that case we can

12

take judgment against you?

13

MR. ROBBINS:

Couldn't

Well, again -- my general answer

14

is that when Congress does something, obviously they are

15

not constrained by the limitations on inherent powers.

16

The question that would be presented, Justice Kennedy, in

17

that situation is whether the application of that sanction

18

through the legislative process satisfies the conditions

19

articulated in Hammond Packing on whether there's a

20

sufficient nexus between the violation and the sanction

21

that's been imposed, and it might be --

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Robbins, I thought you were not

23

contesting that as far as the forfeiture is concerned

24

Mr. Degen would have to be treated like any other

25

litigant, so if he didn't show up, say, for a deposition,

1

didn't comply with all the discovery requirements, out he

2

goes .
I thought that you were saying as far as the

3
4

forfeiture proceeding is concerned, he can't have any

5

advantage because of his fugitive status, and if I'm wrong

6

in that, please tell me.

7

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, we are certainly not

8

suggesting, Justice Ginsburg, that he has some special

9

advantage by being -- by virtue of his nonappearance, and

10

so, for example, if there were an appropriate sanction for

11

nonappearance in the forfeiture action, I suppose that if

12

that sanction otherwise comported with the two standards

13

that this Court articulated in Insurance Corporation of

14

Ireland, I suppose he could be appropriately sanctioned,

15

and - -

16

QUESTION:

I thought your case was, he has a

17

right, the right that any litigant would have, to defend

18

the forfeiture proceeding.

19

MR. ROBBINS:

20

QUESTION:

21

Exactly.

He's not stripped of that right

because there's a criminal prosecution against him.

22

MR. ROBBINS:

23

QUESTION:

Exactly.

But as to the forfeiture proceeding,

24

he would have to comply with all the requirements the

25

court would impose on anyone who's contesting a

1

forfeiture.

2

MR. ROBBINS:

That's absolutely correct,

and the

3

only point of departure that I thought I tried to suggest

4

to Your Honor's question is -- insofar as the predicate is

5

that if he didn't show up for a deposition he would be

6

automatically subject to have his claim dismissed,

7

altogether sure that courts can dismiss claims whenever

8

there's any particular violation of a discovery order.

9

The question --

0
11

QUESTION:

It's a civil matter,

though.

I'm not

You

wouldn't argue --

12

MR. ROBBINS:

Exactly.

You know,

the question

3

would be, you know, whether this comports with the due

4

process restrictions on Rule 37 as this Court has

5

articulated them in --

6

QUESTION:

What -- assuming, even apart from any

7

rule,

8

the Government to perfect its forfeiture case, perhaps

9

because the material forfeited was in the possession of

that the failure to show up made it impossible for

20

the defendant,

21

take it you would agree that there would be no due process

22

violation in disentitling the person to defend any

23

further.

24
25

in a case like that,

MR. ROBBINS:

rule or no rule,

I

I think -- I think that's correct,

if I understand the question.

If,

for example, his

1

nonappearance rendered it impossible for the district

2

court in the forfeiture action to proceed, for example by

3

rendering it impossible to have -- you know, to enforce

4

the judgment, or to take control of the race, if you will,

5

then, you know, there's nothing that should separate

6

Mr. Degen from any other litigant.

7

QUESTION:

That --

If the district court were to order

8

him to appear in Nevada for a deposition, could he then be

9

served with criminal process in the criminal case?
MR. ROBBINS:

10

Oh, I think if he were to appear

11

in response to such an order, I have no doubt that he

12

would be immediately served with process in the criminal

3

case.

4

QUESTION:

5

objectionable, in your view?

6

And would that be constitutionally

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, the -- it would raise a

7

question in my mind, Mr. Chief Justice, if it was done for

8

the purpose of securing his appearance, as a way of sort

9

of going around the extradition case.

20

QUESTION:

Well, suppose it wasn't.

Suppose the

21

district judge says, we do have these foreign claimants,

22

and I always require them to come to Reno, or Las Vegas,

23

and give their depositions.

24
25

MR. ROBBINS:
the answer is this.

Well, Your Honor, that -- I think

If we were faced with that case,

1

which, of course, we're not --he was not sanctioned for

2

that reason.

3

reason that he didn't come and make an appearance in his

4

criminal case.

He was sanctioned for the quite different

5

But had he been sanctioned for that, Mr. Chief

6

Justice, I think it would raise two questions, one about

7

the formulation of the rule, and one about the formulation

8

of the sanction.

9

The formulation of the rule would be, can a

10

district judge say that in all civil forfeiture actions

11

every claimant must show up in person?

12

raise a question, which I'm not prepared to sort of give a

I think that would

3

complete answer to, but I think it would raise a question

4

as to whether a district court would be in effect

5

announcing that the rules provided by Congress, including

6

for foreign depositions and telephonic depositions, shall

7

be just set aside, and that no discretion shall be

8

exercised.

9

QUESTION:

We've said that that's okay in civil

20

matters, where the reason the person doesn't want to

21

appear generally is that he will be served in other civil

22

cases.

23

you make a general appearance or you do not appear at all.

We've said it's perfectly okay for a State to say,

24

MR. ROBBINS:

25

QUESTION:

I think that that --

I would think that it's a lot easier
11

1

to say it for the criminal case.

2

State is much greater.

3

MR. ROBBINS:

The interest of the

I -- well, again, I think the

4

interest of the State is greater, but the question that I

5

was intending to answer is whether a court could say that

6

notwithstanding Rules 28(b) on foreign depositions and

7

Rule 30(b)(7) on telephonic depositions, I'm just not --

8

the judge would be saying in all civil forfeiture actions

9

I'm not going to consider those --

10

QUESTION:

Well, supposing the district court

11

said, I don't require all civil forfeiture defendants to

12

come to Las Vegas, but I'm going to require you to come to

13

Las Vegas, because I'm exercising my discretion and that's

14

the way I choose to exercise it.

15

MR. ROBBINS:

I think it is possible that if

16

circumstances warranted that and the judge, you know, gave

17

reasons that satisfy a reviewing court that this was an

18

appropriate exercise of discretion that might be done, but

19

then the further question, if I might, as to whether the

20

violation of that order gives -- justifies the sanction,

21

the dispositive sanction of dismissal --

22

23

QUESTION:

You sound as though your client might

be planning to violate such an order.

24

MR. ROBBINS:

25

(Laughter.)

No.

1

MR. ROBBINS:

And the question, of course, has

2

not been presented, since he's obeyed every order in the

3

civil case that's been pressed on him, and this district

4

judge, unlike the hypothetical district judge that the

5

question presupposes, has ordered foreign depositions in

6

the case of Karen Degen, my client's wife.

7

QUESTION:

In your -- I take it for pure

8

purposes we could consider this as a case in which the

9

defendant is happy to send his lawyers, he's happy to

10

comply with every order.

What he'd like to do is send in

11

one piece of paper, which piece of paper would be

12

absolutely conclusive in his favor, and the judge says,

13

I'm sorry, I won't look at the paper.

14

here, you lose, period.

15

MR. ROBBINS:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. ROBBINS:

18

more than that, Justice Breyer.

this other case --

QUESTION:

Since you're not

Since --

Is that right?
Since you're -- and actually, it's

Yes.

Since you're not here in

Since you're not here in the

other case, you lose.
Now, we're used to doing that in an appeal

23

where, after sentencing, for example, the defendant runs

24

away, and you concede we can do that there.

25

MR. ROBBINS:

No question.

1

2

You can say, we won't look at your

paper, we won't look at the brief, you lose.

3

MR. ROBBINS:

4

QUESTION:

5

Yes, but that --

All right.

Now, what line do you

draw?
MR. ROBBINS:

6

Well, I draw exactly the line that

7

this Court has drawn in that exact -- in those very cases.

8

The line -- and it cuts across several factors that

9

distinguish the facts of this case from that line of

10

cases.
In the first place, Justice Breyer, those are

11
12

cases in which there is no underlying constitutional right

13

that's been abrogated.

14

QUESTION:

There's no --

When I say, what line are you

15

drawing, after all, there are a lot of intermediate cases.

He runs away before sentencing.

17

sentence him?

18
19
20

MR. ROBBINS:
is yes.

Can the judge then

I believe that the answer to that

That's exactly what -QUESTION:

If, in fact, the judge wants to levy

21

a fine, and he wants to produce one piece of paper which

22

will show he has no money, does the judge have to look at

23

that piece of paper?

24
25

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, again, these are cases in

which the sanction is being imposed in the very proceeding

in which the
QUESTION:

2

No, I'm asking you for your -- I

3

mean, you're absolutely right that's where I'm driving.

4

What I want to see is what's your line.

5

You agree, I take it, the judge doesn't have to

6

look at the piece of paper when he ran away before appeal.

7

The judge doesn't have to look at the piece of paper when

8

he runs away before he's being fined at sentencing.

9

you say the judge does have to look at the piece of paper

10

when it's a forfeiture of property, and what's the

11

distinction?
MR. ROBBINS:

12

But

Well, one distinction is that it

13

doesn't turn so much on the forfeiture of property as it

14

does on the fact that there are two different proceedings,

15

and in the forfeiture proceeding there is no showing that

16

the fugitivity has any impact, has had any impact on the

17

process of the forfeiture court, which is, of course,

18

exactly the distinction that persuaded this court in

19

Ortega-Rodriguez to draw the line where it did.
We're insisting on exactly the same line and,

20
21

indeed, the use of the disentitlement doctrine in this

22

setting in my view is vastly more dramatic.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Robbins, may I ask you a

24

question?

MR. ROBBINS:

3

I've heard such an argument may be

made.

4

QUESTION:

5

(Laughter.)

6

QUESTION:

You've heard such an argument.

Well, if the Constitution commands

7

these proceedings be treated as one, how can you

8

consistently argue in this case that we must treat them as

9

totally separate --

10

MR. ROBBINS:

11

QUESTION:

Well --

-- which is the heart of your

12

argument, that we should ignore the criminal case and just

13

look at what can be done in the civil case?

14

MR. ROBBINS:

15

separate proceedings, of course.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Well, I contend that they are

And it's constitutionally permissible

for us to treat them as separate proceedings.
MR. ROBBINS:

Well, I think it is

19

constitutionally permissible to treat them as separate

20

proceedings and, indeed, they are separate proceedings,

21

but even --

22

QUESTION:

Even if not, you would say that if

23

they are brought as separate proceedings they have to be

24

treated as separate proceedings.

QUESTION:

That's not a very irrational

position, is it?
MR. ROBBINS:

And the inquiry would -- and the

inquiry would still be, has the fugitivity in case one

affected the proceedings in case two, and my general

9

purposes -- none of the purposes -- that this Court

10
11

identified in Ortega-Rodriguez.
What the Government wants in order to sustain

12

this forfeiture is for the Court to completely reformulate

13

the doctrine of fugitive disentitlement so that it no

14

longer matters whether the claimant has a dispositive

15

motion that doesn't even require his presence, or even his

16

testimony, so that it doesn't even matter if the

17

Government has probable cause, so that it doesn't even

18

matter whether there's venue in this court, so that the

19

only thing that matters is that he hasn't shown up to face

20

parallel criminal charges.

Mr. Robbins, in answer to Justice

Scalia's question about the special or general appearance,

the Federal side if the property is in the custody of the

2

court, you could make a limited appearance and say, I'm

3

coming in for purposes of defending my property, but

4

nothing else that I own is going to be subject to the

5

court's authority.
I thought that's -- on the Federal side, that

6

7

has been the Federal practice, whatever the Texas rule may

8

be.

9

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, I'm actually not certain

10

whether Mr. Degen could have entered a limited appearance.

11

In this particular case, he hired a lawyer to contest the

12

forfeiture --

13

QUESTION:

Well, that's what a limited

14

appearance is.

15

the only thing that's going to be subject to the judgment

16

is the property.

17

I'm there, I'm fighting out the case, but

MR. ROBBINS:

Correct, which is, of course, the

18

only thing that can be subject to the forfeiture judgment.

19

The forfeiture court has not seized jurisdiction over

20

Mr. Degen for purposes of imposing, you know, a

21

dispositive sanction on him other than in the course of

22

the litigation were he to violate a court order.

23

QUESTION:

And I guess the actual parallel in

24

the State civil case anyway would not be whether you

are relevant to that suit, but rather, I guess the

2

parallel would be a State that says if you make even a

3

special appearance in one case you are liable to being

4

sued in separate cases.

5

that.

6

MR. ROBBINS:

I don't know any case that does

Well, exactly, and actually this

7

is actually to me a more dramatic example of that for the

8

following reason.

9

dispositively sanctioned, not because of something he did

Mr. Degen has been sanctioned, indeed

10

in the criminal case, but for his failure to come to the

11

United States, an act over which the court in the criminal

12

case lacks jurisdiction.

3

In a sense, this is the use of an inherent power

4

to sanction someone in case one because of something that

5

he failed to do outside the courtroom in case two, and I'd

6

like to suggest, with all due respect, that there is no

7

authority certainly in any of this Court's cases for this

8

kind of a use of an inherent power of a court.

I think it is permissible, and

Just as this Court pointed out in Societe

that doesn't appear, but one of them is not that you

dispositively sanction him, take his property, give him no

hasn't shown up.

appellate proceedings of the same exact case, you couldn't

3

apply the disentitlement doctrine in that way.

4

QUESTION:

Well, but that had to do with the

5

fact that the appellate proceedings did not relate to the

the dignity of the same court, and therefore couldn't be

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, it is the same court, but

aware of no authority, the Government cites no authority

the underlying cause of action may be, that a sanction can

be imposed in case one because of case two, particularly,

let me add, for conduct that is not unlawful in any way.

9

It bears mention that although Mr. Degen's

failure to come to the United States is doubtless

11

frustrating to the United States Attorney in Reno, Nevada,

12

to the Department of Justice, and to Judge Reed sitting in

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA

5

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

6

7

MR. ESTRADA:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

8

It is undisputed that this civil forfeiture

9

action is directly related to a criminal case that is

10

pending in the same district courthouse against Degen, and

11

that Degen refused to appear to stand trial on the

12

criminal charges.

13

For two reasons, the court of appeals correctly

14

held that a claimant in Degen's situation may be

15

disentitled from contesting the civil forfeiture action.

16

First and foremost a civil claimant's participation in the

17

civil forfeiture action fundamentally threatens the

18

integrity of the criminal case.

19

Second, the claimant's --

20

QUESTION:

21
22

23
24
25

You say the defendant's participation

in the civil forfeiture threatens the criminal case?
MR. ESTRADA:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and that

is, in fact, our principal argument here.
Our argument starts from the premise that courts
always have had the inherent authority to protect against

1

the abuse of their processes by a litigant, and that is

2

precisely what the rule at issue here does.

3

If a civil claimant is allowed to participate in

4

a civil forfeiture action while at the same time he

5

refuses to stand trial on a criminal case that is based on

6

the identical event, he may then use the very broad civil

7

discovery rules that --to circumvent the very well

8

settled and strict restrictions on criminal discovery.

9
10
11

QUESTION:

But couldn't that be dealt with by a

judge administering the civil discovery rules?
MR. ESTRADA:

That is not true, Mr. Chief

12

Justice, with respect, and in order to understand why, it

3

is useful to note why it is that we have limited criminal

4

discovery in our society.

5

criminal discovery exist because long experience has

6

taught Congress and the courts that early disclosure of

the Government's case in a criminal prosecution often

8

leads to contrived defense testimony --

QUESTION:

possible even if he appeared in the criminal case, that he

9

the result would have been that we couldn't get any

he's in Switzerland, we think that it is a reasonable

exercise of the court's authority to have a very simple

So what has the Government lost?

made a prima facie showing which on its face entitles us

with how to deal with someone who is a fugitive in a

2

foreign country, so that there's no negative implication

3

that that is an exclusive remedy.

4

The second point, which I think is more

5

important, is that the fact that Congress has dealt with

6

an aspect of the issues that come up with cases when cases

7

are related does not mean that the court ceases to have a

8

very strong interest in keeping parties from abusing its

9

processes, and that's what is at issue here.

11

Well, yes, there is, Mr. Chief

MR. ESTRADA:

application of the sanction at issue here.

sanction being imposed is an exercise of the power of the

10

We are not saying, for

What we are saying is that it is a proper use of

striking difference between this and Molinaro, where the

It's in the

points being raised by your question, as I understand it,

One is why can't we wait, and the other

13

the civil forfeiture action for supporting this rule.

14

One, of course, is the fact that he has shown to

the court that he intends to play games with the court and

16

maybe their answer is let's wait and see if he does it

17

some more, but even -- even accepting that that would be

18

an acceptable answer, it is not an acceptable answer to

19

the more fundamental problem that we are identifying,

20

which is that by getting discovery and allowing -- and

21

being allowed to litigate the civil forfeiture action, he

22

is circumventing the criminal discovery rules.

Those rules reflect a very strong public policy
that cannot be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.

15

that it is not right because it is possible that he could

2

involve disclosing the Government's case?

3

MR. ESTRADA:

No, I am not saying that.

What I

4

am saying is there are enough circumstances in the class

5

of cases to warrant the adoption of a general rule while

6

recognizing that the rule can have exceptions for specific

7

cases being, in its nature, discretionary.

QUESTION:

Well, why in the example that you

just gave does that example support you?

Why, in the case

10

in which the Government knows because of its criminal

11

evidence the property came from some other source than

12

inheritance, couldn't the Government simply go to the

13

court and say, we have evidence to rebut?

itself, and therefore you in fact ought to stay the

We will make a

money, but --

MR. ESTRADA:

QUESTION:

And we have a legal right to it.

But the fact is, in each instance

21

what it comes down to is not your incapacity to defend

22

your own position, and not your incapacity, in effect, to

23

meet the evidentiary position that you feel is unfairly

24

being foisted upon you, but rather, it comes down in every

25

instance to the fact that you want the property now rather

2

proceedings could be dealt with in an orderly fashion.

3
4

So it seems to me that it all boils down to kind
of a time-money argument.

5

MR. ESTRADA:

Well, it boils down to the fact

6

that under the act of Congress that we have at issue here,

7

we have a right to the money, and that there is no

8

foreseeable time in the future at which the two

9

proceedings can be dealt with in an orderly fashion.
QUESTION:

But you don't hold the same in

respect to misrepresentation cases, restitution cases,

13

might have civil remedies.

you have first to face the criminal charges, and the

district court was quite clear -- and, in fact, I could

10

point the Court to the top of page 26a of the pet app.
The court made it quite clear that he would be

Justice Souter, which is that we can readily concede for

that we should strive to accommodate in framing rules for

MR. ESTRADA:

obstruction of justice and witness intimidation and

being as strict as they are, and they do reflect a public

effectively be controlled on a case-by-case basis.
I mean, we cannot take a wait-and-see attitude

to see whether someone will attempt obstruction of justice

So this doesn't sound like it's a

I think that it would be fair to

I don't --

at all?

9

MR. ESTRADA:

I don't think so.

From our

point of view the case really does involve the very narrow

question of the power of the civil court to make sure that

someone will not misuse it to gain an unfair tactical

advantage.

And it is, as the district court framed it, a

limited rule, and as the court of appeals recognized, a

16

rule that allows for the exercise of discretion in

specific cases, this not being one of them, because

18

Mr. Degen waived any right to discretionary claims in the

the funds in the court, what can't it do that it could do

2

if the forfeiture had gone through as you're urging?
MR. ESTRADA:

3

Well, under the view of the other

4

side, we can't get the funds into the U.S. Treasury where

5

we think they belong.

MR. ESTRADA:

But you can put them in an interest-

Ginsburg?

And to wait -- what, Justice

I mean, there is no reasonable indication that

10

he will ever come to this country to face the criminal

11

charges, so what we're saying is that we're going to put

12

the money in a bank where the Government has no access to

13

it, even though it has made a showing --

Yes.

My question is, that's -- is there

entitled to it now, and saying we've got the principal in

2

the bank and we're getting interest on it, and so we're

3

getting the time value, we're getting -- we're not getting

4

the principal, but we're getting the interest?

5

MR. ESTRADA:

I understand the point of your

6

question, and I would say that I suppose that is a form of

7

a compromise that has as much grounding in the court's

8

inherent authority as the more easily manageable rule that

9

we have here, and since we are not the people at fault,

10

and since by statute we are also entitled to the

11

principal, it seems to me that as between the choice of

12

two reasonable rules that accomplish a purpose, we're

13

entitled to that one that gives us our statutory rights.

14
15
16
17

QUESTION:

Yes, but you're entitled to it if you

can prove it, but you want to get it without proving it.
MR. ESTRADA:

We have proven our entitlement to

the money --

18

QUESTION:

Well --

19

MR. ESTRADA:

-- and all we're looking to see is

20

that in disputing our showing the other party doesn't put

21

us to the choice of giving up our statutory entitlement or

22

giving up the very strong public interest in the integrity

23

of a criminal prosecution.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE S. ROBBINS

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

MR. ROBBINS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

6

This case is a very good illustration for why

7

what this Court called the blunderbuss of dismissal is

8

inappropriate as way of solving the problem that the

9

Government is concerned about.
If disentitlement is to be taken at the

10
11

threshold in order to protect against the possibility that

12

there may be discovery in the civil case that provides a

13

window into the criminal case, district courts can do

14

that,

15

applying Rule 26(c)

16

issue protective orders.

17

and they do it of every day of every week by
of the Rules of Civil Procedure,

This case, however,

and

is different, because in

18

this case the Federal prosecutor said to the district

19

judge in an argument, made and reproduced on page 6a of

20

the appendix to our brief,

21

the forfeiture proceedings one minute longer in deference

22

to the criminal case precisely because the cat was out of

23

the bag in the criminal case.

24
25

that there was no need to stay

There was no need to protect against the
disclosure of witnesses, no need to protect against the

1

disclosure of any evidence, and in response to the

2

prosecutor's argument, the district court said, fine, you

3

can go ahead and take all the depositions you want --

4

Karen Degen, the petitioner's wife, and in an order that's

5

reflected in the minutes of the February 1, 1993

6

transcript.

7

In short, this district judge concluded that no

8

protective order was appropriate precisely because there

9

was nothing to protect against.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. ROBBINS:

12

13
14
15
16
17

Is Karen Degen in the United States?
She is not.

She is living with

her husband and their children in Switzerland.
QUESTION:

So a discovery order was entered

against her but not against Brian?
MR. ROBBINS:

Discovery was issued in her favor,

but not in Mr. Degen's favor, that's correct, Your Honor.
The point here is the wonderful irony about this

18

argument is it bears no -- you know, no coherent

19

relationship to the facts of this case, and precisely to

20

avoid a problem that the prosecutor said was not

21

presented, Mr. Degen is to be disentitled, dispositively

22

sanctioned for conduct that the court has no jurisdiction

23

even in the action in which he is a putative fugitive, to

24

sanction him for.

25

Let me also get rid of one other red herring.

QUESTION:

1

In that same exchange, what is the

2

argument when you said, I would point out, Your Honor,

3

that Mr. Degen is no longer a claimant in this case, he's

4

merely a witness?

5

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, he'd already been

6

disentitled, so what they were saying is, you know, don't

7

pay any attention to the need to get his evidence because

8

you've already knocked him out of the box, and to the

9

extent that Karen is relying on his unavailability as a

10

reason to extend the summary judgment proceedings, you

11

shouldn't credit his -- the need for his testimony.

12

The other red herring I'd like to deal with is

13

the argument that the Government has already established

14

its right to this money.

15

right to the seizure of this money and this property

16

through a prima facie showing, to be sure, but if I can be

17

indulged one other Latinism, it's also completely ex

18

parte.

19

What it has established is its

They went into court with a complaint and an

20

affidavit that, you know, to my mind barely shows probable

21

cause to believe any of the property was in fact used in

22

violation of 881(a)(6) and (a)(7), and now they have the

23

money, and now, as the law permits, it's our burden to

24

come into court and overcome that prima facie showing.

25

It's our day in court, the first and only one we get.

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Robbins, what they did, what they

2

showed is comparable to what a plaintiff would have to

3

show in the case of an ordinary civil default judgment,

4

right, make an ex parte showing of the entitlement to

5

money damages.
MR. ROBBINS:

6

Well, that's correct.

They've

7

gone in and shown that they have at least that much of a

8

claim, but the law then permits Mr. Degen to come in and

9

overcome it, and you know, if his unavailability

10

prejudices his capacity to make that showing, then he's so

11

much the worse for it.
We're not asking that he be treated any better.

12

13

We're asking that he be given the rights and opportunities

14

that the law prescribes, and he's being -- you know, he's

15

been foreclosed those opportunities by virtue of conduct

16

that is not against the law, period, and it seems to me

17

that courts can't do it and we --

18
19

QUESTION:

Not against the law, you mean not

criminal?

20

MR. ROBBINS:

21

QUESTION:

22

23

It is not criminal.

I mean --

I question whether it's not against

the law, to fail to appear.
MR. ROBBINS:

Well, Your Honor adverted to

24

whether there isn't some other law inherent in the duty of

25

citizenship.

It may be, although Blackmer does not deal
