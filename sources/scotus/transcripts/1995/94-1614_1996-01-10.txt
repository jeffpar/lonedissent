ORAL ARGUMENT OF DREW S. DAYS, III

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PETITIONERS

12

GENERAL DAYS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The true total population of the United States

13

is unknown and perhaps unknowable.

14

the last 200, the United States Government has been making

15

the best effort possible to count every person it could in

16

compliance with Article I, section 2, clause 3 of the

17

Constitution.

18

At every 10 years for

The 1990 census was no exception.

By all

19

accounts, it was the most well organized and most thorough

20

census in history, accounting for 98.4 percent of the

21

population.

22

1

for 98.4 percent?

2

(Laughter.)

3

GENERAL DAYS:

Well, it's an estimation, Mr.

4

Chief Justice.

5

has recognized that there's no such thing as a 100 percent

6

accurate census, and that's very much bound up in this

7

case.

8

9

It's the best we can.

I think everybody

Since at least 1790, people familiar with the
census-taking process have realized that the process does

10

not locate everyone in the country.

11

George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were convinced that

12

the population of the new nation would be 4 million, and

13

they were not persuaded otherwise when the census came in

14

at 3,890,000.

15

In fact, in 1790

But since at least 1940, the Census Bureau has

16

recognized that there's something called a differential

17

undercount, that is, that certain minority groups, certain

18

racial groups are undercounted, not captured by the census

19

to the same degree as non-minority groups.

20

In this case the responses -- the respondents

21

contend that a statistically adjusted alternative to the

22

actual count should have been adopted by the Secretary of

23

the Commerce because of its alleged superior ability to

24

correct for this differential undercount.

25

The Secretary, however, declined to do that,

1

relying upon the actual count because he believed that it

2

provided a more reliable basis for apportioning

3

Representatives among the States, which after all is the

4

primary purpose of the census, and he did not believe it

5

promised to cure the differential undercount in any event.
The district court upheld the Secretary's

6

7
8

9

decision.
On appeal, however, the court of appeals
determined that the Secretary, by failing to adopt the

10

statistically adjusted alternative, did not make -- and I

11

quote -- a good faith effort to achieve the objective of

12

equal representation for equal population and remanded the

13

case to the district court where the Secretary was going

14

to be required to show that his decision was essential to

15

the achievement of a legitimate governmental objective in

16

order to avoid a declaration of unconstitutionality.

17

We're here seeking reversal of the judgment of

18

the court of appeals on remand with directions of entry of

19

judgment for the petitioners because we submit that the

20

Secretary's decision, following a 200-year tradition, was

21

within the range of options afforded by the Constitution

22

to the Secretary and that what the court of appeals did

23

was failed to show the proper level of deference to the

24

Secretary's decision that he is entitled to in carrying

25

out his responsibilities with respect to the census.

One of the first things that the court of

1

2

appeals failed to do was recognize the broad delegation

3

that the Constitution gives to Congress and Congress in

4

turn gives to the Secretary of Commerce in carrying out

5

the census process.

6

that the Congress shall conduct the census in such a

7

manner as they shall, by law, direct.

8

statute says that the Secretary may conduct the census in

9

such form and content as he may determine.

Article I, section 2, clause 3 says

And Congress by

These are very

10

broad delegations to both the Congress and to the

11

Secretary.
In conformity with his powers under statute and

12

13

under the Constitution, the Secretary of Commerce made

14

three decisions.

15

The first was to put distributive accuracy, that

16

is, the ability to allocate population among the States so

17

that apportionment of Representatives among the States can

18

be carried out in a responsible fashion.

19

use that as the principal focus of his 'analysis in

20

comparing the actual count and the statistically adjusted

21

count.

22

He was going to

His second determination was that the

23

statistical adjustment had to be shown to be superior with

24

respect to distributive accuracy if he were going to use

25

that instead of the actual count.

And the third was, after great deliberation and

1

2

analysis, the Secretary decided that the adjusted count

3

was not superior to the actual count and, therefore, he

4

went with the tradition of 200 years and made the actual

5

count the official census of the United States.
QUESTION:

6

General Days, is it clear or does the

7

Government concede that the use of statistical estimates

8

is permissible, let alone that it's mandatory?

9

I mean, the --

10

GENERAL DAYS:

11

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- text of the Constitution, as I

12

read it, doesn't -- does not say, you know, that there

13

will be an estimate of the number of citizens.

14

about actual enumeration.

15

"census."

16

that could be complied with by Congress saying, well, we

17

think the population of the country overall has increased

18

5 percent and, therefore, we think every State -- chances

19

are every State has increased more or less 5 percent?

20

Close enough for Government work.

It doesn't even use the word

It says actual enumeration.

21

(Laughter.)

22

GENERAL DAYS:

It talks

Do you think that

Could they do that?

Well, Justice Scalia, I think the

23

approach that you were just describing was in fact what

24

the Framers engaged in when they came up with Article I,

25

section 2, clause 3.

It was an estimate.

And the

interpretation of actual enumeration -QUESTION:

2

Because they didn't have an actual

3

enumeration, but what they called for was an actual

4

enumeration.

5

GENERAL DAYS:

That's true, but I think that

6

what the term actual enumeration really suggests is that

7

the Framers wanted to leave open to the Congress and later

8

to the Secretary of Commerce the ability to rely upon

9

developments with respect to nose-counting or head­

10

counting .

11

But I think one can say about the term "actual

12

enumeration" that there has to be a good faith effort by

13

the Congress and by now the Secretary of Commerce to count

14

bodies, to find people.

15

synthetic census I think would be contrary to the

16

constitutional objective.

17

QUESTION:

And, therefore, a totally

19

McLaughlin, was confident that that was an appropriate

way.

He said, if I were free to decide on my own, that's

And he had a footnote, and I wanted to ask you

particularly about that.

improvements in statistical tools, that the use of the

25

adjustment in the next census is probably inevitable.

He said, in light of recent

There must be some planning for the next

4

GENERAL DAYS:

5

QUESTION:

6

Yes, there is, Justice Ginsburg.

So, what is the Government's current

view on that, the propriety of such an adjustment?
GENERAL DAYS:

7

Justice Ginsburg, I don't think

8

any definitive decision has been made, but I don't think

9

that there's any plan to conduct a synthetic census, that

10

is, not going out, as has been the case for 200 years.
QUESTION:

11
12

That wasn't my question.

My question

was after you do that.
GENERAL DAYS:

13

After you do that.

Well,

I think

14

that the plan is to use some sampling, but I don't think

15

that there is any plan to use a PES approach at this

16

point.

17

determinations.

18

I don't think there have been any final

QUESTION:

But there was no sampling in 1990.

19

There was no sampling that was used.

It was the

20

enumeration that was used and then any adjustment was

21

considered not sufficiently reliable.

22

GENERAL DAYS:

That's correct.

23

There is ongoing experimentation and study of

24

various statistical forms of adjustment.

25

Secretary Mosbacher encouraged the Census Bureau, after he

decided in July of 1991, to continue to experiment and do

research on the whole idea of statistically adjusted

censuses.

4

determination at this point to do a PES in the way that

5

was suggested in this lawsuit and is the subject of the

6

debate between the respondents and us.

7

But as I was saying, I don't think there's any

QUESTION:

Do you know what was the source of

8

the trial judge's confidence that the use of an adjustment

9

after the enumeration would be inevitable?
GENERAL DAYS:

10

Well,

I'm not certain, Justice

11

Ginsburg, but I think that after he heard 13 days of

12

testimony from experts of the highest caliber --

13

QUESTION:

He was punchy.

14

(Laughter.)

15

GENERAL DAYS:

He may have been punchy, but I

16

think he also got the sense that the statistical science

17

was moving forward and there would probably be the ability

18

of the Census Bureau to rely more heavily than in the past

19

on this.

20

After all, we have seen a progression in 1980

21

that was an effort by the Census Bureau to look at what

22

was called a post-enumeration program, not a PES but a

23

PEP, and it was decided that that was not sufficiently

24

robust or reliable to use.

25

In 1990 we've moved another step, and I think he

I assume somebody will

Well, that may well be but,

11

Justice Scalia, if we are successful to the extent that we

12

would like to be in this suit, we think there would be a

13

cutting back on challenges to determinations made by the

14

Secretary of Commerce in this regard.

15

If appropriate deference is shown to the

16

Secretary in making these decisions, which are myriad, in

17

coming to a conclusion as to what should be done with

18

respect to the census, what types of adjustments should be

19

made, then I don't think that we have to experience what

20

was the case after the 1980 census in which there were 50

21

lawsuits that -- over 50 lawsuits that weren't concluded

22

until 1987.

23

Our principal point is that there are some types

24

of challenges that deserve to be in court when there's an

25

indication of intentional racial discrimination, when the

Those may well be appropriate matters for courts to

But what the respondents have really invited the

7

courts to do in this case -- and certainly the court of

8

appeals seems to have accepted the invitation -- was for

9

the courts to take sides in a statistical dispute among

10

statisticians and demographers about the propriety of a

11

statistical adjustment.

12

type of dispute that properly belongs in Federal court.

We do not think that that's the

Would you go --

QUESTION:

What do you say is the applicable

standard that we should employ in determining whether the

Secretary's decision is consistent with the constitutional

goal of equal representation?

9

GENERAL DAYS:

Justice O'Connor, certainly

20

that's the way that we would describe the standard.

We

21

think that applying it in this particular case, looking at

22

the three decisions that I just mentioned, insofar as the

23

Secretary is relying upon distributive accuracy as the

24

principal objective, it seems to us that that's consistent

25

with the constitutional language and the goal of equal

representation, that that's what the Constitution has in

2

mind:

3

go about figuring out how Representatives should be

4

allocated among the States, apportioned among the States.

5

That's perfectly consistent with the constitutional

6

language.

7

how does the Congress and the Secretary of Commerce

And when we talk about the need for the

8

statistical adjustment to be superior to the actual count,

9

we think that that is consonant with but not dictated by

10

the text and history of the Constitution.

11

the Secretary of Commerce is doing or was doing in 1990

12

was relying upon experience that the Census Bureau had

13

gained ever since marshals went around in 1790 from door

14

to door asking people who lived in their households.

15

That's what the Secretary was doing.

16

the Secretary has to do precisely what was done in 1790 or

17

1980, but there has to be some approximation and that's

18

exactly what was going on here.

QUESTION:

After all, what

You're saying in response to Justice

O'Connor's question that the Secretary gave an accurate

QUESTION:

I assume your answer would be that

2

there would be rational basis --

3

GENERAL DAYS:

That's right.

Reasonableness,

4

and although the district court here used arbitrary and

5

capricious, we think that that's about as far as the Court

6

should go, but we would argue for a more deferential

7

standard, one that apparently eluded the court of appeals

8

in this case.

9

QUESTION:

Would you take the position that it

10

would satisfy the standard, at least in the absence of the

11

kind of extraordinary circumstances like evidence of

12

intentional undercounting, discrimination, and so on --

13

would you take the position that it would satisfy the

14

standard for the Secretary to take the position as a

15

matter of principle that because all of these adjustment

16

techniques ultimately involve kinds of value choices and

17

are therefore politically manipulable, that it would

18

simply be safer to go with the kind of garden variety

19

actual enumeration, to the exclusion of adjustments as a

20

matter of principle, to avoid the risk of political

manipulation?

Of course, the Secretary could balance off those

considerations, as he did here and went through a list of

eight considerations, and decided, after looking at all of

10
11
12

those, that adjusting was not the right thing to do.

QUESTION:

GENERAL DAYS:

Well, Justice --

-- which he hasn't been in the past.
Well, Justice Scalia, I think

6

that a new Secretary of Commerce came in and found himself

faced with a lawsuit and felt that he would make a good

8

faith effort to try to sort through this and hear what the

9

experts had to say and evaluate it.

And after going

20

through an administrative process that produced

21

pages of administrative record and had 650 comments from

22

outsiders and spent a great deal of time looking at this,

he came to the conclusion that he did.

assimilate wholesale the rigid standards of the Karcher

decision into an evaluation of disputes over the census.

3

QUESTION:

Of the what?

4

GENERAL DAYS:

5

QUESTION:

6

GENERAL DAYS:

The Karcher.

Karcher?
Karcher v. Daggett where, in

7

effect, there has to be mathematical equality.

And as

8

this Court mentioned in Montana, although it may be

9

common-sensical in some ways to seek a precise

10

mathematical test within each State, when you try to apply

11

that same standard to the Nation as a whole, the common

12

sense force of that becomes quite illusory.

13

The court of appeals certainly recognized that

14

there were differences between the problems that the

15

Federal Government faces with respect to the census and

16

those that States confront, but did not give, in our

17

estimation, a proper weight to those considerations.

18

After all, unlike a State, when we're talking

19

about the reapportionment of Congress, 'there are certain

20

constraints, three major ones.

21

one Representative per State.

22

exceeding one Representative for every 30,000 people, and

23

ON BEHALF OF THE STATE PETITIONERS

11

MR. DOYLE:

Thank you, General Days.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The people of the State of Wisconsin stand to

12

lose a seat in Congress to the State of California, which

13

is no longer even pursuing its claim because the City of

14

New York and the other respondents seek to engraft on the

15

Constitution certain statistical procedures about how to

16

take the census over which even statisticians disagree.

17

QUESTION:

Do you agree that the individual

18

voters who claim their districts have been undercounted

19

have standing to bring this suit?

MR. DOYLE:

We do not agree with standing in the

As in Montana and in Franklin

v. Massachusetts, both of those claims were pursued by the

3

States that stood to lose a seat in Congress if it had

been -- if the procedure had been adopted.
In this case, California pursued its claim in

the district court, was -- did not appeal the district

court's ruling against it, and we believe the State of

8

California is bound by that judgment.
QUESTION:

9

Do individual voters then not have

10

the standing because the States necessarily supersede

11

their interests?
MR. DOYLE:

12

In our view, it is in this case the

13

States' interest and the individual voter does not have

14

the standing.

15

But let me emphasize in this case California's

16

case was brought State ex rel. for the people of the State

of California by the Attorney General of the State.

18

That's how the case was brought.

19

was bringing it not on behalf of the corporate entity of

20

the State of California, but was bringing it on behalf of

21

the people of the State of California.

California did not appeal the judgment of the district

therefore, the voter, as well as the State, has a stake?

you had grouped Wisconsin with different States, if you

with a claim that we can do the census better than the

And if I might address the question about

wrong, but not beyond the pale of reason.
QUESTION:

Well, on what basis did the district

3

court go about finding that the Secretary's decision was

wrong, as you put it?

5

MR. RIFKIND:

The basis was, first of all, 13

6

days of trial and the consideration of the evidence

submitted there, but I think very largely on the basis

8

made of concessions made by the Secretary.

9

never found -- never found -- that the adjustment was less

QUESTION:

Perhaps we should refine what you

Secretary's decision was, quote, wrong, close quote.

14

MR. RIFKIND:

What the district court said --

15

and this is in the Wisconsin appendix at page 77 -- the

Secretary has conceded that the objective criteria used to

4

MR. RIFKIND:

I believe, as I believe the Second

Circuit did, that where fundamental constitutional rights

6

are impacted, the court must conduct a more searching

7

inquiry than merely beyond the pale of reason.

8

QUESTION:

How could that be the test?

I mean,

9

if in fact the true cause is that people who live in inner

10

cities and are hard to get to are undercounted, people who

11

live in inner cities and are hard to get to also have more

12

diseases and also eat less well.

13

system that adjusted upwards by 1 percent according to

14

diet would be more accurate.

3

MR. RIFKIND:

Well, the -- I think the key-

4

factors here are that the Census Bureau, the expert

5

agency, to which normally I would suppose considerable

6

deference was due, had spent a great deal of time trying

7

to figure out the solution to the problem, after an

8

enormous amount of effort and a very professional effort

9

had decided that it had figured out the solution, or at

10

least a significant amelioration of the problem, and I

Department of Commerce that there was no other way.

look searchingly at Government action that undermines

10

fundamental constitutional rights, that under those

11

circumstances, when one considers the whole matrix of

12

factors, the fact that an expert agency had made a

overturned it would lead a court to at least inquire did

15

he have very good reasons to overturn it.

here which you say undermines fundamental rights?
MR. RIFKIND:

of counts, in which persons are in very large numbers

Every Director of the Bureau that I have known of -- and

The change in congressional reapportionment?
MR. RIFKIND:

It certainly includes that.

There

3

was -- I should be clear because the Solicitor General

4

questioned this in his brief.

5

There's extensive testimony in the record

uncontested that congressional district by congressional

7

district -- and we used the example of California -- the

8

number of people uncounted varied directly with the number

9

of minority in the congressional district and, to be

10

frank, varied directly with the number of Democrats

11

registered in the district.

12

the regression analyses that were done on it were very

13

meticulous --a very close and overwhelming --

14
15

QUESTION:

So, there is a close -- and

Is there some claim of harm because

of the intrastate districting that results ultimately?

16

MR. RIFKIND:

QUESTION:

MR. RIFKIND:

Absolutely.

You claim that as well.

the point that I made before.

Federal authorities are compelling that.

3

the States, so far as this record shows, have chosen that

that's the way they're going to do their interstate.

That's not because the

There's nothing that shows that the States could

of doing it.

11

They have the numbers.

MR. RIFKIND:
that ought to be right.

They could do it.

I think in my view in principle
I think in practice, with all

respect, I think it's wholly unrealistic.
QUESTION:

But practice -- how does the practice

12

rise to the level of a constitutional decision?

13

saying we know that States could do this, but they won't.

14

Politically they won't.

15

MR. RIFKIND:

We're

So -No, it's not only politically.

16

They're not equipped to do it as a general matter, and

Congress has required --

QUESTION:

Well, I thought you agreed that you

19

got the numbers for them and those numbers,

20

not going to be any less available in the future.

21

MR. RIFKIND:

I take it, are

But they are numbers that until

22

this day had been under the great cloud that the Secretary

23

of Commerce put them under, and that's why I say it would

of Commerce rejected that, but that's what we're going to

use in New York.

I think that takes a temerity --

QUESTION:

3

Because New York would violate one

person/one vote if it used those?

5

anyone could mount such a challenge?
MR. RIFKIND:

Do you think that
