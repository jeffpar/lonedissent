ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARA SUN BEALE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. BEALE:

10

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
This case raises two important questions about

11

the procedural rights afforded to defendants who tender

12

guilty pleas, including criminal forfeiture.

13

The two questions are:

first, whether Rule

14

11(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires

15

the district court to find a factual basis for the

16

defendant's guilty plea to the criminal forfeiture, and

17

second, whether a defendant who waives -- excuse me, a

18

defendant who pleads guilty waives his right to a jury

19

verdict on forfeiture if he was not advised of that right

20

and never expressly waived it.

21

Briefly, the facts are as follows:

in exchange

22

for the prosecutor's agreement to recommend a 20-year

23

sentence on one count, and to drop the remaining counts,

24

petitioner pled guilty to violating 21 U.S.C. section 848,

25

and he signed an agreement containing three paragraphs

regarding criminal forfeiture.
As construed by the court of appeals, paragraph

2

3

10 of that agreement forfeited all of petitioner's

4

property, including legitimately acquired property.

5

The district court accepted petitioner's plea

6

without making a finding that there was a factual basis

7

for this forfeiture.
QUESTION:

said it included legitimately acquired property?
MS. BEALE:

Excuse me, but the court of appeals

The court of appeals said it

12

Right, but it didn't say that it

13

included legitimately acquired property.

14

amounted to, in the court of appeal's view, an

15

acknowledgement that none of his property was legitimately

16

acquired.

MS. BEALE:

Oh, I think that's not correct, Your

Honor.

reason of his agreement, he forfeited properly,

legitimately acquired property, is what you said.

3

MS. BEALE:

That's correct.

4

QUESTION:

Where does it say that?

QUESTION:

Wouldn't it be more accurate to say

6

that they said he forfeited everything he owned on the

7

assumption some of it might have been legitimately

acquired?

their reading he would have forfeited it.
MS. BEALE:

11

Even if some was legitimately acquired, under

That's correct, and -- I mean, that

would be another proper reading.
QUESTION:

12

I think --

Does their reading -- is there an

13

indication that their reading was that the legitimately

14

acquired property was also nonforfeitable?

MS. BEALE:

Perhaps it would be helpful --

QUESTION:

4

I don't think you'll find that

Okay, and the district court was in

5

fact holding hearings that would have been relevant to

6

that determination, but they were the hearings without

7

jurisdiction, so we can't depend on that.

8

MS. BEALE:

That is correct.

9

I believe the court of appeals' opinion is quite

10

clear that their point is that petitioner entered into an

11

agreement that would forfeit all property without any

12

determination whether it was or was not, for example,

QUESTION:

20

MS. BEALE:

Mm-hmm.
Right, so there was no finding, for

21

example, that that property in the district court level or

22

at the court of appeals level, that it was forfeitable

23

because it was proc -- because it was not legitimately

24

acquired, and so the point merely is that it would take

25

some factual -- set of factual assumptions to show that

1

legitimately acquired property is, in fact, subject to

2

forfeiture.

3

depending upon the facts that were shown, and the district

4

court never made those factual findings in the first

5

instance, so if I can clarify that.

It could become subject to forfeiture,

The district court also accepted petitioner's

6

7

plea without advising him that he had a right to a special

8

jury verdict on the question of what property, if any, was

9

subject to forfeiture, although he had a right, and it

10

would have been possible for him to plead guilty, and

11

nonetheless contest on the section 848 charge, and

12

nonetheless contest forfeiture before the jury.

13

not advised of that right, and he never expressly waived

14

it.

15

QUESTION:

He was

Suppose the district judge had told

16

Libretti how it would play out if he stood trial, exactly

17

what would have to be proved, so he knew all that when he

18

entered his plea.

19

the legal requirements, if the judge had told him, just as

20

he tells him with respect to his substantive offense, now,

21

if you stand trial, there will be a jury trial on these

22

assets, and there will be this special verdict, told him

23

exactly what would happen if he stood trial, and he says,

24

Your Honor, I want this plea, and then at the end he says

25

what he did here, I want proof made with respect to these

Would that have been enough to satisfy

assets -MS. BEALE:

Well, there are really two

3

requirements that we're talking about, and it's important

4

for me to distinguish those.

5

One of the issues before the Court is the

6

question of the waiver standard that's applicable to the

7

jury trial right, and on that point, for example, if the

8

judge had clearly indicated to Mr. Libretti not simply

9

that the jury won't find you guilty or innocent, which is

10

what he told Mr. Libretti, but had said, the jury won't

11

find you guilty or innocent, and you have a right to have

12

that determination, and the jury won't make any

13

determination of what assets are forfeitable, and you have

14

a right to that determination as well, now, do you want to

15

plead guilty, that would have taken care of the waiver of

16

the jury trial right.

17

There's an independent requirement, however,

18

under Rule 11(f) for a factual basis, and I think that's

19

clear if you imagine a case -- laying forfeiture to one

20

side, if you imagine a case as a bank robbery case.

21

QUESTION:

22

MS. BEALE:

So -In that instance there would be both

23

a requirement that the defendant waive his right to a jury

24

trial, and also a requirement that a factual basis be

25

shown for his plea to the bank robbery offense.

So it's

true
QUESTION:

2

Your answer to my question is -- your

3

answer is no, it would not have been enough to tell him

4

exactly how this would play out if he stood trial.

5

would still have a right to insist on some kind of a

6

showing with respect to each piece of property.
MS. BEALE:

7

He

That's correct, and the reason for

8

that is that it's exactly parallel to the requirements for

9

a plea of guilty on the offenses that are charged.
The purpose of the factual basis requirement

10
11

really is to ensure that there's a match between the

12

evidence in the case on the one hand and the legal

13

requirements of the charge on the other hand, and if there

14

are five or six counts in the indictment, there's got to

QUESTION:

Well, suppose that not all of the

17

property had yet been identified.

18

substantial forfeiture is going to occur, but we don't

know quite where the bank accounts are, what the amount

20

is, where the location of the real property is, then how

21

would you proceed?

We know that a

Could you not take the plea agreement?

Now, the standard is not --

QUESTION:

9
10

Well, under your view the court

couldn't even take the plea.
MS. BEALE:

That's correct to the extent that

11

it's a dependent part of that plea.

12

other charges that could be entirely resolved.

13

Now, there might be

In our view, the requirements of Federal law do

14

make the forfeiture charge a substantive charge.

15

Court is aware, Federal rules require it to be charged in

16

the indictment, proved to the jury with a special jury

verdict, and embodied in the judgment.

As the

Those are very substantial requirements that

effectively make forfeiture a unique hybrid.

law, have this unique character of a substantive charge in

two ways to resolve the charge.

QUESTION:

There are only-

Ms. Beale, can I ask you a question

6

about the relief that's prompted by Justice Kennedy's

7

question and your answer that if there are two counts,

8

there was no factual basis for one, a guilty plea might

9

stand as to one count, I guess?
Is it your view that if there's no factual basis

10
11

for the forfeiture but there is an adequate factual basis

12

for the guilt of the offense charge, that the guilty plea

13

would remain in effect and the judgment of guilt could

14

stand even though the forfeiture is improper?

Well, in this case, Your Honor, as

QUESTION:

Well, first in general, and then in

this case.
MS. BEALE:

All right.

In general, I believe

20

that it might be possible to resolve the underlying -- the

21

question of the underlying guilt and take the plea to

22

that, and leave unresolved for the moment the forfeiture

23

charge and the -- whether that would be ultimately

24

resolved by a jury determination of that, or whether that

25

might also be resolved by a plea on the forfeiture with a

2

QUESTION:

Could the court then enter a judgment

3

of conviction on the guilty plea of the charge and reserve

4

for further hearings what to do --

5

MS. BEALE:

That's correct, in the same way.

6

Typically -- now, that was not done in this case, but

7

typically the way these indictments are drawn up is to

8

include the forfeiture charge in a separate count.

sv

factual basis and with the necessary waiver.

QUESTION:
MS. BEALE:

I see.
And you would literally plead to

11

count 2 and not 3, 4, 5, and so forth, and I think that

12

would be certainly possible that the parties would agree

13

to resolve it that way and the court would be willing to

14

accept the guilty plea under those circumstances.

15
16

QUESTION:

All right.

Now --

Then, going to this case,

what could be done in this case --

17

MS. BEALE:

Exactly.

18

QUESTION:

19

MS. BEALE:

20

Now, in this case, it appears that the parties

-- if we should agree with you?
Well, exactly.

21

had a kind of interwoven or interrelated agreement.

As I

22

said, in return for the prosecutor's agreement to

23

recommend a 20-year sentence and not to proceed with the

24

other counts, then petitioner agreed to plead guilty, and

25

I think that where the resolution of the counts is

1

interrelated as a matter of plea-bargain and the parties'

2

understanding, then the court may indeed need to accept or

3

reject, resolve all at one time, otherwise the parties may

4

not in fact be tendering that agreement to the court.

5

Now -- well --

6

QUESTION:

7

Can I have one other question, then

I'll be covered everything I had at the back of my mind.

8

What if the agreement were totally ambiguous,

9

and I think I read the court of appeals opinion the way

10

you do, too, saying that even if some of the property

11

might not be forfeitable, nevertheless we construe the

12

agreement as an undertaking to forfeit everything.

13

Assume it's clear that that's what the agreement

14

was in exchange for a somewhat lesser sentence, would that

15

agreement be enforceable, in your view?

16

MS. BEALE:

It depends, so that if the factual

17

basis showing was that in fact, let's say, substitute

18

assets would reach even with legitimately acquired

19

property -QUESTION:

20

No, some of the property that he

21

agreed to forfeit, the Government would have no valid

22

claim to.

23

MS. BEALE:

We think it's clear that the court

24

cannot accept a plea on that basis and enter a sentence

25

any more than it could accept petitioner's agreement to

1

serve a 30-year sentence if the statutory maximum were 20

2

years, even if he was willing to agree to that, even if he

3

might, for example, be willing to agree to that to avoid

4

the prosecution of his wife, or his child, or to preserve

5

a uniquely valuable asset.
There are policy-based outer limitations on the

6

7

court's sentencing authority, and those clearly have to be

8

observed or the sentence itself is illegal, and we

9

think -QUESTION:

10

Does the case depend -- does your

11

argument depend on whether we characterize this as

12

sentencing enhancement or an element of the offense?

13

MS. BEALE:

14

QUESTION:

15

Well -Is that a pivotal point in the

analysis?

16

MS. BEALE:

I think that the characterization of

17

the criminal forfeiture itself is exactly the pivotal

18

point.

19

What I would not -QUESTION:

If it's enhancement of the offense,

20

then what happens to your case, if it's an enhancement of

21

punishment?

22

MS. BEALE:

We concede that forfeiture operates

23

as a penalty, so in that sense, sentencing enhancement

24

would be one way of describing that penalty, that there's

25

a period of imprisonment plus this enhanced penalty of

What we don't accept is the notion that there

3

are only two possibilities.

4

offense on the one hand, and mere matters of sentencing on

5

the other hand.

6

There are the elements of the

We think what Congress did was, in reviving

7

criminal forfeiture and then the rules promulgated first

8

by the advisory committee, then adopted by this Court and

9

Congress, what they did was create something, quite

10

properly, that is a unique hybrid, that is not, strictly

11

speaking, an element of any particular offense but is

12

plainly not treated like any other matter of sentencing,

13

so it operates as a penalty, but it has far different

14

procedural characteristics associated with it that reflect

15

a different -- a quite different weighting of the

16

interests that are involved there.

If

characterization is just a shorthand way of summing up

those attributes, so I'm not so sure that it matters what

QUESTION:

Well, but it's a shorthand way, in

effect, of obfuscating this hybrid character.

6

MS. BEALE:

7

QUESTION:

Well -Let me make this suggestion to you.

8

Let's assume for the sake of argument there is in fact a

9

Sixth Amendment right to the determination with respect to

10

the forfeiture.

I don't know whether there is or not, but

11

1

Well, he would have to satisfy

himself that there were facts supporting it, but one of

3

the bits of evidence he could look to, and I think one of

4

the primary pieces of evidence, would be the parties'

Sure.

MR. STEWART:

-- that it was so, and I think one

8

highly relevant portion of the colloquy at the sentencing

hearing --

10

QUESTION:

In other words, he has to find in the

11

agreement a factual basis for concluding the assets are

12

forfeitable.

13

MR. STEWART:

He has to find -- he has to be

14

satisfied that the property is forfeitable under the

15

statute, and typically one of the ways that judges resolve

16

potential factual disputes is by agreement or stipulation

17

of the parties.

18

QUESTION:

Right, so you're saying he does not

19

have to satisfy himself personally of the factual basis.

20

It is enough if he receives from the defendant a

21

concession that a factual basis exists.

22

But if no concession that a factual

24

MR. STEWART:

I'm suggesting in the context of

I'll let you run as long as you want in a second, but I

What's the source of that obligation?
The courts have recognized through

Does that get you to the equivalent

of Rule 11, then?
MR. STEWART:

I don't believe so, and let me

explain by reference to McCarthy v. United States.
In McCarthy v. United States, the Government

7

made, with respect to guilty pleas, something very similar

8

to the argument that I'm making with regard to sentencing

9

stipulations.

That is, the Government argued the mere

10

fact that McCarthy entered a plea of guilty is a

11

sufficient reason for us to conclude that he must have

12

committed the crime, and the Court said, that's not good

13

enough, and it pointed to rule -- what at that time was

14

Rule 11, it hadn't been recodified as Rule 11(f), and said

15

the rule specifically requires in the context of guilty

16

pleas that the judge look beyond the party's plea, and the

17

Court stated that the reasons for this requirement are

18

specific to the context of guilty pleas.

19

precisely because a plea of guilty to a criminal offense

20

has such severe consequences, because a criminal

21

conviction is thought to be such a significant step, the

22

court has an obligation with respect to pleas of guilty

23

that is not imposed with respect to concessions or

24

stipulations generally.

And I think implicit in this discussion is,

But it's still not the same as saying

12

It doesn't say that.

the assets that were subsequently encompassed in the

He made his deal.

If you look at page 324 of the

6

fifth line from the bottom, the court of appeals states,

he intended to forfeit all of his property without

requiring the Government to prove the assets were

The plea agreement requires forfeiture

pursuant to section 853, which includes forfeitable assets

under 853(a) and substitute assets under section 853(p).

on its face that the other half of the assets were not

try the case despite the entry of the plea agreement.
Now, it's very clear that the defendant could

3

simply plead guilty without an agreement and preserve his

4

right to contest the forfeitability of assets.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Stewart, let me go back to the

6

question I asked Ms. Beale, that this defendant was not

7

told by the district judge going in about this most

8

unusual kind of a jury determination that he would be

9

entitled to if he didn't plead guilty.

10
11

That is, the

special verdict and all of that.
Doesn't he, to waive that right to the jury

12

determination on the forfeiture, at least have to know

13

about this extraordinary -- a special verdict in a

14

criminal case is really extraordinary procedure, isn't it,

15

and not one word was said about that.

16

MR. STEWART:

We agree, but we don't believe

17

that the knowing relinquishment standard of Johnson v.

18

Zerbst would apply.

19

defendant obviously gave up a host of rights that he could

20

have asserted at a trial had he insisted --

That is, by pleading guilty, the

21

QUESTION:

22

those rights, or many of them.

23

about this unusual right.

24
25

But under Rule 11 he's told about

MR. STEWART:

He's certainly not told

He's told about a small set of

fundamental constitutional rights.

He's not required

1

under Rule 11 to be told about any statutory rights, and

2

we believe that Rule 31(e) is not a constitutional

3

dimension.

4

Moreover, he was told at the plea colloquy that

5

he had the right to be tried by a jury.

I think part --

6

in a sense, petitioner's argument presumes that on the one

7

hand the right to a jury determination on forfeiture is

8

part and parcel of the Sixth Amendment right to jury

9

trial, but that on the other hand for purposes of the

10

Rule 11 colloquy they are two different things, so the

11

advice that you have the right to be tried by a jury

12

doesn't encompass the right -- the advice that you have

13

the right to be tried to a jury on forfeiture.

14

In general, the Rule 11 colloquy would not

15

involve an elaborate parsing out of the functions that

16

judge and jury would play at trial, so even if a defendant

17

received a perfectly adequate Rule 11 colloquy, he might

18

still be uncertain as to whether particular issues would

19

have been resolved by the judge or by the jury.

20

QUESTION:

I'm not asking you anything abstract.

21

I'm asking you about, this is a peculiar kind of a jury

22

trial right.

23

no notion that it exists because nobody told him about it?

24
25

Does defendant waive that even though he has

MR. STEWART:
by the court.

Yes.

We know that he was not told

We don't know whether he was told by his

counsel, but he could waive it regardless of whether he

2

had actual knowledge, and the court has --

3

I -- the notion of an unknowing,

4

unconscious waiver is disturbing.

5

well, he doesn't -- he's really not entitled to know about

6

it, so it doesn't matter that he wasn't told.

7

MR. STEWART:

QUESTION:

9
10

*\

QUESTION:

I can see you say,

Well, in --

How can you waive something that you

don't know you have a right to?
MR. STEWART:

Well, the Court has recognized in

11

a variety of circumstances that as a general matter a

12

defendant's rights, even constitutional rights, can be

13

waived simply by the failure to assert them at the proper

14

time, so it can often happen during the course of a

15

criminal trial --

16

QUESTION:

Well, yes, but here, if we make the

17

assumption for the sake of argument that this particular

18

right, the jury determination with respect to forfeiture,

19

is of constitutional dimension, then it would be very odd

20

to say that the same guilty plea which waives the right to

21

a trial on guilt and innocence should be treated

22

differently from the guilty plea insofar as it waives the

23

jury determination with respect to the forfeiture.

24
25

I mean, why would you draw that distinction?
There's no pragmatic reason to do so.

It's not that you

and client, or what-not.

constitutional -- that the determination on forfeiture is

of constitutional significance?

MR. STEWART:

Why would you ever draw that

7

Rule 11 the drafters didn't state that the defendant had

9

No, but just why -- just -- my

10

question is, why would you want to draw that distinction?

11

What would make that a rational and sensible distinction

12

to draw?

13

MR. STEWART:

Well, my answer may sound as

14

though it's questioning your premise that this falls

15

within the Sixth Amendment, but the fact is that the

16

procedural protections available at a criminal trial as a

17

prerequisite to a determination of guilt or innocence have

18

always been given a higher status than procedural

19

protections available at sentencing.

That does sound as though you're

And if you don't reject my premise,
Why would you draw that distinction?

would draw that distinction because we think that the

2

drafters of Rule 11 drew that distinction.

3

to the right to be tried by a jury, they placed it in the

4

context of other rights that were clearly going to be

5

asserted at a trial rather than at a sentencing

6

proceeding.

They referred

And the second point we would make is, again, if

8

this is part and parcel of the Sixth Amendment right to be

9

tried by a jury he was told, you have the right to be

10
11

tried by a jury, and he waived it.
QUESTION:

Well, he was told that, and yet in

12

the colloquy which is in -- which has been already

13

adverted to, the judge as part of that colloquy then went

14

on to say, now, if you plead guilty, that's going to be

15

the end of it and so on, and he says, the jury is not

16

going to decide whether you're guilty or not.

17

suggests to me, would suggest to me if I were the

18

defendant standing there, that my jury trial right goes to

19

guilt or innocence.

20

That

It would not suggest to me that I had a jury

21

trial right with respect to the forfeiture, and even if I

22

assume for the sake of argument that the -- that a mere

23

statement or an unqualified statement saying you waive

24

your right to jury trial, of all matters charged against

25

you, or what-not, would be sufficient, it seems to me,

going back to Justice Ginsburg's question, what happened

2

here is the judge seems to have modified that later in the

3

colloquy to indicate that the jury trial right just goes

4

to guilt or innocence.

5

MR. STEWART:

Well, certainly that statement --

6

I think the judge was primarily focusing on the right to

7

jury trial on guilt or innocence, because that's the thing

8

that's generally at issue.

9

QUESTION:

So if you were standing there

10

listening, wouldn't you draw the conclusion that you had a

11

jury trial right on guilt and innocence, and likewise

12

conclude that you didn't have a jury trial right on

13

anything else?

14
15

MR. STEWART:

I think that's probably the most

likely inference, and our position has never been --

But normally you don't have a jury

17

trial on the sentence, so what I don't understand is that

verdict, and to say that a defendant -- a judge doesn't

21

even have the obligation to tell the judge -- the

22

defendant with respect to this forfeiture in the absence

23

of a plea agreement there would be a jury trial right, and

the jury would have to make special findings on each item

MR. STEWART:

1

I mean, in -- the Rule 11 really

2

encompasses two categories of information that have to be

3

conveyed to the defendant.

4

will happen to you if you plead guilty, what's the minimum

5

and maximum sentence, and so forth, and the other category

6

of information is, what rights would you be able to insist

7

on if you didn't plead guilty and insisted upon a trial,

8

and the idea is to allow the defendant in some rough sense

9

to compare the options available to him.

One is information about what

I think one thing that's noteworthy about the

10
11

second category of information -- what would happen to you

12

if you insisted upon a right to trial -- is that it

13

doesn't include any information about sentencing.

14

is, the defendant is not required to be told, this would

15

be your minimum and maximum sentence if you insisted upon

16

a right to trial.

That

17

Indeed, in Brady v. United States, the Court

18

held that a defendant's guilty plea was voluntary even

19

though he reasonably believed that he would be subject to

20

a sentence of death if he insisted upon trial and was

21

convicted.

22

It turned out that that was not the case, that

23

that statutory capital provision was invalid, and

24

therefore the defendant pleaded guilty under the

25

misapprehension that he would be subject to a capital

7

Am I correct that the only issue before the

8

court of appeals was the order of forfeiture, not the plea

9

of guilt or innocence?

10

MR. STEWART:

11

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And secondly, is it your reading of

12

the court of appeals opinion that the post plea

13

proceedings on forfeiture that the district judge was

14

conducting cannot be conducted under the holding of the

15

court of appeals?

16

MR. STEWART:

The court of appeals said that the

district court retained jurisdiction to adjudicate third

party claims to the property, but that the district court

19

did not retain jurisdiction to entertain the petition.

QUESTION:
