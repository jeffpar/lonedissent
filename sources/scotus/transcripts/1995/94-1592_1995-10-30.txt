ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE H. MANN

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MANN:

13
14

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

15

The obvious question for you to ask me this

16

morning is, if Congress intended for waiting time for

17

deadhead transportation to be time on duty, why didn't it

18

say so specifically?

19

Well, the answer to that, at least in my mind,

20

is very simple.

21

of all encompasses many train operations.

22

petitioners acknowledge that there are thousands of train

23

operations daily.

24

were 36,000 train operations each day, so --

25

We're dealing with a statute that first

QUESTION:

Even the

At the time of the '69 statute, there

What do you mean when you say train

operations?
MR. MANN:

Meaning, a crew goes on duty and

3

performs service for the railroad.

4

train operation, Your Honor.

5

That would be one

And the other answer to that is, and I think

6

it's the real guts of the case is, there was no need to

7

specifically state that waiting time was time on duty

8

because Congress treated that issue in several sections of
the statute, and I refer the Court to section 21103(b),

10

and I will talk about (1),

11

subsections.

12

(2),

(3),

(4),

(5), and (6)

And in each one of those subsections it's very

13

clear that Congress was attempting -- and I submit to you

14

they did close the loopholes, and one basic problem is

15

that railroad workers at that period of time were sitting

16

on trains for hours on end waiting for a pickup crew or

17

another train to come along and take them to their final

18

release period, and it's -- throughout the entire

1

amendments the sole purpose was to close those loopholes,

20

and they did it in several ways.

21

First of all, you don't have to be working at

22

all to be covered as time on duty under the act, because

23

it's very clear -- you know, I'm just a country boy, Your

24

Honors, but English is English.

QUESTION:

Where are you reading from, Mr. Mann?

2

MR. MANN:

Excuse me, Your Honor.

3

QUESTION:

And where will we find it?

4

MR. MANN:

This is section 21103 --

5

QUESTION:

Page 2 of the petition?

6

MR. MANN:

In my brief, Your Honor, it is --

7

yes, page 2 of the petition.

8

subsection (5), Your Honor, an interim period available

9

for rest.

Page 3, number (5),

Now, what the carriers and the Government is

11

telling you is that this period of time should not be

considered here.

conditions on each section, not giving it its broad and

14

plain meaning.

15
16

They want to write out and put

They --

QUESTION:

Well, are you reading out the word,

MR. MANN:

The interim, Justice Souter, means

interim?

17
18

interim between the time you go on duty and the time that

19

you're finally released from duty.
QUESTION:

20
21

It doesn't mean interim as between

two periods of active duty?

22

MR. MANN:

It does not, Your Honor.

23

QUESTION:

Do we have a definition in the

MR. MANN:

Well, we have some legislative

24
25

statute?

history.
In the hearings, as well as in the Senate

report, it talks about final release of all -- finally

released from all responsibilities.

pudding there is --

QUESTION:

The proof of the

I'm sorry, I'm just not getting it.

7

I'm sure somewhere they use that phrase, but how are you

8

connecting that with the meaning of the word?

9

MR. MANN:

Well, interim --

10

QUESTION:

Interim.

11

MR. MANN:

Interim means, as discussed in the

12

House hearings and the industry spokesman, the Association

13

of American Railroads, made that point clear, Your Honor,

14

if I -QUESTION:

15

Well, he may have done it, but is

16

there a House or a Senate report that defines the term, or

17

indicates -MR. MANN:

18
19

It does not define the term.

Congress -QUESTION:

20

If I understand your argument

21

correctly, your meaning would have been conveyed better if

22

the word interim were left out, just a period available

23

for rest.

24

MR. MANN:

Well --

QUESTION:

What does interim add that helps

rather than hurts your position?
MR. MANN:

position.

It -- I submit it doesn't hurt my

It includes periods for operations.
QUESTION:

But you would be stronger, your

5

argument would be stronger, would it not, if the statute

6

didn't say, interim?

7

MR. MANN:

Somewhat, but I don't think it's

8

definitive, because as the railroad -- the chief railroad

9

witness, and I think it's very critical, testified, and I

10

refer to the House hearings at page 135, where Mr.

11

Manion -- Mr. Manion was the vice president of the

12

Association of American Railroads, and he v/as talking

13

about the problems of deadheading transportation and what

14

would happen if the bill as was introduced were adopted,

15

and after he discussed that part, he said, however, under

16

another provision of H.R. 8449, which is the section

17

dealing with interim periods for rest, section 1(b)(3) --

18

now, that is exactly the same as what was passed,

19

subsection (5), and I quote:

20

Periods available for rest at other than a

21

designated terminal will be included as time on duty.

22

Consequently, if a crew reaches the hours-of-service limit

23

in the country and is relieved there, it will still be on

24

duty for purposes of hours-of-service purposes because it

25

is not relieved at a designated terminal.

QUESTION:

Who says this?

2

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Mann, even for people

3

devoted to legislative history, that's a fairly low level,

4

isn't it, what a witness testified?

5

MR. MANN:

Except, Your Honors, this was an

6

industry spokesman, the Association of American Railroads,

7

on a bill that only affected them, and what Congress was

8

attempting to do is to close all these loopholes, and I

9

submit to you, this statement as far as I am concerned -QUESTION:

10

11

Well, how do we know that Congress

intended to "close all these loopholes"?

12

MR. MANN:

Well, the act solely --

13

QUESTION:

It's not called the loophole-closing

14

act.

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. MANN:

No, Your Honor.

The act solely deals

17

with placing in the act periods of time that not -- that

18

previously were not time on duty as being time on duty,

19

with one exception, deadhead transportation to the final

20

release point.
Everything else that they did, the Congress made

21

22

it time on duty to eliminate every abuse that was

23

testified to in these hearings, and this is the industry

24

spokesman.

25

Now, you can look at the hearings, and I spent

1

some time doing that, to see what all the rest of the

2

witnesses stated from the industry.
QUESTION:

3
4

But is there something in there that

talks about the definition of deadhead transportation?

5

MR. MANN:

Yes, there is.

6

QUESTION:

Deadhead transportation, I would

7

think sometimes when people are transported they include

8

the time that they're sitting around in the station

9

waiting room --

10

MR. MANN:

Well, that's --

11

QUESTION:

-- or the airport --

12

MR. MANN:

That's one of the issues.

13

QUESTION:

-- and sometimes they don't, so it

14

all seems quite ambiguous to me, anyway, and if it's

15

ambiguous, shouldn't you leave this kind of interpretation

16

to the agency?

17

MR. MANN:

Well, two things, Justice Breyer.

18

One is, of course, the industry, how they dealt with

19

deadhead transportation, and here's how they define it --

20

Mr. Manion again.

21

performed by railroad employees at the direction of a

22

railroad.

Deadheading may be defined as travel

23

Now, he was not the only railroad witness.

24

QUESTION:

But that doesn't do it, does it?

25

MR. MANN:

Well -9

QUESTION:

1

I say I'm traveling to Boston.

2

might or might not include in my travel time the time

3

spent at the airport.

4

MR. MANN:

That's correct.

5

QUESTION:

All right.

I

So is there something

6

there that says, by the way, we don't mean time spent at

7

the station, or spent at the airport, or sitting around

8

waiting for the train to show up?

9

that?

10

Is there anything like

I -MR. MANN:

There are three things.

One is

11

commingled service, which is defined in the statute as any

12

other service for the carrier.

13

You're not free to leave the premises except being under

14

the control and subject to being called, and you're not

15

finally released from duty until you get back at the

16

terminal and do other ministerial duties.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Mann,

You are part of the crew.

is it your position that if

18

you are deadheaded back to your final point of release,

19

while you're waiting to get the first train, let's say to

20

Omaha, that is on-duty time?

21

What about -- suppose you have to wait again in

22

Omaha to get another train to New York City, where you're

23

going to be released?

24

of deadhead --

25

MR. MANN:

What about that wait?

All time -- all time -10

Is that part

1

QUESTION:

So you're not on duty while you go

2

from Omaha to -- where did -- from wherever you're --

3

wherever you end your work to Omaha, you're not on duty --

4

MR. MANN:

You are on duty.

5

QUESTION:

While you're being transported?

6

MR. MANN:

You're on duty.

V

in the statute.

8

that's subsection (4) of the --

9
10
11
12

That's specifically

From the time you mark on duty, and

QUESTION:

I thought deadheaded transportation

back is not counted.
MR. MANN:

Deadheaded transportation back, at

the end of your tour of duty, at the end of your tour --

13

QUESTION:

Okay --

14

MR. MANN:

-- of operations --

15

QUESTION:

My tour has ended in San Francisco.

16

MR. MANN:

Okay.

17

QUESTION:

And I -- they've arranged to get me

18

back by putting me on a train to Omaha, all right.

19

you say while I'm waiting in San Francisco, I'm still on

20

duty, all right.

21

Now,

What about while I'm waiting in Omaha?

MR. MANN:

It's all commingled service, and it's

22

also time that is free for rest, and under the statute,

23

that's on-duty time.

24
25

QUESTION:

And what about the transportation

while I'm on the train between San Francisco and Omaha?

(800) FOR DEPO

MR. MANN:

1

That is not, because of the statutory-

2

provision.

That's why Congress carved out this one

3

exception.

The only exception is that it will not be

4

counted as time on duty, nor time off duty.

5

period of actual movement, traveling in -- traveling in is

6

the key.

7
8

QUESTION:

Why is that magic?

That one

I don't

understand that.

9

MR. MANN:

Well, because --

10

QUESTION:

I mean, if -- it makes no sense at

MR. MANN:

Well, maybe -- maybe free at rest

11

all.

12

13

makes no sense at all, either, but it would create an

14

anomaly.

15

The anomaly would be this -QUESTION:

You don't think it's an anomaly that

16

I'm on duty while I'm at rest and back on duty whenever I

17

start moving again?

18

MR. MANN:

Congress said so.

19

QUESTION:

And if I have eight stops along the

20
21

way, I'm on-off, on-off.
MR. MANN:

If Congress had not said that rest

22

time was time on duty, I would agree with you, but

23

Congress didn't say that.

24
25

QUESTION:

Mr. Mann, what happens if I'm being

transported back in a van and there's a breakdown, and it
12

1

takes 3 hours to get that van fixed so it can move again

2

to the place where I'll be released?

3

We know that the time that you're in the van is

4

deadhead time, and it's not on-duty time.

5

the car breaks down and I'm waiting to have it fixed?

6

MR. MANN:

What about when

It's a good question, but I would

7

submit to you that the way Congress envisioned this, I

8

would argue to you that any time that you're not

9

traveling, and it's very clear if you look at the statute

10

and the meaning of the terms, if you're not traveling in

11

the deadhead transportation, then it's either commingled

12

service, you're performing other service --

13

QUESTION:

No service.

I'm waiting --

14

MR. MANN:

When you're waiting --

15

QUESTION:

-- for the van to be fixed.

16

MR. MANN:

-- that's rest time.

17

QUESTION:

Well, why isn't it on duty time, as

18

it is in Justice Scalia's Omaha wait.

19

in Omaha but not on duty sitting on the side of the road?

20

MR. MANN:

Why is he on duty

Congress said that an interim period

21

available for rest is time on duty.

22

completely --

You can be at rest

23

QUESTION:

He's at rest on the side of the road.

24

MR. MANN:

Mm-hmm.

25

QUESTION:

So he's on duty, so the answer to

1

Justice Ginsburg's question is, he's on duty.
MR. MANN:

2

He doesn't have to be performing any

3

duty.

He can simply be doing nothing, just sitting there

4

waiting, doing absolutely nothing --

5

QUESTION:

But it's treated as on-duty time.

6

MR. MANN:

Specifically.

7

QUESTION:

Yes.

8

QUESTION:

Yes.

9

QUESTION:

I assume you don't take the position

10

that when the van stops for a red light he's back on duty,

11

do you?

12

(Laughter.)

13

QUESTION:

14
15

Is it a -- it's not an in-motion

theory, not completely that, huh?
MR. MANN:

Typically, the problem --we wouldn't

16

be here if there hasn't been tremendous abuses.

What we

17

have as a typical situation, at the end of the 12 hours a

18

crew is waiting and waiting and waiting.

19

in the record that up to 10 hours, sometimes, they have to

20

wait for someone to come and get them --

We have evidence

QUESTION:

Can I go back -- I'm -- I --

22

MR. MANN:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

My question -- and you just didn't

24
25

have a chance to get out the other two things -MR. MANN:

QUESTION:

1

-- and what I was curious, remember,

2

that this word deadhead transportation struck me, at least

3

in the statute, as ambiguous, that of course deadhead

4

transportation is limbo time, yes --

5

MR. MANN:

Yes .

6

QUESTION:

-- but what is deadhead

7

transportation, and my question was, what evidence is

8

there that you could not -- not that you -- but you could

9

not read those words, deadhead transportation, to include

10

time in the station, time waiting to go on the train

11

itself, as we do with airplanes and trains normally.

12

MR. MANN:

If you're --

13

QUESTION:

And what is it in -- and you listed

14

three things.

The first thing was, you said I should look

15

at the commingled, the definition of commingled --

16

MR. MANN:

Commingling --

17

QUESTION:

-- and you were going to mention two

MR. MANN:

That's correct.

18

others

19
20

One is the rest

period, interim period for rest --

QUESTION:

Where would I -- where do I find --

You mean just in the statute here, or

2

QUESTION:

All right.

I've looked at that.

It

didn't seem --

3

MR. MANN:

Oh -- oh, I --

4

QUESTION:

-- to me that it was clear.

5

MR. MANN:

Well, let me --

6

QUESTION:

One is the definition of commingled

7

in the statute, the other is the definition of rest

8

period, and what was the third?

9
10

MR. MANN:

The third is, what was Congress

trying to do here?

11

QUESTION:

Okay, what?

12

MR. MANN:

Congress was trying to eliminate the

13

abuses, and this was one of the greatest abuses that the

14

industry was accomplishing.

15

out there an inordinate amount of time, and they're still

16

doing it today.

17

QUESTION:

They were leaving these crews

Well, if, in fact, it is an abuse,

18

and if, in fact, the agency has significant delegated

19

power to define deadhead transportation either way or

20

partial ways, then couldn't you deal with that problem

21

through the agency dealing with it?

22

MR. MANN:

I don't think the agency, Justice

23

Breyer, has the authority here.

This is the one statute,

24

the only safety statute on the books, in which the Federal

25

Railroad Administration does not have regulatory

They enforce, but they have no regulatory

In fact, Congress took away the authority.

In the old statute in 1908, the old statute, the

Interstate Commerce Commission did have that jurisdiction.

QUESTION:

But they can interpret.

MR. MANN:

They can interpret, yes.

7

QUESTION:

They can interpret, and they did.

8

MR. MANN:

They did.

9

QUESTION:

And they said, we think that two

10

things go together.

11

the waiting time, everything, is on-duty time.

When you're going to the job, then

MR. MANN:

Yes .

13

QUESTION:

And when you're going from the job,

14

then everything is this limbo thing.

15

just make entire sense as an interpretation?

16

MR. MANN:

Why doesn't that

It does in one respect, but the other

17

respect I can just say, the very opposite is true.

18

to deadhead trans -- deadhead to-duty assignment obviously

19

includes the time you report to duty, and the time you are

20

actually traveling, because the first subsection states

21

very clearly that time on duty begins when you report for

22

duty, so obviously, and I could argue that if that is time

23

on duty from the point of reporting to duty and actually

24

moving in transit, then the opposite situation coming back

25

is the same.

QUESTION:

1

But one thing is not the same.

You

2

can't get very far with your release point, because the

3

statute tells us that the deadhead transportation time

4

back, before the point at which you're released, that that

5

time is limbo time.

6

MR. MANN:

That's correct, but the statute also

7

tells you that, unlike what the respondents are saying, it

8

tells you that you are not -- there's -- the position of

9

the respondents, simply put, is that the employee is off-

10

duty, no further obligations, after the 12 hours is

11

reached.

12

That's just not the fact.
QUESTION:

Well, that's a factual question.

We

13

didn't take this case to figure out the fact of whether

14

there are duties, and I at least am going to decide it on

15

the assumption that there aren't.

16

that there are duties in a particular case, it's a

17

different case.

18

Now, if you can prove

But let's assume there are no duties, that the

19

railroad worker is simply waiting to go back to where his

20

rest time begins.

21

Now, I can see why Congress would want deadhead

22

time, including the time waiting for the deadhead

23

transportation to arrive, I can understand why they would

24

want that to count at the beginning of the work period,

25

because by the end of the work period, the worker's going

But at the end of the work period, what

You should count that time against

difference does it make?

5

MR. MANN:

Well --

6

QUESTION:

He's not doing any more work for the

7

railroad, his rest time for the mandatory period of rest

8

he has to take doesn't begin -- this is limbo time, right,

9

it's not rest time.

10

MR. MANN:

Correct.

11

QUESTION:

So what -- why would Congress want it

12

to count towards work time?

13

MR. MANN:

There are several --

14

QUESTION:

I can't understand it.

15

MR. MANN:

-- answers to that.

Number 1, why

16

would they want just rest time to be time on duty?

17

Because there were abuses at that time, and there are

18

still abuses.

19

That's one reason.

QUESTION:

Yes, but that's going back to your

20

claim that in fact they're really being required to do

21

something.

22

inconsistent with the --

23

It seems to me that that answer is

time on the job will be stretched, and by the end of the

MR. MANN:

Justice Scalia --

QUESTION:

Here we're talking, by definition,

14

about a situation where their job is done, and it's not

going to be counted toward their rest time, and it's not

going to make them more tired for any duties that they

perform.

MR. MANN:

I respectfully differ with you

20

don't end.

MR. MANN:

it doesn't.

Yes.

MR. MANN:

referring to both provisions, except when I read to you on

MR. MANN:

It's what Congress --

As Justice Breyer was saying in one of his

If the import of the question is, how big a

person would normally answer it in a way that included

associated waiting time.

12

If the person were known to find air travel

naturally infer that the point of the question was, how

much time were you placed in this uncomfortable position,

as part of time spent in deadhead transportation, I think

20

the inquiry should focus on, why did Congress define this

21

as limbo time in the first place, and do the same concerns

22

that caused Congress to define a category of limbo time

23

apply with equal force to the waiting time at issue here,

24

and for all purposes relevant to the Hours of Service Act,

25

the time spent waiting for the deadhead vehicle is

his argument.

9

They were engaging in

I think that's

What is your response to that?

MR. STEWART:

Well, a couple of responses.

I

10

think first, as to what complaints of abuse were brought

11

before the congressional committee that held the hearings,

12

the union's complaints focused both on the waiting time

13

and on the length of transportation itself.

14

there were statements to the effect that --

15
16

QUESTION:

They didn't draw any distinction,

you're saying.

17

MR. STEWART:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

That is,

No, and --

So that the problem Congress had was

a unified problem.
MR. STEWART:

That's correct, and the Senate

21

committee report stated that part of the problem was that

22

an employee -- several hours of an employee's off-duty

23

time might be time deadheading back from his duty

24

assignment, so clearly -- there's no evidence in the

25

legislative history that Congress believed that the ride

1

in the deadhead vehicle itself was typically short, but

2

that the waiting periods were typically lengthy, so I

3

don't believe that the legislative history provides a

4

basis for distinguishing between the two.

5

The reason that time spent in deadhead

6

transportation is limbo time is that it shares some of the

7

characteristics of both on and off-duty time.

8

the employee is not free to come and go as he pleases.

9

The employee is unlikely to have a meaningful opportunity

That is,

10

for rest, and therefore it would be inappropriate to count

11

this as off-duty time and count it towards the minimum

12

number of consecutive hours of rest that he has to --

QUESTION:

14

15

the second clause in subparagraph (4) was inserted in

response to the concern expressed by the testimony of

Mr. Manion?

18
19

May I just get your view on one, kind

MR. STEWART:

Is it -- do you agree that

I don't know if I would say that

Mr. Manion specifically, but yes, I think --

20

QUESTION:

Just generally.

21

MR. STEWART:

Yes.

The original bill, the bill

22

as originally introduced provided that time deadheading

23

either to or from a duty assignment would be considered

24

on-duty time, and this appears to reflect a -- to define

25

the deadheading from a duty assignment as limbo time

1

appears to reflect a compromise that allayed the concerns

2

of the railroads while ensuring that this would not be

3

treated as off-duty time, thereby depriving the employee

4

of an adequate opportunity for rest.

5

So because the employee is not free to come and

6

go as he pleases, and is unlikely to have a meaningful

7

opportunity for rest, it would be inappropriate to

8

consider this off-duty time.

9

On the other hand, so long as the employee has

10

no duties to perform, his fatigue can pose no danger to

11

himself and others, or others, and therefore it would be

12

inappropriate to treat this as on-duty time, and I think

13

it's instructive to contrast this with the interim periods

14

available for rest that Mr. Mann referred to.

15

That is, the reason that the interim periods are

16

defined as on-duty time is not that the employee poses a

17

danger during those periods himself.

18

wouldn't be the case if the employee is performing no

19

services.

That clearly

20

Rather, the reason is that if these periods are

21

not provided at a place where an employee actually has an

22

adequate opportunity for rest, the employee is likely to

23

be tireder at the end of that period than at the

24

beginning, and therefore they need to be counted as on-

duty time in order to ensure that he's not performing

safety-sensitive tasks more than 12 hours after he

2

initially reported for duty.

3

QUESTION:

4
5

Do you know how many designated

terminals an employee usually has?
MR. STEWART:

Well, typically, I think my

6

understanding is that typically there would be a home

7

terminal and an away-from-home terminal.

8

generally a subject of collective bargaining, and

9

Mr. Johnson may have a more precise answer than I do, so

This is

10

that what is a designated terminal insofar as a particular

11

employee is concerned is defined not by the act, but by

12

the collective bargaining agreement.

13

QUESTION:

But under your view, if the employee

14

waits for deadhead transportation after his duty, when

15

he's off duty, and then goes to a designated terminal

16

which is available for rest under (5), but then he's also

17

waiting for further transportation, I take it that this is

18

on duty, because he has a place to rest, even though he's

19

also waiting for further deadhead transportation.

20

MR. STEWART:

I'm not sure if I understand the

21

question, but our position is that after the employee has

22

been released of the obligation to perform any duties, all

23

of the waiting and the actual riding would be considered

24

limbo time, and the statute speaks of --

1

gets to a place other than a designated terminal and it's

2

available for rest, pursuant to (5), or is that not an

3

interim period?

4

MR. STEWART:

That's not an interim period.

The

5

interim periods would be those that are preceded and

6

followed by periods of service, and again, the reason for

7

treating those periods differently is, if you're going to

8

have to perform services when the period is over, we're
concerned about whether you're going to be tired and pose

10

a safety hazard at that time, but if your tour of duty is

11

up, if you're simply in the process of getting from your

12

duty assignment to the place that you'll get your 8 or 10

13

hours consecutive rest, that concern is not present.

14
15

QUESTION:

I see.

So interim is followed and

preceded by on duty.

16

MR. STEWART:

17

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Mr. Stewart, does the Government

18

assert any entitlement to deference of its views in this

1

case?

20

MR. STEWART:

Yes, we do.

This is -- obviously,

21

this litigation has taken a strange path in the sense that

22

the Government is asserting a different reading of the

23

statute than we asserted in the court of appeals, but the

24

concerns that caused the FRA to shift its position,

before the Court.
That is, in the Seventh Circuit the Government

3

was asserting that the interest in Nation-wide uniformity

4

was so great as to outweigh the interest in choosing the

5

better of the two readings as between two that the FRA

6

considered within the realm of reasonableness.

7

we're in this Court, and that whatever ruling this Court

8

hands down obviously will have Nation-wide application,

9

there's no need to balance any concern for uniformity

11

Given that

against competing interests.
QUESTION:

What that would mean, of course, if

12

we agree with you on the deference point, is that although

13

we -- if we were to find your interpretation reasonable,

14

you could change the interpretation later.

15

though yours was the more reasonable you would still be

able to go to the other one.

MR. STEWART:

I think that's correct.

It would

depend to a certain degree if the Court wrote the opinion,

that could plausibly be asserted --

two, and if the Court --

this point, in the court of appeals the question of

it's concern for Nation-wide uniformity was so great as to

trump its view as to what was the better reading of the

statute, and we -- the FRA in the court of appeals asked

that court to defer to the FRA's view regarding the

importance of Nation-wide uniformity as opposed to the

importance of getting the better of the two answers, so

the two opinions were addressed to that sort of deference.

regarding the FRA's view as to what is the more persuasive

meaning of the statutory language, so the types of things

that Judge Bauer and Judge Easterbrook were debating

resolution of the question.

QUESTION:

They're like ships passing in the

QUESTION:

Mr. Stewart, is there anything in the

record that indicates why the Government didn't appeal the

Ninth Circuit and try to reconcile its views of the better

12

interpretation with national uniformity that way?
MR. STEWART:

13
14

I

think --

15
16

There is nothing in the record.

QUESTION:

I don't wish to go outside it.

just wondered whether there was anything in it.

MR. STEWART:

I would only remark that it was

the first court of appeals ruling that had addressed the

question, and it would be -- there would be nothing in

20

this Court's rules, obviously, that would preclude us from

filing a cert petition or the Court from granting it, but

22

it would not be consistent with the Court's normal

practice.

is, if you still persisted in thinking the other view the

2

better one, why wouldn't it have been worth the

3

Government's while at least to persist in one other

4

circuit to get a conflict and get the thing up here?

5

MR. STEWART:

Again, these go to questions of

6

both litigation strategy and also the FRA's view as to the

7

importance of uniformity as of a particular moment.

8

9

Certainly a reasonable person could believe that
that would have been the better course.

Obviously, the

10

reasonableness of that decision is not before the Court at

11

this stage.

12

QUESTION:

You do agree that, if there's any

13

duty assigned, like watch the train to see that there's no

14

vandalism, that that's full on-duty time.

15

MR. STEWART:

That's correct.

16

With respect to the vandalism point, I would

17

like to distinguish between two types of instructions that

18

an employee could be given.

19

watch for vandalism, be alert, be vigilant, that is

20

clearly on-duty time.

21

do whatever you want, read, play cards, sleep, but if you

22

happen to see vandalism you have an obligation to report

it, we wouldn't regard the reading, sleeping, et cetera

MR. STEWART:

employee back into duty, these people are always in radio

employee to do a particular thing, so whenever the
10

employee is in this waiting period, there always exists

11

the possibility of being recalled to duty whatever the

12

instructions he was given at the outset of that period.

13

The only other point I'd like to make is that I

14

think our reading of the statute is buttressed by the

15

other point at which time spent in deadhead transportation

16

is used in the same section of the Hours of Service Act.

17

That is, the act provides that time spent in

18

deadhead transportation to a duty assignment is considered

1

time on duty, and I feel quite certain that the union

20

would state that time spent in deadhead transportation to

21

a duty assignment includes any waiting period between the

22

time that the employee reports and the time that the

23

deadhead vehicle is actually ready to go.

24
25

That's buttressed by the structure of the
statute and by the legislative history, which the Senate

report states that time spent in deadhead transportation

2

to a duty assignment is to be calculated from the time an

confirmation of the fact that the waiting period is

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD M. JOHNSON

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RAILROAD RESPONDENTS
MR. JOHNSON:

12

13
14

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
Before the Ninth Circuit ruling, there was --

15

the statutory scheme was administered in a very

16

straightforward, simple manner, predictable and certainty

17

for the railroad in how to schedule crews and operate

18

their trains.

19

The very simple rule that the Hours of Service

20

Act provided was that you could operate the crew up to

21

12 hours, but if you realized, if you saw that the train

22

was not going to make its intended terminal, all you had

23

to do to avoid a violation of the act was notify the crew

24

to identify a place where they could pull over, park the

25

train, and then they were relieved from all other duty.
44

At that point, all they had to do was wait for

1
2

transportation to arrive, which typically also brought the

3

relief crew as well.

4

took the train on to its terminal, then the expired or

5

outlawed crew would be transported to its place of final

6

release.

7
8

Now, one thing I'd like to make clear right here
is

9
10

The relief crew got on the train,

QUESTION:
an outlawed crew?

What do you call them?

Is that the industry terminology?

MR. JOHNSON:

11

You call them

There's a lot of industry jargon,

12

Your Honor, and the crew is outlawed at that point in

13

time.

14

called the dog-catcher, to pick lip the outlawed train.

The crew sometimes sent out to pick it up was

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. JOHNSON:

Now, one thing I'd like to point

17

out here is a difference between us and the unions, one

18

among many differences, is that they try and argue that

19

under the statute the crew is on duty until it reaches its

20

place of final release, which is the terminal that it

21

didn't make, but that's not the way the statute works.

22

The language is quite clear that on duty runs

23

from the time you report for duty until you're finally

24

released from duty, and you're finally released from duty

25

under the statute when the railroad dispatcher advises the

crew you're relieved from duty, don't do anything else.

2

Now, I believe in response to a question from

Justice Breyer was asked, are these crews paid while

4

they're in limbo time, and the answer is yes, they are

5

paid all throughout this time.

waiting for deadhead transportation.

MR. JOHNSON:

From the time

20

they report to duty -- I mean, typically there's a

21

train -- they try and schedule it so the train is there

22

ready for them to get on board and go on, but if the train

23

hasn't come in yet, that time period they're waiting to

24

assume duty and that's counted as on-duty time.

25

But to come back to the point I was going to

make about the pay, all that happens at the place of final

2

release, they don't have any more duties because they've

3

been relieved from duty on the train, they have no duties

4

while they're waiting for deadhead transportation, they

5

have no duties while they're in the taxicab or the van, or

6

another train, perhaps, but they're being paid, and when

7

they get to the place of final release, all that is, is

8

they clock out.

9

That's all final release means.

When they get to their terminal, they clock out.

10

That stops the pay, and it starts their rest period,

11

because the railroad has to know when the rest period

12

begins so they can be called again.

13

Now, there aren't any abuses here.

I know the

14

union attorney talks about abuses in the record, but there

15

really is no record here other than what was put before

16

the agency by the railroads, because the union did not put

17

anything in the record other than the stuff they've

18

attached to their briefs.

19

But even if there were abuses here, the abuses

20

were whatever they were related to deadhead

21

transportation, and they've all been addressed by the fact

22

that waiting for deadhead transportation and the deadhead

23

transportation itself is not counted towards the rest

24

period, and therefore, when they get to the end, when they

25

get to the place of final release, they get their full

Now, it's been very hard for the railroads to

try and comply with this new interpretation, and that is

2 hours -- it just can't be done.
QUESTION:

What penalties are there for

7

violating -- I mean, I can imagine you might have a

8

snowstorm or something, and you can just stop the train,

9

but if that unforeseen delay causes your crew to be on

20

duty longer than you had expected, what would the

21

penalties be?

22

MR. JOHNSON:

Well, the penalties, the minimum

23

penalty to be imposed is $500 per violation.

24

penalty is $20,000 per violation.

25

crew member is a violation, so if you have three members

That would be three

Now, the agency has discretion above $500 how

much to impose.

Currently, what they've been imposing is

$1,000 per violation, so each of these crews typically has

a crew of two or three people, it's $2,000 or $3,000 per

violation.

Now, the problem here is, it's impossible --

9

QUESTION:

Of course, they might make an

10

exception for snowstorms.

11

the union's view of the matter, there -- couldn't we count

12

on the agency's discretion not to impose the penalty when

13

indeed the reason the excessive time occurred was simply

14

some unforeseen event such as a snowstorm?

15

MR. JOHNSON:

You know, even if we adopted

Yes, Your Honor.

They have

16

that -- I think it's a matter of prosecutorial discretion,

17

and also there's a specific exception in the statute for

18

emergency situation acts of God.

19

But what's happening right now in the Ninth

20

Circuit, because they still feel compelled to apply this

21

interpretation of the Ninth Circuit, in the States within

22

the Ninth Circuit, the railroads are continuing to be

23

assessed violations for this waiting time.

24

the waiting time periods are as little as 5 minutes, we're

25

still being faced with penalties right now.

after they've received their full rest period, and -QUESTION:

2

Well, of course,

I mean, you know, an

3

argument can be made for the other side.

4

is -- what is the rest period that's -- what's the minimum

rest period?
MR. JOHNSON:

6

The argument

The minimum rest period is

7

8 hours.

8

12 hours, it is 10 hours under the statute.

If they work right up to the maximum of

QUESTION:

Okay.

MR. JOHNSON:

10

Now, that rest period doesn't

11

begin -- what happens when they reach -- you know, there's

12

all this railroad industry jargon in the statute, but

13

again, the place of final release simply means the

14

building that they walk into when they clock out.

15

That means they're going to begin their rest

16

period, and what they do then is, if they're -- I believe

17

one of the justices asked how many terminals they have.

18

They have the home terminal -- the home terminal, of

19

course, they live at their home, but when they get to

20

their away-from-home terminal, the railroad has made

21

arrangements -- it's in the collective bargaining

agreement.

bargaining agreements -- has made arrangements for a hotel

24

to go to and stuff, and that's where they get their rest.

This is all treated in the collective

statute show that Congress thought that an 8-hour rest

2

period is needed for a -- what, 10-hour normal work

3

period?

4

MR. JOHNSON:

5

QUESTION:

6

But a 10-hour rest period is needed

for a 12-hour work period, is that right?

7

MR. JOHNSON:

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes.

So the law -- you can't say there's

just an absolute rest period which is going to be a balm

10

for all ills, no matter how long you've been on -- you

11

know, working before then, and what the union is saying is

12

look, realistically, traveling, deadheading back is -- it

13

takes it out of you, and if I should get 10 hours' rest

14

for 12 hours' duty, I should also get 10 hours' rest for

15

10 hours of duty plus 2 hours of deadheading back,

16

including the waiting time for the deadheading.

17

know that that's an unreasonable argument.

I don't

18

I mean, the minimum time is a minimum time that

19

has been calculated on the basis of what the maximum duty

20

time was, and if that duty time is stretched out, maybe --

21

you know, maybe the minimum time should be more.

22

MR. JOHNSON:

Your Honor, they have a way to get

23

that, and the way they get that is expressly addressed in

24

the statute, and that is through collective bargaining.

25

Congress specifically says in section 2107 of the Hours of

Service Act that these are minimums, and nothing is to

2

stop the parties from sitting down and collectively-

3

bargaining longer rest periods, and --

5

QUESTION:

This is a safety issue, they say, and

Congress -- you know, Congress was concerned with safety.
MR. JOHNSON:

6

That's true, Your Honor, and

7

Congress, though, has made the judgment that safety is

8

satisfied here.
If we limit the crews to 12 hours on duty, if we

10

make transportation time limbo time, and if we mandate a

11

minimum rest period of 8 hours, Congress has made a

12

judgment that that satisfies the safety concern, and if

13

the parties want to go beyond that minimum they can and,

14

in fact, they have, and some collective bargaining

15

agreements provide that the minimum rest period is, in all

16

instances is 10 hours rather than 8 hours.
And the safety issue, though, here that the

17

18

unions are complaining about is not the safety issue of

1

waiting time, it's not the safety issue of how long the

20

day is.

21

again, the safety problem they're worried about is fatigue

22

from irregular work hours, upsetting Circadian rhythms

23

because crews are being called at all hours of the day and

24

night to man trains, and that's true.

25

railroad business works.

You bread their brief, and over and over and over

That's the way the

1

But that is not a safety issue that's addressed

2

by this statute, because even if you counted waiting time

3

as limbo time, that doesn't affect the fact that the crew,

4

when it gets back and after it's had its rest, could be

5

called again at any hour of the day or night to man that

6

train.

7

QUESTION:

Indeed, it's purely fortuitous

8

whether it helps that problem or hurts that problem.

9

could help it.

10

MR. JOHNSON:

It

That's correct, Your Honor, and

11

again, the parties are meeting together in task force to

12

address the safety issues that may result from these

13

irregular work schedules, and Congress last year did add

14

an amendment to the Hours of Service Act that encouraged

15

the parties to work together to develop a solution, if

16

there is a problem here, on irregular work hours.

17

But there's not a safety problem here with

18

treating waiting time as limbo time, and the Government

19

made a reasonable choice in a somewhat ambiguous term

20

whether to treat it -- that's one difference we have with

21

the Government.

22

how to treat this waiting time.

23

as off-duty time or limbo time, and the Government made a

24

reasonable choice to treat it as limbo time.

25

way this statute has operated for more than 20 years, and

We believe there are only two options on

we believe that's the correct application of the statute.
QUESTION:

2

May I ask one very important

3

question?

The term dog-catcher refers to the crew that

4

picks up the outlawed crew, or to the crew that

5

substitutes for it?
MR. JOHNSON:

6

That picks -- that refers to the

7

crew that comes out from the terminal to pick up the train

8

that got outlawed because it fell short of its final
destination because the first crew outlawed --
