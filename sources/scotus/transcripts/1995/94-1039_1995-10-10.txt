CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Tymkovich.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY M. TYMKOVICH

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

9

MR. TYMKOVICH:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

10

This case involves a challenge to the authority

11

of a State to allocate certain law-making power among its

12

State and local governments.

13

reserves to the State the decision of whether to extend

14

special protections under State law on the basis of

15

homosexual or bisexual conduct or orientation.

16

Colorado's Amendment 2

The sole question here is whether in this facial

17

challenge that statewide reservation of authority should

18

be nullified under this Court's prior holdings in James v.

19

Valtierra and Hunter v. Erickson.

20

That question can be authoritatively resolved

21

for two core reasons.

First, the logic and holding of

22

James is indistinguishable and controls here.

23

the rationality of the substantive policy judgment that

24

has so far motivated Congress and other States in deciding

25

not to extend title VII protections or other -- to

Secondly,

1

homosexuals and bisexuals similarly supports the decision

2

of Colorado to reserve that question to itself on a

3

statewide basis.

4

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Tymkovich --

5

QUESTION:

It may be, counsel, that we have to

6

reach that question, but it seems to me there is a

7

predicate or a preliminary matter that we ought to discuss

8

at some point during your oral argument.

9

Usually when we have an equal protection

10

question we measure the objective of the legislature

11

against the class that is adopted, against the statutory

12

classification.

13

Here, the classification seems to be adopted for

14

its own sake.

15

any precedent that you can cite to the Court where we've

16

upheld a law such as this?

17

I've never seen a case like this.

MR. TYMKOVICH:

Is there

Your Honor, in James v.

18

Valtierra the Court was presented with a question

19

involving a State constitutional amendment that also

20

identified a classification -- in that case, low-income

21

persons -- and in analyzing the question there, the Court

22

fundamentally looked at whether Hunter v. Erickson should

23

extend beyond the specific racial context in which it was

24

decided.

25

QUESTION:

But the whole point in James was that

1

we knew that it was low-income housing, and we could

2

measure the need, the importance, the objectives of the

3

legislature to control low-cost housing against the

4

classification that was adopted.

5

Here, the classification is just adopted for its

6

own sake, with reference to all purposes of the law, so

7

James doesn't work.

8

9

MR. TYMKOVICH:

The classification in James did

involve a reference to a specific subset of persons, an

10

identifiable group under the theory of the Colorado

11

supreme court.

12

QUESTION:

I know it adopted a theory of a

13

group, but it was with reference to a specific legislative

14

objective -- low-cost housing.

15

Here, the classification is adopted to fence

16

out, in the Colorado supreme court's words, the class for

17

all purposes, and I've never seen a statute like that.

18

MR. TYMKOVICH:

Your Honor, the objective here

19

was to resolve an issue of whether or not to extend

20

special protections to homosexuals and bisexuals, so the

21

issue resolved here --

22

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Tymkovich, the language of

23

the amendment I guess has never been actually interpreted

24

by the Colorado courts.

3

QUESTION:

Has it been construed or interpreted

as yet, in your view?
MR. TYMKOVICH:

Your Honor, this is a facial

4

challenge, and the provision was enjoined before it ever

5

went into effect.

6

QUESTION:

Right.

7

MR. TYMKOVICH:

For bases of this appeal, the

8

Colorado court did make an interpretation that at least to

9

the extent that it preempted local laws and State

10
11

provisions, that's all the farther it went.
QUESTION:

Well, does it mean that homosexuals

12

are not covered by Colorado's laws of general

13

applicability?

14

MR. TYMKOVICH:

15

QUESTION:

No, it does not.

How do we know that?

In the -I mean, the

16

literal language would indicate that, for example, a

17

public library could refuse to allow books to be borrowed

18

by homosexuals and there would be no relief from that,

19

apparently.

20

MR. TYMKOVICH:

There are a couple of reasons.

21

First, in the second opinion of the Colorado supreme

22

court, what I'll call Evans 2, the Colorado supreme court

23

did, in footnote 9 of that opinion, make reference to some

24

general laws of general applicability and found that those

25

would not be displaced by Amendment 2.

Secondly, the --

QUESTION:

Does it displace courts in Colorado?

Can a court hear a 1983 case in Colorado --

MR. TYMKOVICH:

QUESTION:

7

MR. TYMKOVICH:

Absolutely.

-- dealing with discrimination -Yes, it may. There --

-- if there's a homosexual plaintiff?
It absolutely changes no

8

provisions under Federal law in access to the court or

9

vindication of one's equal protection rights, nor does it

10

affect the State --

11

QUESTION:

Well, how do we know that?

I mean, I

12

don't read anything in the opinion that tells me what the

13

thing means.

14

MR. TYMKOVICH:

The construction that we have

15

offered is well supported by the legislative history and

16

the intent of the proponents.

17

clearly on its face refers to State enactments and State

18

policies and does not displace any Federal law or policy.

19

We think that the law

The ballot analysis which we presented in our

20

appendix to the petition makes it clear that this was not

21

intended to extend beyond State and local laws, so it's

22

our view that under the Supremacy Clause as well as under

23

a plain interpretation of the amendment, that Federal law

24

would not be disrupted.

25

QUESTION:

Moreover --

Mr. Tymkovich, even focusing on State

1

law alone, Federal law is of course supreme.

2

MR. TYMKOVICH:

3

QUESTION:

Yes.

And as Justice Kennedy pointed out,

4

James v. Valtierra dealt with one issue, low-cost housing.

5

There were dozens of other ways in which to improve the

6

status of the poor, to fight against the blight of

7

poverty.

8

9

But here, it's everything -- thou shalt not have
access to the ordinary legislative process for anything

10

that will improve the condition of this particular

11

group -- and I would like to know whether in all of U.S.

12

history there has been any legislation like this that

13

earmarks a group and says, you will not be able to appeal

14

to your State legislature to improve your status.

15

will need a constitutional change to do that.

16

MR. TYMKOVICH:

You

Your Honor, it's not

17

unprecedented in the sense that it's a preemptive law.

18

is unusual to the extent that two strands of the law come

19

together, but the Court's cases have made it clear that

20

it's appropriate to withdraw authority over certain issues

21

from a local level to a higher level of State government.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Tymkovich, what about laws

23

prohibiting bigamy, or prohibiting homosexuality, or

24

homosexual conduct?

25

It

Incidentally, how do you interpret the bisexual

1

orientation language, homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual

2

orientation?

3

a disposition?

4

Does that require any conduct, or is it just

MR. TYMKOVICH:

It's unclear from this text.

5

However, the reason that that language is in Amendment 2

6

is because this was a plain response to certain laws that

7

had been enacted by State and local government that used

8

the term bisexual, but it could include either conduct or

9

orientation.

10

Again, it's unclear how you determine --

QUESTION:

I want to know what you mean by --

11

what is meant by - - if all orientation means is someone

12

who engages in homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual acts, then

13

you have plenty of precedent in response to your question,

14

namely State laws that absolutely criminalize such

15

activity -- bigamy, homosexuality --

16

MR. TYMKOVICH:

17

QUESTION:

That's right, the --

Colorado has no law that prohibits

consensual homosexual conduct.
MR. TYMKOVICH:

No.

Colorado repealed its

sodomy law in 1972, but to answer --

QUESTION:

Well --

Yes.

We believe that conduct is

QUESTION:

6

Well, is it the sole indicator?

Are

7

you representing to this Court that Colorado's position is

8

that the class defining characteristic is conduct as

9

opposed to preference or proclivity or whatnot?
MR. TYMKOVICH:

10
11

immaterial to the litigation below.
There was an attempt by the respondents to prove

12

13

No, Your Honor, because that was

a suspect class --

14

QUESTION:

Well then we have to do one of two

15

things.

16

something more than conduct, or if there were a serious

17

question, I suppose we would have to send it back and ask

18

the courts of Colorado to tell us, but is there a serious

19

question?

We have to assume that orientation means

20

MR. TYMKOVICH:

21

serious question that --

22

QUESTION:

I don't think that there's a

So that orientation means something

23

more than conduct, and we have to assume that in ruling on

this challenge, don't we?

the legal position of the State with respect to this

2

classification.

3

QUESTION:

May I go back to one point that you

4

have made, and you've made it more than once about the --

5

I guess about the legal position of the State.

6

You've referred to the issue as the

7

permissibility of withdrawing subject matter from

8

political consideration at a certain level.

9

has been reserved for a higher level of political action.

10

You said it

It seems to me that there are two things wrong

11

with that characterization.

12

brought up, and that is, this is not merely a reservation

13

for this particular subject to be dealt with, for example,

14

by statewide referendum.

15

no law may be made addressing, or addressing for

16

protective purposes this kind of discrimination.

17

One of them has already been

It is in fact a provision that

The second thing that seems to me inaccurate

18

about the characterization you're giving us is that this

19

is not merely a reservation of a subject matter.

20

not the subject of the claim.

21

a discrimination in the reservation of the subject matter,

22

or a discrimination in the provision for eligibility, or

23

exercise of legislative power.

25

That is

The claim is that there is

It seems to me that as you characterize it, it
would sound like a due process challenge, but in fact it's

1

an equal protection challenge, because there's a

2

discrimination involved.

3

MR. TYMKOVICH:

Isn't that correct?
Your Honor, there is a

4

classification involved, but there is no invidious

5

discrimination.

All the fact that the law --

6

QUESTION:

What does invidious mean?

7

MR. TYMKOVICH:

I think it means an arbitrary or

8

irrational classification, and that is not the case here.

9

I think we've shown that there are reasons for the

10
11

classification.
QUESTION:

But in any case, you recognize that

12

this is not the same problem that might be raised if a

13

certain subject matter, e.g., discrimination, were

14

reserved for legislative action at the State level rather

15

than local level.

16

This is a different problem, isn't it?

MR. TYMKOVICH:

I think it's an equal protection

17

problem, but the question is, does it impinge on a suspect

class here - -

QUESTION:

20

MR. TYMKOVICH:

Right, but it's --- or has there been some type

reservation of a broad spectrum of action for political

QUESTION:

6

Well, are you saying then -- maybe

7

this is what you're saying, that if the equal protection

challenge is in fact recognized or vindicated here, that

9

there is no way to prevent this from in effect ballooning

10

into a due process challenge, that if they win this, then

11

a different kind of claim will also succeed, i.e., a claim

12

that a certain subject matter, discrimination or not, must

13

be dealt with for purposes of Federal law at a certain

14

level of government?

15
16

Is that your argument?

MR. TYMKOVICH:

No, Your Honor.

We don't

It's not a slippery slope argument.

You're not saying we go from -- if an equal protection

It's

not a question of who can do it, but the State itself

can't do it through the ordinary legislative process.

QUESTION:

Mr. Tymkovich, I was trying to think

15

of something comparable to this, and what occurred to me

16

is that this political means of going at the local level

17

first is familiar in American politics.

18

In fact, it was the way that the suffragists

19

worked.

20

statewide, they did it on a cities first approach, and I

21

take it from what you are arguing that if there had been a

22

referendum that said no local ordinance can give women the

vote, that that would have been constitutional.

QUESTION:

2

Yes, and that's what you're urging

here.
MR. TYMKOVICH:

3

Yes.

We're urging for this

4

classification, that the Court engage in a rational basis

5

type of review.
No court has found homosexual orientation or

6

7

conduct to be a suspect classification.

8

traditional equal protection model should be applied in

9

this case.

10

QUESTION:

Therefore, the

Mr. Tymkovich, what is now required

11

under Colorado law, assuming that the constitutionality of

12

this is upheld, in order to change that provision?

13

would be what, a statewide referendum?

14

MR. TYMKOVICH:

That's right, Your Honor.

It

There

15

would be an initiative, or a referred measure from our

16

State legislature, and it would be placed on the ballot in

17

the same fashion that the Amendment 2 was placed on the

18

ballot in the first instance, so there would be that mere

19

opportunity for the opponents of Amendment 2, just like

20

there were for the proponents.

21

And to further answer Justice Ginsburg's

22

question, what the respondents here are saying is that

23

those who oppose certain type of special protections here

24

cannot get their policy preference vindicated through the

25

legislative process unless they are able to successfully

MR. TYMKOVICH:

1

The rationale is any law of

general preemption that wants to make a substantive

decision, and the people here, the rational basis for that

substantive decision in our view was a political response

to what the people might have perceived as laws going too

far or being too intrusive.

What this does is

QUESTION:

9

Well, the State of Virginia has a

very broad State preemption doctrine.

Local governments

10

do not have the power in Virginia that they do in many

11

other places.

just that the people generally would prefer to have the

rules set by the State at large rather than by local

I suppose the rational basis for that is

That's correct, Your Honor, and

address, and how does your answer to Justice Stevens

quintessential political judgment on how you provide

relative protection to relative groups.

QUESTION:

Well, it's a judgment that is made

politically, but that doesn't state a rational basis.
I mean, if we were saying -- if we were asking

in Colorado at the State level rather than the local

I think there are some particular discrete

This issue was seen as particularly desirable

for a statewide uniform determination.

There's a question

about the desirability of each local jurisdiction dealing

with this issue, which I think raises some very

fundamental and sensitive cultural, moral, political

concerns for our State.

any further than simply the answer, that's what they

justification independent merely of majority will, which

MR. TYMKOVICH:

It depends

upon the circumstance.

simply that if a private person can often act arbitrarily,

Let me ask you, counsel, getting away

from the wording in the provisions of this amendment,

suppose that Colorado is concerned that one city has

passed an ordinance giving preference to gays in

employment hiring, and for any number of reasons the

MS. DUBOFSKY:

This law is much broader than

supreme court is that the law covers homosexual

rely on not that it covers orientation rather than just

conduct, but that it in effect fences people out of a

political process?

MS. DUBOFSKY:

5

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And I guess that takes me back to

6

your answer to, I guess it was Justice O'Connor, in which

7

you said the constitutional defect was the manner in

8

which, or a general constitutional defect would be

9

targeting homosexuals.

10

MS. DUBOFSKY:

11

QUESTION:

Yes.

That's not really your position, is

12

it, because if there were an ordinance -- let's say there

13

were an ordinance in a given city saying there will be no

14

discrimination based on age, handicap, or sexual

15

orientation, and there were a political move in that city

16

to repeal the reference to sexual orientation, that would

17

be targeted at homosexuals, but it would not run afoul of

what I understand your position to be here, is that

correct?

MS. DUBOFSKY:

I'm not certain I understand what

you're driving at.

Look, if -- you've got an ordinance

MS. DUBOFSKY:

QUESTION:

Yes.

Is that a violation of equal

protection?

MS. DUBOFSKY:

No.

6

QUESTION:

Okay.

7

QUESTION:

Ms. Dubofsky, supposing that in

8

Colorado, shortly before the enactment of this ordinance,

9

there had been agitation, say, by dissident Mormon sects

10

to repeal the prohibition against polygamy that I assume

11

Colorado has, and so there's a referendum that says -- the

12

Colorado constitution says polygamy will always be a

13

felony in the State of Colorado, now, does that fence out

14

these people who would like to see polygamy allowed?
MS. DUBOFSKY:

15

Not necessarily, because that's

16

really dealing with much more of a discrete issue.

17

not a restructuring of the political process.

18

QUESTION:

It's

But there -- well, there -- it's

repealed.

if they were agitating before the

That's correct, but the

particular issue involved is having to do with the

identity of the group of people who are engaging in

polygamy, and it's prohibiting polygamy.
The best way I can answer that question is to

2

say, if you substituted bigamists or polygamists into the

4

language of Amendment 2, then you would have a problem, as

we point out, but here -QUESTION:

MS. DUBOFSKY:

9
10

What sort of a problem would you

You would have a problem of

denying people the fundamental right to participate in the
political process.
QUESTION:

11

Well, so then you say that Colorado

12

cannot say in its constitution either polygamy or bigamy

13

will always be a felony.

MS. DUBOFSKY:

people on a personal characteristic, and -QUESTION:

Well, but surely the dissident sects

3

that want to practice polygamy are a particular group of

4

people, too.

5

MS. DUBOFSKY:

That's correct.

What they're not

being deprived of is a whole category of laws that provide

7

them a benefit, the opportunity to seek protection from

discrimination or a similar --

QUESTION:

Well, but maybe this is essential to

MS. DUBOFSKY:

Well, then it would come under a

whole different way of analyzing the issue, and that would

13

be whether it deprived them of a First Amendment - -

QUESTION:

Ms. Dubofsky, do you contend that --

are you asking us to overrule Bowers v. Hardwick?

16

MS. DUBOFSKY:

17

QUESTION:

No, I am not.

Well, there we said that you could

18

make homosexual conduct criminal.

19

take a step short of that and say, we're not going to make

20

it criminal, but on the other hand, we certainly don't

21

want to encourage it, and therefore we will neither have a

22

State law giving it special protection, nor will we allow

23

any municipalities to give it special protection.

24
25

Why can a State not

It seems to me the legitimacy of the one follows
from the legitimacy of the other.

If you can criminalize

1

it, surely you can take that latter step, can't you?
MS. DUBOFSKY:

2

What you've done is deprived

3

people, based on their homosexual orientation, of a whole

4

opportunity to seek protection from discrimination, which

5

is a very different thing.
QUESTION:

6

7

So do you do it when you throw them

in jail for a felony?

8

MS. DUBOFSKY:

9

QUESTION:

No --

I'm not talking about orientation,

10

now.

I'm talking about conduct.

11

constitutional to make the conduct criminal, how could it

12

be unconstitutional to go so much short of that?

13

If we have held it

We don't want to get into the hassle of

14

intrusion into private life, and all of that, that that

15

requires.

16

other hand, we do not think it is conduct that ought to be

17

encouraged, and therefore we will not allow any special

18

protections for it, neither at the State level, nor

19

locally.

We're not going to criminalize it.

Doesn't -- if the one is constitutional, must
not the other one be?
MS. DUBOFSKY:

If homosexuals were put into the

engage in homosexual conduct shall not be entitled to ever

seek protection under the civil rights laws, we would say

1

that is unconstitutional.

2

from saying that you can criminalize homosexual sodomy.
QUESTION:

3

That's a very different thing

But isn't it also true that this law

4

applies to this class of people even if they abstain from

5

the prohibited conduct?

6

MS. DUBOFSKY:

That's correct, and it also could

7

apply to people who aren't gay, but who may be perceived

8

to be gay and are discriminated against on that basis.
QUESTION:

9

Ms. Dubofsky, if we could go back to

10

the question Justice Kennedy was asking, I take it your

11

answer to him was, your objection is to the permanency,

12

the bar to access to the political process to get

13

something changed.

14

MS. DUBOFSKY:

15

QUESTION:

16

That's correct.

But you're not objecting to the State

saying, we repeal all existing ordinances.

17

MS. DUBOFSKY:

That's correct, and that's

18

because the case law and the fundamental right to

19

political participation says a simple repealer is all

20

right.

21

QUESTION:

Then how do you answer Justice

22

Kennedy's further question, well, isn't the State entitled

23

to end a ping pong game?

24

State repeals it.

25

repeals it again.

MS. DUBOFSKY:

1

The constitutional bar, in

2

effect, to ever adopting a protection of any sort, or an

3

opportunity to seek protection from discrimination, is

4

very different type of barrier than a simple repealer and

5

reenactment, because it means that if the group is going

6

to ever obtain any protection, it has to amend the State

7

constitution first.

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Yes, but wouldn't you say that it

could end the ping pong ball that way if it ends it with
respect to all protection against private discrimination?

11

MS. DUBOFSKY:

12

QUESTION:

13

That's correct, it could.

That would not be an equal protection

problem.

14

MS. DUBOFSKY:

15

QUESTION:

That's right.

That's right.

So you're saying, if I understand

you, you just can't end the ping pong ball for this
