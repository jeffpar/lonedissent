ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

We'll hear argument

MS. O'SULLIVAN:

Thank you, Your Honor, and may

it please the Court:
The Alaska trial court rejected petitioner's

14

challenge for the admission of his confession under

15

Miranda v. Arizona, holding that petitioner was not in

16

custody for Miranda purposes and therefore was not

17

entitled to warnings prior to the interrogation that led

18

to his confession.

19

Petitioner was convicted, exhausted his State

20

remedy, sought a writ of habeas corpus in the United

21

States District Court for the District of Alaska, and was

22

denied relief.

23

On appeal, the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding

24

that the State trial court's conclusion that petitioner

25

was not in custody constituted a finding of fact entitled

title 28 of the United States Code.

3

that we challenge here.

4

of

It is that ruling

In a case where all the historical facts are

5

conceded,

the application of the objective Miranda custody-

6

standard to these facts constitutes a mixed question that

7

should be reviewed de novo under this Court's decision in

8

Miller v. Fenton.
The Miller decision controls here.

If one

examines the process by which a custody determination is

made.

In Justice White's words, who did what

Yes, Your Honor, I --

How about cases like Maggio and

Rushen, Patton v. Yount?

strictly historical fact is involved there, isn't it?

MS. O'SULLIVAN:

Surely they're -- just more than

Your Honor, I do not believe

so.

11

cases, constitute cases that look nominally like mixed

12

questions but essentially the Court, in reducing what

13

constitutes the legal standard in that case, has reduced

14

them to questions of historical fact concerning the state

15

of mind of a particular actor.

16

Those cases, the jury bias, competency, and intent

In such circumstances, Your Honor, there is no

MS. O'SULLIVAN:

1

Yes, Your Honor.

It's our

2

contention that the first step in the process, the

3

determination of historical facts, would be accorded a

4

section 2254(d) presumption of correctness.

The second --

QUESTION:

7

we treat it really as a question of fact for a jury?
MS. O'SULLIVAN:

8

9

Well, in the negligence context, do

Your Honor, I believe in the

negligence context the question of whether -- how a

10

reasonable person acted really is a mixed question, and it

11

asks for legal determination --

12

13
14

QUESTION:

But we don't treat it that way, do

we?
MS. O'SULLIVAN:

No, that's correct, Your Honor.

15

It is generally given to the jury to decide.

16

this Court held last term in Gouden, a jury is not only

17

confined to factfinding.

18

the jury is required to make legal determinations, to

19

apply the law to facts, and the considerations that

20

prevail in according a mixed question to a jury as opposed

21

to a judge in a negligence situation are different than

22

the kinds of considerations that one must consider in

23

allocating between the trial judge and the appellate judge

24

in a certain circumstance.

However, as

There are often situations when

supposing one were to draft a statute to deal with this
2

kind of subject directly rather than the general aim, what

3

is gained when all we're talking about what would a

4

reasonable person think by pulling all the powers of the

5

Federal courts to make that final determination?

6

I mean, there's nothing peculiarly Federal about

7

the determination of what is a reasonable person.

8

courts make that sort of determination every day, as

9

Justice O'Connor has suggested.

10

MS. O'SULLIVAN:

Yes, Your Honor, they make that

11

determination with respect to negligence and other State

12

law issues.

respect to a very important threshold issue regarding

They're not making that determination with

Federal constitutional procedures.

QUESTION:

17

Well, Federal constitutional

You're saying Miranda is constitutional?

MS. O'SULLIVAN:

Your Honor, I'm saying that

18

Miranda is necessary to safeguard an essential Fifth

19

Amendment trial right, as the Court found in Withrow.

20

While the Miranda standard may itself not be

21

constitutional, it is at least quasi constitutional

22

because of its relationship to the Fifth Amendment trial

23

rights.

MS. O'SULLIVAN:

QUESTION:

3

(Laughter.)

4

MS. O'SULLIVAN:

Your Honor

Maybe you should ask us.

Your Honor, I think that -- the

5

Court has said the Miranda right in terms of its

6

constitutional, quasi constitutional status, clearly

7

distinguishes it from the negligence situation.
QUESTION:

8

10

Is there something unusual about the

mixed fact law question involving a reasonable person
standard?
In the run-of-the-mill mixed fact and law

11
12

question that goes to a jury, the judge instructs the jury

13

on the content of the law.

14

cases, the judge doesn't.

15

know, would a reasonable person feel this way, and in

16

effect the practice, I think throughout the United States,

17

is that the reasonable person is for the jury to

18

determine.

19

gives the content to the law.

20

In reasonable-person kind of
The judge simply says, you

There is -- it's a case in which the jury

Does that argue for -- I know you would still

21

have the argument saying, well, it should still be a

22

Federal reasonable person, and therefore Federal courts

23

ought to review, but that does put the reasonable person

24

kind of mixed law or fact question in sort of a different

25

status from the usual mixed question, doesn't it?

The judge simply says, is it reasonable

MS. O'SULLIVAN:
QUESTION:

Well --

So they figure out what the

reasonable as distinct from the average person does.
MS. O'SULLIVAN:

Their object is to figure out,

13

given community standards, what is reasonable in the

14

circumstance.

In the current --

QUESTION:

So that would be a - - at least that

16

would be one reason for holding this to be an unreviewable

17

question of fact classifying it as such, not being there

18

isn't an element of law there, but because that element of

19

law is really left to the jury to supply the content of.

20

And then you would come back, I take it, to your

21

second argument and say, if you're going to keep control

22

of Miranda, you've got to make sure that this jury

23

construct is at least a Federal one, and so you -- for

24

that reason, you -- the Federal court still ought to

25

review it, but there would be an argument for saying no

MS. O'SULLIVAN:

Your Honor, I would disagree

with that, respectfully.
What the jury is applying in a negligence

situation is community standards.

a Miranda context is required to apply in assessing

7

reasonableness in a certain circumstance are the Fifth

8

Amendment values underlying Miranda.

QUESTION:

What a Federal judge in

That is something

Well, what Fifth Amendment values are

11

involved in determining whether or not a reasonable person

12

would have thought he was free to leave?

13

MS. O'SULLIVAN:

Your Honor, what the Court has

14

looked to in Berkemer, Mathis, and a number of other cases

15

cited in our brief, is whether the circumstances

16

constitute a sufficient threat to a defendant's or a

17

suspect's free exercise of their Fifth Amendment rights so

18

as to require that Miranda warnings be provided --

19

QUESTION:

Well, but not -- I don't believe

20

that's an accurate statement of our definitions of

21

custody, which is admittedly only a prong of the Miranda

22

test, but it simply is a reasonable -- would a reasonable

23

person have felt free to leave the site of the

24

interrogation?

1

interpreting what a reasonable person would think, the

2

Court is essentially saying what -- in looking at the

3

values underlying Miranda that I've stated and determining

4

what the rules should be, given those values, it's not

5

simply looking to a factual determination of whether he

6

was handcuffed to a table.

7

QUESTION:

I think you're wrong,

8

Ms. O'Sullivan -- you certainly can disagree with me -- in

9

suggesting that all of our cases say that some kind of

10

supersophisticated inquiry based on Fifth Amendment

11

value -- I can certainly think of cases which have simply

12

repeated the phrase, did the defendant feel free to leave,

13

would a person in the defendant's position have felt free

14

to leave, without going through all the other mumbo-jumbo.

15

MS. O'SULLIVAN:

Your Honor, there are cases

16

where the Court was much more terse in its explanation for

17

its holding such as, perhaps, Mathiason and Beheler, but

18

there are definitely cases, Your Honor, such as Berkemer

19

being the prime example, where the Court said, we're not

20

going to rely on talismanic recitation of the definition

21

of Miranda custody.

22

see whether the concerns implicated -- or the concerns

23

that drove the Miranda court are implicated in a given

context.

before the case a couple of years ago that said the test

2

is that of a reasonable person, that one of California,

3

from California.

4

MS. O'SULLIVAN:

5

QUESTION:

6

MS. O'SULLIVAN:

The Stansbury case, Your Honor.

Yes, that's right.
The Stansbury case, though,

7

made clear, Your Honor, that that case was designed -- in

8

that case the Court felt that it was simply reiterating a

9

rule that it felt that everybody would have known by now,

10

and that its preceding cases had established a reasonable

11

person standard from the beginning, so I believe, Your

12

Honor, that the reasonable person standard certainly was

13

in place at least by the point of Berkemer.

14

Justice Souter, my second response to your

15

suggestion is this, is that when we're looking at the

16

policies that determine whether something should be --

17

whether a mixed question should be allocated, say, to what

18

is primarily denominated as a factfinder or to an

19

appellate court, we can talk about those policies, but I

20

submit that that determination has already been made by

21

Congress and this Court.

22

This Court has made very clear that mixed

23

questions that added, in Townsend's words, the application

24

of law to fact or the determination of the legal

25

significance of the facts as found, is a question that is

For example, in FELA cases the reasonable --

In habeas cases, Your Honor,

7

QUESTION:

I take it you recognize that in some

8

cases reasonableness is for the trier, whether judge or

9

jury, the subject is clearly erroneous, but in other

10

cases, reasonableness requires policing by an appellate

11

forum.

12

MS. O'SULLIVAN:

13

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And the standard by which we can

14

distinguish the one from the other is that in the second

15

category what is the need for special policing?

16

some way we can tell well, we can tolerate a lot of

17

inconsistency, even, with different juries coming out

18

differently on reasonable --

19

MS. O'SULLIVAN:

20

QUESTION:

Is there

Mm-hmm.

-- but why can't we tolerate the same

21

uncertainty about in custody, so one group would find not

22

in custody, another part would find in custody, they're

both reasonable, so appellate court would leave them

context again you're asking the community to decide,

2

looking backward, whether certain conduct should be

3

sanctioned, whether somebody should be made liable for

4

that conduct based on community standards.
We're not asking that those standards be imposed

5
6

Nationwide.

A jury in Illinois -- we're encouraging a

7

jury in Illinois to apply a different standard than a jury

8

in Maine.
By contrast, in this situation, what we have is,

9
10

we have a Federal quasi-constitutional standard.

11

asking courts to not only define what that standard means

12

by applying the standard in the context of each particular

13

case, but we're also asking the appellate court to define

14

a uniform, at least consistent body of law regarding the

15

meaning of that standard.

16

because in this context, just as in the Fourth Amendment

17

context, we're asking law enforcement to conform their

18

conduct to those rules.
QUESTION:

Well, are you suggesting,

Ms. O'Sullivan, that a finder of fact or determiner of

case, courts all over the United States must reach the

9

MS. O'SULLIVAN:

Is it, indeed, a case

I think that's why the Court

adopted an objective standard for custody, Your Honor.
If the Court were inclined to treat this as a
question of fact that could differ with the jurisdiction

10

with the suspect's particular susceptibility or the

11

police's particular conduct, it could have easily have

12

applied this objective test.

13

QUESTION:

No, not the suspect's -- not the

14

peculiar character of the suspect at all, but just what

15

reasonable people in a community might feel about actions

16

concerning an interrogation.

17

might have felt free to leave under these circumstances,

18

and a person in New York might not have.

MS. O'SULLIVAN:

Your Honor, the difficulty with

20

having that kind of disparity would be twofold.

21

all, it would result in a disparity among defendants

depending on whether they were arrested in California or

New York, and the extent of protection afforded to them by

24

Miranda, which should not be countenanced.

QUESTION:

Well, I don't know that that's right,

2

Ms. O'Sullivan, because if the reasonable person tests

says, did I feel -- did a reasonable person feel free to

4

leave, maybe people in New York just react differently

5

than people in Alaska to the same set of circumstances.

QUESTION:

Of course, you might have a New

Yorker arrested in Alaska.

8

(Laughter.)

9

MS. O'SULLIVAN:

10

QUESTION:

And then where would we be.

But I suppose your answer might --

11

would this be a possible answer, that even if in fact

12

13

there are different, geographically differing standards of
«
feelings of freedom to leave, whether the feeling is

14

sufficient enough for Miranda purposes is still a Federal

15

question, so you would still want a Federal court in

16

Alaska or California or Boston or wherever it might be

17

ultimately to pass on the appropriateness of the

18

satisfaction of the Federal standard even if people feel

19

differently about leaving in various parts of the country?

MS. O'SULLIVAN:

QUESTION:

23

That's correct, Your Honor --

If that is correct, then maybe -You were going to add something.

that that's -- that basically yes, we want a uniform rule

the legal standard happened to be competency to stand

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CYNTHIA M. HORA

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MS. HORA:

5
6

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

7

An Alaska State trial judge found the

8

petitioner, Carl Thompson, was not in custody for Miranda

9

purposes when he voluntarily appeared at the Fairbanks

10

trooper station and voluntary answered questions posed by

11

two Alaska State troopers.

12

The Ninth Circuit accorded the State court's

13

determination on the custody issue the presumption of

14

correctness, and concluded that it found fair support in

15

the record.

16

Three sound policy reasons support the Ninth

17

Circuit's decision to accord the presumption of

18

correctness to the Miranda custody determination.

19

the custody determination is extremely fact-bound, so the

20

trial court is in the better position to decide the issue.

21
22

23

QUESTION:

First,

Well, it's always fact-bound, but the

difficulty of resolution is going to vary.
I mean, sometimes, let's say when the only issue

24

was, was the defendant walking in and out of the

25

interrogation room giving press interviews in the

1

meantime, that's a simple question of fact, and if that's

2

what the issue of custody turns on, then you really can

3

say there wasn't any legal issue in this determination, it

4

was just a purely factual one.

5

But then you have cases like this in which it

6

may be very, very close, and at that point it's hard to

7

articulate a set of facts which determines the answer, and

8

at that point there's kind of a point at which the

9

instinctive legal judgment has to be what finally resolves

10
11

the issue.
So that in a case like this, the factual

12

element -- the difficulty of the factual element, in fact,

13

is not great, but the difficulty of the legal element

14

great, so in a case like this, isn't it fair to say, well,

15

this isn't the kind of fact-bound case that we say we

16

don't want to be wasting legal time on or need to waste

17

legal time on?

18

MS. HORA:

This is the type of application of

law to the facts that we don't want to be wasting

MS. HORA:

of policy, the same kind of policy autonomy that we want

6

that, do we?

7

MS. HORA:

No, but I'm not suggesting that the

8

State court's findings are unreviewable at any level.

9

They are still reviewable at the standard level.

Well, the Miranda question, the

jury anyway, is it?

1

the demeanor of the witnesses who testify in front of the

2

trial judge, and it -- and that demeanor and inflection

3

and the tone of voice and the various factual findings,

4

and it's the weight and the reasonable inferences that one

5

draws from that evidence and those facts that really have

6

a very factual nature, and are very dependent on the

7

demeanor and credibility of the witnesses, something that

8

you can't find from a written decision by a trial court.

9

A trial court may he able to articulate

10

particular facts that the trial judge relied upon in

11

making the custody determination, but those decisions

12

often don't reflect exactly how much weight that trial

types of facts.

That is correct.

However, as I

stated before, the fact that this factual issue, or

and subject to the presumption of correctness, the legal

standard, or the legal principles underlying Miranda and

the definition of what Miranda custody is and what factors

Okay, but there's a different problem

that is the problem that arises from the fact that what is

12

consideration that drives the application of Miranda, is

13

difficult to articulate, and it cannot be articulated --

14

it isn't articulated simply by saying, well, it's what a

15

reasonable person would feel.

16

That just passes the buck to whoever is going to

17

determine what the reasonable person does feel, and in

18

those -- in instances like that, where it is very

19

difficult to articulate the standard, ultimately the only

way you can show what it means is by pointing to examples

that you yourself supply and says -- and you say, this is

in which we said, by issues of fact we mean to refer to

That's an opinion by Justice Frankfurter that

It seems to me, counsel, that when

you were suggesting that fundamental constitutional rights

are subject to de novo review in the courts, or some

plenary review, that there was an implicit admission, or

an implicit premise that control by the courts is better

MS. HORA:

That's correct.

2

QUESTION:

So there are some things that trigger

3

de novo review -- voluntariness, ineffective assistance of

counsel -- other things that don't, and you're saying

5

Miranda falls on the side with jury bias and not on the

6

side with voluntariness or ineffective assistance.

7

Why, if the object is that Miranda is not just

8

some words that are spoken sometimes but words that must

9

be spoken at a certain time, doesn't the Federal court

10
11

need to have control over what that time is?
MS. HORA:

The Federal court, though, can do

that by articulating the standard.

police will have?

1

setting out facts and saying, yes, this is custody, no,

2

this isn't, it's not going to be particularly helpful to

3

the trial courts because you know, the myriad of factual

4

situations in the Miranda context is varied, and it's --

5

what weight to give particular facts is going to depend on

6

the particularly facts of the case, which is very

7

dependant on the demeanor and the credibility of the

8

witnesses.

9

For example, in this case, Mr. Thompson was told

10

I think seven or eight times that he was not under arrest.

11

If that fact appears in a decision, how helpful is that

12

going to be to another trial judge in Boston, or Florida,

13

or wherever, in determining whether or not a person, you

14

know, taken into custody in their jurisdiction was

15

under -- or was entitled to Miranda warnings or not, if

16

they were advised two times that they were not under

17

arrest and they were free to leave?

18

I mean, it's very hard to discern principles

19

from just application of the facts.

You can set out the

20

general factors in the test, in the definition, in

21

clarifying and honing the definition, but you don't

22

achieve that uniformity or those clarification of guiding

principles in that in fact-bound de novo review.

this is a fact-bound determination, and you won't achieve
