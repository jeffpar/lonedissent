CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in Number 94-12, Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida.

Mr. Rogow.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE S. ROGOW

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROGOW:

8

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
One hundred and twenty-one Indian tribes in 23

11

States have entered into 137 compacts pursuant to the

12

Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.

13

The act carefully balances the interests of

14

three sovereigns, the States, the United States, and the

15

Indian tribes.

16

opportunity to play a significant role in the scope of

17

Indian gaming within those States.

18

The act provides the States with an

Central to the act is the duty of State

19

officials to negotiate in good faith with the Indian

20

tribes regarding gaming, and central to the act is the

21

ability of the tribes to sue the States in Federal court

22

if the States have not negotiated in good faith.

23

The decision below held that the Seminole Tribe

24

did not have the right to sue the State of Florida and its

25

Governor in Federal court despite Congress' clear promise

that that right existed.
2

The court below found that there was no consent

3

by Florida to this lawsuit, and that under Article I, the

4

Foreign -- I'm sorry, the Indian Commerce Clause, there

5

was no power in Congress to abrogate Eleventh Amendment

6

immunity, and finally, the court found that Ex Parte Young

7

did not work in this case.
Our position is, is that there is the power to

8

9

abrogate under the Indian Commerce Clause, and that if

10

there is not, Ex Parte Young permits Federal rights to be

11

vindicated and the interests of the Supremacy Clause to be

12

protected by the suit against the Governor.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Rogow, as a practical matter,

14

what would the Indian tribes lose by the affirmance of the

15

judgment of the Eleventh Circuit here?

16

still -- they'd get regulations coming from the Secretary,

17

which is what Congress could have given them in the first

18

place.

19

MR. ROGOW:

They would

Under the decision of the Eleventh

20

Circuit, they can go directly to the Secretary if they

21

cannot sue.

22

If a State raises Eleventh Amendment immunity,

23

and if a State will not negotiate in good faith, the court

24

of appeals said they could go directly to the Secretary,

25

and that is true that the Congress could have kept the

1

States out of Indian gaming altogether.

2

If that decision of the Eleventh Circuit is

3

affirmed,

including the remedy the Eleventh Circuit left,

4

then the tribes could go directly to the Secretary of the

5

Interior.
QUESTION:

6

Is it clear that the tribes can go

7

directly to the Secretary?

8

supposed to make his decision based on the negotiating

9

positions of the parties, which precede that step in the

10

As I recall the Secretary is

legislation.
So there being no negotiating position, what

11
12

makes you think that that section of the act subsists when

13

the portion providing for suit against the States falls?

14

MR. ROGOW:

Justice Scalia,

15

one can go directly to the Secretary.

16

court of appeals concluded --

QUESTION:

18

MR. ROGOW:

19

it is not clear that
That's what the

Right.
-- and indeed,

the State has cross-

petitioned in this case complaining about that aspect.

20

QUESTION:

So you don't necessarily -- do you or

21

do you not support the proposition that even if you can't

22

sue the States,

23

the Secretary can promulgate regulations?

24
25

nonetheless the rest of the act stands and

MR. ROGOW:

Given the alternative,

position.

QUESTION:

2

(Laughter.)

3

QUESTION:

I thought you would.

What, may I ask, could be done if a

4

State just refused, flat refused to negotiate?

5

any contempt power against the State, or anything of that

6

kind?

7

MR. ROGOW:

Is there

That is covered in the act, Justice

8

O'Connor, and the tribe could then file the lawsuit that

9

is envisioned under 27(d) against the State for failure to

10

negotiate at all, and then the process would occur just as

11

it would in this case where there was negotiation, but the

12

tribe --

QUESTION:

14

get to the Secretary.

15

is there?

16

MR. ROGOW:

But that's all.

It just means you

There isn't any other consequence,

It means you get to the Secretary

17

ultimately.

18

then the court would say to the State, you have an

19

opportunity now to conclude a compact within 60 days.

20

If the State has failed to negotiate at all,

If the State still refuses to do that, then a

21

mediator would be appointed.

22

would be the tribe's compact, and then that would go to

23

the Secretary.

24
25

QUESTION:

The only compact submitted

So is there even a case or

controversy, do you think?

-

MR. ROGOW:

Yes, there is.

The case or

2

controversy is whether or not the State has acted in good

3

faith, has negotiated in good faith, and that discrete

4

fact is one that needs to be resolved for the rest of the

5

process to work.

6

QUESTION:

Well, we don't have a case or

controversy if two people disagree as to whether the sky

is blue.

says it's blue.

look at this on the flip side.

QUESTION:

Is there a finding now in this very

case to the effect that the State acted in good faith?
MR. ROGOW:

There is, Justice O'Connor, and that

7

is presently being held in abeyance on appeal in the

8

Eleventh Circuit, because if there was no judicial power

9

to act in the first place, then that finding would have to

10

be vacated.

11

QUESTION:

Mr. Rogow --

12

QUESTION:

And that finding is what?

13

MR. ROGOW:

14
15

That finding is that the State of

Florida did negotiate in good faith in this case.
QUESTION:

Well, why -- that leaves the question

16

why Florida is so interested in having the jurisdiction,

17

but that's, I guess, not for you to answer.

18

Let me ask you this.

Could Congress, without a

19

constitutional bar, impose -- give the power to the

20

district court to hold the State in contempt for failure

21

to negotiate in good faith?

22

23
24

MR. ROGOW:

Perhaps, but certainly it didn't do

that here, and -QUESTION:

What doubt is there, if there's

jurisdiction?

MR. ROGOW:

1

Only in terms of federalism and

2

concerns for federalism, and working with the lightest

3

hand, being sensitive to federalism, but ultimately, of

4

course, if Congress said, State, you must do something,

5

and the State fails to do .that, then yes, the contempt

6

power would come into play, but the way this statute is

7

constructed, it is sensitive to federalism.
QUESTION:

8

9

instance, Mr. Rogow?

10

MR. ROGOW:

And who is held in contempt in that

The public official, the State

11

official who perhaps would have assumed the duty, but

12

again, Mr. Chief Justice, that is not this statute, and

13

that is not this case.

14

What we have is this carefully tailored statute

15

that says to the State, who must act through State

16

officials in order to negotiate, negotiate in good faith.

17

If you do not, you will lose the opportunity to

18

participate in the scope of gaming because, and this comes

19

back to Congress' plenary power over Indian commerce,

20

because we could have done this without you, but

21

instead --

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Rogow, when you were laying out

23

the alternatives, it seems to me there's a third one that

24

you didn't get to, and I'm having the difficulty some of

my colleagues did in seeing how you're not better off

Justice Ginsburg, then we are back

to Cabazon, and the States could engage in the gaming that

12

the State already allows without any regulation by the

States.

MR. ROGOW:

That thought has crossed my mind,

Justice Ginsburg.

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. ROGOW:

But we take the statute as Congress

22

has written it, but it is true that if we lose this case,

23

and if the State can preclude the lawsuit, and if the

24

remedy of the Secretary going directly to the Secretary is

25

really not a remedy, then we are back to Cabazon, and we

1

are unregulated in Class III gaming, but we, of course,

2

are subject to Congress' power just as the States are

3

subject to Congress' power.

4

QUESTION:

So you're really defending Congress

5

more than you are the tribe in the position you're

6

presenting, because the tribe, I assume, would rather be

7

free of any regulation, and if it has to be subject to

8

some regulation, it would rather have just one instead of

9

two regulators.

10

MR. ROGOW:

That is absolutely true, Justice

11

Ginsburg and, indeed, the tribes were not happy with the

12

Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, because they preferred the

13

Cabazon decision, which allowed them latitude more than

14

the act does, and so yes, it is true that this argument is

15

in many ways a defense of Congress' power, but if Congress

16

doesn't have that power, yes, the tribes would be

17

unfettered by State regulation.

18

The question is whether or not, under the

19

statute as constructed, Congress can abrogate the State's

20

Eleventh Amendment immunity.

21

plenary power of Congress under the Indian Commerce Clause

22

does give it that power and, indeed, if that power does

23

not exist, then Ex Parte Young works in this case because

24

Ex Parte Young is based upon the duty of State officials

25

to follow a federally enforceable right, and the Federal

Our position is, is that the

Gas case?
MR. ROGOW:

QUESTION:

8

MR. ROGOW:

10
11

We do rely upon Union Gas.

Union

Gas is an Interstate Commerce Clause case --

7

9

Now, do you also rely on that Union

Right.
-- in which the Court held that

under the Interstate Commerce Clause, Congress has the
power to abrogate Eleventh Amendment -QUESTION:

And do you take the position that

12

this could also be decided under the Interstate Commerce

13

Clause and Union Gas?

14

MR. ROGOW:

We do believe that.

We had argued

15

that below, that the Interstate Commerce Clause was

16

another basis for Congress enacting the Indian Gaming Act,

17

but the Indian Commerce Clause, it seems to us, is the

18

stronger basis for this and, indeed, I think the Indian

19

Commerce Clause is even stronger than the Interstate

20

Commerce Clause when one looks at Union Gas in terms of

21

supporting the abrogation power.

22

The Indian Commerce Clause is a change in the

23

relationship between the States and the United States and

24

the Federal Government by giving plenary power to Congress

25

in the area of Indian commerce.

QUESTION:

Well, what do you understand the

Union Gas case to stand for, Mr. Rogow?

3

MR. ROGOW:

That under Article I, Congress has

4

the power under the Interstate Commerce Clause to abrogate

5

State Eleventh Amendment immunity.

6

QUESTION:

And it doesn't stand for anything

7

more than that, does it, because there was no opinion for

the Court?

MR. ROGOW:

It stands for only the proposition

that I haveadvanced

QUESTION:

12

MR. ROGOW:

13

But the Indian Commerce Clause is even more

Yes.
-- yes.

It was a 4-1-4 decision.

14

powerful than the Interstate Commerce Clause.

15

this Court has used forceful and strong language in

16

talking about Congress' power under the Indian Commerce

17

Clause.

QUESTION:

Indeed,

You don't need a negative Indian

Commerce Clause. It's

In the Seminole Nation case at 316 U.S. at page

2

296, the Court talked in these terms:

3

distinctive obligation of trust towards the Indian tribes,

4

moral obligations of the highest responsibility and order,

5

and this language adds great credence to the strength of

6

the Indian Commerce Clause.

7

There's a

that there are no limitations upon Congress' authority

under the Indian Commerce Clause.

that clause is complete.
QUESTION:

No limitations as to their power over

Indians, not over States.

13

there's no limitation of Congress' power over the States.

MR. ROGOW:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. ROGOW:

They don't agree that --

That is true, Justice Stevens.
Yes.
They would like to read it only one

17

way, but the Indian Commerce Clause, when one looks at the

18

history of it, clearly was a taking from the States of any

19

role in Indian commerce in favor of the United States.

20

QUESTION:

Well, but there's a difference

21

between assigning powers and functions between the two

ZZ

branches of Government, in this case ail to the national

Government, and from going the further step of saying that

24

this allows the national Government to order the States to

goal.

I simply know of no precedent for that, unless you

2

can show me one.
MR. ROGOW:

3

All that the States are being

ordered, Justice Kennedy, is a duty -- is to negotiate

5

with the tribes to serve, indeed, the State's own goals,

States disagree with.

They're being asked to invoke their

10

pursuit of a goal that they may not agree with, and I know

11

of no precedent for that.

12

MR. ROGOW:

I can think of no precedent that

13

directly addresses that, but to the extent that your

14

question brings into focus a Tenth Amendment kind of

15

problem, there is no commandeering here.

16

the Tenth Amendment cases, which talk about a duty to

regulate, imposing a duty to regulate, or a duty to

Young, too, because it seems to me that, unlike Young,

2

where you're asking the State to refrain from engaging in

3

a certain action, here you are commanding the State to

4

invoke its formal machinery, and that's not Young, either.
MR. ROGOW:

5

Young is built on the premise that

6

there is a Federal duty, and there are other cases --

7

Morales v. Texas, a Federal Airline Deregulation Act,

8

Green v. Mansour, Edelman, dealing with welfare rights

9

laws, in which the Court has utilized Ex Parte Young to

10

compel a State to follow Federal law.
QUESTION:

11

Well, it's somewhat the difference in

12

mandatory and prohibitory injunctions which is not

13

particularly satisfactory, but here -- in Young, the only

14

Federal duty was not to interfere with a right, and that's

15

quite different from saying that you must participate in

16

this scheme.

17

MR. ROGOW:

Justice Kennedy, here, the Federal

18

duty is to follow the will of Congress, which has plenary

19

power, and -- and this is the ironic part of this case --

20

participate in the scheme.

21

statute is sensitive to the interests of federalism.

22

is different from Ex Parte Young, but not different enough

23

to make a difference in the outcome.

GENERAL DAYS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

This Court has, in a number of decisions,
recognized that the Ex Parte Young doctrine strikes an

10

uneasy balance between the interest in respecting State

11

sovereignty on the one hand while on the other vindicating

12

federally afforded rights.

We think that the Ex Parte Young doctrine can be

15

used effectively by this Court to support what Congress

16

has done in attempting to address a very difficult

17

question over Class III gaming on Indian lands.

18

What we have here is a federally imposed duty,

19

and let me underscore the fact that the federally imposed

20

duty upon the State is to negotiate in good faith.

we do have an interest in preventing gaming that is not

already permitted in the State.
However, we had that authority even without the

Indian Gaming Regulatory Act,, as I mentioned before.

QUESTION:

Don't you think you have it under the

the statute merely authorizes Indian gaming that the State

also authorizes?

11

not?

Doesn't the -- isn't it your view that

That's your view of the statute, is it

MR. GLOGAU:

12

That is correct.

That's the view

13

of the Ninth Circuit in the Rumsey case which was recently

14

decided, but the point is that although Congress has the

15

authority to regulate Indian gambling under its complete

16

authority under the Indian Commerce Clause, they still

17

must do it in a way that is constitutional and is

18

permissible, and our position is that there are a myriad

19

of ways that could have been done properly that were

20

suggested in the Court's opinion in New York v. United

21

States.

22

There are a myriad of ways that the Congress can

That's why we're here.

Your position is that being required

to negotiate is itself a harm to the State, regardless of

5

whether, down at the end of the road, if you fail to do

6

that there are other harmful consequences.

7

of itself, is a harm.

8

MR. GLOGAU:

9

That's correct.

That, in and

That's a violation

of the Tenth Amendment, which reserves to the States their

10

sovereign authorities, and --

11

QUESTION:

Not the least of those harms being

12

that if a gambling establishment is instituted, it ought

13

to be very clear that it was done by the Federal

14

Government without the participation of the States if the

15

States object.

16

MR. GLOGAU:

That's correct.

The Federal

17

Government, the Congress in this situation, has avoided

18

the political responsibility of taking charge of gambling

19

on an Indian reservation and foisted it upon the State

20

officials, and that's a clear Tenth Amendment violation,

21

as the Court wrote in New York v. United States.

22

QUESTION:

MR. GLOGAU:

If the remedy is to order the State

to conclude a contract with the employees --

QUESTION:

And they couldn't turn it over to the

7

Labor Board and say you will, in fact, find an unfair

labor practice and issue an order, require bargaining in

good faith.
MR. GLOGAU:

10
11

I think that would violate the

Tenth Amendment.
QUESTION:

12

Okay.

My other question which I

13

wanted to ask was -- you started off on this, and I'd

14

appreciate you getting back to it, which was this problem

15

of Ex Parte Young.

16

To focus it a little bit, I thought that maybe

17

Ex Parte Young does make the Eleventh Amendment mostly a

18

formal requirement.

19

They're all suits against the State in reality, aren't

20

they?

21

that's the area where the Treasury is involved.

22

It says, you can go sue the officer.

But it reserves one area where you can't, and

So to look at it naively, you'd say yes, Ex

23

Parte Young says sue the officer, not the State.

24

all suits against the State in reality.

25

1

But that's what it says, it's there,

2

and so I could understand a reading of it which says,

sure, go sue the officer except where the Treasury is

4

involved, because that's too much the State.
Now, if I -- what's -- I'm putting this so that

you can tell me why that's wrong and argue against it --

MR. GLOGAU:

QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor --- which is where you wanted to go, I

think.

MR. GLOGAU:

MR. GLOGAU:

Yes.

Thank you.

With regard to Ex Parte Young,

14

State does not turn solely on the question of whether

15

we're seeking damages or prospective relief.

disavowed by this Court in two cases, Cory v. White and

QUESTION:

But I mean, they left a little

21

curlicue on that, but -- which I don't think is relevant

here, or maybe it is, but why shouldn't you view it

where a suit against a State official is an attempt to

invoke the sovereignty of the State and to order the State

3

to invoke its sovereign machinery the way that Justice

Kennedy suggested.

QUESTION:

They're all that.

Isn't Ex Parte

Young all that?

7

Follow the Federal Constitution, follow a Federal statute,

do that which Federal law tells the State to do.

10

It's telling a State officer, you go in

MR. GLOGAU:

Well, I don't see it that way,

11

because what Ex Parte -- injunctions under Ex Parte Young

12

tell the State official not to do that which he is not

13

permitted to do, and I think there's a difference there.

14

And the other thing is that in the balance that

15

is that makes Ex Parte Young necessary, and Mr. Rogow

16

referred to it, that balance between the State sovereign

17

immunity and the vindication of Federal constitutional

18

balance tips in favor of allowing the State official to

have his immunity stripped and allowing an injunction to

In Young and all of its progeny, from what my

2

research shows, all of those cases involve violations of

the Constitution, and so the balance in those cases tips

toward stripping the immunity.
Without the constitutional violation, the

In this case -QUESTION:

I thought Young applied to violations

of statutes and regulations as well as the Constitution?
MR. GLOGAU:

11

Your Honor, the language in some of

the cases says constitutional or Federal law.

13

when you look at the facts of each one of those cases,

14

each one of them involves a violation of the Constitution.

Yes, that is true, as long as we

an unconstitutional remedy that the Court -- that Congress

has created, which as, you know, Justice Scalia indicated,

Is there any way that Congress can

MR. GLOGAU:

Well, they could give the option to

the State to be involved in Indian gambling, and

specifically -- specifically require, as in the Parden

QUESTION:

Could Congress also provide that

there shall be no gambling unless the State of its own

Yes.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE S. ROGOW

14

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

15

MR. ROGOW:

Justice Stevens, I'm in a strange

16

position here, and it must be one of the first times in

17

history that a lawyer for Indian tribes is arguing to give

18

the States a chance to be heard, and yet that's what this

19

statute does, but I argue for it because we think it is

20

right constitutionally.

21

I'm not here to defend Congress' power.

I'm

22

here to defend the tribal sovereignty, and Congress has

23

seen fit -- it has exclusive plenary authority over the

24

tribes, and it does over the States -- has seen fit to

25

craft this delicately balanced statute.

MR. ROGOW:

Because there must be a remedy, and

the remedy is that the rest of the process which Congress

had the power to create would then be triggered.

This was

One question was asked during the argument, is

9

what is to be gained by the States, and what is to be

10

gained by the States is something that they would not

11

otherwise have had, an opportunity to participate in the

12

scope of gaming.

13

Is that better --

QUESTION:

Well, they might well gain in this

14

case if we found against them, but they're looking down

15

the road, and the principles that this case would

16

establish as to what the Federal Government can order the

17

States to do, and as to when the Federal Government can

18

permit the States to be sued, are important issues.

19

They're looking beyond Indian gaming laws.

20

MR. ROGOW:

They are, Justice Scalia, but the

21

precedent is already there for this kind of order from a

22

Federal court.

It is not intrusive.

QUESTION:

5

Morales discuss in any detail the Ex Parte Young aspect of

that case?

MR. ROGOW:

It used and cited Ex Parte Young as

think, to enjoin them from enforcing laws that would have

violated Federal laws, and so -QUESTION:
