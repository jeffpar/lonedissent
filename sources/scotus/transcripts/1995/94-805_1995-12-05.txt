ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAVIER AGUILAR

8

ON BEHALF OF THE STATE APPELLANTS
MR. AGUILAR:

10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
At issue in this direct appeal is the

11
12

constitutionality of three congressional districts that

13

the court below erroneously ruled were racially

14

gerrymandered.

15

These districts are localized in two

16

metropolitan areas of the State of Texas, two counties,

17

Harris County and Dallas County.

18

are Congressional Districts 18, which is a black

1

opportunity district that was created originally in the

20

1 70's in Harris County, Congressional District 2 , which

21

is a brand new congressional district, which is now a

22

Hispanic opportunity district in Harris County, and

23

Congressional District 30, which is a black opportunity

24

district in Dallas County, a brand new black opportunity

25

district.

The districts involved

district?

Mr. Aguilar, what is this opportunity-

This is new terminology.
MR. AGUILAR:

Well, it's a majority minority

district that was created under --

5

QUESTION:

Why don't we just call them majority

6

minority districts?

7

whatever terminology -- you can call them, you know,

8

motherhood apple pie districts if you like, but you will

9

be insulting my intelligence every time you say it.

I mean, you're entitled to use

Can't

10

we give it some, you know, unemotive terminology that we

11

can use in the argument?

12

MR. AGUILAR:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. AGUILAR:

15

Yes, Your Honor.

Thank you.
I'll refer to them as majority

minority districts.

16

The district court we believe legally erred in

17

its finding below that the three districts were racially

18

gerrymandered for two reasons.

19

predominated in the drawing of the districts, but it did

20

so because it refused to recognize the State's customary

21

and traditional redistricting principle of incumbency

22

protection, as well as other principles that it utilized,

23

including the equal population rule that it always follows

24

and it must follow --

25

QUESTION:

First, it held that race

That's pretty much a question of

1

fact, isn't it, Mr. Aguilar, whether it was basically a

2

desire to preserve incumbency or whether it was the desire

3

to create majority minority districts?

4

MR. AGUILAR:

Well, yes, sir, it is a question

5

of fact, Your Honor, but in this case -- they decided this

6

case before Miller v. Johnson, and I think their opinion

7

is clear that they did not believe that incumbency

8

protection should be considered a traditional districting

9

principle because it was not among those listed in the

10

Shaw v. Reno case to begin with.
It is our contention that the determination of

11
12

what is a customary and traditional districting principle

13

is something that is determined by the State and its

14

practices, its historical practices, and there was no

15

doubt that in this case there's plenty of evidence to show

16

that Texas has followed the traditional practice of

17

incumbency protection to decide where it's going to draw

18

its districts, and incumbency protection as applied by the

19

Texas legislature, certainly in the 1990's, really has

20

four aspects, Mr. Chief Justice.
First, it is not pairing incumbents.

21

It will

22

not vote for a plan that does not pair incumbents, simply

23

because they want to preserve the State's congressional

24

seniority.

25

Second, it means that if you're going to have to

redraw districts, which they had to because of the fact

2

that the population had increased so greatly in Texas that

3

we had been reapportioned three different districts, that

4

you try to maintain the constituency of each of the

5

Congresspeople.

6

QUESTION:

Okay, but Mr. Aguilar, you made this

7

argument, I take it, to the district court, and you can

8

see it's a question of fact as to what the motivation for

9

drawing -- and the district court rejected those findings.

10
11

Are you contending here that they're clearly erroneous?
MR. AGUILAR:

No, Your Honor.

We're saying that

12

their decision is legally wrong because it did not

13

properly apply the rule of Miller v. Johnson.

14

fact, quite frankly they didn't have it to apply because

15

it wasn't decided until sometime after the opinion.

Now, in

16

What we're saying is, they recognized --

17

QUESTION:

Well, but Mr. Aguilar, the district

18

court did make findings that the districts were formed in

19

utter disregard for traditional redistricting criteria,

20

and were unexplainable on other than racial grounds.

21
22

23

Now, are those findings --do you say either of
those are clearly erroneous?
MR. AGUILAR:

Those findings are tainted, Your

24

Honor, by the legal error in not recognizing that the

25

State of Texas has a long tradition of protecting

that is -QUESTION:

You're just saying it's a traditional

State interest that is followed in Texas --

8

MR. AGUILAR:

9

QUESTION:

10

No, Your Honor.

It is something --

-- in drawing districts.

MR. AGUILAR:

That is correct, Justice O'Connor.

11

What we're saying is, you -- if you're going to try to

12

determine whether there has been a racial motivation, you

13

look at all the different objectives --

14

QUESTION:

Well --

15

MR. AGUILAR:

16

QUESTION:

-- that the State utilized.

-- all right, but you did present

17

evidence to the district court of protection of

18

incumbency.

19

the district court, and it nevertheless found that that

20

may well be so, but it was overshadowed here by the

21

decision in drawing the district boundaries to totally

22

draw them along racial lines.

23

I mean, that evidence was apparently before

MR. AGUILAR:

Yes, Your Honor, and if I may,

24

they certainly considered that, and they even acknowledged

25

in their opinion that incumbency protection was a major

1

objective in the State, all over the State.

2

QUESTION:

Right.

3

MR. AGUILAR:

And they didn't particularly like

4

it, and they said as much, but despite the fact that 24

5

out of the 30 districts, Justice O'Connor, were challenged

6

on these grounds, only these three districts were found to

7

be racially gerrymandered, and I'd like to point to the

8

Court -- refer to the Court to Joint Appendix at page 192.

9

I'd like to use that as an example, trying to flesh out

10

what I'm trying to say.
QUESTION:

11

Mr. Aguilar, before you do that,

12

remind me -- I think you mentioned it just a moment ago.

13

Didn't this Court not credit incumbency on the same line

14

as the traditional factors that were mentioned in the Shaw

15

opinion?

16

decided, and I -- can you be precise about how this Court

17

treated incumbency?

18

districting factor?

19
20

As you pointed out, Miller had not yet been

Did it consider it a traditional

MR. AGUILAR:

Are you asking in the Shaw

opinion, Your Honor?

21

QUESTION:

No, in this opinion.

22

MR. AGUILAR:

I think it recognized that it was

23

a motivation of the legislature all over the State.

24

think it certainly recognized and accepted that.

25

that in the process of accepting that --

QUESTION:

1

Did it treat it as something that

2

could dominate?

My question is, did the Court recognize

3

that incumbency should be treated as a legitimate factor?
MR. AGUILAR:

4

No, Your Honor.

They believed

5

that incumbency protection was not something that this

6

Court referred to in the Shaw decision and, consequently,

7

since it didn't fall within the -- those factors that this

8

Court referenced in Shaw, therefore it wasn't something

9

that they could pay attention to, and I think -QUESTION:

10

Let me -- may I ask you to go one

11

step further?

I take it, of course, because they were

12

deciding before Miller came down, I take it that what the

13

court was doing was saying that predominant racial motive

14

is an alternative to incumbency protection as a factor,

15

whereas your argument is after -- I think, after Miller,

16

we judge what is a predominant racial motive by asking,

17

among other things, whether it was done in disregard of

18

traditional districting practices, and your final step is,

19

incumbency protection is one of the objects of traditional

20

districting practices.
So that I think what you're saying is the court

21

22

made an either-or choice when there wasn't an either-or

23

choice.

24

other are not really opposing alternatives.

25

have considered incumbency protection in deciding whether

1

the motive was predominantly racial.

2

MR. AGUILAR:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. AGUILAR:

5
6

That is --

Is that fair?
That is exactly correct, Justice

Souter.
QUESTION:

Counsel, I want you to get to

7

section -- to page 192, but let me ask you one question

8

before you do that.

9

If incumbency protection is the motive, but the

10

means used to effect it is racial gerrymandering, is that

11

constitutional?

12

Does that comply with Miller?

MR. AGUILAR:

Well, no, Your Honor.

We are

13

saying that you can -- the legislature can apply its

14

traditional motivation of incumbency protection, and just

15

because it's applying it in an area where there are blacks

16

or Hispanics living, that doesn't necessarily mean that

17

the end result is a racial gerrymander.

18

QUESTION:

Well, suppose I say I want to protect

19

incumbents and, incidentally, I take it this means any

20

incumbent who is an officeholder can protect his or her

21

interests by running for some other office.

22

Senator can be a Congressman, and that's incumbency

23

protection in Texas.

Let's assume that that is the goal, and we say,

gerrymanders.

2

Court's holding in Miller?

3

Does this -- is this consistent with the

MR. AGUILAR:

Well, if the predominant

4

motivation is just collecting as many minorities that you

5

can within one district, and you don't care whether it

6

protects your incumbents, you don't care about --

7

QUESTION:

No, no, that's not my hypothetical.

8

My hypothetical is, we want to protect incumbents, and the

9

way we're going to do this, the principal way, the

10

principal mechanism we're going to use is assigning voters

11

to districts on account -- by race.

12

with the command of Miller?

13

MR. AGUILAR:

Does that comport

I think it would, Your Honor.

15

that we cannot consider race, but in our case, Your

QUESTION:

We're not saying

Well, that's one of the things we're

going to ask.
MR. AGUILAR:

Well, in our - for instance, if we

20

had a case where there was no reason to create this

21

district -- in other words, there was very little reason

22

to create a majority minority district under the Voting

23

Rights Act, then I would say we would be running afoul of

24

this Court's ruling in Miller, but when you have a

25

situation where -12

QUESTION:

1

Well now, Mr. Aguilar, was there

2

evidence here that majority minority districts could have

3

been drawn in 18, 29, and 30 that would have been more

4

compact, and that would not have presented this racial

of the incumbents?

know, house to house to pick up certain particular voters

MR. AGUILAR:

Well,

they weren't drawn house to

house, Your Honor, but yes,

in fact,

in these three areas that were geographically more

compact.

Well, that's right. We could draw

other alternative districts, there was no question about
that.

QUESTION:

MR. AGUILAR:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. AGUILAR:

No, Your Honor.

No.
Our position --

I would have thought it might.
Well, our position on narrow

18

tailoring is that once there is a reason to draw the

19

districts under the Voting Rights Act, the narrow

20

tailoring means you just draw the district that's

21

necessary that affords that group an opportunity to elect

22

someone of their choosing.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. AGUILAR:

25

You mean, the number of districts?
The number of districts, that's

correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

1

What would be an example of broad

2

tailoring, then, once you find that the -- you want to

3

draw those kinds of -- are there any kind of boundary

4

lines you can't have?
MR. AGUILAR:

5

Well, I think that -- I guess the

6

best example would be in the Miller case.

The boundaries

7

there were much -- we're talking about a totally different

8

district that spanned some 200, 250 miles, that linked

9

together different cities, different disparate black

10

populations that had very little in common with them,

11

where the district boundaries themselves, the black

12

population was located in the outer ridges of the

13

district.

14

narrow --

15

That's not what we have here.

QUESTION:

We believe

So you do recognize that narrow

16

tailoring would outlaw some kinds of districts drawn after

17

a decision to draw majority minority -- but you say this

18

is narrowly tailored in your case.

19

MR. AGUILAR:

It's narrowly tailored because we

20

first of all realized that there was a sufficiently large

21

minority population in a geographically compact area, and

22

there was racially polarized voting.

23

Having made that determination, we then drew a

24

district in that location.

25

suggestion of Justice O'Connor that there were different

Now, I agree with the

alternatives.

We could have drawn all kinds of different

2

boundaries, but it was -- you know, politics is a contact

3

sport --

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. AGUILAR:

6

7

Do you --- and people don't want to --

sorry, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

If, in fact -- suppose for the sake

8

of argument that it was accepted that under Miller you

9

could use race as a basis for creating a

10

section 2-required district of the Voting Rights Act, a

11

reasonably compact one.

12

insofar as a district departs from a compact shape, that's

13

okay if the motive for the departure from the compact

14

shape has nothing to do with race, such as protecting

15

incumbents.

16

Suppose you also thought that

If you thought both of those things, then would

17

you have to remand this case in order to decide if the

18

reason that these districts depart from the compact shape

19

is incumbency protection?

20

MR. AGUILAR:

No, Your Honor.

I think the

21

evidence is sufficient here to be able to reverse, Your

22

Honor, and render.

23

I think that --

I think that the error is one of law.

misunderstood your answer, but I thought you said that

they could have satisfied the minority majority district

composition with a more compact -- that they could have

satisfied both incumbency and race.

MR. AGUILAR:

Perhaps you didn't

I did not complete my answer.

The

7

reason why they didn't, they would not have, the

8

legislature I'm talking about, would not have accepted the

9

proposed plans that the plaintiffs proposed and even the

10

State plans -- the districts that we drew for litigation

11

purposes show that we could, in fact, draw more

geographically compact districts -- was because they would

pair incumbents.

It's because we would lose some of our

QUESTION:

Mr. Aguilar, let me understand what

MR. BENDER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Even if strict scrutiny is applicable to the

districts in this case, the district court decision

12

invalidating those districts was legally incorrect and it

13

must be reversed.

14

The district court held that although Texas

15

might have a compelling interest in creating majority

16

minority, or minority opportunity districts in Dallas and

17

Houston in order to protect the rights of minorities in

18

those communities, who are the victims of polarized

19

voting, to protect their right to participate in the

20

process in a fair way, that even if Texas had those

21

compelling interests, the districts that Texas actually

22

created were not narrowly tailored.

The court held that because it found that Texas

departing from compactness, the court flunked the narrow

2

tailoring test.
QUESTION:

3

Do you agree with Mr. Aguilar that

4

that is basically a confusion of categories, that narrow

5

tailoring goes basically to number of districts, and the

6

niceness of the lines with which they are drawn is

7

essentially the question, or is essentially an issue that

8

you look at when you're deciding whether, in fact, the

9

motive was predominantly racial as distinct from a motive

10

consistent with customary districting practices?
MR. BENDER:

11
12

I think the niceness of the lines

is relevant probably to both aspects of it.

One of the

3

ways that you can depart from narrow tailoring would be to

4

draw racial lines gratuitously.
QUESTION:

5

Well, I suppose if you -- there's a

6

point at which the line is crossed between protecting an

7

incumbent who draws votes predominantly from one race, on

8

the one hand, and packing on the other hand, but that is

9

an inquiry, I take it, that you would make at the point

20

where you're saying, what is the predominant motive here

21

in order to determine whether strict scrutiny applies at

22

all?

23

Or does the State have to follow the

MR. BENDER:

That's not a constitutional

requirement, Justice O'Connor.

repeated for the Court in Miller and Johnson, that that's

satisfied if there's a compelling interest.

And in Houston the situation was a little more

complicated.

there, but there was also the fact that the State had a

California case, DeWitt.

14

Instead, what happened is that that minority

community of interest, like all other communities of

interest across the State, saw its district become

17

irregular not because of race -- there was a nice district

there that would have satisfied the Voting Rights Act --

but because of protection of incumbents.

Your Honor, on page 65a of the

QUESTION:

Okay.

MS. HAIR:

The court said that incumbency

5

protection is part of the racial gerrymander, and the

6

court did that because it confused the fact that some

7

African Americans were taken out of the area that normally

8

would have been the most compact version of District 30 in

9

Dallas, for example, but a lot more whites were taken out,

10

and that was error.

not have all these strange appendices, they had precisely

QUESTION:

10

So what is at issue is not the number

of minority majority districts, but their shape.
MS. HAIR:

11

But how they look, and I want to make

12

the point that that is very important, because my clients

13

who live in these districts need to be able to bargain and

14

compromise in the political process just like all other

15

communities of interest across the State, and to single

16

out minority opportunity districts and say that they have

17

to have a special Federal rule of compactness that does

not apply to majority white districts or any other

process.

Well, do you suppose the same rule

applies in reverse, that it would not be constitutional

for the legislature to protect a white incumbent in a

that where you have the Voting Rights Act, the Voting

MR. TROY:

the Court:
With regard to the point that was just being
made, at page 19 of our brief we cite to what the district
court says.
What the district court found exactly was that
Texas, quote, repeatedly segregated African American,
Hispanic, and Anglo populations by race 1) to further the
prospects of incumbent officeholders -- I'm adding the
one -- or 2) to create majority minority congressional
districts.

overwhelmingly supports the district court's finding that

race was the predominant factor in the drawing of these

bizarre, single race majority districts.

point of view, the interest being to elect a minority

than incumbency protection?
MR. TROY:

What human

Your Honor, what the district court

14

found was that they pursued a maximization policy

basically constructing these majority minority single --

their own sake, and then race was used as a tool for

MR. TROY:

First of all, Your Honor --

Unless, of course, you think a lot of

and not worry about race.

14

MR. TROY:

First of all, in Harris County what

15

they did was, they were separating the races, Hispanics

16

and blacks, because the communities were demanding their

17

own districts for their own sake.

18

But with respect to Dallas County what the

19

record shows, Your Honor, is that the architect of the

20

district, Eddie Bernice Johnson, went -- tried to create a

21

performing single race majority black district, and the

reason why -- one of the main reasons why it was not

why it was not compact was she testified in the Terrazas

South Dallas area, and she testified because they tend to

2

be more transient, they tend to not turn out as well, and

3

so then, in order to preserve the single raceness of the

district she went north into Colin County, west into

Tarrant County, hither and yon in order to gather as many

blacks as possible in order to preserve that as a single

race majority district.

That was the overall goal.

In your view, if it were proved --

I'm not saying this is this case, but if it were proved

beyond any doubt that the only reason that the districts

were not compact in shape was to protect incumbents, and

that that had nothing to do with race, under those

QUESTION:

MR. TROY:

I think, Your Honor, that that is, in

7

compactness, contiguity, traditional political

subdivisions, you are -- race is not the predominant

that district was created.

It may be an important motivation, but it is

one of a number of motivations.
QUESTION:

14

Why isn't it the predominant

The motivation is to create a majority

MR. TROY:

That means race.
If you're creating a compact majority

minority district, then you are necessarily taking into

account other factors, i.e., compactness, contiguity,

traditional subdivisions, and the fact that you've got a

2

MR. TROY:

I think the record does show that,

3

Your Honor.

The record clearly shows that race was used

4

as a tool for protecting incumbents, and Miller explicitly

5

rejects use of race as a proxy.

9

essential part of incumbency protection, it was the tool

I thought that's exactly

for incumbency protection.

11

MR. TROY:

I agree with that, Your Honor.

12

QUESTION:

Now, the State didn't have to do

13

that.

14

could have majority minority figures for Democratic voters

15

that would enable a black to be elected and an Hispanic to

16

be elected in the two adjacent districts.

17

It could have drawn districts in your view that

MR. TROY:

That's exactly right, Your Honor.

18

You can't use race for mere administrative convenience.

19

Simply because it's easier to use race to determine who's

20

a Democrat does not justify the use of race.

QUESTION:

Didn't it say on the -- there must

it was only known to the congressional incumbents and to

8

would be constitutional.

9

In your view, if, after doing that, they created

10

an odd shape, and the oddness of that shape had nothing to

11

do with race, it was pure -- that would be constitutional,

but you think that's not what happened here.

that this judgment stands, and they have the same

objective, and for the sake of incumbency protection this

time they use whatever data they've got, let's say

10

precinct level data, so that the lines are not going to be

11

quite so fine but you still get a funny-looking shape for

12

purposes of incumbency protection, and your incumbency

13

protection data is entirely political Democratic data or

Republican data as opposed to race, and it ends up looking

15

something like this, there will still be a factual

black, and most blacks seem to be Democrats, but you would

not find that a violation of the Shaw rule.

MR. TROY:

If the State accomplished its

21

asserted goal of partisan gerrymandering through the use

22

of nonracial data, then that is permissible, but -- but,

23

here they used racial data to accomplish that goal, and

It is suspect to use race as a tool or religion as a tool

But it turns upon, Your Honor, how you interpret

QUESTION:

If that is -- if those three facts

are what we know, is it fair to say under the Miller

definition of what is a subordination of districting to

20

race, that we would not have an apparent case of

21

subordinated districting to race?

22

under the Miller definition, and it would not trigger

23

strict scrutiny.

That would be okay

Is that correct?

both ways.

If you want to say, we are going to draw

2

remedial districts to comply with the Voting Rights Act,

3

then you're almost by definition, I believe, going to be

4

in strict scrutiny, because you are using race for a

5

remedial purpose.

Then the question --

QUESTION:

6

Then what happens if -- let's

7

assume -- all right, if I take that example, then it seems

8

to me I am varying Miller, because Miller didn't say that

9

any use of race, whether for compliance of section 2 or

10

any other, is wrong.
Miller says it's only wrong when it is

11
12

subordinated to traditional districting practices.

13

puts a limitation on it, and it seems to me that your

14

answers to us do not recognize that limitation, so that if

15

we were to agree with you, the Court would have to expand

16

Miller.

17

MR. TROY:

Miller

I think, Your Honor, that if you set

18

out to create a racial goal, and your goal is to comply

19

with the Voting Rights Act, and that is a remedial

20

statute, and your purpose in complying with it is

21

remedial, then it seems to me that your overwhelming

22

purpose, because we're talking about the use of race here,

23

must be remedial, and that --

I suppose one could say that if you start

out with objection number 1 to create a majority minority
district, that is your primary goal.

Everything else,

even though you follow other criteria, could be regarded
as subordinated to that.
MR. TROY:

That --

QUESTION:

So that's your starting point.

MR. TROY:

I think that's right, that is your

starting point
QUESTION:

All right, but that's not what Miller

says, is it?
Miller says that it's predominant if it
subordinates traditional districting practices to race,
and I think what you're saying is, whenever you start out
with the motive of creating a majority minority district,
you in fact trigger strict scrutiny, and by definition you
have always -- you have subordinated every other
consideration to race.

Is that your answer?

MR. TROY:

MR. TROY:

Right.

QUESTION:

Miller says, in deciding whether it

is predominant or not, you look to whether it has excluded

the application of traditional districting principles.

5

it hasn't excluded it, then either it isn't predominant,

or you've got a pretty tough row to hoe to show that it

is, and you're saying, never mind whether the result is

MR. TROY:

They were all Texas judges.

QUESTION:

The thing I wonder about the

6

if these were compact maybe you apply strict scrutiny,

that section 2 perhaps we'd agree would justify it.

9

If they depart from the compactness solely for
nonracial reasons, I think we agree, but I'm not certain,

10

that solely for nonracial reasons it would be okay, and

11

then the question is, what did they do here, and what he

says is, in order to protect incumbents other African

American voters were deliberately fenced out.

14

But what it doesn't say is whether those African

15

American voters were fenced out because they were African

Americans or because there was an inference about their

voting behavior in respect to one incumbent or another --

-- and wouldn't that be key as to why

they were fenced out, just as you've said you might have

reason is that they're likely to vote Democrat, and isn't

Your Honor, in this case the African

that Jews will vote Democratic.

I didn't understand you to say that you could

In fact, I did not say that.

MR. TROY:

I said that neither

in the councilman's mind at the time and he's making that

inference, all this would become unconstitutional, thrown

into the Federal courts, et cetera.

\

5

MR. TROY:

The reason why I don't think that's

6

going to happen, Your Honor, is because of compactness,

7

contiguity, respect for political subdivision.

8

What I understand what happens in city councils

9

throughout the country is they take a look at particular

10

neighborhoods, particular areas of interest, where people

11

have things in common like the schools they go to, the

12

places they shop, the water supply, the potholes in the

13

streets.

14

What they did in this case was, they abandoned

15

that and they said we are going to, particularly in Harris

16

County, we're going to separate the races.

17

take someone who lived in the northwest corner of the city

18

and who's always voted in District 18, who's Hispanic,

19

we're going to take A1 Vera and we're going to lump him

20

with the Hispanics in the southwest -- in the southeastern

21

part of the city because he is Hispanic.

to not respect traditional principles and to be

affirmatively unconstitutional.

Texas told the Department of Justice, that "the Dallas

percent."

This is what

we've been entertaining hypotheticals we've gotten far

10

away from what happened in this case, and what happened in

this case was that race was used as a tool for incumbency

protection only secondarily.
Primarily, there was this maximization policy of

the Department of Justice that everybody knew about.

was, if it could be drawn it must be drawn, and all other
