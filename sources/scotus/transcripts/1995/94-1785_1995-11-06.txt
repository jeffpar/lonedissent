ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

We'll hear argument

MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The tax court is an Article I court of limited

12

jurisdiction.

13

jurisdiction of the tax court to award refunds.

14

This case concerns the limitations on the

When a taxpayer commences a suit in tax court to

15

review an asserted deficiency, the court may then also

16

determine whether an overpayment was made.

17

6512(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, however, provides

18

three detailed jurisdictional limits on the amount of the

19

refund that the court may award.

20

Section

Under section 6512(b)(3)(A), the court may award

21

amounts paid after the notice of deficiency is issued.

22

Under 6512(b)(3)(C), the court may award amounts for which

23

a claim for refund was made before the notice of

24

deficiency was issued, but when, as in this case, there

25

was neither subsequent payment nor a prior refund claim,

section 6512(b)(3)(B), which this case concerns, limits

2

the jurisdiction of the tax court to award amounts that

3

would be refundable under 6511(b)(2) if on the date the

4

notice of deficiency was issued a claim for refund had

5

been filed.

6

In turn, 6511(b)(2) allows a refund of amounts

7

paid within 3 years prior to the claim for refund only if

8

the claim for refund was made within 3 years from the time

9

of the taxpayer's return, but when --

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, in subsection (B) that

11

you're referring to it says that no credit or refund will

12

be allowed unless it was paid within the period which

13

would be applicable under 6511(b)(2)(C), or if on the date

14

of the mailing of the notice of deficiency a claim had

15

been filed, whether or not filed.

16

Now, that language is just incomprehensible.

17

What does that parenthetical mean?

18

isn't filed we can deem it to have been filed?

19

MR. JONES:

Does it mean if it

That's -- what it means is that,

20

whether or not a claim for refund had actually been filed,

21

the court is to apply these statutes as if a claim for

22

refund was filed on that date.

23

doubted, I think, that that is the meaning of that

24

provision.

25

QUESTION:

That was --no one has

And is that what should be done in

this case?
MR. JONES:

Yes.

In this case, because the

taxpayer had failed to file a return before the date of
the notice of deficiency, 6512(b)(3)(B) operates, and what
it operates to do is to require the court to apply
6511(b)(2) as if a claim for refund was filed on the date
the notice of deficiency was issued.
QUESTION:

Why does it say, whether or not,

since subsection (C) covers the case in which it had been
filed before that?
MR. JONES:

Yes, it -- subsection (C) applies if

a claim had been filed before that date.

Subsection (B)

says you are to assume a claim is filed on that date,
whether or not one had been filed.
QUESTION:

Why didn't it just say that it

wasn't, or if it wasn't?
MR. JONES:

I think one of the reasons it might

put it that way is because if you read the rest of
subsection (B) it goes on to say, a claim based upon
whatever grounds the tax court determined an overpayment
was made.
Now, what that refers to is a basic distinction
between district court and tax court jurisdiction.
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:

Oh, I see.
The district court only has

jurisdiction to consider a judicial claim that is based

upon precisely the administrative claim.

material variance between the district court claim and the

administrative claim, the district court has no

jurisdiction, but in the tax court there is no requirement

QUESTION:

If there's any

The court may award a refund

Well, in that respect the taxpayer is

better off to be in the tax court.
MR. JONES:

It -- the taxpayer has a broader

12

refund argument in the tax courts.

13

argument he can come up with, but the price that is paid

14

is that the amount of refund that can be awarded is

15

subject to the very specific and detailed jurisdiction

16

provisions --

17

QUESTION:

He has whatever

Mr. Jones, can I ask you a question

18

about (B), the same -- the one that is at issue here?

19

It's as if a refund claim had been filed.

20

Now, if on that date -- I guess it was

21

September 26, 1990 -- before receiving the notice of

22

deficiency the taxpayer had decided that he ought to file

23

a refund claim because he realized that they had

24

overwithheld, what document would he have then filed?

25

Would it not have been a return?

MR. JONES:

QUESTION:

3

MR. JONES:

4

QUESTION:

He could have filed a return, but -What else?

Is there any --

Yes.
-- other form that the IRS uses that

5

would have enabled him to claim a refund without filing a

6

return?

7
8

MR. JONES:

I think the right answer to your

question is that courts have routinely held that refund
claims can be submitted informally, that they don't have

10

to be on a return --

11

QUESTION:

But is there any Internal Revenue

12

form that provides for seeking a refund without filing a

13

return?

14

MR. JONES:

There are -- there isn't an Internal

15

Revenue form that, of course, is exactly what you've

16

described, a return that includes a claim for refund.

17

There's also --

18

QUESTION:

But is there an Internal Revenue form

1

that seeks a refund without filing a return?

20

think there is, but if there is, would you identify it for

21

me?

22

MR. JONES:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

I don't

It would be the amended return form.
The amended return form, which is a

kind of return.
MR. JONES:

It is an amended return.

QUESTION:

1

But there's no way, is there, to file

2

a claim for refund at that date without also filing a

3

return?

4

MR. JONES:

No, sir, I'm sorry, I must disagree.

5

The courts have routinely held that you can file a refund

6

claim informally.

7

QUESTION:

But there's no form.

There's no

8

regular IRS form that the average taxpayer who has

9

overwithheld can go to the office and say, would you give

10

me the refund form.

11

MR. JONES:

What would he get?
There's no IRS form, but there is --

12

but you don't have to use an IRS form to make a refund

13

claim, according to the courts.

would probably ask him to file a return --

2

between the IRS and the Service, the taxpayer was told,

3

Can you explain how that would have played out

if the Service, instead of sending the notice of

deficiency, had first filed a substituted return for the

MR. JONES:

They have the same

I can't say definitively.

I'm

8

sorry, Justice Kennedy, I don't know, but what I am

9

confident about is that this thing that we call a

10

substituted return is not a return of the taxpayer, it is

11

simply -- for example, a taxpayer, we might have a W-2.

12

It might show some information about income and

13

withholdings.

14

That might be all that we know.

For example, that might have been all that we

15

know in this case, and based upon that limited knowledge,

16

we "prepare a substituted return," but what we're really

17

doing is filling in the blanks as best we know.

18

The definition of a return in the code I think

19

is best described in 6611(h), which talks about a return

20

in processable form.

21

filed by the taxpayer that purports to be a return, and

22

that contains all of the information from which the

I'm not familiar with a definition

of a claim for refund in the -QUESTION:

8

what does the word claim mean in this section --

MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

11

Well, Justice --- and you've just told me the only

way you can file a claim is by filing a return --

12

MR. JONES:

13

QUESTION:

14

We're asking -- the question is,

No, sir, I didn't.
-- but yet the claim doesn't include

the term, return.

15

MR. JONES:

I did not say that.

The courts have

16

held quite clearly that you can file a claim informally,

17

and you don't have to use a return, and let me be

specific, a claim for refund --

Absolutely.

What case gives us an example of

that?
MR. JONES:

In our brief, in our reply brief we

cite the Salzman Treatise, which elaborates a lot of cases

2

that deal with this subject.
QUESTION:

A claim is -

Do I understand correctly that it

3

wouldn't have made any difference as long as he didn't

4

file a return?

5

MR. JONES:

6

QUESTION:

Yes.
As you read the statute, he must have

7

filed a return first.

He could have filed a formal,

8

informal, all the claims in the world, and on your reading

9

of the statute it would not have made any difference.

10

What he had to file, what he didn't file before the notice

11

of a deficiency was not a claim, but a return.

12

MR. JONES:

That's absolutely correct.

The

13

statute makes the distinction between taxpayers who have

14

been delinquent in filing returns and taxpayers who have

15

not, and by its very words it provides an abbreviated

16

period of recovery for taxpayers who have not filed a

17

return before the notice of deficiency was issued.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, other than this, rather

19

unusual circumstances of this case, is there any other

20

time that the 2-year look-back period would apply under

21

this subsection?

22

MR. JONES:

QUESTION:

24
25

Well, it applies whenever -Does it apply only to circumstances

of this case, and in no other instance?
MR. JONES:

It applies routinely when the

3

the 3-year look-back if you have filed the return before

4

the claim for refund arises.
QUESTION:

5

That would be the -- you only get

Now, has the IRS been totally

6

consistent in its position and interpretation of this

7

statute?

8

the Government took in the Miller case in the Ninth

9

Circuit, and with the Revenue Ruling 76-511.

10

It seems rather inconsistent with the position

MR. JONES:

There's a long answer to that

11

question which I'd like to give, and I'd like to try to

12

give it in a logical order.

13

The first part of the answer to your question

14

is, has the Government been consistent about tax court

15

cases, and the answer to that is plainly yes.

16

in Revenue Ruling 57-354, which is quoted at page 48 of

17

the petition appendix, the Commissioner has stated that

18

the status of a claim for refund must be determined as of

19

the time it is filed and that if, as the time it is filed,

20

no return has then been filed, you only get a 2-year look-

21

back period.

22

Since 1957,

The tax court has consistently reached the same

23

conclusion under its own jurisdiction since the early

24

1970's.

25

newly minted simply ignores this historical record, and

The suggestion that our position in this case is

13

r*-'

1

moreover, factually, the suggestion of respondent that we

2

would routinely pay refund claims in this context is

3

demonstrably incorrect, as the tax court found, because

4

6512(a) of the Internal Revenue Code says that if a notice

5

of deficiency is issued, and the taxpayer files a claim in

6

tax court, then no refund or credit shall be allowed

7

except as the tax court determines, so in tax court cases

8

the Commissioner has no administrative authority to award

9

a refund.

10

We are deprived of it by statute.
Now, the question that you're really, I think,

11

focusing on is, have we been the same about district court

12

cases and tax court cases, and I think -- there's a short

13

answer to that and a long explanation.

14

The short answer is, it is not perfectly clear

15

whether in each and every situation the refund periods are

16

supposed to be the same in district court and tax court
cases, and there is no basis for assuming that Congress

18

intended them to always be the same, and I'd like to

19

explain the latter part first.

20

There's no reason to think Congress necessarily

21

intended the same periods always to apply in district

22

court and tax court.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, may I derail you just for

24

a moment to go back to where you were in the tax court?

25

One might wonder whether the Commissioner was

1

always consistent in the tax court because part of the

2

history of this case that initially this taxpayer, that

3

the answer in the -- to the petition in the tax court

4

didn't raise a time bar, and in fact the taxpayer got a

5

letter that said, you're going to get a refund check, and

6

then it was over a year after the initial answer that the

7

amendment was made to assert the time bar.

8

MR. JONES:

I believe that you've accurately

9

described the facts, Justice Ginsburg, but I also believe

10

that the Commissioner raising the defense in this case is

11

something that he has -- she, in this case, has

12

consistently done since the issue has been presented.

13
14

The fact that there may have been a delay in
it's assertion in this case --

15

QUESTION:

16

wasn't -- there was an answer.

17

from the start, and yet over a year went by without this

18

being asserted.

19

MR. JONES:

It's not just a delay.

There just

The time bar was obvious

It is -- I think it's fair to say

20

that it's relatively common for defenses to be amended,

21

for answers to be amended, and I would hope the Court

22

wouldn't draw any inference from that in this case.

23

There's really no reason to.

24
25

I mean, as I emphasized just a point ago, we
don't have authority to make a refund in a tax court case

1

unless the tax court has determined an overpayment, so we

2

have to -- when we think a refund might be appropriate, we

3

have to submit an agreed order that falls within the

4

jurisdiction of the tax court.

5

It may have been -- and I'm speculating here.

6

It may have been that in preparing a draft of some kind of

7

agreed order to submit in this case, that it then occurred

8

to counsel, oh, wait a minute, this case isn't within the

9

tax court's jurisdiction.

It may be that that's the

10

mechanics that led to this being asserted at the time that

11

it was.

Now - -

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, can I just follow up,

14

because I didn't think I got a complete answer to my

15

question.

16

I asked if there were cases involving claims for

17

refunds such as the notations -- and you referred on pages

18

14 and 15 of your reply brief -- in which those informal

19

claims had been made without there having previously been

filed any return at all.

Justice Stevens, frankly you would have to write out

almost all of 65

of all the second clause of the first sentence of 65

says that, and if the claim for refund is filed at a time

when no return has been filed, then you get a 2-year look-

Congress didn't think that a claim for refund and a return

were independent documents that could be filed in

different orders.

clearly also provided an abbreviated period, an

abbreviated look-back period for the taxpayer who fails to

Congress clearly contemplated that, and

the Government's theory of why, when the return is later

I think I

20

may disagree with you as to the reason, though perhaps not

as to the result.

MR. JONES:

Well, the reason that we see is that

3

Where are you reading from

Mr. Jones?
MR. JONES:

6512(b)(3)(C) says that you can

4

award a refund based upon a prior refund claim filed

5

before the notice of deficiency.

6

can award a refund based upon a claim assumed to arise on

7

the date of the notice of deficiency.

8

for engrafting onto this statute an additional refund

9

jurisdiction for subsequent refund claims, which is what

10
11

6512(b)(3)(B) says you

There is no basis

the court of appeals theories would require.
You'd have to be adding a clause to the statute,

12

and you'd be adding a clause to the statute that would

13

contradict the clauses that already exist.

14

Now, this Court has said on several occasions

15

that the jurisdictional limitations on refunds are limited

16

waivers of sovereign immunity that must be strictly

17

applied and strictly adhered to by the judiciary.

18

In this case, the court of appeals acknowledged

19

that it was not applying the statute as Congress wrote it.

20

The court said, we will not use the imputed refund claim

21

under 6512(b)(3)(B) to decide whether a 2-year or 3-year

22

look-back period applies, but that is precisely what

Congress told them to do.

Moreover, as I've already described, the

jurisdiction of the two courts is different, even as we

stand here, because of the variance of the claim doctrine,

and so there's no reason to assume, ab initio, that in

That's correct, isn't it.

But in the court of claims, if the notice of

Now, a claim -- a return has been defined under

4

case law as meaning any document which contains sufficient

5

information to allow the IRS to determine tax liability.

6

Now, the IRS in its construction of this section

7

has ignored -- in every brief it submitted to the tax

8

court, the Fourth Circuit and this Court, the last phrase

9

of the statute treats it as surplusage, stating the

10

grounds upon which the tax court finds that there's an

11

overpayment.

12

In fact, the IRS went so far as to excise it

13

from its quotation of the statute on page 5 of its reply

14

brief, but this language is important, because if the

15

claim referred to in 6512(b)(3)(B) states the grounds upon

16

which the tax court finds that there is an overpayment,

17

that would constitute the same information that would be

MR. SCHWARTZ:

That's correct.

The statute of

limitations on filing, in theory, as Justice Breyer

11

suggested, that goes on forever.

12

6402-3(a)(5) says that a return showing an overpayment

13

constitutes a claim for refund, and it's deemed filed on

14

the same day, so a return filed several years after the

15

due date would be a timely claim, but the limitation on

16

amount would limit the taxpayer to the amount paid in the

17

3 years preceding the filing of the return, so there's no

danger of stale claims, and there's no danger of a stale

When would the 2-year look-back ever come into play?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

2

The 2-year look-back would come

3

into play the same way it would come into play if we were

4

not dealing with the tax court, and that is where the

5

2 years from the date the tax is paid provides for a

6

longer period of limitation than 3 years from the date the

return was filed, and that could come up in connection

8

with an audit.

For example, if a taxpayer, 199

is the first 2-year rule.

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Your Honor, there are several

reasons why that second 2-year rule does not apply to a
taxpayer who's required to file a return.

11

QUESTION:

I'm not -- I don't want to know when

12

the 2-year rule -- I want to know how it squares with your

notion that when the statute says claim, it means a valid

claim, that is, a claim accompanied by a tax return.

15

That's your principle.

16

MR. SCHWARTZ:

My principle is that a valid

claim for refund where no original return has been filed

18

must be on a tax return.

19

QUESTION:

Well, that

20

doesn't square with the language of 6511(a). It clearly

contemplates a claim where no return has been filed.

MR. SCHWARTZ:

The -- there are two or three reasons why that

Your Honor, may I explain?

7

second 2-year rule where no return has been filed does not

8

apply to Mr. Lundy.

9

The first is, if -- the first 3-year rule,

10

3 years from the date the return is filed, or 2 years from

11

the date the tax is paid, whichever is later, covers all

12

possible situations, because if you assume that an

3

original claim could be filed that was not a return, it

4

would be covered by that first 2-year rule, making the

5

second 2-year rule surplusage.

6

The second reason is, if the -- if it was

7

possible to file a claim for refund that -- where no

8

original return has been filed, it would be limited by the

9

first 2-year rule, because the first 2-year rule would

20

provide a longer period of time than the 3-year rule,

21

that the second 2-year rule would be surplusage.

22

so

The second reason is, if, as the IRS contends,

23

that the first sentence of 65

24

required taxes, including the second 2-year rule, or if no

25

return was required, and the second sentence of 65

(a) applies to return-

applies to stamps, then there's no rule to cover

2

nonreturn-required taxes, so that second 2-year rule,

3

which is surplusage for a return-required tax, must apply

to nonreturn-required tax.
Third, as originally enacted in 1954, the

It was an absolute minimum 3-year period,

not possibly apply to a return-required tax.
In fact, the tax court in this very case stated

that under the '54 code as originally enacted, the

13

taxpayer would have been entitled to a refund even under

1

the problem has arisen because Congress took the short cut

2

of incorporating the general statute of limitations into

3

6512, and the triggering points, the triggering points for

4

the limitation periods in 6511 are couched in terms of

5

claim for refund, because an administrative claim for

6

refund is a prerequisite to the granting of an

7

administrative refund or the jurisdiction of the district

8

court.

9

So it -- the statute's not self-executing when

10

it's incorporated by reference into 6512, and so there had

11

to be a reference to the word claim to trigger the

12

limitation periods in 6511, because the taxpayer would not

13

have filed a claim for refund in the tax court because

14

that's not a prerequisite, and this has always been

15

interpreted as a reference date for application of the

16

limitation periods in the tax court, so that if the

17

statute was open to the taxpayer on that date, if he could

18

have filed a timely claim for refund on the date that the

19

notice was mailed, he's entitled to a refund in the tax

That's a plausible argument.

I don't

the Service to grant refunds under these circumstances.

For one, I would -- the explosion of cases that occurred

7

since 1991 and 1992, this Court in Fribourg Navigation

the IRS theory of this case, he was barred by the statute

MR. SCHWARTZ:

1

2

You mean assuming that he somehow

would be able to file a refund suit?
QUESTION:

3

In other words, doesn't the look --

4

the very purpose of the look-back provision to stop that

5

kind of thing where you, many years down the road, pay a

6

small piece, a small overpayment, claim that back, and

7

then -- and use that as leverage to go 7 years back to get

8

the rest of the overpayment?

9

of having these look-back provisions?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

10

Isn't that the very purpose

Yes, but the look-back rule is

11

the teeth of the limitation provisions, and prevents stale

12

claims.

13

But Your Honor, this case is very much like

14

Williams, because the very purpose of the tax court is to

15

assist taxpayers like Mr. Lundy to allow him to contest an

16

asserted deficiency without first -- without prepaying,

17

and yet, once he filed his petition in the tax court, he

18

was in a position where he had no realistic alternative,

19

and no remedy, because his only choice once that notice of

20

deficiency is mailed to him is either to prepay the tax

21

and file a suit in the district court, or go to the tax

22

court, where he forfeits his refund, so that remedy --

23

QUESTION:

Maybe that's one of the penalties for

24

not filing a tax return when you're supposed to.

25

there are all sorts of penalties.

I mean,

Isn't it conceivable

that this is one of them?

2

MR.

SCHWARTZ:

Your Honor,

there are penalties.

There's a penalty for late filing,

of your refund is not one of those penalties.

that remains to be seen.

QUESTION:

Well,

But the mere notion that this is

unthinkable doesn't strike me as self-evident.

I mean, we

10

begin with a taxpayer who didn't file a tax return when he

11

should have.

12

MR. SCHWARTZ:

That's correct, Your Honor, but

3

if we assume that Mr. Lundy had a neighbor in the same

4

position who overpaid his '87 income taxes,

5

due on April

6

never got a notice of deficiency, he filed on the same

date, on December 28, more than 2 but less than 3 years,

he'd get his refund.

1

afforded taxpayers a 3-year grace period, and this is

2

taken away from them by the mailing of a notice of

3

deficiency.

Why --

QUESTION:

4

That's the question.

Has Congress

5

done that, or has Congress said, if you wait beyond

6

2 years, you're in jeopardy of getting that notice of

7

deficiency first.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

8

9

That's nowhere to be found in the statute.
QUESTION:

10
11

But Congress has not said that.

That's what we're arguing about in

this case, I take it.

12

MR. SCHWARTZ:

13

QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor --

I still don't see how you read the

14

statute -- I mean, you know, I -- it makes sense for

15

Congress to say, everybody gets 3 years.

It also makes

6

sense to say, if you don't file your return, you get 2

7

years.

your return, 3 years if you do.

different, whether it's -- but what does it say?

Maybe they ought to say, 2 years if you don't file
Maybe it's a little
I can't

20

work out -- I mean, I can't figure out any way to get

it

22

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Our interpretation is that the

23

taxpayer is in the same position in the tax court as he

24

would be in the district court, the claims court, or

25

filing an administrative claim for refund.

QUESTION:

1

How would Congress have said what the

2

Government says it said more clearly than what is here?

3

You apparently -- I gather from an earlier comment you

4

apparently think it would have been, the problem is that

5

(3)(B), what was it, 6512(b)(3)(B) does not say, as if on

6

the date of the mailing, but just if on the date of the

7

mailing, but it couldn't possibly say as if.
Within the period which would be applicable, as

8

9

if on the date of the mailing?

No.

I mean, the way to

10

say what the Government says it says is precisely what is

11

written here, within the period that would be applicable

12

under section 6511 if on the date, not as if.

13

put an as in there.

14
15

I wouldn't

They would be totally incoherent.

MR. SCHWARTZ:

But that's what the Government

does in all of its briefs.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. SCHWARTZ:

18

QUESTION:

They say, as if --

No, no --- assuming that.

No, you say that it requires as if,

19

in order to get to their interpretation, but it seems to

20

me their interpretation is precisely what's written

21

there -- within the period which would be applicable if

22

the notice of deficiency had been filed.

23

you get an as if there.

24

MR. SCHWARTZ:

25

I don't know how

It doesn't make sense at all.
The language is not clear, Your

Honor.

My time is limited.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. SCHWARTZ:

I --

It seems perfectly clear to me.
My time is limited.

I'd like to

4

take the opportunity to persuade you that the claim should

5

be considered a return.
There are two other reasons that claim in this

6

7

context must be considered to be return.

8

6402-2(b) requires that a claim contain the detailed

9

statement of the grounds upon which the claim is based.

Treasury Reg

10

That, again, is the same information that if on a document

11

submitted to the IRS under case law and under a '74

12

revenue ruling would constitute a return and finally, and

13

most important, Regulation 6402-3(a)(1) requires, whereas

14

here no original return has been filed, that the taxpayer

15

must file his claim on a return.

16

So the IRS is asking you to ignore its own

17

regulations and treat the claim referred to in

18

6512(b)(3)(B) as a defective claim, and I think that's an

19

impermissible construction.

20

to Congress an intent that that claim is a valid claim.
QUESTION:

21

I think you have to attribute

Whereas I guess you take the position

22

that in 6511(a) the term claim can include valid claims

23

and invalid claims that have to be corrected to become

24

valid, and the 2-year rule would apply to the invalid

25

claim.

QUESTION:

4

Well, Your Honor --

And then if -- you know, one filed

without a return.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, I think the key thing here

is that a claim filed on a return, that a return showing

an overpayment, is the equivalent of a claim under the

Treasury regs -- own regulations.

They make the
