CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in Number 94-8769, Tommy L. Rutledge v. United States.
Mr. Levenstam.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY LEVENSTAM

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

9

MR. LEVENSTAM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

This case presents the question of what limits

11

the Double Jeopardy Clause places upon the punishment to

12

be imposed upon a defendant found guilty of violating 21

13

U.S.C. section 848, the continuing criminal enterprise

14

statute, and section 846, the drug conspiracy statute,

15

where the same conduct constitutes the conspiracy and the

16

in concert element of section 848.

17

QUESTION:

Is it the Double Jeopardy Clause in

18

the constitutional sense, or simply a concept that's

19

somewhat like Double Jeopardy when we're interpreting

20

congressional intent?

21

MR. LEVENSTAM:

The Court's analysis has

22

incorporated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the

23

Constitution historically.

24

without reference to that, and then there have been a

25

number of cases which rely on the Double Jeopardy Clause.

There have been cases decided

QUESTION:

1

But do all parties concede, or at

2

least do you agree that if Congress wanted multiple or

3

cumulative punishments set for the two crimes, that they

4

could constitutionally enact a provision that would secure

5

that objective?
MR. LEVENSTAM:

6

Yes, Your Honor.

Under Missouri

7

v. Hunter and a long line of cases from this Court, that

8

is clearly the case.
QUESTION:

9

So then we're really talking about

10

what Congress intended, rather than double jeopardy, are

11

we not?

12

MR. LEVENSTAM:

Well, the -- what Congress

13

intended in the multiple punishments context defines the

14

parameters of the double jeopardy protection.

15

QUESTION:

Which really means there isn't any

16

constitutional question involved, if Congress can provide

17

whatever it wants, and double jeopardy accordingly recedes

18

whatever Congress has provided.

19

MR. LEVENSTAM:

Well, double jeopardy does not

20

impose limitations on Congress, it's true.

21

analyzed to impose limitations upon the courts in imposing

22

Congress' will.

23

It's been

Whether it's actually necessary, given the

24

presence of the Due Process Clause, or even the body of

25

the Constitution, relative authority granted under Article

I or Article III, insofar as my client is concerned, he

2

would be as happy to have one of these convictions vacated

3

under any of those rubrics, but historically, looking at

4

the cases, they have analyzed these situations under the

5

double Jeopardy Clause.

6

QUESTION:

7

Congress' intent --

But then if we're concerned with

8

MR. LEVENSTAM:

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- as you agree, then why would

10

Congress intend to put the prosecutor at risk of having no

11

conviction -- let's say the CCE conviction gets wiped out

12

on appeal -- if the conspiracy conviction has not been

13

entered?

14

Why would we attribute such a will to Congress?

15

MR. LEVENSTAM:

I don't think you should

16

attribute such a will to Congress, and I don't believe

17

that that is what would happen.

18

Our suggestion as to what should happen in a

19

situation, it's clear under this Court's decision in Ball

20

that the prosecutor is entitled to charge both, to present

21

evidence as to both, to put both before the jury, and the

22

Court is entitled to accept a verdict back from the jury

23

with respect to both.

24
25

If the jury comes back and enters guilty
verdicts with respect to both, our position is that it

1

would be incumbent upon the district court to enter a

2

vacatur with respect to one or the other in that court's

3

discretion, and then when the entire case goes up on

4

appeal, and we would assume that the defendant, having

5

been found guilty, would take an appeal, both the guilty

6

verdict, the judgment entered upon the conviction -- for

7

instance, the CCE -- and the vacatur that the district

8

court entered on the conspiracy would be before the

9

appellate court.

10

It would be incumbent upon the defendant to

11

argue with respect to both of those counts everything that

12

he has, because the appellate court, having jurisdiction

13

over the entire case and all the orders therein because

14

the appeal is from a final appeal, if it determined that

15

the CCE count should be reversed based on some element of

16

CCE or some aspect of the case pertaining to an element

17

that distinguishes it from the underlying conspiracy, the

18

appellate court would have the authority to reverse the

19

vacatur on double jeopardy grounds at the same time.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

How would that work if there is no

judgment entered on the conspiracy count?
MR. LEVENSTAM:

Well, there would be a final

23

judgment entered in the case, and in the line on the

24

judgment form it would say, jury verdict vacated with

25

respect to the conspiracy, and then the court, the

1

appellate court could simply reverse the vacation of that,

2

and remand to the district court.

3

QUESTION:

The Government would have to appeal

4

that, though, to get the vacatur reversed, wouldn't it?

5

mean, the defendant isn't going to say, reverse the

6

vacatur.

7

MR. LEVENSTAM:

Well, the defendant won't say

8

that.

9

all orders merge in the final judgment order, the court

10
11

I

It's my understanding that a final appeal, because

would have the authority to -QUESTION:

Well, merge -- you've just used a

12

word that the Second Circuit -- what you describe seems to

13

be what the Second Circuit's position is, and yet in your

14

brief you reject that.

15

MR. LEVENSTAM:

Well, I reject that because the

16

Second Circuit's approach involves entering judgments of

17

conviction on two counts when we believe under the Ball

18

decision that judgments of conviction should be entered

19

under only one of the counts.

20

Congress' intent, and that, we believe, is backed up by

21

the force of the Double Jeopardy Clause.

22

QUESTION:

That, we believe, is

But isn't this all just formalism if

23

your end result is that the court on appeal could

24

reinstate the verdict on the conspiracy count in the event

25

that the CCE conviction were reversed on a ground peculiar

2

to that charge?
MR. LEVENSTAM:

Perhaps it may appear to be

3

formalism from the standpoint of the court, but from the

4

standpoint of the defendant who has a double jeopardy

5

interest here, he will have stood trial in public, perhaps

6

in his community, and under the Second Circuit means of

7

addressing this issue, he will have the additional stigma

8

which the Court mentioned in Ball of having two judgments

9

of conviction entered, really upon one offense.

10

QUESTION:

Why is --

11

QUESTION:

And you think the vacatur erases,

12

washes off that stigma?

13

MR. LEVENSTAM:

14

QUESTION:

This is not formalism?
Yes.

He's walking around in the community

15

with two convictions instead of one conviction and a

16

conviction plus vacatur.

17

MR. LEVENSTAM:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. LEVENSTAM:

20

QUESTION:

That's the difference.
Right.

He'll --

And that's not formalism.
No.

Why is there any additional stigma

21

when the second offense is essentially a lesser

22

included -- I mean, he's already got all the stigma he can

23

get from the first one.

24

redundant, isn't it?

25

The second is stigmatically

No, Your Honor, we don't think

I think --

QUESTION:

No, but why not?

4

MR. LEVENSTAM:

5

QUESTION:

Because --

What do they know about him as a

6

result of the second conviction that they don't know about

7

him as a result of the first?

8

9

MR. LEVENSTAM:

That he's been convicted on two

significant drug offenses, which are in fact one and the

10

same, that he has received two life sentences, and the

11

newspaper reports at the time of the sentencing noted the

12

number, the conviction total with respect to my client,

13

and it seems to me, although I've been involved in the

14

legal system nearly 20 years now, that for people who are

15

not, when they read the papers and see that someone has

16

received not one but two life sentences, they glean from

17

that that he committed not one but two exceptionally

heinous crimes, and under a --

QUESTION:

2

A district court order that the

lesser offense be simply suspended, he would suspend

QUESTION:

Something I never really

(Laughter.)

14

QUESTION:

15

Well, what do we do in the present

case?
MR. LEVENSTAM:

16

Our request with respect to this

17

would be that you remand to the district court with the

direction that one of the two convictions be vacated.

The judge gets a piece of paper, and the piece

of paper says, judgment on 846, then there's a blank or

something.

5

It's this piece of paper called a judgment, and in your

opinion, how should it read?

I mean, normally he'd fill in, convicted, all

Then 848, he'd fill in judgment of conviction.

After all, I mean, it sounds very technical and

very formal.

If he puts the wrong one and then on appeal

the other one's reversed, or something, you know, and what

happens when one party thinks that they are lesser

MR. LEVENSTAM:

QUESTION:

11

MR. LEVENSTAM:

Okay.

All right.
I don't believe that because,

12

typically, from a final judgment order, all orders entered

in the case are brought before the court of appeals, I

14

don't believe that the Government would have to file a

15

notice of appeal.

QUESTION:

I'm now an appellate court judge, and

17

I've just reversed the 848 conviction because of the lack

18

tell me, what do I do now?

know how to do it.

MR. LEVENSTAM:

I want to

Well, the vacatur is no longer

QUESTION:

But then does your client appeal

again from the second judgment, so that can be reviewed
for possible error?
MR. LEVENSTAM:

The -- in the typical case, and

12

this has happened, in 25 years, so infrequently that

13

it's -- that it -- there aren't a lot of examples to cite

14

to, but in the typical case, the only thing that the

15

district court would do would be to enter judgment and

16

then issue a sentence and the only question really left

17

for appeal would be the propriety of the sentence.

18

QUESTION:

Well, but doesn't -- wouldn't your

19

client have a right to claim some sort of error, perhaps

20

in the instructions, in the case of the judgment that's

21

now been entered against him?

22

to argue that on the previous appeal.

MR. LEVENSTAM:

QUESTION:

1

Yes, but the -- not all of the errors

2

might have been the basis for the decision.

Let's assume

3

that on the continuing criminal enterprise count some

4

element other than the conspiracy element was found to be

5

insufficiently supported by evidence, and the court says,

6

that's enough, we reverse.

7

Then we get back to the position that you posit.

8

The other conviction, the conspiracy conviction is brought

forward.

I presume at that point you would say, oh, well,

I now want to appeal this because there was insufficient

evidence of conspiracy.

If we say, look,

there is no cognizable extra stigma when you have a mere

Justice Souter, you're

absolutely correct with respect to a situation other than

affirmed concurrent sentences -- concurrent judgments,

separate judgments and separate concurrent sentences.

be treated the same as if there'd been only a CCE

verdict on only one of the two charges, not both.

MR. LEVENSTAM:

Nevertheless, it was clear that the possession statute was

17

in examining the statutory history, the legislative -- the

18

statutory structure and the legislative history, came to

19

the conclusion that Congress did not intend to cumulate

This Court held specifically that both could
The verdicts could be returned.

2

obviously, you're going to have to vacate the separate

3

convictions and the concurrent sentences for all but the

4

2113(d).
So I think within the Federal system -- perhaps

5
6

it was unfortunate I even interjected my State, but within

the Federal system, it is not unusual to submit lesser

included and the greater offense at the same time.
QUESTION:

In -- Ball you say was lesser

But there is a much more frequent occurrence

20

that distinguishes those two statutes, and that is,

somebody who is not a felon goes out, buys a gun -- it

22

happens all the time -- commits a felony, is convicted,

Now, every one of those guns is illegally

please the Court:
It is a consequence of petitioner's position

that a defendant who is validly found guilty by a jury of

two very serious Federal offenses, drug conspiracy and

13

CCE, should have the opportunity, under some

circumstances, to gain a windfall.

15

If he's able to have the CCE conviction -- since

16

the district court under petitioner's position may only

17

enter judgment on the CCE offense, if, on appeal, he's

18

able to have that conviction overturned, the defendant

19

will obtain the possibility of going free notwithstanding

20

that he's committed the drug conspiracy offense, that he's

21

been validly charged of that offense before a jury --

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Feldman, is that any different

from any normal lesser included offense situation in which

The basis of the normal way of

treating things, as you mentioned, is that it's assumed

20

wants one conviction, and in fact the way it's normally

21

submitted to the jury.

Of course, I understand you don't want to
concede that, but -MR. FELDMAN:

Well, I mean, I don't think so,

because I think that the question is what Congress

13

intended, and where Congress defined statutes in two

14

distinct sections of statutes, and moreover, where it

15

takes an offense like CCE, which is really dramatically

different from an underlying conspiracy, which involves

QUESTION:

Isn't it first up to us to decide

what Congress' intent was, and if we agree with you, why,

MR. FELDMAN:

QUESTION:

If --

You see, if we agree with you that

Congress intended two separate proceedings entirely, then

you win, period.

But if we disagree, and think that they

did intend one to be a lesser included offense of the

11

other, even though they're in separate provisions of the

12

code, then why shouldn't they be treated just like a

normal lesser included offense?

MR. FELDMAN:

If it were -- if they were treated

like normal lesser included offenses, and if it were made

16

clear that the procedure whereby you -- if the greater one

17

were reversed that the court could just enter judgment on

the lesser one, so long as the reason for the reversal

And the plurality in Jeffers assumed

without deciding that there was a lesser included offense.
MR. FELDMAN:

6

That's correct, but they still

7

went on, and we're basic --we are submitting this case to

8

the Court, and willing to accept the same assumption that

9

the Court adopted in Jeffers, and that is, we can assume

10

they are a greater and lesser included offense, but there

11

still remains the question of what Congress intended.
Jeffers stands for the proposition -- at least,

12

13

the plurality opinion in Jeffers -- that Congress intended

14

not to impose a greater prison term or a more substantial

15

fine, but Jeffers didn't address the question of whether

MR. FELDMAN:

classic conspiracy, the in concert with element doesn't

2

require proof of a conspiracy.

3

It only requires that the defendant act together

4

with a number of other people to organize an enterprise,

5

but it doesn't require that the other people who are

6

involved with the defendant necessarily know the criminal

7

goals, or the full criminal goals, of the enterprise.

8
9

If a defendant, for example, organizes a
business to transport merchandise from some country where

10

drugs are prevalent to the United States, and does so in a

11

fairly -- a shady and unusual way, there may be other

12

people who join with him possibly even thinking it's an

13

innocent enterprise, or possibly not, but who don't know

14

that in every one of those shipments is a large amount of

15

cocaine.

16

In that kind of a case, we think it's reasonable

17

to say that the defendant acted in concert with the other

18

five individuals even though they may -- they couldn't all

19

be found guilty of conspiracy.

20

For that reason -- and this was an argument also

21

that we submitted in Jefferson the Court didn't reach.

For that reason, we don't think that it's a classic

relationship of greater and lesser included offenses.

to me you look at the statute and see what the statute

And when you're working with such refined

notions of punishment, I think it's important to also try

to figure out how -- whether the Congress wouldn't have

wanted that kind of refined notion of punishment to get in

15

the way of what is truly one of its primary goals, which

is seeing to it that a defendant who is -- who commits and

is convicted of both section 846 conspiracy and a section

evil that Congress was legislating against there and, in

took the two statutes, which really by happenstance were

prosecuted for those two.

But I don't -- I think really the only relevance

of Garrett is that it recognized that that wasn't the

issue that it was dealing with in that -- the Court was

7

As I was saying, the Second Circuit's approach

MR. FELDMAN:

It's really more than that.

It's

2

that the defendant -- the jury necessarily found that the

3

defendant committed all of the elements of that offense,

4

and then what the issue in the court of appeals is, some

5

element that doesn't have to do with that offense, so in a

6

very real sense, the jury has convicted him of a crime and

7

the jury has found him guilty of all of the elements of

8

the offense, and I think the proposition is that having

9

done that, there's no reason why the court of appeals --

10

generally what's done is in orders, it remands in orders

11

to the district court to enter judgment on the lesser

12

included offense.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Feldman, if we don't make what

14

you regard as the error of treating this -- these two

15

offenses as greater and lesser, then, in fact, there

16

would, I suppose be a further stigmatic element quite

17

apart from the $50 in the conviction for conspiracy, since

18

that need not be on your view assumed under CCC, and so if

19

we read the law right, why shouldn't you lose just on

20

straightforward analysis of cumulative effect?

21

MR. FELDMAN:

I guess this Court has never gone

22

so far as to hold that that level of effect really

23

constitutes a punishment that in any real sense should

24

determine to guide the analysis or in particular should

With respect to the Jeffers --

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Levenstam, may I -- I'm sorry,

this.

10

What's the significance of the $50 here?
MR. LEVENSTAM:

Well, under this Court's per

11

curiam decision in Ray, there really are no longer

12

concurrent sentences in the Federal system, because each

13

judgment of conviction carries with it a separate $50

14

assessment.

MR. LEVENSTAM:

and the question it specifically answered was, would it

2

call the critical inquiry whether Congress intended to

3

punish these two statutes separately, and the answer there

4

was no, and that answer was not only shared by the four

5

members of the plurality, but I believe my reading, if you

6

look at footnote 5 of Justice Stevens' concurrence, he

7

said there were two punishments imposed unconstitutionally

8

as well, so eight justices there, regardless of the lesser

9

included issue, said specifically Congress did not intend

10
11

to punish violations of 846 and 848 separately.

Mr. Levenstam, what is your position

on the Tinder approach?

13

MR. LEVENSTAM:

That is, CCE, only conviction,

Assuming that you can interject

the Morris v. Mathews analysis, which is, if there has

been some prejudice to the defendant as a result of the
