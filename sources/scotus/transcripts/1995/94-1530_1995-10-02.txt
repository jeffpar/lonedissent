JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Cundra, are you ready?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN D. CUNDRA

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CUNDRA:

9
10

11
12

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
The case before the Court today concerns whether
an order of a district court remanding a case on

3

jurisdictional or other than equitable grounds, a case

4

which had been removed pursuant to Federal Bankruptcy

5

Court jurisdiction, may be reviewed for error in the

6

circuit court.

7

It is petitioner's contention that the

8

bankruptcy removal statute,

452 of title 28, which

9

prohibits review in the circuit court of equitable remands

20

does not apply to the remand in this case, as it was on

21

jurisdictional or other than equitable grounds, and that

22

the general removal statute,

23

remand in this case, which was premised on a demonstrably

1

erroneous holding that the removal was simply untimely,

2

petitioner Things Remembered should be permitted to appeal

3

this remand and to seek the correction of that holding.

4

QUESTION:

May I ask a preliminary question?

5

The briefs mainly argue about whether either statute

6

prohibits review.

7

grants you the right to review, and in what language?

8

9

Would you explain to me what statute

MR. CUNDRA:

The statute that would grant the

right of review would be 158(d), I believe, of title 28,

10

which grants review from final orders or decisions of the

11

district court sitting as an appellate court over

12

bankruptcy matters.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. CUNDRA:

And is this a final order?
I think it is a final order in the

15

context of this Court's holding in the Cohen case, that it

16

is a -- under the collateral order doctrine, it finally

17

determines a disputed issue between the parties, it's an

18

important issue that doesn't go to the merits of the

19

controversy, and would be unreviewable on appeal.

20
21

QUESTION:
order under Cohen?

But your theory is it's a collateral
That's --

22

MR. CUNDRA:

23

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice.
And you have -- you're relying on the

24

Third Circuit Pacor case for that preliminary -- for how

25

you characterize this as a Cohen v. Beneficial -4

3

MR. CUNDRA:

Yes, Justice.

I believe there are

other cases which address that issue as well.
QUESTION:

Can you explain to me what sense it

4

would make to say that, in general, removal is not

5

reviewable at all, then we know Congress wanted to take

6

into account a different -- to make the remand larger

7

rather than smaller, and then to say -- and for that

8

larger, no review but for what was always understood never

9

to be reviewable, suddenly in the bankruptcy context it's

10
11

reviewable?

What possible sense does that reading make?

MR. CUNDRA:

One has to consider the context.

12

The context is the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978.

13

to 1978, this country's bankruptcy jurisdiction was

14

extremely limited.

15

bankruptcy court was that referees in bankruptcy who had

16

the jurisdiction, which was called summary jurisdiction,

17

which was only property in the actual or constructive

18

possession of the court.

19
20
21

Prior

The only jurisdiction of the

There was also plenary jurisdiction, but it was
only by consent.
In 1978, Congress determined that the Bankruptcy

22

Act was not being effectively administered -- Chapter 11

23

cases, what are now Chapter 11 cases were not being

24

effectively administered, and it passed a brand new

25

statute with a very broad jurisdiction over all cases

1

arising in, arising under, or related to a bankruptcy-

2

case .
And Congress determined that in order to be

3
4

effective it had to grab all litigation in whatever court,

5

Federal, State, or tribal, and bring it into one central

6

forum so that the bankruptcy court could adjudicate the

7

estate of the debtor and adjudicate in a fair manner

8

consistent with the interests of all creditors, not just

9

the two private litigants, and it created the central

10
11

forum.
It created a new court which ultimately the

12

delegation of power was so great to an Article I court

13

this Court struck down that statute, or had it amended in

14

the Northern Pipeline and Marathon decision.

15

But that's what justified the broad jurisdiction

to get all matters before one court.

statute, reaching into any court, even a Federal court, to

19

bring a case before the bankruptcy court.

20

It justified the

But recognizing there may be inequities in that

21

even though it was to prevent delay of bankruptcy cases,

22

it provided a broad remand power to the bankruptcy judge

23

which would not be reviewable, and that remand power that

24

was not reviewable was not only for decisions to remand

25

but also for decisions not to remand, a bar to appellate

removal context, 1447.

A decision not to remand is

3

reviewable under 1447 .

A decision not to remand under

4

1452 is not reviewable, because it's a discretionary-

5

decision .

QUESTION:

May I interrupt you just there?

In -- forgetting bankruptcy for a moment, a

decision not to remand is reviewable in the ordinary case,

you think?

It's not prohibited, but is that a

collateral order, a decision not to remand?

14

MR. CUNDRA:

A decision not to remand would not

15

be a collateral order, it would be reviewable at the end

16

of the case.

district court's decision not to remand, a district

motion is made too late under

MR. CUNDRA:

That's untimely.
That would be governed by

Well, what about -Which sets forth the time limits --

I'm sorry.

QUESTION:

7

MR. CUNDRA:

Yes.
And the time limits that are set

8

forth in 9027 can be enlarged by the bankruptcy court

under Bankruptcy Rule 9006, and it's to treat any remand

motion as a contested proceeding under 90 4.

determine what the nature of the relationship is to that

enterprise will be liquidated or reorganized.
QUESTION:

2

Perhaps you've answered my question

3

in such detail that I couldn't quite follow it, but my

4

question is, what is the authority of the court to remand

5

a case that is untimely removed, under your theory?

6

MR. CUNDRA:

7

QUESTION:

In the bankruptcy -Because if you say 1447, then we say

8

that your argument fails, so I have to know what your

9

theory is.

10

MR. CUNDRA:

In the bankruptcy context, if it

11

has not been properly removed under 1452(a) from a Federal

12

or State court, then it -- the court would not have

13

jurisdiction and would have to return it or dismiss it.

14

The procedure in the bankruptcy context of how

15

you accomplish that is provided by 9027(d), which is a

16

motion to remand, to return the case to the jurisdiction

17

from which it came in the first place if there was no

18

authority to remove it in the first place.

19

QUESTION:

But under your view, you cannot refer

20

to 1447 for any case that's removed under 1452, or am I

21

misstating your position?

22

MR. CUNDRA:

One should not, because they were

23

separate statutory schemes which are both comprehensive in

24

their own domain, and exclusive within their own domain.

25

They cannot be treated together.

3

QUESTION:

So much so that there is no express

provision for remand of untimely removed cases under 1452.
MR. CUNDRA:

In the statute, it doesn't use the

4

word remand.

5

1452, proved by this Court, does, and it provides in

6

9027(d) that would be by a remand motion under 9014 of the

7

bankruptcy rules.

The bankruptcy rule that's applicable to

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Cundra, generally we don't

find any kind of repeal by implication of another statute

10

because a new one's adopted, and it's unclear to me why

11

you think that section 1447 does not remain available to a

12

district court even though there may be a bankruptcy

13

proceeding.

14

I mean, the district court remanded in this case

15

because of a procedural defect, and I don't see why 1447

16

wasn't available to the court to rely upon to get that

17

defect corrected.

MR. CUNDRA:

Under the facts of this case, even

if you imported 1447 into 1452 -QUESTION:

Don't import it.

Just say, it's

21

still on the books, it's available to the court, and

22

that's what the court can look to.

23

MR. CUNDRA:

If you were to do that in this

24

case, it would not change the result that there is no

25

basis to bar review of this remand order, because 1447

it comes to procedural defects, you have to make a motion

QUESTION:

6

In this case --

that statute justifies remands to State court, whereas the

MR. CUNDRA:

It was, but 1447, even if it

why it doesn't make sense.
MR. CUNDRA:

I believe it doesn't make sense for

the following reasons.
First, you have to relate it to what the basis

5

of the enactment is, which is this broad expansion of

6

jurisdiction in the bankruptcy courts with the

7

corresponding remand, and with jurisdiction not being

8

defined, not delineated by Congress -- very broad, related

c

to the case, but not delineated, left to the courts to

10
11

flesh out that jurisdiction.
Now, that jurisdiction, because bankruptcy

12

courts before only had summary jurisdiction, had no in

13

personam jurisdiction, now that jurisdiction of related-

14

to means all of this litigation we are going to be

15

removing from State or Federal courts that were never

16

removable under bankruptcy before, never.

17

And how should we delineate that related-to

18

jurisdiction?

19

to the courts to delineate it, and since it's only being

20

delineated or defined by the courts in removal cases, we

21

needed to have the court of appeals review that and

22

establish a Nationwide understanding of what this new

23

jurisdiction is that never existed in our history before.

24
25

Congress didn't delineate it.

QUESTION:

But may I interrupt?

they also gave additional grounds for removal on any

intended to pick up the problem in the Thermtron case that

it seem somewhat inconsistent to say they would -- and

You will acknowledge that this is not

4

MR. WEISENSELL:

I -- particularly the 1452

5

sections, subsection (a) and subsection (b) of 1452, and I

6

think the reason for that again, Your Honor, is that

7

Congress had the whole legislative history of 1447 and

8

what led up to that and the act of 1887 and 100 years of

9

the statute and the history behind that and the

10

interpretations of this Court before it when it enacted

11

the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, which put in place I

12

believe it was 1478 at that time, which became 1452, and I

13

believe that's the reason why there is no further

14

delineation.

15

The Congress could certainly have said in 1452

16

that it expressly intended that these particular orders

17

would be the only kinds of orders that there would not be

18

a review of, and it didn't say that, and that gets back to

19

my point earlier that this Court has held on occasions

20

And that is

That's your alternative argument.
And that relates back to the

legislative history behind 1452, where they talk about

such things in that legislative history as jurisdiction by

ambush, and it's not equitable for a party to be subject

7

to jurisdiction in some distant bankruptcy court when all

8

they have is a simple State court action that they're

entitled to have and have a right to have litigated in the

terms like equity and jurisdiction, to me it appears as

interchangeably in that legislative history, and that's

why I believe that the legislative history of 1452

intended to include that within the word equitable,

approach?

2

that 1452 is an add-on.

3

You are giving alternative arguments.

One is

It doesn't displace 1441 to 1447.

The other is, it is self-contained, but a judge

4

in deciding what is equitable, what is appropriate, can

5

say the closest thing that I have is the scheme of 1441 to

6

1447, so I will plug that into the word equitable.

equitable, appropriate, to remand on any ground that a

court would have remanded under in 14 -- under the 1441 to

9

1447 regime.

MR. WEISENSELL:

Your Honor,

It is

I believe that's a

11

slightly different interpretation, but it serves the

12

purpose, and I would agree with your analysis that you can

13

plug that in, and in fact a portion of the legislative

14

history does indicate, and I'm citing to the House report

15

and Senate report at the time of the enactment of the

16

Bankruptcy Reform Act.

17

And I'm on page 51 thereof, where it indicates

18

presumably an order of the bankruptcy court refusing to

19

accept jurisdiction and in effect remanding the matter to

another court would not be appealable in the same manner

21

that an order of the United States district court

22

remanding a case to the State court from which it was

23

removed is not reviewable, on appeal or otherwise.

a number of cases, including the Thermtron case, so

Congress was aware of the 1447 scheme at the time that it

enacted 1447, and I think your analysis can also be used

4

to plug that in as a "equitable ground" when there is no

5

jurisdiction under 1452.
Just one other point, Your Honors.

6

As we

7

indicated in our brief, there are a number of other

8

special removal statutes, and we cited a couple of cases

9

under the Federal Drivers Act, and also under the

10

Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement

11

Act, and those cases, in those statutes there are specific

12

removal and remand provisions that are set up.

13

And those cases also indicate, although they are

14

not decisions of this Court, they are decisions from other

15

circuit courts of appeals, that in enacting those

16

statutes, that Congress did not intend to set aside 1447

also have very specific remand -- removal and remand

procedures.
I cite the Court to that authority which again

is not from this Court, it's from other circuit courts of

Two quick points.

The concept of reading

jurisdiction into 1452, whether you consider it equitable

8

to do that or import 1447 or not, cannot -- would

9

fundamentally change the law of jurisdiction that's ever

10

existed with respect to removal and remand, because 1452

11

deals with the decisions not to remand as well, so

12

retention of jurisdiction under 1452 would be forever

unreviewable by any court.

don't know if that means that when it's part of the final

because you often review on mandamus.

never could even look to jurisdiction.

QUESTION:

But if it was really a case of

subject matter jurisdiction, the Constitution would trump

any such statute, right, because Article III says what

Congress can tell the Federal court they can do.

15

MR. CUNDRA:

So subject matter jurisdiction is

always reviewable because of the limitation on -- the
