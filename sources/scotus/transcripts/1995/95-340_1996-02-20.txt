ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE S. GOLD

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GOLD:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Last term, this Court in North Star Steel

12

3

Company summarized the basic aspects of the WARN Act,

4

which is the statute which generates this case as well.

5

We set out the pertinent portion of the Court's opinion on

6

page 9 of our opening brief, the blue brief, and very

7

simply stated as the Court noted WARN is a statute which

8

puts a condition on employers on plant closings and mass

9

layoffs.

20

The employer is supposed to notify, among

21

others, each representative of the affected employees if

22

the facility is one in which the employees have an

23

exclusive representative.

24
25

An employer who violates the notice provision is
liable for penalties by way of a civil action that may be

brought in any district court, and as the court concluded

2

by noting, the class of plaintiffs includes both aggrieved

3

employees or their unions as representatives, who may

4

collect back pay for each day of violation not to exceed

5

60 days.

6

In this case, the union brought a WARN act case

7

concerning a plant closing, alleging that Brown Group had

8

proceeded without providing the proper notice.

9

Circuit held that the union did not have standing to bring

The Eighth

10

and prosecute that lawsuit and to seek the statutory

11

remedy.
We believe the standing holding of the Eighth

12

13

Circuit is plainly wrong.

QUESTION:

We begin from --

Mr. Gold, what is the actual injury

to the union?

16

MR. GOLD:

The --

17

QUESTION:

The failure to get the notice?

18

MR. GOLD:

Right, the violation of its right to

19

get the notice -QUESTION:

20
21

Well, how does giving a recovery to

the employees redress that injury to the union?
MR. GOLD:

22

The nature of the notice right is not

23

one which inures to the union as an institution, as a

24

person.

25

we quote this on page 10 of our reply brief, is that as

The point of the act, as the sponsors noted, and

1

the collective bargaining agent, the exclusive

2

representative, whether it be an international union, a

3

regional union, or a local union, has the responsibility

4

and authority to address changes in terms and conditions

5

of employment, the effects of a plant closing, and

6

cooperative efforts at worker readjustment.

7

So the union gets the notice in order to

8

facilitate employee readjustment, retraining, job

9

location, to deal with the employer in ways which may even

10

alleviate the entire problem, and as -- what Congress saw

11

is that if the employer does not provide the notice, the

12

union is harmed by losing the opportunity to provide those

13

representative services.

14

And what Congress determined was that where the

15

notice isn't provided, and where employees do not get the

16

opportunity to have this period of readjustment with

17

assured income, the closest that was appropriate, because

18

Congress particularly made the judgment that injunctive

19

relief would not lie, that the closest: that was

20

appropriate was, in essence, a form of specific

21

performance.

22

at some point, and have the opportunity, some opportunity

23

for readjustment in that way.

24
25

You will get 60 days with this assured money

So the union, by providing the substitute, is
redressing the injury that it suffered by this invasion of

1

its legal right.
Now, certainly we would not have balked, and I

2

3

am certain that we lobbied for institutional direct relief

4

as well, but the proposition that this is not relief that

5

redresses the lost opportunities that are generated by the

6

violation of the union's legal right seems to me to be

7

without substance or reason.

8

this particular form of legal right.

This is a form of redressing

QUESTION:

The damages sought are back pay?

MR. GOLD:

Correct.

They are in an amount of

11

back pay.

They're not exactly back pay as we normally

understand that term.

15

found another job or -- it's a formula.

It's a formula term.

QUESTION:

Liquidated --

17

MR. GOLD:

Liquidated damages or penalties is

18
19

what was referred to.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gold, what is the standard

20

procedure in these cases?

It struck me that if you had

21

joined one worker suing on behalf of herself and others

22

similarly situated, that you would have obviated this

23

problem, and I was wondering, since it appears later

24

several workers came forward to make claims, why that

25

wasn't done from the beginning.

MR. GOLD:

1

I can only say that at the time --

2

this was 1992 -- people who brought the case read the

3

statute and proceeded in the way that they believed was

4

right.

5

I think one of the reasons Congress did what it

6

did is that for people who are thrown out in the job

7

market, and so on, to be the named plaintiff in this kind

8

of suit is something of a burden.

9

certain disinclination among individuals to do that, and

10

11

You're going to get a

this was a purposely simplified approach.
I quite agree that you could, and maybe, in the

12

fullness of hindsight, might wish to do a belt and

13

suspenders approach, and both have the union sue and have

14

an individual sue as an aggrieved employee and as a class

15

representative.

16

That's going to complicate the proceedings some,

17

and I can only say that we don't believe it is what

18

Congress required here, any more than it would be required

19

where a union brings a suit of comparable character under

20

a collective bargaining agreement.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Gold, you're in one different

22

position here, I suppose, from the CBA situation, because

23

you're union is in effect a statutory .representative, so

24

the fact that you don't have a union member as a party

25

doesn't really prevent you from arguing that this is

1

2

essentially a class action.
And while it's true, I suppose, that because

3

there's no union member who's a party, there's no one

4

who's a named plaintiff who is going to get damages, but I

5

don't know that that's an Article III problem, so you can

6

still argue that it's like a class action.

7

MR. GOLD:

Oh, absolutely.

I mean, we believe

8

that in this kind of case, as in a case like EOC and

9

General Telephone, you have the union acting for and on

10
11
12

13

behalf of these individuals.
QUESTION:

Isn't that the easy way, in effect,

for us to decide this case, or the easiest, you might say?
MR. GOLD:

We believe that this is a direct

14

standing case.

15

of discussing whether this is a true class action in

16

Rule 23 terms.

17
18

I don't know whether -- I'm on the verge

QUESTION:

Well, we know it's not absolutely

like it, but we're worried about Article III here, and --

19

MR. GOLD:

Right.

20

QUESTION:

And it's, the analogy is, I suppose,

21

close enough for you to say it's, for Article III purposes

22

you ought to treat it just like a class action.

23

MR. GOLD:

Absolutely.

I mean, our overall

24

point in meeting the arguments of the Eighth Circuit is

25

that there is a range of representative litigation of this

kind that situations of a pure association member kind is

2

only one example, and that this, like the collective

3

bargaining contract situation, or the third party

4

beneficiary situation, is a different form of

5

representative or -QUESTION:

6

Mr. Gold, do you think the reasoning

7

of the Eighth Circuit was that, conceding that Congress

8

has authorized this, it violates Article III to authorize

9

it, or simply that it was not clear that Congress had

10

authorized it?
MR. GOLD:

11

No,

I -- we understand the Eighth

12

Circuit to have said that Congress couldn't proceed this

13

way.

14

and the union right, as the statute plainly does, that the

15

union had the right to bring suit, but that the union

16

didn't have standing to seek the only remedy for the

17

violation of this legal right that Congress had created.

18

They said that Congress formulated the employer duty

QUESTION:

Mr. Gold, why is the injury in this

case the failure to give notice?

21

would have been no problem, I assume, right?

Had there been a failure

It seems to me the injury is the closing of the

beforehand?

MR. GOLD:

Well, there is --

2

QUESTION:

You see, I have a sort of instinctive

3

resistance to the notion that you can create purely

4

abstract procedural rights, like the right of everybody in

5

the world, or the right of a particular union to "notice"

6

without any substance behind the notice.

7

What I see to be the violation, here, is not the

8

failure to give the notice but the closing of the plant.

9

That's what hurt people, isn't it?
MR. GOLD:

10

It is the conjunction.

Employers

11

have no duty to give notice unless they're closing or

12

engaging in a mass layoff.

13

This is not an abstract situation.

I agree with

If the employer never closes the plant there's no

QUESTION:

So you have no objection to my

17

considering the injury in this case to be not the failure

18

to receive notice but the closing of the plant, without

19

having done that beforehand, of course.

20

MR. GOLD:

Right.

21

QUESTION:

Oh, but it's both,

22

MR. GOLD:

Yes.

I take it.

I was going to say, in

conjunction, the -- there is no obligation under this

QUESTION:

Let me ask another question.

4

MR. GOLD:

Yes .

5

QUESTION:

If you want us to pursue the theory

6

that Justice Souter was asking you about of

7

representational capacity on the part of a union,

8

again, my problem is I'm reluctant to acknowledge that for

9

Article III purposes Congress can make anybody the

I'm --

10

representative of anybody else and just say, you know,

11

purposes of vindicating this right, you know, John Doe

12

shall have standing to sue.

for

Most of the representational cases I know

13
14

involve a plaintiff who is incapable of suing,

or his trustee.

16

MR. GOLD:

Well, but in the trustee situation --

QUESTION:

The trustee owns the property.

18

MR. GOLD:

All right, but --

19

QUESTION:

-- so the person really interested

MR. GOLD:

The beneficiaries aren't incapable,

20
21

can't sue

Congress took very much into account.

A union, as such, cannot bring

It has some

7

MR. GOLD:

Right.

8

QUESTION:

-- representational existence.

9

MR. GOLD:

Right, and it has -- one of its

10

representational existences is to negotiate collective

11

bargaining agreements and bring suits like this, if there

12

is a breach, to collect back pay and other remedies for

13

the individuals.

14

The notice runs to the union, as the passage I

15

indicated to you indicates, so that the union can carry

16

out these representational functions, so you're well into

17

the central area of the kind of representative that

18

Congress certainly can authorize to bring this kind of

19

lawsuit.

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Gold, you don't concede, do you,

21

that in the associational standing cases the members of

22

the association are incapable of suing?

QUESTION:

-- union members here.

MR. GOLD:

to be for people who are incapable.
QUESTION:

10

What do you make of the argument that

to determine the compensation the employees must come into
this lawsuit as individuals?
MR. GOLD:

11

I don't think that -- first of all,

12

Congress purposely simplified the remedy here so that it

13

is according to a formula and based on back pay.

Beyond that, I don't believe that the

15

individuals have to come in in order to perfect their

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

MR. JENKINS:

1

please the Court:
Petitioner has standing to sue under the WARN

2

3

act both in its own right and as a representative of

4

terminated employees.

5

there's no dispute that Congress, through the WARN act,

6

imposed a legal duty on respondent to give petitioner 60

7

days' notice of the shutdown of the Dixon plant.

8

Petitioner has alleged a breach of that legal duty and, in

9

doing so, has established a direct and personal injury to

10

11

Under direct standing principles,

itself.
That injury is neither hypothetical nor

12

speculative.

This is not a case in which an abstract

13

violation occurs and anyone in the universe has standing

14

or even a cause of action to challenge it.

15

situation where the union itself was denied the notice

16

that it has a right to under the statute.

MR. JENKINS:

QUESTION:

This is a

But Mr. Jenkins -Pardon me.

-- it does seem that the remedy

20

granted is not particularly designed to redress the

21

union's injury, if it's back pay for all the members.

22

MR. JENKINS:

We think it is, Mr. Chief Justice.

23

Congress provided unions right to notice precisely in

24

order to facilitate their role in the readjustment and

25

retraining process.

That process -- pardon me, that role

1

is frustrated by the lack of notice, and it's vindicated

2

by an award of back pay to injured employees.
QUESTION:

3

Well, why is that?

I mean,

4

ordinarily you think if the party who is wronged by -- the

5

union in this case, wronged, as you say, by the lack of

6

notice, that the damages ought to be measured by what harm

7

that is done the union, rather than what harm is done its

8

members.

9

MR. JENKINS:

We think that's correct, but the

10

nature of the injury in this instance is a harm, a

11

frustration of the union's ability to participate in its

12

statutory role and in its organizational role, to

13

participate both in the retraining and readjustment

14

process which Congress found notice to be relevant to, and

15

its ability to function as a collective bargaining

16

representative under the labor laws.

17

QUESTION:

Yes, but these damages are not going

18

to affect that in this -- in a given case.

19

aren't you reduced to saying that the sense in which there

20

is a vindication of the union's right by giving damages to

21

employees is essentially on a deterrence theory, that if

22

you give the damages to the employees in this case, the

23

next employer is going to know it, and is going to give

24

the notice?

25

Don't --

Isn't that as close as you can come to a

1

vindication of the union's interest in receiving the

2

notice?
MR. JENKINS:

3

I don't think so, although I do

4

think that deterrence is certainly one of the goals that

5

Congress had in mind.
But I think in this instance, for example --a

6

7

union doesn't receive notice.

The plant shuts down.

8

Damages to the union would not speak to the union's role

9

in aiding the employees that it represents in the work

10

place, nor would an injunction reopening a plant years

11

after it's closed, even if that were feasible, speak

12

directly to the union's lost opportunities and lost

3

ability to speak to the financial stability of the

4

employees that are represented.
QUESTION:

5

What would speak to it would be an

6

injunction against the plant closing, and that is

7

specifically what Congress withheld.

8
9

MR. JENKINS:

Well, but it -- that would be one

remedy that would speak to that harm, but under

20

Article III the requirement is simply that the remedy

21

sought be likely to redress the injury, not that it

22

necessarily be the best remedy to redress that.

23

QUESTION:

No, but the injury, as I understand

24

it,

is the injury to the union in depriving it of a

25

capacity either to negotiate about the actual decision to

1

close, or to retain those who are going to be put out of

2

work, and the only -- I should think the only remedy that

3

is going to redress or vindicate the union's interest in

4

failing to receive the notice would be a remedy that gives

5

them the statutory amount of time to do that, and that

6

remedy would be an injunction against closing the plant

7

short of 60 days for the union to do whatever it wants to

8

do.

9

The union absolutely cannot get that, so aren't

11

keep saying this -- vindication of the union's interest as

12

such simply cannot be given without an injunction unless

13

you in effect take a long-term deterrence analysis and

14

say, well, if it -- if the union can make it hurt this

15

time by getting damages for a third party, the next

16

employer won't do it?

17

MR. JENKINS:

I -- Justice Souter, I don't think

18

that's the only way to tie this right to the remedy that's

19

imposed.

20

The Congress recognized that terminated

21

employees are much better able to participate, work with

22

unions and other resources for retraining and job

23

adjustment, if they have the financial stability to do so

24

and, of course, that makes sense, that if someone's

25

receiving a paycheck, they can go out, obtain additional

greatly facilitated.

It's much

But they don't -- as a practical

matter, they don't get the money during the time in which

they would want to be doing this, do they?

MR. JENKINS:

Well, no, Your Honor, but I think

for many employees --

QUESTION:

You're talking -- you're making a

10

very practical argument.

11

is getting the paycheck can afford, in at least two

12

senses, to go to school and do the -- and get the

13

retraining, but in fact the employee is not going to get

14

the paycheck until some period considerably down the road

15

when the lawsuit finally grinds to an end, isn't it?

16

MR. JENKINS:

You're saying the employee who

Well, I don't think so, Your

17

Honor.

18

WARN act is aimed in particular at large-scale layoffs in

19

communities that are dependent upon particular industries,

20

and so those employees will still be around, and the union

21

will still have the ability, as will the State dislocated

22

worker unit and the unit of local government, which also

23

have a right to notice under the statute, will have the

24

ability to work with those employees.

Certainly temporally that's true, but I think the

1

So you're saying it may take a long

2

time to get the money, but it's going to take a long time

3

to retrain and get another job.

MR. JENKINS:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. JENKINS:

7

QUESTION:

I think that's right, Your Honor.

So that they ultimately can match.
I think that's right.

Isn't the consequence of that

8

argument that any organization which has the interest of

9

others at heart can be given standing to sue for injuries

10

to those others, because, after all, that's the

11

organization's function?

12

MR. JENKINS:

13

QUESTION:

I don't --

So I suppose the American Civil

14

Liberties Union could be given standing to sue for any

15

deprivation of civil liberties to anyone in the country,

16

because their whole ratiocination is to serve those people

17

and prevent those injuries.
MR. JENKINS:

18
19

I don't think so, Justice Scalia,

for two reasons.

20

QUESTION:

Well, why is this different?

21

MR. JENKINS:

The first reason is that unions

22

are unique in that they have a right to notice under the

23

statute.

24

don't have a statutory right to notice.

25

have the statutory relationship.

QUESTION:

Well, yes, but that's just to say

that Congress has created it here, and I'm saying Congress

could also create it for the ACLU.

MR. JENKINS:

would still be a --

6

QUESTION:

7
8

9

Well, that's correct.

Then there

So what's your other argument?

Why

else is it different?
MR. JENKINS:

There would still be a requirement

under Article III that there be a tangible effect on the

10

plaintiff through the union of the layoff.

A simple

11

ideological disagreement with an abstract violation of law

12

doesn't satisfy Article III.

3

QUESTION:

Well, the tangible effect here was

4

that it was unable to provide the kind of assistance to

5

the people served that it wanted to, right?

6

MR. JENKINS:

That's correct, but this Court has

7

frequently recognized that that type of impairment of an

8

organization's ability to carry out its functions not

9

simply a disagreement or an ideological conflict with

20

action taken is sufficient to provide an injury in fact

21

for Article III purposes.

Yes, but the remedy given is not the

remedy of providing the people what the people are

entitled to.

MR. JENKINS:

1

2

Well, that's correct, Justice

Scalia.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Jenkins, is it relevant to this

4

inquiry that the union is not stepping forward as a union?

5

It has standing under this statute only as exclusive

6

bargaining agent of the employees, isn't that so?

7

MR. JENKINS:

Well, I don't think that's

8

entirely so, Justice Ginsburg.

9

union has its own independent injury.
QUESTION:

10

I think it's true that the

I thought that the workers get the

11

notice, personally, when the union is not representing the

12

plan.

13

MR. JENKINS: _ That's correct.

14

QUESTION:

But when the union is, that only the

15

union is entitled to notice under the statute and the

16

workers aren't.

17

MR. JENKINS:

18

QUESTION:

That's correct.

But does that distinguish the

19

situation of the union that has this preexisting

20

representational obligation from an organization that is

21

merely a do-good agency?
MR. JENKINS:

22

We think certainly so, and that

23

was my point in saying that there's a right to notice

24

here, and as you pointed out, it's an exclusive right to

notice.

It would not be sufficient for respondent to have

The notice goes directly to the

QUESTION:

The

It would seem odd that if notice were

also required to the employees that you would have a
weaker case.

11

MR. JENKINS:

12

QUESTION:

I'm not sure that I follow --

Well, you said one of the reasons the

13

union has standing here is because the union is the only

14

one to get notice, and I observed it would be a rather odd

15

statutory scheme if the notice also went to the employees

16

that you would then have a weaker representational

17

argument.

18

MR. JENKINS:

Well, perhaps it would be weaker

19

in that narrow respect.

20

standing would be lacking as long as a union has a legal

21

right that's been breached, and there are practical

22

consequences of that right, and in addition the union has

23

been affected in a way that distinguishes it from the

24

public at large.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. WALSH

17

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18
19
20

Here,

MR. WALSH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
On a number of occasions in the past 20 or 30

21

years this Court has reiterated what it has called the

22

irreducible constitutional minima for standing to sue in

23

the Federal courts, and two of those minimal requirements

24

are involved in this case, in our opinion.

25

The first, of course, is injury in fact.
23

this

1

Court's cases require that the injury claimed by the

2

plaintiff be concrete, real, immediate, palpable, not

3

speculative, not conjectural, not abstract, and that

4

injury must be to a legally protectable interest.

5

The second element that's involved in this case

6

is that of redressability, which requires that relief from

7

the injury must be likely to follow for the plaintiff from

8

a favorable decision, and it must redress the injury to

9

the complaining party even though the judgment may benefit

10
11

others collaterally.
QUESTION:

What's the relationship between that

12

requirement and our associational standing cases, because

13

in the associational standing cases, the association

14

doesn't necessarily get any relief.

15

Does that -- is the consequence of that that the

16

relationship between redressability and redressability to

17

the named plaintiff is not an Article III requirement?

18

MR. WALSH:

No.

It's movers that do.

In the associational standing

19

cases, and that's the Hunt v. Washington Applegrowers line

20

of cases, the requirement is that an association, in order

21

to sue on behalf of its members, must show three things,

22

first that some of its members have injury; second, that

23

the lawsuit is germane to the association's interests; and

24

thirdly, that the participation of the individuals is not

25

required for complete adjudication.

Now --

Right, but none of those requirements

say that there has got to be a redress flowing directly to

the association.

5

MR. WALSH:

Well, the law has been universal

that an association cannot sue for damages to its members.

7

Not that -- there's no requirement that

QUESTION:

Well, I don't think there is a case

in which they have done so.

9

MR. WALSH:
QUESTION:

10

Correct.
But in the cases in which there has

11

been equitable relief, the benefit of the equitable relief

12

has always been for the members of the association, hasn't

3
4

it?
MR. WALSH:

Well, it's been for both, I think,

5

Justice Souter.

6

declaratory or equitable relief in an associational

7

context, I think the analysis is that that is a communal

8

type of relief which redresses what's deemed to be a

9

collective injury, so there is injury of the members

20
21

I think when you're talking about

that's attributed to the organization, and therefore -QUESTION:

But the organization without that

22

attribution does not, in fact, have an interest which

23

would be vindicated if it alone sued.

was, walked into court and said, we are not representing

Applegrowers, Inc., or whatever they were called -- there

3

wouldn't have been any relief that they would have been

entitled to, I suppose.

MR. WALSH:

Well, in that case actually they did

have an interest because they claimed that they were

losing -- they would lose dues if the --

QUESTION:

9

MR. WALSH:

Oh, they were reaching in --- said statute were not overturned.

But they could not walk in and say, we are suing

10

11

on behalf of our members for their lost profits, for

12

instance, or their damages, and that's the disconnect --

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. WALSH:

15

QUESTION:

Well, they never have.

I mean, we --

That's correct.
-- haven't held that they couldn't,

never have.

QUESTION:

I don't understand why it wouldn't

MR. WALSH:

Yes.

It depends on the relief being

sought.

I mean, doesn't the one follow from the other?
MR. WALSH:

3

I don't think so.

When you're

4

talking about damages, Justice Scalia, you can't have the

collective type of analysis that you have when you're

6

talking about injunctive relief, that all together there,

everybody's suffering the same wrong.

8

the organization by reason of it happening to the members,

9

but when it's damages, it's clearly -QUESTION:

10

It's attributed to

The wrong can be a very

11

individualized wrong that the injunction is addressed

against, for example, not paying a certain level of wages,

entitled to.

15

that additional --

You get a mandatory injunction requiring

MR. WALSH:

Well, if that were the case, that

each union or association member were entitled to a

same kind of problem with that as you would with a damage

2

That isn't what the members are saying, so you

3

can't say that the -- I don't think you can properly say

4

that the analysis depends upon everyone suffering the same

5

wrong and hence everyone, association and members, getting

6

the same benefit from the injunction and, therefore, if it

7

makes sense to say that they have a kind of representative

standing, then that representative standing depends upon

9

their asserting something that the association itself

10

could not or would not assert.

11

MR. WALSH:

12

in Brock again, the ability --

13

QUESTION:

Well, as the Court said in Warth and

Let me -- well, I want to be sure,

14

but just on the terms that I just gave you, doesn't it

15

follow that you can't make the argument that they are all

16

in the same boat?

17

MR. WALSH:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. WALSH:

That's probably true.
Okay.
But where they are close enough to

20

being in the same boat that the relief sought will remedy

21

the communal wrong, that's the rationale for allowing

22

associational injunctive cases and for disallowing damage

23

cases, and --

act, isn't it, is to give the union, just as Mr. Gold

2

said, notice so it has some time to arrange for the

3

employees to get training or other benefits?

4

It lost that time.

It failed in its duty to the

5

employees because they didn't get notice.

6

it can get money for them.

7

Well, at least

I mean, isn't that something that unions are

8

there for, to help the employees by getting them money, by

9

getting them training, by getting other things, and a

10

failure to get notice inhibits that obligation of the

11

union, which is what its purpose is.

12

Why can't Congress under the -- what in the

13

Constitution prevents Congress from saying -- Congress

14

wants to say we'll restore the union not completely, but

15

we'll restore the union roughly to where it might have

16

been, not by giving the employees training, we can't, but

17

at least we'll give them some extra money?

Where in the Constitution does it say that
Congress can't make that judgment?

there's no evidence anywhere that Congress made such a --

come in, sue when it doesn't get notice, and collect

2

liquidated damages in an amount equal to the number of

3

days times the average wage, which presumably it pays to

the workers, so the workers then think, well -- I don't

5

know, does it pay it to the workers or not?

6

Maybe it just -- I don't know what happens to

7

it, but I think the workers might feel better about it if

8

the union has it rather than the employer.

9

(Laughter. )

10

MR. WALSH:

There is nothing either in the

11

legislative history or in the statute itself which

12

suggests that that is the so-called injury that's being

13

redressed.

QUESTION:

Oh, well then --

the individuals.
Now, that, to me, means the check that we would

have to cut if we lost would be payable to the individuals

5

probably, but the union also on the check.

In that respect it would be no

7

different than if one employee had stepped forward and

The statute does contemplate class

actions, Justice Ginsburg.

MR. WALSH:

But -But I don't think that could apply

3

to the damage part of the case for the same reasons that

4

we've discussed -QUESTION:

5

The question I was trying to ask is,

6

why isn't the remedy aimed at redressing a real harm to

7

the union, namely, its inability to help its workers by

8

arranging for some interim relief for the workers?

9

What this does is, it gives the workers some

20

money.

That isn't precisely what the union would have

21

arranged for, though it might have done.

22

roughly the kind of benefit the union could have arranged

23

for, so the statute says, pay them that.

what I read the statute as doing, irrespective of the

statute's motive.

At least that's

All I'm looking for is, is that helping a little

2

bit to redress a harm, and my question is under the

3

Constitution, why doesn't that help redress somewhat a

4

harm that the union really suffered?

5

MR. WALSH:

Well, because first of all, with all

6

due respect, Justice Breyer, there's nothing in the

7

statute that suggests that that's the injury that's being

8

redressed.

9
10

11
12

There are two other statutes that were enacted
at approximately the same - QUESTION:

The injury that is being redressed is

the failure to get notice.

13

MR. WALSH:

14

Now, there's another statute which requires

The lack of notice to the union.

15

notice to the local job partnership, the State job

16

partnership, and there's a statute that says that that's

17

the organization that is supposed to bring the parties

18

together once the plant closing is announced.

19

It's supposed to notify the union within 48

20

hours of it being notified, so even if the union didn't

21

get notice here, it's required to get notice under that

22

statute, and that's the one that determines all these

rights and remedies that the union's talking about here,

the relocation.

And that's been effectively overruled

by later cases, which say its purpose is not to assure

MR. WALSH:

That's correct, yes, Your Honor.

15

The union has repeatedly based its claim here on

16

the fact that Congress has acted and Congress has the

17

right to create standing.

18

Now, Congress, indeed, has the right to create

19

capacity to sue, but the party seeking the review must

20

still be among the injured, and as Justice Kennedy said in

21

his concurring opinion in Lujan, Congress at very least

must identify the injury it seeks to vindicate and relate

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Your time has expired.

MR. GOLD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

16

In terms of the Article III point that Justice

17

Souter was pursuing, the Court has decided the General

18

Telephone case, -the Alamo case where the Government sues

19

to enforce a public right and to get individual payments

20

to people who were harmed.

If this was an Article III question, title VII,

22

the Fair Labor Standards Act, as well as section 301 would

23

all be beyond the Court's powers.
