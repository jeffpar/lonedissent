ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. O'REILLY, III

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. O'REILLY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Some 8 years ago we started what I thought was a

12

run-of-the-mill, garden-variety type labor dispute which

13

has grown and grown, and here we are.

14

In the course of a collective bargaining

15

dispute, the -- a strike arose; picketing took place.

16

Immediately during the course of this garden-variety

17

dispute, 40 percent of the employees, the bargaining unit,

18

crossed the line, the same 40 percent which, it's a small

19

unit, that 40 percent is only 9 employees, were bad-

20

mouthing the union.

21

The employer, during the course of this 5- or

22

6-week strike, obtained the belief that because of the 40

23

percent the union did not have the tremendously strong

24

percentage of support, and it shot across the bow of the

25

union bargaining position a rather extreme shot.

It

beefed up its contract proposal.

2

However, the significant point, when it beefed

3

it up, it did not have, then, reason to believe that the

4

union was not a majority representative.

5

reason -- in fact, the -- it would -- to believe that the

6

union still maintained its majority status, but it shot

7

this across the bow of the union, this beefed-up union

8

proposal, and at that time the negotiations are broken

9

off.

It had every

The very next day, the union abandoned the

10
11

picket line, the pickets went down, and a number of

12

extraordinary events took place over the next 3 business

13

days.

14

Everyone -- almost everyone came back to work.
Of those who came back to work, a number of them

15

did the same as their predecessors, the 40 percent who

16

had come back earlier, had crossed the picket line, were

17

knocking the union, being very critical of the union.

18

In fact, four additional employees resigned from

19

the union after they came back, spoke to company

20

representatives and said, we don't need the union, I don't

21

know why we wanted a union in the first place.

22

these individuals who were thus bad-mouthing the union had

23

been picketing that Friday morning.

24

were in saying to the company, ah, we never needed a union

25

here in the first place.

QUESTION:

Mr.

-- Krischer,

is it?

Excuse me,

Mr. O'Reilly --

3

MR. O'REILLY:

4

QUESTION:

O'Reilly.

Are you making any claim here that

5

the union in fact lacked majority support at the time the

6

union accepted the offer?

7

MR. O'REILLY:

Justice O'Connor,

I have been

8

making that claim not only today but for the last 8 years.

9

I know the issue has been raised in respondent's --

QUESTION:

Is that issue in front of us, do you

think, properly?
MR. O'REILLY:
particularly,

I believe it is, Your Honor,

I --

QUESTION:

Did the board deal with the case in

15

that posture, or not?

16

before us a - - the issue of whether there was a good faith

17

doubt, not whether there was in fact lack of support.

18

I somehow thought that we had

MR. O'REILLY:

Justice O'Connor,

I believe you

19

have both issues before you.

20

indicate -- for instance,

21

sent eventually,

22

telegram said we have reason to believe that the union no

23

longer represents a majority.

QUESTION:

the case that are not before us.

is whether an employer is bound by a union's acceptance of

2

an earlier proposal for a collective - - when at the time

3

of the union's -- the employer had a reasonable basis for

4

a good-faith doubt of the union's continued majority

status.
MR. O'REILLY:

10
11

That is correct, Mr. Chief

Justice.
QUESTION:

I don't see that as raising the

question in fact as to whether the union had lost its
majority status.
MR. O'REILLY:

Well, of course, in fact that

12

was -- Mr. Chief Justice, that was raised in our original

13

answer to the complaint 8 years ago at the labor board.

14

We also used the phrase, good faith doubt, and the reason

15

we did is because it's easier for an employer to defend

16

and to prove its defense by -- through circumstantial

17

evidence of creating a good faith doubt, but we did --

18

QUESTION:

Well, the issues are quite different,

19

possibly, and I wonder if we aren't bound by how the

20

question is presented in your petition for certiorari.

21

MR. O'REILLY:

I think the issues may vary, but

22

I - - in this particular case I think they're so closely

23

intertwined that they can be treated as one and the same.

24
25

For instance, the court of appeals, who heard -of the First Circuit heard this case twice, and both in

1

their first decision, as well as in their second decision,

2

they treated it, notwithstanding the original issue having

3

been framed as a good faith doubt case, they treated it in

4

both decisions as a question of the employer attempting to

5

prove before the administrative law judge and before the

6

National Labor Relations Board that in fact the union had

7

lost its majority status.
QUESTION:

8

And is that the board rule, that even

if you were to show unquestionably, never mind good faith
10

doubt, that the union no longer had majority status, that

11

the same result would ensue?
MR. O'REILLY:

12

No, I think the only difference,

13

Justice Scalia, would be if we, the employer, had raised

14

and proved -- established at the trial level that we had a

15

good faith doubt, it would then be incumbent upon general

16

counsel to establish that in fact the union had maintained

17

a maj ority - QUESTION:

18

But I'm asking you what the board

1

rule is.

20

of a good faith doubt, nor even the establishment of

21

actual nonmajority status will suffice to get you out of

22

the contract here?

23

Is the board rule that neither the establishment

MR. O'REILLY:

No, as I understand the board

25

position that if we had established under the facts of

QUESTION:

MR. O'REILLY:

The board has reserved in this

whether or not the actual loss of majority would have

entitled us, under the facts of this case, to send -- fire

So it is a separate question, then,

and - MR. O'REILLY:

I suspect it is, but we feel the

result would be the same under both scenarios.
QUESTION:

Mr. O'Reilly, would you --my

18

understanding was that your friends at the AFL-CIO took

19

the position, but there's only one way to establish that

20

the union has lost its majority, and that is through a

21

secret ballot.

22

MR. O'REILLY:

They -- Justice Ginsburg, they

23

took the same position, of course, and filed an almost

24

identical brief in the Curtin Matheson case, saying that

over the years, the board rule that a good faith doubt

entitles you to withdraw your recognition of the union,

3

they took the position in that case and in the amicus in

And they also said in their brief

that general counsel had recommended such a position to
the board.

MR. O'REILLY:

QUESTION:

13

MR. O'REILLY:

Well --

Where does that stand, do you know?
My understanding, I've had an

14

opportunity to look into that.

15

only reflect was I was told by the employer's counsel in

16

that case, that the -- and there is a board decision some

17

3 years ago in that case.

19

requested that it be referred back to the board.

I contacted -- and I can

It was on appeal to the

in that case was conducted a year and a half ago, and no

QUESTION:

I

don't want to say it doesn't matter to you.
MR. O'REILLY:

But I'm not sure what the

7

likelihood is of the board adopting that particular view

8

of the scenario I just described.
This case was decided within the last year.

13

meantime and at least, certainly in this case, deny it.

14

The board certainly would have had an

QUESTION:

But if you -- we -- you are going in

15

this case on the proposition that there's a reasonable

16

doubt rule, so that the question is, at what point can the

17

employer -- it's really a timing question.

18

reasonable doubt -- I think you're agreed, are you not,

19

that if you had withdrawn the offer on the 18th or 19th on

20

the basis of your good faith doubt, there would be no

21

contract that they could accept.

22

23
24
25

MR. O'REILLY:

I think the

There would be nothing out there

for them to accept, is correct.
QUESTION:

So why can't the board say, we have

to draw the line some place, we're going to draw it at the

1

2

union's acceptance of the contract?
MR. O'REILLY:

Well, of course, the board is

3

apparently adopting this bright line theory that it's a

4

lot easier to administer the act if we have a specific

5

date, and obviously, I don't have a problem with that

6

concept, but what I'm just saying is the specific date

7

that they have picked, the bright line rule in this case,

8

there is no logical basis for it.

9

The logical basis apparently is that sending a

10

Sunday evening telegram somehow transforms a union that

11

the employer had every reason to then believe had a good

12

faith doubt as to its majority status, somehow this

13

telegram, Sunday evening telegram, transforms that

14

apparently minority union into a majority union.

15
16

QUESTION:

I take it that their basis is not a

telegram, their basis is a contract, all right.

MR. O'REILLY:

QUESTION:

MR. O'REILLY:

So once the contract is created -Created by --

-- you can't question it for the

period of the contract bar.

MR. O'REILLY:

QUESTION:

Yes.

And it doesn't -- I mean, what is

24

illogical about saying there's a contract bar, it starts

25

when the contract was created?

1

MR. O'REILLY:

2

QUESTION:

If

If you have a complaint about the

3

union, make it before the contract is -- after, you're

4

barred.

That's the contract bar, right.

5

MR. O'REILLY:

6

QUESTION:

And that's --

And that, as I understand it, is the

7

rule, and why is that illogical?

8

MR. O'REILLY:

9

theory.

And that's their bright line

I think the illogical argument comes into play

10

this way, Justice Breyer.

We have an obligation, as an

11

employer dealing with any union, at all times to see to it

12

to investigate, to analyze what is the status of this

13

union?

14

Obviously, if it's a minority union, does not represent a

15

majority of employees, it's illegal under the statute for

16

us to

Is it a majority union, or is it a minority union?

17

QUESTION:

Is that right, even though it's been

18

certified?

19

with a properly certified union?

20

Can you be subjected to liability for dealing

MR. O'REILLY:

Yes, Your Honor, at least beyond

21

the -- this is -- the certification in this case, and of

22

course, none of the employees who were involved in that

23

certification process are still employed by the company,

24

but the certification in that case was in the 1970's, as I

25

recall, so you have -- you could deal with -- the board

1

principle is that once it's certified there is an

2

irrebuttable presumption no matter what happens to the

3

majority status for a 1-year period.

4

QUESTION:

For 1 year.

5

MR. O'REILLY:

So even though you know, as a

6

matter of moral certainty, that the union has lost its

7

majority status during that year, not only is it not

8

illegal to deal with them, you have to deal with them.

9

QUESTION:

But that gets us back to Justice

10

Breyer's question that I don't think you fully answered.

11

The point was, why not make the contract bar rule become

12

effective upon the acceptance of a contract?

13

contracts are accepted, we know when they're not.

14

make that the bright line rule?

15

MR. O'REILLY:

We know when
Why not

We suggest, Justice Kennedy, that

16

the employer should have an opportunity, when it is coming

17

across a crescendo of events that happened in this case

18

during this 3-day period, should have an opportunity to

19

analyze, review those events, to see whether in fact it is

20

dealing with a majority or a minority union, and in this

21

case we suggest that it didn't have.

But you could have done that by

in this case, Your Honor --

MR. O'REILLY:

4

You wish you had done it.
I would -- I certainly wish I had

done it

5

QUESTION:

No, but I mean, you could --

6

MR. O'REILLY:

-- and now the world knows that

7

that's probably the best way to do it, but unfortunately

8

that does not advance productive negotiations, where any
time you have a question in your own mind --

10

QUESTION:

Well, when the point comes that

11

you're questioning the union's continuing capacity as a

12

representative, there's going to be a certain chill upon

13

the proceedings anyway.

14

MR. O'REILLY:

15

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

You've got to accept that, and I

16

don't see that the chill is going to be any greater by

17

withdrawing the offer on that ground than it is by doing

18

what you want to do.

MR. O'REILLY:

Well, I'll just take two of the

20

major events, if I may, Your Honor, that led to the

21

employees eventually creating in its own mind the good

faith doubt.

Seven union supporters, including the union

steward, the employer received that information on Friday

afternoon, that hearsay information that these seven are

Now, they

should have an opportunity to review that.

The other information was that - -

QUESTION:

They should

May I just interrupt with one

8

question to be sure I understand correctly?

If you did

9

review it thoroughly and concluded -- and assume the facts

10

are that, even though you had your doubts, that there

11

still was majority support for the union, why is it all

12

unfair?

13

If the other had happened, if you had been able

14

to prove there was not, your doubt was correct, even

15

though they'd accepted the offer you could get out of it,

16

couldn't you?

17
18
19

MR. O'REILLY:

That's correct, Your Honor, as

long as we move quicker than they do.
QUESTION:

If - -

Yes, but even if you didn't move

20

quickly enough, if your doubts had been substantiated by

21

your thorough investigation on Monday and Tuesday, you

22

still would have been protected.

23

MR. O'REILLY:

If -- we would have been

24

protected only if we had withdrawn the offer or withdrawn

25

recognition.

Or if you could prove they did not

MR. O'REILLY:

Our position is, we would be --

4

if at the time of that telegram, and we had the

opportunity to conduct this investigation, even though we

6

had not won that race to the telegraph office, we would be

7

protected, and that's our position in this case, Justice

8

Stevens, that the mere fact that they send a telegram
before we have an opportunity to fire off our

10

withdrawal -- and I'd ask the Court to bear in mind that

this was Thanksgiving week, it was a 3-day week, and

QUESTION:

But in this case, just so I have it

clear in my own mind, did they make a factual

determination one way or another as to whether there

MR. O'REILLY:

QUESTION:

4

MR. O'REILLY:

No.

I see.
No, there was no finding.

The

5

administrative law judge as well as the board said, it's

6

immaterial, we don't have to get into that because at the

7

time the company had an acceptance, therefore the rest of

8

the evidence that was -- and this was a 3-day hearing,

9

most of which dealt with our evidence that we had the

10

basis for a good faith doubt, but the administrative law

11

judge and the board said all of that is immaterial because

12

there was an offer-acceptance and Sunday evening you had a

13

contract, so it's too late to --

14

QUESTION:

Well, the way you describe it, it

15

sounds as though at least the administrative law judge's

16

ruling was that even though you had been able to prove

17

that there was no majority support, it was irrelevant, and

18

yet I understood you to say the board took no position if

19

you could prove that fact.

20

MR. O'REILLY:

The board in its petition, in its

21

brief to this Court has expressly reserved and said that

22

that might be a different consideration but we're not

23

going to get into that, because we feel a good faith doubt

24

case, which they claim this is, is different from a actual

25

loss of majority case, so they are hypothesizing saying it

might be different, but they are not expressly taking that

2

position.
QUESTION:

3

Well, what's the effect of that case

4

from this Court in '61, the International Ladies' Garment

5

Workers Union case, where presumably we held it was an

6

unfair labor practice for an employer to enter a

7

collective bargaining agreement with a union that in fact

lacks majority support?

10

11
12

MR. O'REILLY:

Is that good law as far as you

I think it's excellent law,

Justice O'Connor.
QUESTION:

So do you think it's open to the

13

board to alter that rule or not?

14

MR. O'REILLY:

We would suggest it is not, and I

15

would remind the Court, as I am sure we do not have to,

16

that in that case there was an unknowing violation.

17

employer was under the false impression at the time of

18

entering the agreement it felt the union in fact was a

majority union.

1

MR. O'REILLY:

That's correct, and the ironic

2

aspect of this case is, I find it difficult to reconcile

3

the logic of the ILG which says it's an unfair labor

4

practice even unknowingly to enter into a contract with a

5

minority union, but the --

6

QUESTION:

Mr. O'Reilly, is there something

7

different in a union that has never been certified by the

8

board, which I take it was the ILGWU case, where there's a

9

concern that maybe it's a sweetheart union, and here,

10

where the board was -- the union was certified and had a

11

long-term bargaining relationship with the company?

12

MR. O'REILLY:

There is a possible, or a

13

definite argument, certainly during the 1 year after the

14

certification, that there was a legitimate recognition,

15

but the certification in this case goes back at least a

16

generation, so I think the mere fact that they were

17

certified --

18

QUESTION:

But the employer at any point could

19

have asked for a new election.

MR. O'REILLY:

MR. O'REILLY:

That's -- that's --

saying the contract bar rule is unlawful?

No, Your Honor.

No.

2

QUESTION:

Well, the contract bar rule has to

start somewhere.

3

MR. O'REILLY:

4

QUESTION:

5
6

It's -- has --

So -- and I take it it's up to the

board, basically, to say where it starts.
MR. O'REILLY:

But a contract bar rule would

7

never be based upon an agreement that in turn is an unfair

8

labor practice.

9

When an employer enters into an agreement with a

10

union not maintaining majority status, that contract would

11

not legitimately serve as the basis for a contract bar, so

12

we're saying that if you adopt a contract bar rule by

13

analogy in this case, we are saying that when that

14

telegram was fired off, the union more than likely knew,

15

and we definitely knew, that they didn't maintain a

16

majority status.

17

QUESTION:

But even if they've lost their

18

majority status during the time of the contract, and

19

different people, people come in and say, look, we

20

represent the workers now, junk that, you can't do

21

anything about it.

22

MR. O'REILLY:

23

QUESTION:

That's correct.

So that principle has to start some

24

place, so I want to see what's wrong, what's illogical

25

about starting it?

MR. O'REILLY:

I think you have to focus on when

2

was the collective bargaining agreement that serves as the

3

basis for the -- what was the basis of the offer and

4

acceptance?

5

offer and acceptance that created that contract?

6

What was the status of the parties as of that

We're saying in this case if the status of the

7

union as of the date of that purported acceptance was that

8

the union did not maintain a majority status, there cannot
be a contract, and the implications of a legitimate

10
11

contract do not flow.
A legitimate contract, of course, creates for

12

the -- if it's a 3-year or less contract, for the balance

13

of that collective bargaining there is an irrebuttable

14

presumption that the union, notwithstanding its actual

15

status over the 3 years, there is an irrebuttable

16

presumption that it is maintaining its majority status so

17

as to encourage the parties to deal with each other.

18

We do not have that premise, namely a legitimate

1

majority status, at the time of the inception of this, or

20

conception, I guess, of this agreement.

21

QUESTION:

Have employers ever appended to their

22

offer clause that says, if you accept this offer,

23

execution of the contract will be subject to our

24

determining within 7 days that you continue to have a

25

majority status?

1

MR. O'REILLY:

I have not encountered that type

2

of situation, but this decision, if it is upheld, might

3

encourage the type of appendage to an offer.

4
5
6

QUESTION:

Again --

There would be no bar in labor law

from appending such a clause to an offer.
MR. O'REILLY:

I think the labor board might

7

have a problem with that.

It's one thing to append

8

something such as this contract is only valid for X days,

9

or sundown tonight the offer is withdrawn, but to put

10

something like that onto it might cause some problems at

11

the labor board.

12

QUESTION:

With respect to the board, they did

13

this twice because the First Circuit said the first time

14

it wasn't good enough.

15

to the board's drawing this line where it did and

16

explaining it?

17

MR. O'REILLY:

What deference, if any, do we owe

I think the deference that this

18

Court traditionally gives to labor board decisions is not

19

applicable here.

20

conditioned it, we will defer to the board as long as the

21

board's ruling is rational and consistent with the act.

22

Our position, of course, is, here it's not rational

23

MR. O'REILLY:

of some people in this Court that we are going to call the

First Circuit irrational, but they --

QUESTION:

(Laughter.)

6

From time to time.

MR. O'REILLY:

They did determine, without

7

saying why, really -- of course, they sent it back, you

8

will recall, in the first instance saying that the board's

9

decision really didn't say anything, that cited a few

10

cases having nothing to do with this factual situation,

11

and then after the board finally -- and the Court did

12

create a rather impossible task for the board.

13

It said, all right, take this irrational result

14

and give us a rational basis for it, and I don't blame the

15

board for taking -- and even though the court said do this

16

expeditiously, I don't blame the board for taking 2-1/2

17

years to come up with an attempt to rationalize what I

think is an irrational result.

QUESTION:

I find it difficult to understand how

10

it can possibly be said that the question of whether

11

actual nonmajority status would suffice to avoid the

12

contract bar rule is not in this case.

13

possibly be said that it's not in this case?

MR. O'REILLY:

of mine in the petition for certiorari.

the reasonableness of a rule of the National Labor

2

Relations Board that concerns the timing of an employer's

3

assertion of a good faith doubt a union's majority status.

4

QUESTION:

Well, what would the situation be,

5

Mr. Seamon, if, in fact, there were no majority support at

6

the time the union tried to accept the offer?

7

MR. SEAMON:

Justice O'Connor, the board has not

8

addressed that issue, and it reserves it in this case.

9

would obviously present very different considerations in

It

10

light of decisions such as Ladies' Garment Workers, but we

11

emphasize that at issue in this case is only a claim of a

12

good faith doubt of majority status.

13

QUESTION:

Well, is it possible that if in fact

14

there was no majority support that it would be an unfair

15

labor practice for the employer to enter the contract?

16

MR. SEAMON:

It is possible but I would

17

emphasize that one important difference to which Justice

18

Ginsburg alluded between the present context and Garment

recognized union, whereas the present case involves a

union that was certified by the board.

the same context called Belcon also dealt with a

Emphatically so.

In fact, at every

7

stage of the proceeding where petitioner had an

opportunity to make a claim of an actual loss of majority

MR. SEAMON:

I'm reading from the beginning of

footnote 85, on page 85a.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. SEAMON:

Okay.
We agree with the judge that, under

5

established board precedent, once the board finds that the

6

parties have reached a binding collective bargaining

7

agreement, it is unnecessary to consider the issue of a

8

respondent's alleged good faith doubt of the union's

majority status.

10

I would also refer the Court to page 54a of this

11

same filing, which is from the board's second supplemental

opinion in this case.

On page 55a, the very last sentence

careful, measured statement that it has good faith doubt,

which is a term of art in the labor law, and then you

3

fault him for not saying that he knew.

4

to a very trivial difference, it seems to me.
MR. SEAMON:

5

It really amounts

Well, one of the reasons that the

6

board has developed the good faith doubt rule is the

7

recognition that it can be difficult, in the absence of a

8

decertification, to prove an actual loss of majority

9

status.

10

QUESTION:

And it seems to me that the employer

11

acted quite consistently with the dictates of the labor

12

board and the dictates of the labor law in that regard.

13

MR. SEAMON:

The labor law permitted it to

14

assert a good faith doubt, but it also required it to take

15

other steps to either withdraw its offer and then assert

16

the good faith doubt to petition for an election before

17

the new agreement was entered into by the union's

18

acceptance of its offer.

19

And it shouldn't be lost sight of that the

2

the question of what the result should be if, in fact, the

3

claim was and was proven that there had been a loss of

majority support?

5

Because one of your arguments is there is need

6

to have a bright line rule for the sake of stability and

industrial peace once a contract has been formed, but now

8

I understand the board is saying, well, we reserve the

9

question whether there is such a need if it can be shown

10
11

that the union actually had lost majority support.
So if -- it seems to me that the practical

12

effect of that is going to be that so long as that

13

question is reserved, that any employer with a good faith

14

doubt is going to make in good faith a claim that in fact

majority support was withdrawn --

I --- and there goes the whole need for

the bright line -- or the whole justification based on a

19

bright line argument.

20

MR. SEAMON:

I acknowledge, Justice Souter, that

21

one of the difficulties that would arise from creating a

22

different rule for claims of actual loss of majority

23

status from the rule that applies to good faith doubt

24

claims is that employers would be tempted to circumvent it

25

by a mere point of pleading, to say not only did I have a

good faith doubt, but I also believe that the union in

2

fact lost majority status, and that may, in fact, be a

3

consideration that the board could validly take into

4

account if and when in the future it addresses the

5

question of whether the rule should be different.

6

QUESTION:

But it is --

7

QUESTION:

But that's a question for the board,

8

because isn't there some doubt as to what extent the

9

Government can bind an employee to be represented by a

10

union that in fact does not occupy majority status?
MR. SEAMON:

11

It is a very serious question for

12

the reasons elaborated in the Ladies' Garment Workers

13

decision.

14

decision and this one, but obviously --

Again, there are differences between that

QUESTION:

15

So you're saying that the need for

16

the bright line is still there, but there just may be a

17

circumstance in which, need or no need, we simply cannot

18

have the benefit of it?
MR. SEAMON:

19

That is right, and again, quite

20

apart from the employer's temptation to plead an actual

21

loss of majority status, it is perfectly logical for the

22

board's rule to operate upon the acceptance of the

23

petitioner's outstanding contract offer.

No, but -- may I interrupt you,

And do you -- can you give us any

MR. SEAMON:

Yes.

My brother at the bar

correctly stated the posture of the case right now.

16

under submission before the board following oral argument,

17

which occurred about a year ago, but I would say it's far

from clear whether the board is going to address the

general counsel's argument that the good faith doubt rule

20

should be abandoned.

that particular case, and the general counsel emphasizes

that the board doesn't need to address it at all.

10

MR. SEAMON:

I recognize the AFL-CIO takes the

position that the pendency of Lee Lumber renders the grant

12

of cert improvident.

13

so unclear whether the -- how the board is going to rule

14

and whether it's going to rule that that alone doesn't

weigh against the grant, but by the same token, of course,

16

we wouldn't oppose dismissal on those grounds.

17

QUESTION:

We -- in our judgment, again, it is

The acceptance was a logical point

18

for cutting off consideration of claims of good faith

doubt, because it was that point in this case that ended

20

the strike and restored productivity at the plant, and

21

from the point of view of the National Labor Relations

22

Act, that is an event of central importance.

23

More generally, when unions accept contract

24

offers from employers, that marks a fundamental alteration

25

in the relationship between the parties.

After that

1

point, it is reasonable for the board to require the

2

parties to accept the results of the process and get back

3

to the productive enterprise in which they both have such

4

an important interest.

5

I would also suggest that in any event it is not

6

necessary for the Court in this case to decide whether, in

7

lieu of a bright line, the board should have adopted a

8

rule that would require it to determine in every case

9

whether the employer had a reasonable opportunity to

10

investigate and to voice its good faith doubt, because

11

petitioner did have such an opportunity.
Most or all of the evidence on which it premised

12

13

its good faith doubt was received 6 days before the union

14

accepted petitioner's contract offer, and has arisen

15

earlier in the argument.

At any time, petitioner had the option of

withdrawing its offer.

it break off negotiations and take its offer off the

QUESTION:

It also could have petitioned for

It may ultimately be for the board to

balance, but the rule that it's adopted almost encourages

employers to continue making allegations as to good faith

doubts and disrupting the bargaining process.

me much more sensible to do it post hoc.

It seems to

MR. SEAMON:

1

Well, in many ways the most

2

sensible approach, and the approach that is preferred for

3

purposes of the statute, is for the employer to file a

4

petition for an election, assuming that the employees

5

themselves have not availed themselves of that right.
This Court recognized that in Brooks, and it

6

7

also recognized that the reason for that is that we can

8

justifiably be concerned about employer's attempts to

9

vindicate the rights of employees, especially when the

10

employees themselves have ample opportunity to assert

11

those rights.

12

allowing employees to assert the rights of employees was

13

not conducive to industrial peace, it is inimical to it.

14

The Court in Brooks said, in fact, that

But Mr. Seamon, wouldn't that be a

burden for a small company like this?

employees.

Wouldn't it be an expense?

It is not necessarily a

particularly elaborate procedure, and in this case, of

course, the litigation that ensued was quite as

extraordinary as it would have been had -- as it might

22

have been had the employer taken the preferred route and

23

filed the petition for an election in the first place.

24
25

And it also bears emphasizing that the board's
rule does not permanently foreclose an employer from

QUESTION:

Instead, if the employer

Do the board rules permit this

particular employer to go back and raise the other half of

the claim, or has it lost -- have they lost that?
I mean, I take it initially they thought there

was just going to be one rule, actual good faith the same,

decided.

MR. SEAMON:

QUESTION:

16
17

There's a

Well -Do the board rules permit them to go

back now, or not?
MR. SEAMON:

I'm not certain of the answer to

18

that question, but I would suggest that there's a very

19

good argument that they've waived the argument to the

20

extent that the board made it quite clear in both of its

21

decisions that it considered this case as presenting only

22

a good faith doubt, and petitioner could have sought

23

reconsideration of the board's decision on the grounds

24

that the board had overlooked one of its claims, but it

25

failed to do so.

QUESTION:

1

These events took place in 1988, so

2

it may be a little late to go back and argue about the

3

thing, I suppose.
MR. SEAMON:

4
5

That's right, and I believe the

petitioner in this case had ample opportunity.
It was quite clear -- it's been clear since the

6

7

Celanese Corporation decision in 1951 -- that there are

8

two separate claims that can be used to justify refusal to

9

bargain.

One is a good faith doubt, the other is an

10

actual loss of majority status, so petitioner -- the

11

clarity of the board's precedent can't be blamed for

12

petitioner's failure to raise both claims if it thought

13

both were grounded in the facts.

14

QUESTION:

The board's rule serves the interest

15

in repose for the most part by drawing a bright line after

16

which the parties are required to accept the results of

17

the negotiation process, and it also prevents sandÂ­

18

bagging, which can occur where an employer decides that it

19

is going to keep its doubts regarding the union's majority

20

status to itself during the negotiation process and raise

21

them after an agreement has been concluded if it decides

22

in hindsight that the agreement is not to its liking.

23

We're not suggesting that that was operative

24

here, and that it is a very real concern in the general

25

run of cases.

If I may just briefly, in addition to the

1

2

reference at page 3a, the Court makes identical references

3

on pages 80a, 82a, and in the specific order of remand to

4

the board at page 83a it continuously refers to the issue

5

as being a loss of majority, and it is easy to somehow

6

distinguish, or sometimes confuse the distinguishing

7

factors.
In fact, in this case there is a reference to

the Chicago Tribune, the Seventh Circuit case.

That was a

clear loss of majority case.

11

this Court it says that has nothing to do with that, that

was a loss of majority case, and this is a good faith
