ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM B. MALLIN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11

MR. MALLIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:

12

This is a constitutional case.

It concerns the

13

Seventh Amendment guarantee of the right to jury trial on

14

infringement issues in patent infringement actions for

15

damages.

16

It is established that the Seventh Amendment

17

guarantees the constitutional right to jury trial in civil

18

cases as it existed in 1791 in England.

19

submit that it is decisive here that in England in 1791

20

the meaning of the terms of patents,

21

specifications were submitted to the jury.

22

Accordingly, we

century and Judge Learned Hand in the mid-20th century.
QUESTION:

3

I had a little trouble finding that

4

confirmation that you seem to have found.

5

Hand's opinion seemed ambiguous and it also certainly says

6

that in the part that favors you, that it's a question of

7

fact.

MR. MALLIN:

QUESTION:

10

I mean, Judge

Yes.
All right.

So, where does that get

us?

11

MR. MALLIN:

It -- Judge Hand indicates that the

12

issue is a question of fact.

13

QUESTION:

I have no doubt about that, but where

14

does -- the question of how people in a particular

15

industry see a particular word and interpret it is a

16

linguistic question.

17

they interpret it.

18

MR. MALLIN:

Yes.
That's true, but where does that get

us?

21
22

It is a factual question as to how

MR. MALLIN:

That gets us under the Seventh

Amendment.
QUESTION:

Why?

There are dozens and dozens of

24

things --we just heard a case where there were all kinds

25

of facts which judges decide.

Because of the

I'm trying to

13

get you to discuss this because I read many of those, not

14

all of the cases, and I couldn't find something that was

15

directly on point, not even Learned Hand, because the

16

earlier part of the opinion you're thinking of seems to go

'

17

just the other way and the part that you're thinking of

18

seemed to have involved a factual matter that had to do

19

with the word saturation, which they agreed about the

20

meaning of.

21

MR. MALLIN:

Under the understanding -- under

22

the jurisprudence of the Seventh Amendment under decisions

23

of this case, factual issues on the merits of a claim are

for the jury.

saying what would you say is the strongest case in your

2

favor in respect to the factual question as to how the

3

industry understands the meaning of a term in a patent

4

application, a term that will give the person who holds it

5

a monopoly under the law to exclude competitors.

6

that's the precise thing.

7

there is nothing that favors you on that precise point.

8

9

MR. MALLIN:

Now,

What your opponents say is

On that precise point, we go back

to the common law practice where in Liardet v. Johnson,

10

Awkwright v. Nightingale, and other cases at common law

11

the meaning of patent terms were submitted to the jury.

12

Those particular cases involved validity issues.

13

But it is -- was understood at common law and it

14

is understood in law today that the patent means the same

15

thing for infringement as it does for validity.

16

wouldn't make any sense otherwise.

17

one thing at one stage of the trial and another thing at

18

another stage of the trial.

19

QUESTION:

It

A patent can't mean

But your opponents argue, if I

20

understand it, that there is an issue today, the issue in

21

this case, that was not a jury issue, in fact was not

22

understood as an independent issue at the time that you

23

refer to as your standard of practice, and that was there

24

was not the modern notion of patent claim, and therefore

25

there was not an issue of construing a patent claim.

Your opponents say that the two kinds of issues

1

2

that the old juries considered were issues of enablement

3

and I guess issues of just design identity.
MR. MALLIN:

4
5

Yes, whether there was sufficient

disclosure --

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. MALLIN:

Right.
-- whether it was an advancement of

8

novelty in a prior art, and those kind of issues were left

9

to the jury which necessarily involved the jury

10

interpreting what the specifications mean in order to

11

decide whether -QUESTION:

12

But they say the specifications that

13

you're talking about are simply different kinds of

14

statements from the statement of claim.
And you say in your reply brief, well, the word

15
16

claim was not used in the 18th and early 19th century as

17

it is used today, but that issue was still there.

follow you to your conclusion.

MR. MALLIN:

Yes.

And that's something quite

different from what we're talking about in the modern

9

sense of claim I take it.

MR. MALLIN:

No, I don't think it is.

1

MR. MALLIN:

2

Eventually the statute in 1836 specifically

3

I claim.

referred to the word claim.
The statute of 1870 had a specific requirement,

4
5

that is the modern patent practice, that the specification

6

end with the word I claim and then set forth the

7

invention.

It was always required to set forth the

8

invention.

This is just a particular way in modern

9

practice that you set it forth, and the claim in modern

10

practice is interpreted in light of the specifications.

11

It would be rare for the specification not to include a

12

term that's in the claim.

13

So, our position, Justice Souter, is that that

14

formal distinction, that rearranging which does not go to

15

the substance of the matter cannot undermine precedent at

16

common law that -- where judges, Lord Mansfield in

17

particular, the name of the judge at common law, submitted

18

the interpretation of the specification to the jury.

19

formal differences in claim practices cannot eliminate the

20

Seventh Amendment right.

21

QUESTION:

So, the specification of the early

22

cases includes the claim as we understand it today.

23

That's -- is that in a nutshell your position?

QUESTION:

8

9

Otherwise, it would be easy to get rid

But, Mr. Mallin, you agree I think

that the scope of the claim, the construction of the claim

10

is a question of law for the court, but you are

11

distinguishing interpretation of a term from the ultimate

12

question.

13

Well, why don't those two go together?

14

if the court is charged with making the ultimate

15

determination of the scope of what's encompassed within

16

the claim, then why shouldn't subsidiary matters on the

17

way to that ultimate determination also be made by the

18

court?

19

MR. MALLIN:

That is,

Justice Ginsburg, because of the

20

Seventh Amendment.

21

hear is that the construction of the claim, the

22

construction of the patent is an ultimate question of law,

23

but until recently it was also said the underlying factual

disputes are for the fact finder, a judge when it's a case

this kind of question.

MR. MALLIN:

QUESTION:

You were careful to say on the

Yes.
But in threshold questions, for

6

example, jurisdictional questions like diversity of

7

citizenship -- there's a dispute about where one of the

8

parties resides -- that's -- and it's a fact question.

9

It's a fact question.

But the question of is the

10

jurisdictional requirement met is a question for the

11

court, and so we don't have the jury hearing the evidence.

12

There may well be evidence on that question, but it's

13

determined by the court, right, even though it's a fact

14

question.

15

MR. MALLIN:

It's determined by the court and it

16

was determined by the court, as far as I understand, at

17

common law.

18

I think the judge's decisions on the facts on

19

jurisdiction would be appealable under the clearly

20

erroneous rule.

21

It's not -- the effort here, Your Honor, is to

22

say this matter of what the claim means is a legal

they?
MR. MALLIN:

3

No.

The judge in these cases --

the trial judge first held that this was a legal question,

Wasn't there one or more dissents

court level?

Maybe a concurring opinion.

MR. MALLIN:

9

Yes, there was a short concurring

opinion where a concurring judge indicated that he didn't

position.

2

dollars associated with the invoices.
QUESTION:

3

Supposing this -- the word inventory

4

appeared in a contract and there was no evidence aliunde,

5

as they say, no evidence of intent, do you think that a

6

judge could interpret that as a -- without submitting it

7

to the jury even though it was quite debatable on either

8

side as to what it meant?
MR. MALLIN:

9

Well, it depends on the particular

10

circumstances, but if the issue is what does the word

11

inventory mean in the particular industry that's involved

12

in a contract, Professor Corbin and Professor Williston

13

would say yes.

question in a jury trial --

That meaning of language is a factual

QUESTION:

15

So, then if you have a contract that

16

uses the word inventory and there's no testimony as to

17

what people meant, it's simply a documented, written kind

18

of -- that is a factual question that would go to the

19

jury?

20

MR. MALLIN:

Well, in order for it to be a

21

factual question to go to the jury, someone must offer

22

evidence on it as to its meaning to the industry involved.

23

QUESTION:

Well, okay.

Supposing that I am --

24

that we have this contract with the word inventory in it

and someone comes in and says,

MR. MALLIN:

that the analogy is in the particular contract, if this is

the relevant question, what does inventory mean in a

No.

And the patent analogy to contract is made

8

sometimes, but we have to remember what a patent and its

But ordinarily I understood the law

to be that the terms of a written contract are interpreted

as a matter of law.

18

MR. MALLIN:

It isn't a question of fact.
Williston and Corbin, as we cite in

19

our brief, in some cases make the distinction that is

20

similar to the distinction in patent law, that the

21

construction of the patent -- of the contract in your

hypothetical is for the court, its legal effect, but if

23

there's a question about the meaning of language, that's a

QUESTION:

Well, if we find that -- if we

disagree with you on how persuasive and clear that direct

authority is, then do you think that we can legitimately

QUESTION:

2

Well, but it does seem to me more

There is

there is an interest in a uniform interpretation of the

Maybe you'll disagree, but I should think

8

And it seems to me that if the interpretation of

the patent is a question for the court, a question of law,

or at least a question of interpretation makes a question

11

it's the practicality of it.

Would you explain that?

You may explain briefly.

MR. GRIFFIN:

I think it is a weak analogy

15

contract to the requisite community which is skilled in

patent documents themselves which frame the --

QUESTION:

Yes, you wouldn't use the term if you

weren't, writing a patent.
MR. GRIFFIN:

And it frataes the inquiry.

And

when you are hearing outside the patent documents from

27

somebody, you have the documents themselves which are

22

written in an objectively directed fashion to judge what

24

v hat meaning is.

Well, surely -It would be held invalid.
Surely there's a separate issue of

whether there b s been an infringement or not.

I mean,

21

there's not just the definition of the patent.

There's

also whether the competing instrument was an infringement.

That's still left entirely to the jury, isn't it?

whether the contract was complied with or not.
MR. MALLIN:

There's a lot more left La a

contract case, Your Honor, but it isn't the same thing in
a jury case where the term analysis, what does that cover?
When that's determined, what is a genuine: issue of fact,
by the judge, there's really nothing significant left for
the jury, as Judge Mayer pointed out.
