ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. BLUME:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:

10

•

We'll hear argument

This case presents several questions regarding

11

whether and under what circumstances the President is

12

permitted to create aggravating factors for military

13

capital cases.
In this Court we have presented several

15

challenges to the creation of these factors, ranging from

16

the most broad to this is a nondelegatable power to the

17

most narrow, that Congress failed to provide the President

18

with an intelligible principle.

19

these issues, however, some historical perspective is

20

necessary.

21

In considering all of

In Article I, section 8, clause 14, the Framers

22

gave to Congress and not the President the plenary power

23

to make rules for the Government regulation of the land

24

and naval forces.

The Framers and those who influenced their

Mr. Lowenfield, before you go too

much further -- I'm sorry.

Mr. Blume.

I'm thinking of

the case I'm going to ask you about.
There -- most of your argument is based on

separation of powers.

13

problem.

14

There is another separation of

Even if we assume that the President has no

15

power to specify what crimes shall be subject to the death

16

penalty, Congress itself in 10 U.S.C., section

17

specified two.

18

unlawfully kills a human being when he, number one, has a

1

premeditated design to kill, and number four, is engaged

20

in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of burglary,

21

sodomy, rape, robbery or aggravated arson.

22

instances, Congress has said he shall suffer death or

23

imprisonment for life.

It has specifically said that anyone who

is sufficient, it doesn't matter whether or not the

crimes?

All article 118 is -- it

No, it's quite

different because the way 918 -- this is on page 145 of

14

the joint appendix, by the way.

murder and shall suffer such punishment as a court-martial

19

whether the President has the authority to specify what

20

shall obtain the death penalty.

21

The way 918 ends is, in

And if it ended there, then you would

It doesn't end there, though.

And it says,

22

except that if found guilty under clause 1 or 4, he shall

23

suffer death or imprisonment for life as a court-martial

24

may direct.

25

Now, why isn't that an adequate specification

MR. BLUME:

But, Justice Scalia, there were

15

numerous statutes which existed like this at the time of

16

Furman, all of which were found to be unconstitutional.

17

Pennsylvania made the argument on rehearing after Furman

that premeditation is enough, that we have narrowed

and that is one of the things that distinguished that.

You have a specific mens rea

You don't have that here.

You have either

you can be found guilty of murder, or felony murder,

Because

you still have the mens rea requirement necessary for

You simply have the overlay of these felonies as

That's not a dispensation with mens rea.

I mean, in this regard it's just a little

different grammatically of the Federal murder statute, 20

U.S.C. 1 -- 1011.
QUESTION:

4

Enmund I think supports your position

5

there, that you can't automatically transpose the mens rea

6

for a felony to a killing and still have capital

7

punishment for it.

8

MR. BLUME:

That's correct.

9

And what's also -- I mean, it's also Furman and

10

Gregg and the other cases when they indicate that there

11

has to be murder plus something, and it has to be done at

12

some phase of the proceeding.

13

There has to be a principled way to distinguish people

14

But, I mean, I don't think in any event no one

has ever argued -- the Government has never even argued --

that 118 standing alone is constitutionally sufficient.

May I just go back to where your

without mens rea, aren't we?

Assuming that there are aggravating

MR. BLUME:
QUESTION:

The aggravating factors

Well, that's true.
So, why isn't your argument that

11

there's no mens rea requirement and therefore there's

12

something more fundamentally defective than simply the

13

problem of delegation with respect to aggravating factors?

14

MR. BLUME:

Well, it's -- there are a number of

15

States in which you can be found guilty of murder, and

16

then there has -- under some type of felony murder basis,

17

and then at sentencing there has to be some other

18

additional finding, some other aggravating finding.

19

QUESTION:

No, but I thought your argument -- I

20

just want to understand your argument, and I thought your

21

argument was, in response to Justice Scalia, that in fact

22

that still leaves us with an incomplete murder statute

23

because there's no mens rea requirement.

let's assume, with proper delegation or with congressional

Right?

MR. BLUME:

10

No.

What I was trying to say is, is

11

that all 118 does is provide four different theories under

12

which you can be found guilty of murder.

13
14

QUESTION:

Yes, and I thought you said one of

the things that it doesn't provide is mens rea.

15

MR. BLUME:

118(1) is if you kill

intent to kill which our case law requires?

MR. BLUME:

No.

Isn't that

I don't think there's any

And what is your best case for that

MR. BLUME:

The best -- I think the fundamental

problem with delegating this to the President, if you want

8

to get down to the root of it -- there are several

9

problems with it, in addition to the history and wanting

10

to keep the executive out of this power, but it creates

11

the impermissible blending of functions.

12

13
14

QUESTION:

I asked what your best case was for

that proposition.
MR. BLUME:

The best case I think would be Ex

the President has the power to create substantive rules of

17

law in court-martial context, then you have the

18

impermissible blending of functions.

any sort of delegation.

that the aggravating factors are an element of the crime,

do you?

MR. BLUME:

This Court has referred to

aggravating circumstances --

6

QUESTION:

MR. BLUME:

I thought that was clear.
I think you have to look at -- this

Court has called aggravating circumstances substantive

criteria at the level of legislative definition.

12

why - QUESTION:

Do you take the position that the

No.

I take the position that they

are substantive factors.

MR. BLUME:

That's

No?

The answer is no?

This Court has said they are not

elements of the crime.

QUESTION:

19

MR. BLUME:

Right.

That's correct.

But substantive procedure, Justice

20

O'Connor, is a spectrum and things fall along a spectrum.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The President acted within his statutory and

16

constitutional authority when he promulgated rule for

17

courts-martial 1004 to limit the circumstances in which

18

the death penalty, when otherwise specifically authorized

19

by the Uniform Code of Military Justice, may be imposed.

20

If the President had promulgated rule 1004 in

21

1964 prior to Furman, rather than in 1984 after Furman,

22

his action would have been applauded by most as

23

enlightened and protective of the rights of service

24

members and properly so.

25

The rule establishes important limitations on

the imposition of the death penalty and therefore guards

2

against the arbitrary or wanton imposition of that penalty

3

that this Court was concerned about in Furman.

4

The rule establishes procedures to be followed

5

by a court-martial in determining whether to impose the

6

penalty, and it provides that the death penalty may be

7

imposed only when the court-martial finds one of -- at

8

least one of enumerated factors, aggravating factors, that

the President concluded warranted the imposition of the

10

death penalty.

QUESTION:

Was it clear in this case that it was

the felony aspect of the homicides committed with

14

premeditation that were the aggravators?

There were three aggravating

QUESTION:

10

Mr. Kneedler, may I interrupt you at

this point?

12

written before Furman with this regime can govern

14

Because you are assuming that a statute

In other words, you're assuming the correctness

15

of the military court's position in Matthews that there

16

was an infirmity, the lack of narrowing circumstances, and

17

that that infirmity could be cured by the executive or by

18

the legislature.

19
20

So, you're rejecting Mr. Blume's first point.
You're assuming that that's not worth arguing.

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, we think that's not

22

correct, and as you pointed out, the rationale of the

23

decision in Matthews was not that the death authorizing

24

provision in 118 was unconstitutional and had to be

25

stricken.

To the contrary, the court in Matthews

concluded that the statute was still valid and

2

specifically contemplated that the President could

3

promulgate the aggravating factors and indeed contemplated

4

that those could then be applied in the case of Matthews

5

himself.

QUESTION:

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

Now, the President did not do

that.

9
10

My question --

QUESTION:

My question to you is, was Matthews

right to that extent?
MR. KNEEDLER:

11

Yes.

We think Matthews was

12

correct because there's nothing in this Court's -- in

13

Furman or this Court's Eighth Amendment jurisprudence that

14

establishes the separation of powers principle requiring

15

that it be a legislature to prescribe the aggravating

16

factors.

QUESTION:

Well, not so far as the State level

18

is concerned, as Justice Scalia asked -- said.

20

particular separation of powers.

21

Federal level, the Constitution does require the division

22

that we know between the legislature and the executive.

I don't

But the -- on the

24

system we believe the Matthews court got it right as well

1

Furman framework, what the Matthews court found was that

2

the overall system for determining whether death shall be

3

imposed did not sufficiently protect against the arbitrary

4

imposition of the death penalty.

5

Well, in the military the system is erected by

6

the combined power of Congress in passing statutes, in

7

this case a statute both authorizing the imposition of the

8

death penalty and authorizing the President to establish

9

procedures and limits on the penalties, and of course, the

10

President's powers both pursuant to that statute and

11

pursuant to his inherent authority as commander-in-chief.

12

So, the -- particularly in the military context,

13

we think that the separation of powers argument does not

14

carry any force because the President has preexisting

15

inherent authority which is aided and augmented by the

16

Congress in the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

17

The Matthews court recognized that and said all

18

we are holding is that the system currently in place, as

19

erected by the combined powers of the Congress and the

20

President, is not sufficient, but either one can cure the

defect we've identified.

The Court had a footnote in Mistretta putting to one side

military justice system where the President sits at the --

the military justice system, he's uniquely positioned.

QUESTION:

Turning back to the hypothetical case

MR. KNEEDLER:

It's really an expanding factor.

If a

Right.

But for these purposes --

13

and we think particularly for whether the code should be

read to authorize the President to adopt these factors, we

think it would be odd, indeed, if Congress had withheld

MR. KNEEDLER:

What the court said is the death

situations that were then available, but specifically said

15

that the President could fill up that gap by -- under his

we think it's clear, that putting all those together, that

the Matthews court got it right in not striking down the

I should also say that what we have here is the

combined judgment of not only the President of the United

States, as advised by the Justice Department and the

Secretary of Defense when he promulgated rule 1004, but

MR. KNEEDLER:

That's right.

You can perpetrate the killing

without intending to kill.
MR. KNEEDLER:

that the -- first of all, 118 doesn't contain that intent

requirement, but the aggravating factor -QUESTION:

you do say there is an intent to kill requirement in 118,

invalid.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Again, for the substantive

there has been no claim here that the aggravating factor

QUESTION:

And as to that, again

I don't want to make matters worse,

7

but as I read this, at least on page 4 of the petitioner's

appendix where they have it here, the aggravating factors

9

in respect to robbery, felony murder, et cetera apply only

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

relevant to the case.

There's paragraph 7(b) and (j) and

under article 118(4).
But, again, there's been no claim by petitioner

in this case that the aggravating factors are

substantively invalid, and there has been independent

weighing of all the aggravating circumstances and

MR. KNEEDLER:

And we think the two of them

16

I should also point out that article 71 provides

that before the death penalty may be imposed, the -- it

particularly unlikely that Congress would have -- would

QUESTION:

Such cases as Swaim and

Mr. Kneedler, does the Government

We have not taken issue with

14

The court in Matthews held that it was not as

We do say, though, in footnote 6 of our brief

15

that there may be sufficient narrowing in this case within

16

the Lowenfield definition because this is a statute that

2

imposition of the death penalty which is the fundamental

3

principle of this Court's decision in Furman.

4

I would also point out that article 55 of the

5

U.C.M.J. contains its own cruel or unusual punishment

prohibition, and we think that that adds further force to

the authority of the President to tailor punishments

situation such as Furman to -- not to mention his

responsibility to take care that the laws be faithfully

executed, to tailor the military justice system to satisfy
