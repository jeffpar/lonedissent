ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER KOON
MR. OLSON:

9
10

11

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case involves the kind of fact -intensive

12

decision that district judges make 40,000 times each year.

13

It is the type of decision that trial judges are ideally

14

suited to make, that appellate judges have neither the

15

institutional competence nor resources to make, and that

16

Congress and the Sentencing Reform Act explicitly vested

17

in the district courts, and it is the kind of reasoned

18

decisionmaking that Congress expected would provide vital

19

data to the Sentencing Commission's continuous evolution

20

and refinement of the Sentencing Guidelines.

21

The sentencing judge in this case made his

22

decision to depart from the Sentencing Guideline range

23

after presiding over a 7-week trial and a lengthy

24

sentencing process involving detailed factual submissions

25

by all of the parties.

He explained each aspect of his

decision and his reasoning in a 54-page sentencing

2

memorandum.

3

Each reason for departing from the guidelines

4

was well documented and based upon the specific, highly

5

unusual facts of this particular case.

6

predicated on factors that are either encouraged as

7

departure grounds by the Sentencing Commission or not

8

forbidden or discouraged by the Sentencing Commission.

Each departure was

It is important to state at the outset that

9
10

Congress explicitly authorized sentencing judges to depart

11

from the prescribed sentencing ranges if they find factors

12

of a kind or to a degree not taken into consideration by

13

the commission in formulating the guidelines.

14

according to the commission, requires determining whether

15

a case is unusual, atypical, or outside the heartland of

16

the guideline range prescribed for this particular

17

offense.

18

This is a highly fact-bound inquiry.

This,

Congress

19

stated that sentencing judges were to have the flexibility

20

and were required to impose that -- use that flexibility

21

to impose individualized sentences when warranted by

22

aggravating or mitigating factors not taken into account

23

by the guidelines.

24
25

Sentencing judges are to be guided by numerous
factors in deciding whether a case is outside the

heartland of the case.

2

Rivera case from the First Circuit, a district judge is

3

going to use the facts of the case, as found by him, to

4

which deference must be given unless they're clearly

5

erroneous, his experience or her experience as a

6

sentencing judge, the intuition developed over years of

7

sentencing, other statutes, the guidelines themselves, the

8

sentencing regime prescribed by the guidelines, and to

9

bring all that institutional superior feel, as the Rivera

10

court put it, together to the case to determine whether a

11

case is unusual or not.
QUESTION:

12

As explained for the Court in the

Mr. Olson, let me ask about the first

13

point that you make in your argument, and which I guess

14

you're coming to now, whether in deciding this question we

15

use the abuse of discretion standard or we decide de novo

16

whether the particular factor is allowable under the

17

guidelines.

18
19

Does it really make any difference?

Does it

really make any difference?

20

MR. OLSON:

21

QUESTION:

Well, I -Because what is being contended by

22

the Government is that certain of these factors are not

23

lawful factors, that the guidelines do not permit them to

24

be used.

25

Now, if we reviewed it de novo, we would come to

1

the conclusion, assuming the Government's right, you're

2

right, the guidelines do not permit them to be used.

3

we did it under an abuse of discretion standard, we would

4

say, well, of course it is always an abuse of discretion

5

to violate the law, and therefore we have before us the

6

same question:

7

Whichever standard you use, the appellate court has the

8

same question before it:

9

particular factor?

Does the guidelines permit it to be used?

Is it lawful to use this

10

I don't see why we - -

11

MR. OLSON:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

If

What the --- should bother fighting about what

standard to use.
MR. OLSON:

The answer to that question is --

15

indeed, the answer, I can state directly that it does make

16

a great deal of difference, because it is an experience

17

that sentencing judges get.

18

What the Sentencing Commission intended to occur

19

is that, and the Sentencing Commission specifically said

20

that it is difficult to prescribe a single set of

21

guidelines that encompasses the vast range of human

22

conduct potentially relevant to a Sentencing Commission,

23

so what the Sentencing - - to a sentencing decision.

24

what the Sentencing Commission did is elaborate on what

25

the experience of district judges had been and create a

So

1

typical sentence for a heartland-type case, but it -QUESTION:

2

I understand, but you're missing my

3

point.

The abuse of discretion standard simply says,

4

within this broad range of the unlawful on this side and

5

the unlawful on that side, the court can do whatever it

6

wants in the middle.

7

Now, when it goes into the unlawful, it

8

automatically abuses its discretion, and the contention

9

here is that certain factors cannot lawfully be

10

considered.
MR. OLSON:

11

The answer to the question, if there

12

is an abuse of discretion, it is unlawful, but it is

13

important that that abuse of discretion standard take

14

place.

The Congress specifically said -QUESTION:

15

Well, if it makes you feel better I'm

16

willing to decide it that way, but I'm going to be asking

17

myself the same question.

18

factor?

19

MR. OLSON:

Is it lawful to consider this

Well, the decision itself as to

20

whether or not a case falls within the guidelines involves

21

the ascertainment of the facts of a particular case and

22

deciding whether the facts of that case make it unusual or

23

atypical in a particular situation.

1

a particular factor that could in some circumstances be

2

used should have been used in this case, and I will

3

acknowledge, and I don't think the Government contests

4

that that is subject to abuse of discretion.

5
6

7
8

But the question of whether the factor is ever
allowable -MR. OLSON:

The factor is allowable, according

to the Sentencing Commission, to which the authority to
make those decisions was explicitly delegated by Congress.

10

According to the Sentencing Commission, unless we

11

articulate -- and I'm reading from part 1A(4)(b) of the

12

Sentencing Guidelines, with the specific exceptions of

13

factors taken off the table by the Sentencing Commission,

14

the commission does not intend to limit the kind of

15

factors, whether or not mentioned in the guidelines, that

16

could constitute grounds for departure.

17

QUESTION:

18

that's a different question.

1

question, that's the merits question --

Now you're arguing the merits, and
That's not the standard

20

MR. OLSON:

21

QUESTION:

-- and I'm happy to discuss that.

22

MR. OLSON:

We submit that they're tightly

23

interwoven among one another.

24

QUESTION:

25

Well, the -- they're --

I think you're saying that this case

cannot involve a question of lawfulness versus

1

unlawfulness, is that what you're saying?
MR. OLSON:

2

What we're saying is that the

3

authority to determine whether or not a departure could

4

exist from the Sentencing Guidelines was delegated by

5

Congress to the Sentencing Commission.
The Sentencing Commission stated that certain

6

7

factors were off-limits, the rest of the factors were on-

8

limits within the sentencing discretion limits, and that

9

these factors considered in this case were within that

10

discretion.
QUESTION:

11

And because this is not a case

12

involving the application of an off-limits consideration,

13

the issue here cannot be an issue, whether it was lawful

14

or not.

15

MR. OLSON:

16

QUESTION:

Exactly.
You start with the premise that it

17

was lawful, and you say, within the realm of lawfulness,

18

what can it do?

19

MR. OLSON:

20

QUESTION:

That's -So that -- I mean, your case, then,

21

is really not so much a case about what the standard ought

22

to be, it's a case that's going to turn on whether we

23

agree with you that in fact there can be a lawfulness

24

versus unlawfulness decision about particular factors or

25

reasons in this case.

MR. OLSON:

Williams decision --

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. OLSON:

As this Court indicated in the

Couldn't we see the case that way?
Well, except to the extent that it

5

seems to me that that decision is constrained by the

6

scheme set up by Congress which delegated certain

7

authorities to make -- authority to make those decisions

8

to the Sentencing Commission, and the Sentencing

9

Commission in this case has made those decisions.

10

QUESTION:

Well, the record -- if there's no

11

difference between the abuse of discretion standard and

12

the de novo standard, we might as well dismiss this

13

petition as improperly granted, because that's the only

14

question raised in the petition.

15

MR. OLSON:

We are not agreeing with that,

16

Mr. Chief Justice.

17

that was made here, which is the application of the

18

guidelines to the facts of this case, which is an explicit

19

appellate review standard articulated in the statute

20

itself, the application of the guidelines to the facts of

21

the case, which is what the district judge did here, is

22

subject to a due deference standard specifically adopted

23

by Congress.

QUESTION:

We're suggesting that the decision

it were, is an easy issue as you see it is that there

2

as an issue of discretion.

3

MR. OLSON:

4

QUESTION:

5

This has got to be viewed

In -And I suppose that if we all agree

with you there, there isn't very much left to argue about.
MR. OLSON:

6

Well -- well, I think that the case

7

is that simple, because the --as Justice Breyer explained

8

in his article in the Hofstra Law Review in 1988, the

9

Sentencing Commission explicitly stated that most factors

10

that might be eligible as departure factors have already

11

been decided by the commission as eligible for

12

consideration.

«

13

The commission has said, we are not deciding

14

unusual cases.

15

judges to tell us when a case is unusual or not, and the

16

reason why that decision, the authority for which is

17

vested directly in the district courts, should be made by

18

district courts, is because district courts, day in and

19

day out, are where the rubber meets the road.

20

We need the decisionmaking by district

QUESTION:

Yes, but you are also saying that

21

there can be no unusualness question which raises an issue

22

of law as distinct from an issue of discretion, and the

23

reason it cannot raise an issue of law is that the only

24

issues of law are issues involving whether something has

25

been explicitly taken off the table or not.

I believe that that's a fair

But is it understanding of your

argument?
MR. OLSON:

6

And -- because we're basing that

7

argument on the guidelines and this Court's decision in

8

Williams, I must hasten to say that it's conceivable, I

9

suppose, although I have not thought of one, where a pure

10

question of law with respect to a departure factor could

11

come up.
QUESTION:

12

Well, it's obvious that there -- I

13

mean, that isn't -- you could -- isn't the answer, it

depends?

16

a pure question of law whether a particular case, this

17

falls within that, and the district court has nothing to

18

do with it.

19

If -- there are certain factors like race, which
It's

Then there could be other situations where the

20

reason that this is not unusual has to do with

21

interpreting another guidelines, e.g., does this kind of

22

conduct fall within the heartland of the physical abuse

23

guideline or assault guideline or something else?

24

a pure question of law.

25

Then there's a third kind of question.

That's

The

1

third kind of question is, are these circumstances

2

unusual?

3

a question of law.

4

one that you think goes primarily to the district judge.

In respect to that one, though, it's technically

5

MR. OLSON:

I take it that kind of decision is the

Clearly that is the case, except to

6

the extent that the only argument that I would offer with

7

respect to that second category is that that -- if it's

8

purely an interpretation --

9

QUESTION:

10

MR. OLSON:

11

Yes.
-- of the guideline it is almost

never going to be purely an interpretation of --

12

QUESTION:

Oh, no, it might be in this very

13

case.

For example, one of the reasons that there was

14

departed here, one of the reasons for the departure is

15

whether or not two prosecutions, one under a Civil Rights

16

Act and one under a State law, is a justification for

17

departure.

18

I would have thought that raises a pure question

19

of law.

underlying

there.

I don't see what

sentencing.

1

The Court might well consider that the specter of

2

unfairness under those circumstances would make this case

unusual.

That would be an entirely permissible -QUESTION:

4

What the district court knows about

5

is what's unusual.

comparative advantage about is the comparative policies

7

that underlie double jeopardy, different statutes,

8

different guidelines, et cetera.
MR. OLSON:

9

What the district court doesn't have a

I agree with that, but that makes it

10

unnecessary for the district court in making that

unusualness decision to consider both the facts and the

15

That makes it a mixed question of fact and law,

QUESTION:

Well, as a predicate matter, when the

district court addresses this issue, let's take the

hypothetical issue of the twin -- double prosecutions.

QUESTION:

4

Did the commission consider this -Well, all law, Mr. Olson, is applied

to the facts of a particular case.
MR. OLSON:

But just like this case is a

paradigm example of that, the peculiar facts inform the

decision with respect to whether or not the Sentencing

QUESTION:

No, no, but can't we have an orderly

process in which we first ask, was this factor taken into

As to that, and that only, is that not a

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. KOPENY

3

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER POWELL

4
5
6

MR. KOPENY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question that this Court granted certiorari

7

as to petitioner Powell included a second question and

8

that was, what was the correct analysis of the departure

9

in this case, and I take it that this Court would not

10

conclude its decision in this case by simply saying what

11

the name of the standard of review is for reviewing

12

departures, particularly because it is the -- at the core

13

of the dispute between the parties in this case is the way

14

the Ninth Circuit went about applying what it called the

15

de novo standard and the way that the parties contend the

16

reviewing court should proceed.

17

The opinion in Rivera as I read it states that

18

there is an initial pure question of law which is to be

19

decided, but it's to be decided as I think Justice Souter

20

pointed out in his dissent in the Burns case, without

21

regard to the evidence or facts of the case.

22

That is that, as a matter of law, a reviewing

23

court or a district court can tell whether a particular

24

factor was either taken into account or adequately taken

25

into account by the guidelines commission, and that there

are, as Justice Breyer said in the Rivera opinion,

questions of interpretation of words or formulas of words

in statutes and guidelines which circuit courts or

MR. KOPENY:

Your Honor, I believe that there's

a two-step process, and that clearly any reviewing court

which is properly called plenary, or de novo.

your entire argument to de novo versus abuse of

difference in approach on appeal.

MR. KOPENY:

Right.

this, that by calling what the Ninth Circuit did here de

about the number of points that a district judge may

MR. KOPENY:

Is there any guidance

In 18

I understand at least Justice Souter's dissent in Burns,

that means an abuse of discretion standard.

QUESTION:

Does the district judge have -- since

he has to justify his departure, does he have an

obligation to explain why it's 5 rather than 1 or 2?

4

MR. KOPENY:

I don't know that he has an

5

obligation to contrast it with other potential departures,

6

but he does have an obligation to find that it's unusual,

7

to describe the degree to which it's present, and the

8

guidelines are very specific in 5K2.10 with the six

9

factors that he must evaluate, and in this case there was

10

a very specific sentencing memorandum by Judge Davies, the

11

district judge, who -- in which he went through chapter

12

and verse of the findings of which of those factors were

present and to what degree.

about how the victim in this case, after being tased and

because he was an unsearched felony suspect at that time.

reject again, as a matter of law, the Government's claim

1

that the lack of contemporaneous provocation and offense

2

conduct means that this was an inappropriate guideline to

3

use, that is, the encouraged departure downward for

4

misconduct by the victim.

5

However, there is a point here that I think is

6

essential to the Court's resolution of this legal

7

question, and that is this.

8

philosophy of the guidelines, there is a

9

compartmentalizing of the various elements.

As I read the basic

10

For example, in any police misconduct case,

11

whether it's conspiracy to violate someone's right to

12

vote, or whether it's assaulting someone and using

13

unreasonable force, the guidelines gives a formula for

14

addressing punishment to that element of the crime.

15

there's really a fact-based analysis here which sort of

16

prevents the Government from drastically changing the

17

sentence by changing what charges it files, so that the

18

offense conduct element in this case is 15 elements, 15

19

levels of sentencing for the aggravated assault.

20

But

I take it that the Government's argument should

21

be rejected that in a police misconduct case you can never

22

give -- you can never find victim misconduct mitigating

23

because all the judge did was find that the departure

24

downward for victim misconduct applied to that 15 levels

25

of aggravated assault.

1

In other words, I think there is a limit on that

2

discretion, Your Honor, that if Judge Davies had gone 16

3

or more levels, and cut into the punishment for the

4

violation of civil rights rather than simply reduced by a

5

third the element of the punishment in this case that

6

addressed the aggravated assault, then I think there would

7

be a fairly strong argument that there was an abuse of

discretion in finding the degree of departure to exceed
that which was the predicate for the departure, that is,

10

the assault itself.

11

QUESTION:

Do we know which portion was

12

attributable to aggravated assault and which was

13

attributable to the violation of civil rights?

14

MR. KOPENY:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

The

15

guidelines are clear and specific about it.

16

if there had been no aggravated assault there would have

17

been 10 levels attributable to civil rights.

18

to civil rights violation.

1

offense level is higher, there were 15 for aggravated

assault and 6 for the civil rights violation, so we know

that the departure of 5 is well within the aggravated

assault component of the sentencing.

of the reasons?

MR. KOPENY:

QUESTION:

No, we don't, and -So don't we then -- suppose we

4

thought that in respect to some of the reasons it is a

5

matter where he has expertise and can decide how unusual,

6

but as to others, it's purely a question of law.

7

the court of appeals could decide these in respect to

8

others, like the double jeopardy type thing.

9

do we do then?

10

MR. KOPENY:

That is,

Is -- what

Justice Breyer, if you're referring

11

to the 3-level combination departure and not including the

12

discussion of the 5 levels for victimless conduct, then

13

yes, I think Your Honor is right that the analysis of that

14

would require the Court to have due regard for the facts

15

and to defer to those aspects, or those factors under the

16

added punishment departure that were experiential and

17

related to what a district judge could do.

18

But where there's a pure question of law, then I

19

think that a circuit court might be able to determine it

20

was an inappropriate factor.

21

However, I would urge caution in the two that

22

the Government have made their strongest points on.

is this lack of recidivism being prohibited, and the other

24

is the one about the Government making a charging decision

As I've indicated in, I believe the reply,

3

petitioner's reply brief, the guidelines do address the

4

question of when the court thinks its unfair that the

5

Government has made a particular charging decision and

6

suggests that that might be addressed by a departure.

7

So even though it's legal, completely legal for

8

the Government to choose one charge offense over another,

9

if the Government -- if the court in its experience

10

detects a specter of unfairness, the guidelines encourages

11

a district judge to depart downward based on that sense of

12

unfairness, and I would urge the Court not to reach too

13

quickly the conclusion that, because double jeopardy is

14

not violated here, there is no specter of unfairness which

15

a district judge is uniquely qualified to detect, and

16

which the guidelines would prohibit, as a matter of law,

the district judge considering in the mix with all the

18

other combined factors in determining that that unfairness

19

should be addressed by a departure.

understand it by the judge in this case of any factor

MR. KOPENY:

Wouldn't that be a proper

No, it couldn't, and perhaps it's

because -- I misunderstood your former question, but the

why he thought there should be a departure in this case.

considered, that it is inappropriate for the district

judge to be straitjacketed into not considering the whole

of the remainder of the case in determining to what degree

departure is appropriate.

14

In other words, where the judge says, as in

Williams, or for example there's -- this is not a

combination departure, but there's a departure, and here

are the three separate reasons, then I think the remand

might be required, or obviously will be.

But where the judge says, I think an additional

3-level departure is appropriate, and these are the

21

factors that I'm identifying in combination, that it isn't

clear that it would be illegal or, as a matter of law,

So I think that there is still some more work to

2

do in drawing the inference that this case fits under

3

Williams, because it's different in that regard.

4

think it's also correct to say that when we look at the

5

other factor, take the question of recidivism, it seems

right that at least in the Ninth Circuit at the time this

case was decided it was the law that if a person is in

also -- and therefore the Government argues that's a

prohibited factor.

12

On the other hand, it's not clear that that is

13

all that Judge Davies was doing in discussing the fact

14

that as part of the mix, these defendants were not likely

15

to be a danger to anyone, and that's because in reviewing

16

the reasonableness of a departure the statute says, 37 --

17

well, 3742(e)(3) says that it's only in determining

18

whether the departure is unreasonable that the reviewing

1

court should look at those purposes of sentencing.

20

And one of the purposes of sentencing is

21

protection of society, so it's a fair thing for the

22

district judge to talk about whether or not these

23

defendants or this defendant would be a danger in

24

discussing the justification for a particular departure

25

and the level of it.

I think it's a question of how this district

2

judge's findings are read, but it is not clear that he

3

used an improper factor, rather, that he included in the

4

mix something which the guidelines require to be given

5

regard to, and that is, whether the person is a danger,

6

because obviously it would be unreasonable to set a

dangerous person loose, whereas it might be more

reasonable to give a person who is totally not dangerous a

MR. DREEBEN:

1

Let me, if I may, Justice Breyer,

2

address the statutory point that you raised and then turn

3

to the policy consideration of what a district court

4

should do and what a court of appeals should do.
This Court held in Williams v. United States

5
6

that the reasonableness determination and the component of

7

the statute that you read that refers to that goes only to

8

the second step of whether a resulting sentence is an

9

unreasonably high or low departure from the guidelines.

10

It only goes to magnitude.
The question of whether a departure is

11
12

permissible in the first place raises two antecedent

13

issues.

14

which it would be if, for example, a district court

15

departed based on an explicitly socioeconomic factor, or a

16

factor that is so close to a socioeconomic factor as to be

17

a proxy for it.

18

The first is whether it is a violation of law,

The second issue of law that is antecedent to

19

the reasonableness determination is whether there is a

20

misapplication of the guidelines which could occur, for

21

example, as the Court made clear again in the Williams

22

opinion, if the district court relied on a factor that the

23

Sentencing Commission has explicitly taken into

24

consideration and has given adequate consideration to.

no matter what, supposed to decide to every factual

9

circumstance, whether or not this particular odd factual

10

circumstance -- you know, the person had a low IQ, or, I

don't know, some very weird thing -- in each instance,

MR. DREEBEN:

Well --

That's your view of it?
No, I certainly wouldn't say they

All right, then the question is, what

kind of attention do they pay, and once you say that, you

21

get into the job of saying -- you get into the idea that

22

the kind of attention you should pay is the kind of

23

attention that comes out of their experience.

experience is to know when circumstances are unusual, so

MR. DREEBEN:

3

Well, Justice Breyer, I think that

4

the key factor is what they think is unusual will stem

5

from the experience that they derive from their courtrooms

6

hearing the particular cases that come across their

7

dockets.

8

9

Where the court of appeals have a distinct
advantage in that respect is the ability to harmonize the

10

results that are obtained in different district courts

11

throughout the circuit, which may have very different

12

circumstances.

13

A family circumstance that a district judge in

14

Manhattan may think is a ground for departure may be

15

entirely different from one that a judge sitting in

16

Hartford, Connecticut would think.

17

QUESTION:

So over time you get to understand

18

that, and over time a common law develops, and over time

19

it becomes more sensible, and that's either done in the

20

rubric of use of discretion, where it's the kind of thing

21

that depends on the expertise of the district court, or

22

it's done without any deference, or it's the kind of thing

23

that depends on purely legal interpretations.

4

there is not a statutory prescription or a policy

5

7

QUESTION:

And then once you're there, then they

8

say at least look at the question of how much violence was

9

involved in this instance and how much provocation, and

10

they're saying that that's a paradigm instance of where,

11

in fact, the district court has some experience as to

12

whether or not in this kind of case there is a lot, a

13

little, not too much violence by way of provocation, and

14

so there should have been deference in respect to that

15

matter.

16

MR. DREEBEN:

I -- well, there are several

17

reasons why I do not think that there should have been any

18

deference given in this case.

19

courts happen to see a very, very small sampling of civil

20

rights cases because there are few of them in the Federal

21

system, so that the idea that a particular district judge

is going to develop substantial expertise at gauging them

is probably not an experientially correct judgment.

MR. DREEBEN:

The courts of appeals would have

the ability to do what courts of appeals do best, which is

to evaluate the policies underlying the particular

are legal issues that govern the victim misconduct issue

What about assault cases?

Are there

a lot of assault cases in the district courts?
MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, there are a lot of assault

cases in the district courts.

15

QUESTION:

The factor of provocation was used in

16

this case to reduce the assault portion of the punishment,

17

not the civil rights violation portion of the punishment.

18

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think that in itself was

19

an error of law, Justice Scalia, because the guidelines

20

themselves provide that the departure question, whether a

21

guidelines sentence should be departed from, is the last

22

step in the process after all of the other factors have

been put into the mix, and in this case the only guideline

5

QUESTION:

A departure that would be made

Call it a component.

It was that

6

component that was reduced, and certainly unusualness with

7

regard to assault cases is really what should be relevant

8

in the case.

9

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, first of all, that raises

10

the legal issue of what should the proper comparison group

11

of typical cases be?

12

In the Government's view, when your violate --

13

when you violate 18 U.S.C. 242 through an excessive force

14

violation and you are sentenced by the - - under the

15

guideline applicable to that civil rights violation, the

16

heartland of typical cases must be defined with reference

17

to that civil rights violation and not assaults that are

18

committed by private persons which have very different

19

situations.

20

It was undisputed in the district court that the

21

kind of pursuit and eventual arrest that occurred in this

22

case was the sort of thing that police officers typically

23

encounter every day.

suspects who resist arrest, who use various forms of

2

so without stepping the line, over the line into excessive

3

force and constitutional violations which -QUESTION:

4

Mr. Dreeben, what would be an

5

6

the last portion of the last sentence of section (e),

7

where it says the courts of appeals shall give due

8

deference to the district court's application of the

9

guidelines to the facts?
Give me an example of where the district court

10
11

has applied the guidelines to the facts, and it's the kind

12

of application that the court of appeals should give

13

deference to.

14

MR. DREEBEN:

Certainly.

There is an adjustment

that applies under the guidelines to the base offense

had.

There are guidelines that address those issues.

20

There are application notes that give examples of how

21

those guidelines are to be applied, and when a district

They are in a sense disfavored.

4

account by the Sentencing Commission.

5

Departures were not intended to be the norm.
They are to be granted in

For almost all of the departure factors that the

6

district court relied on in this case, there was no

7

guideline that was applicable that gave him any sort of

8

guidance on how to adjust a particular sentence, and as a

9

result, it is only in a technical sense that the district

10
11

judge applied the guidelines at all.
What he really found was, incorrectly in our

12

view, that certain factors had not been taken into account

13

in the guidelines, and that other factors, though, were

14

not only unusual but that they should result in a

15

departure from the sentence, such as the fact that the

16

defendants in this case had been tried in a California

17

court for assault and acquitted.

18

And the Federal Government then made a

19

determination that there was probable cause to believe

20

that they had committed Federal civil rights violations,

21

and they should therefore be tried for those, and that

22

kind of a factor is clearly not something that's taken

23

into account in the guidelines in any sort of explicit

sense, but in our view it's the sort of unusual factor

The fact that the

There are differences

For example, if he had huge expenses,

monetary expenses, might not that bear on the amount of

Let me make a distinction with

in another jurisdiction I believe that they have already

been punished for their offenses in a way that mitigates

the need to punish them here.

relied on two other factors, the fact that they would lose

their jobs, and that they might be abused in prison, under

its further punishment rubric.

7

The district court instead

For this factor, the district court made a

8

categorical qualitative judgment that it raised a specter

9

of unfairness for the defendants to be tried in two

10

proceedings, and in our view that raises a pure question

11

of law.

12

Can a district court say, it is unfair for the

13

United States to attempt to vindicate Federal civil rights

14

laws by bringing an independent prosecution?

15

To allow district courts to use such words as, I

16

think this was unfair, is a wholesale invitation to the

17

kind of unguided, disparate sentencing that Congress

18

intended to remedy through the - -

19

QUESTION:

But the idea -- the idea of the

guidelines, I think, is to get sentences that are fair,

and if the judge, in fact, gives his reasons, isn't --

don't you then turn -- I mean, I'm more interested in the

This is outside the guideline range, right?

QUESTION:

It tells us

Yes.

So we have one of those before us,

and then say, is it unreasonable?

That's the word they

10

use, and when the court of appeals decides whether it is

11

unreasonable, it should have regard for the reasons that

12

the district court gives as well as the purposes of

13

punishment.

14

So my belief is, and I want you to respond if

15

I'm not right, that that is a rather general framework

16

within which courts of appeals can work out principles

17

over time on the basis of what is unreasonable, and that

they ought to give particular consideration to the

expertise of the district courts in telling us at least

initially what is unusual and what isn't.

Yes, right.

Except at the beginning the

prohibited from taking into account.

Doesn't it say that right at the

true that a district court can make a mistake in believing

a case is unusual based on a factor that, in fact, the

20

commission did consider.

21

But the important point for us here, I think, is

that the court went on to say that the second

second step.

Is the resulting sentence an unreasonably

high or low departure from the relevant guidelines
sentencing range?
3742(f) (2) .

If so, a remand is required under

That's at page 202.

What Williams did was draw a distinction between
errors of law that can infect a departure and the question
of whether it is unreasonable, which the Williams court
made clear is unreasonably high or unreasonably low, and I
would agree with you entirely that once a district court
relies on a permissible factor that is legally within its
ken to consider in departing, that the extent of the
departure is subject to deferential review on appeal under
the reasonableness component of the statute, and it
probably will not be often set aside unless the district
court explicitly regards some form of guidance that the
Sentencing Guidelines themselves give.
But it is not the case that simply because a
factor was not given adequate consideration by the
Sentencing Commission that the courts have found that it
thereby licenses district courts to depart.

One factor

that is, I think, very clear in this case is the one that
we've been talking about with respect to the specter of
unfairness resulting from dual prosecutions.
Certainly, the commission did not consider that,

but that does not mean that it justifies a departure, and

2

the question of whether it does or does not justify a

3

departure, namely whether we are right or wrong, is

4

clearly a question of law that should not be within the

5

bounds of district courts to resolve differently.

6

QUESTION:

What do you say about petitioner's

7

contention that that is no different from the level of

8

charging offense?

9

Maybe the court shouldn't have used the word

10

unfair, but where a court departs because it thinks that a

11

lesser offense should have been charged?

12

MR. DREEBEN:

13

QUESTION:

That is --

It's perfectly lawful for the

14

Government to make the higher charge, but in fact the

15

court thought it was unfair, use whatever word you like.

16

Why is that any different from this?

17

MR. DREEBEN:

We would appeal, and I think we

18

would prevail, on arguing that it is not the function of

19

the court of appeals to criticize the Government's

20

exercise of prosecutorial discretion in determining what

21

the charge is.

22

We have had cases that are almost exactly like

23

that, where defendants have claimed, in the District of

24

Columbia, that the United States Attorney's Office could

25

have brought this case across the street in the superior

court, and if they had done that, the defendant would only

2

be exposed to the sentence of 2 years.

3

But because the United States Attorney exercised

4

charging discretion to bring the case in Federal court,

5

the defendant was subject to a mandatory minimum of 5

6

years, or 10 years, or what-have-you, and district courts

7

have departed downwards, and the court of appeals has

8

reversed that as a matter of law, because it intrudes upon
the discretion of the Government to make a selection as to

10

what charges it will bring in court.

So you simply contest the factual

accuracy of the contention --

disagree with me on that, but I would suggest that if the

Court does so, it is disagreeing with me on an issue of

law which should be for the Court to resolve de novo and

not for a district court to be able to have the right to

In our view, those are the kinds of issues that

under a guidelines sentencing system should be resolved

consistently, and those kinds of issues arise with

remarkable frequency.

QUESTION:

We cite it -They won't be resolved consistently.

8

I mean, let us not exaggerate the kind of consistency

9

you're going to get.

Even if you decide it's a

permissible factor, you're going to have some judges who

are going to say, in my courtroom -- I know it's

12

permissible, but in my courtroom I'm not going to use it.

13

MR. DREEBEN:

14

QUESTION:

That's correct.

You're going to have a great deal of

15

divergence in the district courts anyway, so I mean, let

us not paint the picture that we're going to get uniform

nationwide sentencing.

18

MR. DREEBEN:

19

QUESTION:

We certainly aren't.
No, I --

Because merely -- merely -- the fact

20

that we pronounce something to be permissible does not

21

make it mandatory, and as long as it's permissible but not

22

mandatory, you're going to get a lot of variation.

23

MR. DREEBEN:

I think that is a fair statement.

25

between competing values.

There is a recognition that the district courts

1

should have discretion imposing sentences within the

sentencing ranges themselves, or one particular district

4

judge may say, I always sentence drug mules at the bottom

5

of the range, and another district judge will say, I

always put them at the top of the range, and that was

that that has become clear through some of the questions

from the Court.

We think that the proper approach is for a court

recognized to be permissible under something close to a de

MR. DREEBEN:

Well -At pages 26 and 27 of our brief we

set out the legislative history that accompanied --

5

QUESTION:

Well, you're saying that the

6

legislative history overrides the language that Congress

7

enacted?
MR. DREEBEN:

8

9

No, but I'm saying that in order

to apply a guideline to the facts one must first know

10

legally what that guideline means, and that raises a

11

question of law which should be resolved de novo.
To take an example in this case, the defendants

12

13

contended that they can defend, on appeal, the district

14

court's determination to depart under the victim

15

misconduct guideline, 5K2.10, because Rodney King's

16

misconduct substantially contributed to provoking their

17

offense conduct.

18

That's their contention.

Our reading of the district court's opinion and

19

the court of appeal's reading of the district court's

20

opinion is that the district court didn't really find

21

that.

22

Rodney King's misconduct in sending the police on a chase

23

through the streets of Los Angeles and eventually stopping

24

and acting in a way that led them to believe he was not

25

submitting to arrest and engaging in an attempt to escape,

What the district court found is that but for

1

but for those events, the defendants never would have been

2

put in the position where they engaged in the

3

constitutional violation of wilfully using excessive

4

force, which they ultimately did.
Our point of view on that is that but-for

5
6

causation is not the kind of provocation that that

7

guideline contemplates.

8

could be wrong about it, but we believe it's a question of

We could be right about that, we

law.
If ultimately, however, a court were to

10
11

correctly construe the guideline and to understand that it

12

did not mean that but-for causation was alone enough, and

13

it then went through and applied the factors to the

14

specific facts of the case, that is the kind of

15

determination that should get some sort of deference on

16

appeal.

17

So we are not seeking wholly to remove

18

sentencing discretion from district courts either in the

1

decision whether to depart from the guidelines when

20

there's a permissible factor or in the way that they

21

sentence within the guidelines.

22

guidelines contemplate a regime under which two things

23

will happen.

But we do think that the

24

One is, the law will be clarified in the court

25

of appeals, and then the Sentencing Commission can react

contemplated.

And that is a

5

And second, to provide a common law development

6

of how the recognized departure factors should be applied

7

in a particular case, so that a district court sitting in

New York doesn't think that it's unusual family

10

3 and you've been sentenced to a 10-year drug offense and

11

it was your first-time offense, while a different district

12

judge says no, as a matter of law that can't possibly be

13

unusual.

14

In our view what the courts of appeals should do

»

is review the decided cases that come to them, which is a
16

very small fraction of the departures to begin with, and

17

then attempt to harmonize the cases and make the facts of

18

the decided cases reconcilable with each other.

19

It may be that in carrying out that task the

20

courts of appeals will apply limited deference at first

21

until they gain enough experience.

after they chart the particular area by deciding enough

cases, there will be little law left to develop, and in

anyone could come up with a system that would produce

This case is unusual.

Do courts of appeals owe deference to taking the
case out of the usual box and into the special box?
MR. DREEBEN:

I think that they do not, Justice

5

Ginsburg, and I can give you examples of why I think, they

6

should not do that.

7

Many of the determinations of what constitutes

legal requirements that are applicable to sentencing that

Yes, but why doesn't that argue for

12

the answer that sometimes it does and sometimes it

13

doesn't, sometimes it reveals a clear issue of law,

sometimes it reveals a mixed issue which would get a more

deferential standard?

16

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I agree with you that there

17

are two classes of cases, Justice Souter, although for the

18

reasons I've stated I think that the theory of the

19

sentencing guideline system requires that appellate courts

make an effort to harmonize the departure --

QUESTION:

That's true, but I thought the theory

also was that you'd build on the experience of district

I mean, how is a court of appeals supposed to

Is there a statute book or a law book where you

closer to the kind of example that the Court considered in

Rivera itself.
Are typical needs to make restitution, part of

4

the heartland of embezzlement cases, such that the fact

5

that the defendant will be put in prison and have more

6

difficulty making restitution constitutes a ground for

7

departure?

8

9

The court of appeals in that case correctly, in
our view, said obviously not, because in the typical

10

embezzlement case it's fairly clear that you're going to

11

have the need for some restitution, and it's obvious that

12

it would be far more difficult to make restitution if

13

you're in prison, so the question of whether typical

14

restitution needs are within the heartland was resolved as

15

one of law.

Then the court of appeals would examine that and

give that whatever deference was appropriate because of

the superior feel of the district court with respect to

the facts of that case that made it unusual.

6

The Government is presenting here a sharply

7

discrete and different view of how the Sentencing

8

Guidelines, the Sentencing Commission, the district courts

9

and the appellate courts ought to work.

10

The Sentencing Commission believes that unless

11

it has -- because it is the delegee of legislative

12

authority from Congress, unless it has taken factors off

13

the table, it intends the district courts to look at those

14

factors, explain them, and then when they're abused, when

15

there's an abuse of discretion, that can be corrected in a

16

specific case by an appellate court or it can be corrected

17

in gross by the Sentencing Commission, which examines and

18

processes all of those departure decisions and decides

whether it's necessary to amend the guidelines, and it
