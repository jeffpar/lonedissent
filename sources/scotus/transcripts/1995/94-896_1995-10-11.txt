ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. FREY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
When an automobile comes off the assembly line

11

it has to be transported to the location where it's

12

distributed.

13

sometimes suffers some damage and BMW, like other

14

manufacturers, has means at hand to restore the car to

15

factory condition as best they can using the same

16

techniques that would be used in the factory if the same

17

incident happened in the factory parking lot.

18

In the course of that happening, it

The question arises, when this happens, whether

19

or under what circumstances there might be an obligation

20

or it might be good business practice to inform the

21

dealers and prospective purchasers of the automobile that

22

there has been work done on a repair or refinishing work.

23

Now, BMW looked at this question in 1983, and

24

the way they went about that was to examine the various

25

State laws that were on the books then that addressed the

which was to make disclosure, or at least not to sell

without disclosure, any car that had had repairs or

conduct or the defendant's state of mind or something of

that sort?

Absolutely, and there's no question,

policy and there was no question of intent --

Well, again, do we assume --

MR. FREY:

You can assume --

-- here that the evidence of conduct

out of State properly was admissible?
MR. FREY:

You can assume that, yes.

That's

what the Alabama supreme court held --

just the egregiousness of what happened to the plaintiff

could the jury properly have awarded the $4 million in

punitives based on conduct in Alabama alone?

9

11

MR. FREY:

No.

I'm going to argue that they

couldn't, but that is a different argument.
There are two separate issues in this case.

The

12

first issue is whether BMW was punished for non-Alabama

13

conduct, conduct to which Alabama law does not extend, but

14

punished under Alabama law; if so, whether that was

15

improper --

This case I think, Justice O'Connor,

highlights what is more submerged in a lot of other cases,

MR. FREY:

The court had already ruled that that

No.

No, but I think --

fact Mr. Bolt, counsel for Dr. Gore, said they wanted to

2

use it on damages.
Now, I understand that there are different ways

3
4

in which it can be used, but because the Yates trial had

5

already been held, and it had been used precisely in the

6

way it was used here, and that was called to the attention

7

of the court, I can't see that we had to do more, and

8

besides --

QUESTION:

But Mr. Frey, even if you were right

10

about what the record would reveal, and even if we can

11

pass over that there was no objection to the statement

12

that was made, the Alabama supreme court itself said, such

13

evidence may not be considered in setting the size of the

14

civil penalty.

15

MR. FREY:

I agree, and I am willing to accept

16

that as the premise and proceed to the question, which is

17

really the question we presented, whether the use of that

18

evidence to set the size of the civil penalty was properly
i

19

remedied by the reduction of the punitive damages award

20

from $4 million to $2 million.

21

QUESTION:

May I just ask you one question

22

before you get into that?

You have argued, as I recall,

23

that one of the aspects of the error was that Alabama was

24

allowing the jury to punish for conduct which was lawful

25

in the States in which it took place and that, as I

2

adopted its 3-percent cost policy it was complying with

3

the most stringent of out-of-state laws.

MR. FREY:

I don't -- I believe it is true --

the situation is this.
QUESTION:

There were statutes --

Well, let me just tell you what my

question is, then --

8

MR. FREY:

Okay.

9

QUESTION:

My question is, in those States in

10

which -- which had adopted this 3-percent rule, is it also

11

the case, as counsel on the other side have claimed, that

12

the common law fraud action was preserved and any

13

plaintiff in any of those other States could still have

14

brought a common law fraud action based upon repairs,

15

undisclosed repairs, even though they did not amount to

16

3 percent of the cost?

17

MR. FREY:

Well, the answer to that is, the

18

action might not have been dismissed for lack of

19

jurisdiction or preemption, but the action would have

20

been, I believe, bound to fail.

21

Now, let me say this.

First of all, at the time

22

of the sale of the car to Dr. Gore, there had not been a

23

single suit brought anywhere in the United States on the

24

theory that not disclosing paint refinishing is fraud --

25

by the manufacturer is fraud at all, let alone in a State

that had a statute that says here is the standard under

2

our Deceptive Trade Practices Act, and then you comply

3

with that standard and then we're going to go ahead and

4

not only find you liable for any damage that may have been

5

suffered but find_you -- but punish you.
Now, there are --we cite in our brief a case

6

7

from Louisiana which held that because the amount of the

8

refinishing exceeded the statutory threshold, there was a

9

cause of action, and I have a case from Wisconsin that

10

was - QUESTION:

11

Did you understand the court's

12

reasoning to be that had it not exceeded it would have

13

been no fraud cause of action?

14

MR. FREY:

I think that was implicit --

15

QUESTION:

Okay.

16

MR. FREY:

-- in the fact that their decision

17

turned on whether or not it exceeded it.
QUESTION:

18
19

Is there -- I take it that's the

extent of the out-of-state discussion of the subject.
MR. FREY:

20

There's a case called Tesh v. Best

21

Motors, decided by the court of appeals in Wisconsin on

22

August 15, 1995, and the cite I have is 1995 Westlaw

on that.

something slightly Kafkaesque about saying, this is the

3 percent.

on the evidence of compliance with that statute -- solely

on the evidence of conduct that complies with that

what you infer from the conduct -- holding somebody liable

It's not material, which is what the current

QUESTION:

Well, it's not -- why is it

11

Kafkaesque?

12

not going to provide the administrative machinery of the

13

State to go after these dealers unless the dereliction

14

reaches a certain point, but if any individual who has

15

been defrauded wants to go after them for the amount of

16

his loss, the individual is free to do it?

17

I mean, can't a State simply say, look, we're

MR. FREY:

Well, I guess -- I guess my problem

18

with this is that if virtually every State that has

19

considered this conduct has found that there -- that in a

20

statute, has set a statutory threshold -- those statutes

21

are passed to balance the interests of consumers, and

22

having information that's important to them, with the

23

interests of the business community in doing business free

24

from restrictions that may increase costs or have other

25

adverse effects.

of Alabama should have instructed the jury that so long as

the damage did not reach this 3-percent threshold that as

8

a matter of law it could not be considered as --

MR. FREY:

No.

We're not saying that to this Court.

argument to us?
«

15

MR. FREY:

No.

No.

The argument -- on this

16

particular point, the argument about the lack of any

17

notice that this conduct was unlawful, and there was no

18

notice in any judicial decision, any statute, or any

19

regulation anywhere in the United States that this conduct

20

would be considered fraud, but the only argument I'm

21

making here is that that bears on the reprehensibility of

22

the conduct when you're assessing whether it's excessive.

23

Now, for purposes of my argument about

24

extraterritorial punishment, it does not matter, because

25

the problem here is that Alabama law was applied, and I

that Alabama had no business regulating.

QUESTION:

Alabama law was applied to conduct

Mr. Frey, I think that that argument

is not genuinely in the case, and let me tell you why.
There's a statement made by the lawyer.

It's

7

not in the judge's charge.

8

that was wrong.

The Alabama supreme court says

The jury determined liability.

The

10

and painstaking review of the record, $2 million is an apt

11

award, and that's what we set.

12

Shouldn't we, as a Federal court, give the

13

Alabama supreme court the respect of assuming that once it

14

recognized the extraterritorial computation was no good,

15

it then set what it considered a permissible award without

16

regard to any extraterritorial multiplier?

17

MR. FREY:

Well, but the issue we're raising is

18

that we believe the Constitution prohibits it from doing

19

that, and the reason we believe that -i

20

QUESTION:

Let's just assume that the Alabama

21

supreme court said the jury has determined liability.

22

as judges, are determining amount, and the amount we as

23

judges arrive at has nothing to do with multiplier based

24

on out-of-state sales, it has to do with what happened

25

inside Alabama and the amount we set for that is

the enhanced penalty is not a further punishment for prior

crimes which may be considered, and why do we not look at

the Alabama rule as simply saying Alabama says if you've

done it in other States, you better watch it here, because

6

we're going to sock you hard as a result of it?

MR. FREY:

I have no problem -- I think this was

Justice O'Connor's question in the beginning.

I'm not

9

here saying that Alabama cannot consider that conduct to

10

enhance the punishment that should be imposed for every

11

plaintiff who sues, not just Dr. Gore, and it's an issue I

12

want to talk about which is very important that I'm afraid

13

I'm not going to get to, but -- but you have to decide --

14

there is a difference -- the Witte case that Justice

15

O'Connor wrote for the Court last year recognized that

16

there is a difference between punishing for the tort that

17

is being adjudicated and enhancing the punishment for that
i

18

based on other conduct, and punishing for the other

19

conduct.

20

Now, the Alabama supreme court was quite clear,

MR. FREY:

1

I have two separate arguments, and I

2

need to be clear about this.

The first argument has to do

3

with the remedy if there was a constitutional violation in

4

the way the punishment was measured.

5

the constitutionally maximum amount an adequate remedy?

And I'd * like to read to the Court from a case

called Hicks v. Oklahoma at 447 U.S. 345, where the Court

said, had the members of the jury been correctly

instructed in the this case, they could have imposed any

sentence of not less than 10 years.

That is, they could

11

have imposed a sentence of less than the one they did.
Then the Court said, it is argued that all that

12

13

is involved in this case is the denial of a procedural

14

right of exclusively State concern.

15

State has provided for the imposition of criminal

punishment in the discretion of the trial jury, it is not

I'd like to begin by rehearsing a little bit

first question that's presented in the petitioner's brief.

BMW now concedes that that denial was correct, the

2

evidence was in fact admissible.

3

The parties went to trial.

They were admitted,

4

and then in closing argument counsel made the unfortunate

5

statement which the Alabama supreme court thought created

6

an improper issue for the jury.

7

BMW did not, as Justice Ginsburg observed -- BMW

8

did not object to that.

If it had objected to that, under

9

Alabama law, as the supreme court has told us it is in

10

Alabama, the Judge either would have had to give a

11

corrective instruction to the jury which said, look only

12

at Alabama sales,-1 or, if the judge had refused to give

13

that correction, they would have been entitled to a new

14

trial, not to a remittitur.

15

Under Alabama law, if there is a judicial error

16

that affected the outcome, Alabama will not remit, it will

give the defendant a new trial.

8

9

Each of them is a case where the

The only thing that was being complained about
was that the amount the jury brought in exceeded the

10

maximum amount that could be justified for punishment and

11

deterrence, what are called in the jargon mere

12

excessiveness cases, and in that context the Alabama

13

supreme court has said, when the only problem we have is

14

that the jury's verdict is higher than could be justified,

15

we reduced to the maximum that would be justified, and the

inference was draton in BMW's brief -- and as I say, and I

be what they did here as well.

MR. GOTTESMAN:

QUESTION:

14

MR. GOTTESMAN:

there because they're saying that what made this one

that we have determined the award without considering the

Two things are striking.

1

One is that they

2

didn't say -- this language is pretty standard in their

3

cases, we reduce to the maximum amount, and we don't find

4

it here.

i

5

And the second thing is that when we realized

6

this and followed up on it we found one other Alabama case

7

where, because of peculiarity of posture, the court had

8

before it a remittitur where there was error.

9

in that case was found to be genuine bias by the jury.

The error

10

That case was the Harmon case at 525 Southern 2d

11

411, and it seems clear from the face of that opinion that

12

in that case where there was a tainted jury verdict

13

Alabama supreme court did not remit to the maximum

14

possible amount but to something less than that, because

15

it said, since this was a tainted award, the plaintiff, if

it rejects this remittitur, will not be bound to this as

the maximum that it can seek, so they plainly didn't think

they were imposing the maximum.

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, in the case that we cite

in this section of our brief, Clemons v. Mississippi, this

Court had a similar problem.

5

It didn't know exactly what the State court had

6

done as between two alternatives, one of which would have

been constitutionally okay, and the other of which would

have been constitutionally troublesome, and what the Court

Now, I can't tell you for sure, because they didn't tell

2

us what the elements were that led them to the $2 million,

but this record gives a basis for believing that there

were hundreds of cars in Alabama that were sold that were

repainted.

I'll come to that in a second.
And then secondly, I'll address the other

implications that would flow even if it were only 14.

Incidentally, as to the question of whether

everybody can do the same thing, the answer is no.

10

Alabama -- remember that punitive damages are not just to

punish for past acts, but to deter future acts.

that cars would continue to come into Alabama, because

did you make to assure that these repainted cars wouldn't

another, and he said, we did nothing about that.
What's most interesting -- so at best what they

were saying was, okay, we've been caught.

We promise from

12

now on we will reduce the amount of fraud that we commit

in Alabama, because what they weren't willing to say is,

we will disclose, because they couldn't just disclose in

Alabama without disclosing nationwide.

16

they -- even when they wanted to fix this problem, they

17

couldn't fix it by disclosing it in Alabama because, since

All right, and you have two prongs to

there some procedural aspect of due process that says when

there is no obvious relationship between damages and

minimal harm, when historically it can't be justified, at

8

least the court has a procedural obligation to explain

some rational theory, maybe a little stronger than a

explained to the court, we only got discovery for portions

where, you know, particular places where they had them.

3

What they got were 5,856 repainted cars --

4

that's in the record -- of which, 983 involved repainting

5

that cost more than $300, and counsel said, now, we don't

6

want to -- to the jury, we don't want to bombard you with

7

6,000 of these, so we'll give you the 983 that are more

than $300 of repainting, and that's where --of those 983,

14 were Alabama cars, so we don't -- there's no evidence
