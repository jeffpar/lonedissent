ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER A. SMITH, JR.

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

13

MR. SMITH:

14

it please the Court:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, may

15

The question in this case is whether Congress

16

intended that Federal agencies who discriminate against

17

disabled people in violation of section 504 of the

18

Rehabilitation Act are to be subject to damages for those

19

violations.

20

It's undisputed in this case that in fact the

21

Government did violate section 504.

It's also undisputed

22

that Petitioner Griff Lane was caused significant damages

23

by that violation.

24

contained the parties' stipulation that his damages were

25

some $75,000 --

In fact, the paper before the Court

QUESTION:

1

I see the petitioner's name,

2

Mr. Smith, is James Griffin Lane.

3

Lane, is that how you refer to him?
MR. SMITH:

4
5

When you say Griff

Yes, Your Honor.

I've always called him.

That's the name

Sorry.

The $75,000 to Mr. Lane include his out-of-

6

7

pocket expenses and his lost earnings for the 2 years he

8

was improperly excluded from the Merchant Marine Academy.
Now, we understand that in deciding whether or

9
10

not Mr. Lane is going to be entitled to these damages, we

11

will have to meet the strict burden that this Court's

12

sovereign immunity cases have placed on us.

13

that in fact it was clear in the statute that Congress

14

intended these damages to be made available.

15

it is clear in the statute.

16

QUESTION:

We must show

We believe

Mr. Smith, may I refer you to the

17

statute, section 505(a)(2), dealing explicitly with

18

remedies?

19

statute that deals with remedies?

There is a section, is there not, of the

20

MR. SMITH:

21

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
And it says the remedies set forth in

22

title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 shall be

23

available to any person aggrieved under the statute, and

24

the civil title VI in includes compensatory damages, I

25

believe, is that right?

MR. SMITH:

2

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, that is correct.
And then it goes on and it says, any

3

person aggrieved by any act or failure to act by any

4

recipient of Federal assistance, or Federal provider of

5

such assistance.
Now, who is a Federal provider?

6

Is the

7

Department of Transportation a Federal provider of

8

assistance?
MR. SMITH:

9
10

Yes, Your Honor, it is, and we

believe -QUESTION:

11

Well, if it is, then does the statute

12

cover it and you don't have to go through all this

13

implication?

14

MR. SMITH:

Well, as we argued in our reply

15

brief, we believe even if you read 505(a)(2) alone, in

16

isolation, because the Department of Transportation is a

17

Federal provider --

18

QUESTION:

How do we know who's a Federal

19

provider?

20

amended to include any program or activity conducted by

21

any executive agency, it didn't refer to it as a Federal

22

provider, did it?

23

It's -- under the operative section that was

MR. SMITH:

It did not, Your Honor, and as we've

24

argued in our brief, we believe that Congress when it

25

amended 504 and also provided in 505(a)(2) for this -5

Can you give me a hand here and use

Are you talking

Is that what we're talking about?
Yes -794a(a)(2) would be the remedy

section, right?

8

MR. SMITH:

9

QUESTION:

10

I mean, maybe you work with the

That's correct.
And the general liability section

would be 794(a), right?

11

MR. SMITH:

That's correct also, Your Honor.

12

I'm looking, Justice Scalia, at pages 2 and 3 of

13

our brief, where all of these provisions are set out, and

14

I will use the U.S.C. cite for clarity.

15

We believe, Justice O'Connor, that because the

16

Department of Transportation is a Federal provider in the

17

sense that the Government is using it in its brief, that

18

is

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. SMITH:

Is there a definition anywhere?
There is not a definition that I'm

21

aware of, Your Honor, of Federal provider anywhere in the

22

statute.

23

If you were to treat Federal provider there as

24

simply an agency that extends funds to a non-Federal

25

recipient, then the Department of Transportation is

clearly a Federal provider, as the regulations we've cited

in our brief show.

3

highways, railroads, airports.

4
5
6

It provides funds, in that sense, for

Indeed, every departmental agency in the Federal
Government is a Federal provider in that sense.
QUESTION:

Would you call the Department of

7

Transportation a Federal provider with respect to the

8

Merchant Marine Academy?

9

MR. SMITH:

No, Your Honor, we would not,

10

because of this Court's decision in Paralyzed Veterans,

11

which indicates that funds that are actually provided to

12

an entity that the Federal Government manages itself,

13

which is what DOT does here, effectively, for the Merchant

14

Marine Academy, then the Merchant Marine Academy is not a

15

recipient of Federal financial assistance, but DOT would

16

remain a Federal provider for purposes of the question

17

Justice O'Connor was asking, but our view is that you

18

shouldn't read Federal provider in that narrow sense here.

19

We believe that what Congress intended at the

20

time it adopted 794a(a)(2) was to provide a remedy for the

21

new duty it had just imposed on the Federal Government in

22

what is now 504(a) of the Rehabilitation Act.

23

in 1978, Congress extended the application of 504 to

24

Federal agencies, or in this case executive agencies, and

25

at the same time it amended 505(a) (2), as Justice O'Connor

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

In 504(a)

1
2

said, to provide remedies.
We think the explanation of the difference in

3

wording that the Ninth Circuit provided in Doe is correct.

4

The amendment to 504 came from the House.

5

to 505(a)(2) came from the Senate, and the conference

6

report didn't make the two exactly coterminous.

7

The amendment

But to read this as intending a difference in

8

treatment between the two would mean that Congress imposed

9

a new duty on the Federal Government but then in the

10

remedy section provided no remedy, and at the same time,

11

that Federal provider means somethiNg different --

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, why is that so

3

extraordinary?

4

under 702 with its broad waiver of sovereign immunity,

5

nonmonetary relief, the idea of sovereign immunity being

6

waived as to relief other than monetary is hardly novel.

7

under the Administrative Procedure Act,

MR. SMITH:

Well, certainly, Your Honor, but I

8

would suggest to you there's no suggestion anywhere in the

9

statute, or in the legislative history, that Congress was

20

assuming that the APA was going to apply to the situation

21

precisely for the reason that we're here now.

22

QUESTION:

I'm not talking about the APA

23

applying, but is it -- am I not right that 702, in its

24

broad waiver of sovereign immunity, is hardly limited to

25

cases arising under the APA.

I thought that -- at least, there are several

1

2

decisions that are held that that's an all-purpose waiver.

3

MR. SMITH:

I believe that is right, Your Honor,

4

that wouldn't change the contention that I'm trying to

5

make here.

6

QUESTION:' Why wouldn't it --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. SMITH:

9

QUESTION:

It would -Sorry.
It would mean that there's always a

10

suit under the APA to get the Government to comply with

11

obligations imposed upon the Government by law.

12

Government is acting, you have a suit to review the

13

lawfulness of that Government action.

14

MR. SMITH:

15

QUESTION:

If the

I believe that is right, Your Honor.
Okay, so then the only question is,

16

is there in addition provided by this statute a suit for

17

money damages, which the APA does not provide?

18

MR. SMITH:

Does it not provide, and our

19

contention is what Congress is trying to do here was to

20

equalize the remedies available for all entities covered

21

by section 504, including the Federal Government, and that

22

is what it was doing in 504(a)(2), or 29 U.S.C.

23

794a(a)(2).

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, it's truly remarkable, then,

with the sections coming right in sequence, that different

language is used in 505(a)(2), 794a(a)(2), than the

section right before it.

3

same thing.

4

MR. SMITH:

You say, really, they mean the

Our contention is that they mean the

5

same thing, but our contention also is that if they don't

6

mean the same thing, that Federal provider is something

7

narrower, that we are still entitled to damages in this

8

case.
I mean, it's quite clear, and we understand the

9
10

Government's position to agree with us here, that whatever

11

Federal provider may mean, there is a damage remedy

12

available against it, which means that something more than

13

what the APA provides is provided for in 505(a)(2).

14
15
16

QUESTION:

Well, who's the Federal provider in

your case?
MR. SMITH:

The Federal provider in our case

17

is -- within the meaning we've now been discussing it,

18

Your Honor, is the Department of Transportation.

19

QUESTION:

But I thought a moment ago you said

20

that would not be the Federal provider with respect to the

21

Merchant Marine Academy.

22

MR. SMITH:

That'is right, Your Honor.

Our view

23

is that because 505(a)(2) subjects -- let me just -- the

24

language is, the remedies in title VI shall be available

25

to any person aggrieved by any act or failure to act by a

QUESTION:

I thought the academy discriminated.

13

QUESTION:

I thought the academy did that.

14

MR. SMITH:

Well, Your Honor, we, of course,

15

brought our action against all three levels here, and

16

because the Department of Transportation effectively

17

manages the Merchant Marine Academy through MARAD, which

18

is another intervening entity, DOT is ultimately

19

responsible in our view, which is why we brought the

20

action against the Secretary, for the conduct here.

decision of the Maritime Academy?

(800) FOR DEPO

1

MR. SMITH:

Presumably so, Your Honor.

We

2

actually submitted our papers, when we appealed the

3

decision of the academy, both to MARAD and to the Office

4

of the Secretary, and the resulting decision came from

5

MARAD upholding his exclusion.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, the distinction that

7

you're making, the -- you say that 502(a)(2), provider,

8

covers the Department of Transportation because it

9

provides, but in this particular case it's in its capacity

10
11

as executive agency, not as provider.
Under that reading, it would mean that a

12

Government agency that doesn't provide funds, that just

13

has its own operation, would not be responsible for money

14

damages, and that's an illogical way, I think, for

15

Congress to act.

16

as Government agency with respect to people under its

;L7

programs to be covered or it doesn't, but a line between

18

an agency that gives money and an agency that doesn't,

19

doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

20

Either they want the Government agency

MR. SMITH:

I agree with that, Your Honor.

21

That's why our first argument is that, in fact, Congress

22

intended a damage remedy to be available against the

23

discriminator itself.

24

damage remedy is available.

25

QUESTION:

When it's a Federal agency, a
When it's a recipient --

If you don't get that from the word,

1

Federal provider, in 502(a)(2), where do you get that

2

explicit waiver of damages, or clear waiver?

3

MR. SMITH:

Well, we get it in part from

4

505(a)(2), Your Honor.

5

Equalization Act of 1986, where Congress did two things.

6

It abrogated the sovereign immunity of the States, and

7

more important for our purposes, Congress made clear that

8

it wanted the remedies available for section 504 to be the

9

same for all defendants under section 504.

10

We also get it from the

That is, the remedies available against States

11

were to be the same as the remedies available against all

12

other entities, or to use the language of section 2 of 42

13

U.S.C. 2000d-7, the remedies shall be the same for a

14

violation in the suit, which is referring to a suit under

15

section 504, against any public or private entity other

16

than a State.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, can I suggest a different

18

reading of 794a(a)(2), and you tell me why it would not

19

make sense.

20

It seems to me the phrase, recipient of Federal

21

assistance, bears a fairly common meaning.

22

Federal assistance programs in which Federal money is

23

given to organizations which in turn act to help those in

24

need, and if such a person providing help to those in need

25

discriminates in violation of the act, you would have a

There are

And then it goes on to say, or Federal provider

of such assistance.

4

agency which provides money to the private agency which

5

makes the direct assistance discriminates in its provision

6

of funds by denying funds for handicapped facilities, for

7

example, you would have a claim against -- for damages

8

against that Federal agency.

9

That would mean that if the Federal

If you interpreted it that way, it would provide

10

a cause of action for money damages only with respect to

11

the money that the assistance program would have provided.

12

That's what the money damages would be.

3

It would make

perfect sense.

4

MR. SMITH:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. SMITH:

It -Why isn't that the way to read it?
It isn't clear in that case, Your

7

Honor, what the duty then is in 504(a), 794a, that the

8

Federal provider as you're now defining it was violating.

19

QUESTION:

The Federal provider cannot deny

20

funds to an otherwise eligible private provider of

21

assistance to the public on the ground that those funds

22

are going to be spent on handicapped facilities.

23

MR. SMITH:

24

QUESTION:

25

If that -If it's denied that, you know, this

is an extravagant expenditure, building this ramp for

1

wheelchairs or what-not is an extravagant expenditure, and

2

we will not provide funds for that, you would have a cause

3

of action against the Federal provider to get those funds.

4

MR. SMITH:

In that event, Your Honor, Congress

5

has imposed a duty on executive agencies not to

6

discriminate.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. SMITH:

9

QUESTION:

11

MR. SMITH:

13

But it's not provided the same

damage remedy for that kind of discrimination --

10

12

Yes.

Right.
-- as the kind you just now

described.
QUESTION:

Right, because it knew that, you

14

know, damages can get out of hand, especially against a

15

deep pocket like the Government, and the only kind of

16

damage actions we're going to allow are damage actions for

17

the amount of money that would have been provided under

18

the assistance program.

19

MR. SMITH:

Even if that reading is a plausible

20

one, Your Honor, and I think it is not because of the

21

anomaly of there being two kinds of obvious discrimination

22

and for one you're suggesting a remedy, a damage remedy is

23

provided and for the other not, I would still contend to

24

you that any doubt about Congress' intention on the point

25

you've just raised is resolved again by the Equalization

1

of Remedies Act.
QUESTION:

2

But that Equalization of Remedies Act

3

seems to me to be devoted primarily to making the States

4

liable in response to our Atascadero decision.

5

MR. SMITH:

I agree with that, Your Honor, that

6

that was the impetus for the 1986 act, but section 2 of

7

that act as we ready it, and we don't understand the

8

Government to deny this, section 2 of that act, by its own

9

terms, equalizes the remedies between the States, which we

10

know includes damages, with all other defendants who are

11

subject to a suit for a violation under all of the

12

statutes named in section 1.

13

QUESTION:

Well, but what it's saying, section 2

14

is saying is that you're going to have the remedies

15

available against a State that are available against other

16

entities, and you draw from that kind of a negative

17

inference that since damages are available against the

18

State, therefore they must be available against these

19

other public entities, too?
MR. SMITH:

20

Well, not a negative inference, Your

21

Honor.

I would say it's a positive one, because the

22

language of section 2 speaks of a suit against a State for

23

a violation of a statute referred to in section 1, which

24

includes section 504 that we've been talking about, and it

25

equalizes the remedy between a State on the one hand and

You're saying that all the -- remedies against all public

MR. SMITH:

It says the converse.

Well, Your Honor, if -- I would say

8

that any public entity here includes the Federal

Government.
QUESTION:

10

But your reading makes public and

11

private superfluous.

It didn't say, any other entity

whatsoever.

it has to refer to the United States is because the United

States is certainly an entity that is covered by section

QUESTION:

4

But even if it does, I don't know why

5

it falls from your -- anything further falls from your

6

argument than if the Federal Government does not have to

7

provide a general damages remedy, then by virtue of this

8

particular provision the State wouldn't have to provide

9

one.

10

I mean, it -- if -- you seem to say, because a

11

State has to provide one based on some independent ground,

12

that the Feds do, too, but it seems to me that on your

13

reading of (2), you can't go any further than saying, if

14

this were the basis for subjecting the States to damages,

15

then the States would not be subjected to a general damage

16

remedy because the National Government is not.

section 504, necessarily public entity in that phrase has

3

to include the Federal Government.

4

QUESTION:

I'm assuming that it does, but the --

5

what you refer to as being equalization, as I understand

6

the statute means that the States cannot provide less than

7

the other entities to whom they are compared.

8

It does not follow from that that if the State,

9

by virtue of one comparison, has to provide a damage

10

remedy, that another public entity, i.e., the United

11

States, must do the same thing.

12

MR. SMITH:

It just doesn't follow.

Well, if I follow you, Your Honor,

13

that would mean that we would have differing remedies, as

14

Justice Kennedy was suggesting, that the public and

15

private entity may be subject to, but if that were the

16

case, it's difficult for me to see how we are to choose

17

between them with regard to what remedies the State is

18

going to be subject to.

19

QUESTION:

Why isn't it just saying, you're

20

entitled to the best remedy there is, it's private entity

just as though public wasn't there.

there would be this remedy against a private entity, it

would be against the State.

Well, the answer to that, Your

7

Honor, is, as the Chief Justice pointed out, the purpose

8

of this provision was to respond to Atascadero.

9

Atascadero was premised in part on the fact that

10

nowhere in section 504 were States named at all as being

11

subject to the act.

12

QUESTION:

In the 1978 amendment -Wouldn't it be logical, though, even

13

if the trigger is a case that's dealing with State

15

well, we know the Feds are also immune, while we're

16

dealing with governmental immunity we should take care of

both?

18

MR. SMITH:

Well, they might have, Your Honor,

19

and of course, I wish they had, or I wouldn't be here now.

But from our position Congress didn't do that in

against every entity that's named in the language of the

2

statute, so sovereign immunity had already been waived for

3

the Federal Government at the time of the 1986

4

Equalization Act.

5

QUESTION:

Your argument is that this language

6

reflects the understanding by Congress that all public and

7

private entities were liable for money damages.

8

that's what your argument is.

9

I think

Not that it created liability for money damages,

10

but that that language there, suit against any -- in a

11

suit against any public or private entity other than a

12

State, it displays an acknowledgement by the Congress that

13

passed that that all public and private entities were

14

similarly suable.

15

It's not a trick question.

16

MR. SMITH:

17
18

This is --

No, no, I'm thinking.

I'm thinking.

I'm thinking before I answer, Your Honor.
I think the answer is yes, because Congress

19

wanted to treat all of them equally, and any public or

20

private entity, as that phrase is used there, refers to

21

all of the covered entities under section 504, which

22

includes the Federal Government.

MR. SMITH:

2

QUESTION:

Certainly.
Is your case helped at all by the

3

fact that it's recognized -- I think it's recognized that

4

back pay is permissible in a suit against the Government?

5

Does that help your case, or do we think of back pay as

6

being an equitable remedy?

7

MR. SMITH:

Well, we think it's helped, Your

8

Honor, because of the overall implausibility of the

9

proposition that Congress would have provided everything

10

that it did here, which is to say it provided that the

11

Federal Government would be subject to the action, that

12

attorney's fees would be available, that injunctive relief

13

would be available --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. SMITH:

16
17

Well, I guess what I'm saying is --- that back pay would be available,

but not damages.
QUESTION:

-- is the Government right in saying,

18

or at least in implying that back pay is simply an

19

equitable remedy?

20

MR. SMITH:

Well, I think now, Your Honor,

21

because the Court dealt with that in the Franklin case,

22

that very distinction that was being drawn, and said the

23

effect of the ruling there was to make the States liable

24

to pay money damages, even when it was called equitable

relief in the form of back pay.

appears to make a Federal provider liable?
MS. BRINKMANN:

Your Honor, for the several

agency that's providing funds.

As we explain in our brief, in fact, the courts

are not even in agreement on whether or not there's

implied cause of action for a Federal funding agency.

in Cannon.

However, we do believe that there would be a
remedy against a Federal fund provider in that situation

It's because you say no damages are

I think the question would be,

Your Honor, the way to analyze it is to see what remedies

10

are available under title VI, and I think calling it

11

damages, what makes me hesitate, I think it would be a

12

question, for example, under Bowen v. Massachusetts

13

whether or not there could be some monetary relief,

perhaps as an injunctive, requiring the agency either to

15

provide funds or not provide funds, but it's not a damages

So it's not saying -- 794a(a)(2) in

your view does not say that money damages are available.

1

Perhaps.

I think a really

2

significant feature of the act, Your Honor, that you raise

3

in my mind when you point that out is the expressed waiver

4

of compensatory damages that Congress enacted in 1991 for

5

section 501.
In the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Congress made

6

7

very clear that it was waiving damages, sovereign immunity

8

for compensatory damages for claims under section 501, and

9

it puts significant limitations on that waiver.
First of all, it's limited to intentional

discrimination, or in the case of a 501, a Rehabilitation

On the other hand, Congress may have wanted to
be more protective of the discrimination against the

standard that would be applied to them, so Congress

Congress didn't mean to restrict the remedy to the entity

the remedy by reference to the entity that is most liable?

Another thing I think that the Court should

focus on about the development of law that was the

was not clear until the Franklin Court, the Franklin

17

opinion from this Court in 1992, so even at the time that

that there were damages necessarily available against all

21

There were lower courts that had held that, but

those cases did not involve Federal executive agencies,

just wasn't at issue.

In fact, I think that that's a significant

factor.

different times that when these other provisions were

recipient, if it's told that the Federal provider believes

that the recipient is discriminating and funds are going

and that recipient would be a person aggrieved by an act

of the Federal provider and could invoke that provision.

And Congress was really trying to say, we're

going to treat section 504 for the Federal fund recipients

the same way we do title VI and title IX, but it did not,

Government wants to narrowly contain that, and it has no

explanation for why damages wouldn't be available under

the plain meaning of a(a)(2) in that circumstance.

But yet, it urges the Court to conclude that in

this one area, direct discrimination by executive

agencies, that Congress set out to withhold one kind of

relief only, money damages.
