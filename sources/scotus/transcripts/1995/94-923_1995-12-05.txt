I think we have here the

And I'd like to make one other point, just to

5

explain why we are here, and perhaps it reflects a rather

6

naive understanding of the Constitution, of the Equal

7

Protection Clause, but my impression has been that if

8

there were two water fountains over there, one of which

9

said African American, and another of which said, women,

10

and another over here which said male, and said white, and

if that in effect was here, with the signs, that I would

be perfectly entitled to go to any one of those four

fountains and drink the water.

classifications.

17

The water would be the

reflects a redistricting plan which, in effect, is a

19

racial classification. That's what this is about.

white districts.

Does it say that the people in those

districts can drink at either water fountain?

I would hope at least we could get

a majority, but in any event, it would seem to me what we

22

are saying is these signs, these labels should be removed.

23

Now, in order that there's no question about the

24

status and the standing of the plaintiffs and the

25

plaintiff intervenors, I should note that according to the

1

Court's determination the plaintiffs and the plaintiff

2

intervenors have established -- this is on page 110a --

3

have established that they are registered to vote in North

4

Carolina congressional elections and that the challenged

5

redistricting plan assigns them to vote in particular

6

electoral districts, at least in part because of their

7

race.

Which is to say that Professor Shimm is assigned
to the 12th District at least in part because of the

10

racial determination.

who are assigned to the 2nd District because of our race.

Mr. Everett, there is some

19

difference, isn't there, with respect to the standing of

the plaintiffs in this case with respect to one district

MR. EVERETT:

We would maintain, Your Honor,

23

that due to the ripple effect all these plaintiffs have

QUESTION:

Suppose --

12

QUESTION:

What about our decision in Hays?

13

mean, couldn't the plaintiffs there have made the same

14

argument about Louisiana, that it's a seamless web, and we

15

didn't accept that.

16

MR. EVERETT:

I don't believe they made it, as I

17

recall -- I was here at the argument -- and I don't think

18

it was articulated in that particular fashion, but our

19

position would be this, Your Honor, as a practical matter.

20

The 12th District, because of its inner penetration, is

21

essential to the plan.

22

there is no plan, and as a consequence, and since

23

Professor Shimm and Mrs. Shaw clearly have standing, it

really doesn't make much difference.

particular situation, given the inner penetration of the
plan, that would be true.

Including the aspects of the plan

that you claim are invalid with respect to other

15

MR. EVERETT:

We would think across the board in

16

this situation, and we would note this, Your Honor, that

17

the -- well, I will admit, Cherokee County, over here, up

18

into Tennessee, I'm not really saying that I'd have much

19

standing perhaps to challenge that, but as a practical

20

matter, everything in the middle and the eastern part of

21

North Carolina is so tied together as a practical matter

22

it is one plan.

It's a

1

One thing I would like to call to the Court's

2

attention, and we stress it in our brief because we think

3

it's important.

4

when we were here, and what's happened in between.

5

That is, what was said 2-1/2 years ago

When I argued the case 2-1/2 years ago the

6

counsel for the State appellee, and this is pointed out in

7

our brief on page 4, said this case is about the legal

8

significance of two facts.

9

General Assembly intentionally created two majority

10

11

First, the North Carolina

minority congressional districts.
Second, the General Assembly did so for the

12

purpose of complying with section 5 of the Voting Rights

13

Act and of securing preclearance of its congressional

14

reapportionment plan from the Attorney General of the

15

United States.

16

In response to a question from the Court, the

17

same counsel stated -- he's not here this time.

18

different counsel for the State, but he presumably spoke

19

with authority -- there's no dispute here over what the

20

State's purpose is.

21

characterize it legally, but we're not in disagreement

22

about what the State legislature was trying to do.

23

There's a

There's a dispute over how to

Then again, and this is quoted on page 27 of our

24

brief in the footnote, counsel for the State defendant

25

stated to the Court the determining factor in this case is

1

that North Carolina is subject to section 5 preclearance,

2

and then later, section 2 may, depending upon the

3

particular demographics and the situation of the State,

4

require majority minority districting, but once again,

5

that's not this case.
So we were here 2-1/2 years ago thinking the

6

7

case had to do with whether or not section 5 was involved,

8

and the State put forth what we characterized as the

9

Nuremberg defense.

The Department of Justice made us do

10

it.

11

wouldn't give us preclearance.

12

The Civil Rights Division made us do it.

They

And I was also here during the argument when the

13

Solicitor General was asked back in April this year about

14

the policy of the Department of Justice, and it seems very

15

clear from the findings made in the Hays case, the

16

original Hays case, from the findings in the Georgia case

17

which you're well familiar with, from everything about it,

18

that just as was said here to this very Court 2-1/2 years

19

ago and just as was admitted in the defendant's answer,

20

they did it in order to get preclearance.

21

What did they do?

They enacted this

22

constitutional monstrosity, which replaced another

23

constitutional monstrosity but a less aggravated

24

monstrosity.

25

They did it in order to get preclearance.

decision, actually, in summer of 1993, and we read about

2

the gerrymander, what the Court said, racial gerrymander,

3

strict scrutiny, we thought it was a fairly simple case.

4

Go back -- can we prove there's a racial gerrymander?

5

course we can.

Everything else spoke for itself.

submission in Chapter 7 says the overriding purpose of the

8

State, the State of North Carolina, is to create these

districts and to obtain preclearance.

So - - but there are some very ingenious counsel

11
12

on the other side, and then we learned that it wasn't

really a racial gerrymander, oh, no, and it wasn't just

Mr. Everett, may I ask you this

configuration was a means to comply with section 2?

I'm asking you whether they're

MR. EVERETT:

Well,

I'd say -

One says the motive -- the motive the

13

first time was to obtain section 5 preclearance, period.

14

Assume that.

15
16

I'm assuming that.

MR. EVERETT:

That's the only question,

question.

My question wasn't whether they had two

2

different intents.

3

intent was in fact to get a section 5 preclearance, and we

4

know from Shaw that that is not adequate, is there

5

anything inconsistent with saying it is nonetheless

6

justifiable now, because in fact it was necessary to avoid

7

a section 2 violation and hence --

My question was, if we assume that the

8

Are those two

propositions inconsistent?

11

MR. EVERETT:

12

are very inconsistent.

Your Honor, let me --

QUESTION:

Let me say in this context they

No, they're not.

I mean, the one

goes to intent and the other goes to the pure fact of

whether it was necessary, not whether it was intended.

necessary, that there's no other thing you could have

done -- I think that's a hard thing to prove, but -- that

no other configuration could possibly have been adopted

QUESTION:

But you're -- so you're saying that

the only justification at this stage is the justification

of their original intent, and we've now -- this Court has

found that that intent, i.e. conform to -- get section 5

Is that your position?

MR. EVERETT:

of equal protection and to protect the constitutional

rights of us voters, yes, that should be disregarded.
QUESTION:

Okay.

The case goes back.

The court

says, unconstitutional.

Go back and come up with a new

that the object to avoid a section 2 violation as a matter

of law may not be considered as a justification under

MR. EVERETT:

4

We do not believe, Your Honor,

5

that it constitutes a compelling interest, given the

QUESTION:

Is the reason for your answer

essentially that section 2 is unconstitutional?
MR. EVERETT:

Our position would be that

13

section 2 as properly construed and narrowed is probably

14

constitutional, but that certainly to use it as a vehicle

15

for compelling majority minority districts is

16

unconstitutional.

QUESTION:

How about a voluntary majority

saying that, that if the avowed purpose is to create a

21

majority minority district no matter how compact it is, if

22

people are honest about that's what they're trying to

accomplish, that that's unconstitutional?

that's the label, then that in our view at least, right or

4

obviously -QUESTION:

5

Am I right that there are many

6

congressional districts, many State districts across the

7

country where people said exactly that, we want a majority

minority district, so on your reasoning, a good deal of

9

the redistricting was unconstitutional.
MR. EVERETT:

10

On our reasoning a good deal of

11

the redistricting that followed the 1990 census was

12

unconstitutional because it is result-oriented in a manner

13

of labeling just like labeling the water fountains in my

14

example.

15

QUESTION:

Well, that -- would you take that

position even in circumstances in which to accomplish the

voters are registered, Democrat, Republican, independent,

Dixiecrat, whatever it might be, and the lines are drawn

nonracial data.

20

MR. EVERETT:

Your Honor, we think the goal is

impermissible.

Let me analogize this.

I can see the --

22

well, if you want to have Democrats control or

23

Republicans, or whatever it is, look at the registration

24

of those, you may know that there's a heavy Democratic

25

registration, say in North Carolina where 95 percent of

the African Americans are registered as black.
You may know that where there's a 95 --a heavy

2

3

Democratic registration there probably is a very

4

substantial African American population.

5

what I am concerned about, and perhaps this is because of

6

my reading or misreading of the peremptory challenges

7

cases, my understanding is that if I look at a juror, I

8

have a peremptory challenge, and I say, that juror is

9

black, therefore I don't want him in this particular case,

So what?

But

10

or that juror is a woman and I don't want her in that

11

particular case, and I use a stereotype, and I use a

12

classification, that is wrong.

13

If, on the other hand, as in the Hernandez case

14

where you were dealing, as I recall, with peremptory

15

challenges, I say, this Hispanic may be interpreting for

16

himself or herself the testimony being given, rather than

17

going through an interpreter, then I can challenge him

19

It's -- as we view it, and we perhaps take

20

Hirabayashi and the later cases too seriously, but we

really take it very seriously that racial classifications

are odious and are subject to stricture.

Well, I mean, are you distinguishing

7

whether it's a whole district, or part of a district, or

what is -- I'm trying -- what are you distinguishing?

MR. EVERETT:

Our distinction is in terms of

10

purpose, very much like the Batson situation, where, if

11

there is a purpose to do it on a racial basis or an ethnic

12

basis or a religious basis or a gender basis, then that is

impermissible.

14

Now, hopefully -- hopefully, when this Court

15

makes that message loud and clear that this is

impermissible unless it can survive strict scrutiny,

Our secondary position is that it

the section 5 denial of preclearance tainted everything,

that just as the State represented when it came up here

United States would walk into a district court with this

3

that entitle us to remedial relief under section 2 of the

5

The other reason, Your Honor, why that is not an

issue in this case is because no one in the North Carolina

General Assembly believed that they were creating these

Now, we believe, Your Honor, aside from the fact

that the State did not comply with what is stated in

Croson and Wygant, that they have to have substantial

9

racism evidence at the time that they adopt a racial-

10

based remedy, assuming that they had done that, Your

Honor.

12

The only defense that they have in this case is

13

if the Court adopts the notion that you may place a

14

remedial district somewhere else in North Carolina besides

15

the part of the State where the violation has been proven,

16

area of law, and it ought to be a novel concept under

as you pointed out, one could be done in that part of the

14

State and the other in the other part of the State, and

15

the only reason that they're in a different place is for

16

incumbency protection reasons, and that latter reason has

17

nothing to do with race, and if you say that you can't do

18

that, then you're saying that you can't do it when black

districts are involved but you could do it when white

an impossible one to maintain.

and if that can be pursued, let's say with political data

Don't you concede that?

MR. FARR:

No, Your Honor, I don't concede that.

QUESTION:

Then tell me why not.

MR. FARR:

Well, if I understood your question,

you were saying, and Justice Scalia, we believe it's a

very difficult case to prove a section 2 violation, and I

hope I have a chance to explain that before I sit down,

principle is incumbency protection, you are saying, well,

you're asking for a change in Miller.

QUESTION:

MR. FARR:

Your Honor, I think there's a great

3

distinction, because when you're talking about political

subdivisions or county lines, you're talking about neutral

criteria, and I believe that the Court discussed those

6

issues as a frame of reference to show in a case involving

7

circumstantial evidence whether or not you could prove the

8

intent element of the Miller claim.

9

With incumbency protection that is a far more

10

subjective factor, and Justice Souter, drawing a majority

minority district has to be done for a compelling

12

governmental interest, and we would suggest that doing it

to protect an incumbent is not compelling.

4

MR. SPEAS:

No, Your Honor, but we think in this

me if I'm wrong because we've used it in slightly

different formulations in different cases.

10

MR. SPEAS:

11

QUESTION:

Yes.
But I thought that narrow tailoring

12

meant that there is a wrong, and that the remedy has to be

as closely designed to cure that evil as possible, and

My understanding of your prior

of narrow tailoring.

we're operating not in a vacuum, but in a situation where

the objective that you're urging upon us, but it certainly

isn't clear as a matter of principle or logic that this is

We've gone through periods where we know,

10

through the legislation that's been passed in Congress,

11

where the interests of black people haven't been

represented.

13

Congress sought through the legislation in 1982

14

to ensure for at least once we would move beyond that, and

now we have this chance and this opportunity through

section 2 of the Voting Rights Act to ensure that black

where there is evidence of racially polarized voting, or

2

block voting, so that you could create a district there,

3

then Gingles would suggest that's what you look at to see

4

if there's a section 2 violation.
Now, if you establish that, can the remedy be to

create a district in a different part of the State, not

where the evidence showed at all that would satisfy

Gingles, but go to a completely different part of the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL BENDER

12

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

13

SUPPORTING THE APPELLEES

14
15

MR. BENDER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

16

Let me start with the question that has occupied

17

the Court during much of this argument, and that is the

18

question of whether, if the Gingles factors are satisfied

19

so that there's a compelling interest in satisfying

20

section 2 by drawing minority majority districts, whether

21

the State can then locate those districts anywhere in the

22

State.

23

It is not our position that the State can locate

24

them anywhere in the State, and in this case the State did

25

not locate them anywhere in the State.

1

The District 12 which was ultimately drawn here

2

contains two areas, the Charlotte area here, and the

3

Durham area here, which are -- contain a substantial part

4

of the black population.

5

contains a little over 30 percent of the black population

6

in this district.

7

In this district Charlotte alone

Durham contains some more.

Both of those areas were in a compact district

8

in the Shaw II plan that's in the joint appendix.

9

this plan here.

10

It's

Charlotte was in this district, and Durham was

11

in this district, so there's a substantial overlap between

12

those people.

13

And in addition, another limiting criterion,

14

Justice Kennedy, is that the district must be placed in an

15

area so that the majority of the black population in the

16

district has been a victim of the polarized voting that

17

invoked section 2, and a majority of that population is

18

politically cohesive with other minorities in the State

19

who have been the victims of that, and the findings of

20

fact in this case, which are amply supported by the

21

evidence, are that that was exactly true here.

22

QUESTION:

Is it the case that if, in fact,

23

those criteria are met -- you see, what -- I find it quite

24

difficult, because there's a constitutional principle that

25

you're permitted to do this when there's a compelling

need, and then it has to be narrowly tailored.
And by itself, narrowly tailored might suggest

2

3

compactness, but is there a principle involved that, if it

4

is compact, and you insist on it, then only black-related

5

districts would have the requirement of not taking into

6

account protecting incumbencies, while white districts

7

would not have such a requirement, and can the

8

Constitution permit such a result, if that's right?

9

And what I want you to address, if you can, is

10

if that's right, there's a constitutional principle each

11

way.

12

the basic principle of equal protection of the law would

13

seem to cut in the opposite direction, so how can those be

14

reconciled?

Narrow tailoring cuts in favor of compactness, but

15

MR. BENDER:

Well, I think that's exactly right.

16

If North Carolina had wanted to create a district in which

17

farmers were a majority, there's no constitutional

18

principle which would stop it from creating a noncompact

19

district like that.

QUESTION:

you about the creation of a white district.

No, not a district based on race.

In this case, the district court found that the

State acted not to satisfy a desire of the States, but to

8

satisfy an obligation of the States, an obligation to

9

comply with Federal law, an obligation to comply with

10

section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

obligation, it has less discretion in doing that, in

QUESTION:

Well, the problem -- the problem, of

1

You could have had a much more

concentrated second district if you were only going for

two majority black districts in spite of the fact that no

one has given us any indication of why the failure to have

a second majority black district could possibly have been

7

a section 2 violation.
MR. BENDER:

8

Two points there.

One, they chose

9

to do that because if they had done this district, this

10

would be a district that had almost no coherence except

11

that it was a minority majority district.

7

specifically for two majority black districts, and there

8

is no justification that anyone has asserted under

9

section 2 for punching that into the computer.
MR. BENDER:

10

No, there is.

Section 2 says that

11

if minorities are denied a fair opportunity to participate

12

in the political process because of racial polarization in

13

voting and because the minorities -- and when the

14

minorities are cohesive, then you have to create a

15

majority minority district for them.
Now, it's true that in this case, as you pointed

16
17

out a number of times, the second district that was

18

compact was not a majority minority district, it was a 49-

19

point- something percent minority district, and of that

20

49 percent, I think about 42 percent were black, and about

7 percent were Native Americans.
