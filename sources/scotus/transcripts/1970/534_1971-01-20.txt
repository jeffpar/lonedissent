,

2©

The legal issue in this ease is much like that in

21

the preceding ease f except that the question arises under a

22

different statute.

23

This is a criminal ease.

It comes here on direct

24

appeal from the single judge District Court from the Central

25

District of California* which dismissed the indictment on- the
:
2

1

grounds that the statute under which it was brought is un­

2

constitutional.

3

Section 1461 ©f Title XVIII of the United States Cede which isj
i
set forth on pages 2 and 3 of our brief®

4
5

The statutory provision hereInvolved is

This makes guilty of a crime any person who know­

6

ingly uses the mail for sending any nonmailable matter and

7

that term is defined to include every obscene, lewd,

8

lascivious, indecent, filty or 'vile article matter, thing,

9

device or substance.

1C

The indictment charges a violation of Section 1461

11

on three counts.

Although the appendix contains some other

12

material, particularly the text of an affidavit for a search

13

warrant, 1 believe thattne only matters that are before the

14

Court are these three counts of the indictment, very brief

15

paragraphs, and a motion to dismiss.

16

on the ground that Section 1461 is uncons titutional,both on

17

its face arid as applied.

This motion was filed

18

The Government stipulated that the booklet which

19

was the subject of count throe had been ordered by. a Postal

20

Inspector who was an adult and that it had no evidens® that the

21

other two booklets had not been solicited-by'adults.

22

The Court then Indicated that this stipulation would

23

b® regarded as having been made as an amendment to the indict­

24

ment in response fc© a bill of particulars to which counsel on

25

both sides concurred a*ud we believe that that brings the
3

!

situation within this Court's Fruehauf decision in 365 U.S.

2

The Court then dismissed the indictment* relying

or.

8

Stanley against Georgia* which is interpreted as establishing

4

a right t© receive obscene material.

5

necessary consequence of Stanley that individuals cannot be

6

restricted from distributing obscene materials commercially

7

through the mails to adults who solicit such material.

10

The Court found it a

Despite the express disavowal ia Stanley ©f any

S
9

1

intent t© impair the holding in Roth against the United States*
• it sustained a conviction under the very statute involved

11

here.

The Court dismissed the indictment as applied to tills

12

particular prosecutione and this direct appeal followed under

13

the Criminal Appeals Act as it then stood.
This case involves the power of Congress to pro-

14

15

hibifc use of the mails for commercial distribution of obscene

18

matter.

17

establish post offices and post roads and also to regulate

18

commerce with foreign nations and among the several states.

19

This Court has consistently upheld the power of Congress*

20

acting under -these powers* to enact measures designed in the

21

judgment of Congress to promote the public health* morals and

22

welfare.

Under the constitution Congress is given power t©

J>

23

It is nearly 100 years since this Court upheld the

24

validity ©f the statute which prohibited the sending of lottery

25

tickets through 'the mail and in doing so, the Court likened

that statute to the one then in effect which prohibited the

I think it would not make

policy of the Department of Justice not to prosecute in cases

indeed* the specific statement that Roth and the cases follow-

The protection there was given to Stanley and in
In referring to First Amendment

There was no suggestion that any

10

ing it are not impaired* can have significance only as

11

recognising that the materials themselves are not subject to

12

protection.

13

And* as I mentioned in my argument in the 37

14

photographs case* this was recognised as recently as last

15

Thursday in this Court's decision in the Mailbox case where

16

the Court referred to the line which separates obscenity from

17

constitutionally protected expressions.

18

\

For the purposes of the motion to dismiss in this

case' it has been conceded that the materials involved here

First Amendment protection.
Stanley holds that the state cannot inquire into

23

the contents of & man’s library, for that inevitably involves

24

supervision of the morality ©f his own individual thoughts,

25

but this does not require to cbndbhe the distribution of

14

It would in on© sens®, require overruling Roth,

16

for this reason? obviously In Roth that issue was not presented:

for the proposition that one has the right to receive explicit j

I would assume that the traditional First Amendment principles

apply.

Under what respects can that right to read be limited? .
.

20

How, the only justifications that we can see for

21

limitation '

that right would be if those materials were

22
23

distributed to juveniles. .Another limitation was that they

were ©bstrusively forced upon other persons. But, in all otherj

'
A
Well, generally speaking, in broad terns,

22

there have been so-called limitations of what we calls time,

23

place and manner.

But, the point that we are asking this Court is

15

only to perform a judicial function? fc© declare the. statute

16
17

unconstitutional because it covers consenting adults as well
■
as others. It covers people who really want it. Congress has

indicated that it can act, and it has done that.

its part? it has now provided that if an adult and his minors

I think that the court below properly concluded that

the indictment should be dismissed because d£ the failure to

allege the essential allegations, but again» like Mr,

8

Fleishman, I think that Jbfee Court here might properly say

9

that this Comstock Act is too broad and therefore, it cannot

10

y;_;

stand compatibly with the First Amendment.

-It is true, as the Solicitor General says, the two

14

Judges, from California, Massachusetts, Oregon, Minnesota ~

15

some of the most eminent jurists have read Stanley and have

18

understood in the light ©£ everything that9 s gone’ up to the

17

point that so far as a consenting adult is concerned, he should!

1©

have his freedom, and the man who mails to him should certainly,
