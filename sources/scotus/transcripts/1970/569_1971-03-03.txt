ORAL ARGUMENT BY CHARLES F. COTTAM, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS ROBINSON, ET AL.

6

MR. COTTAM:

7
8

We will hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice and Members of this

Honorable Court:
If it please the Court, I will open and present

9
10

case Number 570 and will be followed by Mr. Williams, who will
present Number 569.

I expect to take approximately

5 minutes

11

in presenting 570.
12

If Your Honors please, this matter, Number 570 is
3
before you on appeal from the three-judge District Court in
4
Rhode Island, declaring one of the public laws of

969 which

5
is commonly referred to as the salary supplement act, uncon­
16

stitutional on the grounds that it violates the First Amendment
7
of the Constitution of the United States by reason of

the

8
entanglement that is inheret

in the act.

9
The case comes before this Court with rather a
20
substantial record.

There is substantial documentary evidence:

21

depositions, and there is oral testimony beloxv.
22
I would like for just a moment to analyse the act,
23
which is very brief.

Section I of the act sets forth the

24
legislative findings and in essence, it sets forth much of the
25
3

\
\

crisis which you have heard testimony about this morning?

1
2

.

involving these other cases that have been before you.

3

Particularizing in Rhode Island the nonpublic schools are

4

facing a crisis at the elementary school level.

5

45,000 or 25 percent of these children are educated in non-

6

public schools.

At this level

The crisis arises by reason of the financial

7
3

difficulties of the schools in their ability to offer a sub­

9

stantial or a competing salary for qualified teachers that are

10

qualified and are teaching in the public schools of the' state.

IS

They point out that in 1960 this crisis was recog­

\

12

nized by the state on behalf of the cities and towns in which

13

the State of Rhode Island participates now rather heavily in

14

the cost of the education of the public school students.
Section II of the act pertains to definitions and

15
16

under the act the nonpublic school is a nonprofit school and

\7

it is one where the per student cost of education does not

m

equal or exceed the cost per student cost of education for a

19

pul)lie school student.
Mow, a nonpublic school teacher is .defined as a

20
21

22
23
24
25

teacher in a nonpublic school and one who teaches only subjects
which are required to be taught in the public schools of the
state.
Mow, those nonpublic school teachers who become
eligible for what we call the "salary supplement," which is

4

1

roughly 15 percent of their salary, must satisfy certain

a

requirements that are set forth in the act.

3

one, the teacher must request the supplement»

That is: number
Number two —

4

Q

That is the individual teacher?

5

A

The individual teacher, Your Honor.

How,

6

the teacher must also teach secular subjects to the same

7

extent as those subjects are taught in the public schools of

8

the state.

3
10
11
12

textbooks and the like, which are used in the public schools
of the state and in addition to this, the teacher must promise
that he will not teach a course in religion so long as he was
receiving a salary supplement.
Now, the regulations that are set forth or the

13
14
15
16
17

power to make regulations that are given in Section V of the
act, make it very clear that the payment is to be made directly
to the teacher and not to the school.

20
21

22
23
24

It's a mandatory re-

quirement to be put in the regulations.

And that teacher must also use materials, that is

17

Q

Would it be an offense of any kind to

A

As I recall it is not a sworn statement.

20

It is a direct misrepresentation and because in the presence

21

of evidence to the contrary you would lose the supplement»

Q

That would be the only sanction?

A

Yes, Your Honor»

remaining, Your Honor,

I think I will not get into an analysis

of the decision of the

Court below, but rather I would like to take a moment again to
call your attention to the evidence that was submitted to the
Court below and the findings.
And X would like to make the observation that we
have no quarrel with the findings as made by the Court below.
The question we have and the disagreement we have, is with the
Court’s analysis of the Schempp, Allen and Walz test and the
present existence and effect of Walz on Shempp-Allen, and this
will be covered, by Mr, Williams,
Going back into the evidence that was submitted by

There

is nothing in the act which requires either the school or the
teacher t© conform to the act*

14
In summation, Your Honors, it's the position of the

15
State that the evidence submitted in the court below indicated

16
very clearly that this act is designed to remove a -crisis in

17
the State of Rhode Island at.the parochial school level»

18
It's also designed to provide the quality education

19
that the State feels is necessary.

The Court found that the

20
evidence supports -the findings; that the purpose of the act is
21

entirely secular»

The evidence introduced below indicates a

22
total absence of permeation within the meaning of the Allen
23
decision»

So that all that remains to be done is to test the

24
continuing existence and the applicability of this Court's

ORAL ARGUMENT BY EDWARD BENNETT WILLIAMS, ESQ.
14

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS EARLY, ET AL,

1

MR. WIIjLIAMS.

a

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court;

3

I would like to take just a few moments, if 1

4

may, and say a word about the statutory scheme that8s under

S

scrutiny here in this decision.

6

When Allen made the judgment some years ago as to

7

the Federal Government that it was difficult to gat quality

8

teachers for the elementary school grades and so it enacted a

9

law granting a subsidy or a bonus to teachers in the elementary

10

public schools

31

of the State of Rhode Island.

It gave that

bonus directly to the teacher.

12

Subsequently, in 1960 it escalated that bonus to

13

30 percent of the supplement, but it immersed it in other

14

kinds of aid that it provided to the cities and towns of the

15

State of Rhode Island.

16

It picked up 30 percent of the costs

of elementary school education at the public school level in

17

Rhode Island.

18

So, when this statute was passed in 1969 what the

19

State Legislature was doing was simply including within the

20

penumbra of the general welfare statute applicable to elemen­

21

tary school teachers in the State of Rhode Island, those
i
teachers who were in nonpublic, nonprofit schools.

22

23

Now, there are 98 parochial schools in the State

24

of Rhode Island.

25

There are about 1,000 parochial school
15

1

1

teachers the record shows.

2

nonparoehial, nonpublic or independent private schools.

3

many of those teachers are eligible and qualified?

A

have been declared eligible and have'qualified under this

5

act?

Only 161.

Why?

There are about 176 teachers in
Hew

How many

Because the act is so tailored as to
/

S

exclude those independent schools whose per pupil expenditure

7

exceeds that of the public schools of the State of Rhode

8

Island because* indeed* they don't need that kind of aid.

9

Now, how many of the parochial school teachers are

10

qualified for this kind of aid?

u

record shows.

iz

nuns don't qualify under this because the statute requires

33

that the teacher receive the minimum standards applicable to

U

the public school system before a teacher can qualify for the

15

aid:and the statutes of $hode Island show us that $4,000 is the

16

Why?

Two-hundred and forty-two, the

Because the balance of them are nuns and

.minimum salary paid to the public school teacher in the State

17

of Rhode Island and the record shows us that 'the nuns who

18

teach in the parochial schools of the State of Rhode Island

19

receive $1,800 a year if they have a Bachelor's Degree and

20

$1/900 a year if they have a Master's Degree.

21

So, we come down to 161 teachers receiving a

22

supplement of 15 percent of the salary that's given to them.

23

What effect did.-tills have?.

24

-the State of Rhode Island were able to offer, the record shows,

25

$5,000 as a starting salary to their teachers, while the

In 1968 the parochial schools of

16

t

public schools were offering $6,000.

2

supplement herein provided for, the parochial schools could

3

offer $6,000 by raising its contribution from five to fifty-

4

one hundred and the State V70uld then contribute $900 directly

5

to the teacher under some very sharply defined and circum­

s

scribed conditions.
Number one; that the teacher did not teach

7
8
9
10

11
12
13
14
15
16

religion; number twos that the teacher was certified by the
State of Rhode Island; number three; that the teachers used
only those materials and textbooks used in the public schools
for subjects being taught and required to be taught in the
public schools of Rhode Island.

19
20
21

22

Rhode Island and number six: that the salary plus the supple­
ment, not equal or exceed — not exceed the maximum average for
■the public school counterpart teacher.
That3s what this act did.

25

In other words, it

provided to certain teachers under carefully circumscribed
conditions, a possible parity of income for teaching the same
subjects with the same materials, with the same certification
in nonpublic schools, substandard public schools, because their
per pupil expenditure was below the public school expenditure.
Now, if the Court please; what did the lower court

23
24

Number five; that the teacher

received a minimum salary provided for in the public schools of

17
18

By virtue of the salary

say with

respect to this act?

Because, I submit to the Court

that the statutory scheme here in the State of Rhode Island,
17

i

is no different from a situation where the State would offer

2

$50© grant or an $800 grant to all elementary school teachers

3

across the hoard to nonprofit schools, so long as they did not

4

teach religion*
I don't think that kind of statute would be sub­

5
6

ject successfully to constitutional attack under the test that

7

has been laid down here*

8

here»

9

That's precisely what we have done

What did the lower court say?

It purported to apply

the purpose and primary effect test and what did it say about

1©

the purpose?

11

examining the statute's purpose, presents little difficulty*

12

The Salary Supplement Act, in our opinion, is not intended to

13

advance in the field of religion*

14

15
te
17

18
19
2©

The statute recites its

The

legislative concern,ve find nothing in the history and struc­
ture of law to suggest that

the legislative purpose was other

It then goes on to say that it certainly fulfills
a secular purpose while -the statutes

the purpose <?f the legislature was.

It says

It finds that it did have

that effect, but it goes on to say: "But, on the other hand,
we think it equally clear that the act gives significant aid
to a religious enterprise."
Afc page 40 it repeats and it says: "The second part
of the Schexnpp test determining the statute’s primary effect,
presents a little more difficult problem of definition and
application."

Plaintiffs have argued that primary means

essential or fundamental.

Defendants say that leaders have

taken a more literal position, claiming that primary means
first in order of importance.

The problem of definition is

critical in this case because, as we have noted, -the act has
two significant effects: on the one hand it aids the quality
of secular education; on the other it provides support to a
religious enterprise.
This Court, since it began the revolution of the
purpose and primary test, has found in four instances -that the
19

1

mere fact that an effect of a statute may be of aid or

z

benefit to religion, does not constitute a barrier

passing constitutional muster.

then we must, of necessity, reverse Everson; we must reverse

24
25

It would be as follows;

we would roll back the

McGowan? we must reverse Allen and we must reverse Walz.
And if we consider the nature of the word "signi-

22
23

of following the lower court5 s concept of the primary

fieant",

’’significant aid" to a secular enterprise, then we

had better focus on how significant the aid is here.

The aid

here; 161 teachers from 98 schools, or oae-aM-a-half teachers

a

insignificance compared to the significance ©f the aid in

Everson in 1947 when a whole school-load of children were

4

bused to and from schools.

Simple arithmetic will tell you that if you paid

6

ten cents a ride to take 300 little boys and girls to and from

7

school, on 180 school days a year, twice a day, y©u are talk­

3

ing about $12,000 or $13,000.

9

In Board of Education against Allen we talked

10

about giving textbooks, of lending textbooks to the children

n

of the New York elementary schools,

24
25

If -they received their

school expenditure that dwarfs the expenditure that is coun­
tenanced in this particular stipend.
So, I suggest that when the Court writes down,
writes down the Rhode Island statute as daring to pass the
primary test facet of the test fashioned by this Court, that
because it is giving significant aid to these schools it is
running counter to the whole train of decisions of this Court.
Now, if the Court please —

Q

In all these cases that you referred to, or

21

at least in all the recent ones, is it not correct that the

22

Court has expressed the view that this is a matter of degree,

23

the entanglement or the involvement or the potential for it?

24
25

A

I think that this is expressed and arti­

culated clearly, perhaps for the first time in Waiz against
23

i

the Tax Commission.

2

this is the caveat of Walz, as I read it; it does not abrogate

3

the purpose and primary effect test at all? it simply adds

4

caveat to the primary effect test, the purpose and primary

5

effect test, and it says "if the program, if the statute,

6

creates an. excessive entanglement between church and religion

7

then the statute must fail."
And then the Court made a calculated choice be­

M

And the question then becomes, because

tween the exemption of the ad valorem tax to churches and the
imposition of the ad valorem tax for churches and found that
there was a lesser degree of involvement resulting from the
exemption than from the imposition.

Looking down the road,

and apparently shunning the prospect of foreclosing on a
church.

I suggest, if the Court please, that the same
rationale holds here, because this Court, in discussing this
problem, had this to say:

"If the quality of teachingn — ■ this

falls too low, then not only

18
19
20
21

22
23
24

will Catholic parents be reluctant to enroll their children,
but that the parochial schools will run afoul of Rhode

Island * s education laws."
Fifty years ago this Court said that parents could
satisfy the compulsory school attendance laws of this nation
by sending their children to these schools.

The unspoken

'Corollary of that, of course-,''was that the State has a right

25
24

!

to regulate the secular facet of these schools, and indeed,

a

they have.

3

4
5

children must go; they pick the holidays; they required cer­
ti >cation of the teachers and they indeed, have insisted that
certain subjects be taught.

8
Q
m

11

Rhode Island has done the same.

Now, I say, if the Court please, that if the State

6

7

They have regulated the number of days to which

can compel then it may assist, and that's what it’s doing
here.

I say that the degree of involvement between ’the

operation of these schools and the compulsory school atten­
dance laws of Rhode Island and the rest of the country, in
fact, make the degree of involvement of paying $900 to the
teacher d@ minimis.
I say also that if the legislative judgment has
been made by the State of Rhode Island that these schools
cannot attract and hold qualified teachers for secular sub­
jects, without those teachers being given a subsidy, then the
quality of secular education in those schools is going to
fall and when it becomes marginal ~ when it becomes marginal

18
the only confrontation which this Court eschewed in Walz
29

20
21

22

against the Tax Commission becomes a reality.

Because then

there comes the kind of entanglement, the kind of excessive
entanglement that -this Court expressed its abhorrence for last
year in Walz against the Tax Commission.

23
Q

Does this record show the extent of the

24
surveillance of prisate schools in Rhode Island to determine
25

whether the hours and the curriculum and the teachers meet

A

How is that done?

The statutes of Rhode Island cover this,

Mr. Chief Justice.»

.There is a statute called "Compulsory

5

Attendance?" it is in Title XVI, Chapter 19 of the Rhode .

parochial schools keep up abreast of those standards'?

I suspect, Mr. Justice, that there is .no

surveillancer on that subject? I suspect there is none, but

14

the record is silent on it.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY MILTON STANSLER, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES

7
3

MR. STANZLERj

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court?

9

My role here is to relate the record to the laws

10

set forth by Mr. Pf effer and to suggest to the Court that 'the

n

record in the case amply supports the findings of fact made

12

by the trial court below.

13
14

j

First, I would like to explain how the legislation
hasippicassntad.

The deputy commissioner of education testifies!

.

IS

and related that he was appointed by the commissioner of

IS

education by the laws, rules and regulations, and subsequently

17

after drawing up die rules and regulations they were considered

18

at a public hearing and they were adopted and the materials,

19

the rules and regulations, together with the application forms

20

for teachers, together with the NPS Number 31 that Mr. Williams

21

referred to, were sent to the nonpublic schools.

22

Thereafter, the nonpublic schools submitted the

23

accounting forms or the expenditure sheets and the data con­

24

tained therein, together with the application to the deputy

25

commissioner of education.

And he then reviewed the forms
47
v

I

of some 250 teachers and approved all of thesis? all of them

2

coming from the Roman Catholic schools.

3

I think in answer to some of the questions that

4

might be pertinent, for just a moment to take a look at the

5

role that the commissioner of education must play here.

6

must,,:, as set .forth in page 3 of the rules and regulations,

7

verify? “The Department of Education upon receipt of a salary

8

supplement# shall determine the applicant's eligibility by

9

verifying whether ©r not the applicant complies with the

10

He

regulations."
The expenditure form which is attached to it sets

11
12

forth a summary of all the current expenditures of the school.

13

It is not just the expenditures for secular education' that are

4

IS

set forth.
Q

I talc© it you are making that point on the

16

entanglement aspect.

17

Is there any difference in

Your Honor# they would have to submit the

form ©f expenditures# the same form# and provided a teacher
applies# as the commissioner ©£ education testified# if the
expenditures exceed the par pupil expenditure for the grade
in the public schools# then he would go into the school and

48

‘I

conduct an audit? and as he testified? would make a de€texrais&“

2

tion as between the sectarian' expenditures and the secular

3

expenditures.

4

If a new school wanted'' to"apply for the act and have its

5

teachers apply it would have to do the same thing.

6

And this same thing would apply to new schools.

Q

I suppose we could judicially take notice

7

the reality that soma state boards of education have dis­

8

qualified some private schools because of their failure to

9

maintain minimum standards? even though they had no religious

10

connection at all.

I think that there is a

19

difference, however, with respect to, as ray brother pointed

out ~ my brother Pfeffer pointed out — with respect to

21

reporting the number of students attending 'the schools.

22

is a different as to determining, making a determination as

23

to the sectarian expenditures and the secular expenditures as

24

required under this act and as the Commissioner of Education

25

says h@5s going to perform.

Wouldn’t the school authorities say:

cases, for instance of Pierce against the Society of Sisters,

11

that the private schools can teach certain subjects.

weakly time allotment that comes out each year in September.

The religious classes will deal with the study of the various

13

•tenets of the Roman Catholic education.

14

Since the passage of the act f teachers who have

15

applied for the supplement do not teach religious courses„ but

16

prior the lay teachers could if they wanted fco and if they

17

felt competent.

13

determine if she wants fco begin her class with a prayer.

It

would be up to the individual teacher to

One reason for the salary supplement act? or I

20

might point out that there are sometimes visiting missionaries

21

at least one® a year and of course the handbook provides that

22

the vocations programs are conducted one® a year.

23

There was testimony given by the ©ns nun who did

24

apply and did qualify under the act and she was asked what her

25

view was ©£ the role ©£ a teacher ©f a parochial school? and
54

f

she said; on page 23 of the Joint Appendix?

religious thinking of the Catholic today it is that as young

3

adults going into the community they should hold a Catholic

S

“According to

attitude toward different things they meet with and yet it £a

not totally Catholici it is a Christian attitude*
"As teachers, we by our example, particularly and

our handling of the children, try to inculcate in them the

same Christian attitudes*

cipline, and we try to exert discipline with the children so

As we religiously are'told to dis­

10

•that they would fe© open to study and have the proper attitude

toward their work»"

12

■The religious atmosphere that permeates at the

13

school is that, of -the teachers themselves, though she does

14

not think that this is an overall religious atmosphere.

15

One of the principal functions of the parochial

16

schools, she said, is to have available formal religious train­

\7

ing, because otherwise the children would not be reached ex­

18

cept in the cateshismal classes after school and'you do not

get that at an early age.

into the contracts with the teachers under the salary — it

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY EDWARD BENNETT WILLIAMS* ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

24
25

MR. WILLI MIS s

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
I would like to take these few minutes to just
56

I

correct two impressions that have been left with the Court in

2

the argument of counsel.

3

Mr, Pfeffer suggested to the Court that the

4

superintendent of schools for the parochial schools ©f Rhoda

5

Island testified that if the statute were held unconstitu­

6

tional then the money would just continue to come from the

7

parish <>

8
9

Th® record shows» first of all» that what the
superintendent testified to was that the contracts with hie

10

teachers were signed after the statute was passed and that

11

because the individual schools were bound by those contracts

12

they would have to pay for that year the amount of money

13

called for in the contract because it had been executed.

U

it did not suggest — he did not suggest? he did not say that

15

thereinafter that the schools would be able t© continue this

W

higher stipend.

17

But»

Now» an issue has been injected in the last

18

moments ©f the argument here.

*9

that there is some kind of exclusion policy in these schools»

20

either racially or religiously and 1 receive a comeuppance

2?

this morning from Mr. Pfeffer when he said that I had mis­

22

stated Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

23

The suggestion has bean mades

Well» Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act

24

specifically incorporated in the Rhode Island Salary Supple­

25

ment statute» precisely stated: "Such regulations shall ensure
51

1

that any nonpublic school* as that term is defined earlier in

2

this chapter.- which employs teachers who receive salary sup­

3

plements as provided for in this chapter? shall comply with

4

file provisions contained in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act

5

of 196
And the suggestion was made this morning -that

6
7

•share was an exemption for religion.

Weil? there is an exemp­

8

tion for religion.

9

exemption for religion in Title 42# 2000 Section. 1 in hiring

There is a very narrow circumscribed

19

policies ©£ institutions where the hiring is by a religious

11

institution for a religious activity.

12

religious school does not have to hire somebody of a different

13

religion to teach religion# which would have no application

14

to this case# because religion teachers are excluded from the

15

benefits of the act# in any event.

It is so that a

There was no suggestion at any time until the

16

17

waning hours of fch® argument her® in this Court that there was

18

ever any exclusion on the basis of race from any of these

19

schools? never# or any time in the lower court# and indeed the

20

record is diametrically t© the contrary and I invite ’the Court

21

t© read it.

22
23

And I suggest# likewise# there has been no
evidence produced in this record in fell© lower court where any­

24

one is excluded from these schools by virtu© of religion for#

25

indeed# the record once again is diametrically opposite to the

58

suggestion that was mad® in the closing moments of counsel’s

argument»

nothing could be farther from the facts?

If you read the record hare from pages 120 to 12?

10

you will see the long colloquy that went on between counsel

11

with respect to the provisions ©f this handbook in evidence,

VI

tod it was pointed out that many sections of the handbook

13

were superceded and never operative and were never put into

14

practice and counsel met and stipulated with respect to cer­

15

tain portions of the handbook and that whole dialogue is con­

16

tained between 120 and 127 and I suggest to the Court that

17

there leaver was an issue in this case ~ there never was an

38

issue t© which this particular section could be germane be­

39

cause there wafc no proof of exclusion on racial or religious

20

grounds.
For these reasons we ask that this Court uphold
