Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Courts
This is case in this Court's original jurisdic­

12

tion which was brought by the State of Utah under the authority

13

granted by the Congress to determine whether the United States

14

©r Utah, prior to a quit claim deed given by the limited States

15

had title to the lands lying below the meander line of the

25

Great Salt Lake, which is a shallow and very salty body ©f
water ©f some size, lying wholly within the State of Utah in
its northern portion.
After a variety of procedural rulings which X
need net remind the Court of, the case was referred to a
Special Master, the Honorable J. Cullen Ganey to report to
this Court on the issue ©f title.
aspects, and in the proceedings

That issue has several
immediately at hand he bm

decided only on© ©f those, which is whether the Great Salt Lake

was a navigable body of water on the day when Utah became a
2

1

State, January 24, 1896«

2

if the Great Salt Lake was not navigable ©a that date then the

3

United States continued its ownership of all the lands below

4

the meander line and in that situation further proceedings

5

will eventually be required to determine the fair market value

6

©£ tfe® land which have subsequently been quit claimed t© Utah

1

so that Utah may pay that value for the quit claim deeds.

8
9

Mid the parties are fully agreed that

If, on the other hand, the Great Salt bake was
navigable on that day in January, 1896 then the lake bed passes

10

to Utah at that time, instanta, as part ©f the operationof the

11

principle of equal footing, or equality among the states and

12

there is si© necessity for Utah to pay for lands which were

within the boundaries ©f the lake as

they existed on that

day, save possibly for such lands as have been since relisted
by the recession ©f the lake from its shores.
And the issues were: the boundaries ©£ the lake
were ©n January 4, 1896 and whether the United States continued
in title ©r obtained title to such lands as must have reliefced
after that date again is an issue which is not before the
Court at this time and which would have to be decided in a
sufes@qu®at proceeding if the Court should rule for Utah in the
present proceedings.
And I might just very brief remark in that
connection that ".while the Report of the Special Master is in
some minor respect, possibly seams to rule on the reliction
3

I

issue on the ©ae hand in conclusion of Law 18, or in the

2

proposed decree to state that if the lake was navigable Utah

3

obtained title t© all lands within the meander line»

4

it is clear and that Counsel for Utah will agree, that, the

5

issues are as 1 have stated»

X think

6

The question ©£ reliction remains ©pen for future

7

decision and that if the lake was navigable on January 4th the

8

lands which Utah took at that time were the lands which were

9

under the lake waters at that time and not tha lands that might

10

have happened to be within the meander line which had been

II

drawn at some earlier time»

12

Q

Does this mean, Hr». Strauss, if Utah

13

should prevail here that the proposed decree of the Special

14

Master would not be proper?

IS

A

Well, I think that it8s a question of

16

construction, indeed, whether the decree is inconsistent it9s

17

susceptible to a reading'that it's inconsistent" with what I hav

18

stated»

19

past of inviting proposals for decree after original cases»

20

And we hav® been assuming that it would 4© so in this case and

21

we can confront the question at that time»

This Court has always followed the practice in the

22

How, if 1 may turn to the issue which- is her®, as

23

1 hav© said: the only issue is whether the Great Salt Lake was

24

navigable on the date when Utah became a state»

25

hearings in Salt Lake-City'before the Master, both oral

4

There were

■

■1

testimony and numerous documents were produced and on that

2

basis til© Special Master has prepared a lengthy report in

S

which h® concludes that the lake is navigable,

4

dispute that final conclusion I should make

5

think our brief does, that on the whole we acknowledge that the -

6

report is correct in its statement of the facts.

7

speaking of the case w© think the Master has don© an esse© 1 lent

8

job and don’t mean by arguing legal points fe@r® to suggest

9

otherwisee

10

iind, while we

it clear, as I

Strictly

W® accept all the strictly factual findings made

1!

in the report and have mad® exceptions only to findings of law

12

and to two of the findings of fast which in our view embody

IS

essentially missed questions of law and of fact.
Ws contend that the lake was not navigable for

14
15

two reasonss

the first is that the lake presents such ob­

18

stacles to navigation in its natural state that it couldnever

17

b© ussd as a channel ©£ useful commerce and trade by water,

18

without improvements of an unusual extent being raade.
And the second is that ev©n if the lake were

19

2©

navigable in facts,

it lacks any connection in interstate

21

©r foreign ©©msaers© or trad®* and for that reason should be

22

found not navigable in law.
Talcing up the question of navigability in fact,

23
24

again, the parties are largely in agreement of what the under­

25

lying law is.

The proper test was first stated by this Court

5

%

in the Daniel Ball in 10 Wall.

had the Court said there that

2

waters are navigable in fast when they are used ©r are sus-

3

ceptible ©£ being used in their ordinary condition as highways

4

for commerce over which tirade and travel are or may fee con-

S

dusted in the customary mode of trad® and travel on the water.

6

And 1 think the Court will find that the

7

principal dispute here is what that word “susceptible89 means*

0

perhaps some argument about the extent to which improvements

9

may occur without departing from ordinary conditions of water,, .

M

And what the Court meant when it said that they must be useful

n

as highways for commerce.

12

The Master did not find that the Great Salt Lake

13

was actually in use as a highway for somaerc© ©n January 49

14

1896.

15

us©? not counting excursion trips which had been mad@r he

16

found th@ boating uses of the lake had been, more ©£ a private

17

natur® rather than by individual contractors for hire.

18

Finding ©f Fact 51.

19

He found only that it was capable or susceptible ©f suck

Xt*s

In Finding ©f Fact 52 he found no evidence to show

20

that there was ever any regularly scheduled freight or passen­

21

ger service operated on the lake*

22

So the question is whether it is reasonable to

23

believe that this laic® in its ordinary and natural condition

24

could become a highway ©£ commerce.

25

folds & discussion of that question.

He found that on 'that date that the lake

and about 33 miles wide.

6

7

some confusion — I think there is a typographical error at

8

one point, but 1 think it clearly found'that its elevation of

10

It exposed approximately 1500 square

depth a depth of 30 feet, and average depth of 13 feet.

n

We .have submitted to the Clerk and Counsel and

12

asked him t© distribut to you a small map of the lake to which

14

Q

But wkafe X was getting at is: what is

IS

meant by body of water in “its natural state or condition, * as

16

applied to this lake?

17

A

Oh, well basically, and perhaps the

18

simplest way to answer it would be to refer to this Court8s

19

decision in the Montelle, which involved the Fox River.

20

Fox River was a body of water which, as it existed in ©nature

21

wouldtransport boats of two-and- a-ha 1 £ foot -depth down it for

22

a considerable distance, although there were some rapids and

23

riffles to be gone through.

24

the case got, to this Court, questioning whether it was a navigabl.

2§

waterway or not.

The

It had been improved by the time

And, in deciding whether it was a navigable

1

t

waterway the Court said; "W® will not concern ourselves with

2

those improvements with those canals9 ditches, locks, and so

3

forth; but rather with the river as it was when man found its

4

unimproved, unexcavated, undredged, "and the issue was whether,

S

in those circumstances it could carry trade and commerce, and

6

the Court found that these boats ©f two-and-a-ha1f foot depth

1

carrying substantial loads of lumber and other goods in fact,

8

frequently ran the river, engaging in commerce of a very sub­

0

stantial sort»

1©

Q

h lot of — there are a few methods? I

II

gather,“of traveling even in very shallow waters»

12

down in the Everglades with these air-propelled boats

13

A

1 remember

That's right, Mr. Justice Douglas»

14

Thankfully, again 1896 perhaps is helpful to us in that respect.

IS

It is quit© clear from the cases that "the question of navigatio i

m

is with the means of navigation which were available at the

n

time, and I don't believe that an air boat would have been

18

available in 1896»

19

Q

That's pretty well settled? is it?

20

A

I believe it is.

I think another appro­

21

priate response to that? ©£ course one has today amphibious

22

trucks of enormous dimension sand power craft and thelike»

23
24

In

virtually no case whiten this Court has decided would not involve
a body of water which couldn't be navigated by one or another

R

Quite plainly one of these air boats could have navigated those

waters„

Q

Of course here the Master vary clearly

found that as ©£ fell® date of statehood, January 1896, the lake

6

was physically capable ©£ being used in its ordinary condition

The white

There is a — since the time

Bo that 1 think one can say that the waters to

7

which the Master was referring in the passage which you have

8

read are the waters within the blue line and it can been seen

9

that indeed those waters do run virtually from the aorfchemtip

1©

©£ the lake to virtually the southern tip of the lake.
I think it can also be seen# however# that along

11

12

the ©astern and western shores ©£ the lake# as the Master also

13

specifically found# in particular behind Stansb^ry Island and

14

Carrington Island in the lower left and in the whole ©£ the

15

Bear River Bay and feha Farmington Bay are on the right. But

16

there is a very wide expanse of land which has bean exposed .

25

of only a two-foot difference in depth over the course of a

I .think theCourt will see that there are considerable

1©

mil© ©f horizontal difference.

2

And this is basically where the United States

3

arguments in the case rest.

4

carefully selected point on the lake to another carefully

5

selected point on the lake, but this is a lake and sot a river.

6

With rivers one is only concerned withtraveling the length ©f

7

the river.

8

so far as navigability is an issue and has naver been at issue

9

in this Court's cases.

It’s true one can go from one

Crossing the river is never a vary great concern

But we don’t think a lake is very

10

useful for commerce when you can't get out of the lake to any­

li

place else and when you can only visit only one or two places

12

upon its shores.

Bo that I am very clear, assume that

14

an island in the lake that had a very valuable mineral deposit

15

on it and the only way to get to the island, was by boat and the

16

only way to get the minerals out was by boat and the lake was

17

perfectly equipped to sustain that kind of transportation.

18

A

Right.

19

Q

The minerals came from the island onto the

20

barge straight to an interstate railroad ear on the teach.

21

Is that navigability?

22

A

I think not.

23

Q

Well, why not?

24

A

Well, I would have to take it down to,

25

I suppose, what may be a somewhat more prosaic description.

14

«

One may also imagine an island which is being used for farming

purposesQ as there are on this lake, which is surrounded by a

3

body ©f water which is not navigable, let us say, if you are

4

thinking about boats passing from the top of tile river on down

to some port in the bottom part and yet the family that farms

Well, isn't that — that certainly is a

commercial use of the water and it9s being used for transpor­

15

A

It is being used for transportation of

18

goods being taken to market but I d© feel that the Court9s

17

cases have been concerned with commercial use in a broader

18

sense — it might so well as be a marsh, be a swamp, be one of

19

■these areas which is passable only by air boat.

No? not it's a very fine distinction but

12

it really comes t© the point that the individual has a choice

about whet means ©f transportation ha is going to employ and

ON BEHALF OF PLAINTIFF

MR. JENSENs

20
21

24
25

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Courts
I would first like to state that Utah does agree

22
23

Very well.

that the issue ©£ relection is not before the Court at this
time; that

the question is ©n@ of navigability.
Utah further agrees that in order for the Great

20

t

Salt Lake to be found navigable on January 4, 1896, it must

z

have been navigable in its natural and ordinary condition.

3

We submit that the Master so found.

4

United States in the interpretation of this language of sus­

5

ceptibility .

We disagree with the

We be liare it to be clear front the Court's language

6
7

in United States against Holt State Bank, United States versus

8

Utah, that actual use at statehood is not required? it. is a

9

capacity for use.

We believe we have showed a great deal more

1

than a naked physical capacity, but we believe that that is

1!

all that was necessaryj that iss does the body of water have

12

sufficient length, width, depth.

25

the time of trial was

It had absolutely no future.

Consequently,

any discussion as t© what the future may hold as far as a
build-up of a commerce, with boats going everywhere on the lake
at various points is simply irrelevant.

In fact, in the Holt State Bank case the evidence

It hasn’t been floating waiting for experience to

Secondly, we believe that of course the actual

uses demonstrate this susceptibility very well.

5

kinds ©£ boats had bean used on the lake, both before and

after statehood.

7

it's also true some were used in business.

He found a great many different

It's true some were used for pleasure but

And again, in United States versus Utah, this
Court said that no matter what the use it is still relevant to

n

ease made the very argument it's making here, that while too

The United States in the earlier

»•

12

many ©f these uses are privat® in nature as opposed to being

13

paid for.

14

This Court rejected that argument.
Turning to the argument that there is no access

15

to the lake? that it is to© difficult to get to so that the

16

otherwise usable capacity is made useless, I would first refer

17

to the map which. Counsel submitted to the Court and point out

18

that the Special Master found that Antelope Island had been

19

continuously inhabited since 1848 and the witness which was

20

spoken of earlier, Eillah Walker Manning, testified that she

21

was born on that island in the early 1890s and lived there and

22

that her testimony was that boats were used to transport live-­

23

stock, household supplies, grain, farm equipment.

24

across -the very area which -the United Sates says it's too

25

shallow to navigate and that.vyoa can't get your boat to the

The same is true of Fremont Island» It has

3

sustained a viable livestock industry.

Further, as has already

4

been noted, there are a number of places on the lake where the

5

bed is steep»

6

shore there? that there ar© some bogs, but again we don * t

1

believe unlimited capacity is a requirement that you have to be

8

able to get in at every spot»

We don5t deny that there are some pretty flat

9

Again, in United States versus Utah this Court

10

observed that these 65 miles cf the Colorado River which it

ii

found to be navigable flowed through Rock Canyon for a large
N

m

extent that had walls from 600 to 1200 feet in height»

14

even though sand bars prevented the unrestricted use ©f the

15

lake»

And here the Special Master found that the shallow
waters which ©re around the shore could easily he avoided by
keeping into the navigable channels which he had found extended

19

substantially throughout the length and breadth ©£ the lake»

harbor access
The Master found that there are very few natural

2
3

harbors in the world and the one witness, in fact the only

4

witness who was an expert in navigation, Mr, Thomas Lundy,

5

testified that he was familiar with many of the navigable

waters of the United States as well as other parts of the world

7

and

8

associated on the Great Salt Lake for a period of two years,

9

where fee was involved in the design, construction and opera­

there was only one natural harbor»

Mr, Lundy was

10

tion ©£ a fleet of 39 boats and barges that were used to place

11

causeway fill across the lake»

12

it was necessary to construct a harbor on the west side ©f the

13

Promontory Mountains»

And as a part of that project

14

He testified that rather than being an impediment

15

that the lake was unusually susceptible in this regard because

16

it was easy? it was inexpensive to construct a harbor because

17

of the slay sediment which made up the bed? the lack of bedrock

18

that — I think it mentions that the harbor was 400 by 1500

19

feet»

20

He further testified that they had absolutely no

21

maintenance problems»

22

the lake has no currents s© you don't get the sediments moving

23

back in like you do on most rivsr systems and like you do in

24

the harbors in Saa Francisco Bay»

25

The reason for this, he said, is that

Again on access? the Special Master found that
24

a number of piers and i.osMlif facilities existed at various

2

point on the southern shore and on the eastern shore of the

3

lake.

Q

Any at the time ©£ statehood?

Prior to the time of statehood,

Now, Saltair was built in 1893.

Q

A

13

fes, sir,

Saltair is the ©id pavilion

14

where they had the dance hall out over the lake and where the

15

lake probably got primarily known for its ability for people to

16

get in and float around and I think its fame for that came from

Saltair, which was built at that time.

ON BEHALF OF DEFENDANT
MR. STRAUSSz

I would like to state very briefly 1

that while itss ©vident that -tills is, at the best, a close

is distinguishable.

It5s a matter ©£ proportion, from the

is only 8© miles in its maximum dimension and to us® it in
