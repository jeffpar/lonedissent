6

ARGJMENT OF NORMAN DORSEN, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8
9

MR. NORMAN DORSEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court.
This case, arising in Texas, is a sequel to the de-

10

t1

cisions last term in this Court in Williams v. Illinios, and

12

Morris v. Schoonfield. It involves tJ-,e imprisonment of an indi-

13

gent fo1: inability to pay certain fines imposed for traf.fic

14

offenses:.
Tie facts are not in dispute. Petitioner, Mr. Tate,

15

16

committed several traffic offenses in 1966. These offenses in-

17

eluded driving without an operators license, driving a car with

10

expired license plates and going through a red light. Neither

19

alone, nor taken together, \lere these offenses punishable by

20

a jail sentence.
They were punishable---

21

Q

23

How many times was he arrested for driving a car

without an operators license?

24
25

l

]\

There were nine offenses.

Q

Operators license

4

1

A

I think there were three of those.

2

Q

Any indication why he didn't go down and get a

4

A

No, there's nothing in the record

5

Q

How much do they cost in Texas?

G

A

I don't know that state. Probably ten dollars of

3

7

license?
on that,

so, Two dollars, I'm sorry,

8

Q

Two dollars.

9

A

Neither alone, as I said, or taken together,

10

were these offenses punishabl e by a jail sentence. Petitioner

ti

was tried on two of the traffic offenses andl966 in the Houston

12

Corporation Court. A court whose juri~diction is limited by

13

statute, to offenses punishable by fine alone.

14

He ~,as convioted on the two offe,1ses and fined $75.

15

But the judgement was not executed. This was explained by Pe-

16

titioner at the subsequent h.,beas corpus hearing on the ground

17

that he had paid a lawyer to appeal the oonvictions.

18

In fact the iawyer failed to perfect the appeal. If

19

the appeal had been perfected, the Petitioner would have been

20

entitled to a trial de novo, in the County court, and relieved,

21

at. leaiit templDrarily, from the obligation to pay the fines.
Instead, as I have

22
23
24

said, the convictions became

final, but there's nothing in tve record to indicate that the
Petitioner ever knew that thi~ had occured.
Petitioners' attorney, incidentally, has since been

25
2

5

f

disbarred for other reasons.
Petitioner was not tried on the remaining traffic tick•

&

3

ets until August 7, 1968. He appeared then at the same Cor-

4

poration Court. The Court with jurisdiction only t.o punish by

5

fines. And he pleaded guilty to the other charges.
The judge imposed fines, which, when added to those

6

7

outstanding f.rom 1966 totaled $425. Petitioner, being indigent,

8

was unable to pay the fine. Pursuant to Texas statutes, and the

9

Hou£.ton Code, he was dispatched forth,dth to the Houston Prison

10

Farm to serve 85 days in jail, or one day for each $5 of the

11

fine at the statutory rate in Texas,

12

Relevant statutes are found on page 3 of our brief.

13

Now this was on August 7, 1968, on August 28, 1968,

14

Petitioner commenced a ~abeas corpus action and was released

15

the same day on a bond posted by a friend.

16

He had served 21 days and the unpaid fine was now

17

$321 which would subject him to 64 additional days in jail.
Q

18

19

That same friend didn't help him out with the

fines?
No, he did not, Nr. Justice Black.

20
21

The hear inc• on the habeas corpus petition was held

22

ir, the county Criminal Court on August 30, excerpts from the

23

record of which appear mn the back of Petitioner.s brief, not

24

in the Lrown appendix.

25

The Certiorari Petition contains the entire record
3

6

1

of

the habeas corpus hearing.

2

The County Crim5.nal Court denied the habeas corpus

3

petition and the Texas Court ofCriminal Appeals affirmed and

4

the case then cama here on Certiorari.
There's one further important factor or point I'd like

5

6

to make at the outset. Although the State, in its brief seems

7

to dispute the fact that Petittmner was indigent as of August,

8

1968, when he was sent to jail for nonpayment of a fine, it is,

9

in fact, perfectly clear f.rom the record that the State had

10

stipulated, during the hearing and the habeas corpus petition,

J1

that Petition~r was "poverty stricken, and that his whole famiiy

12

has been for all periods therein, and probably always will be."

13

This ls in the Appendix brief, page 7A.

14

Q

Oid he own a car?

15

A

That does not appear in the record. The reason

16

that that was not explored, Mr. Justice Marshall, is that the

17

guarnishment provisions in the law of Texas exempt levying on

10

the car of a married man, so that car couldn't have been used

19

to pay---

20
21

22

Q

Well, he could have sold it-

A

Well, he might have done that.

Q

Well, what happens if a man has 64 charges of

23

driving without a license, reckless driving, and doing bodily

24

harm with an automobile? l\nd he's broke?
A

25

Well, the first thing that has to happen is that

4
7

1

if he has no money, the court, the lower court, the criminal

2

court as this Court has said in the Williams case last year,

3

there are several alternatives.
One is, if he has the possibility of earning some

4

5

money, to stretch out the fine over a period of time.

6

If that won't work, another alternative is to find

7

a job for him, or put him to work on a prison farm, or some-

0

thing of the so~t, but not to confine him, 24 hours a day.

9

Q

Working on a prison farm isn't confining him?

10

A

Well, what I had in mind there is the ABA,

11

in its minimum standards of sentencing, provides, they call that

12

partial confinement. The study by the ABA concluded that in

13

the case of the fine---

14

Q

Well, I'm sure Texas doesn't have one.

15

A

No, they do not. They do not.

16

Q

Would that be constitutionally any less offensive

17

if he wer~ tJnly confined 12 hours a day insteaa of 24?
A

18

Well, if he

1-1ere

confined only for the purpose

19

of having h.Lm worl< out on a job the fine, we suggest it would

20

not be constitutionally offensive.
in other words, if the man cannot pay, if it's clear

21

22
23

24

25

as Mr. Ju..;tice Marshalls hypothetical put i:t, he wasn't able
to pay, our fii:st ccnsti.t.utional requirement following the
Williams opinion is thut perhaps he might pay if the fine is
stretchAd out over
5

o~riod of time.

r

1

Q

Wouldn't that be something at least resembling

2

involunta,:-y servitude if the sentence of the court was that

3

he spend 12 hours a day at the local prison farm, at least 8

4

hours of which would be spent working at $2 an hour?

5

A

I don• t think i-i; would be because, of course,

G

there is a spec~fic exception in the ThirteentL Amendment for

7

persons convicted of a crime, but even more important than that,

8

we are not claiming, ., wish to be perfectly clear, we are not

9

claiming that the state is powerless to get at the kind of

10

person l:hat Mr. Just.ice Marshalls question refered to.
We say that the state can take certain action. The

11
12

firs~ thing that they can try to do is use the insallment method.

13

if that doesn't work, if there's no liklihood that the irstall-

14

ment method would work, t:ne kind of c1rrangements for working

15

off the fine over a period of time might be an alternative.
Now the ABA, the co!11lllission to study the Federal

16
17

Penal Code, all examine this extremely difficult problem.

18

Because on the one hand, as I've indicated the state should

19

not be po17erless to proceed against the individual.

20

On the other hand, the underlying principle of the

21

William,;, case, as I understand it, is that for the person who

22

is without funds to put him into jail immediately, which is what

23

happeneo here, there was no hearing, there was no exploration of

24

the possibility of using these other. techniques.

We say here that in a situation like this, theCourt

25
6

9

1

should deal carefully, to use the phrase that Mr. Justice White

2

used in his concurring opinion in the Morris case, with a man

3

who is without funds, not exempt him, because as I think the

4

Chief Just~ces opinion pointed out there could be a reverse

5

discrimination in the case of a person who's indigent who won't

6

be able to be proceeded against in any ~ay at all.
We are not claiming that. We 're saying that if a man

7

8

has, as this man had, fines totalin9 $425, or whatever the

9

sum would be, that the lower Court must deal with that parson

10

individually.
There must be a hearing, this also is suggested by

tt

12

the ABA and by the commiss:!.on to refonn the criminal law, and

13

deal with him in terms of his particular situation.

14

It's possible in this case for example, since he

15

was getting a vererans' check of, I think, of $104 a month,

16

that he would have been able to pay out the fine, say $5 a week,

17

or something of the sort.
The infinni ty in the procedurl? he.:e, we• re suggesting,

18
19

is the immediate transferrence of an individual who is poor,

20

to jail, ~,ithout: exploration of the various

2t

$hat were vi5Wed,in the Williams case

altermative methods

22.

Q

Well how did this get up to this $425 figure?

23

A

Pardon me?

24

Q

The $425 fugure. I would assume if he got $100

25

a month he could have paid the $2 fine.
i7
10

1

2.

A

and $104 a n:011th---

3

4

Well aparently---he had a wife and two children,

Q

Well, for example, he could have bought a little

less gasoline, and paid the $2 fine.

5

A

Well---

6

Q

And I could sug~est some other things he could

7

have done. I---

a

A

Well---

9

Q

I'd --- it with gasoline.

10

A

WeJ.1---

11

Q

But I mean a $2 fine is different from a $100

A

I think that's right, the problem we have on

12

fine.

1.3
14

this record, Mr. Justice Marshall, which is from another point

t5

of view ~s relevant to the question you're raising, is that the

t6

trial court did not do what we say is constitutionally required,

17

and that is explore the very questions that you.•re raising.

18

What we' re saying is that the lo\rer courts in these

19

situations cannot just take a person who hasn't got the funds

20

and put him in jail. Period.
We·re not disputing the implications of your questions

21

22

as I understand them, Hr. Justice. We're saying that as the

2.3

Willfams case said,

24

funds. That does not mean he should be exempt . I want to em-

25

phasize that again and again, because I think that's a critical
8

the- choice is illusory for a man without

11

t

factor in cases of this kind. But that the lower cou~t cannot

2

just take him and put him in jail.
That more is required by the: Constitution to fulfill

3

4

the mandates of the case as cited in Williams and the philosopgy

5

of the Williams case itself as I read it.

6

Q

And that more you say, Mr. Dorsen, could be met

7

by Texas if it showed upon investigation, find that this man

0

is not ab-1.e, to be sure, to pay the whole $'.125 now, but that

9

he can reasonably afford to pay $10 a month, because he does

10

get it---

11

A

That's correct.

12

Q

At the very least $104 a month from the---

13

0

That's correct, sir.

14

Q

The Ve~erans Association.

15

A

That is correct, sir.

16

Q

Whet:her or not he's employed, and---

17

A

That is correct, sir.

18

Q

So then they order him to do that. Then he aoesn'

19

pay the $10 a month, can they then put him in jail?

20
21

A

Well, we would say in a case like that, that

the court should then hold the kind of informal hearing--Q

Well, it's had the hearing and it's found that

23

he can afford to pay $10 a month, out of $104 ~month.Then

24

he doesn't pay it. Then can they put him in jail?
A

25

9

I would say th,1t' s a case of wilfull refusal to

12

t

pay, and they can put him in jaill.

2

3

We are not claiming a case like that and I think the
Chief Justice---

4

5
6
7

Q

not po~er to do anything but fine people, as you point out,
nonetheless, you conceed ~.hat under the Constitution it could
put him in jail if he didn't pay the $10 a month, right?

8
9
10

And even i:his Court, which under Texas law has

A

We would conceed that the wilfull refusal, and I

think it's pertinent in that connection, I'm glad that became
clear that---

1t

Q

---and help me out in this respect. I'd like to

12

change the facts a little bit. I suppose if the staaute were

1.3

only one sided, that for this offense, 10 days in jail, woul d

14

you be here then, rich or poor?

15

A

If the fine were onty $10?

16

Q

No, if there we,:e no fine. If the statute were

17

10 days in jail for this offense. The statute or ordinance.

18

A

I assume we would not be.

19

Q

You would not be here? I guess

my

question then

20

is, if you were to prevaiJ. here, in this lawsuit, would not the

21

resulting tendency in ordinances and statutes be to make all

22

these offenses punishable only by imprisonmnet?
A

23

There might be such a tendency. It's hard to

24

speculate about what would happen in each state, the fact of the

25

matter is, I think, Mr. Justice Blak:kmun, 1:hat many states now
10

13

I

provide for the kind of arrangement that we are suggesting,

2

and some of those, I understand, have not changed the law re-

3

garding to sentencing, but I would like to emphasize one other

4

point which is related to your question.

5

The state makes much of the point, and I think per-

6

haps one or two of the questions that have been asked indicate

7

a concern aboug it, but this is a scoff-law. That this is

C

low who is just oblivious to the restrictions that all of us

9

would feel are binding in connection with operating a motor ve-

10

a fel·

hicle, or a license.
And therefore perhaps he should go to jail. Now our

II

i2

position on that is twofold. One, that the state, as you suggest

13

can provide for jail ~entences, in cases of this kind. Repeat-

!4

ers, people who are chronic violaters. The legislature of the

15

state of Texas has not chosen to do that.
The second point, but we are emphasizing that that

16
17

wou~d be a perfectly valid mode of corrections! philosophy.

10

The second point we would emphasize on this problem, to use

i9

the word that the state uses, this scoff-law, is that if people

20

are going to go to jail, for being scoff-laws, rich people

21

should go to jail as well a; poor people.
That if a fellow were a playboy, a fellow who had
some money and in one way or another violated the traffic laws

24

of the state of Texas, and I assume there have been some people

25

who have done that, in Texas as well as in New York and in other
11

1

states, we say that the laws should be applied equally, to the

2

r ich and the poor.
Texas could decide to put them in jail. We are not at

3

4

all disputing that power. In this connection---

5

Q

What you're suggesting here, is that if you pre-

6

vail here, you may provide an impetus for just that thing, and

7

of course it ties in with the thinking of some people that one

8

of the solutions to our traffic carnage is to impose stiffer---

9

A

That may well be.

10

Q

---regulations.

11

A

I would not dispute that, is in the original

12

question. I might say, in connection with theterms of the states

13

interest, the state at several points, and very understandably

14

from its vJewpoint, suggests that this would be terrifically

15

inconvenient for the state to do.

16

Terrifically inc~nvenient to do the kinds of things

17

that the ~.BA has suggested, the~ the commisison to reform the

10

federal law, fh~ federal criminal code has suggested, that

19

Maryland new does, that Delaware does, that California does.

20

Now we sa~ that that is, that the inconvenience

21

problem is, to use the vernacular, a red herring. That all the

22

state already has a probation apparatus, it already has people

23

who are concerned with sentencing, the statutes of the state

24

of Texa& provide, incidentally, installment payments of fines

25

above $200 in another connection.
12

15

1

If you are fined above $200 and as a condition for

2.

probation, the court is empowered under the Te:r.as criminal code

3

to provide for installments, that the state doesn't find that

4

inconvenient.
And the American Bar Association which went through

5
6

all of this at great care, concluded that it is not too much

7

to ask, in the interest of equal protection, to treat the people

8

without funds a little bit more carefully.
I might say, I passed the point by, I suppose it might

9
10

have been implied in what I said, that this case is really like

ii

Williams in the critical respect that the maximum sentences

12

that can be provided in offenses of this kind is zero days.

13

Which brings it within ·che opinion of the Chief Justice and

14

the concurring op:~nion on the dua process theory by Mr. Justice

15

Harlan.

16

The amicus curaie, I might say, the National Legal

t7

Aid and Defender Association, which has come into this case,

t8

amicus curaie sutgests that this is even a worse case than

19

Williams, a more severe deprevation of constitutional rights,

20

because here you're not just adding to an existing jail term

21

whic:~ is substitutingjjail for a pecuniary penalty.
Q

22

23
24

What is the maximum total aggregate fine, he did

get up to $425, how much could be have been fined? A thousand
dollars?
A

25

It's not clear on the record. 'the maximum that

13

16

t

this Court could impose for any offense is $200.

2

Q

Per offense.

3

A

That's right. So $1800 presumably would have

4

been the ab&olute jurisdictional limit, but they may have ---

5

their limits --- that.

6

Now there is another aspect. to this case. It's not

7

a princi~al point, but we would like to stress it. It is thG

0

idea that exchanging a man's freedoa for $5 a day, strikes us

9

itself as being implicitly irrational.

to

When one thinks about how any person in the middle

11

class, or with comfortable means, or just not an indigent, would

12

feel about his freedom, and to translate that precious thing,

t.3

being perhaps the most precious thing we have, for $5 seems to

t4

us over the line.

ts

And of course the llmerican Bar Association in rather

t6

strong longuagc made a sinilar point in which it said, I think

17

it's on page 12 of our brief, that, page 16, 1•~ sorry, page

to

16 of our brief, saying it even uore strongly than we do, that

t9

'the exclusive use of a dollar-a-day ratio both presents the po-

20

ssibility of a brutally long sentence, and provides as a meas-

2t

ure ab arbitrary figure which makes no economic sense, and

22

which bearc; no relation to the factors which ought to govern

23

the choice as to the length of the sente11ce. •
Q

24

25

When was this statute --- in Texcs? is it some

statute •rem back· 14

17

1

Well, i t ' s a rather old statute,I believe.

A

2

Texas law a hundred years ago, in 1850 had a statute which pro-

3

v i ded for 5.nstallment of some kind, but was repealed---the

4

state will correct me on that. It• .i not a new statute in the

5

state of Texz.s.

6

Q

But I suppose you'd agree in terms of the econ-

7

omic argument you're making that ~t the turn of the century

8

$5 a day might not have been irrational,---

9

A

Well, that's corr'9ct. We're not making a moral

10

judgement on the legislature of Texas in enacting this claim.

11

I think perhaps notions of fairness have changed as well as a

12

decline in the value of a dcllar .
And it seems to me, that one court, an Ohio court

13
14

incidentally, held, we cite the case in that long ·footnote
on
-.

15

page 16, that $3 was irrational , we would say that $5 a day

t6

was just unacceptible in terms of fundamental and fairness--Q

17
t8

Those would be the same if it was a thousand

dollars a day, your argument would be the same--A

19

That's right. I'm just emphasizing this other

20

aspect which is a separate point, and is not, as you point out

21

our principal point.
Q

22

I construe from your argument that he could be

23

put on a state prison farm and required to work B hours a day

24

at a $2 an hour r,te, or something, perhaps something geared

25

to the minimum wages under the Federal Act--15

18

r

A

That's right.

Q

That he could al&o be put on a road gang, on a

3

construction job, or any other wo:ck under compelled statecsuper-

4

vision.

5

I think he could .:>e. I would not think that the

A

6

state should use that as its first alternative. I think it

7

should follow the recommendations made by the American Bar

8

Association, and the commission, that--Q

9

You say the state should follow, a;:e you then

10

talking in terms of advice to the state legislatures, how

11

can this Court or ~ny court give advice to the state legis-

t2

latures?

13

A

I did not mean to put

it that way. What I'm

t4

suggesting is that we deal here with the deprevation bf liberty .

15

It seems to us fully consistent with this Courts opiuions in

16

a variety of cases that the state should use the least res~ric-

17

tive means in enforcing its laws.

t8

Now this fellow, as we di5cussed earlier, happened to

19

be someone who was of a special kind, perhaps, but that does

20

not mean that he'& an outlaw, that he should be comdemned tot-

21

ally.

22

He should be given an opportunity to pay off. And he

23

::ould have, perhaps,

24

3econd principal point, and that ~s that the lower courts in

25

nd incidentally this is relevant to our

these cases, re&pectfully, have to hold some kind of hearings

16
19

1

some kind of proceeding to find out what's happening in these

2

cases. And it cannot be just mass produced justice and an auto-

3

matic incarceration. If I have any time left, I'd like to just

4

reserve a minute o~ two, if I may, thank you.

ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH G. ROLLINS, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

7

0

MR. ROLLINS: Mr. ehief Justice, and May itplease
the Court.

9

At the outset, we would like to discuss what this

10

case does not concern. It does not concern any troubles that

11

Preston A. Tate may have had with his lawyers. We think that

12

that is not in the case. Nor docs it involve any arbi~r ary

13

action on the part of the State of Texas in charging two dollars

i4

for a drivers license.

15

That is not in the case. •rhe case actually boils down

16

tbethe fact that this man, Preston A. Tate, ran a red light

17

in the city of Houston, and the policeman stopped him, and it

18

is part of our routine procedure they asked h im to show his

19

drivers license.

20

He didn't have a irivers license. He went into Cor-

21

poration Court, he plead Not Guilty, the jury fined him $50 on

22

one offense, they could have gone up to $200 . They fined him

23

$25 on the other.

24
25

That very same day, at
ran a £"top sigh and fortunat.ely a
17
20

6

:00 p.m. that evening he
pol iceman saw him and stopped

1

him and again he was arrested, and then subsequently, he ran

2

up a total of nine traffic offenses.

3

Did I understand you to say that Texas found him

Q

4

guilty of two oifenses for not having a drivers license on a

5

single day?

6

A

No sir, the day of his trial, the day that the

7

jury found him guilty and fined him a $50 and a $25 fine, that

0

same evening, the offense had occured a week or so earlier, but

9

on the day of h~s trial---

10

Q

··--and he was coming heme from his trial.

ti

A

I doubt it Your Honor, because it was 6:30

12

something p.m., and I don't believe that he would be coming

t3

home from

14

ran a stop sign and again was given a ticket, he wasn't arrested

15

And that is something else that we would like to point

a tr:ial, but nonetheless, it was the same day. He

16

out here, they say that he uas immediately and forthwith taken

t7

to jail. He ---over two years expired between the time of these

t8

offenses and the time of his !1abeas corpus hearing. And although

19

he rnight have had a wife and chil-:i at the time of the habeas

20

corpus hearing, ne had no children when he committed these of-

21

fenses, in other words there was enough time lag in there for

22

him to have fathered two childrem.

23

Sor. don't think the state of Texas has really been

24

forthwith on this thing. In fact I think perhaps if we were to

25

be critized we could be critized in dragging our heels and flOt
18

1

bringing this th~ng to a head before now.

2

Anothe~ thing in the Petitioners brief, they question

3

the jurisdiction of our Corporation Court, and r think he an-

4

swered h,.s

5

Court could put a man in jail after he had failed to pay his

6

installments.

OW?'l

question when he stated that the Corporation

Well now, if we can put him in jail after failing to

7

8

pay hos installments, we could---we would have the jurisdiction

9

beforehand, and besiaes, our Texas Supreme Court and Texas

10

Court ofCrirninal Appeals says the Conporation Courta and the

11

J.P. Cou~ts have the right to enforce their orders by incar-

12

ceration and I don't think that it would serve any purpose

13

to argue that further.

t4

The---

15

Q

16

What effort was made during this year or two to

collect the fines?

17

A

That, Ur. Justice Marshall, I don't know.

18

Q

Well now, at the hearing when he was sent aw3y,

19

what happened there, other than "You don't have the money, so

20

you go."

21

A

Yes, sir, that's it,,

22

Q

That's all?

23

A

Yes.

24

Q

Well, \10Uld it have been possible to find out

25

whether he could have paid it in installments?
19
22

1

A

Well---

2

Q

Obviously the judge could have asked one ques-

3

tion, can you pay this $10 a month, or---

4

5

A

There is no provision in our law for paying a

misdemeanor of this type out in installments.

6

Q

Is there anything in the law that prohibits it?

7

A

1---

8

Q

I would assume in this particular case, if the

9

judge had said on the day he was fined $75, you have got two

10

years to pay this $75, there would have been no question about

11

that, you could do that under the Texas law, couldn~b you?

12

A

Two years?

13

Q

Yes.

14

A

I don't believe, Mr. Justice Marshall, that---

15

Q

J:s that. what happened, it was two years before

16

they got around to asking him for it?
A

17

It was two years before ~hey---actually what

18

happened here, they had some capiases out on him, on some of

19

these .:,'·her subsequent offenses and they finally arrested him,

20

they finally ran him down.
Now whether we didn't run hard enough or not, I don't

21
22

know.

23

Q

Oh, you didn't delibe~ately delay it, I didn't---

24

A

No, sir. In fact he was, as I say, and I was not

25

on this case at the trial court level, and I'm not as familiar
20

23

1
2

3

with the facts as I should be, but my understanding is, that
there were about 7 capiassa working on him simultaneously,
our whole police department was looking f.or him.

4

Q

Did he ever open a defense for these cases?

5

A

Seven of them were nolo COJ?,tendere, and the two

6

that he plead not guilty on, two the jury found him guilty,---

7

Q

What was his defense?

8

A

I don' t kno11, sir, I don't know, but when a per-

9

son gets caught red handed running a red light---

10

Q

---what his defense was, or has been?

ll

A

In the habeas corpus hearing the only defense

12

13

· as that he was too poor to pay thefine.

8

To pursue Justice Marshalls question about in-

14

stallment payments, I assume Texas charges interest on its out-

15

.;;tanding fines, doesn't it?

16

A

No, sir, we do not.

17

Q

So at l~ctst he doesn't have $3 a month interest

18 ·c1mning on--19

A

No, sir.

20

Q

On that ten dollars.

21

A

And to continue with Justice Marshalls question,

22 :c don't believe that a justice of the peace would have the au23 1:hority under our law to set up his own little timeppayment plan.
24 :: don:t believe that when the law says that the fines shall be
25 ::ollected in a certain manner,! don't believe that each JP in all
24

1 of our many counties could set up his own little empire, so
2

to speak, on how he's going to collect his fines.
Q

3

I assume you also make the point that it's ~if-

4

ferent than when he was flrst picked up and convicted,, and got

5

$75 that the judge had said either this or you go to jail.

And this case, where by the time they got around to

6

7

him he had nine other charges against him, I think those are

8

two different cases. Don't you?
A

9

As far as equities, yes, but as far as the law is

10

concerned w~ think that---and the man could have---if he had

11

just obeyed the law, right there, none of this trouble would

12

have happened. But he chose to disobey the law, he chose to

13

:!rive without a drivers license for---he admitted on the habeas

14

=orpus 2½ years, and as of last week, he hadn't got a drivers

15

license yet.
And we don't think that, of course, as far as ·the

16
17

question of law involved, the degree of a mans perversity pro-

13 :~ably shouldn't have anything to do with it, but nonetheless,
19

it certainly should be something teat we should not be blind to,
Q

20

My point is thi'3 same judge does have right of

21

;Jrobation,
and do you not have a probation department in Hous..

22

·ton?

23

A

No, sir, not on this---

24

Q

No, but I mean you do have a probation department

25

A

The District Ai:torney does have a probation de-

.22

1

2

partment, but on this type of thing, the --- city ordinaace
which allows the judge to delay act.ion on the fine 30 days.

3

Q

I see.

4

A

Upon application of the defendant. He did not

Q

How do you distinguish the Williams case in last

5

do this.

6

7

term from your case?

8

9

A

Your Honor, i.:he Williams case, by the specific

language of the Court, and I think at least 10 times in Mr.

to Chief Justice Burgers opinion he emphasized that what the
11

Court was conderoning in Wjlliams was an instance where they

12

nad a statute wh.ich provided for imprisonment regardless.

13

In addition, in this same statute, 'there was a pro-

14

vi-.ion for a fine. And what this Cou:z:·t said, at least the way

15

I read it, and I believe that's what the concurring opinion in

16

the Schoonover case also said was their interpretation of it,

17

was that this Court said that when you translate a fine into

f3

equivalEcnt ja&l time, that that cannot extend beycimd the maximum

19

jail tine provided in the statute.

20

That was wha'i:. \las before the Court, they---I believe

21

~ou all said that you had a very limited question, and that's

.22

what you decided on.

23

But I was impressed by the number of times that Mr.

24

ehief Justice Burger, in his opinion, kept referring to that

25

circumscrjption of the case to cases where it extended the total
23

26

I

incarceration period beyond:the period set forth in the statute.
And in this case, this is a case where the only sano-

2

3

tion for violation of this statute was a fine only. We submit

4

and we think we have shown it in our ~riefs that in cases like

5

this that our other statutes which provide that upon failure

6

to pay a fine you may be laid out in jail at $5 a day, we think

7

these two 5tatutes should ce construed in pari materia, in other

8

words to show that the legislature'intended that the man should

9

not get off scott-free.
But, that if he would pay the fine, that's fine, if

10
11

he couldn't than he would have to lay it out in jail.

12

Q

Mr. Rollins, in the Appendix of the opinion of

13

the Court in Williams, last year, there was an effort to sum-

14

marize what various states did, and as to Texas, of course it

15

didn't purport to be complete, but it was recited that he made

18

the Defendant found guilty and finecbmnay be put to work or im-

17

prisoned for a·suffieient length of time to discharge the am-

18

ount. Is there a provision, a work-out provision under Justice

19

of the Peace fine, or--A

20

Your Honor, I can answer that for the city of

21

Houston, that we have an ordinance that provides that if he will

22

voluntarily go to what

23

at $7.50 per day,

24
25

24

\IC

call 011r P farm, he can work that out

Tate refused to go to the P farm, incidentall.

Q

Dees that appear in the record?

A

Was that in the "abeaa conpus, it's not in the
27

I

1

record,

2

Q

Well, that's rather an important aspect in view

3

of what was said in the williama case about alternatives, wouldn

4

would,1' t you til:.i.nk?

5

A

Your Honor, the, actually as far as principle is

G concerned, I don't see that there's any difference in incar7

cerati,ng him where he can just lie around in jail and talk to

8

the boys in the cell, or go ou·i.. and work on a prison farm.

9

Its---

10

Q

tt

the matter.

12

A

Well, maybe concievably take a different view of

Yes, sir, that's obvious, sir, but I-- -you asked

13

me the question cold, I can't see that---the principle is

14

that the man is being restrained obviously it would be in-

15

voluntarily.

16

Q

Mr . Do~sen certainly didn't argue that there

17

was anytting constitutionally unpermissable, you will recall,

18

and---

19

A

But I couldn't understand---

20

Q

---·that---naid he would agree with that, but

21

since all of the traatnent of th5.s difficult pfoblem has dealt

22

in t~T.'ltls of alternatives, it's convievable that even at the rate

23

of $1 an hour, which Texas allows, plus presumably some food,

24

on a worl. out day, you might have a different case than the

25

case you have without that evidence on the record.
25

28

1

2
3
4

5

A

Your Honor, did you say $1 an hour?

Q

$7.50 a day.

A

Oh. That's a city ordinance.

Q

That's roughly a dollar an hour and I suppose

they give the man something to eat whan he's doing this work.

6

A

Yes, sir, I can say that we feed real good.

7

Q

Well, that might be quite a different: case from

8

the one you have here.

9

A

Your Honor,· I cannot see the difference. The man-

to well, what would be the di.fference, then, may I answer that
st

question by asking a question?

12

1,'hat about a chain gang? And leased him ' out to a

13

private road contractor, and say that if you go out here and

14

work on this chain gang, out in the hot sun, well, we'll let

15

you off a lot sooner. I can't see the difference in principle

16

in the idea is that the man is being rest.,ained from getting

17

out in society.

t8

That is his punishment, and we believe that in a

19

cai:.e like we have here, where the legislature has stated that

.20

the sanction shall be a fine and another statute which we think

21

ought. to be construed in pari materia, that if he does not pay

22

the fine, then he has to go to jail.
We think t.hat that is entirely different and we would

23
24

submit, there's two e rly cases out of California which we did

25

not inch.de 1.n out brief but
26

29

would like to submit to the Court.

I

it's in re Wadley, in 23 Pacific 190, and ln re Rosenheim, 23

2

Pacific 372.

3

4

Q

Could you furnish us with a memorandum of those

A

Yes, sir, I certainly will, and Your Honor, I

so I---

s
6

would like to pr.int in the Wadley case,

in a concurring opinion

7

Mr. Justice McFarland mentioned that there, or classified that

8

there are three types of &anctions for misdemeanor fines: im-

9

prisorur.ent only, fine only, and imprisonment plus fine.
In in re Rosenheim, there was a situation very ~im-

10
11

ilar to the situation that was before you all in Williams.

12

And the Cnurt there, in the California Court, said that the

13

language of the statute had an ambiguity because if the legis-

14

lature had really wan·l:ed or had clearly wanted the fine to be

15

transmuted to jail time and added on to the imprisonment time,

16

they could bave clearly so said.

17

But that they didn't. And that the misdemeanant had

ya

a constitutional right for California to pursue its policy of

19

strict construction of the statute agains<= the state and for

20

the pr soner.
In whichcase, and they further stated that tf the

21

22

loose construction, that if tte state wanted in that case,

23

were followed, then it wa& possible for a judge to do by in-

24

direction what he could not do directly.
And I believe you all used that same phrase in William.

25

27
30

1

Q

Mr. Rollins?

2

A

Yes, sir.

3

Q

How long have you had your P farm orders?

4

A

Long before the times germaine here.

5

Q

Judicially noticeable?

6

A

Your Honor, in Texas, city ordinances are not---

7 our Supreme Court and our District Courts do not take judicial
8

notice of city ordinances, they do of city charters.

9

So in strictly legal point of view, I would presume

10

~hat a court could not take judicial knowledge of city ordin-

11

ance which sets up---

12

Q

13

---is to judicial notice doesn't necessarily go-

vern what the law might---as to judicial notice.

14

A

Well··--

15

Q

Why don't you supply us with a citation of those

16

ordinances or. copies of them, when you give the other citations-

17

A

Yes, sir.

10

Q

As the Justice has suggested.

19

A

Yes, sir. It is in the city code, and if the

20

Supreme Court can take judicial knowledge of

21

tom code well, the problem is solved.
Q

22

nur city of Hous-

Even if we can judicially notice those factors,

23

we can't judicially notice that the record in the habeas corpus

24

think you can.

4

No, sir, if it's not in the record I don't

Q

Is there any---was that before the Texas Appellati

Court, or---

5

A

Your Honor, r. don't know, I don't think it was.

6

Q

Well, I have no idea whether a motion to sup-

7

plement the record would be granted or not, but you certainly

8

are free to make such a motion.

9

A

Yes, sir, r will certainly do so, And Your Honor,

10

in what little time I have remaining, I would like to protest

11

very vigorously about this idea of making the state of Texas,

12

or the city of Houston, or any other state, kind of adopt, a---

13

I guess it's going to be something like the American Automo-

14

bile Association has for their subscribers.

ts

They

go out and pay the fine~ for you, and this is

16

all just part of the ser-~ice, We don't think that the Fourteenth

17

Amendment by the wildest stretch of the imagination could re-

t8

quire a state to set up a credit card classification of petty

19

crimes and misdemeanors.

20
21

Q

Well, a.re you referring now i:o the installment

A

Yes, sir, In other words, that's really what

plan?

22

23

youtre asking is that what he's asking is that the sherrifs and

24

the chiefs of police Just d~t ~p credits with prople like Pres-

25

ton Tate, and let him pay it out ac co much a month,
29

32

Then how---it's goinq to take the wisdom of Soloroon

1

and the sophistication of a computer that hasn't ever been
3

invented to correlate the mans family size, his personal sen-

4

sitivity, his, the value• of his car which he has commited the

5

crimes with ~nd all of that into a jumble and come out and

6

say that all right, no1,1, for ~•ou it's going to be $4. 75 a week.

'

Ana then does he propose that in addition to having

11

12
13

Solo~on sit in judgement on this then we have another hearing-say that th ve a $2 parking meter vtolation in the city of
Houston and! go down there and say I'm too poor, then are we
going to have a separate hearing on my guilt velle non, and
then another hearing on whether I was telling the truth when I
said I was too poor?
And if I was just about half right on the too poor,

14
15

16
17
10
19
20

21
22

23

25

well then is the judge going to have to figure out how we are
going to space those payments

obb?

And another thing; if we have these installment payments, the people arc going to start getting behind, that's just
human nature, then \le• re going to have all sorts of clvil rights
casco coming up abou~ the way our deputy clerks go out and try
to collect ~e fines. That they used harsh language, and we
think that this is just le~ding us to a --- bog that we never
will see our way clour of.
And I think that before we stretch the Fourteenth
I\Jllcndment ~omen something that clearly was not written in it,
30

1

I would like to leave in parting with the idea that the poor

2

people in Houston, Texas, outnumber the ri~h, they've got the

3

ballot and the suffrage and if they think the way we collect our

4

fines is wrong they can elect city councilmen and state legis-

5

lators to change the law.

6

That the poor people of Texas have not done so, would

7

be indicative that this law and the

8

not oppresive and is not unworkable. But expecially since the

9

Fourteenth A.>nendrnent did not have the---and I would like also

10

to point out that the same Congress that wrote the Forteenth

11

Ali-.endment was also the same Congress that passed on our eon-

,2

stitution and that we had to submit that Constitution and ra~ify

13

the Fourteenth Amendment before we could get back in the Union,

14

that same Congress that wrote the Fourteenth Amendment thought

15

our state constitution was all right.

way we carry it out is

16

And we submit that this is strictly a matter of local

17

concern, and thatiit would be beyond the wildest stretch of the

ts

imagination to require the state of Texas to, and the city of

19

Houston to set up this installment payment, but, Your Honors,

20

if you do, please tell us exactly how to work it. Because

21

the District Courts are going to be working overtime, each one

22

with a mutually conflicting subjective idea what a pro?er

23

installment should be and proper collection proceedures should

24

be, and I can see more three-man courts being convened all over

25

Texas and all over the nation ofor that matter, trying to deter31

34

1

indeK, or. whether we should go on the guaranteed minimum income, as an index for fiscal and penal responsibility, and

4

then Your Honor, I wo1.1ld like to add one thing.

5

What about the puople that just won't pay? We oqght

6

to have some right to do that, and we submit that this is where

7

the problem is, with our people and our legislators. Thank you.

Q

Do you have any law in Texas to provide for for-

feiture of automobilies

10

A

that are used by people constantly?

No, sir. A married mans automobile is not subject

11

to execution. l'le had a populace inspired legislature in the

12

early 1880s that took care of what the Constitution didn't

13

take care,of, and if a married man in ~exas

14

not to have a bank account, he can go free.

Mr. Dorsen?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NORMAN DORSEN, ESQ?

16

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

17

MR. DORSEN: 'Zhank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I think

18

19

first of all that some of the catalogues of alleged harms that

20

my friend from Texas has referred to are really unrealistic

21

and I would just refer tile quote :,:-athe:.: ti.an go into the details

22

cited in our br::.'~f. The Schoonfie,Jd, which is the Maryland case

23

that was back on ;:emand from the Morris and Schoonfield case

24

in which a Three Judge Court, there were only two judges sitting

25

but a Three Judge Federal Court reviewed in detail a Maryland
32
35

t

statute and showed, I think, very clearly, in that statute and

2

in the way the Court discusses it how this method of collection

3

can work consistently with Williams and with Illinois and witho

4

undue burden on the state.

s

I am advised by my co-counselor from Texas that the

6

P fa.rm that was referred to, that is r,ot discussed at -all in

7

the record, is not merely what I had first thought what my

8

friend from Texas it referring about, as I understand it from

9

Texas Counsel, that everyone goes to the so-called P farm, but

10

that people who work there, who agree to work, get $7 a day,

11

for working.

12

Now that's not t .he same thing that I was suggesting

13

before. Because what we were sug,;esting before was absent the

14

wilfullness pC"oblem which I certainly want to re-emphasize that

15

the state is not powerless under the Constitution to incar-

16

cerate someone who wilfully refuses to pay the fine, but

17

absent that---

18
19

Q

This P farm; is that P., an abbreviation for

"prison" or is it Pae, where they grow beef?

20

A

I think it's the first, the former. That---

21

we stand on the alternatives as discussed in the Williams case,

22

I want to be very clearaabout that. The installment process is

23

one process, and the work process is another.

24
25

A twenty four hour a day confinement is not necessary
in the absence of wilfullness
33

to deal with this problem. And as

1
2

I said a moment ago, the Maryland case and the ~laryland statute
I think make this abundantly clear.

3

Another case recently decided by the Supreme Court

4

of t:!alifornia almost unanimously, which is in the Appendix to

5

our Reply Brief, the Antazo case reaches the same conclusion.

6

I just want to clear up finally, in half a minute,

7

a tirning problem that may not have been completely clear, and

r,

this is my final point.

9

And that is that after Hr.Tate was convict!ed and

10

fined $75 in 1966, as far as this record shows, and there was

u

no attempt to impeach Mr. Tates testimony at the habeas corpus

12

hearing on this point, as far as the record shows he had no

13

way of knowing until 1968 that that money was due. His lawyer

14

had been disbarred, and his lawyer apparently

15

this case also to perfect the appeal.

had failed in

16

We think, in conclusion, Your Honors, that---

17

Q

--·-what Mr. Tates occupation is?

1(3

]\

r·.~m t,ot su:ce what his occupation was; he had some

19

odd jobs but I'm not sure what his occupation was.

20

Q

What kind of car was this, did it show that?

21

A

A Chr~•sler, I don't know the year.

22

Q

Does it show the model?

23

8

It doesn't show the model. But I was just going

24

to say in conclusion that we regard this case in the essential

25

principles as indistinguishable from the Williams case, and we
'34

t

therefore, respectfully request the Court to reverse the judge-

2

ment below.

3

Q

4

t:he case is submitted.

Tha_nk you Profes:,or Dorsen, thank you Mr. Rollins .

entitled matter was concluded.)
