ORAL ARGUMENT BY LEE A. FREEMAN, JR,, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

We will hear argument

MR. FREEMAN;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Courts

8

This case arises in the midst of several anti­

9

trust actions which have been brought on behalf of public

10

schools and libraries of parochial schools, seeking damages

II

for an alleged price-fixing conspiracy among numerous publishers

12

and jobbers in the sale o£ library editions of children's books

\3

to institutional schools and libraries.

U

This conspiracy is alleged to have lasted from 1959

IS

until 1967 when the defendants entered into a consent decree

16

with the Federal Government.

17

The damage proceedings on behalf of the schools

18

and libraries had been pending for approximately three years

19

and were consolidated before Judge Decker in idle Northern

20

District of Illinois under Section 1407.

21

Pursuant t© order of courts the plaintiffs:

22

initiated extensive discovery efforts, taking more than 100,

23

depositions of various personnel of the defendant.

24

efforts to obtain the evidence and the facts were frustrated

25

by the evasion, recalcitrance and prevarication of the witnesses

f

2

These

1

2

who the plaintiffs sought to depose.

„

As the District Court found

the witnesses were

3

deliberately evasive? the witnesses exhibited a remarkable

4

lack of memory concerning the critical events alleged in the

5

conspiracy; there was a great discrepancy between the grand

6

jury testimony of these witnesses and the testimony

7

offered at deposition four years later.

3
9
10
11

that they

There was also feigned ignorance by these witnesses
concerning the incriminating correspondence they had either
sent or received.
The lapse of time between the conclusion of the

12

Federal Government's proceedings, the grand jury investigation

13

and the depositions taken in these treble damage actions, has

14

obscured the recollection of these witnesses and has prevented

'i 5

and frustrated the plaintiffs from getting the facts.

Part of

16

this delay has been attributable to the defendants since this

17

is the second time that -the defendants have sought to mandamus

20

The first attempt was denied by the Court of

Faced with -this problem the plaintiffs moved for

21

and sit down and either with a tape recorder ©r stenographer

4

or with handwritten notes would ask the grand jury witnesses

5

what questions they had bean asked by the grand jury; what

6

answers they had given; what type of evidence they felt the

7

grand jury already possessed.

„

As the affidavits submittad by the defense counsel

They appear in our appendix»

In none of these, affidavits was

these materials were collected in order to advise the corporate

.

18

On this record the District Court rejected the

19

assertion that these debriefing statements were protected by

20

the personal attorney-client privilege0 with ©ne exceptioni

21

where the defense counsel5s affidavit had made out & case for

The District Judge further found good cause,

4

substantial need for the' production of these documents, over­

5

ruling the claim of work product.

6

\

On a writ of mandamus the Court of Appeals did not

7

disturb the findings, of the District Court, with the exception

0

that the Court ©£ Appeals held -that the attorney-corporate

0

client privilege should extend to all the debriefing statements

10

taken from employees of whatever rank inside the corporation.

11

Our first point in this proceeding is that the use

12

©f the writ of mandamus bythe Court of Appeals was inappropriate.

13

In ordinary production of the grand jury statements, the

14

District Court didfollow and apply substantial Federal prece­

15

dent already on the books and applied in other jurisdictions

16

of: Philadelphia v. Westinghouse, Garrison versus General

17

Motors, Matta v. Hogan.

18

The proposed rules of evidence, as the Court ©£

19

Appeals recognised, provided for a control group test pre­

20

cisely identical to that applied by Judge Decker.

21

that, hist the law of Illinois in which this Court sits, has

22

adopted a control group test.

Indeed, there was an indication

due to the fact, that the employees were not of sufficient

rank to qualify as spokesmen for the corporation!» that case.

3

The discovery order simply did not satisfy the

4

prerequisites for the use of mandamus»

5

charge here "that the District Court exceeded its jurisdiction

6

or abused its judicial power.

1

is that the District Court erred in ruling on a significant

There has been no showing on this record that there

21

22
23

24
25

There is no claim that trial strategies have been
revealed; there is no claim that the impressions ©r conclusions
©f counsel have been turned over,

indeed? the District Judge

was very carefuly in weighing the evidence as to each debrief­
ing statement and returned to the defendants the only debriefing

statement. for which it was ’ claimed a work product protection

2

of conclusions of counsel.
,

Only in the one instance where the document was

4

substantially* in the impressions of counsel* rather than

5

simply a narration of fact.

6

7

product claim»

8

In that one instance the District

Indeed* this case illustrates the possibility of

9

abuse that flows from piecemeal appeals of interlocutory orders

10

since this is the second interlocutory order whr^n has been

1.1

reviewed and the ease has been pending for & substantial time,

12

Plaintiffs have been delayed and Impeded in the pursuit ©£

13

discovery by these interruptions.
We contend that while mandamus is not appropriate*

14
15

for the Seventh Circuit to employ and we ask this court to

?6

decide that mandamus is not appropriate as a matter of

17

judicial decision supervision* that this Court* the Supreme

1.8

Court should still undertake to review the substantive issue

19

that is the attorney-corporate client — scope of the attorney-

20

corporate client privilege.

21

Q

Are w© bound to?

22

h

Well* the Seventh Circuit has created a

conflict among the circuits as — before the Seventh Circuit

23

>. A

24

precedent was all moving the same way and now there is

confusion created by the

2S

Circuit ruling.
8

1

1 don't think

s

that confusion could be erased by a decision that mandamus

2

inappropriate»

3

in ..........

4

There would still be a pronouncement of shaord
that they take that view of the privilege»

Moreover# the proposed rules of evidence that are

5

being now drafted# considered this very points the scope of

6

the attorney-corporate client privilege and we believe it's

7

more appropriate for that issue to be decided in the litigated

8

contest rather than passed on in this Court5s supervisory role

9

when it reviews these rules and submits them to Congress for

10

approval»

n

Of course# we feel that we are supported by these

12

rules since the proposed draft has come out in our favor and

13

has adopted the control group test as applied by Judge Decker»

14

In short# we £@@X that this case in the Seventh

1$

Circuit in the context it was presented to the Seventh Circuit

16

did not present a sufficiently exceptional circumstance to

17

warrant the use of the writ of mandamus»

'18

Q

Do you think that this falls within the —

19

A

Oh# absolutely# and I think that this is &

20

much stronger case 'than Will (?) to rule that mandamus is in-”

In Will therevas no opportunity for the Govern­

25

Q

That was a bill ©£ particulars# wasnet it?

9

A

1

Yes.

Judge Will ordered the Government t©

2

turn over a list of witnesses and the Government said that

3

it would prejudice 'their case and subject the witness t©

4

possible retaliatory action if the list was turned over and

5

perhaps result in dismissal ©f the indictment.
The court assumed that there would be no review

even from the dismissal and the indictment still held mandamus

not be protected®

24

We feel that the control group test, as applied by

12
I

1

tee District Court strikes an appropriate balance for the need

2

for discovery by a litigant and the rationale for the attorney

3

client privilege, tee rationale which underlies the traditional

4

attorney-client privilege»

S

1 believe all commentators recognise that the
privilege results in a suppression of information and needs to
be confined within the narrowest possible limits, consistent
with its purpose»
Consistent with its purpose tee control group test

9
10

recognises the privilege with respect to communications through

11

counsel for the purpose ©f securing legal advice by both

.12

corporate officials having the authority to direct the corporate

13

action taken on teat advice»
The function of the privilege is to protect counsel

14

15

— to permit counsel to give advice to the client and for the

16

client to act upon that advice, and we believe_that logically

17

that privilege should only extend to corporate officials who

18

respond to the attorney8s function as an attorney»
The person who acts on the advice is therefor®

protecting his communication»
The control group people, those people who can act

1

The Respondents have axgued that It very important

2

for the counsel to give adequate legal advice to secure all of

3

the facts and I believe this relates to your question, Mr,

4

Justice Stewart.

5

secure the facts constitutes a rationale to apply the privilege

6

and in this instance it may be far more important for counsel

7

for Harper & Row fe© secure the facts from the witnesses who have

But, we do not believe that the need to

8

testified from wholesalers as to the enforcement and maintenance

9

of a price conspiracy than to interview their own employees.

10

There may be far more damaging evidence developed

II

before the grand jury from other witnesses than from a corporate

'12

employe©.

13
14

We would distinguish sharply then, the distinction
the fact-gathering function of an attorney from the function

15

of giving legal advice and we believe that it is only a function

16

of giving legal advice which authorises the privilege to apply

17

to that communication.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Freeman, you may

ORAL ARGUMENT (Continued) BY LEE A. FREEMAN, JR., ESQ.

4

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

5

MR. FREEMAN:

6

In this case we are talking about

7

materials which have been assembled by corporate counsel.

S

These materials reflect factual information which should other­

9

wise be available by the ordinary processes of discovery; that

10

is, from corporate records or from the testimony of the

1!

witnesses themselves.
Unlike an individual, a corporation has no privilege

12

13

against seif-incrimination and, accordingly, the plaintiff

14

should be able to go forward and accumulate this evidence from

15

the oral depositions of the witnesses and from review of the

16

documents that exist in the corproate files.
Q

17

Mr. Freeman, I thought perhaps all you wanted to

IS

find out was what these witnesses testified to before the grand

19

jury.

20

A

No, it is much more than that, Mr. Justice

21

White, because, as the debriefing memos or statements which we

22

have received show, many of the witnesses did not tell the full

23

story before the grand jury; the grand jury did not explore

24

many of the areas which are significant to our case.

25

rather subtle matters, and when -—-

15

These are

1

Q

Your purpose just isn't to pick up conflicts

2

between what the witnesses said to the grand jury and what they

3

told coxm.se 1?

4

A

No.

Well<, that is one of the purposes, the

S

conflicts between what they told the grand jury and what they

S

told counsel,, but they also told counsel mere„

7

Q

Would that be enough of a reason?

a

A

Yes,

9
10

That goes to the good cause of discovery»

I think that would be enough of a reason, but we have much more
in this case.
For instance, there are meetings which occur every

11
12

month among the publishers, the publishers' sales manager's

13

meetings.

14

attend the meetings.

15

that they attended the meetings but discussed baseball.

16

their counsel, they go and say, "We all agreed to cut this

17

jobber off because he cut prices."

18

In the depositions, the witnesses say they do not
Before the grand jury, they go and say
To

There is a great difference in degree between the

19

versions of the story which appear in depositions in the grand

20

jury and in relating of the counsel, as well as the fact that

21

there has been a great lapse of time between the grand jury

22

investigation and the depositions we are taking in this case.

23

It has been four* ---

24
25

Q

Let me get back to one thing you responded to

Justice White, that you wanted these at least in part to find
16
i

1

out whether there was any conflict between their testimony

2

before the grand jury and some that might be given at another

3

time,,

4

the grand jury minutes?

Can't you get that if you are entitled to it, by getting

A

S

That would ba the discrepancy between a

6

jury testimony and a deposition testimony.

7

We have the grand jury minutes.
Q

0
9
10

grand

We do have that.

Welly then, why do you need to find out what

they testified to before the grand jury?

I thought that's what

you were narrowing on in responding to Justice White.
A

II

Welly there are two points that we need to

12

explore.

We need to find out, first, whether the witnesses told

13

the truth before the grand jury; whether they fully elucidated

U

the facts before the grand jury.
Second, we need to know what areas the grand jury

15
16

missed.

n

our brief illustrate that the witnesses came out of the grand

18

jury and said the examiner was right to the point of asking a

19

crucial question, but he did not ask that question.

20

asked that question, whether I would refuse to supply a dis-

2!

counting jobber, I would have had to answer "yes."

22

Indeed, the debriefing statements which we quoted in

If he had

Well, from those kind of statements in the debriefing

23

statements, we can then proceed and redepose the witnesses and

24

either impeach them or refresh their recollections with that

25

information.

It is quite significant to us, in the context of
17

i
i

this case, in a price fixing case where decisions turn on

2

very subtle factors, and. the information as to what occurred

3

behind closed doors in a darkened room among conspirators,

4

what phrases were used by those conspirators is very signifi­

5

cant, and that is why we needed the debriefing statements.
Q

6

Well, if you0ve got the grand jury minutes,

7

isn't that the better evidence of what they said in the grand

8

jury?
A

9

Well, 1 think — no, it is the best evidence of

10

Q

Isn't it true that he did permit the produc­

tion of some of the debriefing statements?
A

I think there may have been a limited number

to which no objection was raised,

12

Q

Yes, and those are in the record now?

13

A

Those would be.

14

Those were submitted sealed to the judge.

made his ruling, but the ones that were ordered for his use are

17

A

There was no objection to then,

18

And they are now available?

19

A

That is correct.

20

Q

Would you suggest that the contents of those

21

debriefing statements in terms of what they cover and what they

22

do not cover are irrelevant to decision of this case?

23

A

Yes,

I would,

Why?

A

Well? in the first place, it seems to me that

an attorney-client privilege has to be determined at the time

that a communication takes place.

despite the argument by Mr. Freeman.
Q

4

S

There is no such question,

I know, but what goes into deciding whether the

privilege applies?

6

A

Well, I would like to come to that in the

7

course of my argument, that the question is what is the nature

8

of the communication, under what circumstances was the communi­

9

cation had, what is the purpose of the privilege, does the

10

attachment of the privilege protect the interest of the public?

S

I

Personally, I tend to approach this from the stand­

6

point of a practicing attorney who for about 45 years has been

7

rendering legal advice to clients, and protecting them and fcheii

8

interests in court and before administrative agencies, and 1

9

look at it from a practical rather than from a theoretical

10

viewpoint.

11

namely, what is the application of this privilege to a corpora­

12

tion, I have to devote a few moments to a discussion of what

13

the origin and nature of the privilege is.

14

I think that to put the question in proper context,

Of course, the attorney-client privilege is not a

15

rigid, inflexible rule of evidence or of law.

16

founded ’upon justice and reason, which has accommodated itself

17

and must continue to accommodate itself to changing conditions.

18

When it was first enunciated about 300 years ago, it was a

19

privilege available only to the attorney.

20

It is a rule

As early as 1801, however, it was stated by Lord

2%

Elvin to be the privilege of the client and the public, and so

22

it has come to be regarded ever since, a privilege protecting

23

not only the interest of the client but the interest of the

24

public as well.

25

Originally, it was a privilege limited to pending

27

1

litigation, then to contemplated litigation, then to other

2

litigation, and as it accommodated itself to expanding con­

3

ditions it finally became a protection to legal advice without

limitation,,

Again, it has accommodated itself in this respect to
a changing world, and it has become increasingly directed

to

toward the protection of confidential information between an

It

attorney and a corporate client.

12

recent direction becomes clearer when consideration is given to

13

the question of just what the purpose of the privilege is and

14

just how that purpose can be best accomplished.

I think the reason for this

15

The purpose, I would judge, is undisputed.

16

universally accepted not only in this country but in all other

17

countries of the civilised world of whose judicial systems I

18

have any knowledge.

that every person, whether an individual, an association, or a

corporation, should be encouraged to seek professional advice

advice he will be more apt to conform his conduct, whether

23

personal or corporate, to the standards imposed by society.

11

it wholly impotent with the restriction which is suggested.

12

Namely, that an attorney be permitted to communicate in

13

confidence with only a miniscule number of persons in any

14

corporation, forming what is described as the control group.

15

Counsel argues that to go further would constitute an

IS

extension of the privilege.

of Judge. Kirkpatrick in the case of City of Philadelphia vs.

18

Westinghouse.

19

The control group test when enunciated by Judge Kirkpatrick in

20

1963 sprang full-blown from his own brow.

2!

it was known to neither man nor court.

22

He relies basically on the decision

Nothing could be further from the facts.

Prior to that date

On the contrary, the rule as advocated by the

23

respondents here had been consistently applied prior thereto.

24

1 think it is important that neither Judge Kirkpatrick nor any

25

of the limited number of courts which have followed him, nor
30

?

counsel here, have given any rationalisation of the application

2

of the control group test.

argument that has been made to date is an argument against the

propriety of the afctorney-clienfc privilege itself, rather than

of these cases was merely whether, assuming the validity of the

The question in each

It would appear to me that Judge Kirkpartick's

seems to be the main point here?

15

Again, just tell me what deterrent effect is there,

A

What deterrent effect is

I think, as I said before, that this gets back

16

to a question of human nature as much as anything else, and

n

regardless of how humans should act I am quit® certain from my

18

own experience that they do not talk as freely and as candidly

19

if they feel that the communication is not privileged, as they

20

would otherwise do.

Q

This is really in soma ways, you think, a

handmaiden of the privilege against self-incrimination, maybe?
A

No, I do not.

I think that the privilege against

25

but as far as I am concerned they are entirely separate things.

Q

And* none of the same values underlie the;

attorney-client privilege!,, you don't think?

4

A

Well, some of the same values underlie it, yes,

5

but as far as the privilege against self-incrimination is

6
7

concerned, it obviously doesn't apply to a corporation.
t
If you take the argument, it seems to me — or, the

8

question, I beg your pardon — that has been propounded to me

9

and carry it to its logical extreme, then what is the value,

10

why should you have the privilege against self-incrimination

31

if the employee is going to have to, except in a criminal

12

case.

Q

That is the meat of it.

The reasons are the

attorney-client privilege that you are talking about, that

indicate that although he is going to have to say the same

20

thing on the stand, nevertheless the lawyer shouldn't have to

21

say what he told him.

22

A

Well, I will be perfectly frank.

If I felt

23

that every time that I spoke to an employee or to a client

24

that I recognised that at some future date I could be .placed

25

on the stand and my deposition be taken and I asked, "Mr.

If I felt that that were the way that I were going to
have to practice, I would find it very difficult.
G

So it's really as much of this argument goes

to the impact on counsel as on the client?
A

I did not intend to mean it as such, because

10

I think that if I do not feel free — I mean, I hope that I am

11

of some benefit to my client, that it isn’t just a question of

12

protection after the fact, after something has been done.

13

think that any good attorney hopes that his advice acts as a

14

prophylactic as well as a defense, and I do not think that I

13

would be in an equal position to accomplish that without the

m

protection of the attorney-“Client privilege.

n

I

To me it is inconceivable that a person should be

18

required to supply his adversary with a paid investigator.

19

That is what it amounts to, because you are probing not only

20

the information that he receives, you are probing the advice

21

that he gives.

22

Q

Are you really saying that anything that

23

undermines full candid disclosure by client to lawyer is to

24

that degree -- inhibits the whole process?

25

A

I am saying that, and I had thought that this
30

was generally recognized.

privilege was no longer open to question and that the only

3

question was -- 1 beg your pardon# sir.

distasteful.

I think that there are some suggestions or inferences

I will state about five things.

I think that the

the interest of the attorneys throughout the country and the

documents, so that had respondents chosen to they could have

There was no other effective remedy
The court below not only

Obviously, a ruling after the documents were released
would not be an adequate remedy.

The information is gone.

Of even more importance to me, failure to review the

13

order of the trial court would have left unresolved in the event

14

of a verdict for the defendant, or a settlement, an issue which

15

was stated by the court of appeal to have substantial importance

16

to the administration of justice.

17

compelling is the fact that the court of appeals in Radiant

13

Burners in 1963 cited with approval the decisions of Judges

19

Lehy and Wizantsky in the Zenith Radio and United Shoe Machinery

20

cases, stating that in those cases the problem posed,

I think also particularly

"Where a

In both of those decisions the privilege was held to

protect communications between an attorney and employees of a

corporation who were not claimed to be, and in fact obviously

were not members of a control group.

generally has it within its power to grant mandamus in excep­

exists where it is exercised for the purpose of compelling a

has enunciated.

I consider this to be as important an argument as it has ever

been my privilege to make and I only trust that I have ade­

through their bar associations have shoi^n

MR. FREEMAN;

I will touch briefly on a few points.

We submit that it is not possible, as defendants wish, to

mechanically apply the individual attorney privilege to the

22

corporate context.

23

between individuals and corporations for purposes of thair

24

privilege against self-incrimination, and to decide the scope

of the attorney-client privilege, we must look at the purpose

all of the arguments which have been raised by the defendants
