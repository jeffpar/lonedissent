ORAL ARGUMENT BY STEPHEN A. GRANT, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. GRANT;

6

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court;

1

Twenty-»five years have elapsed since this Court,

8
9

in an opinion by Mr. Justice Black in Bell against Hood, left

HO

for another day the question of whether a violation of the

11

Fourth Amendment gives rise to a Federal claim for damages.

32

At-long last the question is once again presented to,; the Court

m

in this case.
Briefly the facts:

14

the name of the case, Bivens

35

against Six Unknown Federal Agents, really tells the story.

16

It began in the early morning darkness in November five years

’

17

38

ago.

The six narcotics agents with guns drawn, forced their

way into Bivens8 home in the Bronx andproceeded to conduct a

39

thorough and apparently fruitful search.

20

on him in front of his wife and children? took him away to be

21

further questioned and booked, as well as subjected to an

22

extremely thorough, humiliating search of his person.

23
24

25

They put handcuffs

At all times the agents acted without any legal,
authority without a search and arrest warrant.

After the

complaint against Bivens was dismissed, but too poor to hire a

lawyer, he decided to sue the agents for the outrage he

Circuit Court of Appeals considered thecomplaint not so

18

frivolous-

'

A hearing was granted and I was assigned counselAt this time the Department of Justice represen­

17

19

Fourth, Amendment was intended simply to bar the defensive

privilege for an unreasonable search and seizureQ

The judg­

The first issue was whether violation of the
constitutional right to be secure against unreasonable search

U

answer turns first on the intent, of the framers.

12

the adequacy of existing remedies to fulfill that intent and

13

finally, on the role of the court in enforcing rights secured

14

by the constitution.

20

important of all the command of keeping aware of the problems,

24
25

These words:

were a special mandate to the Judiciary that stood be­

This is clear from Madison's famous statement that
if the Bill of Rights were incorporated into the

4

\

1

independent tribunals of justice will consider themselves in

2

a peculiar maimer the guardians of those rights;they-would

3

resist every encroachment by the Legislative or the Executive.
The framers didn't say how the courts were to act

4
5

as guardians? how they were to resist the encroachments- that

6

sooner or later must come; they didn't have to.

7

members of this Court well know, the amendment itself is based

S

on one of the great landmarks of English Constitutional laws

Enfcick against Carrington, a civil action in trespass against

11

the invalid authority of a general warrant.

.

Lord Camden's ringing denunciation of unjustifi™

13

able government intrusions in 1765 was well-known to the

14

colonists in their struggles against the King's customs

15

officers prior to the revolution,.

16

noted several times, in the minds of the framers when they

17

drafted the Fourth Amendment.

18

It was, as this Court has

And with the Entick case in mind they were no

19

doubt confident that the courts would enforce the constitu­

20

tional guarantee by the traditional remedy of civil damages.

21

22

23

Q

Mr= Grant, do you know whatever ever happened

to the Bell and Boyd on remand?
A

Yes, Your Honor.

On bringing it to the Dis­

24

trict Court they claimed, the plaintiffs® claim for a Federal

25

claim was rejected on the' merits on the theory that if the
5

I

agents — - it was either claimed against the agents personally

a

in which cas® 'they were immune from suit? or if. it was a claim

3

against the government they were also immune on their sovereign

4

immunity.

S

Q

And no further appeal was taken?

6

A

It was affirmed,, I

7
8
9
10

b elieve, by the Ninth

Circuit and that was where the matter rested.
Q

It ended their appeal?

Do you have any com­

ment as to why this issue really comes up only in 1971 —A

I think that is an extraordinary question and

11

if I could I would like to reserve that for later.

12

that is one of the extraordinary questions in this case.

13

I think

Having said this much as to which I believe there

14

is no disagreement, the precise question becomes a presumed

IS

intent of the framers as to the applicationof the constitu­

16

tional guarantee such as civil damage actions.

M

Our position is that Federal Common Law is the

18

source of the plaintiff9s rights? that the constitutional

19

guarantee provides the basis in Federal law for all substan­

20

tive incidents of the suits, including the claim itself, whether

2!

there has been an unreasonable search and seizure, the measure

22

of damages, and the scope of the officers9 defense.

23

In saying this, I rely first and foremost on the

24

language of the

25

freedom shall not be violated," speaking in categorical terms

amendment, which says:

6

"the constitutional

of securing the fundamental rights and in no way suggesting a

1

2

more limited application such as

3

defense in the suit»

.

And I rely secondly, on the historical background?

4

■

. merely foreclosing a

5

on the very fact of the amendment's adoption at a time when

6

everyone knew that the common lav/ under Entick against

7

Carrington already protected against unreasonable search and

8

seizure„

9

The amendment nothing unless it elevated the

IO

common lav/ right to the level of a guarantee that could not be

11

negated by state or even Federal law»

12

a guarantee if it was merely a lofty statement of principle?

19
20
21

22

24
25

And it meant little as

a right without a remedy, dependent upon legislative action fox
its enforcement, or was otherwise subject to the vicissitudes
of state law.
How little, indeed, when we consider that the
Congress hasn’t acted in 180 years and uncertainties of
varying local rules the remedy for the state law has become
all but completely impotent»
The Government, however, argues ~
Q

Mr. Grant, when you speak of the vicissitudes

of state laws, I8m not quite sure what that embraces»

Maybe

some states would not -A

Vicissitudes in the sense that state lav/s

develop in response to different considerations in the area of
7

1

trespass and those considerations are more or>

z

in all of the 50 States»
Q

3

less developed

Well,, I would have thought that most of the

4

law of trespass developed in the state courts and very little

S

of it ever in Federal, courts'.
A

6

It certain did, Your Honors, but it developed

7

with respect, and I think Mr. Justice Harlan pointed this

8

out in Monroe against Pape: developed in a context where the

0

only question was the private right of action against another

10

private citizen.

11

particularly the question of whether you could only recover

12

for the damages, physical damage to property.
Q

13

And the facts, the measure of recovery,

Well, isn’t it correct that many states

14

provide -that statutes for cause of action against official

15

conduct that is conduct of officials, that is not authorized

16

official conduct?

17

'

A

If they do, which I cannot answer, when you

18

say is any of this ■— I do not know.

19

1 would rely

20

which state does and which state doesn't, and what principles

21

govern that cause of action as well.

22

But, if they do again

on theargument it happens to be a coincidence in

And it is precisely that element of chance in what

23

state they are in

24

and I don't think the Federal rights would prevail.

25

and what state happens to provide for if

The Government, however, argues that the framers

i

must have been thinking,, in procedural terms* merely of fore­

z

closing the defense of justification»

3

intended simply to bar a claim and unreasonable search and

4

seizure was justified in the name of the law, the argument is

S

weak at both ends.

If the amendment was

claims in equity, the amendment that provided this for one

type of relief, but not another.

law where equitable relief is the exception rathe£ than the

18

Surely this must be because the framers8 intent, in the

19
20

21

defense implies an intent on the part of the framers to vindi­

23

Yet, if absent congressional action state law were intended to

Q

1 take’ it you think that what is involved

3

her® is both whether

4

what the applicable law is.

5

A

the Federal Court has jurisdiction and

T want to make my position vary clears that

8

there are two questions that are very definitely raised in

7

this case, but I want to focus on the substantive law in par™

8

tieular and not —

9

Q

10

A

Well, certainly ~
and not when the case is decided.

To my

11

mind if the plaintiff had sued in the state court the law

iZ

that should govern this claim is Federal Latv, because it8s a

13

Federal right that he will be seeking to vindicate.

14

Q

Well, it wouldn't necessarily mean that

15

state law would govern if. the Federal Courts didn't have

16

jurisdiction.

17

there was no jurisdiction in the Federal Court but that in the

18

state court Federal law could govern.

In other words, that still Could be held that

19

A

It certainly could.

20

The Government's final argument is that the

21

framers could not have intended to create a Federal cause of

22

action because if they had the Federal Court would have, at

23

the outset, been given jurisdiction over

24

under the constitution.

25

the cases arising

The logic of this position compels the conclusion
in

i

that the Congress — had not intended to create any enfor­

z

ceable Federal rights on statutes until 1875 when the original

3

jurisdiction was finally granted»

4

The framers and Congress assumed that the Federal rights would;

5

be enforced in the state courts,.

6

this enforcement ©f the Fourth Amendment was assured by the

7

then accepted, omnipresence of the common law»

8
9

Obviously this wasn’t true.

And the effectiveness of

For, when the amendment was adopted Entick against
Carrington was assumed to be the common law throughout the

10

land»

1!

original Federal jurisdiction and the state courts couldbe

12

expected to enforce the principles of Entick with'the ■-uni­

13

formity derived from common custom and tradition.

14

There could hardly have been any compelling need for

Indeed, there was little need to distinguish

15

between state and Federal common law rights, for well over a

16

century afterward, when umrer the philosophy of Swift against

17

Tyson, the common law was regarded as a single and cohesive

18

body of principles»

19

This is why Slocum against Mayberry, on v?hich the

20

government heavily religs for its view»

22

court, what Chief Justice Marshall did say was that damages

23

were to be sought in a essuit at common lav?," but that the

24

He went on to say that the suit had to, therefore,

3

be brought in the state courts»

4

ment's suggestion, what he did, not say was that the claim

s

therefore arose under and was governed by state law.

6

and indeed, for the court for many years afterwards, such a

7

parochial dissection of the common law was unthinkable, and

3

thus it is that the question of governing law becomes vital

9

only when a common law becomes what the courts say it is in

But, contrary to the govern­

fact»

When, under Erie against Tompkins the pronouncements

11

of state judges are:recognised as binding in the Federal

12

Courts and when asserting that the claim arises under .and is

governed by state'law may defeat the Federal right»

.

f

14

And in this context

' \

I repeat, in this context,

15

looking at the language and the background of the Fourth Amend-

16

merit, it is inconceivable that the framers should have inten­

\7

ded its enforcement to be subject to compromise in the state

18

law and the rights recognized in Enfcick against Carrington

19

forfeited because of Congressional inaction»

20

Turning to the second issue: the adequacy of

21

existing remedies»

22

ment, it is arguable, at least in principle that as a matter

23

of Federal law the court should look to state law in civil

24

damage actions for unreasonable searches until the Congress

25

says otherwise*

From the framers5 intent to its fulfill­

But, surely this turns most of all on whether
12

1

the framers6 intent would thereby be fulfilled»

The court

E

below concluded, that it would? that plaintiff should be left

3

to sue under state law because existing remedies substantially

4

vindicated Fourth amendment,rights»
With due respect, this conclusion cannot be

3
6

sustained»

1

Mapp against Ohio and Monroe against Pape* both of which re-

Q

quired overriding substantial state interest.

3

said in Mapp, existing state laws were worthless and futile.

10

It flies in the face of this Courts decision in

Because* as the}

Moreover, given Federal rules under the Civil

n

Rights Act against state officers, in the variety of local

12

rules, and this is the point in response to your question, Mr,

13

Chief Justices the variety ©f local rules from state to state.

14

It means that identical conduct in an unreasonable search and

15

seizure will give rise to liability if committed by a state

16

but not a Federal officer and if committed in one jurisdic­

r/

tion but not in another.

18

It leaves enforcement of Fourth Amendment rights

19

subject to the accidents of which badge the defendant is

20

wearing and on which side of a particular state boundary he

21

happens to act.

22

And in terms of the larger

question of deter­

23

mining police misconduct, the lower court’s conclusion cannot

24

be reconciled with the results of more detailed studies by

25

scholars in the field.

The most extensive work today, which
13

1

no doubt the members of the court have seen is that of

More important, fee cites evidence in Canada that

suggests the a civil remedy is reasonably effective in curbing

II

the police and strongly urges that such a remedy be given a

12

chance to do the job here»

13

Turning finally to the role of the courts s what

U

is the responsibility of the courts when an aggrieved citisen

15

enlists their aid fee vindicate a claim based on a naked

16

violation of the Fourth Amendment?

17

the Executive», insists the courts shouldn’t act»

18

and I quotes "that there must be a showing of the utmost

19

necessity? must be vital, indispensable, essential and absolute1 13

20

necessary»"

21

Of course the Government,
They argue,

*
In having themselves so restrictively set the

22

stage on the question to be decided, they proceed to argue

23

that ineffectual state remedies are nonetheless, not totally

24

worthless? that the matter should be left to a Congress that

25

hasn’t acted in 180 years»

14

s

To all this I would say only three things: first,

indeed, necessity must b©

Fourth Amendment rights requires the court to suppress

S

reliable evidence in criminal prosecutions at the expense of

6

society, surely it provides the basis for a simple court

7

remedy that would be available to t he innocent and the guilty

8

alike, and place the burden on the irresponsible police

officer where it more properly belongs»
Q

SO

shown for the courts to act,

Xfe

If the need to protect

What standard of liability do you suggest

IS

the courts fashion, if they fake on the job of enforcing the

12

Fourth Amendment directly?

13

A

Mr, Justice White, 1 think there are two

14

different questionss one is whether the plaintiff has a cause

15

of action and developing the Federal rule.
And one, which I think your question is directed

IS

to, which is the defendant's defense of privilege, which

17

should be sufficiently broad to protect the policeman acting

18

reasonably in discharging his duties»

19

Q

20

— the policeman believing that he had

probabl© cause or —

21

22
23
24

A

Yes, Your Honor, I would

—*

Q

Evan though he was quite

wrong?

A

Even though he was quite

wrong, if he

reasonably believed that he had probable cause that should be

25

15
i

I

a sufficient defense in my view, and I think that11 s consistent

a

with this Court4® opinion in Pierson against Ray.

3

think it's a separate question from whether the plaintiff has

4

a right feo sue, he has a Federal right that should be governed

5

by Federal rules.

S
7

Rut, I

That5s already —

Q

Els subjective good faith would be suf­

ficient defense, do you submit?

8

A

9

Q

Well, that5s the reason I asked the question.

10

A

I think that this is beyond the scope ©f

I don8t think I said that.

11

what the Court -- well, l3m not so sure? if the Court, goes on

12

to decide, which I urge it to do, that Barr against Matte©

5.3

should foe explained as applying to defamation with respectt©

14

its discretion within the outer perimeter of tha line of duty»

15

then it should indicate what the defense if government

16

privilege is in trespass.

17

And the basis for that defense is established by

!3

the traditional cases of trespass in Pierson against Ray, and

1©

that tsould be a privilege for the officer's reasonable con-

20

duct in discharging his duty.

21

good faith, and I don't think society has an interest in sub-

22

jective law enforcement.

23

held up to a standard of reasonable conduct, I think the police

24

should foe as well.

25

Q

How, that is not subjective

If the other people in society are

Is it the same
16

as would make a search

1

eoas titutionai?

2

A

No, it would not be the same test because —

3

Q

Not the same test?

4

A

I don't think it would be as strict a test

5

and also I think that when you take the practical question of

6

suing an officer who is trying to do his duty, for personal

7

liability in front of a civil jury that in effect, the test

8

would not ba as rigid as the court trying to apply these ~

9

Q

Well, this would be, in logic arid in theory.

10

You use the word "reasonableness," and that's the s ame word,

11

the same word that the United States Constitution uses

12

13

that makes a search constitutional.
A

14

I think the question now is the privilege of
'
the officer, which is a defense in a suit for personal

IS

liability, whereas the question, for instance, of the probable

16

cause, at least wh©r$ it has arisen for the most part, has

17

been in whether you can use the evidence against a criminal

18

in a prosecution and I’m not sure they are the same.
I wish I could give you satisfactory answer to

19
20
21

22
23

that.
But, 1 will move on right to the second question,
since 1 only have a minute.
On the basis of the complaint in preliminary

24

papers the government invoked the defense of governmental

25

privilege in the District Court, as well as in the Circuit

17

j

i

Court of Appeals»

2

far as sustaining the defense in the face of a clear and

3

conscious violation of tine const!tutiori, and they cited three

4

Circuit Court decisions to that effect, which I noted on pages

5

20 and 21 of ray brief»

At the outset I would like to make clear what, in
the government9s view is, and what is not involved in this
case.
First of all, we do not contend that the District

Court lacks jurisdiction under Section 1331(a) in the sense of

11

Bell v. Hood for a cause of action stated on one construction

12

of tli6: constitution and defeated on another.
The 'critical question here and the one left un­

20

the kinds of damages recoverable which is governed by Feder­
ally created law.
Qur answer is: noi basically because of lack of

21

necessity.

little later in the argument, is basically ineffectual as

24

most other commentators have suggested.

Indeed, the tort remedy,as I would suggest a

Essentially, the fact, of the matter is that the

criminal record or comes from the lowest economic levels of

It seems to us, as the writers have pointed out,

11

that other .remedies should be sought? perhaps against the

12

police, entity in terras of governmental liability, amending the

13
14

Fort Claims Act, perhaps.
Should administrative boards independent of the

15

police, be. established in the matter of police behavior? and

16

if such bodies are created, what are their duties to be?

17

these are the kinds ©f questions, it seems to me, that are

18

best suited for legislative determination and study ~

Q

And

Well, didn't the Congress, in passing 1983

20

and keeping it on the books all these years, turn over, in

effect, to the courts the task of fashioning a good many, a

22

good part of a Federal law of constitutional rights against

date officers?

24

Yes? and of course, I think that tends to

support our position that is that Congress, in 1983, as this

What I am suggesting to the Court is that the

notion, that the vagaries of state law, the differences in

ineffectual; are not really accurate..

have said, is that, wherever the case is tried, juries gener­

?

A

Well, I think you would have there, in a

2

sense, in which — and Xsd like to get to the second point —

3

the thing you have then, ifc seems to us, is the creation of a

4

constitutional cause of action.

5

Q

It's a cause of action for damages based upon

6

rights; that are accorded to you under the constitution.

7

you might have a cause of action for damages based upon the

8

rights that are accorded upon you by the common law of

9

negligence, if you were hit by an automobile.

10

Wow,

It doesn’t

mean it's a constitutional cause of action.

n

A

Well, it seems to us that there are defects

12

in creating that kind of remedy, even if it isn’t a constitu­

1.3

tional tort in that sense could Congress then change it* as

14

against Federal Courts?

And secondly -— for instance, if you

That’s

18

recognize the existence of this Federal cause of action, might

20

Again, it’s against Wheeler and Wheeldin, which is

21

was cited by this Court several years ago, where this Court

22

refused to apply that course of action dealing with the

23

granting of process and the Court pointed out in an opinion by

Mr.Justice Douglas that we’re not in the free-wheeling days of

25

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY STEPHEN A. GRANT, ESQ.

4

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

S
6

Thank you, Mr. Feifc.

MR. GRANT:

X811 make only a few remarks unless

there are questions from the bench.

7

First: when you asked if state, law governs this

8

crime.

9

District Court.

10

If state law governs this crime we will go back to the
.We're out of court, if Mr. Feit was correct

in saying that the shjtte statute of limitations bars the -~

11

Q

I gather the statute of limitations was —

12

A

I think we brought it two years--.after the

!4

Q

Another year.

15

A

And that's precisely the kind of question,

13

trespass.

16

and there are obviously other issues besides the damages that

17

would bear on the Federal right.

.

18

What is required here is not, as the government

19

ho strongly suggests, creating a new cause of action in the

20

sense of defining a new and certainly ' not a constitutional

21

tort.

22

Here, unlike Wheeler against Wheeldin, we already

23

have in the constitution a prescription against an unreasonable

24

search and seizure and the tort of trespass is as old as any

25

a common law.

This Court is asked to hold nothing more than at
38

1

such a time honored claim than trespass is governed by

z

Federal law and based on a Fourth Amendment violation»

3

what is required would not* again, as the government suggests,

4

freeze Fourth Amendment remedies in a mode that could only be

5

broken by a constitutional amendment.

6

And

What we5re talking about is not redefining the

7

Fourth Amendment, but about its enforcement in the matter of

8

Federal caramon law free from local rules.

9

could, consistent with, the amendment, be changed by legislative

Such common law

10

action.

II

stitutional right, there is nothing to prevent the Congress

12

from requiring the claim to be asserted, against the government

13

itself, or providing for indemnity for its officers.

And even if the righ/h to damages were called a con-

14

Finally, what we are asking would not, as worried

IS

the court below, lead down a long and uncertain road

in

18

creating Federal rules, for you would open a Pandora^s box of

17

civil litigation to vindicate constitutional claims.
The courts, and particularly the Federal Courts

13
19

responsibility to formulate their rules and to determine the

20

difficult question of which constitutional violations give

21

rise to damage claims, is already present under the Civil

22

.Rights Act.
Recognising the Federal nature of the plaintiff6s

23
24

claim here would be if the Courts later so wished, an easily

23

distinguished decision, resting as it must, not merely on the
39
i

1!

Fourth Amendment, but on the specific intent of the framers.

E

and on the background of common law that imposed personal

3

liability.
In concluding, I would like to return to the

4
5

question raised by Mr. Justice Blackmuns, to a thought that I

6

suggested at the beginning.

7

the fundamental questions in this ease arise to this Court’s ,

8

decision over 200 years after they were settled in England in’

9

Entick against Carrington, and, 180 years after the framers

For me ’it's extraordinary that

10

attempted to incorporat® the promise of. Entick into the Fourth

11

Amendment.
And, as- I said, 25 years after this Court so

12
13

clearly suggested the availability of a Federal claim in, Bell

14

against Hood.

'IS

does not lie in any dearth of unreasonable searches and

16

seizures.

17

judicial suppression for legally seised evidence.

18

The explanation, as the courts know too well,

Such abuses continue and apparently unabated by

Obviously there is something fundamentally wrong

19

in the understanding of the people and of the police as to the

meaning of the Fourth Amendment.

21

sense, the guarantee that can and will be enforced.

22

But it is, in the-'practical

If there is to be a change it will not come

23

from simply sustaining the right to sue in Federal Courts.

24

And, as the Government points out in its brief, the Civil

25

Rights Act was recognized over ten years ago, yet 'the use of

the Civil Rights Act remedies have been minimal»

18

Suppose-we were to hold that there is a cause

of action and Congress has a bill saying there should not be a
cause of action»
A

What would be the situation?
If this Court x^ere to hold that the plaintiff

had a right under the constitution for compensation for a
violation of the Fourth Amendment# such a law, I believe, would

19

be in derogation of the Fourth Amendment# but that doesn’t

20

mean that Congress doesn’t have considerable flexibility.

21

I pointed out, they could easily adopt a bill that would re­

All they would have tc

do would be tc modify it so the suit could be brought against

Yes.
