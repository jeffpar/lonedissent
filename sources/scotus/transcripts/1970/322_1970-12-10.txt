ORAL ARGUMENT BY DANIEL E. FARMER, ESQ.
5
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
6
MR. FARMER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

7
the Court:
8
This case raises the same constitutional issue as
9
•the preceding case: in re Burris, raised.

The question is

10
whether due process requires the right to jury trial in
11
juvenile delinquency proceedings.

However, the facts in this

12
case are somewhat different.

Both Joseph McKeiver and Edward

13
Terry were tried after the date of this Court's decision in
14
Duncan versus Louisiana.

Both were 15 years old at the time

15
of their trials.

Under Pennsylvania juvenile court lav/ both

m
of them stood the risk of confinement until they were 21 years
n
old.

So that at the time of trial a possible outcome was that

is
they would be confined until they were 21.
19
Unfortunately, the institutions in which they risked
20
confinement are far from being as attractive as those described
21
for the State of North Carolina.

The worst of the institutions

22
to which Philadelphia juveniles can ba sent is a place called
23
Camp Hill.

Camp Hill is a prison.

It has been described as a

24
prison by Justice Hoffman of our Superior Court, who for many
25
.2

t

years was an outstanding juvenile court judge„
Q

£

Welly returning to what Justice White raised;

3

in the previous argument that you heard, what's"' the connection

4

between the kind of institutions on the constitutional issue

5

involved here?
A

6

It seems to me that if it could be proven

7

overwhelmingly that there was no punishment, that in fact, the

8

juvenile court was an exact parallel to the model of, let us

9
10
11
12

say, a mental commitment proceeding, rather than the stigmatiding for the commission of crime and punishment type of pro­
ceeding that it is, there might be some question as to the
rights.
Q

13
14

more, is enough to trigger the constitutienal claim to a jury?

A

22

You don't think confinement'alone, without

I think it might be, Your Honor, but I don't

think I have to maintain that because I think it's so clear
from both the facts in Pennsylvania and the materials found in
the National Crime Commission studies of our juvenile court
system that, in fact, it is not a generally rehabilitative
system.

It closely approximates a system of finding out about

wrongs and imposing' punishment,
Joseph McKeiver was charged with robbery, larceny
and receiving stolen goods,

There are felonies under the penal

23
code of Pennsylvania,

Robbery carries an adult penalty of

24
imprisonment for up to ten years.

25
3

Larceny carries an adult

1
2

penalty of imprisonment up to five years.
Edward Terry was charged with assault and battery

3

and conspiracy.

4

carry•imprisonment penalties of up to two years.

S

Those are misdemeanors which for an adult

One of the contentions made by the opponents is

s

tliat juvenile court judges view their role in fact-finding as

7

something very different than their role when they are sitting

as juvenile court judges.

Well# how could he do it any other way when

A

So it's clear that the court's

It might be worse off# Your Honor.

All

■>

I

am

22

saying is that the process in the juvenile court of fact­

23

finding is almost identical# even in terms of the mental pro­

24

cesses through which the judge must go with what the judge

25

goes through in an adult bench trial.for the same crimes.

4

Edward Terry was committed to a state correction

institution; Joseph McKeiver was placed on probation.
Q

3

Did I understand you to indicate that in

4

Pennsylvania there is no effort in the juvenile court system

S

to protect the juveniles from the stigma that many times

6

attaches to the civil trials or convictions of adults?
A

7

Mr. Justice White, there is an effort to

8

protect them and results are somewhat spotty.

In Philadelphia

9

there is a serious problem created by the fact that the police

10

maintain a parallel set of juvenile records over which the

11

juvenile court exercises no control.

12

police department deems to be serious they release the infer-

13

mation.

So in cases that -the

The police can't maintain a parallel set of

records of what happens in the juvenile courts because they
don't know.
A

They do seem to know, Your Honor.

Q

You said the police have a practice of

releasing those records?
A

In juvenile cases which the police consider

major the fact that a person has been arrested and charged, his
past record appears in the newspapers.

I'm a member of the Bar

Association committee that’s trying to do something about that.
As far as we can tell that information comes from the police.
They don't deny it but they won’t corapiy with the committee8s
5

I

request to stop doing it,

2

Q

The police — I mean police make arrests of

3

juveniles all around the country and turn them over to the

4

juvenile authorities# and you are just saying that in Pennsyl

§

vania they make a record of that?

6

A

That's right, but their record also shows

7

the past juvenile record of this particular juvenile and it

0

also shows the dispositions of convictions.

9

Q

How do they get the convictions?

10

A

I don't know how they get the convictions,

Mr. Justice White.

What does it require in terras of con­

A

The law states that juvenile records will not

be open to indiscriminate public inspection but that the records
may be seen by anyone having a "legitimate interest."

21

Q

Does that include the military?

22

A

As far as X know it does.

23

Q

And it includes if any other police department

I

know that employers having

some kind of a legitimate interest, get the information they

9

know —

10

Q

Directly from the juvenile court?

n

A

I believe that they can.

12

Q

You have a separate juvenile court system,

13

don't you in Pennsylvania?
A

14
15

Yes.

It is a separate division of our Court

of Common Pleas, which is the court of general jurisdiction.

18

Q

Is that throughout the state?

17

A

NO.

18

q

Was that changed in the recent constitutional

19

revisions in Pennsylvania?
A

20
21

22
23
24

25

Mr. Chief Justice, the constitutional revision

had this effect; the county court which was formerly a court
of general jurisdiction, but limited civilly, those judges
became judges of the family division of the Court of Common
Pleas.

So that the present judges of the family division are

judges who used to be judges of the court of general
7

1

jurisdiction# but with limits on their jurisdiction„
The issue that seems to draw the most fire from the

2
3

other side and which seems to be at the heart of this case#

4

is whether or not a grant of the right to jury trial would

5

interfere in those distinctive features of the juvenile court

Q

What is your basic constitutional position

Hi it a due process a

• or are you saying this is a

straight and simple criminal proceeding and a Sixth Amendment
right must apply?
A

Mr, Justice White# 1 agree that the standard'

to be applied in deciding a constitutional issue is whether or
not fundamental fairness requires a jury trial in juvenile
delinquency proceedings.

So far as the argument on that point#

it seems to me that every feature of the fact-finding phase in
adult criminal cases which demands the right to jury there# it
also appears in the fact-finding phase of the juvenile delin­
quency process,
Q

But you aren8t saying that this is a
8

1

3
4

criminal proceeding and therefore the Sixth Amendment applies?
A

Mo, Mr» Justice White, that seems like an

overly simplistic argument.
The features of the juvenile court which distinguish

5

it and which, hopefully, will some day lead to it becoming a.

6

generally rehabilitated

7

socialised intake procedure and that is when an arresting

8

officer comes in with an offense he may he able to make out

system ares first, that it has a
--

10

court may decide that there will not be a delinquency petition

1

filed, that the case will'be "adjusted.

12

The juvenile court judge has a broad range of

13

alternatives available to him in terms of disposition of the

14

juvenile prior to the hearing.

15

nostic and evaluative phases of the juvenile court process at

10

that point and save some of the delay which the other side

17

seems to be so worried about.

Finally, to return to the trial itself, there is a

great deal of talk from the other side about jury trials whip­

trials interfering with the juvenile court judge8s ability to

22

guide and mould the hearings juvenile jury trials injecting

But those ideas have tremendous hdvdcative' power(?)
but when you turn t© analyse’"them in detail I think, it can he

9

,

1

seen that the — those notions of what the judge can actually

2

do are not. going to be adversely affected by the granting of

3

a right to jury trial.

4

In its brief,, the National Council of Juvenile

5

Judges suggested as its only concrete meaning to guiding and

6

moulding by the juvenile judge,, that the juvenile judge, will

7

no longer be able to make findings of delinquency on hearsay

Q

evidence.

9

cross-examination has now precluded findings of delinquency

10

based on hearsay evidence.
Q

11

13
14

But I read Gault, in its right to confrontation and

By "hearsay," I fake it you are referring

primarily to the traditional type of hearsay that was used in
,juvenile court by way of the judge acting on reports accumu­
lated by the social workers and others?
.

15

IT

Mr. Chief-Justice, I’m not referring — I8m

18

referring to that kind of hearsay, but the reports of the

17

Social workers and the probation officers, that kind of hear­

13

say would still be admitted in the dispositive phase —

phase,

just as they would if the right were not imposed.

But not on the determination offacts.
The heart —

—

Q

Would it b© fair to say that type of report
10

I

was widely used over the years by juvenile courts on the fact­

z

finding process?

3

A

That was the conclusion that was reached in

4

Gault and we still have a problem in that regard even in

5

Pennsylvania today because the court personnel hand the

6

juvenile court judge the social history folder of the juvenile

7

and oftentimes the judge doesn't seem to be able to keep his

8

eyes off the interesting things in that folder while the fact­

9

finding hearing is actually in process.

1©

That folder, by the way, is a very interesting

1!

folder because it's stored by family so that when he opens that

12

up he sees the social history, not only for the juvenile

13

before it, but for all his brothers and sisters*

14

Q

That happened in --

15

A

It's exactly correct,

Q

17

18

Do you suggest that that's not a useful part

of the process?
A

I suggest it's a very useful part of -the

19

dispositive process.

20

finding process.

21

22

Q

It's not at all a useful part of the fact

In this respect then you would move it to be

just like any other criminal trial?

23

A

In the fact-finding phase?

24

Q

Right.

25

A

Well, I don't think that
11

'the jury trial

1

compels any necessity for the trials to be public.

z

think that a jury trial compels any broader release of the

records of the juvenile.

5

able to enjoy and have jury trials too.

So you would stillj. I suppose P have the

7

juvenile present when you're choosing a jury and to the extent

8

that you need a large panel up there to get a jury why you're

going to have a lot of people knowing about the trial that's

10

going on?

A

Mr. Justice White* on® notion that occurred

12

to me to solve that problem is to try the juvenile by his

13

first name and last initial.

-

14

.

jj

To return to the point of the judge's discretion in

15

■the fact-finding here, the heart of his discretion, it seems

16

to me, the only real legitimate discretion he has left in fell®

17

fact-finding is this power to find that in fact the juvenile

18

has committed the act which would be delinquency, but to ab­

19

stain in. ih<s .social best interests of the juvenile, from enter­

20

ing on the record an adjudication of delinquency.

21

That’s all that a

So there isn't going to be

There is also talk about formality between rehabili­
tation in the opponent's brief»

I think common sense in the

10

scholarly opinion that's cited in my brief, makes it quite

fJ

clear that if we are limiting’our look to the fact-finding

12
13

phase there is not goijiif to be any rehabilitation during facti
finding» Formality or lack of formality in -the fact-finding

14

phase has no effect, really in rehabilitation at all»

Surely

behavior patterns which have been built up over a lifetime»

Q

Do you think there is any constitutional

obligation on the part of the state to give a different treat­
ment, different in any respect, to juveniles as compared with
adult offenders?

In short, could the states simply say they

are going to. wipe the juvenile statutes off the books and treat
all juveniles as adults?
A

I believe they could do that constitutionally.

Yes, Mr» Chief Justice»
Q

Could they do it if a majority of the court
13

1

should hold it is fundamentally unfair?

2

A

Ho, I don't think they could * Mr. Justice

3

Black, but it. seems to me that -the rehabilitative notion of

4

constitutional law that has appeared in some of the Circuit

5

Court decisions is an act of fulfilling a statutory promise?

8

not. whether or not there is an a priori affirmative duty under

7

the constitution to rehabilitate children.
I'd like to turn to the

3
9

question of delay because

that's the one which is broader and it's a strong argument

10

•that the grant of the right to a jury -trial will interfere with

11

rehabilitation.

12

created that there will be a long gap between when the juvenile

13

first enters the system and when the juvenile is tried and

14

with the rapid changes in his personality it will interfere

13

with rehabilitation.

It’s argued that such a backlog will be

I think that the brief of the Public Defender of

18

17

Washington, D. C. shows quite well that the experience in

18

states granting -the right statutorily has been that very few

19

jury trials are requested.

20

h&sbeen a very special problem.

21

requests for jury trials and a serious backlog has been de­

22

veloped.

23

belief that the backlog was created by the number of jury ferial

24

requests, repealed the right to jury trial.

In the District of Columbia there
There have been a lot of

And the Congress, worried about that backlog in the

However, on page 17 of the amicus brief of the

Public Defender of Washington they cite a professional manage­

2

ment study that was made of the District of Columbia Juvenile

3

Court.

4

clusion was not available to the Congress ~ the conclusion of

5

■that study was that contrary to the notion Congress had in its

6

mind when it repealed the right, that the reason there was a

7

backlog was because there was not proper calendar control? not

8

because there was a large number of requests for jury trials.

And the conclusion of that study was, and this con­

9

So, I think that in repealing the right to a jury

trial, Congress acted under a misapprehension of facts, because

11

it did not have that study available to it.

12

Q

Did that report on the District of Columbia

3

show a correlation between the requests for jury trials and the

4

nature of the delinquency involved?

IS
6

In other words, did it

show that jury trials were demanded in the more serious cases
and generally waived in the less serious cases?

5

1

A

The Duncan and Louisiana opinion, as I read

2

it:, the reasoning that jury trials were found essential to

3

fundamental fairness was that they were protection against, to

4

use 'the language of the opinion, "the compliant, biased or

5

eccentric judge, the overzealous or corrupt.prosecutor."

6

8

Q

But in your own views'-do the juries con­

tribute to accurate fact-finding?
A

That is my view, Mr. Justice White, and 1

9

think it*s supported by the research of Kalven and Zeisel in

10

their books "The American Jury," which is cited in my brief.

Thsir conclusion was that in a significant percentage of cases

Perhaps it is.

different results in jury cases than in the judge cases in the

Mr. Justice White, 1 would answer fchcit .question

this way: I think if we would look at all of the, statistics
16

of all trials —

Q

Suppose as a lawyer in your prediction,, would

you say you were going to.get significantly different results?
A

4

Yes»

Especially in the case where, in my

5

judgment, 1' had already limited the category of cases to those

6

where I had some affirmative reasons for wanting a jury.

7

limited it to that category of cases then I am very strongly

8

convinced that -there would be a sharp divergence in the results»

Q

14

A

Well, I think they are such close cases that

IS

there is a high likelihood that they could have gone the other

16

way with a jury»

17

the judge approached the fact-finding already knowing that the

18

juvenile had been convicted on a previous occasion of burglary»

19

That knowledge would have been excluded from the purview of the

20

jury.

21

thinking that a different result would have occurred,

the Courts
Starting with the decisions in Gault, Winship and
Duncan, I would submit to Your Honors that there is implicit
in the rationale of those cases the conclusion that jury trials
are not required for juvenile proceedings. ■
In Gault this Court said that due process of law
does not require displacing the substantive benefits of the
juvenile court process and this Court further said that the
features of the juvenile court system are not to be impaired
by constitutional domestication.
X think that what the Court referred to, as it
amplified its opinion and rationality in Gault was pirn- y
cisely this issue that is here today and the same court was.
present in the Winship opinion with the language that there was
19

1

to be no effect on the formality, flexibility or speed of -the

2

juvenile court process and as the juvenile court process was

3

taken up and come to grips with, it is precisely those factors

4

reserved in Winship which militate against the jury trial.
The same thing, I submit to Your Honors, is present

in Duncan.

In on© of '-she footnotes there is a reference to the

conclusion that there is no be no widespread change in -the
criminal process in the state and that this Court encompassed
and envisioned an entirely fair- process without the jury.
I -think that brings us right to the central question
which is presented in this case, as to what the difference
would be if there is a jury trial as opposed to a bench trial
in the juvenile process.

And 1 would suggest to Your Honors

13
14

that there would be a great loss in the imtimacy of the pro­
ceeding if you have a jury trial.

occasion when someone has complained about the military obtain"
ing a record and X know of no such request and X think it would
be the procedure of our juvenile court not to let anybody have
those records because X think that would be an improper dis­
closure under our juvenile court law.
But, this entire area of disclosure of records has
not been raised or litigated on the Philadelphia scene and we
have raised and litigated virtually every -- many, many issues,
involving the allegation of improper police conduct.
Returning, if X may, to the central question as to
just what kind of a trial you have with a jury, as contrasted
with the judge alone.

X would submit to Your Honors that there

If there is an occasion made of a sidebar conference there are

him and are to pass upon this question in terms of his very

7

Q

Well, Mr. Specter, assume that the juvenile's

9

juvenile and his parents say, "We still want it.5'

No, Your Honor, I would not.

that it is in his best interest that he not be tried by a jury.

that the juvenile gets a much better treatment the way the

with our juvenile problems in a. much better manner because we

to what Hr, Justice Douglas said in D© Backer versus Brainard,

7

when he pointed out that the juvenile court had not come along

8

as everyone hoped that it would because there was not the kind

9

of a municipal budget to handle the problems.

And I think

10

that when you evaluate the juvenile system and say that it was

11

a horrendous system and point to t he faults of it I would not

prisons for the adults.

But, when you com© down*to what

We have a back­

trasted with 1,400 for juveniles where we are currant.
We can give a juvenile an adjudicatory hearing in
two weeks in the City of Philadelphia, not only tried at the

If I'm not mistaken, many people who are

opposed to the trial by jury at all, both for adults and any­

body else, one of the main arguments is it costs too much.

Well, I do not believe it would be appro-

priate under our constitutional form of government to make any

shift frora the traditions on adult trials.

If we had jury trials in the juvenile

We have been attempting in Philadelphia for the last

IS

four years to get 30 additional judges for the City of

16

Philadelphia urgently needed and because of state financial

17

problems we cannot get those judges for the City of Philadelphia.

18

This may ba irrelevant in terms of the theory of constitutional

19

law? but it*s a very major practicality.

20

We have? in Pennsylvania today? a mandamus action

21

brought by the Philadelphia City Courts against the Philadel­

22

phia City Council to compel the Council to put up $4 million

23

to run gthe courts and we have gotten a judgment in the lower

24

court and it is now on appeal to the Supreme Court and there

25

is a ticklish issue of division of responsibility as to whether

and necessarily to increase taxes, but that is where we are in

the City of Philadelphia» And if we have the necessity for

juvenile jury trials ~ 1*m not going to say to you that itBs

5

going to overwhelm our system because that might be placing the

issue finances too high, but what I will say to you is that it

1

will leave the juvenile in much worse shape than -he is today

Mr. Specter* if 2 percent of your adults

Yes# Mr. Justice White.

-- and it follows from that argument like

it does in the context of the juveniles that you should dis­

4

pense with jury trials in the adult cases?

3

A

No# Mr. Justice White.

1 do not say that.

6

1 -think that our traditions are too firm in terms of according

Q

And in short you say that that two percent

that want the jury trial is an important enough consideration
to retain .the right?
A

>

Yes# X do.

I think it is important enough

12

and X think that 'the distinctions between the adults and the

13

juveniles# for the other reasons -that I have given# justify the

14

difference in treatment between adults and juveniles in terms

15

of our entire tradition.

And

16

And I would close on just that note ■—

17

Q

X notice that twice when you referred to the

18

value of a jury trial —■ at least twice# you did not say it

19

was good because it was constitutionali you said it was good

20

because it was traditional.

25

A

Mr. Justice Black# had X selected iny words -

with perhaps more amplification X would have rested it on the
constitution.

X thittfc it8s in the constitution because it is

in our tradition and X think our constitution has

embodied the

■tradition of our concepts of fundamental fairness and

39

1

justice.
Q

Do you think of course — I8m not talking

about this issue

tion should be enforced, whether it, costs much or little?

5

A

do you 'think of course that the constitu­

Yes, 1 do.

I do.

But I think necessarily

6

■that when there is an extensionof constitutional rights and

7

if the constitution is interpreted differently in different

8

eras that there is a necessary balancing process that this

9

Court must undertake and that it necessarily involves -the

Thank you.

Mr. Justice White, you have asked whether or not a

The answer is a

If you read the words ©f the juvehilo court

law the answer is "yes."
Q
A
is otherwise.

That8s what I thought.
But the clear practise of the juvenile court
The juvenile court has created for itself a

i

category which they call? and I quote? "determined."

2

when they write "determined?" across the juvenile delinquency

3

petition it means: the facts were found? but for sociological

reasons the juvenile is not being adjudicated a delinquent.

And when the judge does that it’s because

Yes.

But? as a matter of practice in

Pennsylvania? does the judge have the juvenile's record before
he makes -the determination of facts?

A

13
14

That’s correct? and there is no reason why

look at it.

It is handed to him and some of the judges
Mot every judge looks at it.

Q

It's up to

But at least he has it once he's made the

finding of fact?
A

There is a little pile of them beside-the

bench when the juvenile's case is called.

The clerk hands up

til© folder to the judge.
Q

Mr. Farmer? is it possible for a juvenile

judge to find that the young man or woman did not actually do
this act on which he is now being charged? but nonetheless?
mad® a finding -that the young persons are delinquents?
A

It's not possible? Your Honor.

Q

That’s not possible.

41

Then while I’ve

1

interrupted you? let me ask you one other questions

2

talk in previous colloquy about a plea of guilty.

3

formal pleas in the juvenile court?
A

4

Ho.

there was
Are there

There is a pretrial hearing at which

5

pleas-of guilty are received and they are bargained for and

6

when a plea of guilty is received at that pretrial hearing a

7

disposition is made right at that point.
Q

8
9
10

Is that guilty of being a delinquent or

guilty of "Yes? I did steal the money, but I sk you not to find
me a delinquent."
A

11

Since the plea of guilty always results in

12

a disposition, I can only assume that in fact, he is pleading

13

to the. legal conclusion of an adjudication of delinquency.
Mr. Specter spoke about four factors in the jury

14
15

trial was going to interfere with: intimacy# the role of the

16

judge as a father figure and special informality.

17

The record in this case is entirely reflective of

13

the practice in the juvenile courts# and the court will look

19

in vain in that record for any special intimacy between the

20

judge and the juvenile or any father figure at all claimed by

21

the judge.
As far as fact-finding is concerned# it*3 like an

22
23

adult criminal bench trial# pure and simple.
Mr. Justice Brennan asked what the. law of England

24

25

Justice Brennan, but I don’t know exactly what the mechanics
are of which court he’s tried in.
