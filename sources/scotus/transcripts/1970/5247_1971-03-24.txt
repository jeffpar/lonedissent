Mr. Lippman.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

S

MR. LIPPMAN:

(Presiding)

Mr. Justice Black; and may it

pleas© the Courts
This eas© presents the question and the effect:

9
10

of a constitutionally invalid death sentence construction upon

n

Petitioner^ conviction for rap© under the District of Columbia

12

rape statute where the evidence of guilt was not compelling.
Briefly the facts :

13

Petitionerwas convicted

14

largely on the testimony of the complaining witness, who testi­

15

fied that she was on her way t© work ©n January 22f 19S1 at

16

St. Elisabeth's Hospital? that bar ear broke down in front of

She went to the gas station to seek help.

He volunteered to push the Petitioner's car to the
She accepted his

Upon
Open arrival at the parking lot she testified that

22
23

he forced her into his car and drove off.

Shortly thereafter

24

they stopped at a gas station where he purchased a dollar's

25

worth of gas.

'S

There was &n attendant present.

2

She mad© no

outcrye si© effort whatsoever t© seek the assistances of the

2

attendant»

They then drove; off to a secluded spot; they

parked for a «hile»

said “yea."

6

"no.”

7

ceeded to do so without ar,.y protest» following which an act of

8

intercourse took place.

Ee asked whether she was married»

She

He asked whether she loved her husband.

She said

He then asked her to remove her underclothes.

She pro­

After the act ©f intercourse» at her request lie

drove her back to the door to the St. Elizabeth's parking lot.

11

She gave him her car keys? he gave her his correct phone num-

12

ber.

He promised to return that afternoon t© help start her

13

car.

He did return that afternoon and was promptly arrested

14

and charged with rape.

15

Throughout the entire episode the complaining

10

witness offered no protest ar resistance by word or action be­

17

cause» she said» "she was in fear for her life."

18

that she suffered from a thyroid condition» but no medical

19

testimony was adduced to corroborate this point.

20

She testified

The complaining witness was unmarked? there was

2!

no evidence of fore©» other than her own testimony that she was

22

in fear for ter life.

23

Petitioner took the stand in his own defense»

24

admitted that he pushed the complaining witness's car to the

23

lot, but denied the act of intercourse.

3

Petitioner was

1

indicted and tried under the provisions ©f 28 Do C. Cod© 2881,

2

which is reproduced on page 3 ©£ ©ur brief, which gave the jury

3

discretion to sentence a defendant t© death for the crime ©f

4

rape „
■

5

At the outset of the trial the prosecution

6

announced that the case was a capital case, but that the govern­

7

ment was not seeking the death penalty.

8

was tried before a death qualified jury with on© juror being

9

accused heeuase she stated that her opposition t© capital

18

punishment would prevent her from returning a verdict of guilty
if, as a consequence. Petitioner might be sentenced to death,
Th© Court charged the jury that even though the
Government was not seeking the death penalty it was free to
sentence Petitioner to death if they found him guilty, and that
if they war© unable to agree that the death penalty should be
imposed th@y should really return a verdict of "guilty80 and the
Court would impose an appropriate penalty,

23

Nevertheless, the case

-

penalty was set forth at pages 297 and 298 of the appendix.
Petitioner was- found guilty and sentenced to a
term of imprisonment of from six to 18 years.

His direct appeal

feo the Court ©£ Appeals —
Q
A

Does the record shew hew long the jury was out?
Yes, Your Honor, Mr. Justic® Harlan? the

jury was out two and a half hours, I believe, or more

4

?

2
3

particularly? two hours and 29 minutes.
Q

Did they eos» in for instructions , supple-

mental instructions during that period?

A

A

1 donat believe a©# Mr® Justice Harlan.

5

His direct appeal to th® Court ©f Appeals was

6

pending when the Court, this Court5s decision in United States |

7

v« Jackson, 39® U.S. StO was; handed down.

8

panel returned the appeal and affirmed the particular convic­

9

tion with Sender Judge Fahey's dissenting opinion.

10

The Court of Appeals

Petitioner's conviction was again affirmed by the

11

Court of Appeals on rehearing ®n banc in a divided opinion.

12

Fourfe of the judges on the Court of Appeals dissented <®n the

13

grounds that the evidence was insufficient to sustain

14

Petitioner's conviction and. three dissented on the additional

15

grounds that Petitioner was prejudiced by the trial of this

18

case as a capital case.

17

If the Court please,, Petitioner here contends

18

that his conviction violates: this Court's holding in the

19

Jackson case and that he wm tried for a capital offense when

20

he should not have been.

21

■"

More particularly it is our contention that the

22

death sentence

23

choice ©f verdicts which night have resulted in a compromise

24

verdict in this case.

25

instruction gave the jury an impermissible

Petitioner's principal contention hare is

j

1

eloquently stated in the dissent of Judge Fahey below.

2

quoting his approval from the opinion of Mr, Justice Marshall

3

when then Circuit Judge Marshall ~ excuse a®. Your Honor, in

erroneous availability of the death sentence, not the likeli­

We have no'.basis for such a sur&ise.

And if is the

10

hood. of its rendition, that gives rise to"the prejudice.

14

©bout the crime of rape, reenforced by the statutory provision

15

for a death sentence, might have bean s® influenced, as stated

by the Second Circuit in Wilkins Supra 348 Fed 2d at 867; KIt

\
For the Court t© erroneously to give the jury

u

20

range of verdicts more severe than the law allows in the ease on;

ferial is for the Court.erroneously t© influence the jury

22

adversely to the accused.

23

may be more severe than otherwise it would have been, even if

24

not the most severe permitted by the erroneous construction.

25

Q

As a result the verdict rendered

89

Why do you say it was held to refer to the

1

death penalty?

2

h

We say it was there * Mr, Justice Black,

3

because the charge gave the jury a choice of three verdicts?

4

it gave them the choice ©f the verdict ©f!in©t guilty,” of

5

“guilty as charged,81 ©r guilty with the death —Q

6
7

the death’penalty?
A

8
9

Why do you say it was an error to submit

W© say it was error because, under this

Court*s decision in Jackson the trial of this case as a capital

JO

case, including the death sentence charge, violated the

11

Petitioner's constitutional rights and he was prejudiced there*»

12

by, Mr, Justice Black- —-

13

Q

What constitutional right?

___

14

A

Well, the constitutional right to which h©

15

was to be protected under the rationale of this Court9s

16

decision in Jackson.

17

to stand trial by jury, he was exposed to greater punishment

18

than there would have been if ha had waived his right to a jury

19

trial or pleaded guilty®

Jackson holds that he was, by electing

20

tod this was a constitutional defeat which held

21

the penalty scheme in the kidnapping act and the same scheme

22

that was incorporated in the D. C. rape statute.

23

jury, under the B, C, rape statute could sentence a defendant

24

to death.

25

to Jackson.

Only the

So to that, extent we have an analogous situation

7

1

2

3
4

Q

Am I correct that 1b this case 'the jury

found him guilty, period?
A

Yes, Mr. Justice Marshall; they returned

a verdict of guilty, but without the death penalty —

5

Q

Where do you get the compromise there?

6

A

Because the charge, Mr. Justice Marshall,

7

gave them an additional option; it gave them the right to

8

return a verdict of “guilty®' with fch® death penalty.

9

read the statute there are clearly three possibilities her©,

10

and the "guilty as charged" verdict could be construed as a

11

verdict of guilty on the lesser included* offense,

12

had returned a verdict ©£ "guilty*8 'with the death penalty that

13

could have been similar to aggravated rape? ordinary rape

14

perhaps guilty as charged.

15

Those were: the three options.

As we

if the jury

As the charge

18

clearly indicated, they had three possible alternatives here.

17

Hew, it is possible in that situation for one jury to feels

18

"well, let’s sentence this defendant to death;" another juror

19
20

'

to feels "Well, let’s acquit him®*3
Q

But they were only out two hours and 20

21

minutes; that was awful fast bargaining.

22

studies mad® ©£ juries that bargaining comes after many hours;

23
24
25

There have been

do you know what the stadias show?
A

Mr. Justice Marshall “*»

Q

I can see where a jury would says '’Well,
8

j

!

1

we can find manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter, third

2

degree murder, second degree murder, first degree murder or
y

3

first degree murder with the death penalty,.but where the

4

jury has the decision ©£ deciding whether or not he is 'guilty

S

of rape I don't see so much bargaining in there*
Q

6

1 suppos© part of your argument, is as 1

7

understand it that in a case -that divided the Court of Appeals

3

as closely as this one did, on whether the evidence was even

9

sufficient, the question of harmless error takas on a sig­

10

nificance. different from that which it would take on where the

1?

evidence was overwhelming.
A

12

That is entirely correct, Mr. Justice
✓

13

Harlan.

14

we're not arguing this contention in the abstracti we're

IS

arguing it with reference to tills close case of guilt*

18
17

X am glad that you made the point, sir, because

Q

Let me ask you this questions wriafc sentence

did this man get finally?

18

A

Six fee 18 years.

19

Q

Is he in jail now?

20

A

21

He is now serving his sentence at Lofton

Reformatory! yes, sir.

22

Q

How much of it has he served?

23

A

He has served three years and he is

24

25

eligible for parole in the fall of 1973.
We believe that the rationale of the Fahey
9

3

dissent has

indeed foaera adopted in this Court's ©pinion in

2

Price v. Georgia? decided last term»

3

subjected to trial for a capital offense and escposed to the

4

hazards of capital punishment, much the same as was the

5

Petitioner in Price v. Georgia, and that the death sentence

6

instruction here gave the prosecution the advantage of offering

7

the jury a choice,/ a situation which is apt to indue® a jury

8

t© strike a compromise, rather than to continue t© the debate

9

Ms innocence.

Here the Petitioner was

f

sbt if I may just respond, to Mr. Justice Marshall8 3

10
1!

observation a minute ago.

12

hours and a half? it's not a very long time,

It' ® true the jury was out two
it's c{uit®

3

possible to stipulate that they did not seriously consider the

4

death sentence, but it's impossible to rule out that possibil­

5

ity; and this .is wher© law ®m say by hindsight what actually

6

happened in that jury room as part of the jury deliberations,

7

so long as it was an option tendered in the charge to the jury?

8

it's got to be credited as a realistic possibility.
0

9

But we9re talking about realism, too.

It

20

is true that the Government said at the beginning of the trial

21

that they were not asking for the death penalty.

22

A

That is correct, Mr. Justice Harlan.

23

0

So I would suppose that's a factor that, in

24

weighing the whole situation here, should;.be taken into

25

account.
0

A

1

Again* the test is not as you would read

2

it or as X would read it, but as the impact it had upon the

3

jury.

4

Mr® Justice Harlan.

Let ms just read the critical portions ©f the charges,

Starting at the bottom of page 287 of the Joint

5
8

Appendix:

7

”21% however, you are convinced beyond a reason-»

8

able doubt that the defendant is guilty of the crime of- rape,

9

then fell© statute provides that you may unanimously do so,

\

/

10

recommend totthe Court that the death penalty attach,.K
.

The Government is not seeking the death penalty

1?
12

*— 1 repeat: The Government is not seeking the death penalty.

13

“But you may, if you wish to do-so, add the words 'with the
‘
death penalty® to your guilty verdict," if you find him guilty.

14

How, this following paragraph 2 regard as quite

15
16

critical.

17

Q

D® you think that was error?

18

A

1f@s, air.

19

Q

20

I
Do you think he was bound by the statement j

of the Government that they weren't seeking the death penalty?
A

21

Ko, n&d S think he had t© charge the jury

22

according to the statute.

23

the time.

24
25

That's what the statute provided at

Then he goes on to say: 852f you do not wish t©
have the death penalty imposed or if you are unable to agree

11

i

1

that the death penalty should be imposed, the you should

2

merely., return a verdict ©£ "guilty.15
Now, how does that language strikes the jury?

3

*

4

Isn't ha really saying — "isn't it a possible interpretation

5

that he's tailing the jury3 ’’’Well, if you don't feel this

6

erisae is heinous enough'or that the defendant should b® killed,

7

should be put to death* then just find him guilty."
Now, the jury retired tothe jury room with those

8
9

instructions.

Thera is no part of the trial which is of graver'

10

importance than the determination — than the guilt-determining!

11

process of the Court’s charge.
'

1

1 refer the Court respectively to the language of :

12
13

Mr. Justice Frankfurter in Andres v. United States, in his

14

concurring opinions 333 0.0. 740 at 765s "Charging the jury is

15

not a matter ©£ abracadabra; no part of the conduct of the
.

V

;

16

criminal trial is there a heavier task than on the presiding

17

judge.

18

bably exercises the weightiest influence upon jurors.”

19
20

2!

The charge is that part of the whole trial which pr©~

So her® we have a situation where the jury is
given an impermissible option — impermissible in the —
Q-

Why do you say it was impermissible if you

22

say the .judge had a right to give that charge mid was not bound

23

by tdie decision of the Government —

24
25

A

It was voided andmade an illegal charge by

this Court's decision in Jackson, Mr. Justice Black, by virtue
12

'<

?

of. th© statutory scheme

2

Q

You mean Jackson versus Denno?

3

A

Mo"r United States versus Jackson, the

4

United States versus Jackson.

5

Q

Does the record show how old this man was?

6

A

B@g your pardon, Mr. Justin Harlan?

7

Q

Does the record show hot# old this defendant

8

wasfafe tha time

9
10

I believe h@ was in his late twenties at

Q

Does th® record show the composition of th©

the time.

11
12

jury?

13

©r what?

Was it an all mala jury or partly male, partly female,

A

14

15

A

Harlan.

It was partly ml® and female, Mr. Justice

It was not an all-male jury.

IS

Q

Hew old was the victim?

17

A

The victim wa®, I believe, in her late

18

3©s ©r around 40? ©ad th© record also shows that they were the

19

same physical sise.

20

Q

Was ' this, an interracial *—*

21

A

No? they were both members of the Black

22
23

race, Mr. Justic© Stewart.
Q

What yon apprehend —

©r could

have

24

happened was that some jurors would say, "Well, he's guilty,

25

but if you®r©. going t© give him th© death penalty I Jis going t©
13

1

vote to acquit because 1 simply can't give him th® death

2

penalty, and therefor® the jurors agreed more ©r leas t© find

3

him guilty without giving him the death penalty.

4

sort of thing you are concerned may have happened?
A

5

Is that th©

My concern is that the availability of th®

6

death sentence option might have led to a compromise resulting

7

in tli© "guilty as charged" plea by giving a possible holdout

S

who wanted t© acquit to agree that h® would g© over t© th®

9

majority and find- feh® defendant guilty as charged, provided no

20

death penalty were imposed®
In other words, as a quid pro quo ?®r rejecting

it
12

th© death sentence, a holdout who wanted fe© ©©quit might have

23

b€5©n won over.
That's th® way we view 'th© compromise possibilities

14
25

here,

Again we're talking about possibilities, not probabilities

16

because I don't think it8® th© province of the Court or Counsel

17

or anybody as part of a rationali ration .after 'th© fact to say

28

what exactly was in the minds of the jury. This Court has been

19

circumspect and- ,refuse® fee do it — engage in such an action*
Q

20

.1 gather, under 'th© District system as it

22

then was? it's been changed sine©, but as it then was that if

22

everyone agreed h© was guilty he had to get life under a

23

guilty verdict unless everyone also agrees to give death? Is

24

tli at right?

25

A

X believe th© statute provides for

14

1

imprisonment up to 30 years

2

Q

3

Meli» 1 know there is, but my point iss

he couldn81 get death even though everyone agreed he was guity;
i

4

he could not get death unless everyone also agreed he should

5

get death? is that right?

6

A

That is correcto

7

Q

That's the way it works»

8

A

Yes»

9

Q

But there had to b® an affirmative recom­

10

It had to be unanimous either %?ay9

mendation ©f the death penalty, did it not?

11

A

It had to be a verdict of guilty with the

12

death penalty?

13

Q

Affirmatively; the jury had to affirmatively

15

h

That is right,

18

Q

If you had a situation where they were

i.

14

add

that.

17

unanimous that he was guilty, if there was a single holdout

18

then the only result would have been a verdict ©f guilt without

19

tli© death penalty? is that right?

20
21

h

X believe that's

a fair construction ©f

Q

Well, by 'the seme token, does that have

the statute.

22

23

any bearing on whether ®r not there vmm this kind of pressure

24

to compromise that you argue?
'' 4

25

A

I believe
15

again, Mr. Justice, it's

1

impossible k© say where the pressure comes from.

2

just as readily have been a holdout who wanted fc© acquit who

3

was won over to fell® middle ground because of the availability

4

of the death sentence

5

Q

Suppose it wasn't avallabe and ha just

6

upped and said ”no?"

7

penalty63 and they would give him 30 years.

8
9
10

A

All he had to cl© was say 68no death

I9m sorry, t don't understand the question,

Ms. Justice White.
Q

There might

All who had to do?
Well, why would on© juror trad© a vote for

11

guilty t© avoid the death penalty when all he had to do was

12

to just say "no death penalty."

13

penalty55 and they automatically give him 30 years? not a hung

14

jury, not a new trial, but 30 years, that's all he would get?

15

one person saying — well, he doesn't need to take anything

16

away to avoid the death penalty.

17

"no death penalty.M

18

A

Just one person say "no death

All the 'needs to do is say

There still might have been a way ©£

19

avoiding a hung jury.

20

as a method of avoiding a hung jury.

21
22
23

Q

The compromise might have been reached

Hell, but that wouldn't have anything fe@ do

with the death penalty.
A

Well, you are asserting, Mr. Justice Whit®,

24

that the difference in the reasoning ©f the jury — 2 cannot

25

really -g© ©a that assumption»
K5

I, think that under the statute

1

and under the charge that they were confronted with &,

2

package? again there were three possibilities.

Thank you.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES
MR« HUNTINGTONs

Mr„ Justice Black and may it

please* the Courts
The Governments basic position l:n this case is
that no prejudice resulted to petitioner from the trial of his
as a capital eas©.
Q

Are yen going to argue the fact that the

United States does not ~
A

W@ d© make that argument afesome length in

14

our brief end 2 had planned to refer t© it briefly.

15

it is set forth quit® adequately in our brief.

16

1 think

The main thrust of Petitioner's argument her® is

17

that the instructions to th® jury ©a the d©ath penalty issue

13

may have interfered with the jury's deliberations on the issue

19

©f guilt? and heavy reliance is placed ©a this Court's decision

20

last term in Price v. Georgia aid the 1966 Second Circuit's

21

©pinion in the Hetenyi v. Wilkins.

22

Both cases, of course, involve th® double jeopardy

23

problem' of -retrying a person for murder after he had been found

24

guilty only of the lesser-included offense «and -that conviction

25

had been upset on appeal.

18

The analogy Petitioner seeks to draw botween the

1
2

Fries said Wilkins situation and this ease ©re unfounded for

3

Several different reasons*

4

The first reason is that in each
"' '
of the former eases the murder chargewas one of the principal

S

issues,, that's the principal issue in the case.

6

tor had sought to establish first degree murder and the jury's

7

deliberations and the defendant's guilt in those caseswould

8

necessarily center in and focus on that first degree murder

charge.

Petitioner5® argument on the sufficiency of the

evidence really eats two ways heres he argue© that the evidence

did not really establish nonconsent, but we maintain that the

10

it is that th© Government would, that -the jury would seriously

11

consider imposing the death penalty.
Q

12

Could ■ I ask you a question?

Arcs you

13

arguing this case on th© premise that Jackson governs this

14

case# even though retroactively?

15

premise —

Are you arguing it on that

A

Well, this part of my argument is based on

18

Q

Based on that premise; I understand that.

19

Now, th© second question 1 want to ask yous ©n

16
17

that premise.

20

that premise you are arguing that this was harmless error, at

21

test?

22

Now, 1 read th® Court of Appeals* opinions and

23

I couldn*t find any advertent discussions ©n the harmless error

24

issue, except insofar as embraced and encompassed in the state­

25

ment that the ©th@r contentions were without merit; am I right?

20

1

A

2

Q

It did not...

3

A

But this whole argument I'm making now, I

That# s right? it did not specifically ~

4

think, supports the finding that Petitioner was not prejudiced ;

5

but beyond a reasonable doubt»

6

Well, now, turning to this compromise contention, ;

7

we believe that that is alse». — the, analogy with Price and

8

Wilkins does not exist.

9

case of first degree murder, second murder or voluntary man­

10

In Pries and Wilkins there was the

slaughter, and not guilty.

11

'

B@f©re the jury could unanimously return a ver­

12

dict of guilty of the second —> of the lessor-included offense,

13

which they did ii both Price and Wilkins — the juSrorls holding f

14

out for not guilty had to give up their insistence on that

13

verdict and the jurors9 fielding' out for the first degree murder

IS

had to give up their insistence! on that verdict.

17

there

18

So, obviously

was a possibility of compromise.
As Mr. Justice Whit® pointed out, the effect does

19

not exist here.

20

penalty issue s© that in order to ratum a verdict of guilty

21

it was not necessary that the jurors who might Slave . thought

22
23

that they should impose the death penalty, give up anything,
if
Obviously/they were in favor of imposing the death penalty they

24

would believe in Petitioner's guilt.

25

The jurors diet not have to agree on the death

So, the same dynamics that existed and the same

21

1

potential for compromise just don't ©Hist here.

2

Q

I understand the Petitioner's point to b©

3

that that second part of the charge could be interpreted as

4

telling 'the jury that you must has unanimous in order to give

S

th© death penalty and that if you are not unanimous on ‘the

6

death penalty

automatically you find him guilty.

A

7

WE13L, h® does make that point here? h© mad®

8

it in his opening brief and in his reply brief and he quotes

9

the first full paragraph at the top of page 298 of the Appen­

10

dix, Which does say that if you do not wish to have the death

11

penalty imposed ©r if you are unable to agree, then you should

12

merely return a verdict of guilty.

13

However —

14

Q

15

2 think w© both agree that that was rather

inappropriate languagej don't we?

A

IS

WE11, 1 think — in isolation you can put

17

that interpretation on it.

I think if you read the last two

18

paragraphs on the bottom of page 297 in conjunction with that

19

it's perfectly clear that the trial judge instructed the jury,

20

fi

t of all, to'.determine the guilt question.
Be s© saitf! thatfr “If you find him not guilty

21

22

that's the end of the case.®'

If you find him guilty then you

23

can go on and consider the death penalty which the Government

24

has not sought to impose and if you are unable t© agre® there

25

then you return a "guilty* verdict.

v

’•> i

22

2 don't really think .that

1

2

this charge is ambiguous in that point at all»
Petitioner also alleges in its brief -- h® didn’t

3

refer feo it in argument — Mr. Lippman didn’t refer to it —

4

tliat the fact that the jury was death-qualified may have pre­

5

judiced Petitioner on the issue of guilt.

8

Well, feo begin with, the jury in this case was

7

net truly death qualified in that the prosecutor did not seek

8

feo obtain a jury which would, determine the death penalty.

The

And this whole question feo the

On® witness was excused.

There ax© several decisions of this Court that

The Witherspoon ©as® s© held and Bumper and North

Petitioner waited until one «sir had parked and someone had

15

Q

Who alerted fcha police to arrest this man?

16

A

Well, as soon as it was reported to the

17

supervisor they reported that to the security guards at the

13

hospital and they then sailed in the police.

She did not make any complaint to the

police herself?

A

Well, she stayed with the supervisor and

The arrest was

<

A

That8s right. Your Honor.

25

Now, the evidence on fear, I think, is certainly

1
2

sufficient to support this verdict.

Mrs. Mayes repeatedly

3

testified that she was scared t© death and that she thought
.

4

Petitioner was going to kill her.

5

stated that if she didn*t scream he wouldn't hurt her.
l?h@r© is also some objective testimony in that she

Under all ©f these circumstances — I won’t

belabor the point — the resolution of this issue, we believe,

11

tli® Court ©f Appeals was correct.

12

First ©£ all, involving an interpretation ©£ the

13

B, C. Statute as it does, on the issue ©f law, this Court has

14

traditionally deferred to the opinion of the Court of Appeals

15

tin lotshl D. C. matters and we think that they should do so

here.
On the issue of facts the jury finding was con­

The final argument Petitioner raises her© relates

to the prosecutorBs characterisation during summation ©f

MR. LIPPMAN:

Just a few brief points, Mr.

Justice Black.
First, with reference to Mr. Justice Stewart 0s
comments with regard t© the evidence.

This Petitioner was

convicted ©si the basis ©f the testimony ©£ the complaining wit~
ness, which might have been corroborated with respect t© the

act ©£ intercourse, but was not corroborated, in our judgment,

with respect t© the consent issue *

Mow, the Court of Appeals in the Coltr&in case,

4

Coltraln v. United States, 418 Fed. 2d 1131, which was decided

5

after.this case initially, talks about the element of corro­

6

boration and all evidence of the defense.

7

that element, of corroboration was missing here.
Mow, if the Court pleases this record in its

12

of the Court of Appeals® opinions 5 to 4s it is particularly

13

true now what w@ hmm the issue of United States v. Jackson

Now, we feel that this case does come under the

,o

reasoning ©f the Price case, but we"re not asking this Court to

17

make a broad pronouncement of constitutional significance here.

18

This Court can escerelse its supervisory powers under the

19

Federal Courts and reverse this conviction if it feels

20

that there has been substantial error or substantial injustice
