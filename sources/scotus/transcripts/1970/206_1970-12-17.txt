ARGUMENT OF JOEL MARTIN AURNOU, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

6

7

MR. AURNOU:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

S

it please the Court.

9

on January 7 of 19S6 and subsequently charged in a two-count

The petitioner in this case was arrested

10

indictment with two identical counts of sale of a narcotic drug

11

to an undercover agent, the same undercover agent, two days

12

apart.

13

and three days before the date of his arrest.

14

15

And these two offenses occurred allegedly the day before

After his arrest, and the time factor is not found in
the record, he was removed to the office of the District
,

16

Attorney of Westchester County at our court house and there in

17

the presence of a number Of law enforcement officers, detec­

18

tives, assistant district attorneys, and so forth, and a

19

stenographer, a written statement was taken from him which does

20

appear in its entirety in the record before you.

21

However, that statement, it self discloses that it

22

followed a period of questioning, the length of which is never

23

disclosed, by the same district attorney, the same law enforce­

24

ment officers, and there is no place in this record where the

23

facts of the prior questioning are elicited.
3

1

It so happened that this case was tried before one of

2

our most beloved and respected judges* and when the statement

3

came up he* realizing precisely the point that was at issue,

4

the difference between the Miranda view of impeachment that I

5

take and the New York Court of Appeals view in the Kalis case*

6

asked the prosecutor who tried the case* who was the same

7

prosecutor who took the statement, Mr. Fa cel le* "Did you give

8

this man any warning other than appears in this statement?" arid

a

the prosecutor said he had not.

10

Q

Who was the trial judge?

n

A

Judge Robert E. Dempsey, Your Honor.

12

Now, what that meant was that coupled with the state­

13

ment itself* which shows you -- in repeated places the

14

prosecutor says to him, all I want you to do is tell us what

IS

you already told us before* and Mr. Harris -- well, he was 23

16

years old, he did have a tenth-grade education* such as it

17

was, he was an addict, and he was suffering from withdrawal

18

symptoms.

19

And Mr. Harris said, in the fact of the fact that he

20

had been questioned without warning and he was now being ques­

21

tioned by a reporter, he said !IX would like to see a laywer."

22

He said* "X donst think I should keep on before X see a lawyer.

23

And at that point Mr. Facelle told him that he had an absolute

24

right to a lawyer.

25

get a lawyer.

He said I'will have him taken out; he can

4

But the petitioner was indigent.

1

He had no prior

E

felony convictions.

3

in my view, and I don't think for a moment that he understood

4

either that he had a right to counsel then and there, or that

5

he had a right to free counsel then and there.

6

is —
Q

7

8

A

At that date. Your Honor, Miranda had not cane

Q

Right.

A

On the other hand, it is my view, and 1 command

to you, that Escobedo was in existence at that time —

H

15

As I understand that time he didn't have either

down and the standard had not been explicitly decided*,

n
n
13

Asid his answer

of those rights under the United States Constitution, did he?

9
10

He had minimal involvement with the law,

Q

Well, that is not a fact and not a matter of

A

— that the opinion which I believe Your Honor

opinion,

16
17

wrote said that a confession obtained under such circumstances

18

could not be used — that was the word you used, and I prefer

19

that to admissibility, because use and admissibility have some

20

distinctions in this ease.

21

he asked for the lawyer, it was not only a question of rights

22

that were available to him, because he didn't appreciate what

23

they were at all.

But what I am saying is thiss

But the prosecutor did.

When

L© and behold, when

4

24

you get to the end of this statement, the prosecutor said to

25

him, nBy the way, when you kept on going after you asked for a
5

i

lawyer,, you meant to waive a lawyer* didn't you?"

z

Harris said, "Huh?"

3

And Viven

He didn't understand.

And the young lady from New York County makes the

4

point in her brief that they explained it to him.

Well, they

5

told him what the word "waiver" meant but they didn't tell him

6

a thing about the consequences of it in that three-word

7

explanation.

8

be the situation'of the type of defendant that you have been

9

most alert to protect, one who is in no position to comprehend

So Mr. Harris found himself in what I believe to

10

or to appreciate what right it is he is said to have waived

II

because he doesn't understand the nature of it at the time.

12

Now, when you come to the question of fairness to law

13

enforcement officers, it is suggested that, well, as Mr.

14

Justice Stewart raises, maybe that wasn't the lav/ at the time.

15

I think that law was reasonably inferrable from v/hat this

16

Court had been doing, and I think the prosecutor did infer it

17

or he wouldn’t have asked him to waive it, which is the tradi­

18

tional way of trying to get around Miranda.

19

But something more important happened, and that was

20

the decision of this Court in Johnson, because on the day that

21

Mr. Harris came to trial, there wasn't any question about what

22

the law was.

23

cases, knew exactly what the law was and made the proper

24

objections.

25

respect him so highly — pointed out to the prosecuting attorney,

-

His legal aid attorney, trying one of his first

The judge -- and perhaps it is the reason we

6

?

he said, "if you do this, it will have to be decided in an

2

appellate court."

3

Q

Counsel, let me ask a further question.

I

4

haven’t had a chance to review the entire record.

5

claim anywhere along the line that the contents of the state­

6

ment are untrue?

7

h

Yes, Judge.

Is there any

I have to explain that in terms of

8

the respective positions, Justice Blackmun, of each of the

9

parties herein.

Miss Landau, in the New York County brief,

10

makes the unequivocal statement that as to one date it is true

11

and as to one date it is not true.

12

ment in the Westchester County brief that the jury must have

13

believed him or they would have convicted on both counts -ether

14

them solely on the stecond count.
Q

IS

Mr. Duggan-makes the state­

Well, this is my next question, is whether you

IS

are arguing prejudice in the light of the acquittal on the one

17

count?

18

A

Yes, I would like to explain my view on that.
!

19

Perhaps your question makes it the appropriate time.

I think

20

that what happened was this:

21

ence intrinsically as to the two cojants.

22

the statement indicated that Viven Harris had acted solely as

23

the agent of the police officer, that is the agent decided to

24

make the buy, the agent paid for it, Viven Harris derived

23

nothing from the act of being a conduit and in fact Judge

The statement had a vast differ­

7

On the first count,

'
1

Dempsey expressly charged the jury that If they found him to be;

2

an agent,, they must acquit.

I think that happened.

On the second count, however, it was unbelievably

3
4

damning in this sense:

5

was that he had in fact through a scheme and deception pro­

8

vided two.bags of a substitute for heroin, there was no heroin

7

in these bags at all, which he gave.

Petitioner's testimony at the trial

8

Q

It was a substitute for heroin?

9

A

I believe that is correct. Judge, but the point

10

was that he had just enough of a kick to deceive anybody who

11

was a snorter, which was their impression of what Detective

12

Bermudez was masquerading as.

13

Q

That he was.

14

A

However, the statement contained the suggestion

15

that not only did he get monetary payment for it, but he got a

16

taste of

It

meant that the entire

17

statement would be meaningless unless in

fact there was heroin

18

in those two little bgas.

19

heroin from those two bags.

■ How,. Mr, Duggan has suggested that it wasn't so sig­

20

nificant as to the second count because how could he refuse

21

the heroin that was offered to him without giving away the

22

game that they were playing.

23

find in this record that it was ever offered to hint.

24

find is that he took it in payment, but you do not find any

25

testimony that Bermudez, the detective, offered this to him

The answer Is that you cannot

ment.

3

He wanted it as far as appears from the state­

Q

I have trouble with the facts of this case* Mr.

4

Aurnou, but am I right in inferring these two inferences:

5

First* that the statement he made, the statement he made,

6

standing independently, was not in any sense of the word a con­

7

fession* wasit?

S

A

We disagree on that. Your Honor.

0

Q

Standing independently --

10

A

As to the second count --

11

Q

— as to the statement he made.

12

A

Yes, as to the second count.

13

Q

Tell me how was the confession --

14

A

Because it indicated (a) that he had furnished

15

the heroin, and (b) that by taking back the taste it 'was in

16

fact heroin that he had furnished and received money for, and

17

that is his the charge to the jury under the statute to be

18

sufficient to convict in Hew York.

19

But as to the second count. Judge, and I am limiting

20

myself to the second count respectively, X think in fact it was

21

a confession, but in any event certainly an admission.

22

you come down to that —

23
24

25

Q

I thought it was only when combined with the

testimony that he gave in court -A

And when

5

mony to demonstrate the possibility of falsehood —

Right.
-- either at the time of the prior statement or

at the trial*

9

Q

Right.

10

A

But it also had an independent evil effect of

11

its own as a confession, and I would not have you think I con­

12

ceived that —

13

Q

Getting back to the second count, at least?

14

A

Right.

15

Q

All right.

IS
17

How, secondly, is there any claim

here that the statement was coerced or -A

Unfortunately, Judge, that aspect of the record

13

was foreclosed by the prosecution*

How, Mr. Pajanski, the

19

young man who tried this case for legal aid, made such an ob­

20

jection, and he made it by referring to Jackson vs. Denno and

21

to section 813(fj of the Code of Criminal Procedure in Hew

22

York,- which is the statute dealing with a hearing on the ques­

23

tion of voluntariness.

24

and certainly New York County at least still takes the posi­

25

tion, that it makes no difference what happens at a

The prosecutor objected at that time,

10

1

voluntariness hearing because you can just proceed to impeach

2

him with it anyhow, even if it is involuntary, in a McNair

3

situation for example.

4

Q

I didn’t quite understand the

I heard what

5

you saidc but my question was is there any claim that it was

6

coerced?

7
0

A

Well, I am sorry if I have been wordy, Judqe, I

didn’t mean to —

9

Q

Well, that is what -~

10

A

What I meant to say was when we attempted to

11

raise it in New York, when we asked for a hearing on that

12

issue, we were foreclosed by the prosecution’s objection that

13

the result of such a voluntariness hearing wouldn’t prevent

14

him from using it, v and the trial judge, as learned and wonder­

15

ful as he was, he is a wonderful man, he agreed with that on

16

the authority of Kulis, but having read Miranda he told Mr.

17

Facelle that "you face the problem that the appellate court

19

may very well determine that this is not permissible," and of

19

course he had the dissent of Judge Keating in the Kulius case

20

and Judge FultE® subsequent dissent in Harris ~~ I shouldn't

21

say dissent, I should say concurring opinion, indicating his

22

adherence to the dissent in Kulius, indicates that there was

23

a great deal of authority and, as I think my brief has shown

24

you, every federal circuit court in the country that has con­

25

sidered this, and there are six of them, has reached the view,

.

11

i

•

which I respectfully espouse today.
Q

2

Well,, then, as to coercion, the involuntariness j

3

of this statement, do I understand it to be your submission

4

that because of the attitude

5

of the court was that even assuming it was coerced it could

S

still be used?

the prosecutor took,

the ruling

i

7

A

Exactly, but I also say —

3

Q

We should decide this ease therefore on the

9

hypothesis, whatever the facts may be, that this was coerced?
A

10

Exact 3.y*

I say further than that, I say that

11

when yon foreclose a defendant from proving involunfcariness,

12

it is ill to lie in your mouth to say that tbs confession was

13

voluntary, as the briefs continually urge, for that was the

14

very thing that we raised and were prevented from questioning.

15

And I would say to you that this was no light question that we

18

raised because the statement itself intrinsically bore evidence

17

of a very clever prior questioning which may well have been

!8

deliberate.

19

not given, thanks to Judge Demipsey0s solicitation of that

20

fact, and what happened was we had a secret inquisition, some­

21

thing in the nature of a subtle star chamber proceeding, and

22

then v?e proceeded to a recorded statement for posterity which

23

is the one we are not afraid to show to the Supreme Court of

24

the United States.

I have n© way of knowing.

But the warnings were

I think that is wrong.

25

I think it is very much like the cases where you haves

probable cause and search and seizure and then the police come

2

in and testify that all of a sudden defendants are dropping

3

things on the sidewalk in front of them, which they then pick

4

up.

3

not just an average police officer, but an educated man, an

S

experienced lawyer, deliberately interrogates privately and

7

then publicly, that circumstance is suspect.

It is too convenient, and I say when a district attorney,

12

which was an identical sale, and I subsequently had that dis­

13

missed during the appellate process for lack of prosecution.

I would like to discuss first, taking first the

that that was conceded all the way through the New York courts.

That was the first distinction. Your Honor.

14

Q

— search and seizure, wasn't it?

15

A

Yes.

What happened was in Walder

17

18

and it was that affidavit that was subsequently used against

19

him.

Mr. Walder

Now, I think your Simmons case clearly says that that

21

procedure is no longer permissible.

22

itself, and the language that any statement elicited by the

23

police during the interrogation may not be used against him.

24

I think that word means exactly what it says.

But I think that Escobedo

15

court, when the decision was made, that was another narcotic

A

Yes, it was, this was evidence of a prior offens e

19

of offense.

It has not been said that V'iven Harris did that.

But even if he had» I am suggesting this, that ^Mldar itself

8

sense that it was obtained illegally, namely he had to make it

10

It was only in the Simmons

thing which in turn was illegally sei2ed.
Moreover* I think, that if you could impeach him with

11
1.2

a signed statement, as the case is here, why can't you admit

23

the signed statement in evidence and then just hand it to the

14

jury?

15

think that the vice in Waider is that you are more concerned

m

with the possibility of a single instance of perjury or lying

\7

than you are with the myriad instances of vindicating the con­

18

stitutional right against self-incrimination and deprivation

19

of counsel.

20

I think what was done here was the same thing.

And I

I

I think one of the most unfortunate things that

21

comes about through the rules announced by the Hew York Court

22

of Appeals in this case is that when you take it dovm to the

23

level of your neighborhood police officer* he is going to say*

24

well* it doesn't matter if I make a mistake under the Miranda

25

rules any more, because there is always something I can use it

S

for.

2

Q

Wot unless he takes the stand.

S

A

I beg your pardon?

4

Q

Wot unless the defendant takes the stand.

5

A

Wo, I disagree with that because it also has
!
,

6

its value in discouraging him from ever taking the stand.

7

Q

Well, that is a fact of life, though, that if

a

you contemplate perjury when you take the stand, it is some­

s

what discouraging.

A

10

I &,onet think that is the only situation in

11

which it can arise, Your Honor.

That is the implication of the

12

respondent and amicus briefs, but I think of this:

13

when a young and inexperienced person is before the police,

ARGUMENT OF JAMES J. DUGGAN, ESQ.,

17

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

18

MR. DUGGAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may the Court

19

please.

20

by beginning rather than with a formal argument by answering

21

some of the questions that the Justices have asked, and perhaps

22

haven91 been answered to my full satisfaction.

23

I think I can perhaps be of more service to the Court

When Miranda was decided in June of 1966, the

24

prosecutor went over bis own statement and he evaluated it in

23

terms of the law by which he was obliged.

22

And we said to one

1

another forget the statement in the Harris case because we

z

didn't give him that fourth warning, so as a consequence when

3
4

the time came when in another case we would have served notice
\
on the defendant that we intended to use the statement as

5

evidence against him, we chose at that time not to serve any

6

such notice because it was not then our intention to use this

7

statement against him.

8

what in New York State has become a Huntley hearing on this

9

matter.

1©

So as a consequence there was never any

But throughout the entire progress of this trial,

11

everyone knew and everyone accepted that this was a completely

12

voluntary statement in the traditional sense of the world.

13

only fault was that by reason of Miranda it was no longer

14

admissible, and so as a consequence when at the time that this

15

statement was sought to be introduced for impeachment purposes,

16

and when I say introduced I don't mean introduced into evi­

17

dence because it was not ~~ at the time it was resorted to for

18

impeachment purposes and there was an objection raised, there

19

was no hearing then being sought on the traditional concept of

20

vo1untariness.

21

Its

The thought that was being explored by holding such a

22

hearing at that time was whether or not it was admissible, and

23

the trial judge said certainly.

24

statement is not admissible into evidence, because the people

25

opened and closed their case without ever having had any

Everybody knows that this

23

t

resort to this.

But he said in terms of people against Kulis(

2

which is the law in the state of Hew York, the inadmissibility

*3
W

of this statement has nothing t© do with whether or not it may

4

be used for impeachment purposes,, and he said therefore, gentle­

5

men, 1 am not going to have any hearing to find out something

8

that all of us already know-

It is inadmissible.

But granted the point and, as I say, ' it was granted

7
8

by all concerned, but it was a voluntary statement.

It then

9

certainly became the same thing that everybody had agreed in

10

the traditional sense was perfectly proper, because there was

11

a time at common law when the defendant was under no circum­

%z

stance allowed to testify in his own defense, and this was

13

thought to be basically so because a defendant had so much to

14

lose by a successful prosecution, and he had so much to gain by

15

a successful thwarting of that prosecution, that he was essen­

16

tially end by definition unbelievable.
Welly so far as I know, the first break in that comraor

17
18

law tradition came in Hew York State in 1869, and in that state

19

for the first time a defendant was allowed to take the stand
i

20

and it was there that the concept gre\tf up that no presumption

10

it was accepted in a great many jurisdictions, even to the

point of their saying that even if we adopt as a principle the

possibility that this man may be impeached by inadmissible

evidence, he invites that by taking the stand.

14
15
16

Q

What if this had been a coerced confession,

could you impeach him with that?
A

If this had been a coerced confession, it is

17

the people5sview and the respondent's view that it couldn't

have been used for any purpose, because the entire thrust of

the only thing we can tell this Court is that because if it is

a voluntary confession, its proof is greatly to be relied upon.

21

Now, if you conceive of a situation where we can’t

even rely on the truth of this thing, then we can't use it fco

confession, and let's assume further that it is wholly true.

19

Could you have used that to impeach him?

b

1 don't think so, Mr. Justice Stewart, because

21

the thought is chat we must define a class of confessions

22

which may be used for these purposes, and I think once you de­

23

fine the class as being a true confession rather than a volun­

24

tary confession, then you’re getting into extraneous matters

confession under three different decisions of this Court, and

15

you try to use it in cross-examination and defense counsel says,

Wouldn't you agree that then you have a hearing outside of the

11

it was not the voluntariness of the confession as to voluntari­

ness alone.

13

whether it was admissible in terms of Miranda, a question on

14

which all of us agree,

15

We had come to that conclusion months and months and months

16

before this trial.

17

Q

The only point that was brought into context was

there was never any doubt about that.

When the prosecution sought to use it fo1" im­

involuntariness of the confession?

This statement was never used nor was it arqued nor was it

Many times people do tell lies to the police, but have reason­

with a reasonable explanation for an inconsistent statement,

which is compatible with the truth of this trial testimony,

7

will hesitate to take the stand and give that explanation.

Nobody

And even beyond this, we Know? from experience that
defendants, where confessions are actually introduced as evi­

fO

dence of guilt, have never hesitated to take the witness stand.

II

It is not the existence in evidence of proof of guilt out of

12

his own mouth which keeps the defendant off the witness stand,

13

and there is no reason to believe that the availability not as

14

proof of guilt but simply if the man affirmatively resorts to

15

perjury that the availability of this statement to impeach him,

16

to expose to the jury that this may not be the truth will

17

deter any defendant from taking the witness stand.

18

Now, the situation In this case is different than

19

the situation in Bruton.

In Bruton the statement is introduced,

20

the co-defendant8s statement is introduced, not only for the

2!

truth of its content but it is used as direct evidence of

22

guilt against the co-defendant.

MR. AURNOU:

I would like to say first. Your Honor,

that somehow in the argument, and perhaps it is because my

10

brother, Mr. Duggan, was a little too enthusiastic, we lost

sight of the material which appears in the appendix at the

counsel says, "Your Honor, I take strong objection to the pro­

-- and the judge says, "Let the record reflect for you that you

r/

are taking an exception to the fact that under the Huntley

18

case, which is voluntariness, it was not offered on the basis

19

of notice required under the Code of Criminal Procedure, and

20

you also have an exception under the fact that it violates

21

Miranda vs. Arizona."
