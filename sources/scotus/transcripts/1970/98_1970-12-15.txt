Mr, Chief Justice and•may it please

the Court;
This case is in this court on a writ of certiorari

n

to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit,

12

This Court granted certiorari and limited it to two questions;

'13

one being whether

14

©f this Court's "holding in O'Callahan v. Parker# that crimes

15

committed by a serviceman within the United States in times of

IS

peace? must be service-connected if the military courts are

17

tohave jurisdiction.

18

the facts of this case follow in the scope

The second question presented is the retroactivity

19

of O"Callahan v. Parker,

20

an inquiry by this Court into extent of the power granted by

21

Congress under Article1 I# Section Bff Clause 14 of the Constitu­

22

tion t© vest courts martial with jurisdiction over the crimes

23

a. serviceman committed within the United States and during a

24

time of peace,

25

How, O"Callahan v„ Parker involved

0"Callahan involved the crimes of assault with
2

i

attempt to rape, attempted rape and house breaking.

2

Q

Was 0°Callahan on a military .reservation?

3

A

Mo, Mr. Chief Justice? the crime was com­

4

mitted within the City of Hawaii — Honolulu, Hawaiii 2 ha

S

sorry .

6

0sCallahan was off duty, out of uniform.

7

crime in that case was a civilian totally unrelated to the

8

military.

At the time ©f the commission of the crime the ~

9

Q

10

has any relevance here?

11

A

The victim of the

Do you think the military reservation factor

I do not, Your Honor.

1 might point out at

12

this point that the crimes involved in this case do involve

13

— there are two rapes and kidnappings and they were all four

14

crimes committee' on a military reservation, and that reserva™

15

tion being Port Disc, New Jersey, with the exception of one

16

kidnapping, which took place on McGuire Air Force Base, which

17

is directly adjacent'to Fort Dix, Mew Jersey.
Q

18
19

Do the civilian authorities have any juris­

diction on the base? any police authority, to start with?

20

A

The police authorities?

21

Honor.

22

probably have the police jurisdiction

23

I would imagine not.

Q

I don9t know, Your

They — the military police

1 would submit if it's not in the jurisdic­

24

tion of the court martial, it's in the jurisdiction of the

25

Federal Criminal Court, if it's a camp.
3

i

A

Wells, ii the question is whether, for in­

2

stance, if a civilian were 'to commit a crime on a military

3

reservation he is not subject to military jurisdictione

4

question was whether the state.courts or the Federal District

5

Court would have jurisdiction of that crime, I don't know what

6

the case is as far as Fort Dix, New Jersey is concerned,

If the

7

Q

Well, there is a case ~

8

A

Pardon me, Your Honor,

9

Q

There is a case which says that if the — if

10

it is Federal territory and they have gone through all the

!!

requirements to condemn it, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,

■12

and if it's a camp and if a civilian is involved it's Federal.

13

A

Yes, it may well b© Federal, but nevertheless?

U

I don’t believe that that means that the military courts have

15

jurisdiction over ~

18
1?

Q

I didn't say that.

I’m just saying the

state isn’t involved.

18

A

In this case it may well be that the state

'19

is not involved.

20

States where the state might well be involved because they a

21

have not ceded jurisdiction to the Federal Government and they

22

maintain

23

situations where the civilian authorities have jurisdictioni

24

at least that is my understanding of the situation.

25

There are military reservations in the United

jurisdiction over those military reservations in

Q

Mr. Detxipk., if these offenses had taken

4

i

place in Weisbaden, Germany , would you have a different case?

a

A

Yes? I think you would*

The reason I think

3

you would is -- there are several reasons I think you would*

4

Number one: under the practical situation required involves a

S

crime committed in Germany, if the courts martial do not have

6

jurisdiction over it you would, of practical necessity,

7

probably be tried by the host corn!try8g courts*

8

Now, in any event, under those situations ites not
/

9

going to foe granted the right to a jury trial, indict,r^afc- by

10

a grand jury in a civilian court of the United States, and I

11

think that the exercise of military jurisdiction in that situa­

12

tion may well be an exercise within the least possible power

13

adequate to the end proposed*

14

Whereas, if it were committed in the United States,

15

I feel that it would be without the least possible power, even

IS

though it was committed on a military reservation*

17

1 will point out, as the Court already has, the

18

distinctions between the 0'Callahan case and this case, are the

19

facts that the crime was committed on a military reservation

20

in this case, where it was not in 09Callahan and also this time

21

one of the crimes was committed against a military dependent

22

and that she was the wife ©f a member of the Air Force and she

23

also worked at the post exchange restaurant, I believe on Fort

24

Dix*
I would submit --

25

1

Q

She was a

A

She was the sister of a soldier and, was

fisfcer —*

visiting the Walson Army Hospital with her brother on the day

4

she was kidnapped and raped.
/

5

In the military court he received a sentence of

6

death, forfeiture of all pay and allowances and reduction to tha

7

lowest enlisted grade»

8

Board of Review, which is now the Court ©f Military Review and

9

it ~ the sentence was reduced to confinement at hard labor for

10

30 years and a dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of all pay

11

and allowances.

12

Q

It want to what was at that time the

What if he had been in uniform at the time.
/

13
14

Would that have mad© any difference in the case?
A

I don't think it would either.

That factor

15

wouldn't make any difference at all, Your Honor, because I

16

think in the 0BCallahan case this Court, in effect, looking at

17

several factors, what we really have to do is arrive at a

18

definition of service connection, I think.

!9

I think this Court looked at several factors in

20

O"Callahan, one of those being the factor that the courts are,

21

of necessity, and validly so, probably, instruments of dis»

22

cipline, as well as justice.

23
24
25

Secondly, the existence of specialized military
courts depends upon the special needs of the military.
Thirdly, I think the Court found that the jurisdiction
6

i

of military courts, in light of these considerations and in

2

light of history, must be limited to the least possible power

3

adequate to the end proposed, the end proposed being the main­

4

tenance of military discipline in the Armed Forces.

5
6

Q

Isn't that private?

7
8

How about security of the military feas^f?.'

A

I think the military has an interest in the

security of the military base, certainly,

9

Q

Is there any other power to establish or

W

enforce or maintain security on ‘the has#, other than the

ii

military?

n
13

A

I don5fc know. Your Honor.

I think the

military has an.interest —

u

Q

Civilian police can't function there —

15

A

Pardon me?

10

Q

Civilian police from the nearby state's

17
18
19

government can't function there, can they?
A

I doubt if they can unless- th,ey are asked

to function on that post.

But, let me point out'I think the

29

interest — I am not contesting the fact that the military

21

does have an interest in maintaining law and order on the post.

22

I'm not contesting that a military commander hasthe authority

23

and responsibility as the Respondent points out, to maintain

24

law and order on a military installation.

25

I do contest that these interests lead to the

1

1

conclusion that the military must be able to try and punish

a

the serviceman who commits a crime on a military installation

3

which leads to disorder or lawlessness on the military insfcadla

4

tion.

5

that they have this interest»

1 don51 think that that conclusion follows' the reasoning

6

I think what the Court was after in 03Callahan was

7

not simply an interest of the military or a military tie*b ut

8

a necessity on the part of the military to have jurisdiction

8

ever this crime if the maintenance of ^military discipline is

10

to be preserved.

n

tion as opposed to civilian courts exercising jurisdiction.

•12

The necessity that they exercise jurisdic-

The reason 1 say that 1 don8t believe the conclusion

13

that they must exercise jurisdiction follows from the state­

14

ments that they have an interest in maintaining law and order

15

on a military reservation-, is simply that I think the civilian

16

courtst exercising their jurisdiction will adequately s&rv® the

17

interests of the military in that situation.

18

The man who commits the' crime on the post* a service'

19

man* is not going to go unpunished* he is simply going to be

30

punished by civilian authorities rather than the military
»

21

authorities.

22

side of the scope of the least possible power adequate to the

23

end proposed.

24
25

I think that any other conclusion takes it out­

I might add that I think the same reasoning applies
to -the factor of military dependency.
8

X might also point out

!

that the Court of Military Appeals basically agrees with that

2

proposition that they have found the military dependency and

3

1 will admit it is military dependency by itself, does not

4

give the requisite service' connection to the crime»

5

Q

Let me try t© test your

6

your concept of interest»

7

here was on sentry duty that night»

8

then engaged in all this activity.

9

A

the scope of

Suppose he was on — Petitioner
He abandoned his past and

Yes, I think there would be military juris­

?0

diction involved there, Your Honors because I think -there is a

11

military crime ©f abandoning your post while on duty or some­

ia

thing of that order ~

13

Q

At that time obviously that would be subject

14

to military jurisdiction.

15

we are dealing with here.

16

A

Okay.

I'm talking about the crimes that

I am sorry.

I don't think -- let me

n

back up a minute — I think the military exercising its juris­

18

diction over that military crime adequately serves the mili­

19

tary's interest.

20

to exercise jurisdiction over the crimes of rapes committed

2!

while this man was -- after this man left his duty position.

I don't think that that gives them the right

22

Doss that answer your question?

23

1 also feel that the use ©f military installation

24

boundaries can lead to some very unusual and illogical con­

25

clusions if it is used by itself without any analysis of the

9

1

nature of the crime involved and the interests of the military

2

in exercising jurisdiction over that crime»

3

of Military Appeals' decisions adequately point this out»

4

I think the Court

Now* Respondent seeks to limit jurisdiction over

5

crimes committed on a military reservation to those crimes

6

which affect the security of persons and property on a military

7

reservation»

8

alters the illogical results that will be arrived at through

9

the use only of the military installation boundary as the

10

I don't -think that this restriction-’ in any "way

jurisdictional line»

11

1 don't think this Court in O'Callahan anticipated

12

that either, because I think they placed great emphasis on

13

an analysis of the crime itself and its effect on the interests

14

of the military organisation»

15

If I —

16

Q

What was the status of tills man — well there

1?

are two offenses -•* my question is whether he was on what we

18

used t© call "in the Navyff "liberty.”

I guess that they have

A

21

Q

22

A

He was on an evening pass.
Pass»

Was he on that?

He was on evening pass? according to the

23

record he was on evening pass at the time all four crimes were

24

committed.

25

Q

Both kidnappings and.both rapes?
10

A

i

Yes, Your Honor.

And out of uniform.

X

don’t feel that these are of any importance anyway —

2

Q

3

Welly wouldn't you agree that if he had

4

committed this offense while he was on duty with respect to

5

— on guard duty or something, that he might be? or working in

0

an office as a clerk-typist?
A

7

Again X feel that that would create a

military interest in a jurisdiction —

Q

— to the fact he was off duty* don't you?

A

Not with respect to the crime of rape and

14

it would foe a military offense if 'they were both on duty at the

IS

time.

Did X misunderstand you?
A

16

No, you did not.

There is a military crime

17

involved, but I don’t believe the military crime, the crime

18

the military had jurisdiction over would be a crime of rape and

It depends upon the particular camp

involved.

21

Sorae, as I understand the situation, some military installa­

prior to the state's existence.

This is an Amy camp inthe State of Hew Jersey,

I’m not sure — to

21

Q

22

Well, isn’t the whole point it does have

jurisdiction over that land?

23

A

My whole point is that the ~ either a state

or the Federal Government, a civilian jurisdiction has

jurisdiction, not the

3

Q

Do you recognize the. difference between the

C&jp Oix in Mew Jersey and the hotel in Honolulu?

4

A

Yes* I think there is a difference,

5

Q

A whole 'lot of difference,

6

A

I think there is a difference. I do not think

7

there is a distinction within the context of the reasoning in­

8

volved in the 0sCallahan decisiont however.

9

I do not think that the fact that that crime was

10

committed on a military installation increases trie interests

11

of the military in trying and punishing that man.

12

does increase their interest to the extent that there is a

13

police interest involved there? but that police interest is

U

©rate^saately met by the apprehension of that person and turning

You seem to put quite a bit on when you

Bay* which I think is the Naval Base.

10

That may be a situation

closely

11
12

-

Q

Who has jurisdiction there?

A

That may be a situation closely related to

13

the situation of the military base located in Germany and it

14

may be a particular military person maintaining jurisdiction in

15

order to exercise immediate disciplinary control which would

16

attach in that situation and bring the case within the concept

17

of the last possible power.

18
19
20
21

Q

What was your answer on Germany?

We turn

him over to the German authorities?
A

No.

My answer was that 1 think military

jurisdiction would attach because- of the fact that in assy event
