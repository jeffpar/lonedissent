ARGUMENT OF PETER L. STRAUSS, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OP THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR

MR. STRAUSS:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice,

12

Secretary of Interior must ignore administrative actions which

became final almost forty years ago,

were based.

That court decided that in passing on certain appli­

In each of these cases the Secretary was prepared

4

to show that the assessment work was not being done up to the

very moment when he acted, and that the government has

as much as a private individual might have done.

18

19

sufficient to show that the claimants were maintaining their

20

claims as the statute requires.

In its opinion, at page 646,

Now,

To my knowledge,

respondents would probably examine the subse­

This Court clearly enough could do so.
Respondent9s view of the bill makes it into a good

creates an indefeasible possessory right in public land re­

If it did, we would have to ask for its over­

15

Krushnic were rather special, and the government really has no

16

complaint and indeed concedes that it may be considerably

17

fairer on the whole to have the Krushnic decision on the books.

18

What happened in that case was that individuals had

19

been working their land, continued to work their land, applied

20

for a patent and the Secretary decided on a very technical

21

basis that in one year, the year after which they continued

22

to work.'and which no one took any notice at the time, in one

23

year there had been a lapse on one of the pieces of land and

That was the only issue which was pre­

The courts below never had to reach these questions

claims were void.

very strongly from the fact that the 1S20 act's saving clause

I should like to talk very briefly

turning briefly to that historical background,

between 1915 and 1920 there developed a great interest in oil

running out of hydrocarbon energy, because of the great draft

10

of the war and because of the great draft upon our requirements

11

that was put by the development of the automobile and the use

12

of petroleum instead of coal in a number of industrial uses.
An oil shale industry had existed in the world since

13

the 17th Century.

them on appeal and confirmed his original instruction in a

The trial in the court below was solely on the

question of laches, because we introduce voluminous evidence,

Now, I come, sir, to & question on maintenance, to

We think the background of that is not uncomplicated

24

Q

This came in in the 1920 Act, did it?

25

A

That is correct, sir.
6C

Q

Yes.
i

A

The background of it is this, briefly:

You

recall, that the mining laws that. I have described in which
there was a direct grant of a claim went back primarily to
what is called the so-called hard rock minerals.

They came

out of the gold rush to California and hard rock minerals,
unlike petroleum and natural gas, are found,, characteristics,
either in lodes, in which you have a vein, which under our law,
as you know, you can follow wherever the gold goes,

or they

are placer claims like those out in the open where you might
find gold in a riverbed.
In the 90th Congress, the last session,

the question

came up as to which one of these categories oil and gas fitted
in.

The Interior said first it is patented as a placer.

the Interior Secretary said he didn’t think it was.

Then

Then he

finally said he thought oil and gas was and finally Congress
affirmed that by saying that oil and gas was patentable as a
placer.
Then a question arose, because in 1909 oil and gas
was going to be withdrawn from further location, and Interior,
in connection with various withdrawals that it had made,

had

decided that if a man was looking for oil or gas and was
drilling and hadn't hit it but was still looking,

it was un­

fair to cut him off even though he hadn’t made a discovery.
So they established the administrative rule that when, in

and kept looking,

question arose in the Congress, because they said — the

Interior said what are we going to do about these different

kind of claims that aren't real claims because no discoveries

happened.

12

So they put in this provision that so long as the

13

oil or gas man, it was directed at him, maintained the claim

by going forward to seek discovery,

8 \ in assessment work.

Ha said that before 1920

That is true only as a general rule.

9

There were cases» and we cite them in our brief, where the

10

government needed land for a dam or for a fort or for some

11

other specific purpose, and in that case it went out and it

12

got interested in whether the land was being maintained again.

13

Q

Maintained in what sense?

'14

A

In the assessment work sense,

15
16

among others.

The case of E, C„ Kinney, which is -Q

I must confess,

I am a little lost.

I thought

17

the basic premise of your case was that a condition to retain­

18

ing a possessory interest was that you continued to do the

19

assessment work required by the statute.

20

A

No.

Am I wrong?

Our case is that a condition of maintain­

21

ing any claim is that you continue to do the assessment work

22

up to a point where the government may come in and relocate,

23

in effect, that in this kind of case, where the government

24

wishes land for specific use, whether it be a darn or a national

25

park or a national forest, or in order to lease it.
68

If it

1

comes along and it finds that here is a piece of land and the

2

people who have claims on this land aren't using it, aren't

3

maintaining it, aren't doing assessment work at this point, it

4

can post the land and take it back, and that is precisely

S

what was done in these cases»

6

Indeed, this is a case very much -- if these were

7

private individuals involved, I have every confidence that the

8

Colorado courts would say the government has taken over these

9

lands by adverse possession.

10

It staked them in 1932.

Mo one

else breathed on them until 1954.
. *v'

ti

It seems to me incredible that one could have a

12

state of law that said that these claims must be honored today.

13

There was some discussion of abandonment as a remedy for the

14

government.

15

difficulty with that remedy again is this sentence in Virginia-

16

Color ado, and before I get to it I would like to read some

17

sentences from some other Supreme Court opinions.

The difficulty with that remedy, the practical

!

18

In Onion Oil Company vs. Smith, Volume 249 of this

19

Court's report, the Court said the possessory right is lost

20

only by abandonment as by non-performance of the annual

21

assessment work.

22

In Donnelly vs. United States, in 223 U.S., the

23

Court said, of course, under the mining law a claim may be

24

abandoned by failure to do the required development work.

25

up to this point the government, if it could show that
69

To

i

assessment work was not being done, might have some kind of

2

remedy if it called it abandonment.

3

find a very different sentence.

4

government gained no right by the failure to do assessment

S

work.

6

abandonment, and that is a very pernicious sentence.

In Virginia-Colorad© we

That sentence says the

The failure to do assessment work is no evidence of

7

Q

It is just that sentence, isn't it?

8

h

It is principally that sentence in terms of the

9

effect on the government's continuing right.

I may say it is

SO

also, if I raay, in conclusion — there is also this other

11

matter,, that we do not believe that the Secretary back in 1935

12

exceeded his jurisdiction when he passed on these claims, even

13

if they were erroneous.

14

from1 your opinions in United States vs. San Francisco and

15

United States' vs, California, that any error the Secretary may

16

have made in interpreting this Court's holding does not mean

n

that on the basis of that error the government must give up

18

its claim to these three million acres of land.

19
20

Q

We are confident, Mr. Justice Black,

1 think it is clcs® to that argument, but when

I look at Ickes vs. Development Corporation —

21

h

22

Q

Right.
Chief Justice Hughes said there was author­

23

ity in the Secretary of Interior toy appropriate proceedings

24

to determine that a claim was invalid for lack of discovery

2,5

for fraud or other defects or that it was subject to cancellation
70

1

by reason of abandonment.

2

your only objection to this case — 1 may be wrong -- would be

3

that the government has all the remedies it would have,

4

title has not passed from it*

5

the eternal exclusion of the government, but that the govern­

Q

Except that two sentences before that* the in­

Well, I think that was proved, as I explained

before in the circumstances of that case.

Isn't that connected with the later sentence,

plaintiff had lost no rights for failure to do the annual

assessment work?

9

A

If 1 may review for a moment the circumstances

10

of that case, the court had decided in Wilbur vs. Krushnie in

n

1930, the Virginia-Colorado Company had been doing assessment

12

work up to that very year.

13

cided, there may have come to he a belief, well, it is no

14

longer necessary to do this work.

15

it was only fifteen months and not fifty years, the work

10

stopped.

When Wilbur vs. Krushnie was de­

So for fifteen months, and

At the end of the fifteen months, the Secretary

18

came in.

The claimant, in that case, unlike most of the claim­

19

ants here, responded and they said no, we are all sat to go

20

back on the land and we are ready to resume the assessment work

21

We are going to do it.

22

as being the actual state of affairs in that circumstances we

23

would agree that there was no ground for forfeiture.

And that was stipulated and agreed to

ARGUMENT OF FOWLER HAMILTON* ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS--REBUTTAL
MR. HAMILTON:

7

In connection with maintenance* I

8

haves given you our view of the genesis of the phrase "to

3

maintain."

10

We think that when Chief Justice Hughes was dis­

cussing in the latter paragraph, in which he said a claim
could be maintained by doing assessment work, he was answering,

\2

in effect, a rhetorical question that: had been put to him in

13

the course of the argument in the brief, so that we say as a

14

matter of definition a claim can be maintained and is against

15

other people, and the locators by doing assessment work.

16

can be maintained against the government by not abandoning it.

17

It can be maintained against the government, in other words,

18

by doing all of those things that are necessary to qualify you

19

for a patent.
