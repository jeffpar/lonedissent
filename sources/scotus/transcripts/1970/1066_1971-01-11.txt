Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Courts
This case was previously before Your Honors on
December 7th, at which time the parties engaged in extensive
oral argument on Petitioner's application for stay to prevent
the construction of the large six-lana interstate highway
through Overton Park in Memphis, Tennessee.
After hearing, the Court granted the stay, gram ted
certiorari and set the case for argument on the merits today.
As Your Honors will recall, this case arises under
a Federal statute generally referred t© as Section 4(f) of the
Department ©f Transportation Act, which provides that the
Secretary!’ ©f Transportation shall not approve a highway project
which affects a public park such as Overton Park, unless there
\

23
24
25

are no feasible and prudent alternative routes or unless the
design includes all possible planning to minimise harm.
As we pointed out in the argument on December 7feh,
3

1

there are alternative routes than that through the park.

There?

2

are alternative designs which would minimise harm to the park;

3

designs that may be possible in this case.

.{

4

We have alleged and supported that the proper

5

determinations which are required by Section 4(f) of the

6

Department ©f Transportation Act were not made, and indeed

7

even if they were mad©, they were infirm or legally invalid.

a
9

Since this Court "granted certiorari there have been
two important developments in this case and thereafter, the

10

Solicitor General, on behalf of the Secretary, filed a motion

fi

to remand in which he conceded that the courts below had erred

'12

in granting and affirming summary judgment on the basis of

13

affidavits which were characterised documents on which the

14

determinations, he said, had been mad®.
We certainly agree that the summary judgment was

15
16

wrong, but we are opposed to an immediate remand because of the

17

other concurrent issues which we believe should be decided in

18

this case.
The second important development which has occurred

19

20

since we ware here before, occurred approximately ten minutes

21

ag©»

22

©£ paper which purport t© be affidavits which 1 understand ha

At that time the Solicitor General handed me two pieces

23

is attempting t© file in this case at, this time, on® of which

24

says it is an affidavit of Alan S. Boyd, in which he says, as

25

a matter ©£ fact, that he did make a determination which we

4

1

have alleged he did not make and which we have offered to prove

2

hedid not make.
The second piece of paper which he has filed pur­

3
4

ports to be an. affidavit of John VoXpe that he mad© certain

3

determinations,

validity of a warrantless search and as I recall that case in

ii

the course of oral argument the attorney for the state said

12

for the first time in the proceedings that in fact the search

13

in that case had not been without a warrant? he had found the

14

warrant after the decision below,, and I believe he attempted to

15

file the warrant in this Court,
As I recall the ©pinion in that case the Court said/

16

17

"It's to© late? you make your rsoord in the trial court and

18

afc that point you consider that's where these facts are tried

The second issue which remains in this case# aside

14

from the question of whether there was adequate compliance to

Section 4(f) by the Secretary's failure to render a written

document at th® time the decisions were made# the second issue

17

which remains is whether the court below was proper in holding

25

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

If these two statements

8
I

i

had been part of the original record, would you think that you

2

could cross-examine the former Secretary and the present

3

Secretary on how they reached their conclusions and what —

4

MR» VARDAMhM:

Well, I think that would present a

3

much mors difficult issue, Your Honor, but I think we should

S

be able to interrogate them, particularly if they are not

7

operating on the basis of a temporaneous document — in other

0

words, these are not documents that were written at the time

9

that the decision was made; 'these ©re, what r would characteriz

10

litigation affidavits. These were obviously prepared with the

11

help ©f a lawyer with the scope of the lav/suit firmly in mind

12

and filed in the court,

13

Now, I think it would not be inappropriate in cir-

14

cumstances of that nature to ask him whether in fact he made

IS

the decisions and if so, what materials h© had before him,

16

don’t think it would be proper ~ it may not be proper to says

17

“Did you read every page," as 1 tried to do in. Morgan, or did

you consider this factor on page 1 arid that factor on page 2,

19

20

decisions must be able to ascertain what decisions were made

and what the basis, that is what the documents before the per­

22

son would have been in order that they can seek a review;

23

in order that they can seek a review of what he did on the

But, in the general case, in the usual case, I would

suggest that we would not cross-examine in those circumstances.

will dispute this.

not so concerned about cross-

And it®s interesting that t lie reason it hasn61 been presented

heretofore is because former highway administrator Bri&weil

said he didn81 think it was proper when I talked to him to

Do you think he's the appropriate person to

make that decision?

No, 2 don't* but I'm simply explaining why we

11

don!t have an affidavit of the same nature that they did here

12

today.

13
H

Q

Are these statements here — d© -they show

when the decision was made if a decision was made?

15

A

Well, the certificate of Alan Boyd says that

16

in April of 1968 h© made a decision that there was no feasible

'17

and prudent alternative t© a highway generally along the bus

18

route —

19
20

Q

That was three years ago.

Was there any­

thing else shown except this evidence?

Wot in this affidavit.

Q

Was there any record that you claim will

23

shew that they did have an investigation and did make a find­

24

ing &p, to what route was feasible?

25

A

Well, there are-varied, allegations in the

21

that the only standard of review was the arbitrary and

22

capricious standard, but the Administrative Procedure Act im­

poses that as >the minimum constitutional requirement, so the

legislative history said.

25

The Court of Appeals said,

forward and even if the finding was not arbitrary and

13

I will refer to toe facts of the case to which Mr. Vardanian has

14

not made much reference this morning.

15

The park which is involved here, Overton Park in

16

Memphis, is about eight-tenths of a mile across.

17

in the record it says 4800 feet; another place it seems to

18

How I turn t© the question of findings*

6

statute does not require findings ©r a trial type hearing by

duct a trial-type hearing®
How, following a suggestion which was made in the

12

previous oral argument in this case, we have obtained from

13

both Secretaries involved, certificates stating their findings®

14

How, these are referred t© by Mr® Vardanian, understandably, as

15

affidavits but they are not so denominated themselves; they

16

are certificates made by high government officers with respect

17

to actions which they took and they do, we

18

submit, serve to

clarify any ambiguity which may lie in the record by reason

19

of the fact that they did not make formal findings which I

20

again submit the statute does not require them to do®

21

We recognise that the presentation of these

22

documents is unusual*

We submit them for what effect -they can

23

properly be given*

4

changed it and the result is that we have withdrawn the printed

6

originalof the certificates to the Clerk and have provided

Q

Mr. Solicitor General*, may 1 ask you* in view

©f your statement that no formal findings are required.

What

10

kind would you say would be required t© take car© of the pre­

11

cautionary actions which the Congress has prescribed?

h

12

Yes* Mr. Justice.

I think that it should

13

appear in some appropriate way and 1 hope that these certifi­

14

cates ara ap shall 1 say*, a last resort* appropriately* that

15

the Secretaries did* in fact* recognize and take into account

18

and undertake t© operate under the statutory requirements

17

clearly and validly made foy Congress.

18

without these formal certificates from ‘the Secretary there is

19

sufficient in the record t© show that they did proceed on that

20

basis.

21

We think 'that even

But what the statute says is s that the Secretary can­

not approve any program or project involving parklands unless*

23

ones there is a® feasible and prudent alternative for the us®

24

©f such land and twos such possible findings to minimize harm

25

t® such park resulting from such use.
26

It dees not even say

1

63«Bless the Secretary finds that there is no such alternative,"

2

and I suspect that that is because Congress deliberately

wanted to avoid the Secretary having to hold a hearing and take

A

Yes, Mr» Justice, the Department is up­

io

of si© reason why that should be applied retroactively to pro­

11

ceedings which war® already far along by the time that was

12

adopted and I don’t read the court case on which the

13

Petitioners rely as leading to any such conclusion.

14

The fact ©f the matter —

15

Q

Do you think there is —

16

A

It is clear here that both Secretaries

17

understood the requirements of the statute and they have now

18

both certified that they did understand it and that they com­

19

plied with it.

20

This Court has often held that formal findings

21

should not be insisted on when they are not legislatively

22

commended.

23

The standard ©f review should be whether the action

24

©f the Secretary was arbitrary and capricious.

25

the Petitioners are far from having sustained their burden ©f

We think that

28
I

1

pgQOi that there was such arbitrary and capricious action here.

2

We think that this record contains maple material

3

to show that both Secretaries acted carefully, thoughtfully,

4

deliberately and with full awareness of 'their obligation under

5

the statute9 but it was their decision and they knew it.

6

task is one ©f great responsibility and they should be upheld.

7

The

The Administrative Procedure Act does not apply to

8

this because it's a grant-making matter which is expressly ex­

9

cluded from the Act.

10

But if it doss apply it would lead to the

same results.

11

Q

Could I ask you a question?

12

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

13

Q

Mr. Solicitor —

My recollection is that intermediate t© the

14

earlier argument on the stay and today’s argument the Govern­

15

ment made a suggestion that this case should be remanded —

16

A

17

Q

18

A

Yes„ Mr. Justice, I am just turning to 'that.
Oh, I’m sorry.
If -the Court feels that -the question'''#£

19

arbitrary and capricious action cannot be determined on this

20

record, and we felt there was some indication of that in the

21

previous argument, then we rely on our motion to remand for the

22

purpose ©£ allowing the admission of the administrative record

23

in the District Court.

24

We do not think that ‘there should be a remand for

25

a full trial unless the District Court finds after examining
29

I

the administrative record that it. cannot decide the issue of

2

arbitrary and capricious action without a further trial.

3

file the motion of remand not for the purpose of conceding

4

error here* as Mr. Vardaman says, but for the purpose ©f narrow

5

irag the scope of any remand and for the purpose of negativing

6

any suggestion that there should not b© such a limited remand

7

because we have not asked for such a limitation.

a
9

We

Now, I see that my time has virtually expired.

I

will have t© summarise my remaining point..
The third one I wanted to make was that a remand

10

11

her© would, it seems to me, be a triumph of formalism.

With

12

the benefit ©£ hindsight, this record is not all that 1 might

13

like to have.

14

formal findings at the time they made their determinations,

IS

though they have made such findings now.

It would be nicer if -the Secretaries had made

16

It would be better if we didn’t have to piece out

17

the essence of their determinations from other actions which

13

they took like press releases and resolutions and letters and

19

affidavits and it is for this reason that w® move for the

20

introduction ©f the remand for the introduction of the admiral-»

21

strative record.
But this is not really an exercise in futility.

22
23

Would It not be a triumph ©£ formalism over substance, or in

24

Mr. Justice Frankfurter's well-known wordss “A case of marching

25

the Mil

men up -the hill and -then marching them down again."

30

1

The remand for farther proceedings, would , I think ,

2

be a kind of mechanical jurisprudence more fitting for a

3

barren park (?) than for the final third of the 24 th Century.

10

11

that there is ample and adequate in the record now to make it

12

plain that if this is remanded a great deal of

13

15

16

17

motion will be

That assumes there will be a record which

does not now appear.
A

18

Mr. Justice, we think there isn’t — if the

19

test of review is whether the Secretary acted in an arbitrary

20

and capricious manner, which we think.is the test, we think it

21

is apparent from this record that neither Secretary acted in an

22

arbitrary ©r capricious manner, ignoring the requirements of fchs

23

statute.

24
25

If that does not adequately appear then we think
the case should be remanded so that the administrative record

31

I

can b© seen by the District Court and that question determined

2

on the administrative record.

3

What we think should not be done here iss anything

4

which requires a trial-type hearing before the Secretary or

5

anything which leads to what amounts to a trial de novo before

6

the District Court and a decision ©f this question in effect

7

by the District Court rather than by the Secretary.

8

Because, that is my final points the fundamental
v

9

question here, one of the- separation of powers of the proper

10

allocation ©f function to courts, legislatures and the execu­

11

tive branch, and the important and complex task ©f carrying on

12

government, two things are clears one is -that Congress has

13

legislated certain specific requirements with respect t© the

14

us© ©f parklands and the other is that it has allocated the

IS

administration of that provision to the executive branch,

16
17

specifically to the Secretary ©f Transportation.
This does not mean that there is no role for the

18

courts, for the Secretary should be held in check if he ignores

19

the. legislative requirements.

20

role ©f the courts is a narrow and limited one and it is impor­

21

tant, I submit, both for the administration ©f the government

22

and for the court that the limited nature ©£ that role be

23

recognised and observed.

24

governmental decisions decided by courts, ©r even to have a

25

In recent years more and more governmental decisions

Secretary Boyd approved the rou

'’approved® is the key word in the statute.

7

concerning the approval? there is no dispute concerning the

final approval of the route design in November of 1969, since

whether or not findings as such were'acquired miei? the park

13

as cited in our brief, the colloquy that occurred between Mr.

the issues were and what he was contending.

General does that this is a discretionary statute?that Congress

21

gave th© Secretary of Transportation the discretion t© make

22

this decision and that the findings as such are not required by

Now# the question of review# as I stated earlier#

of 'the law that when you challenge the actions of an administra­

25

is what Mr. Vardaman ultimately wants.

They didn't say —» as a matter of fact,they didn't

even make a eonclusory allegation that Secretary Volpe was

arbitrary and capricious.

They just said he didn't make any

4

findings.

5

that's the end of that, issue.

6

he need not make, that again is dispositive ©f the issue.

7

Now, if this Court holds that findings he must make
If the Court holds that findings

Now, it’s not that he 9s precluded from judicial

8

review or that this Court is precluded from reviewing the case,

o

it1s because he did not allege facts that warrant judicial

10

review beyond what he has here today.

11

Secretary Volpe laid this rout® out because he had a relative

12
13

near by who would profit from the sale of his land or the
/
enhancement ©f its value or that he deliberately refused to

14

consider evidence or that he deliberately chose engineers to

13

advise him who he knew were not properly trained, that may be

16

the basis for a review beyond the scope that we have here on

the question of summary "judgment.

If he had said that

Now, going from that -there are many eases that have |

22

been b©for© this Court and tfa© lower Federal Courts to the

23

effect that with those allegations you can g© forward and you

can question the Secretary.

Where did he fall short of that?

What did he allege?

that these various routes had been approved? the designs had

10

In conclusion I

11

again ask the Court to, before determining the standard of

12

judicial review, the question of whether the Secretary ©r

13

Federal Administrator BridwelX should have been deposed? to

14

carefully examine the issues to determine what the issues are.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY JOHN W. VARDAMAN, ESQ.

21

22

Thank you, Mr. Hanover.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. VAKDAMAN:

Mr. Chief Justices

Respondents in

23

this case traditionally start each argument with the statement

24

that this highway will run along a bus route through the park.

25

And the implication being it will have pract!©ally no affect ©n
38

1

this park.

2

Well; this bus route displayed her© is a narrow

3

facility some 25 feet wide in which buses run through about

4

once an hour? in fact it's so narrow that the trees from the

5

wooded part ©f the park hang over the bus route freely crossed

6

by pedestrians.

7

Q

Will it be for passengers only?

8

A

The bus route is only used for about one bus

9

an houri no cars? no other factors.
Q

10
'31

Is the road to beused

forpassengers

only

or for passengers and freight?

12

A

Oh; for commercial

and passengervehicles»

13

Q

Freight?

14

A

Freight? trucks.

IS

The statement which they claim is unwarranted*' the

16

statement which says there won't be much of a wooded area left

17

in the park, that's not a statement we mad©? that's a statement

18

that an official of the Dapartmentof Interior made* a depart-»

saent which the Secretary is sfeatute^bound t© consult with in

20

projects of this nature.

22

any other evidence? they simply say it can't be right.

It is a document fully a part of the

A

1 think what the official had in mind* not

3

that the major part of the woodland would foe taken , -there would

4

foe a 450-foot right-of-way through that area, but what he

5

meant was not only the take of 450 feet, font you really destroy

6

the rest of the park, because immediately you don't have a

7

woodlands park immediately adjacent to the highway if you've

8

got a six-lane interstate highway going*

9

the sound, the general pollution associated with highways

You have the sight,

which spreads further than the right-of-way*

How wid© would you say it is? '

A

Well, there is a very ~ it's not clear, but

I think that -Q

That9s one of the points they have made alsop

hat -they didn’t take very much»

3

■ The second, point which they raise is that the

4

right-of-way for this route was acquired long — it was

3

acquired after the decisions were made»

6

ment of Transportation authorised the acquisition for the

7

right-of-way of this project before they ever made any effort to

8

comply with this statute.

9

In fact; the Depart­

Even if we assume what the Solicitor General says

10

is correct; and even if we assume what they state in their

11

certificates are right; tha Department of Transportation told

12

the state to go ahead and acquire the land for this project in

13

May ©f 1967, a month after the statute was effective, and 11

14

months before any effort was mad© to comply with it*

15

submit that right-of-way acquired under that autnorination was

16

acquired illegally and should not prejudice the Petitioners5

17

position —
Q

IS

And I

Could you indicate briefly what it is

19

exactly that you expect t© be able t© show if this cas© is

20

remanded?

21

A

I would be able to show, "four Honor, that

22

in say — my evidence would show that the officials of the

23

Department of Transportation left this decision solely to the

24

City Council ©f Memphis.

other is the Department of Transportation that these alterna*»

3

tives •— whether these alternatives were prudent and feasible»

4

They attempted to delegate to the City Council and one® the

s

City Council made up its mind they simply rubber-stamped that

6

and approved the highway without ever making its own independen

7

judgment as to whether there were feasible and prudent alter-

8

natives„

j

Q

9
10

Are you going to do that without cross-

examining Mr» Boyd and Mr. Volp©?
A

II

WellB that's what Mr. Bridwell would testify

12

to.

I think it's also supported by the evidence ©f his

13

testimony before the Congress, which is an exhibit in this

14

case.

But, that's what Secretary Bridwell will testify to.

•

15

1 think that in footnote 25 of the Solicitor

16

General's brief you can see that the statute imposes an

17

obligation on the Secretary of Transportation t© make an in­

18

dependent determination and we will show that determination was

19

never made her®.

20

Q

Apart from the technical question of —

21

about those certificates, you are in effect saying that these

22

certificates should not be taken at face value?

23
24
25

A

That's correct, Your Honor, because we have

evidence which would dispute it.
Q

1 gather you claim they not only did not
42

j

'3

make the so-called formal findings* but they made no findings

2

at all?
A

3

4

That's correct? didn't even make a minimal

determination.
Further* with respect to the design* we would show

5
6

that the designs which they reject as impossible* are in fact*

7

designs which are clearly possible.

8

designs that ara used throughout the interstate highway system

9

and ar® clearly possible here.

They are the types of

And I don't know on what

30

basis they could possibly say that they were impossib!©* in

i. i

terms of the statute* but we will prove that they certainly

12

were possible.
Q

33

In fact -Mr. Vardaman* you don't question that these

34

are the signatures of Secretary Volpe and Secretary Boyd? do

Q

to contradict them.

I merely say I think that we have evidence

Furthermore* there is reference made

to the legis»

Well, in a developing field, do you suggest

A

9
10

Those are materials that were created j

1 suggest that it is not relevant, Your

Honor, because,! think, as we point out in our brief, that

11

those statements were made generally, by people who opposed

12

this statute in the beginning? who tried to amend_it, to

13

weaken the statute? in fact the Secretary of Transportation

14

opposed any amendment.

So, there were, in effect, efforts to cut down the

force of the statute on the Floor of the Congress.

Finally, I would say, Your Honors, that this case is;

not only important to my clients, the Petitioners in this case,

but the people of Memphis.
