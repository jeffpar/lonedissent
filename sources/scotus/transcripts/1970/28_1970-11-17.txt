ORAL ARGUMENT BY MICHAEL B, PADNQS, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

7
8

Mr. Padnoa, you may

proceed whenever you are ready . .
MR. PADNQS s

9

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

10

the Court:

The Appellants in this case, Your Honors, presented

11

to the Court over a year ago what we thought was a narrow

12

question of due process, involving the right to a hearing.

13

When we presented the case fe© you last time we

14

argued, on the basis of the Sniadach ease that the deprivation

15

of the property, the rental- property of our clients was uncon­

16

stitutional.

17

that argument, this Court has given further encouragement to

18

our clients and to us on the same issue, with the case of

IS

Goldberg v. Kelly, which is again a hearing case involving due

20

process.
Our position is very simple, that really we don't

21
22

23
24
25

Since the Sniadach ease and since we last made

ask the Court to go any further than the Court went in those
cases.

Indeed, we take the position that the case before you

is much easier to deal with than the cases you dealt with, —
the two cases you dealt with there.
2

Q

1

Hr, Padnos, I hesitate to bring the question

2

up, but I think there is a question of mootness in this case;

3

certainly the suggestion of mootness has been filed in this

4

case prior to argument and my recollection is that the Court
deferred' consideration of that motion t© reargument on the

5

6

merits and 1 would expect that you will be dealing with that?,

1

will you, before the
A

3

I’d be happy to begin with that, sin it might

be easier, Your Honor.

9

The Appellees have suggested to you that there is a

10

11

possibility of mootness and they have raised two pointss first

12

of all,, they point, out that they believe that our clients may

13

have, moved out and indeed, that's right? our clients have moved

out * •

14

And secondly, they present the existence of a new-

15

statute enacted in Georgia earlier this year.

16

As we indicated

in our response to the question, that I think there are several

17

reasons why -this case is not moot.

18

First of all, the fact w®@ that as to our clients,

19

the specific clients in this case; Mrs. SAnks and Mrs. Morman,(?

20

even though they have moved out they are still subject-to double

21

rent provisions of 61305.

22

So there is no way that this Court

if this Court should hold, this case- moot, we would not be

23

within the Brockington case and Hall v. Dios

m

decided last year.

.25

3
I

(?) that this Court

A

i

In ©ne of those cases the Court said that it was

2

impossible to grant the relief that the plaintiffs sought.,

3

That was in Brookington (?) 1 believe, where there was a man

4

running for Congress and in ‘the other, case; Harvey v. DiosC?)

5

the Court'just talked about the 1968 election and said, "That’s

6

history? it3a all over with."

7

Well, it isn’t history what9s happening to Ms,

8

Sankso

Mrs. Sanks, as a matter of the same proceeding which is

9

before you right now, would be held, if the landlord does not

10

more than walk into court in the same judicial proceeding and

n

ask for double, damages, will be held liable for double damages

12

for the total amount of rent that he claims to b® due.

13

So, Mrs. Sanks is —

U

fh

15

Well, iim,rt~thafc entirely clear on the new

Georgia legislation?

16

A .

M

0

Yes,sir.
Because in the chronological history of this

18

case, as I recollect it, the intermediate appellate court agreed

19

with you, did they not? and then it went up to the Supreme

20

Court of Georgia and was remanded so that you’ve never had a

21

hearing

22

A•

No? we *—

23

Q

And up until the Supreme Court, the courts

M
25

were deciding in your favor? isn’t that correct?
A

Well, sir, we have been in three courts.

4

We

1

began in the Civil Court of Pulton County where there was a

2

judicial opinion and that was in favor of our clients.

3

went directly to the Georgia Supreme Court,

4

decision and now we3re here.

It. then

That was an adverse

5

0

It really wasn't a final judgment; was it?

6

A

K©t sir; it wasn't at all»

7

Q

8

Indeed —

V

And ‘that may be another thing -- fact that we

ought to consider.

©

A

Well, Is11 be happy to address myself to that.

10

Q

A remand to the ferial court;, wasn't it?

II

A

Well, sir, under Georgia procedure when a

12

trial judge feels that the guest-ion is of such importance: that it

13

-- that the rest of the case canet continue until a decision is

14

had on the earlier issue, he may put the case forward to appeal

15

right at that moment, and that's what happened-in this case.
And, in Judge Williams6 opinion, which you will

16
17

find in the Appendix, Judge Williams specifically found that the

18

matter was of such importance that immediate appeal should be'

19

had.

20

So, we went as far as the procedures of that court

21

would permit us to go and we couldn't file the bond and that's

22

why we couldn't go any further in the case.

23
24
as

Q

The question you are presenting to us has been

finally decided by the Georgia Supreme Court?
A

By the Georgia Supreme Court»

5

1i
2 i

4
3

Q

You mean that question isn’t open in the trial

:ourt any more? ia it?
A

No, that question is not open — all of the

ssues involving the personal bond have been closed»
The substantive issues have not been litigated,

6

amely; Mrs. Merman5s defense to eviction and Mrs. Sank8®

7

efense, but the issues of -the bond have now been — w® have

3

one as far as we can go on those.

8

Q

And that8 s the only Federal question?

10

A

That8® theonly Federal question; yes, sir.

11

<£ course, if the case were to continua there might be Federal

12

uestions arising out of the substantive matters and indeed, 2

13

uspecfc there might.

14

Q

But that9s apparently not going to happen.

My preliminary question was that since this was

15

emanded for hearing is it entirely clear as a matter of Georgia

16

hate Law that under this Act that became effective on July 1st

17

>£ this year, that there ~ that any constitutional infirmities

18

ould attend any new proceedings in this case?

19
20

A

Well, sir, I might-have misunderstood you, but

think that the problem is that the new statute became effective!
/

21

.s of July 1st and lire ire asserting no claims and indeed, that

22

tabufee, we contend,and I think the Court may really have to find]
that, was utterly irrelevant to these proceedings.

The di@~

ossession warrant that we’re dealing with was taken out prior
to July 1, 1970.

It was under the old- act, and our contention

6

1

is that although there is now a new act, and I9m happy to

2

admit to the Court,, as is perfectly obvious» that there are

3

not anywhere near as many people going to be affected by the

4

act which we are talking about today than would be affected by

5

the new act.

6

group of people» but we are “** under the old act., V ' •

7

And so we are talking about a relatively small

Now» 1 certainly submit to the Court and 1 think 1

8

am being» I8m accurate in it» it is particularly clear that our

9

.clients and potentially other clients» indeed» the clients in

10

the two cases that are now pending before the Federal District

It

Court in the Northern District of Georgia» at least those two

12

groups of people are potentially subject to double damages.

13

And in this piece of litigation I think that's

14

important; indeed» in the — of the argument last time I found

15

that I may really have misled the Court because I suggested

16

that a second lawsuit might have to be filed in order to

17

collect these damages.

18

I'm not sure actually -chat that isn't true.

19

be done is if you should hold this case moot» for example» or

20

if you should decide for the Appellee» all that needs to happen

21

in this case is that the landlord in both of these cases goes

22

into court and says» ”1 now want a judgment amounting to

23

double the amount of the rent that has been paid during the

24

period of this litigation. "

25

Q

I have done a little more research and
All that needs to

Well» does the new statute specifically

7

1

save the right to enter these under the old law?

2

A

No, sir; it's silent on the subject.

3

Q

Well, how do you know then that the Georgia

4

Court will not say that! “Now, since the landlords can no

5

longer have double damages, we will not give him double dam­

6

ages.

7

any more.M

8
9
10

That remedy just is not available in the Georgia courts

A

Well, because, sir, I would presume that the

remedy derives out of the action as it was filed and not out
of subsequent changes of law.

11

Q

Are you sure that’s true in cases of remedy

2

in procedure?

3

A

Mo, sir;

4

Q

As a matter of fact, isn't it contrary to

am not.

5

the general rule, that remedial matters are affected by sub­

6

sequent legislation?

17
in

A

It's a matter, Your Honor, that I am not

familiar with.
Q

Well, didn’t you file some answer to the

suggestion of mootness here?
A

Yes, sir.

Q

I thought you suggested that the new law was

specifically not applicable to the pending action.
A

Well, it certainly isn't applicable 'to pending

action insofar as that now, for example, there is no question
8

1

of having fco post: a bond any more.

2

Q

Well, does Georgia ~ do you know whether

3

Georgia has a general savings statute which saves rights and

4

remedies under repealed laws?

5

A

I do not.

6

Q

Do you have any limitations problems at all

1

with this case?

I'm sorry.

What is your statute of limitations, for -----

8

A

For civil actions in general it's two years.

§

Q

The double rent provision?

10

A

There is no statute of limitations as a part

11

of the eviction law, the dispossessory law.
1 take it that the Court is suggesting that, ob­

12

13

viously, that they — that a lower court might not grant the

14

double damages which the initial lawsuit permitted,

15

know how we can know that, in fact.

I don’t

IS

Q

Was your client living in the house?

17

A

Well, sir --

18

Q

How long since she left?

19

A

Mrs. Worm an moved out about a. month ago, but

20

she was there until that time-

21

Q

What about the -other ■ lady?

22

A

The other lady is rather hard to keep track

23

of.

She may have been out for some time.

24

she's been out. She doesn't have a telephone and doesn't res­

25

pond to our communications so I'm sot too sura about that.
9

I'm not sure hew lone

i

Q

Well, if the new statute is silent on th©

2

matter, on its applicability to the pending-action and if

3

Georgia has a general savings provision, saving rights and

4

remedies under prior laws, under repealed laws, why you have

S

one answer, but if it doesn't have one of those statutes then

6

you have, certainly the common-law rule which looks in the

7

other direction»

8
9
10

A

1 just didn’t look that ups and 1 guess I

should have, but X didn51»
As a general rule, though, in these eviction cases,

11

I can say that the courts have held that the fact, for example,

12

that the tenant moved out is not enough to free him of the

13

double damages provision and that's what happened her© and I

14

would suspect that the courts would bring that into play if

15

faced with the' question that you have raised? that is: the

16

real action that may have made this case moot is the fact that

17

the tenant moved out and that, th© courts have clearly said, is

m

not enough to prevent double damages.

19

Q

Let's assume that, for the moment, that there

20

was no possibility of the landlord getting double damages

21

against your client? let's just assume that.

22

A

Yes, sir.

23

Q

Even though you think it's contrary to fact.

24

21

If you assume that is the case moot?
A

Yes.

I think the case is moot in this sense:
10

1

let me just give you this reservation»

2

this sense, the very technical narrow sense that Mrs, Sanks

3

and Mrs* Mo man had nothing to stand to gain or lost nothing by

4

this litigation.

5

mootness, I think the case would he moot.

6

The case is moat in

In a narrow reading of the concept of the

In a broader reading of the concept of mootness, I

7

might point out, as we have in our brief, that you have the

8

Msltser case on the Clerk8s docket right now, which raises the

9

identical issue; you have Wise and Williams, which are the two

10
11

cases in the Northern District —
Q

Well, it seams to me that if you, since there

12

is some doubt the double damages matter, this might be in some

13

case, an appropriate case in which there really isn't a final

14

judgment for purposes of action in this Court, since our

15

jurisdiction would depend on the double damages matter.

16
17
18

A

Well, sir, in recovering from my surprise at

having this issue raised -Q

Well, the issue, you raised it in the — the

19

state raised the mootness matter and you replied and said this

20

statute doesn't apply to -these actions.

21

ssing you about it.

22
23
24
25

A

And I am just quis-

Mr. Justice White, you have thought of an

aspect of this case that I never thought of and that's — that
is What my surprise stems from.
Q

We've all been caught in your posture at some
11

I

time, so don't let it worry you.

2
3

Q

a general savings section.
A

4

5

I would suggest to you that Georgia does have

Meaning that the remedies continue on, 1 take

it.

©

Q

I suggest it probably does.

1

Q

Wasn't it in this case the provision in the :-

&

bond for double damages?

9

isn't there?

10

A

There is a bondsman in this ease?

No; there isn’t a bandsman* because we never

‘i 1

put up the bond in this case, so. that's how we got here was by

12

refusing to put up the bond.
Well, I'll just go.'on because I’m — let me just

13
14

finish why i'think it 1,3 ““- aside from your point, Mr . Justice

\5

White, assuming that wesre out of — on that point, let me

m

just continue through the other arguments,
There seem to be three reasons why we still are in

17
18

court, unless there is no savings statute: one is that those

19

ladies are subject to double damages; the second is that -the

20

question of the whole statutory scheme involved in here, both

21

303 and 305, even if there is a problem about 303 and I think

22

in being honest with the Court, I must say that there is a

23

problem with that; mootness in this case about 303.

24

the

25

to the posting of the bond and there is no way that I can

posting

That is'the

of the bond ~ that is the provision that relates

12

I

figure out that 303 has direct consequences on our clients.

2

I think there is a serious problem with mootness , narrowly

3

seen in this-case on 303.
The final point I think should he made on mootness,

4
5

as this Court has often expressed the view that when there is

6

a case that is capable of repetition, yet evading review,

7

mootness should not be read narrowly, but should be read in the:

8

larger sense»

9

problem, because of the many other cases you have that would

And I think in this case that would ba the

10

deal with the same issue; indeed, there is another case in

11

Oregon that's going to corae up.

12

Main© case which I believe is recorded in our brief, a Maine

13

case on a vary similar issue.
This really is a case that the Court, I suspect

14
IS

would be asked to deal with on a number of other occasions.
Unless the Court has any further questions, I'll

16
17
18

As you .well know, there's a

close ©n the mootness right there.

I see the Court is very

troubled by this and by tomorrow when we finish this argument,

19

I certainly will have an answer for you about the saving

20

statute.

21

22
23
M

25

With the Court's permission I'll just take e few
minutes and talk about the substantive issue.
We, in our brief, talk a lot about equal protection.
One of the good thing about the fact of coming to the Supreme
Court is that you have a long time to think about your cases

13

1

and chaw them up for a long time»

2

equal protection arguments- the lass excited I am by it and the

3

more I think about the due process argument the more excited

4

1 am by it..

5

The more I think about the

1 come here today, not asking you to decide this
I think in many dissents

6

ease ©n equal protection grounds.

7

before this Court and in many majority opinions of this Court,

8

misgivings have been expressed about equal protection, which

9

suggest that equal protection is a doctrine that ought fc© b©

10

carefully dealt with, I think, and I don31 think we need to asi

II

the Court to go as far as equal protection with its notions

12

of compelling state interest aid its notions of more complicate©

13

adjudication of constitutional issues»

14

We’re talking about a very narrow little question,

15

and that is the right to get into court and we’re, it seems to

m

ms, right within Sniadach, and we're right within Goldberg.

17

tet is finish today’s presentation by suggesting

18

just two ways in which I think we’re even -and narrow? we

19

present a narrower issue to you than was presented in Sniadach

20

and Goldberg.

21

Inthe Sniadach case, for example, there’s no finding

22

©f indigency? indeed, there's a specific question raised as

23

to whether Mrs. Sniadach is indigent.

24

clear in the record that we have a finding of indigency, so

25

you are dealing with an easier problem, from that sense.

14

We’re indigent.

It’s

1

Finally --- secondly in both Sniadach and Goldberg

2

the deprivation it is talking about is only a temporary

3

deprivation of the use of property and that was pointed out, 1

4

believe# in a dissent in that case# very clearly that the use

5

of the property is what was involved»
/

6

In our case# one they're out# they're out; that's

7

it.

That's a final deprivation of the property.

8

case# too# and for that reason — excuse me# sir.

In that

9

Q

I thought you said she left it voluntarily.

10

A

11

What I*m talking about is the general statutory

12

scheme and comparing it to Sniadach where somebody is only

13

deprived of the use of his wages# but where an eviction is

14

carried out in Georgia it ip a final eviction; there is no way

15

to get back# I'm suggesting that this is a more severe punish­

16

ment than the Court faced in Sniadach.

Yes# sir.

17

Q

IS

subjected to punishment?

19

A

Ho# sirs not in this case.

20

Q

What was she subjected to?

21

Well# are you suggesting that she has b®en

She lived there;

paid her mortgage?

22

A

She did.

23

Q

And left?

24

A

She did.

25

There is a very interesting discussion in the
15

1

Goldberg cases the consequences of welfare and why welfare is

2

a right and one of the 'points the Court makes in that case is

3

that welfare guards against societal malaise and it really is

4

a useful thing«

5

welfare.

/

It helps the pursuit of happiness to have

Let's say that * it seems to me* again, wa are an

6

7

easier case h©re, because does not only staying in the house

8

guard against this sort ©£ malaise, but the kind of evictions

9

which, are carried forth really provoke societal malaise.

10

One of the things

11

Q

12

You said that phrase three times and 1 never

understood it.

13

A

Well, sir, 1 take it that it means —

14

Q

Not what it means; 1 didn't even hear it.

15

A

Societal malaise is a phrase that the Court

16

uses in the Goldberg case and it says we want to guard against

17

that.

1©

What I think happens in eviction cases is that

IS

people get put out on the street.

20

cases, a sort of administrative determination being made from

21

in some downtown office.

22

right out on 'the street in^poor neighborhoods.

23

is the major creator of societal malaise.

M

Instead of, as in welfare

In eviction cases people are put

Those are the distinctions that I think exist or the
reasons that X think' that this ease is easier than the
