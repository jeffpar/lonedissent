MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We shall hear argument in

Case No. 18 in the matter of the application of Martin Stoiar.

Mr. Boudin, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ARGUMENT OF LEONARD B. BOUDIN

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. BOUDIN;

7

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

8

Court;

We seek review here of the order of the Ohio Supreme

9

Court, denying the opportunity to the petitioner to take the

10

Ohio bar examinations, because he refused, on ground of First

11

Amendment right of association and belief and the Constitutional

12

privilege under the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination,

13

both as incorporated in the Fourteenth, to refuse to answer

14

three questions which appear upon page 5 of the petitioner’s

15

brief.

16

The first question was "State whether you have been,

17

or presently are, a member of any organization which advocates

18

the overthrow of the government of the United States by force.

19

If your answer to any section of the above question is ’Yes’

20

set forth the facts in detail."

2i

The second question is "List the names and addresses

22

of all clubs, societies or organisations of which you are or

23

have been a member.91

24
25

And a third question, on a different questionnaire,
was "List the names and addresses of all clubs, societies or

2

V
1

organisations of which you are or have been, a rammer since re­

2

gistering as a law student.”

3

The petitioner answered an entire series of questions

4

on these questionnaires.

5

admitted to the New York Bar# and was seeking admission to the

6

Ohio Bar# he being employed in Ohio la a community legal-

He had been# shortly prior thereto#

%

7
8
9
10

service organisation under the auspices of the* O.E.O.
And he declined originally to answer these questions
in writing# stating his Fifth Amendment objection.
When he had an interview with the two members of the

11

sub-committee# the character committee# he persisted in his re­

12

fusal relying either then or shortly thereafter by letter upon

13

his First Amendment right, of association.

14

Upon being pressed# however# in the oral examination

15

that occurred between one young man and two not-much-older

16

members of the character committee# he answered# as appears on

17

page 6# all of the specific questions the committee appears to

18

have put to him# and finally "that he is not now and has never

19

been a member of the Communist Party# or any socialist party#

20

or ©f the Students for a Democratic Society and that he has

El

signed the standard U.S. Army pre-induction security oath#

22

which has reference to the 9Attorney General9s List9#" the

23

same list that was involved in Schneider v. Smith.

24
25

The committee# which the reports that are in the
record here indicate# was very much impressed with his sincerity#
3

1

with his ability, his forthrightness, his reliance on principle

2

And one of them indeed said that, but for the failure

3

to answer on the record made, he would recommend the admission

4

of the petitioner, provided that his colleagues would do so.

5

But his colleagues refused to do so, stating that because the

6

questions had been asked--and they regarded the Konigsberg

7

case as authority for these more general questions—-they would

8

not recommend his admission to the Bar.

%

The matter went to the character committee as a

9
to

whole.

The chairman wrote to the petitioner, he again declined

1!

to answer, and when the matter came before the Supreme Court

12

of Ohio, he then retained counsel, present counsel, who wrote

13

to the Court pointing out that even under the decision of

14

Judge Friendly6s court, in the case next before your honors,

15

which had just come down, each of these three questions vio­

16

lated the rule of precision.
While counsel took issue with Judge Friendly's

17
18

decision, feeling that it had not gone far enough, as Mr.

19

Dorsen will indicate in the next case, it seemed rather clear

20

that, under Judge Friendly's decision, these questions were

21

improper.

22
23
24
25

The Court, nevertheless, being obviously of a con­
trary view, denied petitioner admission to the Ohio Bar, and
this lawsuit resulted.
Now, we make three points.

The first is the

4
(

i

precision argument, an argument well-supported by -tbs cases

2

which X will develops, unlike ray last argument here, Host of

3

the time, so that it can foe presented clearly to the Court,

4

because it involves this very case,

S

The second is the Fifth Amendment privilege argument,

6

which has been adverted to by Mr. Baird, and 1 will simply add

1

several distinctions in terms of points that can be made between

8

this and Spevack.

9

And the third is -the argument that there is no sub­

10

stantial State interest, either in the general inquiry with res­

11

pect to advocacy and with respect to membership in organisations

12

with political advocacy, regardless of what it is, that the

13

First Amendment is also a bar to such questions, and, more

14

specifically, that in this particular case, in this record, no

15

substantial interest has been shown to justify the inquiry of

16

the State»

?1

How, very briefly, because X went into a long line in
i

!8

my last argument here, let me state that these questions with

19

respect to political advocacy and political association, are

20

claimed to have some relationship to the question of moral fit­

21

ness for admission to the practice of the law®

22

And w@ agree, of course, that the moral fitness is as

23

important a consideration as technical ability.

2A

fitness that we think

25

Mr® Justice Franlsfurter in Sshware, where he said that from a

Eut the moral

this is relevant to is that stated by

5

1

profession charged with responsibilities, there must be exacted

2

those qualities of truth-speaking, of a high sense of honor,

3

of granite discretion, of the strictest observance of fiduciary

4 I
*

responsibility that have, throughout the centuries, been, com-

5

pendiously described as moral character.

6
7

And, as Mr. Justice Black stated in Konigsberg, it
is an absence of conduct constituting moral turpitude.

8

We think, and we shall leave it -—• at this point,

9

that, if one examines the questions of this nature that have

10

been put to the members of the Bar in the 1920s, the period in
'

tl

which Mr. Chief Justice Hughes, later Chief Justice Hughes,

12

defended the right of the Socialist lawyers to be members of

13

the New York State legislature.

14

Or in the 1950s, the so-called Cold War period of

15

the late 1940s, we see that this question which is directed to

16

lawyers in a number of States, is a question that actually was

17

directed to every conceivable occupation from the piano-tuners

18

in the District of Columbia, discussed by Professor Gellhorn

19

in the book we have cited, to teachers, people of the merchant :

20

marine and in the private sectors of motion pictures, tele­

21

vision, radio—and that the objective is always the same ob­

22

jective, a general fear in 1920 and 1921 of the Russian Revo­

23

lution, a fear in 1947 and 1948 of an international Communist

24

movement threatening the foundations of society, as the Court

25

indicated in Konigsberg, and was not really based upon any

6

|

I
1

concern that even Communist, lawyers were a threat to the Bar.

2

As I indicated in my last argument, really when one

3

looks at the record of those who we think—that is all we can

4

5

say here--were Communist lawyers, there is no evidence at all
...
.
.
j
that political affiliation, advocacy, even in that organisation,

6

pinpointed by Konigsberg, presented a threat to orderly judi­

7

cial processes.

8

10

But, again, while I think that the important prin'
|
cipie is one that ought to be established in this case, I think
I
we can turn to our case, which does not involve the question of:

11

Communist Party membership, but involves the principle of the

12

rule of precision, which this Court has laid down in repeated

13

cases, some before Konigsberg—1 think NAACP v. Alabama was

14

one of those-—and many of those after Konigsberg, such as

IS

this Schneider, and Baggett v. Bullitt, and the lot.

s

I

9

!i
|

I
16

And in those cases the general principle is that,

17

where freedom of association or of privacy may be involved,

18

the State, even where it has a substantial interest, that

19

State must use methods which will minimise the effect up-on

I

.

20
21

freedom of association.

I

The question is has that happened in the present

22

case with these questions, not the Konigsberg questions and

23

not anything else.

24

not and that this case is clearly governed by Schneider v.

25

Smith and by Shelton v. Tucker, and that all three questions

1
Now,-we suggest, your honors, that it does ■

7

1

constitute the unlimited indiscriminate search referred to in

2

Shelton v. Tucker;, because they call for, and in one case, all

3

organizations within a certain category without naming them,

4

leaving them to the individual to figure out which they are,

5

and all clubs, societies and organizations in the second case»

6

i

So far as the second group of questions is concerned,j

7

your honors will see that Judge Friendly, at page 161 of the

8

record in the nest case, commended the Appellate Division in

I
I

9

New York for having stricken out questions calling for that

!0

broad indiscriminate question of all organisations, societies,

11

saying that they knew something in. that respect about problems

12

relating to the First Amendment»

33

And, of course, as I indicated before, you didn't

34

have whatever objections we, standing on this side of the

IS

table, have to Konigsberg.

16

precision, because there is no question that the Communist

17

Party is a Communist party.

38

was related to.

19

some question as feo what membership is, this Court apparently, .

20

in Killian, did not feel any such difficulty.

You did not have the problem of

Everybody knew what the question

And while it might be argued that there is

|

21

And, of course, you also had in Konigsberg, as I

22

will refer to later on, a specific finding made by all three

23

branches of Government, and, as the majority opinion said in

24

361 or 366, the second case, findings of fact supported by

25

this Court's decision.

I

3

i

i

Now, Judge Friendly in the New York case found two

2

objections to Question 12(g)»

3

knowledge on the part of the applicant with respect to the

4

purposes of the ©rganisatio.no

5

lacked contemporaneity, that is? concurrence of knowledge of

6

the unlawful advocacy of the organisation.,

7

The first was that it lacked

And the second was that it

.

And sof on that principle,, these questions would
!

8

be invalid^ -that is, Question 12(g).
.

9

In addition, we have urged, and this will be developed
I

10

further by Professor Dorsert when he argues the next case, that I

It

he is directing his focus on the —— questions, that the ele­

12

ments which the Court has found to exist as taking something

13

out of the protected area, the elements based upon — and

14

Brandenburg, of adherence to the purposes of the organisation,

15

not merely knowledge, a specific intent to advance them,

16

the quality of the incitement, and the advocacy, and possibly

17

■■■
even, as Brandenburg held, and that was a criminal case,

18

>
imminent danger to the community, that those elements should be:

J

\

19

embodied in a question, if questions at all are to be asked.
j

20

Now, we have —

21

Q

Was Judge Friendly overruling Brandenburg?

22

A

1 should add, Judge Friendly did not agree with

23

those standards.

He did not believe that it was necessary to

24

apply the Brandenburg test, and I don't think he articulated

25

his reasons for not deleting it.

9

I
j
I

1

Now, we have reasons why we think that even all those!
!

2

elements, Brandenburg, Konigsberg, -- , all of these questions,j

3

do not. solve the problem, because they represent a restriction

4

upon association, which is deleterious and which is not neces­

3

sary to advance even the interests of the Stata, if they are

6

regarded as substantial here.

j

7

For one thing, the questions that are put, whether

8

they had the elements or not, require the applicant to make a

9

judgement as to whether the organisation fits into one political

10

category or another.

n

—— and Dennis have indicated, it is very difficult to make

12

such a judgement.

13

unlawful advocacy and lawful advocacy, a line which at least

14

should be made in a record before a court or a jury, under

15
16
17

IS
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

And as the Court's opinions in Note and

There is a very thin line sometimes between
’

judicial procedures, and not --- to the subjective judgement
of the applicant, — by the subjective judgement of his interrogators, who may be —~ or members of character committees,
but normally taken from an area of society to which the appli­
cant may not belong.
And to risk the perjury prosecution from the declara-j
tion here, something we think suggested in a different contest
in Baggett v. Bullitt, where you had vague questions, to risk
II
that in this area is a reason for not using it and for sear­
ching a different method of interrogation.
We think also the consequences of asking these
10

!

questions are three.

2

when 2 argued the --- case before Judge B---# and that is the

3

question of 'the "chilling effect."

4

The question that was put last time

A law student--not everyone# but many—who knows that j

5

he is going to be asked these questions not by a committee of

6

his peers but by a committee ©f older# more conservative gentle ;
.

1
7

men# perfectly respectable — # just as good as he# but with a

8

different point of view# may very well be afraid to join orga-

9

nisafcions as a law student or college student.

10

|

Why should he take the chance?

Why should he march
!

n

in a peace parade, as one man did only t© be held up in Mew

12

York for several months while they casually speculated on why

i3

he marched 1b that peace parade?

14

jI

And so a young mein will have a tendency to say# let
!

15

me be careful, let me clear out of this# if I am going to join

16

anything# I will join it after I become a member of the Bar#

17

if I want to take that chance.

18

j

j
I
The second is that we have to think of the indepen-

19

dence of the Bar# which is much more than a phrase to all of us ,

20

on both sides of this table.

21

W® want a Bar that is not colored ;
I
politically# which does not have to pass a political test—it

22

passes a test of conduct# but not a political test of associa™

23

felons# of beliefs# of advocacy.

24
25

And finally we have the problem.# and a very important
problem# of the impact on the clients.

11

i

There are minority groups--they are black, they are

1
2

white.

There are dissident gorups, there are radical groups.

3

Many of them think, sometimes 1 think mistakenly, that they

4

should have more confidence in a lawyer who thinks generally
;

5

along their lines, -that, they will get a better assistance from

6

such a lawyer.

As 1 say, 1 am not sure they are right.

But

'

7
8

9
10

U
12

they feel that way.
And the question is whether we are going to say to
the young groups, of minority groups, of dissident groups—and
dissidenc® has a very wide range—we are going to screen out

i
your lawyers, we are going to be sure that the lawyers you get =
are the kind -that we think ought to be members of the Bar, and

n

those who may very well b© more sympathetic to your purposes

14

are the lawyers we are not going to let you have.

Q

Would you think that the Bar examiners could

appropriately asks

Do you believe in the overthrow' of the

I

j

Government of the United States by force and violence?

Not

j

whether you are a member of any party or committee, but do you j
|
believe in it?
A

I believe that a question concerning belief,

your honor, is sacrosanct.

I do not believe that such a

question may be asked.

;

There are people, Justices on this Court, there are
j
such eminent people as Professor Emerson, who believe that all j
advocacy is a fora of protected expression.
12

1 believe that,

'i
2

too
But whatever may be the dispute with respect to ad™

3

vocacy, no one has ever suggested, whether in the political

4

field or otherwise—-and I think 'the political field is pecu­

5

liarly delicate™™that the — of what writings you have read,

6

that belief must be absolutely protected from inquiry.

7

The question that arises now, your honors, is whe­

8

ther, given the picture that I have given you ©f the reasons

9

why we should have a more restricted means of inquiry—granted

10

arguendo a substantial State interest here—isn’t there a means

11

which has a less chilling effect?

i

!2

And 1 suggest to year honors that a less drastic

1-3

means, to use a term used in innumerable decisions of this

14

Court, would permit the elimination of screening of this kind,

IS

even one more specific, and would have a number of other tests.

16

(A) If you had to have arty screening at all, you

17

would have a screening which you could say would only be with

18

respect to specific organisations, organisations found by ju­

19

dicial writ—take the Dermis, the — v. CP, cases I obviously

20

j
disagree with, but still cases in which the due process aspect,:
{
the judicial findings of fact cannot be attacked on Constitu­

21

22
23

24
2S

tional grounds.
Q

Mr. Boudin, time is up, but as I recall it—I

don8t remember the name of the case—Mr. Justice Roberts, in
an opinion for Jehovah8s Witness stated many years ago other

13

1

things can be attacked, but beliefs are sacred and cannot be

2

questioned.

3

name of the case.

If you would find that, 1 donct remember the

I will find that by tomorrow morning, but I

subscribe to it even now.
