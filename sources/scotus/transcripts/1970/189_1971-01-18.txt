2 First of the Railway Labor Act.

The provision that says

that it shall be the duty of parties to a railway labor
J
dispute to exert every reasonable effort to dispose of
their cases.
More precisely# the question is whether#if a
union violates Section 2 First# may a company secure its
notwithstanding the fact that all ©£ the other formal pro­
cedural requirements of the act have been met.

That is to

say that conferences have been held and that mediation has
been had and the board has terminated jurisdiction and either
an emergency board has or hasn't been appointed# but in many
cases the relevant cooling off period has run.
And I think that I can summarise very briefly the
factual events that led to the presentation of this issue here,
2

f

1

The dispute between the parties had to do with the

2

number of brakemen that should be employed upon the trains of

3

the NOrth Western.

4

broader long-standing controversy between the railroads and

S

the unions with respect to a wide range of work rules that the

6

railroads have maintained are unduly burdensome anachronisms.

7

I suppose the most prominent example of this

3

problem has to do with the use of firemen on diesel locomo­

9

tives .

IQ

This is a part or an aspect of a much

sort of a

With respect to the brakeman problem the carriers

11

of the country secured very substantial relief in the mid-

12

1960s by virtue of a compulsory arbitration statute thatwas

13

enacted by the Congress in late 1963.

14

legislation arbitration boards sat across the country and the

IS
IS
1?

And pursuant to that

consequence was that the carriers were authorised to
eliminate thousands and thousands of brakeman positions, all,
however, subject to the obligation to proecfc existing employees .

18

Now, on the North Western the authorization for

19

elimination went to something in the way of 2G0 crews which

20

represented a substantial saving of something in the way of

21

$2 million a year.

22

1966 and so in June and July of 1965 the union began its

23

24
25

But these awards expired in January of

efforts to recapture its positions by serving upon some 80odd railroads Section 6 proposals which would have restored
all of the eliminated positions.

It was by the terms of the awards Mr, Justice ;

Blackman, as required by the statute,

S

Was that expiration by the very terms of the

award and —

4

Q

Q

What was the — if there was a terminal

point on that presumably corrective action?
A•

7

Well, the hope of the Congress, I take it,

3

was that during this two-year period, as some of the courts

9

have indicated who have reviewed this matter, that a new

10

plateau of work rules and manning regulations would be

11

achieved through collective bargaining.

■r

The alternative, of course, is to make the

12

13

solution a permanent one and Congress drew back from that in

14

the hope that the parties would work out their own differences

15

during this period.

IS

matured,

17

But, unhappily, that hope has not

- _

And what happened then at the expiration©f the

18

awards was that the union in pursuit of these Section 6

19

notices, insisted upon carrier-by-carrier negotiation which

20

put them in a position to call whipsaw strikes

21

individual railroads.

22

series of strikes and threats of strikes in "68 and s69.

23

the consequence of that was surrender by most of the nation's

24'

railroads of practically all the benefits that they had secured

25

under these arbitration awards»

against

And the consequence of all that was a

4

And

1

Now, the union got to the North Western rather

2

late in this series of mediations, but in any case, con-

3

ferences were had; mediation was held and the board terminated

4

its jurisdictionover the case in October of 1969i October

3

16th, I believe»

0

So that the 3Q~day cooling off period ran on

7

November 16 of 1969 and three days later the North Western

8

brought this suit, alleging that though conferences had been

9

had and mediation had been held they were not the sort of

10

conferences and they were not the sort of mediation contem­

11

plated by the act because the union, it was charged, had not

iZ

fulfilled its obligations in terms of bargaining that were

13

imposed upon it by Section 2 First»

14
15

The District Court granted a restraining order;
a hearing was had on the motion for preliminary injunction, but.
I

16

at the conclusion of the North Western's evidence the District

V?

Court dismissed the complaint without reaching the merits of

m

the allegations on the grounds that Section 2 First of the act :

19

is not enforceable by the courts but only by the National

2©

Mediation Board,

*

The District Court did grant, an injunction pending

21
appeal»

After an expedited appeal the Court of Appeals
1-

affirmed on the same- rationale, but recognising that its
decision was contrary to the decisioxi of the 4th Circuit in the
Piedmont Aviation case, the Court of Appeals stayed its mandate j
5

1
■

!
2

pending the outcome of these proceedings before this Court.
Now,» here the Respondent urges the adoption of a

3

rationale of the lower courts, that is Section 2 First does

4

not impose judicially enforceable obligations.

5

The AFL amicus curiae, on the other hand?
'.j

'

0

suggests that even if 2 First is judicially enforceable, that ■

1

the mode of enforcement .should not include strike injunctions 1

8

«

because of the prohibitions of the Norris~La Guardia.

%

I want, of course, to touch upon both strands of-

10

these arguments, but before I do that I should like to

ii

indicate to the Court the range of different kinds of problems

12

that have been dealt with by the courts under Section 2 First.;

13

Because it* is our view that if the decision of the lower court

14

is affirmed there will be a very dislocating effect with

15

respect to a substantial and important body of case law that

10

has been built up on the premise that Section 2 First is

17

enforceable.

IS

Now, of course one kind of case is the one that

m

was alleged in the court below: in

-

and I won't go into

20

the evidence because the lower courts never reached it, but

21

the character of the allegations gotfeo whathas been called

22

"subjective bad faith" bargaining, at least many of the

23

allegations go to that.

24

which it's charged that the union came to the bargaining

25

table with a predetermined position and a determination not to

It was, in the terms

And the only option given

Now, I should like to indicate that 2 First is

1

a two-way street with respect to this kind of charge, as the

8

pending litigation brought by the United States against the

9

Florida-East Coast Railway indicates.

We have described that
I

litigation in our supplemental reply brief.

10

But there, the Government, joined by the unions,

12

is asserting that the railroad, the Florida-East Coast, should

13

not be permitted to put into effect its sweeping Section 6

14

proposals, notwithstanding the fact that it has exhausted ©JJ.

15

the formal procedures of the act on the grounds, as the

16

Government charges, that the railroad has not complied with

17

its bargaining obligations, under Section 2 First,
Now, there is another kind of a problem, one that

18
19

the courts have dealt with under 2 First, and that has to do

20

with the bargaining authority of the collective bargaining

21

representatives.

22

evidence showed that the union representatives refused even

23

to discuss a compromise proposal by the railroad that would

24

have involved the payment of very substantial additional com­

23

pensation to the existing employeess something in the way of

chance to put a case in — that on the carrier's evidence it

showed that the reasons that the agents, the collective bar­

something in the way of 30 to 40 lower court decisions in our

While it asserts that the moratorium clause is

not valid, either because it’s hostile to the purposes of the

the lower courts have considered and decided those cases and

necessary that they be accompanied, but they may be accompanied

Q

Right»

Usually not quite that long»

Do you have any of your cases that you have

20

cited directed to enforcing the obligation, not only to

21

bargain, but to bargain in good faith or to make — what does

22

the statute-say, '’make reasonable offers»"

23

24
25

i

Are they directed

specifically to analysing what reasonable efforts are?
A

Some are»

X think the bulk of the cases •

probably are directed to the kind of problems that Ism talking

10

1

about now ~

2

Q

Or just flat refusals to bargain at all?

3

A

No? I don't think there are many flat

4

refusals to bargain.

The question is always --

S

Q

Not since the Virginia.

6

A

Not since Virginia? that's right.

But there

7

could be a situation of a flat refusal to bargain on the

8

basis ©f a position of law that the moratorium clause- does ©r

9

does not bar the proposal.

10

Q

11

faith bargaining

12

A

That kind of a case will Arise.

Do you equate these two phrases;

■uhe good

and the duty to use every reasonable effort?
Mr. Chief Justice, I don't, myself.

I think

13

that — I read Section 2 first as somewhat a broader provision

14

than the good faith bargaining clause in the LMRA and I

IS

suggest that the kinds of cases I am describing now indicate

16

that it is.

17

fall under Section 301 jurisdiction of the LMRA but under the

18

Railway Labor Act there is no equivalent and so it's put under

m

Section 2 First.

The enforceability of a moratorium clause may

20

Nov?, I think in one ~~ in the Chicago-Rock Island

21

case Judge Friendly observed that Section 2 First was written

22

in somewhat broader language and it might well have a broader

23

scope.

24
2B

For example; the lower courts have also decided
whetherthe bargaining unit should be a multi-employer unit
11

1

in a particular controversy or a single employer unit in a

2

single controversy, depending upon which of those methods of

3

negotiation seem to give the greater promise of a peacable

4

resolution of the problem and they decided that under Section

5

2 First, and 1 think there is no equivalent kind of decision

©

under the LMRA good faith bargaining clause®

7

So that the lines of cases that I. am -talking about

8

may fall someplace else under the LMRA, but I don't think they

9

fall under the good faith bargaining provision of the LMRA*

10

And finally, I should mention the role that

11

Section 2 First plays in the status quo provisions of the act®

12

Mow, in Jacksonville Terminal and in, last year in Detroit

13

and Toledo Shoreline, this Court indicated that the structure

14

of the act contemplated that both parties maintain the status

15

quo during the exhaustion of all of the major disputes pro­

16

cedures of the act®

17

And there is no difficulty here if one looks at

18

the status quo provisions that come into play when the

19

mediation board terminates its services because Sections 5 and

20

10 clearly apply to both parties®

21

a textual difficulty with respect to Section © which governs

22

the relations ©f the parties during this whole period of

23

conferences and mediation because Section 6, in terms applies

M

only to -the carriers®

25

But there is a difficulty,

Now, it's plain"to me that the court discerned
12

!

that difficulty in writing the Shoreline case because after

2

describing these various status quo provisions in 6, 5 and

3

10, the Court concluded by saying thiss these provisions must

4

be read in connection with the implicit status quo requirement

S

in the obligation imposed upon both parties by Section 2

6

First,
Now, the point that I want to make ,1s that where

1
8

such an important and variegated structure of ease law has

S

been built in this area upon the premise that Section 2 First

10

is enforceable, and enforceable by strike injunction because

1?

every case that I have talked about is a strike injunction

32

ease.

13

Now, the Respondent, I respectfully submit, has

14

a heavy burden to meet in showing that indeed Section 2 First

15

is not enforceable,

16

Now, let me briefly talk about the arguments made

17

on both sides.

38

ciability first, putting eiside for the moment the Norris-

10

La Guardia Act.

20

I'd like to discuss the question of justi­

We say in the first place that the language of

21

the statute strongly supports us.

It says that "it shall be

22

the duty of theparties to comply with 2 First»'8

23

we say that the legislativehistory ©f the act supports us,

again quite strongly.

Secondly,

We discussed it in some detail on

13

review it in detail here* but by way of illustration, let me

2

simply say that Mr.

Richfoerg, who discussed this matter with
■

/

'

3

the Unions in the hearings of some considerable length, sum­

4

marised his position by saying this about Section 2 First;

5

"The legal obligation is imposed, and as I have

6

previously stated, and I want to emphasise it, I believe that

7

the deliberate violation

8

prevented by court compulsion.

9

trary in the legislative history of this provision."

of that legal obligation could be
There is nothing to the con­

19

Now, third, and I suppose really first in order of

11

importance, this Court in Virginian Railway, held that Section

12

2 First is enforceable by the courts.

13

There this Court en­

forced an injunction or affirmed the validity of

an injunction

14

against the carrier which not only bound it to treat with the

15

employees within the meaning of Section 2 Nine, but also to

18

exercise, exert, every reasonable effort to settle their

17

dispute with the union under Section 2 First.

18

And it was argued to this Court that Section 2

19

First is not justiciable and this Court rejected that conten­

20

tion.

21

one of those that is quoted in page 50 of our brief.

22

just read one sentence of its

I think the key paragraph, perhaps in the opinion is

"It,” that is the statute, "at least requires the

In short* to

enter into a negotiation for the settlemtn of labor disputes

This is what the

Court said 'there:

provisions»
Now* the Respondent and the. lower .court rely upon

10

MKT, but in MKT this Court, simply held that Section 2 Minth

19

of the act was designed specifically t© cover representational

20

di sputes aand that provision withdrew ‘those disputes from the

21

court»

22

And it simply said with respect to 2 First and 2

Second that these more generally phrased provisions could not

23

detract from that more specific intent* going to that kind of

24

dispute»

25

i

But we don't have-a representational dispute here

1

and this Court has never said anything that in any way in­

2

timates that it ever intended to cut into Virginian»

3

Just a word or two about the mediation board»

4

The lower courts thought thatthe mediation board had authority

5

to enforce Section 2 First.

6

doesn't say that.

7

line last year, in rejecting a long-standing interpretation

3

of the board of the act, said that the beard has no adjudica­

9

tory responsibility in major disputes.

10

In the first place the statute

This Court, in Detroit and Toledo Shore-

Secondly, the legislative history, again which we

1?

set forth in detail in our brief, shows that the Congress,

12

that the framers ©f the act, rather, were anxious to withdraw

13

any adjudicatory authority from the board so as to preserve

14

its neutrality, its ability to conciliate.
Next, the board has never, as a matter of prac­

15
16

tice, enforced 2 First, as the materials which we set ^Sorth in

1?

our brief establish, I -think.

18

ought to be noted that the mediation board would be powerless

19

to enforce Section 2 First in a very great many cases because

20

one© the board releases its jurisdiction then it's out of the

21

picture for the 30-day cooling off period after that and for

22

the next SO days associated with the hearings proceedings of

23

emergency.

And -then, finally 1 think it

24

And so for these reasons we urge that Section 2

25

First is judicially enforceable bythe courts and not by the
16

1

boards

2

Now, as to Norris-LaGuardia —

3

Q

May I ask —

4

A

Yes,

5

Q

Mr» Justice White»

If the parties absolutely refuse to bargain,

6

or one of them does and the mediation, board is in it and the

7

parties still refuse to bargain, what could the mediation

8

board do about it, except terminate?

9

A

I think they have to terminate, Mr. Justice

50

White; that9s what the statute to me says.

11

the board has exhausted to bring the partiesto an agreement

12

and they can't do it, that it's supposed to release the case.

13

As a matter of fact, I understand that in the Florida-East

14

Coast case where the Government is now urging that the

15

Florida-East Coast.'violated Secton 2 First by not bargaining.

16

The Florida-East Coast sued the mediation board to get them

17

to release the case and the mediation board released the case

18

before that case went to trial.

19

It says that when

I think the mediation board is obliged t© release

20

it after a reasonable period of time and I think they do that.

21

I don4t think that the Government would be taking the position

22

in Florida-East, Coast that the railroad had violated

23

if it also thought that the mediation board had violated its

24

responsibility by releasing that case.

remedy because it would require a bad faith bargaining suit to
be instituted right in the middle of negotiations in the early

Indeed*

we think that’s what this Court said in substance last year
in Boys River in discussing the availability of a damage -There the court said that the institution of that kind of
litigation would be damaging to the relationship between the
parties.
How* besides that* and equally important* we're
dealing here with -the statute in which the negotiating periods
are long and protracted and if the carrier were to come into
court in the early or middle stages of those periods the
union would always be able to says well* now* look there is
a long road ahead of us and positions inevitably change and
it is simply too early to make a determination but you are
19

not bargaining in good faith andthat is precisely what the

2

courts have said — the court said in the only case that we

3

have been able to discover in which that kind of relief was

4

sought: the District Court in the northern District of

S

Georgia in an opinionaffirmed by the Fifth Circuit Court of

So that it is only at the terminal stages when a

t

Section 2 First., with which we are dealing here,

z

was not ever intended by Congress and has never been held by

3

this Court to be judicially enforceable»

4

intended by Congress to be enforceable by the National

S

Mediation Board through the power of the National Mediation

6

Board to maintain or to continue to require the status quo to

7

be maintained and to prevent self-help, until the mediation

8

board should,be satisfied that the bargaining conduct of the

9

parties had been such as to meet the requirements of Section

Section 2 First was

\>

10

IS

2 First.
And further we would urge, that to subject the

12

bargaining conduct of the parties, both prior to mediation and

13

during the compulsory mediation for which the act provides to

14

a judicial review after mediation would destroy the whole

15

scheme of the Railway Labor Act for the resolution of major

16

disputes? because it would necessarily interferewith the

17

relationship that the National Mediation Board must and does

18

maintain its dealings with the parties in order to bring about

19

agreement and to require it to disclose those — its dealings

20

with the parties who were destroying its effectiveness and

2!

would put the crus at the bargaining table ex post facto,

22

when it was the purpose of the act to limit the functions of

23

the court in these cases.

24
25

Section 2 First first came into railway labor
legislation as Section 301 of Title 3 of the Transportation
21

1

Act of 1920 which set up a system of compulsory arbitration

2

by the Railroad Labor Board' for railway labor disputes.

3

those disputes which were not decided by the parties and

4

Congress under what Section 301 then provided of Title III

5

of the Transportation in almost the same language that the

6

parties

7

putes and those which it eouldn51 resolve were to be decided

8

by the Railway Labor Board»

Of

shall make every reasonable effort to resolve dis­

This Court first considered that provision and

9
10

that language in the Pennsylvania Railroad cases in 1923 and

11

525 and held that Section 301, which is the equivalent now of

12

Section 2 First, the 1926 act was not judicially enforceable,

13

notwithstanding it was couched in mandatory language because

U

of the absence of any provision for a penalty for its viola­

15

tion or any other indication that it was intended to be

16

judicially enforceable»
Following that decision by this Court there

17
18

occurred the 1921-522 shopcraft strike which involved some

19

600 to 7,000 railroad employees and railroad labor relations

20

and railroad labor legislation was a subject of considerable

21

public concern at that time»

It was — the need for change

22

was recognized in the platforms of both political parties? it

23

had been the subject of three Presidential messages to

24

Congress» And when Section 2 First as we now have was enacted

25

it was Section 2 First of the Railway Labor Act of 1926

.

22

1

enacted in those circumstances * and agreement by both parties

z

as to the provisions of the act and it was enacted in sub-

3

stantially the same way* which is Section 3 1 of Title III of

4

the Transportation Act of 192 * and it has remained in those

5

words since .1926.

6

And thus it was enacted without the prohibitory

7

provision or any other prevision that this Court thought in

8

the Pennsylvania cases was necessary to show a judicially
enforceable intent.

10

It has stayed that way since.

In enacting the Railway Labor Act of 1926* the

SI

Senate reports show and the House reports show that the

12

Congress deliberately rejected a compulsory system of resol­

13

ving railway labor disputes with adequate means for judicial

14

enforcement as it might have done merely by making Title III

15

offche Transportation Act of 192

instead the parties agreed to a process which has been in

effect since.

21

the disputes and provided for compulsory mediation by the

23

government agency* the Mediation Board.

But*

It left Section 2 First in its nonjusticiable

It prohibited the status quo being changed

The Virginian case that Counsel spoke of* found
a judicially enforceable obligation in the prohibition of

Up to that time the question of representa­

employees had, was what was the trouble in

But fiin injunction Sni that case prohibited the

9

railroad from dealing'with other than the representatives

10

certified by the mediation board and it also required the

11

railroad to deal with the certified representative and in the

12

manner prescribed by Section 2 First.

13

Court did not suggest that the Dii^ricfe Court retain jurisdic­

14

tion; there had been no negotiations up to that time; didn’t

15

suggest that the District Court retain jurisdiction to deter­

16

mine whether the ensuing negotiations met the requirements of

17

Section 2 First.

18

event conferences failed the services of the mediation board

19

be invoked and thus this Court suggested the antithesis of

20

further litigations, further mediation and the attachment of

21

the jurisdiction of the mediation board to prevent self-help

22

by maintaining the status quo until the mediation board should

23

determine whether there was compliar.ce with 2 First.

24
25

But in .that case the

Instead, this Court suggested that in the

Thereafter, when the lower courts commenced to
assume'jurisdiction of disputes arising under the Railway

24

1

Labor Act, this Court in a trillogy of cases, limited the

2

apparent general jurisdiction of the Federal courts in 1943

and General Committee Adjustment against the MK and T Rail­

And in those cases, in -the

case made it

8

plain again that Section 2 First was not justiciable and the

Court has recognised through the years, most recently under

Mr, Haley, what do you suggest the Court

meant in the Burley case in the language that one of the

23

to reach a solution?

A

-

As 1 interpret that, Mr, Chief Justice,

Justice Rutledge was there speaking of the power of the courts

to maintain the status quo until the mediation board could

8

jurisdiction of the courts to hold the parties into compliance

9

with the status quo provisions until the administrative pro­

10

n

It was

cess of the act had been exhausted.
The National Mediation Board is well aware of its

12

duties and responsibilities to enforce compliance with the

13

provisions of Section 2 First and thus that awareness was

14

perfectly apparent from a recent decision of the Court of

15

Appeals for ’the District

for this Circuit# the District

of Columbia Circuit# in the Machinists case against the
National Mediation Board,
It's also apparent from the speech of Mr, Howard
Ganzer, formerly chairman and a long-time member of the
National Mediation Board and from Professor Smith's article
in the Michigan law Review# together with the complexity of
the problem of determining whether every reasonable effort is
being made# all those recited.

But the Board obtains its

information with respect to the quality of the bargaining#
not in an open hearing# but in conferences with the parties#
26

1

separately and together, as is its usual practice.

2

with each party, obtains the information as to their position;

3

it participates in the bargaining sessions of the parties and

4

considers and observes their conduct during those negotiations

5

and in its private confidential talks with them, and on the

6

basis of its direct contact with tneparties, both secretly,

1

informally and in observing the parties in their'conduct with

8

each other across the bargaining table; necessarily makes a

9

determination as to whether and when each party has made

10

every reasonable effort to resolve the dispute and thus,

11

necessarily decides whether to continue to prevent.the exer­

12

cise of a party, exercise of self-help by a party who is only

13

seeking to go through the motions, something that is hard to

14

conceive that a union would ever do because it can only

IS

accomplish something by securing agreements.

f®

less , it's through that informal method that the mediation

board obtains the information for which it bases a determina­

18

tion as to whether to continue its jurisdiction and thus deny

20

with and the dispute cannot be resolved and the parties should

21

be remitted to self-help.

22

It talks

But, neverthe­

The Board's conclusion that it reaches from its

23

conduct with the parties should not be subject to judicial

24

review because as it. appears from the testimony or from the

legislative history and the information furnished the Court

8

in the Machinists case against the National Mediation Board,,
the legislative purpose, the Congressional purpose for pro­
viding for compulsory mediation of disputes was to cloak the
efforts of the

mediation hoard in or to cover them or to

eliminate them from public scrutiny , because otherwise it
would ba — the effectiveness of the mediation board in determining whether a party was making every reasonable effort,
contemplated by Section 2 First, as well as its mediatory
functions, would be destroyed by requiring it to come into

9
1©

court and tell what each party had said to it? what each party
had said to the other, because in the next case no one would

II
say anything to the mediator or to the National Mediation
12

Board.
13
And for fear that they would then be hailed into
14
court later, but if the mediation board can talk to this
15

m

n

party and find out its position; talk to this party and find
'out its position, it may well bring them together»

situation is true under Section 2 Ninth with respect to the

the parties of the failure of its efforts»

It conducts no

if both parties and the mediation board knew that at the and

as to whether there had been compliance with Section 2 First,

by Congress; there is not a suggestion of it in the hearings

of it; the suggestion is that the process that was being

established was a voluntary function not a compulsory process;

17

not compulsory arbitration such as was done by the Director

General during the government operation of the railroads after

19

which Title III of the Transportation Act of 1920 was patter­

There is not a suggestion

It was not conceived, as was the National Labor

basis.

Had Congress intended courts to play a part in it it

7

could so have provided in 1926* in 1934 when the act was

8

slightly amended; it would have been possible at any juncture

9

t© make Section 2 First justiciable by providing a penalty

19

for its violation or that courts shall have the jurisdiction

11

to determine whether there has been compliance with it* not­

12

withstanding negotiations and mediations and an investigation

13

and report by an emergency board.

14

We respectfully suggest to the Court that it

15

not* o'r I waj.it to mention the Piedmont case because under that

w

case which is — with which 'the Seventh Circuit thought its

17

opinion in conflict* the court remanded the case for a deter­

18

mination by the District Court if it should determine that

19

there was* in fact* a major dispute* whether the conduct of

20

the parties in the prior negotiation and mediation had ful­

21

filled -the requirements of Section 2 First.

N

22

Thus, that court, and to require the redoing,

23

remediation or renegotiation, I assume the courts have the

24

jurisdiction to require that of the dispute until the District

25

Court should be satisfied -that the parties have made every

to call the Court's attention to the relevant statutory pro­
vision here which is Section 5 First of the Act.

It's the

only section in the act which goes to the duties of the

z

mediation board»

controversy and shall use its best efforts by mediation to

5

bring into agreement» if such efforts to bring about an

6

amicable settlement through mediation shall be unsuccessful,

7

the said board shall at once endeavor as its final required

8

action to induce the parties to submit their controversy to

arbitration»

It says this s "that the said board shall

If arbitration shall be refused the board shall

10

at once notify both parties in writing that ites mediatory

u

efforts have failed and then the status quo is held for 30

12

days»11

13

Mr, Haley is speaking of a statutory arrangement

14

under which the decision andto whether 2 First had been com­

15

plied with, would be committed by the Congress to an adminis­

16

trative agency and then it would be specified_that there

17

should be no judicial review of 'those determinations.
Surely the Congress could write such a statute,

18
19

but it is simply importing too much under this statutory

20

language to conclude that that is the system that the Congress

2!

her© established.
Beyond that, the practice of the board has not been

22
23

to decide

a speech given by Mr. Ganser, the former chairman ©£ the board

25

dispute."

language to allow the board to make such a determination,"

10

thing that the board might have to employ.

Ho, there isn5t, Mr. Justice.

v '■';-

that -This Court,

in effect, held in Virginian, because the penalty section does

25

not touch section 2 Ninth, either and ©f course there is no

35

1

dispute that the Court in Virginian held 2 Ninth enforceable

2

«and beyond that; the Court in the Texas and Ho0. case said

*
that the absence of judicial penalty is not determinative

with respect to considering the enforceability of these

sections»

How did it do that?.'

In its opinion it said

if you are going to treat with you have to treat with Section

I am hard pressed t© under­
I was

simply making the point with respect to Mr. Justice Blackmunes
question that even if one put Section 2 First aside, that the
penalty provisions don’t apply to 2 Ninth; either»

And

surely no one would question that Virginian enforced 2 Ninth;
but the way the effort t© distinguish Virginian; I suggest;
simply has to fail; and let me put it this ways if; in the
wake of that affirmance by the Supreme Court of the injunction
in Virginian; the railroad had failed to exert every reasonable

effort^ I submit that a contempt action would lie.

simply did not exhort the parties in Virginian? it affirmed

an injunction that is presumably binding ©n the parties.
