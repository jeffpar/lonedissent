ON BEHALF 03? PETITION 2RS

MR. CHING: Mr. Chief Jus sice, and may it pleas*

fcfa?

10

Court.
This case is here on Writ ofCartiorari to review

II

the

decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The facts

12

&r«.

relatively simple.

13
14
15

The Petitioners here are Adolfo Peres,and his wife,
Enu a Perez. They live in Tuson, Arizona.
('■n July 8, 1965,. Molfo Perez, while driving his

16

family car had an accident. A year or so later, a lawsuit was

17

fi: ed against Adolfo Peres end his wife based on the accident,

m

2. year or so later the Pereses confessed judgement

19

and a judgement and a judgement was rendered against the two

20

of them as husband and wife,

21

Thereafter, Molfo and Emma Peres each filed a peti­

22

tion in bankruptcy. The judgement was scheduled in each of the

23

bankruptcy petitions and in due course the debt was discharged,

24
25

However, Arizona law providas that anyone who has a
judgement of this kind against him will have his drivers license

4

1

and bis car registration suspended, until the judgement or a

2

par

of it is paid,

3

Q

4

wife f then?

5

S

The judgement ran against both the man and the

Yes. That judgement is in the record. It3s not

6

rep: cchased Inthe Appendix, however, it’s in the recordr on

1

page s 54 and 55.
Q

Q
9
10

When you speak of it as a confession of judgement

da yen mean the conventional default judgement where they
dids cfc re spend or did they formally confess?
A

11

The confessior, of judgement was entered by

12

the. i attorney. That is not in the recoxi, but I «ill supply

13

the.-. information to the Court, if the Cot <rt desires

14

tioi, c.

IS

the imforraa-*

The Perezes retained counsel, and an answer was filed

16

denying negligence.On the date of trial, counselor advised the

17

Per zas to confess judgement so that he could take them through

18

ban! i uptcy proceedings.

19

Q

And they theory on tthich the lawsuit was drawn

20

against her, the wife, was what? Because the husband was driving

21

the car. Alone in the car, was he not?

22
23
24
25

A

Yes, the husband w. s alone. This was alleged in

the complaint.
Q

And the complaint joined her as a defendant on

what theory? On the community property theory?

5

1

A

Exactly. In Arizona it is a common practice in

2

su.rg a marital community to sue both t he husband and the wife,

3

Thtj complaint is also in the record, I believe it's page 53 and

4

54 jreceding the judgement

3

produced in the Appendix.

6

n the record, again it’s not re­

the complaint named his a and cane Doe Peres, hisswife,

1

and subsequently the judgement named Errna peras as her name

8

wai

later on knowm.
hut the complaint spelled out that the suit was against

9
10

Adolfo Pert

II

Q

12

2

and the marital com unity lusband and wife.
And the confession of ju Igement was filed on be--

ha.'f of both defendants, mar and wife?
That's fight,.

13

I

14

And so it’s a judgement reciting judgement against

15

Adi lfo and Emma Perez, hurbsnd and wife.
C

16
17

the

18

do; ng that?

19

A

Could the judgement have been entered against:

iriver only, is there ary impediment in Arizona law €o

In Arizona, they—--"a suit can be brought either

20

against the husband or against husband and wife, this is entirely

21

at the option of the Plaintiff.

22

Q

Well, once having been brought against both of

23

them, could a lawful judgement have been entered against the

24

dri.ver only, the husband?

23

A

This is not shown by aby of the case law in Ariz-

6

i

ora, regasrrli.Bg community property.

2

Well if the plaintiffs

md the defendants had

3

agreed upon that, it probably could have been done, is that

4

ccrreefc?

5

k

Most plaintiffs are not willing to do that,

0

because moat plaintiffs felt that the wife has a. job and it will

7

be easier

S

judgement .reads the wifes rune.

ro guarnish •— on the wife ;,f the complaint and the

9

(■n other words aarnings are community property dur­

10

ing marriage, and the judgement against, husband and wife will

11

fa h. litate the guarnishment and axecut: on of a judgement.

12

But the original complaint was based, I suppose,

13

on the husbands negligent conduct in driving the car, is that

14

15

h.

16

(>

Exactly.
Was it based at all on i he-*— against the wife

17

on ihe basis that she had been negligent in lending the car

13

19

A

Mo.

20

Q

It was not based at all on heir independent neg­

*

21

V

ligence, was it?
A

22

Mo, there’s no allegation in the complaint as

23

to that at all.

24

q

25

wrongful injuries were wrongful injuries because of the'husbands

Q

The---of the complaint, that is the wring, the

A

Nothing as to-- nothing in the complaint an to

7

That's correct.

No.
She was joined merely as a member of the communiit]’

th< .t owned the automobile., 1 suppose?

8

J.

That is correct.

9

(<

Where was title to the automobile?

10

i.

11

The title to the automobile is in the name of

Adolfo Peres only.

12

f1

But as a matter of Arizona law, if the auto­

13

mobile was aquired after their marriage, regardless of the title,

14

it nonetheless belonged hall to his wife, is that right?

15

I

Exactly.

10

Yes.

Mr, Ching, dc you know wiether Arizona permits

Q

Would your case ba any <ifferenfe, if this auto­

2

mobile wer-j registered in the names of Adolfo and Emma as joint

te .wants?

4

A

The case would not be my different other than

5

no ; only the community property of the husband and wife but also

6

Em as. Peres

7

otier words,, joint property would make a joint inseparable

8

ob Jgafcion

separate property would then become liable» So in

c;

3

As long as I ve interrupted your one more question

10

Do jou conceed that Arizona could have made insurance precedent

11

to the issuance of a license?
A

12

3

Certainly, Your Honor» And this has been done in

tW' * states. New York, Massachusetts and North Carolina»
After surrending to fcho state their licenses on da­

And thereafter Certiorari was petitioned for by the
Petitioners and this Court cranted
Certiorari»
“*

i

This case involves a very important and alleged con­

22

flict between a state statute and the Federal Bankruptcy Act»

23

This issue has been before the Court twice, within the last

24

20 years, in the case of Reitz vs, Mealy, a new York case, and

25

Kesler v. Department of Public Safety, a case coming from Utah,
9

The statute was upheld under similiar circumstances

!
2

as

3

Oir argument here will be that this Court should re-examine

4

tie earlier cases and after due consideration overrule these

5

cases' because they are not logically sound and that they are

6

new out of date»

7

regarding Adolfo Perez by a divided Court in both cases,

•"rnd also that in applying Ar: zona law*, the rationale

8

used Ly th's Court previously is not applicable. In the Reitz

9

case and in Kesler, this Coart sustained the statute on

the

m

basis that the purposes of these statures are to deter irres­

11

ponsible driving and to prenote public safety which, of course,

12

is a valid exercise of the states police power.

13

'Je would urge the Court to consider our argument

14

than the s tatute really doe snot deter i rresponsible driwinc

15

and does not protect the public safety

16

This type of suspension is not suspension for the

17

conduct of negligent driving, but a suspension for the non-pay­

18

ment of the judgement.

19

q

Well when you use the word "responsible" refer­

20

ring to it, I assume in the statute, ii what sense do you thira

21

that, word is used?

22
23

A

I—

0-

Is it responsible meaning a careful driver, or

24

is it responsible in the sense of a driver who can respond and

25

does respond in damages?
10

A

1

The Arizona statute has for the purpose the

2

financial irresponsible drivers that it's trying to reach, and

3

in t the drivers who are irresponsible Ln their conduct» And

4

I will illustrate that by pointing cut that this Court that

5

Aiisona as in every other state, has criminal sanctions agains

S

7

is;responsible driving, for drunk driving, for manslaughter,
fc r various violations,
md yet under Arizona law, no suspension can be for

8
9
10
11

12

me co -than one year, even if a persons

-- manslaughter, or for twice driving under the influence of
al sohe-l, drunk, he can apply to regain his license after one
ye ir.
ut in this case, a person wl ose license is suspendei

13
14
15
18
17
13

19
20
21

22

.iqense is revoked for

ca» not get his license, and sometimes permanently, until
he |ays that judgement» This I believe demonstrates that public
sa :e ty is rot what is intended by this statute»
The statute is inkfended to ccXlect a debt, to pay
tha victim,
Q

Well don't you suppose that the Arizona legis*

lature had in mind that if there were a criminal conviction,
manslaughter, for example, that there invariably, or then if not;
them almost invariably, there would be a; judgement or a claim
that would be satisfied or else would come under the civil

23
provisions of the statute»
24
A

Exactly» What I'm saying is that for a person who

25

11

'I

ha 3 insurance, who is convicted of mam slaughter, or drunk driv-

2

in3■ his insurance company would pay the judgement, and he can

3

redeem his license, after cie year.

4

)

Well, I thought you had just agreed, in resposa

5

to a question from Mr. Justice Elackmun that the state had the

6

lawful power under its police powers to require insurance. Did

7

I ausunder stand you on that?

3
9

A

No, 1 said a state can require everybody to have

insurance. I'm merely trying to point out to this Court that

10

th ire is as obvious conflict with the bankruptcy Act. Had

11

neither of these Petitioners gone through bankruptcy, then I

12

wo n.d say

13

especially Emma. ;Pares' claim. But now 1 hat both these Petitioners

14

hare cone through bankruptcy, they have the shield of bankruptcy

15

an l theref« re the only conflict that needs to be resolved by

13

th .£ Court is whether the state

1?

Ba \V uruptcy Act.

18
19

20
21

22

r

here may be constitutional questions surrounding,

statute conflicts with the

: 'rn not asking ;h:,s Court to reach any constitutional

decisions in this case.
Q

Do you think you cpuld prevail in this case

without overruling Kesier as far as Mrs. Persz is concerned?
A

As far as Mrs. Perez is concerned, I believe that

23

this Court can very well distinguish the Kesier case on the ba­

24

sis that the Kesier case, as stated in the opinion by Mr. Justice

25

Frankfurter, the state statute has for the purpose to determine

12

1

2

i -responsible driving and that purpose is absent as far as
Mr i, Peres is concerned—

3

Q

And that—-

4

A

She is in that case not a negligent driver,

5

Q

What basis, -;hen , would there be for us

6
?

8

to set

as hie the Judgement as to Mrs. Perez? the state judgement?

A

I*m not asking this Court

set aside a state

juigement. The state judgement is perfe stly valid,

9

O

No, I mean the license*

10

A

Becuase Mrs. Peres, having gone through bank­

11
12

ruptcy, the judgement i:s duly discharged in bankruptcy.
Q

No, but this presupposes

that this Court is

13

go .ng to overrule Kesler. I ’m asking yeu if Kesler still remains

14

on the bool.s, do you think you have a claim as far as Mrs.

15

Pe :ez is c< ncerned, on the iheory that the rational^ of Kesler

18

diin't reach the one circumstance that this Mrs. Peres was.

17
!3
19

20
21

A

Yes, X believe that this

Court can, because the

rationale of Kesler does not cover persons such as Mrs. Perez—
Q

What ground would that 1 e on? Would that be

on a constitutional approach?
A

No, that would only— the same approach under th

22

the Bankruptcy Act and the supremacy clause. As to Mrs.Perea

23

there was a clear conflict between the state statute requiring

24

that every person against whom a judgement is rendered to sur­

25

render their license, and the Federal Bankruptcy Act. The clear-

13

1

coi flict

2

has emerged.
And as to the rationalein Kesler as pertaining to

3

the negligent driver, Mrs. Feres must have the cloak of pro­

4

tection of the Federal Bankruptcy Act.

5

C

Nov/ Mr. Ching, you are raising a constitutional

6

question, then, to wit, you5re basing your case on the supremacy

7

clc use?

e

A

9

C

Exactly»
Well, now, you do not mention due process, or

10

eqi al protection, or bill of attainder arguments which are con­

11

tain 3d in the amicus briefs.

12

A

No, it is not necessary :o reach these arguments

13

because as I said before, if Emma Peres had not gone through

14

bankruptcy, these issues would have bee i raised.

15

E it since she has gone throngi bankruptcy, the only

16

iss U3 left is whether the Bankruptcy Ac: gives her that certain

17

pre taction.

18

Q

19

A

Are you abandoning those issues?
I am not abandoning these issues. These issues

20

were not decided by the lower Court. Th jseissues would require

21

a Three Judge Court at least

22

existing, and if these issues were to b:a decided I believe at

23

least under existing case law, we would have to remand the

24

case in the Court to convene a Three Judge Court.

25

where ;he case law is now

And I donst think that is necessary because the sa14

I

primacy clause as we know under Swift Ind Company vs. Wickham

2

dots not need a Three Judge Court and s One Judge Court has

3

-

properly decided that issue.

4

V

Well ..independent

;>£ the bankruptcy discharge,,

5

do ^ou think you have no claim by reascn of the state of Ari­

6

zona cancelling her license for conduct in which she had no

7

direct involvement?

3

I,

Yes, I believe the statute would he unconstitu­

0

tional aver, if Mrs. Peres hcd no:, gone through bankruptcy, but.

10

once s.ie hc.d gone through bankruptcy she had the added protec­

11

tion of the Bankruptcy Act.

12

C

Well, I think—

13

A

And if they reason that statute may be uncon-

14

sti tutlonal, if she had ne t gone througi bankruptcy it would be

15

more than enough to show that that statute violated the Bank-

■

■1

!S

rujtcy Act and thus the supremacy clansj.
Q

17

Well, I go back to Mr. J istice Blackmans question.

18

Arc

19

problem, Arizona cannot constitutionali?' do this to her? To the

20

wife.

21

you abandoning any claim that, apart from the bankruptcy

A

I'm not abandoning the claims, I'm just fearful

22

that jurisdictional^ this court cannot

reach these constitutional

23

issues in that a Three Judge Court was not convened and there­

24

fore these issues were not properly brought before this Court.

25

But the One Judge Court did'

rule on the bankruptcy issue and

1

th 33'efore this Court can properly adjuc icafce a Bankruptcy Act

2

cl aim.

3

o

4

al problem.. don't you?

5

A

That's right

6

O

Otherwise you'd have to go back and start all

7

over again.

8

A

3

Well you have to do thai under the jurisdiction­

Which we don;t think is necessary because the

basis of the act is the argument that ve are asserting.
U

10

you accept^ :.n other woids, for your argument

1!

th 3

preiu.se of the Three Judge Court, the Court of Appeals.

12

Bo d. of them, that these other constitutional questions are

13

in substantial and therefore not sufficient to require a Three

14

Ju ic e Sour .
A

15

I don't accept these stetements, however, I

16

th Li.k it is unnecessary to ::each these issues. The Court should

17

li ait itse f to resolving the issues, 1 har is the issue before

18

th

13

having resolved the Bankruptcy Act issie, it is unnecessaxy

20

thereafter to reach a constitutional—

21

.3

Court : n the Bankruptcy Act clamm i s the issue, and once

Q

Putting Mr, Justice Blac kmuns question in a

22

different way, is what I found implicit in it. Suppose you don't

23

prevail on your supremacy clause; then are you arguing here—

24

are you abandoning or are you still maintaining' the due pro­

25

cess or equal protection?

16

A

1

1 will say as a secondary line of defense 1

2

would say that this Court can properly consider the constitution' •

3

al issue as substantial and remand the case to the lower court

4

or a Three Judge Court for---if this Court deems necessary,

S

Q

It would have to go back?

@

A

This is up to this Court,

7

Q

Now that takes care of Emma Peras,, but in order

8

for you to prevail with respect to Adolfo it would be necessary

9

for yout to persuade this Court to overrule Kesler, is that

10

correct?

11

A

Exactly, and I propose to do so.

12

In addition to what I pointed oilfc as to the criminal

13

sanctions, vis: a vis the financial responsibility in my argu­

14

ment that the statute does not really protect the public to

IS

insure that safe drivers drive on the public highways, I think

16

one qhestion which a lot of

people have in mind is this,

You know we can't allow these people to drive, get in­

17
18

to an accident, wipe out the judgement by bankruptcy and <Srive

19

again.

20
21

22
23
24
2S

And what's going to prevent them from doing this over
and over again?
The answer of course, is that it wouldn’t happen over
and over again, because the Arizona statute also provides that
in order for Adolfo Perez to get his license again, not only
must he pay the debt but he must also show that he has insurance

17

i

for the future ,

z

And the Perez8 ara more than willing to obtain in­

3

surance for the future, and therefore if allowed to drive,

4

will be actually more financially responsible than some of the

5

drivers on the streets and highways in Arizona, who have no

6

insurance.

7

Another thing we must demonstrate, that the statute

8

is not fox* the purpose of public safety, X8d like to quote the

9

Arizona supremme Coihht decision in Schecter v. Killings worth.

10

And this decision was cited both by myself and my opponent,

11

and the Arizona Court in that case same out in interpreting the

13

Financial Responsibility. Act, of Arizona, saying that the

13

state statute does not have, fox* its primary purpose, the

14

purpose of public safety.

IS
18
17
18
19
20
21

23
23

24
25

The Arizona Court said the Financial Responsibility
Act has, for its

purpose the principal purpose, the protection

of the- public using the highways, of financial hardship which
may result from the use of automobiles by financially irres­
ponsible persons.
It accomplishes the objective by requiring proof of
financial responsibility of those involved in an accident, either
by showing of insurahce that covers the accident or by requir­
ing a bond, or deposit of cash or security. It may, as inciden­
tal purpose and effect, because of the threat of loss of driving
rights fallowing an uninsured accident, one, encourage operators
18

?

of motor vehicles to obtain liability insurance , and two , to

2

encourage drivers to drive more carefully.

3

Because the uninsured motorist can avoid the adverse

4

effect of the statute , without obtaining insurance, and with­

5

out improving his driving skills, we cannot consider either

6

the encouragement to obtain insurance or the improvement of

1

safety conditions on the highways to be the primary objectise

8

of this law.

9

And this point was admitted by the Respondents in

10

ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. SCHLOSSER, ESQ.

3

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

. 4

MR® SCHLOSSER? Mr» Chief Justice—

5
0

Thank you, Mr» Ching, Mr, Schlosser?

Q

By the way, Mr» Ching, I think you haw about—

we8II make that a minute, Mr» Ching.

7

A

8

I might first state that, as the Court is well

9

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
aware,

there have been two Womens Mb groups that have filed amicus

10

curaie in this particular action. I did not respond to the am­

11

icus curaie in ray answering brief, for the simple reason that

12

the notification concerning the granting of the original amicus

13

curaie brief was not .resieved until my brief was in preparation

14

on its way to the printers.
Notification as to the second one of which I feel

15
IS

a response, a written response, definitely is more deserving,

i7

did not reach my office until January 13, this year.
For that reason, I will attempt to cover those beiefs

18

m

in oral argument, especially the one from 'the Organization lo­

20

cated in Tucson, Arizona, and would request that .if the Court

21

deem necessary as based on different citations which I will

22

utilise in

23

to fiile either additional authorities, and/or maybe a short an­

24

swerings brief directed towards the amicus curaie briefs.

25

oral argument that they might see fit to grant me

I would like first to briefly, actually devote a much
22

!

smaller portion of ray argument to the overall issue as challenged

2

concerning whether or not to overrule Easier and Reitz, and

3

reserve a primary portion of my argument, or rather of the la­

4

tter part of the argument go into the issue concerning Emma ,

5

which is by far the more novel and interesting possibility here»

6

Now as Mr, Ching has pointed out in his--—and 1 think

7

has stated in both briefs that various lip service has been

8

given to the statute which is challenged here, if we take the

9

statute which is challenged here, has been enacted at least at

10

one time in 45 or more of O'ur states .

11

This is based on the Uniform Act of local state ad­

12

options, She public purposes as justifying such statutes have

13

been enumerated as follows s

14

One, a deterrent to unsafe driving.

15

Two, a vary nebulous, to protect others using the

16
17

highways.
Three, and as mentioned most specifically bp Arizona

18

to keep persons who may be injured by the financially irres­

19

ponsible youths utilizing the highways off of our welfare rials„

20

And four, mention has been made to encourage insurance,

21

Arizona does, can at least state that in their estim­

22

ation, the primary purpose ©f this particular statute in the

23

Arosona Supreme Courts estimation when they wrote the Schester

24

case, was to keep persons who may be injured by the financially

25

irresponsible off the wolfate rolls.
23

1

Gentlemen, 1 don't think that whether Arixona states

2

that -they also did mention the incidental purposes, I don't

3

think that Arizona is placing its emphasise, as far as it. was

4

concerned^ on that particular element or alleged public purposee

S

in any way should govern whether or not this statute is held

6

constitutional or unconstitutional or violative or unviolative

7

of the supremacy clause.

3
9

The reason why I say that is this is the challenge
portion of this statute in this case; all but verbatim the stat­

fO

ute

11

challenged in Hosier, becuase Arizona says for various puropes

12

we happen to think this one is the more valid; is no reason

13

for this Court to feel that we5re talking about a different

U

statute—

15

which was challenged in Reitz and the statute which was

Q

Well; Mr. Schlosser, as I read that opinion that

16

it's the more valid, am I right fehat in effect what your Court

17

said was that the primary, I think the word primary—

IS

A

The primary. I understand.

19

Q

—was financial inorder to keep, as you said,

20

victims off the waifat® rolls, and the others were only inciden­

2!

tal. Now are you suggesting 'that that has no significance for

22

us in the constitutional question?

23
24
25

A

I8m suggesting that we are talking about thes

same statute. I'm suggesting—
Q

Well, no, as I understand it, we're talking about

i

t

a statute , either identically or similarly phrased , as to which

2

however*, your Supreme Court has given a gloss-, not given in the

3

statute involved in the Kesler case - Is that right?

4

A

I would have to agree with that»

S

G

And you think that nevertheless has no sig­

6

nificance for us on the constitutional question»
©

7

I do .feel that if you feel the statutes are sub­

8

stantially the same for the purposes of judging the supremacy

9

argument that Arizona is classifying one as primary and others

10

as incidental should be binding upon this Court.
Q

II

I’m a little dense, but I don't quite see the

12

connection between this statute and keeping people off the wel­

13

fare rolls, just as a matter of relevant connection.. This1»*»

14

if the person in Arizona is in an accident, and there's a judge­

15

ment against him that remains unpaid,, he has to give up his

16

license„ he can’t drive» That’s what the statute says,, isn't

17

it?

18

A

Yes.

19

G

And what does that have to do withthe welfare

20

rolls? I think that discharging the bankruptcy would mmore likely

21

keep him off the welfare rolls»

22

A

May I point out to the Court that in the Schecter

23

case, as I recall, the particular suspension which was discussed

24

there, was what the prejudgement suspension, the suspension

25

which is prior to any judgement —- where a determination is
25

1

made upon the reasonable possibility of judgement by the direc­

2

tor of the financial responsibilities section with a provision

3

for appeal from his determination wherein he also sets a bond

4

and the instant case, deals with a past-judgemtne suspension

5

where the liability issues and so forth have been cleared.

6

Now if that provides a distinction» I'm not certain,

7

other than that the bond is there» I would tend fco agree with

8

this Court concerning the primary purpose of the statute

©

concerned as opposed to the Arizona Court.

10

Q

Would you explain to me what it really has to

II

do fe'th the welfare, presence on 'the welfare rolls , or not,

!2

of anybody?

13

H CInterrupting) Yes,

I'm confused, too, as Justice

14

Stewart is. I thought someone? had been referring to the victims

Not the driver of thecar.

A

No it's the victim.

Q

It’s the uncompenstaed

A

Yes. That is—

Q

22

That’s my understanding of the decision.

victim.

But by hypothesis, the victim has already been

victimised. He's been hit by a negligent driver. And injured,
i

efc cetera! So for property loss.- Mow then, so he's already been

24

victimized—

25

A

Yes.
26

Q

I

By a man who can’t pay a judgement,, by hypothe­

2

sis. And so what does it matter what you do with that man who

3

can’t pay the judgement with respect to whether somebody goes

4

on the welfare rolls?

5

Q

{Immediate} I suppose your theory is, isn’t it,

8

-that if he’s seriously hurt, and can’t work,,, he may become an

1

object of'welfare, —

3

A

That is true, but——

9

Q

Yes, but by hypothesis a judgement for debtor

10

has hit this person. So therefore his injuries cannot ha com­

11

pensated. Mow whether or not the victim goes on the welfare

12

rolls hardly has anything to do- with what you do to that judge­

23

© ,

That*s the allegation of the Petitioner, yes.

24

Q

Well, that’s the fact in this case, as it comes

25

to us.

2?

i

A

Well I have to dispute with the facts if you're

2

basing them on -the Ninth Circuit opinion, also. Your Honor,

3

which 1 will cover \ in the Emma portion of my oral argument.

4

Q

Very well. I didn't mean to throw you off, but

5

1 just don't, myself, see the connection between this to any

0

possible, very rational or vary relevant connection between

7

this statute ahd who goes on the welfare rolls.

8
9

A

Well, might I' say briefly in answer to that, and

I doubt that it will satisfy you, I*m not so sure I'm satisfied

!0

with the Arizona explanation. I might say, Kesler was talking

1?

about a prejudgement situation where they were trying to ex­

12

tract a bond.

13

Number two, it may not be every situation where you

14

have a person who is rmpecuneous, or indigent, who is the per­

15

son subjected. You do have stubborn people who do maybe refuse

W

to get insurance and refuse to really protect themselves as they

17

shouM, but who are not necessarily ones who are indigent.

18

19

Q

I suppose the Arizona legislature is feeling the

generality of people, not those who will be judgement proof.

20

A

2!

§

Well—

u
And they believe, at least, that this kin§ of a

22

statute, holding a cloak of cancellation—will lead in most

23

cases to the satisfaction of a judgement.

24

A

3>--

25

Q

Isn't that a rational fchesry?
20

1

A

That is a rational theory,* but. I'm not so certain

2

of the wisdom of it. 1 might point out that the Congress has

3

enacted some of the legislation for the District o£ Columbia as

4

well.
As to the theory which you propose as being rational

5
©

theory* I wok£d definitely agree that that is probably one of

1

their motives* but that whether or not it is effective or not

8

is something of a speculation*

9

Now* if a*

1 might say that one of the valid

10

purposes which has been mentioned but never discussed in any

11

full degree in any of the cas&s I*ve read is to encourage the

12

obtaining of insurance or the posting of surety bonds.
These, as in Arizona and in many states, which don't

13
14

have compulsory insurance* rental agencies, persons who contract

15

for hire, and so

16

in a different class because of their inordinate and use of ‘tine

17

highway looking toward direct pieuniary gain.

are so often required to do and treated

1 might say that a complete reversal or detraction of

18
19

theirights Kesler position* I think would leave us in a position

20

where* as in a practical matter* the marginal owner wow&S maybe

21

be financially ahead to not purchase insurance and save a few

22

dollars aside to pay for his bankruprcy discharge* and as long

23
24
25

as heBs

off

does not have an accident for another six years

he's safe again.
Now 1 would like to direct the balance of ray comment

29

1

and my time* X believe* to* with the execpfeion of a very sh&sry

z

summary, to the Emma Peres situation.
Thusfar we9v® had three briefs filed* as far as I'm

3
4

concerned*

5

of Appeals that is entirely in error concerning lav/* and facts,

6

concerning Emma Peres. There are certain aspects and basis doc­

7

trines of community law and tort liability law in Arizona that

3

best be explained.

9

and an ©pinion written by the Ninth Circuit Court

The first one is that* number one* in Arizona* mere

m

ownership of a vehicle is not grounds forilability against the

ii

owner by a borrower negligently driving the same.

m

Secondly* in Arizona it is not necessary for the wife

13

to be a party to a judgement vs the husband for driving of the

14

community vehicle. The case of Bristol v. Moser* which is in

15

99 Pacific Second 706* in the case of First National Bank v.

16

Rees* which is in 234 Pacific* 556* both Arizona cases* held

^7

that a community* let's assume Mr. Peres is on a community

IB

errand* X will give Mr. Shing that much* although I don't know

19

that that was established in the record or in the appendis.

20

Mr. Perea is driving the community vehicle on a com­

21

munity errand* Nevertheless* pursuant to Emmas contention she

22

had nothing to do with the accident* other than that whe was

23

mis fortunate enough to be married to an uninsured* non-negligent

24

community property husband, negligently drining her community

as

property vehicle.

30

1

Q

Suppose Mrs., Peres was in London, same result?

2;

A

Yes» Mrs„ Peres confessed judgement» If she is

3

to be believed in her allegations concerning no liability at

4

all, confessed a judgement which the law could not have imposed

3

upon her, had she chosen, or had her lawyer advised her to con­

6

test it.

7

In the first National Bank ?, Rees, or the Bristol

3

case, and I can't recall which, one ©£ them says the husband

9

is the only indispendible party to such a judgement,, The other

10

one vacated a judgement vs. the wife and husband, on a community

11

obligaition.

12

The case of Mortensen v. Knight, in Arizona deals

13

with the whether or not parties are inversly responsible for

U

their spouse6 negligent operation of a community vehicle.

15

In Mortensen v. Knight, the wife was the negligent

16

driver. The husband who had liability was imposed against the

17

husband. On the theory of ownership? No.

18

Liability was imposed against the husband for the

19

following reason. He was a co-owner because it was a community

20

vehicle, yes, but the Court said that isn't enough. He is impose»

Zt

with liability because Arizona makes him the exclusive agent and

22

manager of the community, Thai: was a community vehicle. He had

23

a right to control his wife.

24

Conversly, as pointed out in all these briefs, filed

25

by the amicus curaie Womens Lib group, conversly, by that very

31

1

own Ari sona opinion, Mrs. Peres had no right to control what:

2

Mr. Peres did, because she has no right to control the utilizati< >n

3

of community property contrary to her husbands wishes and con­

4

sequently could hot have been held liable.

5

The law imposes a suspension vs. persons who are not

6

owners, or not drivers, or not ones who .maintain vehicles. The

7

suspension is imposes against persons kho are adjudged debtors

8

as a result of that type of relationship..

9

That does not presuppose-that someone who, has that

10

type of relationship to, a vehicle is going to be a judgement

11

debtor. And I maintain, bas£d on fcha decisions cited, that—

12

Mortensen v, Knight, I*m sorry, is 305 Pacific Second 463, and

13

Petersen v. Feldman, dealing-with mere ownership is not suf-

14

ficient to impose liability is 436 Pacific Second 169, once

15

again both Arizona Cases.

16
17

!8

Q

Those are all cited in your brief, are they

A

Mo they*re not, Your Honor, these are primarily

not?

19

in response to the argument which is set out in the amicus

20

euraie brief from Tucson.

21
22
23

24
25

Q

You’re going to give us that, though, are you

goin§ to supplement?
A

I would like the Court to grant leaver to sup-

plememt my brief either by just giving yau an official list
of these authorities which I cite in my opinion, or a brief

32

i

supplemental answering brief in response fcfe the amicus curaie f

2

whichever the Court please»

3

Q

You may just submit the list, if that suits

3

A

Thank you. I appreciate that.

6

So basically my contention is Emma Perez confessed

4

you»

1

judgement on bad advice, when had she not confessed judgement

8

she could have recieved summary judgement if she could have

9

established the facts which she asks this Court to tely on.

10

If
12

Q

Is there any procedure in the state of Arizona

for getting this corrected?
A

I regret to say that if this were a prejudgement

13

situation, you have a review. The post judgement suspension re-

14

lys on the due process procedures which are afforded in your

15

tortious action tribunal. Consequently, by confessing judgement

1©

and then not enteeressg an appeal, there is no forum now, and the

17

judgement is a judgement. To that extent.

18

Q

Mr. Schlosser, could you, would you say that

19

Arizona could give a cause of action against Mr* and Mrs. Perea

20

for the debt?

21

on the highways?

In order to protect those people who are injured

22

A

I'm not certain I followed your question, sir*

23

Q

Well let's assume Mr* Peres has an accident and

24
25

he hurts somebody, and he gets sued and he has a debt.
A

Yes, sir.
33

1

Q

And there's a judgement against him»

z

A

Yes, sir»

3

Q

And he takes bankruptcy,

4

A

Yes, sir.

5

Q

Could Arizona nevertheless furnish the injured

6

person with a cause of action against Mr. and Mrs. Peres?

7

A

No—

Q

Q

For the debt?

9

A

No, I don't believe so, Your Honor, I believe

to

that Arizona would certainly feel bound by the Kesler decision

n

which makes the—

12

Q

Do you think for this very same purpose, namely

13

of compensating the injured person, Arizona may take away the

14

drivers license?
A

15
16

I would have to say my answer to that would

have to be in the affirmative, yes,
Q

And if the answer is bo, why then you're in

19

6

Yes „

20

Q

Now Mr, Ching told us that it was the practice

17
18

trouble.

2!

in Arixona, in a situation such as is alleged here, i.e. per­

22

sonal injuries caused by the sole negligence of the husband

23

driving a car registered in his naras that is community property.

24

He told us that it is the practice in Arizona to get a judge­

25

ment against husband and wife, because, assume the wife is a

34

I

wage esraer, half of her wages, 1 guess, belong to the husband

z

and could be levied against by the judgement creditor, is that

3

right?

4
5

A

1 would say that that is the prevailing practice.

However, if—

6

Q

You say that is the prevailing practice?

7

A

Yes, but that does not alter what is the law

3

in Arizona, and there is one other factor that entertains the

9

subject. When you sue both husband and wife and get a judgeEient

10

against both husband and wife, if yon have a negligent husband

!1

driving, you sue him, excuse me, if you sue him you have a

12

judgement vs-the community if he's on a community errand, and

13

you have a judgemtne vs. his separate property.

14

If you joined the wife, not only is she subjecting

15

her community but there's a very good argument even if they

18

want to characterise it "husband and wife” after their judge­

17

ment heading, that you've also got her separate property too.

18

For something that should not in any way be affected

19

as long as she was not negligent, did not have any power to

20

control the operation.

21

Q

VJhat you're saying here is that if the allegation;;

22

are correct, the judgement against her was completely unjus­

23

tified under Arizona law?

24
25

A

That;s right, and they relied on tbad attorneys

advice in the lower court.
35

1

The same advice which was to confess judgement and

2

go through bankruptcy.

3

Q

Where do you think that all brings this out?

4

A

It brings us to a situation, Your Honor, where

5

as far as relief for Mrs. PeresP there's one factor which is

6

later on in ray notes but I might mention ifc , this may not

7

be justice

8

who confess liability to actions they're not liable for»

9

,,

but I don't know what the lav.? can do about people

And then let their appeal time ride. Now this is a

10

sanction which they relied on, they relied on an attorney who

11

gave them adyi.ee contrary to a statute which at least at the

12

time of his advice had been held constitutional or a like

13

counterpart had*

14

I don't know what advice to offer them other than the

IS

fact that if the procedure set out in error as 28 11 65 had

16

never been utilised in this ease, which is a method for these

17

people to have their license returned, and I would call the

18

Courts attention to that. Arizona is unique, I think, as eompac&e

IS

to other states which have this, hecuase in reviewing some of

20

the other states which have statutes bases on the Uniform Safety

21

Responsibility Act, Arizona is one of the few that in working

22

the party in interest?

10

A

Once the bankruptcy has gone through, who is

The party in interest, pursuant to the Arizona

11

statute, and I would be less than candid 'if 1 told you different

12

were still the victims of the accident.

13

Q

So bankruptcy wouldn't help at all.

14

A

Bankruptcy merely precludes those people from

15

Utilising any technical aspects in collecting that judgement.

16

Wo garnishments or executions.

17

Q

But they could object to their

license.

18

A

All they can do is, different than Utah, in

19

Utah they can -tigated the action, in Arizona, they can relieve

20

the party, or a court, can relieve the party over their objection

21

if the court orders them to pay installment payments in his

discretion, and they keep up their installment payments.

Q

Without the license provision the judgement debt­

fight given to a judgement

4

debtor in a bankruptcy preceding. The right to keep me from

5

getting my license,

S

A

Oh, the creditor, Your Honor,

7

Q

Yea, 1 meant to say—

3

A

He doesn81 have the right to keep you fro® get­

SO

with you, he has the right to allow you off the hook, as opposed

n

to, he doesn’t invoke it.

12
13

I may be playing a word game with you, I’m afraid
possibly I am.

14

QM

Maybe we both are.

15

A

I might explain now to the Court that we have,

16

that Mr. Ching has admitted that you can require compulsory

17

insurance. He8s also, X would feel by this same admission, his

13

objection was to the creditor. The creditors power in the sit­

19

uation. What if we had a statute in Arizona which said you <$et

20

in an accident and yon don’t tell us that you had insurance ox'

2!

some other funds deposited on the date of that acciddnt, you lose

22

you® license automatically.

23
24
25

Nothing about creditors, nothing about bankruptcy, or
anything else.
Q

Well the creditor is not taking any action here,

38

I

z

it’s only state action we're concerned with,
A

isn't it?

That's true, the creditor does have power to

3

relieve, also the superior court does, Your Honor, based on

4

conditional payments which either the creditor could waive if

5

he wanted to, we can't expect that, it's impractical, but they

6

could relieve on the installment plan. We're talking about—-

1

7

They also have the power where you have a creditor

8

who's overbearing, the superior court does have the power to

9

— set monthly payments in his discretion»

10

I merely point out to the Court the admissions con­

11

cerning insurance as a compulsory prerequisite and so forth and

12

once again I still have to admit that I am somewhat baffled as

13

are the Respondents who I represent, how a person can admit that

14

this could be required as a precondition to issuance of a lic­

IS

ense yet a leses severe restriction is unconstitutional.

16

17

NOW—

Q

Well only because of the existence of the BankI

18

rupfccy Act, and beeat&se of the supremacy plause. Which wouldn't

19

touch the requirement of insurance.

20

A

That's true, that's what l*sm referring to.

2!

Q

Their argument is based upon the Bankruptcy

22

power of Congress and the legislation that Congress has enacted

23

under that power being supreme to the laws of Arizona. It's

24

not based„ at the moment at least on any concepts of due pro­

ZS

cess or equal protection. That's the reason for the difference,

%

isn't it?

2

A

Yes«

3

Q

The bankruptcy legislation wouldn't ha%ye anything

4

to do with your compulsory insurance section,iis that correct?

5

A

Yes.

6

I might point out on the brief from- the womans cen­

7

ter in Los Angeles, on&~o£ the amicus curaie briefs-. In brief

3

response to that, once again they're relying on the fact, which

9

was pointed out in the Ninth Circuit Court erroneously by

10

II
12
13
U

15

Emma Perea, an established fact that was non negligent.
Only Mr. Shings assertion concerning the complaint
d© we know that she is non negligent. Not-—,
There are innumerable

factual situations where this

could have been imposed.
Q

And you say that everyone is foreclosed from

IS

challenging that by reason of 'idle entry of the judgement by

17

confession whether with good or bad advice.

18

A

1 would think so.

19

Q

They can’t go behind the judgement.

20

A

I would think so. That would b© my position,

21

22

right or wrong as to these facts.
Secondly, the Court of Appeals did rely on a case

23

by the name of Donado v. Fishbern, to say the wife is bound to

24

join in this judgement.

25

Gentlemen I have reread Donado v. Fishbern, I don't
40

1

know where Court, o£ Appeals came to that conclusion. It's

2

.

certainly not in thecase.

3

All it talks about is executing vs, the community,

4

based on the judgement. There®s no discussion in there what­

5

soever concerning whether or

6

have to be any discussion concerning proper-

7

pensible parties in a community property situation,

B

Q

not a v/ife has to be or does not
necessary indis-

Well, as Mr, Justice Harlan asked you earlier,

9

where does all this lead us with respect to the issue in this

10

case# with respect to Emma Perea, The fact is that she is now

1!

a judgement creditor, rightly or wrongly, erroneously or cor­

12

rectly under Ard-sona law, she is one, and a judgement debtor,

13

I beg your pardon, a judgement debtor.

14

And now her claim is that becuas of her discharge,

IS

and because of the- effect of the bankruptcy proceedings, her

IS

liability to the judgement creditor is now discharged, as a

17

matter of the supremacy of federal law,

18

Now wouldn't that argument ba just as good or bad,

19

just as sound oi unsound whether or not the original judgement

20

against her was judtieied or unjustified?
A

Ywa, if you're talking about the supremacy

23

Q

Yes.

24

A

Definitely.

25

Q

Well that, 1 gather, is what Mr. Ching is talking

2

about
A

Yes, but. wa do have other contentions in the

3

various other briefs and we also have some erroneous conclusions

4

in the Ninth Circuit brief which I did want to make sure was

5

clarified as to my position.

S

Yes, I would agree. X personally tMnk, for instan.ce

7

Mr. Shing mentioned that he’s going, first his briefs it talks

8

about the Pesres’ and he says inaaddifelon here is Emma, and then

9

he says Emma is innocent -therefore X personally think innocent,

10

not innocent, owner, driver, what have you, if it violates the

11

supremacy clause because the suspension isn’t discharged it

12

doesn't make any difference %fhethez* she's innocent or if she's

13

guilty, or if it prooves negligence, because of course that can

14

be discharged.

15

Q

Right.

16

A

Wilful and ---, excuse me.

17

Q

Right.

18

A

But the distinction and relationship X dont think

19

has any validity if supremacy is what we’re talking about.

20

Q

Right.

21

A

My time is up, X want to thank you.

Q

Thank you, Mr. Sohlosser. Wafll give you a little

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY B. CHXNG, ESQ.

1
2

OH BEHALF OB PETITIONERS

MR. CHXNG: Mr. Chief Justice, I would rebut Mr.

4

Schlossers argument as to ownership being a basis for the judge­

3

ment. Under the statute defining

6

Responsibility Act —. Judgement—should become final except

7

by court as deriving out of the ownership, maintenance or use

8

of a vehicle.

judgement in the Financial

That's ownership very much part of the judgement. As

9
10

to welfare, I would say to the court that there’s more likli-

11

hood that a judgement debtor would go on welfare than a judge­

12

ment creditor. The creditor has insurance—
Q

13
14

How can you categorise that, Mr. Ching, if it

depends on the economic status of the particular victim?

13

A

Exactly.

IS

0

You really can’t generalise about people who get

17

hit by automobiles, can you?
A

18

No, but I’m saying that-—"providing for the

19

uninsured motorist provision for example and the insurance com­

20

pany pay off to the victims and that in the Schecter case the

2!

Court took about 76% of the motorist being insured and there­

fore 2 out of 4 vietiiss most likely have insurance. Therefore

23

those creditors pursuing the deptors 2 out of 4 are insurance
