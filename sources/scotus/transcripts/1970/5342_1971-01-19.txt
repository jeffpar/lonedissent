ARGUMENT OF ALBERT J. DATE, ESQ.

OH BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

MR. DATEs Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
the Coutt o

50

The issue here is whether or not travel in interstate

11

commerce is necessary for guilt, whether or not re-travel in

12

interstate commerce is necessary for guilt under 18 United

13

States Code 1952, known as the Travel Actr is supplied by the

14

fact that the gambling players , or customers cross a state line,

IS

The Petitioners here are James Mintford Rewis—

16

Q

Mr. Data.

17

A

Yes, sir.

18

Q

You stated the issue c and as you understand it

19

and submit it to the Court today , is it purely a question of '

20

statutory construction., or are there any constitutional ques­

21

tions?

22

*A

I believe it's purelystatutory

23

Q

You don’t question the power"?

24
25

the commerce laws?
A

Hot in that—

4

construction.
of the Coggress undes:

1

Q

“«--the statute that could have made travel by

2

the gamblers sufficient to make your clients guilty of a fed­

3

eral criminal offense?

4

A

This is not involved here.. Your Honor„ I'm

5

a%?are of the fact that Congress has just recently passed such

6

a statute—

7

Q

Well? in other words if we disagree

with you

8

as to the statutory constructions, it could he involved. We could

9

say yes ? the statute was we read it does mean that the travel

10

by the players from Georgia into Florida is sufficient to make

11

your clients guilty of an offense under, the statute as it's

12

written,

13

. .
Then there it becomes a question, well did Congress

14

have the constititutional power under the commerce clause to

15

do so?

Q

•

We don't go that far—
v
You just rest your argument osi the words of the

statute,

A

Yes, Your Honor,

Q

Is that correct?

22

’

A

Yes, Your Honor,

Q

Plus—
*■

?

23
24
25

;

A

*

I might point out; tangentially that in the re­

cently passed act, Congress did declare that gambling was a

5

f

matter of interstate commerce per se. That it affected inter-

2

state commerce and attempted to regulate,

S

I submit, and this is not in the briefs, nobody had

4

raided it, that that might even be additional factors to

S

consider a comparison with that Statute and the Travel Act is

6

what Congress could have done if it had wanted to.

7

Q

Well you assume, in any event, your argument is

8

based 'exclusively on the language of the statute and its legis­

9

lative history?

10

A

Yes, Your Honor.

I?

Q

Merely a statutory argument.

12

A

Yes, Your Honor.

13

The Petitioners, Jaslas Rewis and Mery Will aims were

14

taken in the middle district of Florida of the crime involved

15

in., the violation of 18 United States Code 1952, known as

16

the Travel Act.That is, of traveling and causing travel in inter»

17

state commerce with intent to promote, manage, establish, carry

18

on and to facilitate the promotion, management establishment,

IS

and carrying on ©f a gambling activity.

20

Wow the gambling activity involved was a lottery, :

2!

known as "Cuba”. And in this particular case, Cuba is called

22

Cuba because at that time the winning number was picked through

23

the national lottery in Cuba. It was picked around 2;00 p.m.

24

on Saturday afternoon each week, and the people in the state

*

25

■

e

of Florida who were actually violating the laws of the state of

6

1

Florida in running this Cuba activity would wait and jjet the

z

winning number from Cuba and that, of course, would determine

3

the winning number of everybody who had played»

4

Now this lottery, so far as this case is concerned,

S

was operated from the home of Mary Williams, at & small com­

Q

munity between Jacksonville, Florida and

7

Florida, known as Yuiee»

Fernandina Beach,

8

This horn® is about a half a mile from a highway, US17

9

which led to Georgia» Georgia was about 15 miles north of Yuiee

10

The game was a relatively small game, as was pointed out in

11

the briefs» I believe the take ©n the particular Saturday on

12

which it was raided was about $125, although condeededly, Rewis

13

who was the pick up man or operator of the game had over $1500

14

in his pocket»

IS

But significantly, the winning number fell on a Sat­

16

urday afternoon and most of the players would pick their numbers

17

on Friday night and Saturday morning» Undoubtedly, Many Willaims

18

who was operating a selling establishment there from her home

19

was a seller of the numbers»

20

21

22

Rewis was the central figure who picked up the numbers
each Saturday around noon before the winning number would fall»
Now the issue of the trial has here, was whether ©i
\

23

not travel by some customers who were from Georgia, at least

24

15 miles to the north, invested the operation with tMs travel

25

in interstate commerce required by the Travel Act»

7

I

However, the theory of the government at the trial

2

and the theory in the Appellate Courts is different. At the

3

trial the government contended and the District Judge agreed

4

that the travel of the customers themselves invested this illegal

5

activity with the interstate character necessary for conviction,

6

and the customers themselves, or bettors could be convicted,

7

under the Travel Act.

8

Now after the conviction the Fifth Circuit disagreed

9

with that concept. Originally there were 11 people indicted.

1©

One was Sewis6 wife who was excused because of illness. Four

11

had directed motions for judgement of acquittal granted by the

12

trial judge. Two were acquitted by the jury, and finally two

13

who were convicted, their convictions were reversed by the

14

Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, on the theory that the

15

only evidence against them was that they were the bettors, the

16

customers, and that the Trace 1 Act itself did not proscribe the

17

conduct of the bettor, only the ©peratas of the business enter­

18

prise as defined by the statute itself, subsection B of the stat­

19

ute, Section 1952, describes the unlawful activity as "a busi­

2©

ness enterprise" and a short look at the legislative history of

21

this statute shows without any doubt that the intent of Congress

22

was to proscribe the activities of the business enterprise,

23

and we submit that the reverse is true, that it did not intend

24

t© proscribe the activities of the (bettor.

25

Now the government has not contended otherwise here,

8

!

but the Fifth circuit in reversing as to the two customers af­

E

firmed the conviction as to Rewis and Williams, the last two

3

remaining defendants, on the theory that by placing this game,

4

this lottery within 15 miles of the Georgia border, that they

5

had attracted, sort of an attracted nuisance theory, they had

6

attracted these bettors from the state of Georgia to Florida,

7

and this the interstate character was bestowed on this gambling

8

pperation»

9

10

Q

What would yoy say if the gambling establishment

had been 15 feet inside the1line from Georgia?

11

A

12

Q

13

A

1 would say the same thing, that it did not-—I see,,
---violate the statute» This particular Travel

14

Act, anyhow, now we might get into another area, smother question

IS

of use of interstate facilities, to promote, manage, et cetera,

16

the use of a gambling operation, because as an example, suppose

17

they put up a big billboard right at the border and say"Come

18

on over to Florida and participate in our gambling operation",

19

then there would be some question of interstate facility, but

20

not travel»

21

Q

22

A

23

©

24
25

Wouldn't it be different if they had a sigh—
I don't believe so.
—the other way, saying come in, have fun,

just before yoii leave Florida?
A

If the operators had traveled in interstate com9

1

merce to put that sign up, and they would have had to do that,

a

either themselves or through soma agent, then of course they

3

would be guilty beeuase they are the operators *

4

They are promoting, establishing, maintaining, and

5

carrying on this operation, the exact words the statute used

6

to condemn„

7

But the msre placing of the sign at the border-would

e

not be sufficient® Or placing the game 15 feet from the border

9

would not be sufficient®

10

But here we have 15 miles and the Court of Appeals

ii

said that this attracted the players across the state line and

12

invested the game with the interstate character necessary for

13

conviction®

14

Q

—to what attracted the players,

i5

A

Itlm sorry your Honor, I didn’t—

16

Q

I guess you wouldn’t say that the Court of Appeals

17

is wrong in saying that within 15 miles of the border on those

IS

good roads' that that would have attracted the players®
A

19

I would tend to agree, Your Honor, that it might

20

have had some attraction, although, and we might discuss this at

21

this moment, the government says that the predominant people

22

involved were from Georgia, we submit the record would dhow

23

otherwise, that these people came from Georgia for several

24

reasons.

25

On® of the witnesses was bringing sewing to the Mary

10

1

Williams house, her mother was ill and she would bring sewing

2

back and forth. Other witnesses would come down to Jacksonville

3

to buy- fish to peddle up in Georgia, and stop by the game to

4

bet a number.

5

Q

tod others came down to gamble, right?

6

A

Yes, sir, others came for the specific purpose

7

of gambling. But it wasn’t the predominant travel, this is an

8

example. There were 14 different successive Saturdays involved

9

in the government surveilance of this Mery Williams home. They

10

made a count in the indictment for each one of those Saturdays

11

claiming interstate travel.

12

Wow they joined Mary Williams and Rewis in each of

13

those counts and then they would say that one or more people

14

from Georgia would travel on those particular Saturdays.

15

This is alleged, now, even though the trial judge

16

directed a judgement of acquittal as to 4 of these people,

17

and the jury acquitted 2 on the theory that they weren’t even

18

customers, because at that time the trial judges theory was, and

19

the governments theory was that if they were customers they

20

’were guilty.

21

But on 5 Saturdays they say one person came from Ge©r~

22

gia. On 3 Saturdays they say 2 people came from Georgia. On 4

23

Saturdays they say that 3 people came from Georgia^ and on 2

24

Saturdays they said that 4 people came from Georgia.

25

Q

Didn’t any more people than that come from 15

11

1

down in Florida?

except for—

That's all that the record shows Your Honor*

Q

How many were coming from Florida? I don't

A

A lot» Well* now this is the point» The—-you'd

see—

7

have to see the movies which were introduced at the trial to

8

know this* and for this reason 1 hesitate to take advantage of

9

the government* hut there were a lot of people from Florida»

10

This was not a predominantly Georgia type of operation,

II

and this may become significant in connection with the theory

12

that the government offers for the purpose of the travel»

13

Q

You say there were movies introduced in evidence?

14

A

Yes* Your Honor»

15

®

Of the activity going on around the house. And -

10

I suppose they're in the original record which is loged in the

17

Court * are they?

18

A

Yes* sir» A certain example» They would take the

19

surveilance from 9s00 Saturday moening until Is00 Saturday

20

afternoon* they would then* the FBI testified* they only took

21

movies of those people they thought pertinent feo the inves­

22.

tigation* and this was late in the investigation where they

23

were concentrating on Georgia people»

24
25

On one Saturday 4 hours of surveilance produced 3
minutes of movies. On another Saturday it produced 8 minutes of
12

i

movies, on.the next 9, and on the last , 7 minutes of movies out

2

of over 4 hours of surveilance.

3
4

5
6

Q

What would be your position if the record showed

that 60% of all the people who came there were from Georgia?
A

I would say that it would be do different. Your

Honor, if 100% came from Georgia»

7

Q

Then why emphasise the minimal number, if the

Q

number is irrelevant?

9

A

Becuase simply that the government takes the po™

10

sition that we can expound a new theory here, and in spite of

n

tlie language of the statute which says that the travel must he

12

to promote the game, that the defendants could be guilty if

1.3

you applied a combination of the mail fraud statute and the

14

Mann Act, and say that if the defendants reasonably expected

15

out of state people to travel to their game for the specific

16

purpose of participating in that gambling operation, then, the

17

government says, we can now, based on this case, hold them

18

fuilfcy of the offense.

19

We submit that that would be contrary to the intent

2©

of Congress from a simple reading of the statute much less a

21

study of the legislative history involved»

22

Q

Mr» Cox, help me out in one respect» I take it

23

the government seeks now and that this Circuit held that the

24

statute has no application to ihe interstate traveler who crosses

25

the state line merely to place a bet»
13

t

A

1 believe that5 s correct.

2

Q

Suppose that this circuit were wrong, const!"

3

fcutionally, and -that the statute—

4

A

5

Q

Does your case go out?

6

A

Yes„ it would.

7

Q

Then"””

Would you mind telling me again as briefly as

8

possible what you understand be 'the difference between your

3

position and the other ones. I don't sjuite get it in the briefs

10

or the argument in this case.

11

A

Our position, if it please the Court, is that

12

travel required by the statute cannot be inputed under any

13

circumstances by the simple travel of a customer to a gambling

14

game.
The government maintains that it can be imputed to the

15
16

gambling game if the operator could reasonably foresee that a

17

bettor would come to the game and cross state lines in doing

18

so.

19

And they carry it further. A bettor would do so for

20

the specific purpose of gambling in that game. Mow the reason

21

for that limitation is this. Otherwise„ and we submit that even.’-,

22

if that theory is accepted, the whole expanse ©f the Travel Act

23

would be broadened to the point where the FBI and the federal

24

government would be in the minor police court case business.

25

Every——this case simply was a game 15 miles from Geor-

14

1

gia because as the Fifth Circuit said

2

reasonably anticipated that people would come from Georgia to

3

play.

4

the operator should have

But what of the tourist resort, where people are

5

crossing state lines all the time, Miami, Los Angeles, Haw York?

6

Certainly every hotel operator can look at his register and see

1

people come across state lines» Does the back room —-card game

8

come within federal jurisdiction, then?

9

Does the prostituti who entertains a guest knowing

10

that he comes across the state line come within federal juris­

11

diction? The vast number of case increase would be fantastic,

12

to accept the governments theory under these circumstances,

13

Q

Is the governments theory anybody who travels

14

along the highway which happens to cross a state line, mid wants

15

to go to a gambling house subject to jurisdiction of the fed­

16

eral government to try for gambling?

17

A

Not the person who traveled on the highway,

18

but the man who runs the house would be §ubject to federal

ID

jurisdiction. The man who runs the gambling house would then

20

be subject to federal jurisdiction,

21

Q

Is that the only basis for jurisdiction?

22

A

I submit that it is, They have tried to limit

23

it in what we submit is not a very pragmatic way and say the

24

traveler must have traveled for the specific purpose of gambling

25

or participating in the unlawful activity.
15

1

2

Q

Well what would that have to do with the guilt

of the man who owned the gambling house?

3

A

4

And certainly under-—

5

Q

6

I submit that it would not-, Your Honor.

You mean the governments theory is that the

operator of the establishment in this circumstance where he

7 has reason to expect people will come across state lines t©
8

his establishment for the purpose of gambling is himself "travel­

9

ing in interstate commeres”.?

10

A

Yes, Your Honor.

n

Q

12

A

13

Now this attraction theory as limited to the facts

That5s the governments theory?
That8® the governments theory as 1 understand it.

14

of this case,- however, becomes even saore expansive, because

15

hare we have a game that the only attraction is the fact that

16

it's 15 miles from the state line.

17

Q

Well, now—

18

A

Every border town then, automatically comes under

19
20

federal jurisdiction if we accept——
Q

Isn’t the governments theory a little broader

21

than that? I think your response to Justice Brennans question is

22

that 'the statute s'ays whoever travels interstate commerce, in

23

the disjunctive, or foreign, commerce, or uses any facility in

24

interstate commerce. Including the mail—

25

@

Yes o

16

1

q

---with intent to do the following -things.

2

A

That is correct.

3

Q

Doesn't that broaden it a little bit?

4

A

No, Your Honors because in this case there was

5

6

no allegation of use of facilities in interstate commerce.
That was eliminated from this case. The only allegation

7

in the indictment was the travel. Now there was an allegation in

8

the conspiracy count that a violation of Section

9

is carrying gambling paraphernalia, but that was stricken by

10

1953, which

the trial judge because there was no evidence ©f it.

11

12
13

14

Q

Did you not assert here that the government do.es

have the authority t© make gambling a ermine in a state?
A

We do not assert that--“-we do not take a position

15

one way or the other. Your Honor, because as was indicated,

18

there's some new legislation that Congress just passed a month

17

or so ago, which attempts to do that and which has a declared

18

purpose that gambling has an effect on interstate comraerse.

19

I think it would be improper for me t© try to antici­

20

pate a ruling that is certainly going to come under that stat­

21

ute in this case here.

22

Q

Did that legislation pass?

23

A

Yes,

sir.

24

Q

Both

houses?

25

A

Yes,

sir.

17

1

But I might add that

even in that legislation they

2

don’t make all gambling come under federal jurisdiction, only

3

what they consider big games and they define what big games

4

are, there has to be a certain amount of money involved, which

S

doesn’t happen»

6
7

Even under the new act, we wouldn’t be under federal
jurisdiction in this case»

8

Q

Your client is the owner?

9

A

My client is Rewis, was the man who would go

10

by Mary Williams home and gather the m©n@y in and figure out

11

who was entitled to what» The reason 1 dodge Your Honors8 ques­

12

tion slightly is because the record doesn’t really show who

13

the owner is» He is merely a pick up man»

©

14

fa

Ha's kind of a secret»

15

A

Yes, sir»

16

Now the government attempts to bring an agency pre­

^

17

position here under Section—Tit la 18 Section 2B whiesh says that

18

whoever wilfully causes an act to be performed which is directly

19

performed by him and another, could be an a?f£ense againstthe

20

United States

21

as punishable as a principle»

But we submit that once you assume: that the bettor is

22

not a travelr under the statute, then Rewis himself, the oper­

23

ator cannot incur criminality, simply because-—even if he

24

25

caused the bettor to cross the line, becuase that would be
creating a new.offense»

18

i

Mow the government attempts to analogize the Mann

2

Act violation where a woman is inticed into interstate com­

3

merce for the purpose of prostitution,
Q

4

Excuse me * Mr . Oats. I 5ra looking at the Court

5

of Appeals opinion page 57, at the conclusion."We think that

6

the gambler operators of the gambling establishment are re­

1

sponsible under the terms of this statute for the use os inter­

e

state facilities by way of interstate travel, for those whose

9

participation is vital to the suscess of his business.85
Now do you suggest that that addresses itself to an

10
ii

issue not in the case?

12

A

Yes, sir.

13

Q

I gather you would concede, would you, that

14

had your clients in fact been indicted under the using of any

15

facilities, you might not he hare?
A

16

I don't know, Your Honor, 1 think that there it

close question what would the interstate facility foe?

There’s no evidence of travel other than-—

And that you can't construe this statute as

22

Q

That's tight.
Is

there any law of this kind that you know of,

23

federal or relating to gambling in Nevada, about those who go

24

on planes?

25

A

No, Your Honor, the way fcha statute avoids that

20

is it defines the"unlawful activity" as any business enterprise

2

which is unlawful in the state where it occurs» And since

3

gambling is lawful in Nevada, this wouldn't apply*

To touch very briefly, the government seeks to anal­

ogize under the Mann Act and the language ff Congress there was

specifically condemning whoever would persuade, induce, intice,

or coerce a woman to travel in interstate commerce for the

the Court.

17

She issue in this case is whether there is sufficient

evidence to show that Petitioners caused other people not them­

19

selves to travel in interstate commerce

20

their gambling establishment, whether the people who traveled

21

were runners or customers.

intent to promote

The issue as we see it will involve the construction

22
23

of 18 USC 1952 and also 18 USC 2, turns in large part ©S the

24

facts»

25

Now let me just restate some of the salient facts.

24

I

S

Q

!

What do these indictments charge? Which is the

2

offense., the charge, traveling in interstate commerce or using

3

any facility in interstate commerce?
A

4
5

We construe the indictment as charging traveling

in interstate commerce.

©

Q

Not using any facility.

7

A

And causing to travel.

8

Q

Yes. Mot using any facility. You don8t construe

9

the indictment as charging that?

50

A

No.

11

Q

But the Court of Appeals apparently turned the

12

affirmance ©f the conviction under that use of interstate

13

facility„

14

A

1 think the Court ofAppeals read the statute as-

15

construed the statute as meaning that when you travel a car is

18

traveled, that includes the use of interstate facilities.

17

Q

18

A

19

I see.
In other words, I think they use, condider the

term "travel" to embrace the use of interstate facilities.

20

©

In that sense redundant, you mean?

21

A

Right.

22

Q

They charge 'the same offense.

23

A

Right. In other words they consider the Word

24

travel embraces the use of interstate facilities such as inter­

25

state roads.
25

1

Q

Why would Congress have made the distinction?

2

A

well,—

3

Q

-—-using the telephone or something.

4

A

Right, using the telephone. Eight.

5

If you go on the history of the statute, the history

6

shows that use of interstate facilities was added to the bill

1

after it was initially introduced to broaden the bill and to

8

©over—

9
10

Q

Travel would include use, but in some eircum-

stances, but there are others not included'

11

A

Right.

12

Q

—in the problem that it might reach,—

13

A

Right.

14

Q

—is that it?

15

A

That9s correct.

16

Q

I see.

17

A

As 1 recall the initial bill was just a travel

18

bill that went on either one of the committees, either

the

19

Senate or the House committed, added the use of interstate

20

facilities to the bill that was introduced by the Department,

21

of Justice»

22

Q

Mr» Glaser, according to Petitioner, they admit

23

they were running a lottery operation. Am X correct that the

24

only way they could escape being indicted under this statute

25

would be that everybody that drove up with a Georgia license,

26

1

they8d say "hold it”?

2

A

Well, it-—let me just go over fast, if I answer

3

the facts, relate the facts, I think it becomes a little easier

4

for th© Court to answer that question, and answer it in the

5

abstract,

6

Mow the business that was operated in this case,

7

was operated in a private horae of Petitioner Williams,, It was

0

a private home in a small town in a cluster of 5 private

9

homes. In ether words, the location was such that an interstate

10

traveler wouldn’t just go there by happenstance, a person would

11

only be able to go to the Williams house, and enter the Williams

12

hous.e for gambling purposes, if he in fact knew gambling was

13

going on there and if he in fact, if the people knew that he

14

was the type of person whom they could let in,

15

Now as a matter of fact, this—there is a little

16

misconception in this case. There wasn't a whole group of peo­

17

ple that went to the Williams house on the Saturday mornings

18

in which the travel occured. It was just a small group of

19

people who traveled each Saturday. And it’s generally the same

20

8 or 9 people who travel, and the evidencs showed the people

21

who traveled are repeaters.

22

In other words, the same people would come each week.

23

And some of the people who came, the evidence showed, they didn't

24

just go and buy a ticket in the Williams house, they came with

25

a wad of paper and with money and the evidence shows that at
27

!

least one of them put the money in a cigar box, and the cigar

2

box was the place for the lottery tickets and the money was

3

kept there,

4

Q

Was it on a true highway?

5

A.

The Williams hou^e was near a state highway—

8

Q

Which one?

7

A

What did §eou say?

8

Q

which highway?

9

A

State highway 200, or state highway A 1 A, which

10

was two blocks from the center of town—

II

Q

12

A

13

Which town?
Yulee. Yulee, Florida, which was on interstate

17, and most of the people who came from Georgia?—

14

Q

That's the one that goes on to Savannah?

15

A

This goes on to Jacksonville, I believe,

16

Q

Yes,

17

A

From Savannah to Jacksonville,

1 don't know where it started. And most of

18

the people who came from Georgia, came down Interstate 17 and

19

truned on highway 200, and then there's a little access road

20

near the Williams house and they drove up to the Hilliams house,

21

and stayed a very short time.

22

They would stay about 15 minutes and then they would

23

leave, Wow that in itself is significant. The lottery itself—

24

the winner of the lottery wasn't determined until 2;00 p.m., but

25

these people would come there on Saturday morning, stay about

20
1

i

1

15 minutes and leave.

2

Q

3

A

That8s a pretty short time.
Right. It—-in other words they would cross the

4

Georgia border into Florida, and immediately stay at the house

5

for a short time, turn around and come right back into Georgia.

6
7

Q

they didn't play any games, any gambling gases

in the house, did they?

8

A

No., there was evidence by a person who worked in

9

the house that on occasion she said sher said tickets to people

10

who came to the houscr.». and she also said that aome of the peo­

11

ple that cams, Shhese two people that the Court of Appeals found

12

were gamblers and not runners, she testified that those two

13

people, when they came on 4 or 5 occasions, they didn't just

14

simply buy a ticket from her, but that they brought a lot of

15

paper, and one of them at one point brought at least $80«,

18
17

What were the tickets for, just to come into

A

No, they didn't come with tickets, they came

the house?

18
19

Q

with—

20

Q

Well those that brought tickets, what did——

21

A

Well the woman who said she sold tickets, and

22

as she said, she sold, them a number, they would pick a number,

23

say, 19, and pay any amount say from 50* to $5.00 and if at

24

2s00 in the afternoon, 19 was the nvmber drawn in Cuba then you'd

25

win 60 times what you bet.

!
2

Q

These were conventional lottery tickets, I sup­

pose, werent' they?

3

A

Well, the tickets were written out in longhand,.

4

I mean there was no written ticket,

ber 19"' and—

somebody would say "num­

Q

Is this really a lottery, or is it a numbers

A

It was really a numbers game, in lottery-- but

game?

specifically a numbers game.
Mow the owners, we submit, warrant the conclusion that

11

Petitioners caused the travel of these people, as we said be­

12

fore you just couldn8t stutable upon this place, you had to

13

know when to come, on the Saturday morning and this warrants

14

the inference that there was prearrangement.

IS
18

Shat the people came because they arranged, with the
operators to come.

17

Q

Does the record show how they caused it?

18

A

Mo, theres s only circumstantial evidence, theres s

19

no direct evidence of any advertisement that anybody said in

20

Georgia, "Coras down to Mrs. Williams® house, in Florida and

21

gamble?. Mo, there5s no direct evidence.

22

The only—

23

Q

what is the evidence, the indirect evidence,

24

outside the fast that the establishment was running, that the

25

people came?
30

i

A

The Indirect evidence is the location, of the

2

establishment, the fact that the people who want there were

3

habitual travelers , that the people who went there were few

4

in number, it wasn't just that anybody could go, and the fact

5

that they came back over and over again so you can look at the

6

inferences implied in the invitation to come again, and there's

7

also the fact that you had to know what time to go there.

8

9

In other words, the people generally came on a short
period on a Saturday morning, you had to get there before noon.

10

IS

Mr. Glaser, suppose somebody told somebody that

11

a lottery was going on in the Williams home. And the guy stopped

12

by on the way back from Georgia, and he hit the lottery that

13

day—

14

A

Right.

15

Q

--“-and he went back to Georgia, and told every­

!6

body in Georgia. And everybody in Georgia came down to gamble.

17

Would the Williams® be guilty?

18

A

They might be guilty, I would say they-would'

19

definitely be guilty if after the person came the first time

20

they in essence said come again.

21

Q

All right, but that's not in my case.

22

A -

I think if they could foresee, 1 think that3s a

23
24
25

more difficult problem than we have to reach in this case,—
Q

That's all right, you're going to get to my

point eventually.
31

\

1

A

I would say that—

a

Q

You mean they should tell the people, "If you're

3

from Georgia, I don't want your money"? That's the only way

4

you. can escape. Is that right?

5
©

A

Well, if a person from Georgia came to this

gambling establishment, and the operators didn’t know that

7

this particular person came from Georgia, I would say that they

8

didin1t violate the statute,
4

9
10

But—
Q

If the man comes in and says, "I’m from Georgia,

II

and I just left Georgia, and I want to play a number,", the

12

only way for him to escape under this statute, as interpreted

13

by you is to say

14

crosses the state line—

15

A

!,Wa take no Georgia money," Mo money that

He would take a risk if he took the Georgia

16

money. The Georgia bettor. However, I don't think that's this

17

case, I think in this case the circumstances are such to make

18

it come within 18 USC 2B which makes

19

liable who causes an act to be done.which if directly performed

20

by him would, fee a federal offense.

In other wisrds, 18 USC 233 was added in 1948 to the

Nothis isn't—

The point I was trying to make—

25

Q

—come from—
34

1

a
3

Q

What was the evidence here, which supported

the governments burden oh wilfullness ?
A

Well, it seems to us that the continuous busi­

4

ness conducted at this establishment with awareness that people

5

from Georgia were coming, the same people—

6
7
8
9

Q

Was it prooved that these Petitioners were avare

that their customers were from Georgia?
A

Yes, sir, I would say that the proof did show

that» As to Mrs» Williams, ahe was related to one of the indiv­

10

iduals in travel, and there was another - - - there were two Williams

11

in the case, and one Williams, Charlotte Williams was a close

12

friend of hers»

13

So she was aware of that. As far as Rewis is concerned ,

14

he would arive at the place afc a time when there were a- lot of

15

cars parked there iocluding Georgia cars. So I——

16

Q

X gather, then, the government isn't arguing

17

that travel, that these Petitioners were travelers beeuase of

18

anything they did, but rather they are caught under traveling

10

because the law, Section 2 provision, causes an act which if

20

performed by another would be an offense, is that it?

21

A

That is correct. And under 18 USC

2, three or

22

four Courts of Appeal have held that when an employer of a gambl •

23

ing operation employs individuals Mho li\ye in another state,

24

and these individuals travel from some state, Xllinios to Wis­

25

consin, that that violates the statute.

35

f

Now 1 would assume that-*—

z

Q

That being- "they" as employees, traveling for

3

that purpose, violate the statute? And -their employer who causes

4

them to do that traveling from state to state is therefore a

3

principle under Section 2.

6

A

Yes t We would — that under 2a he would foe an

7

aider and abbettor. In other words 2a seems to imply a situation

8

where all parties are clearly guilty of a violation. Whereas,

9

2fo implies a situation where the jurisdictional element or an

10

element of crime may foe committed, may be done by somebody who

11

himself may not be guilty of an offense»

12

13

Q

That in fact is the Bass case and related cases

imvolving problems in Memphis to west Memphis —

14

A

That, is correct»

15

q

-- by employees with the employer 1lying in

16

Memphis, as I recall®

17

A

18

Right» The Bass case and the Rizizo case and the

Barrow case®

19

Now the problem of causation, as i said before, when

20

you have an extortion case where the extortionist lives in one

21

state and he extorts money from somebody in the other state,

22

and in the course of the extortion that person travels in inter-

23

state commerce or. uses an interstate facility, I think it's

24

easy to see that the fear induced by the extortionist causes

25

the jurisdictional element which completes the offense.

A

On the grounds that

the evidence was insufficient

to show that—

A

To show that they were runners. That they were

20

what? Innocent bettors?

21

Can a bettor be guilty if he comes every Saturday, and this was

23

case out of this, anyway?

24
25

A

I dont think the evidence was $75 a week, the

evidence showed that Rewis had $1500 in his pocket and I would

37

infer from the evidence that this is just one of the places

that Rewis stopped at, and there's also evidence that in the

hibifcs 41 C, which indicated that there were three different

5

groups of sailers totalling at least 20 individuals, in addition

6

the runners and pick up men , in this operation„

In other words—

8

Q

Well, I*m just saying that—

9

A

No, I also think that sometimes—

10

Q

The largest bet was $5 and $153 was the whole

A

Well, that was the largest bet that this indiv-

11

worlds?

12

13

idual said she sold tickets at the house, she said the largest

14

individual bet she took on one nvmber was $5« she said that—

15

Q

well, anyway, getting back to 2b—

IS

A

Right»

17

Q

I gather the government doesn't claim that it

18

could prevail if the people who were induced to come across

19

state lines x^ere all innocent. Is that right?
A

20

If the people who were induced to come across

21

st&te lines were all innocent we think we still could prevail

22

under 2 B.

23
24
25

Q

Well, you have to, don't you, in this case,

because they were all innocent?
A

Well, the Court of Appeals held them so, that's

38

I

correct»

2

Q

3

A

The Court of Appeals—

4

Q

The Court of Appeals held them all innocent, but

6

We11—

said except Rewis.
A

The Court of Appeals held them innocent by a

7

ruling that a bettor who traveled in interstate commerce couldn' ;

8

violate 18 USC 1952«

9

Q

All right» If thatss 3b, this speaks of"causes

10

an act to be done which if directly performed by him, or another

11

would be an offense against the United States'9 so as far as

12

the Court of Appeals is concerned

13

mit anyoffenses against the Unites States. Is that right?

,

these bettors did not com­

14

A

Yes, sir.

15

Q

Welly than how do you hold Rewis?

16

A

We hold Rewis under—-when 18 year old see 2B

17

v;as enacted, the revisor® at least thought, and this is set

IS

forth on page 12 of our bridf that section 2B "removes all doubt

19

that one kho puts in motion or assists an Illegal enterprise

20

but causes the commission ®f an indispensible element of the

21

offense by an innocent agent or instrumentality is guilty as

22

principle even though he intentionally refrained from the

23

direct act constituting the completed offense.”

24
25

In other words, even though he did everything but
one particular element but you got somebody else;to me the best

example of this case is the Kelley case which is cited in our

Z

brief»
Now the Kelley case involved the use of telephones®

3
4

tod the defendant there made an arrangement whereby the bettors

5

would use the telephones® tod the Court of Appeals for the

6

Second Circuit found that that violated the statute® That he

7

SEUsed the use of an interstate facility when the bettors usad

the telephone.
Basically, to sura up, we think that just as if Rewig

?i

and Williams had advertised in Georgia, where people would corae
from Georgia to Florida, and people who read their advertisement

12

came from Georgia to Florida with the specific purpose of bet~

13

ting and they did

14

come to Florida and bet, that in such circumstances w® thin?”

15

Rewis and Williams would bring about the cause to travel of

16

the bettor that that situation is similar to the situation here.

so on the basis of reading this advertisement

But for the conduct of Rewis and Williams in operating

17
18

this lottery and making it possible for these people too come on

19

a continuous basis to the operation, there would have been no

gambling®

21

25

Q

Is that the only lottery place inuilpper Florida?

A

X would assume it isn’t®

Q

Well why is this one so unique? And I’m still

waiting for an§r evidence to show that either — did anything
to entice the people to come there ® Other than to run a place
40

1

that was open to everybody

2

A

Well they ran a place, The people that cams,

S

circumstantial evidence indicates that the people who came

4

were aware of the fact that in order to participate

S

operation you had to get down at a particular time, you had

6

to some to a private house—
Q

7

in this

How can you get .any of that to them? All ypu’ve

8

got is circumstantial evidence with cars with Georgia license

9

plates showed up, How many?

10

A

On each Saturday, as I understand it, the average

II

number of people who showed up, from Georgia or Florida

12

were from 8 to 16«

13

Q

How many—

14

A

Eight, I understand, was the average number»

15

Q

From Georgia?

16

A

The total number of people who came were, average

18

Q

And how manyfrom Georgia?

19

A

There were, the same people didn’t come every

17

8e

20

week, they came four or five times, but apparently at least 8

21

to 10 of them came from Georgia that they could identify,

22

Q

All day?

23

A

What?

24

Q

They came in all day, or just,—

25

<B

No, they would come in at a particular time on
41

?

Saturday morning, they would come Saturday morning, usually

2

from 1C to 12« And they would stay a short time——

3

Q

4

A

No, it would just operate on Saturday morning-™

S

Q

You have no evidence that they caused it to come,

6

A

What?

7

Q

You have no evidence that they caused it to corae,

You mean they didn’t stay all day?

8

as I understand it. It gets down to the fact that they did

9

come.
A

10

Well, they did coma, they came on a regular

11

basis, they came at a particular time, they came to a place

12

which was a privat® home, and they came to a place -that only

13

somebody wh©8s aware of the fact that betting was going on,

14

so from that point of view we consider it all prearranged.
Q

15

Mr. Data, would it make any difference to

16

your case or you position if the evidence showed that they did

17

a hundred thousand dollars worth of business every Saturday, or

18

a hundred dollars worth of business every Saturday?

IS

A

No, sir.

20

Q

The volume has nothing to do with the violation

A

Not under this act. Frankly, under 'the new act

21

22
23

does it?

that Congress just passed, it does, but not under this act.

24

Q

What sentenced did these men get?

25

A

Rewls got five years, Mary Williams got three

Q

On each count?

3

A

Yes* to run concurrently.

4

Q

Concurrently. So if any count is good* it3s—~

S

A

If any conviction is good* it's moot.

6

If I may point out briefly* the significant, difference

7

between the government and our position as I see it here* is

8

the interpreta!ton of Section 2B of Title 18. How whoever

9

causes another to do an act* is limited.

10

Title 18 * Section 2B is simply an agency-principle

II

relationship. You can't ©reate a new crime. If John Doe had

12

nothing t© do with this case* but caused these people to travel

13

from Georgia to Florida* he wouldn't be convicted. Because

14

the people themselves were not. commiting crimes.

15
16

Q

Well what about what Mr. Glaser referred to in

the legislative history?

17

A

But that's only if——

18

Q

Or is that the rivisors note?

19

A

But that doesn’t really apply to the factual

20
21

situation here. Thank you.
Q

Was there easy evidence fromyour viewpoint of

22

which it could be found that these people did cau&ethe people

23

to come from Georgia* except that they came?

24

A

Ho* Your HOnor.

25

Q

Do you -think that the fact that they came repeated

43

1

ly and were known has probative fore©?'

2

A

l don 1 bslieve that the record well bear that

3

out, that assumption of facts. Actually, on the 14 Saturdays of

4

surveilance, the most repetition was -that one person same on

5

4 different Saturdays.
