ORAL ARGUMENT BY MICHAEL MELTSNER, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

7

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Meltsner, you may

proceed, I think, now if you are ready.
'MR. MELTSNER:

8

9

We will now hear argument

the Court:

.Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

This case is here on writ of certiorari to the

10

Supreme Court of North Carolina to review the court's judgment

ii

that Petitioners, over 40 Black youths between the ages of

12

11 and 15, were not entitled by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amend­

13

ments to trial by jury in juvenile court proceedings held to

14

determine whether they had violated state criminal laws.
The cases arose out of a conflict between'Blacks and

15
16

whites in Hyde County, North Carolina, over the manner in which

17

the county school board chose to implement this Court’s

13

decision in Brown versus Board of Education.

19

almost the entire Black population boycotted the public schools

20

in 1968.

21

As a result,

During the months of September to December the

22

Petitioners were taken into custody by state police and

23

charged with willfully, intentionally and unlawfully impeding

24

highway traffic in violation of the state criminal statute

25

which, at the time of trial, provided a • two-year maximum
2

1

penalty for adults.

2

One juvenile was charged with willfully becoming

3

disorderly and defacing school property, in violation of two

4

other state criminal statutes which at the time of trial im­

3

posed a-maximum penalty of two years in prison for adults.

6

Petitioners were, tried in several groups in the

7

District Court of Hyde County, a court of general, -civil-.and

8

criminal jurisdiction, sitting as a juvenile court.

9

case, with the exception of one juvenile charged with dis­

In each

10

orderly conduct and defacement of property, the police officer

11

testified to observing groups cf Black youths marching,

12

singing, carrying signs, playing catch with © basketball, all

13

in such a manner as to stop cars on a public road.

14

According to police testimony. Petitioners were

15

warned that they were violating criminal law and ordered to

16

disperse.

17

Whan they did not do so, they were arrested.
The trial judge found.that each Petitioner had

18

committed an act for which an adult may be punished by North

19

Carolina, law, was in need of cars, protection and discipline

20

from the state.and was thereby a delinquent.

21

finding the petitioners delinquent, the court sentenced each

22

to a state institution for an indefinite term until release by

23

the state board of juvenile corrections or until reaching

24

majority.

25

Immediately after

Thus, Petitioners could have been incarcerated for
3

1

from six to ten years, respectively.

2

this sentence to probation.

3

Appeals and the Supreme Court of North Carolina held that the

4

14th Amendment doss not give a juvenile a right to trial by

5

jury in a juvenile delinquency proceeding even though he may be

0

incarcerated many years as a result of an adverse decision»

7

Q

8

of these Petitioners?

9

A

Then the court suspended

On appeal both the- Court of.

Now* was there any commitment to incarceration

The commitment was suspended by the trial

to

court and later excised from the judgment on the Supreme Court

11

of North Carolina* in a technical modification of the terms of

12

the judgment,

13

Q

So that they have never been confined?

14

A

Mo»

15
16

All the Petitioners were placed on

probation.
And it is Petitioners' submission that under Gault*

17

Winship and Duncan* a juvenile tried for violation of state

18

criminal law and subjected to incarceration for years* is en­

19

titled to a jury trial unless the state shows* as the state has

20

not shown here* that provision of trial by jury will compel the

21

state to displace or abandon substantial benefits conferred on

22

the juvenile by the juvenile court system.

23

This is a question which we believe is seen more

24

clearly if we first put to one side certain matters which the

25

Court is not being asked to decide.

4

1

This case does not involve a jury trial where a

2

juvenile does not want one.

3

due process requires any change in the discretion of juvenile

4

authorities to divert cases from court prior to trial for

3

probation, counseling, action by private or public social

6

agencies or physicians.

7

No claim is made in this case that

r

No claim is made vihich restricts the juvenile court8s

8

freedom to structure treatment or rehabilitation to the needs

9

of the juvenile after he has been adjudicated a delinquent.

10

No issue is present of the right to trial by jury if a juvenile

11

is not charged with criminal conduct, faced with the stigma of

12

the delinquency adjudication and subjected to what amounts to

13

punitive incarceration.

14

And finally, no cl aim' is made that Petitioners are

IS

entitled to trial in a courtroom open to the public other than

16

by reason of the presence of a jury.

17

of the trial court to exclude the public, which North Carolina

18

law now confers, is not affected.

19

In short, the discretion

Now, Petitioners contend that, far from harming the

20

juvenile, a jury trial enhances the liability and fairness

21

and protects against erroneous conviction by ensuring compliance,

22

with the reasonable; doubt standard.

23

Q

Mr. Meltsner, perhaps at that point this is

24

not a fair question, but would you hazard a guess as to what

25

would have happened had there been a jury trial at that time in

5

1

North Carolina?

2

A

In this case?

3

Q

Yes.

4

A

WEI!* that is, as- Your Honor suggests, quite

5

a guess, hut all I can say is that this is peculiarly a good

6

case for a jury because the events from which the criminal con­

7

duct arose are the sort of events which Blacks and whites are

8

likely to perceive in a very .different manner.

9

out ©f a racial clash in this community.

to

This case arose

Sc, while I can5fc, for the moment predict what the

11

jury would have decided, X do think that the Petitioners here

12

would have felt that they had received the judgment of the com­

13

munity and found that judgment more acceptable for that reason,

14

if it was adverse to them,.
Q

IS

I was going to say you would also hazard a

18

guess that

17

would have been taken in this case?

18
19

20

had a jury trial been available that opportunity

A

Petitioners made timely motions for a jury

Q

I ask this because of -the statements in the

trial —

21

brief that if a jury ~ a right to a jury trial were present,

22

nevertheless the exercise of that right has been rather sparse

23

in practice.

24
25

A

That is the experience of the juvenile courts

in ten or eleven or so states which provide trial by jury as
6

1

amply documented in an amicus brief of the District of Columbia

2

Public Defender Service# which surveyed the operation of these

3

courts in 2S cities and towns in the United States.

4

Q

And you make this argument to buttress the

5

provision that imposing a right to a jury trial will not over-

S

whelm the juvenile process?

7

A

That is correct? that is correct.

B

Q

Under state law could these Petitioners have

9

been tried in criminal court under criminal penalties and
/

10

A

Nos they could not? they could not.

The

11

juvenile court in North Carolina has exclusive original juris­

12

diction of all minors up to the age of 16 and these juveniles

13

were between the ages of 11 and 15,
When a juvenile ie charged with a felony, Mr. Chief

14

|
j

.

15

Justice# aujd he is over the age of 14# the juvenile court may

18

hold a hearing and waive jurisdiction to an adult court,

17

Q

Then these Petitioners could have been waived?

18

A

No# because the offenses were classified as

'19

misdemeanors under state law# although they were subject to two

20

year' penalties at the time of trial.

21

Now# the benefits which we claim flow to juveniles

22

from the availability of a jury trial# .1 will somewhat arbi­

23

trarily describe as benefits flowing first from the Duncan case;

24

second from which the third class of special juvenile court

25

advantages —

7

t

G

Mr, Meltsner, could X ask you first, before

£

you go or, would you anticipate that the jury trial you re­

3

quested would involve submitting to the jury only the question

4

of whether -the acts charged were committed or whether you would

5

want the jury to decide the ultimate issue of delinquency, or­

6

is there, in North Carolina, any difference between the two?

7

A

At the time of trial, Mr. Justice White,

a

there may have bsen a difference, but the state law has been

9

amended while this ease was on appeal, to make an issue' of

* •' : /»

10

delinquency, as I read the state statutes, identical to the

11

question of whether a youth violated the state 'criminal laws.

12

Q

Under the current law there if the act is

13

found to have been committed it is — there is an automatic

14

conclusion of delinquency?

15

A

That is correct»

16

Q

In some places

17

A

That is my impression? yes, that in some places?

that isn’t so?

18

che law was as it was in North Carolina; that there is a vagus

19

and ill-defined class of offenses which a judge can determine

20

to be delinquency.
0

21

So that right now there is no rufis» for a judge

22

saying he may have committed this act but he is not a delinquent

23

child?

24
25

A

That is my impression — it’s the way 1 read

the statute.

8

1
2

4

Q

If there was room for that under the North

Carolina law, would you insist that the jury be given the task
of deciding on delinquency as well as the task of deciding
whether the act was committed?
■■

S
6

A

Well, I think that the jury would have to be

charged as to the kind of conduct which it was finding the

7

facts to determine a violation, and certainly the jury -could

8

find specific facts and the judge could draw the legal —

Q

So you would be content if the jury only had

the task of deciding whether the act was committed?

Let me take it back, because I, quite

honestly, Mr. Justice White, hadn’t thought about this before, :

13

but my conclusion is not that.

I’m even unclear about the law previously,
9

j

1

A

I'm even unclear about the law previously,

2

because 1 have not been able to find any state court decisions

3

dealing with the issue for construing the statute.

4

How, it seems to me quite clear that the youth -is

5

as likely, as in Gault, to profit from the protections enun­

s

ciated by theCourt in Duncan against an arbitrary, biased,

7

corrupt, or overzealous judge or prosecutor.

3

hardened judge or a compliant,- judge; one who, perhaps seems to

9

credit police testimony because he has seen police officers

10

Or a case-

testify so often against convicted defendants.

II

And likewise, that the youth is also as likely as an

12

adult to benefit from the common sense and community viewpoint

13

of a jury.

14

of the trial judge and nc judge, no trial judge has more power

15

than the judge of the juvenile court.

16

gets, in exchange for hie right to jury trial is a judge who

17

is not a miracle worker.of juvenile court theory. He is not a

IS

specialist.

IS

In short, -the jury is a check on the vast powers

The judge who the youth j

In North Carolina fee is elected; he serves the court

20

of general, criminal and civil jurisdiction andhe need not

21

even be a lawyer.

22

survey of the President's Crime Commission in 1967 shows that

23

75 percent of all juvenile court judges spend less than one-

24

quarter of their time in

This conforms to the national experiences a

/

2S

"juvenile court.

Twenty percent were

not lawyers; twenty percent had no college training whatsoever;

10

1

©na-half had no college degree and 80 percent had no regular

2

psychologist or psychiatric help in their courts.

a

G

Mr. Meltsner, help me in another respects

4

to what extent does tfc* North Carolina Juvenile Court have,

5

shall I say, jurisdiction over juveniles?

6

on probation or under one control or another for how long?

■1

Until 21?

8

h

On probation until 21j yes.
So that the- younger the alleged offender is

9
10

Can they put them

the longer his possible probation?

1!

A

That is correct? that is correct.

12

Q

And if a boy is 20 he has less risk that one

m
14

who is 16?sq far as duration of control is concerned?
A

Under North Carolina law as it presently

IS

exists now, the youth is subject to the jurisdiction of the

IS

court until he is 21 except incarcerations will terminate at

il

age 18, unless the state board of juvenile corrections certi­

IS

fies that the youth is in a special program, vocational train­

19

ing program and so should be kept.

20

So, the extent of the sanction does vary with age,

21

although the juvenile’s top jurisdictional age is 16.

22

there is always going to foe at least two years in which the

23

youth will be subject to some for® of sanction.

24
25

So

Certainly the. youth is bene fitted byhaving a jury
administer the ‘reasonable doubt standard which this Court held

11

1

he was entitled to in Wins hip.

2

as a standard to be administered by the jury and it is plainly \

3

a higher burden for the prosecution to persuade, .six or 12 man

4.

to a subjective standard of certainty.

Reasonable doubt was formulated

5

In addition to the weight of numbers, a jury gives

6

content to reasonable doubt bymaking sure that men with di£-

i

'
7

ferent backgrounds and perspectives and outlooks concur in the

8

result.

9

Now, there are certain benefits which a jury trial

10

give© which I think are specially seen in juvenile court,

1!

because the juvenile judge is bombarded with inadmissible

'12

evidence i evidence 'that comes to him if he holds the waiver

13

hearing which I mentioned before, or evidence which comes to

U

him by reading social reports describing the youth8s family

13

and background, ” which North Carolina law explicitly permits

16

him to see before adjudication, before he has made a final

17

determination of delinquency;by Section 7A-285.

IS

These reports are — 'the access the judge has to

2©

these reports is easy because he even hires and fires the men
• '
who accumulate the informations the probation officers.

21

* h second reason why the jury trial is an especially

o9

!

21

appropriate protection for the youth in juvenile court, is that.?

23

*'
'
the juvenile judge has traditionally seen himself as acting on

24

the needs rather than the deeds of the child.
• r~

25

Thus he is more
*

likely.to see a finding of delinquency as a prelude to

12
1

1

treatment rather than punishment, and 1 would submit it will

2

be more difficult for him to hold the balance true whan

3

applying a reasonable doubt standard.
It's simply easier to convict, given human nature,

4

5

than to believe that something good, called "rehabilitation,"

6

as presently practiced by the state is a benefit to the youth,

1

and will follow adjudication of delinquency.
Now, it is said, in answer to these benefits, that

Justice Brennan.
A

Our position is the public can be excluded

under the very standard which we say here gives us a right to
jury trial, because including the public may be — that’s not
‘this case, but it may be harm to the juvenile and if ifc is,
then perhaps under dvi® process tests the public can be ex­
cluded, but that is not the issue in this case and our primary \
argument is that this process does not harm the juvenile,
giving him the right to s. jury trial.

It doesn't delay pro­

ceedings as the Public Defender Service's brief has shown.

17
i

Even if there is some delay I think the Court has crossed that ;

bridge in Baldwin ftsSjere ; it applied a right to a jury trial in

the busiest court in the United states of America, withthe

biggest backlog and said that administrative conveniences would
