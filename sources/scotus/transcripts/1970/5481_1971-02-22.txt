ARGUMENT OF HERBERT PHILLIP SCHLANGER

5

APPEARING PRO SE

6

MR. SCHLANGER:

Thank you* Mr. Chief Justice* and

7

may it please the Court.

This case comes to you on writ of

S

certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to

§

review its affirmance of the District Court for Arizona's dis­

10

11

missal of my petition for writ of habeas corpus for lack of
\
jurisdiction over the Respondent.

12

The question presented is whether a District Court

13

lacks the power to inquire into the lawfulness of restraints

14

exercised over a Petitioner who is present in its District*

15

when the persons responsible for those restraints are else­

16

where.

'

Stated in other words* can a Petitioner be in custody
—<•

\1

and within the jurisdiction of a District Court, but not be

18

in custody within the jurisdiction?
»

29

After-i.8 months of litigation* the allegations con­

20

tained in my petition for writ of; habeas corpus remain unconfcro-

21

verted.

22

United States Air Force, and in 1965 re-enlisted for a period
I

Those are* that I enlisted over eight years cigo in the

23

!
of six years, in order to enter the Airman's Education and

24

Commissioning Program and obtain a commission.

25

At that time, I was assigned for duty to Arizona

2

I

State University, and enrolled there under the AECP.

2

attended -the university from January of 1966 until June of

3

1968g ten weeks before my scheduled graduation, at which time

4

I was summarily removed, purportedly for having demonstrated

5

a lack of officer potential by cutting some classes.

I

In fact, as alleged in my petition, I was removed

6

7

because of my participation in the formation and leadership of

3

the Arizona State University Civil Rights Board, a group which

9

sought to quiet and adjudicate ethnic and racial grievances
/
arising on campus by working with university and city officials»
/

I

10

The removal was unlawful both substantively, in that

11

12

it violated First and Fifth Amendment rights, and procedurally,

13

in that it violated regulation and due process requirements of

14

the Fifth Amendment.

15

While attempting to obtain a hearing or reinstatement,

16

or administrative remedy, I was reassigned to Moody Air Force

17

Base in Georgia, and was relieved of duty as an officer trainee.

18

I was denied access to the evidence that was used against me»

19

I requested, but was denied, a hearing.

20

denied, a discharge, first by the Chief of Staff of the Air

21

Force, and later by the Air Force Board for Correction of

22

Military Records and by the Secretary of the Air Force, Dr.

23

Seamans„

24
25

I requested, but was

During this entire period, of course, X was/ performing
my duties as an enlisted man at Moody Air Force Base and was
-

-

f
2

promoted twice, first to sergeant, then to staff sergeant, both
.

non-commissioned officer ranks»

In May of 1969, I requested a

3

temporary duty assignment to return to Arizona State University,

4

so that I might complete my degree requirements for a Bachelor's

5

Degree in mathematics in the summer session, since I was only

S

ten weeks away from my degree»

7

Since I had apparently satisfied my superiors that I

8

was doing my job in an outstanding manner, 1 was reassigned to

9

Arizona State»

The order said that I was to be assigned for

m

70 duty days, and was permitted 15 days leave in conjunction

12

with that temporary duty assignment»

12

After completion of my schooling in Arizona, while I

13

was still in Tempe pursuant to those orders, I filed the

H

instant action for habeas corpus»

15

by the Court, without issuance of a show cause order, and

16

reconsideration was denied»

17

Circuit, and returned to Georgia to continue my duties»

18

It was immediately dismissed

I then appealed to the Ninth

I requested expeditious action, and in December of

19

1969, the Court of Appeals scheduled the argument»

20

the case while on leave from Moody, and the case was remanded

2.1

to the District Court for issuance of a show cause order»

22

it became apparent that the District Court would not regain

23

jurisdiction prior to my removal to Georgia, Judge Browning of

24

the Ninth. Circuit entered the injunction.

25

I argued

The Air Force immediately terminated my pay and

4

Mien

1

allowances, an act which I consider unlawful but which is not

2

of issue at this time.

3

Q

This second period of attendance at. the

4

university was under a program quite different from the first

3

one, was it not?

6

A

Yes, sir, it was.

7

Q

Under Operation Bootstrap?

3

A

Yes, sir.

9

Q

During this second interval, youweretherefore

10

in a different status from a military point of view, weren't

H

you, on permissive temporary duty, something like that?

12

A

Your Honor, the

Government's briefmakes

this

13

distinction between a permanent assignment and a temporary

14

duty assignment.

IS

having left Georgia under those orders, if I went anyplace excep h

16

to Arizona State University to enroll in school and attend

17

classes and get my degree that summer, I would have been

13

prosecuted as being AWOL.

19

I felt that having been issued the orders, and

There is this difference, in that my permanent duty

20

station in the AECP was Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio,

21

with duty at Arizona State University? and under Bootstrap, I

22

was paying my own expenses.

23

Georgia, and I was assigned for duty at Arizona State.

24
23

My permanent duty station was in

I think the distinction is minimal; certainly the
orders existed authorizing my travel to Arizona and attendance
5

i

1

at the university there.

2

Q

Well, one directed your travel? the other

3

permitted your travel.

4

A

Is that right?

Yes? sir? but both were voluntary programs.

I

5

had applied for entrance into the Airman’s Education and

S

Commissioning Program because I wanted both the degree and the

7

commission.

3

Q

9

But your claim on the merits is that that was

a condition of your re-enlistment? isn't it?

10

A

Yes? sir.

n
n

Q

But this second attendance at the university

was one? well? Operation Bootstrap? at your own expense?

13
14

A

It was necessitated because there

was no other way for me to get my degree prior to my discharge.,

’IS
18

Yes? sir.

Q

Haven’t you got also a habeas corpus proceeding

pending in Georgia now?

17

A

No, sir.

No longer.

That had been on appeal

38

to the Fifth Circuit on an issue of exhaustion of remedies? and

19

all the remedies suggested by the Government have since been

20

exhausted.

21

Fifth Circuit containing their order entering a voluntary

22

dismissal? since the question of exhaustion is moot now.

23

I believe I submitted to the Clerk papers from the

ment’s position concerning jurisdiction, the Fifth Circuit and

25

the District Courts of Georgia no longer have jurisdiction in

the matters- since I have been removed and reassigned to Iceland,

2

If, on the other hand, the Court holds for my position contend­

3

ing that the District Court of Arizona does have jurisdiction,

4

then it should properly be remanded to Arizona rather than

Georgia, since that was the first filed action and that is

where the cause of action arose.

Court of Appeals simply affirmed on the basis of an earlier

12

decision which held that a serviceman on leave voluntarily at

13

a place other than a duty station is' not in custody at that

14

point.

15

The

The Government now takes up this argument, and argues

'16

that custody — you can be in custody, since I was concededly

17

in custody on the day I filed, and that I can be lawfully in

18

Arizona, which I was on the day that I filed, but that I was

19

not in custody in Arizona, under the meaning of 2241.

witnesses for a hearing, if it should ever be held, are present,

be called? and at which any evidence, outside that under the

7

control of the Respondent, is, that is, university records,

8

professors' records, and things like this,
I cannot see that there is any bore in the statute,

9
10

and indeed, Ahrens v. Clark, in which Mr. Justice Douglas wrote

11

the opinion in 1948, held that it was the presence of the

Petitioner which was the threshold requirement to filing the

They are substantially accurate, but there is a

However , when I filed my action it was on my next to

This was all done

immediate superiors.

12

Q

The next question is the reason for your

13

instituting the action in Arizona rather than Georgia, and

!4

perhaps you have answered it, the presence of witnesses there,

15

records, and so forth?

16

A

Yes, sir.

I really feel that should a hearing

17

be held anyplace else, in any District except Arizona, and

18

should we ever have to the substantive issues of whether I

«9

was cutting classes, whether cutting classes demonstrates a lack

20

of officer potential, whether the proceedings did follow Air

21

Force regs., that it would be necessary to call these witnesses.

22

Without them, I cannot prove my case.

23
24
25

Q

Of course, even if you were venued in Georgia,

maybe the case could be transferred to Arizona.
A

Well, sir, the way I understand 1404(a), which
9

1

is what I assuitis is being referred to, Arizona would have to

z

have had jurisdiction originally.

3

been able to have been brought in Arizona in order for it to be

4

transferred by the Georgia court to Arizona,, and yet if this

S

Court now finds that Arizona could not have jurisdiction because

6

I was not permanently stationed there, then it could not be

7

transferred.

8
9

It would have had to have

The concern with this kind of question, it seems to
me to be more a question of venue, as Mr. Justice Blackmun

10

pointed out, than really a question of jurisdiction.

n

think that there is any question but that I was in custody,

12

and within the jurisdiction lawfully, and for a purpose con­

13

nected with my service.

That District i3 not incidental to either the action

or my military duties.

could only bring it in the District of Columbia*

Q

Only there, because- that is where the Secretary

of the Air Force is?

5

A

Wells- apparently, Your Honors it has been held

6

by this Court -- never directly , but at least implicitly — that

7

the District Court for the District of Columbia has jurisdiction

8

over American citizens outside any other District Court, and

9

therefore the District of Columbia would be a proper district,

m

I would like to see, Your Honor, an eventual develop­

ii

ment of habeas corpus so that a Petitioner could file either

12

in the district where he is feeling the effects of the custody,

13

or in which ---

H
IS

Q

Well, you would be feeling the effects of the

custody in Iceland.

16

A

Yes, sir.

17

Q

And that is no U.S. District, there.

'18

A

19

There is no doubt about that.

Yes, sir, but for purposes of habeas corpus,

that would be the District of Columbia.

In civil litigation,

20

- it appears that, following International Shoe, the courts have

21

; developed a contact doctrine, a contact theory *■ and where we

22

extend this right to civil litigants, I really cannot see that

23

it would be of tremendous inconvenience to any party to extend

24

it to

25

military petitioners for habeas corpus.
Here we are

relatively free to travel at certain
11

1

times, when we are off duty or when we are on leave..

There are

2

incidents which occur, such as my removal from the program in

3

Arizona, which, if the military is allowed to remove me at thei::

4

will or whim, thus depriving that Court of jurisdiction, we are

5

sanctioning what is, in essence, foreign shopping by the

6

military»
I really do not believe, sir, that it was a coinci­

7
e

dence that following my removal for civil rights activities

9

from Arizona State University, I was assigned to southern

!0

Georgia, with all due respect to the South, sir»

II

the Government felt that any further proceedings would be looked

n

upon more dimly in the Middle District for Georgia than, perhaps,

13

in the Southern District of New York»

Q

I feel that

Viewing that, if one should accept your theory

15

all the

13

around at any one of the 50 states, and fly up to North Dakota

17

and bring your habeas corpus action up there»

18

way, if you had a week's leave you could just look

A

No, sir, I do not believe so»

I think that

19

Judge Lazansky from Massachusetts had a case similar to the one

20

you describe, where a gentleman from Indiana came wandering

21

intoMassachusetts with

22

Q

Right»

23

A

In McKay v» Secretary of the Air.Force»

nothing but a suitcase and a petition»

Judge

24

Lazansky looked at the facts and circumstances of the case, and

25

said you have no contact in this district»
-

12

-

This is the first

1

time you have ever been in Massachusetts»

2

for filing it here.

You have no reason

Go elsewhere.

3

1 feel that the District Courts are more than com­

4

petent to decide whether there is sufficient contact between

5

the District and the issues involved in the case.

6
7

Q

with personal service* as you know.

8

A

9

Q

10

SI

Of course * International Shoe contact has to do

Yes, sir.
What limits would you put on it, what test?

Would you just leave it to the discretion of the District Judge?
A

I would say, sir* that broadly,, for those

iz

people contesting their induction,, let's say* which I am not*

13

this is an enlistment* but the induction of conscientious

14

objectors* for instance.

15

claim* might* in fact* be where their local draft board is.

16

Much of their evidence* to prove theix

If a person is inducted in New York City and then sent

17

to Port Banning* Georgia, the Army may hold a hearing, and it

S8

may just be perfunctory* as has happened in several cases? if

19

he is then forced to bring the action in Georgia he has the

20

choice of either expending huge sums to transport his witnesses

21

down to Georgia, if indeed they are willing to come* or, in fact,

22

not being able to demonstrate in fact that he has a basis for

23

his claim* which would preclude his winning his action.

24.
25

Q

So you say he should at least be able to file

his habeas corpus action in the place where he lived when he
13

1

was inducted.

2
3

A

Q

Well then, would you confine it to the District

with the most significant impacts on the case?

6
7

Yes, sir, because that is the District with the

most significant impact on the facts of the case,

4
S

Is -chat it?

A

I am searching for some way to simply say that

I would like to be fair and equitable,

8

Q

9

A

Yes., sir,

JO

Q

Undoubtedly, you have thought a great deal

IS

I donst mean to be,

more about this case than we have so far, and ■—A

12

Yes, sir.

Well, I have been grappling v/ifch the

U

same questions, at what point do you say you cannot file,

14

would say that where the contacts within the District are.

15

immaterial to the case, then it obviously should not be brought

16

there.

17

obviously a permissible District, and as in most of the rest of

18

the law, there is a small gray area in between, which 1 think

19

should be left to the discretion of the District Courts

20

individually.

21

I

If the contacts are crucial to the case, then that is

Your Honor, unless the Court has some further

22

questions on this issue, I would like to reserve the rest of my

23

time for rebuttal,

It is important because it involves

It

Perhaps this case can be better understood if it is

thought of as a. case involving an application in the nature of

habeas corpus, rather -than habeas corpus itself.

20

We recognise, of course, that habeas corpus is not

21

limited now, as it once was, to parsons who are actually

imprisoned.

to persons who are denied admission to the country, to parsons

Sergeant Schlanger was physically within the jurisdiction of

view he was not in custody there, and there was no one in

Arizona having jurisdiction over him and he did not allege that

11
12

there was.
The relevant allegation is on page 3 of the Appendix,

Then he goes on to say, "Colonel Reddrick is the

District Courts do not have nationwide jurisdiction

Yes, sir, but the way I understood the

Yet, in the brief they can see that it was properly filed,

since 1 was in custody under the statute.

No, sir, even on the point that that one is

still pending, let's assume that argument just for the moment.

Colonel Baker has no control over me.

petition.

He is now in the same

is commanding a military unit at a place at which I have been

21

stationed.

He has no direct control over me.
My Commander in Iceland

12

I filed a motion with the

13

Clerk to amend my petition for habeas corpus, and presumably

14

for certiorari also, to add my Commander in Iceland as a

15

Respondent.

10

Q

He and Dr. Stevens have the custody now.
Aren't you merely arguing that there was a

17

breach of contract, which the Solicitor General says you are

18

arguing?
A

petition.

Yes, sir.

That underlies the habeas corpus

That gave rise to the action.
Q

What else do you have, other than an alleged

breach of contract?

23

A

To rest my habeas corpus

24

Q

Yes, sir.

25

A

Nothing at all, sir.
35

on, sir?

Basically, there are a

f

number of reasons why I contend the contract was breached.

2

Q

Do you think that you want to establish a

3

precedent that if a man enlists and they give him a commission

4

as a sergeant/ then he has a breach of contract action that he

5

'

6

can bring by habeas corpus?
A

Your Honor/ 1 would think that if an enlistment

7

is anything but carte blanche to the military/ if promises to

8

induce an enlistment into the military are to mean anything/

9

then we have to guard against an arbitrary use of power by the

10

military authorities.

11

Q

12

Should we give them license---

If you grant all of that in habeas corpus/ the

proper dative is to attack it.

13

A

Yes, sir.

14

Q

Well., suppose the Air Force promised that you

1 believe so.

15

could go to school for three months, and they only let you go

16

for two months.

That would void the enlistment?

\7

A

Well/ sir, I think -----

m

Q

Would it?

19

A

Because in my casef sir, we have a status

20

difference.

21

an officer trainee became effective/ and the statute under

22

which the Air Force Institute of Technology operates provides

23

for professional training and education of officers.

24

nothing about enlisted men.

25

Why is it different from yours?

Q

Could they have prevented you from going the

A

Yes, sir, that was a wholly discretionary

decision on their part.

Q

And so, they let you go?

io

A

Yes, sir.

ii

Q

And then, they revoked it?

12

A

The second time?

Q

7

a

It was something different from just that of a

No, sir.

That was a local decision.

The second time, when I was going at

my own expense, I was allowed to complete my degree requirements.

16

Q

And then what happened to violate the contract?

17

A

The contract had already been violated, sir.

IS

It had been violated while I was in school the first time,

19

under the Airman’s Education and Commissioning Program.

20

Q

21

A

Well, why didn't youbring habeas then?
Because at that point there was an impediment to

22

filing.

I had to at least attempt to exhaust my administrative

23

remedies prior to filing* and I considered that my•administra­

24

tive remedies were exhausted in November of .1 ■) 6 8, when the

Couldn’t it also have ended by your

Couldn't your administrative remedy have stopped

when you re-enlisted?

A

No, sir»

I had re-enlisted in 1965, and then

the alleged breach occurred in June of 1968.

My remedies from

10

that breach were not exhausted until after 1 was removed from

11

Arizona and flown to Georgia.

12

is the question of whether the military authorities can take

13

action which gives rise to a claim for habeas corpus, then

14

remove the serviceman from theit jurisdiction prior to his being

13

able to initiate action because of some impediment or other.

16

Q

And so, what we are faced with

Well, I think the Solicitor disagrees with that.

17

He hasn't even agreed that you have ever had a right of action

18

by habeas corpus.

19
20

A

Yes, sir, but assuming that we did have habeas

jurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction.

21

Q

All right.

22

A

I cannot truly imagine, sir, any other theory

23

under which to bring this case.

4

However, we are talking about a status difference,

S

and if the Air Force, within itself, refuses to even grant ms a

6

hearing at any time, which they have for three years now, on

7

my claims that I was unfairly eliminated from this program,

8

unlawfully eliminated, and denied the status of a commissioned

9

officer for which I had re-enlisted, I can see no other theory

10

under which to bring it than habeas corpus, which challenges

n

unlawful restraints by Governmental authorities.

12

Your Honor, if you have no further questions -—

13

Q

May X ask you exactly what it is you are after?

At this

Yes, sir.

And you want to get that tried under habeas

A.

13

Yes, sir.

I think the Government conceded in

Orloff v. Willoughby that had he been entitled to a commission

15

this would have been a proper action in habeas corpus, but then

16

they denied that he was entitled to a commission and the Court

agreed with them.
The facts in this case, since t*e have no evidence on

never been able to have an evidentiary hearing, remain from my

allegations in the petition.
