MR. GRISWOLDs

May it please the Court;

This case comes here on an appeal from the Three-

Judge District Court in the Central District of California.

12

The case is a Customs seizure case.

The claimant returned to this country by air on
October 24* 1969* arriving in Los Angeles.

During Customs

inspection the 37 photographs involved here were seized, togather with certain other items.

All but the photographs have

been returned* and only the seizure ©f the photographs is
involved here.
It is stipulated that the photographs were intended
to b® incorporated into a hard-covered book and I quote from
page 16 offche record in the stipulation, which book describes
candidly a large number of sexual positions.
On October 31 — I may say the photographs have
bean lodged with the Clerk ©f the Court.

On October 31* 1969

the District Director of Customs, advised the claimant. Lures,

that the matter had been referred to the United States
Attorney for forfeiture action. •
On November 4th the Claimant's

attorney demanded

On November 6th* 13 days

after the arrival in Los Angeles the United States started
X

.......

this action for forfeiture under Title XIX of the United
States Code* Section 1305-A* a statutory provision which is
printed at pages 2 to 4 of our brief.
Sight days later the claimant filed an answer and
counterclaim* contending that the photographs were not ob­
scene and that the statutory provision was unconstitutional.
He moved for a three™judge court because he sought a declara­
tion and an injunction against the enforcement of the statute
and an order to convene a three-judge court was entered on
November 20* 1969.

The hearing was held on January 9* 1970

and the three-judge court's opinion was issued on January 27*

1970 „
The Court treated the motion for an injunction as a
motion to dismiss and assumed that the pictures are obscene.
That issue has' never been adjudicated and was directly involved
bjsare.

What the court did was fco rule that the statute is
unconstitutional on its face and as applied.

It reached this

conclusion by an application or perhaps one can fairly say* by
an extension of this Court's decision in Stanley against

3

.

i

Georgia, in 394 US.

2

Although the claimant had stipulated that he had

3

imported the pictures for commercial use the court held that
*

4

he had standing to attack the statute on the basis of his

S

application for importation for private use, to which it said

6

the Stanley case applied»
The court also held the statute unconstitutional

1
8

under Freedman against Maryland, in 380 U.S., because it

9

failed to guarantee that any restraint on allegedly obscene

10

material would be imposed for only a specified brief period

11

prior to judicial resolution of the issue of obscenity,

on November 17th»
Stanley against Georgia is obviously an important
case* one that will be discussed for many years to come.

It

j

has roots in the Boyd case of 80 years ago and Justice
Brandeis8s dissent in the Olmstoad case, in Justice Harlan's
dissent in Poe against Oilman, in Justice Stewart's memoran­
dum in Mapp against Ohio and in this Court's decision in
Griswold against Connecticut»
It is not -the worst for the fact that its con-»
elusion has never been firmly bound to the text- of any par-ticular constitutional provision»

That fact may indicate,

however, that though sound in result, the verbalization may
be subject to further refinement as applied to particular new
situations.
In the Stanley ©pinion itself, the Court seemed to
cover a cais© such as this.

It distinguished earlier cases on

the ground that they, and I quotes "Deal for the most part
with the use of the mails to distribute objectionable mater­
ial or with some sort of public distribution ©r dissemina­
tion»"”

That appears on page 561 of 394 U .S.
It referred to other cases as dealing, and I quotes

"With the power of the State and Federal Governments to prohibit or regulate certain public actions taken ©r intended t©
be taken with respect to obscene matter,"citing prosecution
for sale and distribution»

That likewise is on page 561»

I believe there is .
And it

The court below held that it would be unconstitu­

his importation was avowedly a commercial one.

z

As 1 have indicated, we think the Court was wrong

in its decision as to importation for private use.

4

think that there is legitimately a difference between impor­

Then the casual tourist coming back with the

This is* however*covered by a Bureau of Customs

circular* cited in the footnote to page 26 of our brief* which

was developed by the Customs Bureau and the Department of

worth looking at? it8s the footnote on page 26.

15

that the first examination shall he made "as soon as possible'

It provides

sistent with prompt, yet responsible administrative and

22

judicial proceedings on the issue of the obscenity of the

materials seised.

Mid for these reasons, and because Stanley against
Georgia doss not apply to this case, where no privacy of the

home is involved and because the importation her® was commer­

cial and the claimant should not be allowed to assert any

The Government in Byrne, initially, stated tfeatit

$
Now, at the time of Roth, the |
i
Court was faced really with choices that the Court is always

7

faced with.

8

forward and I was here than and I was making an absolutist

9

argument,

3

10

that has happened since Roth^

There were three arguments that were being put

I was saying that obscenity was absolutely protec­

ted.
There was before the House the old Hicklin

ckling? 11
m

argument that obscenity had a very broad reach in terras of

13

minors or portions of a book condemned the whole world,

14

what the Court did, it seems to me was to strike a balance

15

and 1 must say in retrospect the balance was one that, although

16

I didn’t agree with it then, as I look back, it has a logic

17

t© it.

13

And

The balance that was struck was to try and get at

19

the legitimate interests of society in this whole area and

20

there was an enormous amount of protection given to such

21

material in the Roth case even as the Court said that obscenity

22

was outside of the protection of the First Amendment,

23

almost everything that this Court has .done since Roth, with a

24

few unhappy exceptions, but almost everything that has been

25

done since then has been to furthermore narrow the reach of

Until finally in Rowan the Court came down
j

The truth of the matter is that this Court has

17

said even that, or suggested ■— now, I know that Mr, Justice

18

Brennan suggested in the earlier cases the Kingley Book case,

19

that a judge without a jury wasn't qualified.

There was a

20

thought they would need juries? and yet we see with many jury

21

cases coming up that the juries also are not able to make this

22

sensitive judgment, so jury verdicts have been overturned by

23

this Court-, -which was necessary then, of course,. to_act as a

24

supercensor to everybody9® discomfort and so this Court has

25

been attempting, I submit, and properly, to extricate itself

-

r

front having to sit as a hoard of supercensors.
And what has corns down out of all this„ it seams
to me, is to get away from this business of reading a book
■

and looking at a movie and sayings this is good ©r this is
V

bad,,

It's futile and I think in that sensa that the Stanley

opinion really synthesizes all the legitimate interests and
says a number of things? first of all it says that Government
simply has no business telling people what to read or view®
All of the traditional arguments are n© good? protest his
morality ~ that's his business; Government shouldn't protect
the morality of individuals»

Anti-social conducts no proof

©f that at all* and besides when the conduct appears it's
time enough to act.
In shorts, the Court seems to have said -- now,
let's get to it, and what is it that we're concerned with?
We're concerned with minors. We have said so in the Ginzburg
against Mew York Times,

Minors can be protected.

We5re

concerned with thrusting it upon unwilling audiences because
the truth of the matter is that for many people to have
strong, explicit sexual materials thrust upon them is very
offensive; not too unlike, perhaps, the analogy in Chaplins!?.-/,
which is thrusting and has some kind of a physical,emotional
reaction.
But, beyond that, fe© say that Government has the
right to tell adults that they ought not to read this because

25

iit
!

they may become aroused sexually or because they may have

2

sane fantasies.

3 !

really brad, a great deal ©f lawlessness.

We know not that that was a futile task which
It bred a great

Seal of lawlessness below because the standards were always

4

impossibly vague and there was always an enormous amount of

5

hypocrisy.

6

and so it was that after some 14 years of dealing

7

j

with Roth and with a number of suggestions as to where wewe re

3

*

going.

9

Mr. Justice Brennan In Jacohellis suggested back in

1964 that perhaps it would be wiser and better if 'the states

10

were to pinpoint there legislation at minors * when then seemed

11

to be the major concern of society.

12

Then in the Ginzburg case? Ralph Ginzburg, another

13

legitimate state interest, governmental interest emerged, and

14

that was the business of thrusting it upon an unwilling

15

audience,

16

had then finally in the Sam Ginzburg case the Court

said that, minors could have a different standard.
17
So that this Court, before Stanley, had carved out,
18

mi

it seems to me, and had suggested most of it in Redrup, had

19

carved out legitimate state interests and had said that here
20

the Government has a legitimate concern and the other side of

21

the coin, we submit, is that beyond 'that there is no legitimate

22

concern.
23
And that I believe is where Rowan also seems to

24

have a relevance to this, because Rowan — it8s not mentioned

ORAL ARGUMENT {Continued) BY STANLEY FLEISHMAN, ESQ,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR, FLEISHMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice.

Comment was made earlier of the fact that most of
the lower courts considering Stanley have concluded that it
has -the meaning that we attribute to it here.
there is good reason for that.

And I believe

I believe, truly, that Stanley

as we interpret it, represents an idea whose time has come.
Virtually every one of the thoughts expressed la Stanley have
found reflection in the Lockhart Commission Report, which
was a study, as Your Honors know, of some two years.
For example, in Stanley it was stated that there was
no evidence that the reading or viewing of obscene material
had any anti-social effect.
concluded.

That’s exactly what the Commission

The Commission statedsEmperie&X investigation

supports the opinion of a substantial majority of persons pro­
fessionally engaged in the subject, that exposure to sexually
explicit materials has no harmful cause or role.
They go on to say that it appears to be a usual and
harmless part of the process of growing up in our society
and a .frequent and nondamaging occurrence among adults.

The

Commission Report also stated that this material, this explicit
I

30

1

material which was felt to be totally valueless? in fact,

2

does have a great deal of value that many persons find that

3

they are benefited by having exposure to this material.
I suspect that this was part; of what was meant in

4
5

Stanley when the Court said that Mr. Stanley had the right to ;

8

satisfy his emotional and his intellectual need® by viewing

7

this motion picture film which was plainly, extraordinarily

8

explicit*

j
The Commission also found that, a majority of

©
10

people in this country believe that adults ought to be able to

1!

read and review this material, this explicit material if they

12

so choose.
The Commission also found that a majority of the

13
14

people believe that minors ought not be exposed to such

15

material.

16

morality, which has been discussed here, and also came up

17

with the conclusion, and with some arguments I think are

18

persuasive, that historically and consistent with the First

10

Amendment there simply is no power: in government to try and

2©

control the morality of individuals or society by reason of

21

what goes into their heads as opposed to the conduct of

22

persons.

23

The Commission addressed itself to the question of

The argument has been made here in the brief and

24

by the Solicitor General, that you have to have a stopping of

25

this material at the border because otherwise you don't know
31

j

!

how the material will foe used»

That's exactly the argument

Z

that the state made in the Georgia case»

3

if the state was powerless to get the materials while it was

4

at the home, than there would foe difficulty of law enforcement

5

and this Court said that has never bean thought to foe a

6

sufficient reason to interfere with the great rights that

7

were being asserted in Stanley»

8

agains were the rights to satisfy an intellectual and an

9

emotional need of the individual.

Georgia argued that

And those great rightss

10

which 1 believe also supports the argument we are making here

provision which says that the Secretary of the■Treasury, in

IS

commercial purposes.

10

that can foe exercised.

20

The provision 1 have reference to is -the so-called
There is in this Customs law a

There is no limits on the discretion.

Now, the Government argues:

. of course that pro­

21

vision doasn81 mean anything now because under the opinions

22

of this Court if -the obscenity is a classic it has redeeming

23

social value and therefore is protected so there is no need

for the exception.

9

Q

Does it give a definition of a classic?

10

A

It does not; it does not»

ii

And the way it's

been applied really, has been strictly on a class basis, Mr.

12

Justice Black.

That is to say if the Secretary of the

13

Treasury and his friends think it's good then it can be brought;

14

in, but if it8s below their intellectual standards then pre­

IS

sumably it"s not a classic and it may not be brought in.

!

16
17
18
19
20

Q

Dos8t you think you could have a little more

precise definition of a classic than that in the abstract?
A

Not really the way it's been applied by the

Secretary of the Treasury.
Q

■ Perhaps not for a criminal statute, but I

21

think — don’t you think it could be a little bit less ex­

22

pansive than you have contested?

23
24
25

A

Perhaps? perhaps this was broad argument, Mr.

Chief Justice.
The argument has been made by the Solicitor General
33

;

t

i

that the Appellee here does not have standing to attack the

2

statute on its face, because as he quite properly points out,

3

we did stipulate that the material was to be used commercially

4

under the limitations that we have spoken about.

3

The Solicitor General doesn’t deny the general rule

6

that whether the statute would affect First Amendment rights

7

that you don’t have to shew that the particular conduct is

©

covered by the person who raises the fact that the statute is

9

unconstitutionally broad because of its possible chilling

10

effect upon freedom of speech, but the Solicitor General says

11

that there is an additional requirement: the statute must not

12

only foe overbroad but it must be vague, and he says this fact,

13

of course, is a model of clarity and there is no vagueness in

14

this customs law.

15

Mow, I submit that if we do have to have both over™

16

breadth and vagueness, we have overbreadth and we do have

17

vagueness.

18

more vague than the obscenity statute, plus the fact that the

19

line that the Government suggests, is a line between commer­

20-

cial and noncommercial, without any attempts to refine how that

21

might be spiled.

22

it8s really not commercial if a person just charges what it

23

cost him, for example„

24

commercial or possibly not commercial«

1 doubt that there is a Federal statute that is

For example: there are cases which say that

One would look at that as possibly

The truth of the matter is that the obscenity -™

25

34
1

1

this customs obscenity law is vague# rather than being over­

2

broad# and that the Appellee does# in fact# have the standing

3

to challenge it and that the court below was quite proper in

4

stating that if there is any way that the statute could be

S

applied in violation of-constitutional rights then it should

6

be stricken down»
-

I hasten to add that we also contended below and

7
8

we contend here that the court below should have reached the

9

other view# alsos that it was not only unconstitutional for

to

the reason given#- that it would interfere

with the right of

11

consenting adults to import obscene material# but it was also

12

unconstitutional# we contend# because it interfered with the

13

14

say# to put the pictures into a hard cover book for distribu-

rect construction# the limitations# rather than Congress has

and that the —- any statute that went beyond that would be

That# we believe is the cor­

So that it is our position that the court below

19
20

was plainly right on the ground that it decided the case and

21

that it was also an order to go beyond that»

22

is up and I can only say that the point of procedure in the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY ERWIN N. GRISWOLD,

§

SOLICITOR GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

6
7

MR. GRISWOLD:

In the time I have available I want

S

t© make only two points.

9

said that I was not aware of any cases which had taken our

First, in my principal argument I

10

view with respect to Stanley.

On that I was wrong? I think

1?

it is a mechanic of the Solicitor General's office that I see
the cases we lose and don't see the cases we win.

'12
13

There are, in fact, three decisions of Courts of

14

Appeals, all of which I think can b© distinguished somewhat

IS

on their-facts.

16

another could be®id to be pandering, but the First Circuit,

17

the Fifth Circuit and the Ninth Circuit have all held that

18

Stanley-should not be enlarged, and with the Court's permissior

19

I will submit a memorandum to the Clerk which gives the cita­

20

tions in these cases.

£1

Soboloff's opinion in United States against Melvin in 419 U.S.;

One of them is a clear case of pandering and

I would like only to read in Judge

"The case of Stanley against Georgia, decided this

22
23

year and relied upon by the Appellant is not to the contrary.

24

There the Supreme Court merely struck down the statute as

25

unconst: .tutional insofar as it made criminal the mere private
36

i!

1

possession of obscene material in one's own home.

2

decision did not deal with Congressional power to regulate

3

interstate transportation of obscene material by common

4

carrier.K

The

i

5
8

And then finally there is a three”judge District
Court decision in —

7

Q

Was that a Customs case?

3

A

Ho; that happens to be a transport by common

9
10

carrier ease,, which is like the next case we are going to
present to ‘the Court, which is Mailer, but I think the prinI

11

ciple of the extent of Stanley is exactly parallel in all of

12

them»

13

Q

You have got the citations in the three cases?

14

A

Yes, Mr* Justice*

The United States against

15

Melvin, the one t© which I just referred; 419 Fed 2d, 136, a

16

Fourth Circuit decision? Prague against the United States,

17

428 Fed 2d? 1211, a Fifth Circuit decision and plainly in­

18

volving pandering? and Miller against the United States, 431

19

Fed 2d, 655, a Ninth Circuit decision*
And then 1 would like to refer to the decision of

20
21

the three-judge District Court in Georgia; Gable against

22

Jenkins, 309 Fed Supp* 998, which also took a narrower

23

expansive view of Stanley*

24

this Court affirmed the decision below per curiam in 397 U«S*

25

205»

a non-

It was appealed to this Court arid

And that should surely have been cited in our brief*
37

I would like only to say in conclusion that I think

1

2

there is a verbal explanation for these words in the Stanley

3

opinion which have caused us trouble.

4

said* it spoke twice of the right to receive information or

5

ideas* but in the Roth decision the Court said that obscenity

6

is not ideas or information and so that language in Stanley

1

may have been very carefully chosen to exlud- the right to

The Court in Stanley

receive obscenity.

catch it.

It’s true that in the Stanley case the Court said—

j

Q

;

May 1 have that citation? I didnst quite

The affirmance here in 397?

A

The affirmance* Mr. Justice* is in 397 O.S.

14

Q

I thank you.

15

A

Two Members of the Court thought that

12

205.

13

16

probable jurisdiction should be noted* but the Court affirmed

17

the decisio».

18
19

Q

Thank you.

A

In the Stanley case it is true -that the Court

said it would not decide whether the movies in Stanley had

20

ideational contenti that iss constituted information and ideas*

21

under the facts of that case because of the risk ©f Stanley's

2£

First Amendment rights inherent in that inquiry.

23

But that again returns one to Stanley's right not

24

to have his thoughts pried into.

25

38
ii

If® need not concede* and do

not, that the right to receive information and ideas referred
to in the Stanley opinion included the films there involved,
