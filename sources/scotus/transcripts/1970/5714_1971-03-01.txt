ORAL ARGUMENT BY PETER E. RINDSKOPF* ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

?0

MR. RINDSKOPF:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

pleas© the Courts
This is an appeal from a three-judge Federal

n

Court* pursuant to 28 United States Code* Section 1253.

12

Court denied the Appellants5 motion for preliminary and per­

13

manent injunction against the application* enforcement*

u

execution of Georgia Code Annotated* Section 34-1010.

15

That

Section 34 of the Georgia Code is the Georgia

16

Election Code and I think

17

refer to the individual sections as* for example* Section 1010.

18

for convenience sake I will just

The Appellants in this case are the Georgia

19

Socialist Workers Party* candidates for Governor and for two

20

of the Congressional Districts in the State of Georgia* voters

21

who desire to support them and the class ©f persons who desire

22

an opportunity to consider persons on the ballot other than

23

Democrats and Republicans.

24
25

Section 1010 of the Georgia Election Code provides
simply that inorder to get on the ballot unless you come within
2

1

stated exceptions, you must secure the signatures of 5 percent

2

of -the voters who were registered to vote for the office that

3

you seek at 'the last time it was previously offered for

4

election.

5

torate .

6

It is a straight 5 percent ©f the registered elec­

In the case of the lead Appellant, Mrs. Jenness,

7

the candidate for Governor of the Georgia Socialist Workers

8

Party , 5 percent of the number of the registered voters at the

9

last time the office she sought would come out to be some

10

08*175 signatures.
Q

li

Is that a requirement* Mr. Rindskopf, that

12

the signatures-need to come from a specified number of counties .<

13

of anything such as that?
A

14

No* Mr. Justice Stewart, we do not have am

15

distribution problem except insofar as, for example, in a

16

Congressional candidate» the signatures must
Q

17

They have to come from the District, of

18

course.

They would have to come from the constituency, but

19

the Governor always has a statewide constituency —

20

A

That8s correct.

21

q

— anywhere in theconstituency.

22

A

Yes, Your Honor.

23

Q

In other words, for

the gubernatorial

24

candidate they could have all come from Fulton County, for

25

example?

3

\

2

A

They could have all come from Fulton

County? that®s correct»

3

Q

The ©dE&idate for a Congressional seat

4

wouldn't need anything like 80,000 signatures an a petition,

3

though, would he?

6

A

No, Mr. Chief Justice, in the two districts

7

with which vie are concerned, which are the Congressional

0

Districts which divide the City of Atlanta, the Fourth and

9

Fifth, the numbers were 10,000 and 11,000.

10

Q

Mr. Rindskopf, as I remember in Williams

n

against Rhodes the figure was 15 percent of actual votes cast?

12

am I correct in that?

13
14

A

That is corrects 15 percent of the vote

Q

And here it is 5 percent of the registered

case.

15
16

voters.

17

meet?

Which is the more difficult of the two provisions to

A

18

As we have attempted, as we shown in our

19

brief at page 8 and page 9, in Georgia the number of voters is

20

generally about 50 percent of the number of registered voters,

21

or it has been in the last two gubernatorial elections.
So, fcfecj -5 percent total here actually works out

22
23

to something in the neighborhood of 10 percent of the votes

24

cast.

25

Q

Incidentally, is a write-in permissible in

4
s

1

Georgia?

2

A

Write-ins are permissible»

3

Q

Your answer fcd Justice Blackmun would be

4

what?

5

Which is the easier?
A

Wall,., the 5 percent here comes out to

6

slightly less than the 15 percent in Ohio»

7

about 10 percent by the Ohio standard* so Georgia5s requirement,

8

is some percentage points easier* in terms of numbers * than

9

Ohio „

10

It comes out to

I might add thatsince that time Ohio has changed

11

its laws* reduced its percentages* and in a three-judge Federal

12

Court decision this summer those reduced percentages were held

13

unconstitutional»

14
15
16

Q

There were other factors in the Ohio case

that are not present in this statute?
A

I think that's certainly correct* Mr»

17

Justice Harlan,

The first time the case was here; I am not

18

so certain thatit was correct when it was back in Ohio,

19

were dealing with a number of tine laws which this Court had

20

already struck down and it seems that they were pretty well,

21

«ible to isolate out the number of signatures required and

22

strike that down on its own rather than as part of an en­

23

tangling web* as the Court has said»

They

24

Mien I say that 'the candidates here are candidates

25

of the Georgia Socialist Workers Party* I should point out that
5

1

the Georgia Socialist Workers Party is a political body,

2

according to the laws of Georgia, which means two -things; it

3

means first that its candidates failed to receive 20 percent

4

of the votes the last time the office of Governor was contes­

5

ted and, it means -that its candidates failed to receive 20

6

percent of the nationwide vote for President.
.

7

But, it also means one more things it means shat'

0

the party is registered with -the Office of the Secretory of

9

State pursuant to Section 901 of the Election Code, which

10

basically requires the party to go through the same procedures

11

that a corporation would to register.

12

bylaws, submit the names of its officers, and any other infor-j

13

matron the Secretary may, in fact, desire.

21

22

It has to file its

The Georgia Socialist Workers Party has complied
with this requirement.
Q

This is the status that the Republican

Party occupied for quite a long time in your state; isn’t it?
A

Well, it is and it is not, Your Honor.

The Republicans, of course, have been on the ballot by peti-

I

tion at the last gubernatorial election before this one.
Q

And they were they by petition because

they occupied the status of your client?

23

A

That’s correct.

24

Q

And their candidate, in fact, as I remember

25

That is correct.

then got a larger vote than the man who was declared governor.
6

1

A

He received a plurality.

2

Q

Mr. Bo Callahan or something?

3

A

CAllcway, Your Honor.

4

Q

Calloway.

5

A

Also pursuant to the Georgia Election Cede,

8

the candiates of the Georgia Socialist Workers Party were

7

nominated by the party to be its candidates for office in a

8

convention of the party and certification of the nomination

9

was filed with the Secretary of State.

10

So, we don41 have here exactly the case of com-

n

plefcely independent candidates.

12

have had to go through at least one hurdle before they get to

13

•the problem of gathering signatures.

The nominees of the party hare,

14

On the other hand,, party candidates in Georgia,

15

belonging to a party which collected 20 percent of the votes

16

for Governor or President, need not gather any signatures at

!7

all, nor need that party in its primary, secure any definite

IS,

number of votes before they can get on the ballot for the

19

final election.

20

of signatures that Mrs. Jenness would have been required to

21

secure, exceeded the number of votes that were actually cast

22

in the Republican primary for the winner of that primary.

23

He got some 62,000 votes; Mrs. Jenness would have had to get

24

some 88,000 signatures.

25

;
I

Q

And in fact, in the.instant case, the number

What was the total cast in the primary?

7

1

A

Just over 100,000, Your Honor»

2

So, it was just slightly in excess of the

3

signature requirement that she was required to meet»

4

there is absolutely no requirement once a party qualifies as a

3

party that it, in its primary, before it put its candidate on

6

the ballot at the final election, show any scintilla of voter

7

.interest in the party»
Q

3
9

But,

Except that, the party must have received

at least 20 percent of the votes the last previous election»

10

A

At the last previous election»

11

Q

And that, on© can infer is strength,

12

continuing strength in a political organization that has

13

managed to acquire that much vote, I suppose»
A

14

15

Georgia was strictly a ©na-party state.
Q

16
17
18

Well, up until very recently, of course,

Yes, as you just said, up until very

recently the Republican Party of Georgia occupied the status
that your client now occupies.

19

A

20

I might add that the 20 percent requirement came

21

22
23
24
25

That's correct.

:„n for the first time in 1964} prior to that time to be a party
and be on the ballot regularly, going back to 1943, all you
needed

was to obtain 5 percent of the v@*fce at previous elec­

tions .
Before 1943, going back to the Georgia Code of

8

I

1922, anybody could be a candidate who registered himself as

z

such with the Secretary of State.

3

that his party secure any certain number of votes y nor was

4

there any requirement that he, himself get a petition with any

5

number of signatures.
Q

There was no requirement

This 5 percent is bad,'according to your

J

6
7

argument.

Q

constitutionally?

9

What percentage do you think would be all right,

A

Well, of course I would want to

that

m

you don't reach that question in this case because we think

11

the 5 percent is a restriction of freedom of speech.

12

seems to me that, in terms of what's required in the other

13

states, the vast majority of those other states require one

14

percent or less.

15

It seems

But, it

to me that whatever the reason that the
1,

16

state-can come up with for this requirement, it seems to me

17

that really its only justification could possibly be to protect

IS

the ballot against clearly frivolous candidates,

19
20

21
22
23

24
25

Q

Your First Amendment would knock out all

requirements of this type; wouldn't it?
A

Yes, it would, Your Honor; yes, it would.

Unless, of course, the state could show some sort of danger
which would accrue from unlimited numbers of candidates getting
on the ballot.

I don't think that, based on what the Court

said about the Ohio case, or based upon tvhafc the state said
9

1

below here,, that there is any sort of conceivable danger.
Q

2

Mr. Rindskopf, just before the last ques-

3

tion you were tracing the Georgia legislative history and said

4

that at one time there was no percentage requirement at all.

5

What is the implication of that.

6

closely.
A

7

Bring me along a little more

The implication of that? it seems to me?

0

is exactly the same implication that the recent, three™judge

9

court in Ohio on the decision in 318 Fed. Supp. found that wher

10

Ohio jumped its requirement from one percent to seven percent

11

and later back to four percent the state had to show some kind

12

of compelling interest for that increase.

13

show any compelling interest for that increase similarly in

14

Georgia.

15

by the state that the increase from no signature requirement to

16

five percent of the registered voters has been shown.

Ohio was unable to

We would say that there has never been anyshowing

It seems to me that the five percent requirement

17
18

was adopted completely arbitrarily in 1943, but it was con™

19

tinned again in 19S4.

20

nothing in the record in this case --

21

22
23
24
25

There never has been any showing,

Q

What is thepurpose of it, in your estima­

A

I really could not say.

tion?
It's not like the

situation in Ohio where Henry Wallace received enough votes to
cast some sort of doubt about the result of the election,

io

1

because in Georgia, going back to 1872, -everytime there has

2

been a statewide race the Democrats have carried.

O

So, it strikes me that it was a revision of the

4

election code and while they were revising it someone said,

5

well, we should put in some sort of a requirement.

6

nothing in t he legislative history which would indicate any

7

reason for the change from zero percent to five percent.

a
D

Q

There is

There is nothing in Georgia law that

prevented in any way Mrs. Jenness or the two Congressional

iO

candidates from campaigning, to the extent they wanted to cam»

n

paign for the office that they sought, is there?

12

meetings, having all the asso.ciational privileges they want;

!3

making all the speeches they wanted, passing out all the

t4

Iterature they wanted and urging their adherents and supporters

15

to write in their names?

16

A

Holding

It's just as it was in Ohio, there was a

17

state restriction on doing First Amendment kinds of things.

18

The restriction is getting on the ballot.

19
20
21

22
oo

24
25

Q

Well, specifically, the First Amendment

kind of things is rather a broad category.

In answer to ray

question, free to campaign, free to organize, free to do
whatever they wanted; free to pass out literature and make
speeches in support of their candidacy, were they not?
A

Certainly; certainly.

I don't think there

is any question that such a restriction would equally follow
11

1

and we don’t have that here»
There is one specific problem with the write-in

2
3

vote in. Georgia which may not be present in other states,, and

4

thatis that there is a direction in the election code which

5

requires ■> write-in votes to be counted by the people counting

6

the votes exactly as they are written so -that if there were a

7

write-in vote for Linda Jenness and another write-in vote for

8

:-lrs. Linda Jenness,, those two votes would be counted separately!

9

and however many write-in votes went down under the one column

I

10

or under some wrong spelling, would be counted separately and

11

there would be no accumulation of the votes.

12

Q

Well, they would be counted?

13

A

They count write-in votes? yes, Mr.

14

Justice Black.

18
19

There is —

Well, it’s conceivable.

I don’t tjlii-nk.

there is any ^showing in the record as to whether it has ever
happened.
Q

You itfaan in Georgia?

A

In Georgia.

Q

Wall, X know it has. happened in other place

12

1

close by Georgia»
A

2

Welly certainly it has»

Another, restric­

3

tion on the signature gathering that takes place in Georgia,

4

is the requirement thatsignatures be gathered by apperson who

5

is eligible to vote for the office that is being sought»
For example; in the Fourth and Fifth Congressional

6

7

Districts, which divide the City of Atlanta, the Socialist

8

Workers Party-would not gather signatures in the Fifth Dis­

9

trict with a member of its party who was, in fact, registered

10

in the Fourth District.

And this, I think, is an impairment

n

on the signature gathering requirement*

12

sanewhat more difficult than it appears upon its face.

It makes it, 1 think,

It means that unless the party is distributed

13
14

equally among Congressional Districts its chances of gathering

15

signatures in one district or the other depends, not on the

16

17

membership of the party, but on where the members of that
party live.

18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

And —
Q

Is this true in statewide elections, too?

A

Well, of course in a statewide election

anyone living anywhere in the state would be eligible to vote.
Two of the Appellants here, of course, sought Congressional
Districts.

They were not running for at-large Congressional

seats; they were running for specific geographic districts.
And a. major problem, it seams to me, along the First
Amendment line is the problem of oness FCC privileges, ..
13

i

whether one can get free or equal time if one is only a write-

2

in candidate or if one is a candidate who is duly qualified,

3

FCC, or at least the television stations in Georgia have per­

4

mitted people who are registered with 'the Secretary of Slate

S

as write-in candidates, to enjoy equal time.

6

permitted persons who were not registered as write-in candida­

7

tes and who did not meet the signature requirement to have

0

that equal time»

9

They have not

So, to that extent, a failure to either register

10

yourself as a write-in candidate, or to appear — either to

11

register yourself as a write-in candidate or to secure the

12

signatures is? in fact, a limitation on your ability to appear

n

before the public. '

14

In terms of the candidates here, the record has

15

■their affidavits as to poverty,. they •. are presuming in forma

16

pauperis, in fact, in this Court.

17

stipulations ©f the parties as to the expense that was in­

18

curred by the Secretary of STate, in checking the signatures

19

The record -also contains

that were gathered by Mr. Calloway and by Mr. Wallace, when

20

they successfully met the petition requirements.

21

figures are seme $77,000 and $81,000, by the Secretary of

22

State, just to verify the signatores which were gathered.

23
24
25

And those

There was no actual showing in the record as to
how much it cost to gather those signatures, but it would seem
to me to be a highly reasoneible speculation that it certainly
14

1

cost at least that amount to go out there physically and

2

gather those signatures.
Q

3
4

You haven’t brought here the filing fee

requirement, have you?
A

5

No, Your Honor, and in fact, we success™

6

fully challenged that in the lower court and the state has

7

not appealed.

8

■So, if they were able to get their signatures

9

and show poverty they could go on the ballot without paying

10

51

anything.
I think the argument that the state has made

12

here is illustrative of the fact that the stats really has no

13

compelling interest in this requirement.

14

example, has said in its brief that Georgia does not have

15

very restrictive laws and it points to some examples of other

16

states with more restrictive laws.

17

The state, for

For example, states where,

if*, you have voted in a party primary you cannot then come

18

along and sign a petition for an independent or a nonpolitical

19

party candidate.

20

It’s quite true that in Georgia, anybody, as long

21

as he is a registered voter, can sign, a petition.

22

matter if he intends to go out and vote in the Democratic

23
24

It doesn't

this very freeness that Georgia offers indicates that it really
doesn't have any real purpose in imposing the signature

15

1

requirement
I take it then, Mr. Rindskopf, you would

Q

2
3

be making the same argument if the percentage was one percent

4

or a half a percent?
A

5

Well, I certainly don’t have to make that

6

argument in terras of reasonableness, because of course it is

7

here five.
Q

8

Well, X know, but it isn't reasonableness

9

-- if that’s all it is ~ if you, for example, suggested that

10

perhaps the state would have a compelling interest in requir­

n

ing one percent, then it does come down to a judgment as to

12

how much that is worth and maybe the state—

13

A

Well —

U

Q

Wouldn't you argue that there couldn’t be

15

a compelling interest for even a half percent?
A

16
17
18

qualification, that the state might be able to impose some sort
of nonfrivolous —

19
20
21

25

X would think, Your Honor, subject to the

Non frivolous what?

A

Non-frivolous.

I think they might well be

Well, is that a compellinginterest?

Q

By "support," you mean money, resources?

I mean both money, Mr. Chief Justice, and

go out and gather signatures for them, to say nothing of

12

people who might be willing to sign on their behalf»

10

✓ «p*

Q

13

Well, I suppose, at .least J, could, take

14

judicial notice of the fact that some of the very significant

15

political expression in this country is done by young people

16

and others not so young, who are pure volunteers who would do

17

these things if they had a belief? if they had convictions

about that particular issue or party.
How, in terms of collecting, whethefc it’s 10,000

Well, it may very well be that the views

may be very unpopular ones, such as socialism in the State of

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT BY ROBERT J. CASTELLANI,

25

ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF GEORGIA,

18

Mr. Castellani.

OM BEHALF OF APPELLEE

1

MR. CASTELLANI;

9

3

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court;
Mrs. J©nness*s argument arid her attack on

4
5

nominating petition laws is based on two different grounds;

6

the first ground is that she claims there is a-denial of her

7

equal protection rights.

3

The second’ground; she claims -these laws violate

9

her right to freedom of association as has bean- recognized by

to

this Court in William versus Rhodes.
We shall characterize the equal protection argu­

11
12

ment as "The grass is always greener on the other side"
/

13

argument.

14

is not this tremendous imbalance between the two tests or

15

methods to get on the general election ballot.

16
17

In Georgia, as has bean noted by this Court, there

In Williams we had all the additional burdens that,
were placed upon third party candidates.

Ohio completely

18

eliminated independent candidates.

In Georgia, except for the

19

actual vehicle itself, that is the petition method as opposed

20

to the primary method, there is not this imbalance.

2!

matter of fact, as a result of the three-judge court decision

22

below, if you go the petition method then if y$i/;cah allege

23

poverty you do not have to pay any qualifying fees.

As a

We therefore think that this lawsuit is bottomed
on an incorrect assumption.

The assumption that is incorrect
19

1

is that a primary method is easier -than a petition method»

2

We believe that if anyone went through both of these methods

3

he would ssrlou$ly question this assumption.

4

Now? Mrs» Jenness sees a primary as a method

5

whereby a candidate merely sits at home and waits for the votes

6

to come to his door and he is automatically nominated and
i

' ''

7

authorised to go on the general election ballot.

8

is not the case.

9

dous amounts of energy; his own resources;

In fact? that,

The primary candidate has to expend tremen­
his.

organiza­

•20

tional problems, the complexities of a campaign? particularly

Si

for the gubernatorial nomination in Georgia are simply not

12

recognized by Mrs. Jenness when she sees this imbalance betweer

S3

the two methods.

14

Further? if a general primary candidate is de­

15

feated he no longer has a chance to get to the general elec­

16

tion ballot? whereas to the person who is going the petition

17

method, once 'they obtained the required petitions there is no

18
19
20

problem of going on the ballot.

They are automatically certi­

fied and they go on the general election ballot.
Therefore? we believe that while the grass may

21

seem greener to Mrs. Jenness? in actual fact? a close and

22

realistic examination of the two methods to get on the general

23

election ballot in Georgia? will show -that there is no in-

24

equality and her claim on this basis must fail.

25

Q

Your position has brought put .the fact that

11

some states require that when you sign the petition you have

12

to agree to support the candidate in the general election.

13

Georgia has nothing like this at all.
Some states prohibit you from participating in

14
15

any primary.

As a matter of fact, Mrs. Jenness could parti­

16

cipate at the party's primary of her choice in Georgia.

17

could run as a petition candidate and yet go and vote in the

18

primary and vote for the person that she would be mostlikely

19

to oppose in the general election.

She

Some states forbid you.to sign any other petition

20
21

besides the first one.

In other words# the first person to

22

get to you# that's it.

You are disqualified for any there­

23

after.

24

Seme states require that you must not be registered in any

25

political party.

In Georgia you can sign as many petitions as you want.

21

In at least one state — I believe it's Rhode

1

2

Island, they prohibit yon from participating in any primary

3

for 26 months' after you sign a petition.,

4

Now, we did not make an exhaustive study

5

Q

Mr. Castellani, why did they pick this

6

method?

Why did the State of Georgia, at this late date,

7

one? and number two; pick the 5 percent?
A

8
9

Well, sir, the late date was 1943.

Secondly, this method was because 49 of the 50 states depend

10

upon nominating petitions as an alternative in one form or

11

another.

12

use the nominating petition method as an alternative.

Florida is the only state that I know that does not

interests that probably overlap, but the first interest is, as

has been noted by ‘the Court, completely frivolous candidates.

12

too confusing and people just couldn't make up their minds.

13

We think that's an interest to keep it down to serious can­

We attempted to show before -What’s sopeculiar

I appreciate that.

A

---- maybe they chose ten and decided to

But, the thing is they

made it so much easier to gather these petitions.

Most of

these other states with the one percent or the one-and-a-half
or two percent also, and this is what bothers me, is -that in
another state you go out and yon sign one of these petitions
24

1

1 doubt very seriously -that the person who is gathering these

a

signatures tells you; nov; wait, a minute, if you sign this

petition you are not going to be able to vote in the primary.

In other words, you can’t be registered with another party or

that you are going to be disqualified.

anything Mr. Justice Marshall asked you, because I couldn’t

why Georgia moved from no requirement at all to the present
one that’s under challenge?
A

18
19
20
21

22
'23
24

25

I have a guess and unfortunately I did not

prepare myself on this point and I apologise; I probably should
have.

I think that previously Georgia did not authorise any­

body, did not allow independent candidates to run.

You had to

be a party candidate, and then I think that there are several
in
states where this was the case and/my research of this ques­
tion this problem has come up.
There were five or six states where you had to be
25

on a party»

in the direction of liberality rather than in the opposite

direction?

We would also point out to the Court that the

As this Court has also indicated previously, the

nominating petition law does not impinge in any way on the

access to the minds of her fellow citizens and to seek to per­

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY PETER E. RINDSKOPF, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

6
7

MR. RINDSKOPF:

I just have the briefest of points,

Your Honors.

8
9

Mr. Rindskopf, you

First, when my opponent says that the ISM3 laws
were less restrictive than the 1922 laws, he is just plain
/

10

incorrect.

n

Session laws at page 100, it states vary clearly that the

12

names of candidates of each political party and also the names

13

of any other candidates for the offices to be filled, are to

14

be placed on the ballot.

15

candidates for national and state offices-, or the proper

IS

authorities of the political parties nominating them, shall

17

file notice of their candidacy, giving their names and the

18

offices to which they are candidates, to the Secretary of

19

State.

20

In 1922, in the Election Code found in the 1922

And it further providas thatall

So, the 1943 move from no petition requirements

21

to five percent was, in fact, more restrictive.

Up until,-that

22

time anyone could get on the ballot simply by filing a notice

23

of candidacy with the Secretary of State.

24

The second point I would like to make is —

25

Q

They could be on the general election
32

1

ballots?

2

A

That is correct.

The law says "in all

3

elections other than primaries conducted by political partis a,

4

it shall be the duty to place on the ballot the names of party

5

nominees and all others who wish to be candidates."

1

Q

6

Do you care feo comment on the state's

7

interest, in preventing fraud on the voters by use of the same

8

or similar names of candidates?
A

9

Yes, I would.

I think the state is ade­

10

quately protected here in at least two wayss first, the

11

closing date for petition requirements is the same data as the

12

closing date for nominees who wish to enter into a party

13

primary.

14

and file a notice of independent candidacy unless it's a fore- j

15

gone conclusion who is going to win the primary ~

So that you cannot come along after the party primary

16

Q

Sometimes that is in Georgia? isn’t it?

17

A

Well, I think the election spirit is a

18

little more rough and tumble than that.

It's probably safe to

19

say it9s a foregone conclusion that the party nominee is going

20

to win.

But ~

21

Q

The party nominee was what?

22

A

The Democratic Party

nominee usually wins

23

the election.

But, there is a second restriction which the

24

Estate has, and legitimately, and that is that party nominees

25

appear on the ballot, along with a party designation, such as
33

1

Lester Maddox? Democrat.

2

put a fraud upon the voters by appearing under the same name

3

would not have that party designation.
It seems to me that's a clear way of preventing

4

5

what happened to Mr. Morris.
And those would be our points and we have nothing
