ARGUMENT OF LEONARD B. BOUDIN, ESQ. (resumed)
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

6

7

MR. BOUDIN:

Thank you, Your Honor.

8

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:

9

I indicated yesterday three policy considerations to

10

our thought and programs of this kind in declaring his advocacy

11

and membership in advocating organiMtions were not dangerous

12

and nontheless there were restrictive means that might be used.

3

'I would add one thought.

That is the great question

4

as to whether there is really predictability in determining

5

whether people who had membership in organisations like this

6

were advocating — will turn out actually as becoming members

7

of the Bar would be deleterious or delinquent in their duties.

8
9

Now these four considerations that I have mentioned
have led me to two conclusion which I submit to the Court.

The

20

first is whether there should be any screening program of any

21

kind and whether there shouldn't be certain safeguards in order

22

not to have the widespread, wide-ranging inquiries.

23

gest two safeguards to the Court if we are to continue with

24

a screening program.

25

And I sug­

The first is that the organizations concerned with the
6

)

inquiries made is an organisation which has been sound, judi­

2

cially sound»

3

engaging in unlawful activities.”

4

contrast in the questions involved in this case, where the ques­

S

tions are wide-ranging and vague.

I think in Konigsberg 15to be an organisation
Of course there is a wide

And the second consideration I suggest to the Court

6
7

is that there should be some foundations, some reasons to believe

8

before this kind of inquiry is made that the individual involved

9

has heretofore participated in unlawful activities of such an

10

j
organisation.
But of course our principal point has suggested this

11
12

13

i
I

middle ground, a ground that we prefer not to have as against
the next one, is the question of whether there should be any

screening program at all.

And we suggest that in the case of

Rouss there are peculiar susceptibilities to the controls of the
courts makes the alternative the least less “restricted means
preferable to the question of the screening program with the
j
dangers that I have indicated.
Q
program at all.

You don't think there should be any screening
I don't understand what --

There would be Bar examinations?

Oh, yes,

which we are dealing here.
be excluded obviously.
17

I don't mean Bar examinations to

And the fourth point, Your Honors, which I am suggest­

?

2

ing as available as very strong, but less restrictive in this

3

sense, I refect upon First Amendment rights are these:

4

lawyer himself is subject as an officer of the court, as well ask

5

his clients, with the conternet power with recrard to whatever he j

6

may do in the courtroom or with respect
to the cases.
’
~

The

>„

The lawyer alone is subject to the very powerful dis­

7

a

ciplinary proceedings ending in the dreaded disbarment, which is

9

ruinous.

The lawyer in special cases is subject to, of course,

10

a malpractice suit by his client and, finally, as we approach

11

the criminal activities with which we are concerned, the lawyer

12

is, of course, subject to criminal prosecution.

13
14

IS
IS

j

Now this would be my general observation, generally
unrelated unnecessarily to the peculiar facts in our case.

But

in our case, in the circumstances in this case, we think there
,

is neither obstruction of the process of the kind that was found

17

that was found by the courts to exist in Konigsberg and Anastaple.

19

nor a substantial court agent requiring this particular to answer

19

these questions.

20

Now I submit that because, as I submitted to Your

21

Honors in my original presentation, all of the specific questions;

22

that were put to the petitioner, including those that were

23

involved in Konigsberg and Anastaplo, "were answered by him and

24

there is not the slighteatr-jndicati.Qn^Of committing the court

25

that he would not have;- answered any other specific questions.

I

18

?

It was the general ones to which he took exception.

2

And he took exception — I think there is no question as to

3

the matter of basic principle,, because the committee held before

4

it the answers to many of these questions — the files were just

S

loaded -- that he had made in the New York Bar examination.

6

Obviously the changed position was due to the notoriety that was

7

given to our then-pending Lisfcra case which was argued.

3
9

The second point with respect o substantial state
interest, whatever may be the theoretical interest of the state,

10

inasmuch again as in this case no explanation of the kind that

11

was given in Konigsberg by the state

12

in Anataplo, based upon a rule of the court, mainly the concern

13

about the nature of the organisation, is answered in the state's

14

brief.

15

or by its statutes, or

The state's brief did a complete resume, showing why

16

these questions are asked, and it said three things:

17

18

could ask the other members of the organisation whether they

19

might not have some information derogatory to the plaintiff.

20

And this is a kind of a census.

Now with respect to the Fifth Amendment, which is our

second point, the point has bean made by Mr. Biard.

2

repeat what he said except to add two things that he did not

mention:

4

1 will not

The first thing is that we are dealing here with the

5

area of political inquiry, whatever it may be called, and we

6

have to remember that in questions of this kind, bearing in

7

mind the historic arrogance of privilege, which I certainly do not:

8

seek to correct, that its religious and political persecutions,

9

that this is a peculiarly good case, an appropriate case, what­

10

ever they be in other situations, for the recession of the privi­

11

lege.

13

cated yesterday, in Baggett against Bullitt, that real questions

privilege because of the danger of a perjury prosecution, even

16

though, generally speaking, obviously the refusal to answer a

17

specific question on the ground that it might invite a perjury

18

prosecution, is not a possible sense„

19

They present an appropriate reason for asserting the

And last on this point, in addition to the cases that

20

I mentioned, to an opinion of the Court of Appeals for the

21

District of Columbia Circuit, which I failed to mention in my

22

brief, which is at 240 (2d) 405 — 401, in which the Chief Jus­

23

tice participated as a member of the per curiam court, that dealt

24

with this problem of the dangers of perjury prosecution in con­

25

nection with a vague question.

It was a contempt of Congress

Harvey O'Connor.

This, I think, is sufficient for our submission.

Mr. Mack1in, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

Thank you, Mr. Boudin.

ARGUMENT OF ROBERT D. MACKLIN, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

8
9

MR. MACKLIN;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court;
I think at the outset we would like to again emphasise

10

1!

that we feel that this case should be considered with direct

12

reference to the circumstances of the case.

I recall that the

3

petitioner refused to answer questions in the Supreme Court of

4

Ohio application form for admission to the Bar on the privilege

15

6
7
18

9

of the Fifth Amendment, that the answer might tend to incriminat:;
him.
On the face of this application this was the sole
basis for his refusal.

We think it significant that after this

fact ha consulted with counsel.

He then commenced to talk in

20

terras of the protections of the First and the Fifth Amendments.

21

And then by the process of briefs and arguments, we now find

22

ourselves confronted with an attack on the action of the Supreme

23

Court of Ohio, which is almost entirely related to the First

24

Amendment rights.

25

is now relegated to a minor independent ground.

The basic issue, as raised by the petitioner,

2

I do not question the right of the petitioner to argue

1
2

this case on any reasonable relevant ground, but we do protest

3

that there is a kind of transfer of emphasis which detracts from
'
the focal point of the circumstances which resulted in denying

4

6

the applicant admission to the higher Bar examination.
>
In this instance the petitioner's assertion of the

7

Fifth Amendment privilege with the question of whether or not

8

he had been or was presently the member of any organization

9

which advocates the overthrow of the Government of the United

10

States by force and to the question asking for the listing of

11

all clubs, societies or organizations of which he had been a

12

member„

5

14

the questions, inferences, suspicions that had to be dispelled

IS

before they in good faith could recommend him on the basis of

16

his character, his reputation —- and his moral character -- to
the Supreme Court.
Q

18

Mr. Macklin, did I understand in your preliminary

19

remarks that it is your claim that the Bar examiners were not

20

given an opportunity to consider the First Amendment claims at

21

all, that they were confronted only with the Fifth Amendment

22
23

I

Clearly it raised in the minds of the Bar examiners

13

17

II

claim?
A

No, Mr. Justice Stewart, what I am really saying

24

is that on the basis of the application itself, only the Fifth

25

Amendment was raised.

Now it is quite true that in the course oi
22

1

various communications thereafter the Fifth Amendment attack

2

was raised?

3

Q

You mean the First Amendment?

4

A

Yes, by the First Amendment.

S

Q

And in time was considered by the Bar examiners? j

6

A

I believe that their consideration was based

7

almost exclusively on the fact that on the face of the applica­

S

tion there was this single reference to the Fifth Amendment

S

privilege which precluded them from further action.
.

10

Q

■*

Are you suggesting something in the nature of his,
I

it

failure to adopt his administrative processes?
A

12

No, 1 am not, Mr. Chief Justice.

i

I am trying to i

13

establish, if I can, the fundamental reason for the rejection

14

by the failure of recommendation by the Bar examiners, which we j

15

think establishes the basis of the issue in this particular case.
Among the most prominent of the possibilities raised

16

17

by the petitioner's refusal is, certainly in the minds of attor­

In addition^

21

The*potential for incrimination in responding to simi­

clear issue.

of uniformed personnel to guard their persons in their lawful

s

sessions.
Q

7

Mr. Macklin, if you had the applicant answer the j

8

exact question "no," would the other answers — I think to

9

question 13 -- about all the clubs and the organisations that

he has been active in, would that bar him' from taking the exami ­

nation?

A

Mr. Chief Justice, if he had answered that one

particular question ":ao/‘ and then answered the other question

on a Fifth Amendment privilege, I think it would have still profonb

16

Q

Well, what if the answer to that question was

17
18

"I can't recall all the organizations"?

A

Well, sir, I feel very strongly that this would

19

not preclude a further questioning.

21

cut off from further investigation.

We feel that their law is only associated with a group:

dedicated to forceful overthrow of the government.

it to be highly appropriate to inquire into whatever forms of

greater significance than the association of almost any other

20

21

22
23

I think that there are things that you do in

other means of punishing unprofessional conduct as an attorney.
But what I am concerned about here is a before-the-fact advocacy
rather than an after-the-fact problem of retribution.

Mere

advocacy by one unqualified to advocate is to file a complaint
from the advocacy of one who is qualified in its qualifications,
as certified by a court, and has supposedly tested these quali­
fications.
Perhaps in the light of what you have heard me say,

24

you can understand our lack of comprehension.

25

petitioner's brief, he says the only criterion of good moral

28

At page 9 of the

15
1

character is inapplicable to political activities, even if they

2

were to involve the commission of crime.

3

My question is what is this good moral character on

4

the part of a lawyer?

Isn't this what this Court said in the

for membership in the profession in whose hands largely lies

51

the safety of this country’s legal and political institutions."

I sincerely urge you to say it again.
