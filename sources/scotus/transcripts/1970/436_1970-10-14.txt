ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

16
17

We will proceed, then, with Case

ginning #ow.

And who is on schedule

436, Mr. Solicitor General, where you left off yesterday.
MR. GRISWOLD:

I am saving my time for rebuttal,

sir.

Mr. Greenberg, have you

MR. GRISWOLD:
May it please the Court:
Before com\i
mencing my argument, I would like to explain one circumstance.

19

The brief which we have filed covers all three cases, the two

20

Charlotte cases and this case, and it says "Brief for the

21

United States as Amicus Curiae."

22

In the Charlotte cases we were Amicus Curiae, though t

23

a very active one in both lower Courts and here, but in this

24

case we are a party.

25

1967, and we appear here as a party, and the brief should

We have been a party-plaintiff since

30
j

1

have had a somewhat longer caption, as Amicus Curiae for those

2

cases and for the United States as a party in this case.

3

I should also like to make it plain, though I assume

4

it is entirely plain from what has gone on, that we do not sup­

3

port the Board here and never have.

6

counsel for the petitioners here fighting against the dilatory

7

tactics of this Board for the past three years, and we still

8

are, and we do not support the Board in the Charlotte case

9

and never have.

10

We have been with the

In the District Court in this case, after repeated

11

appearances of the case in the Court of Appeals, which are

12

cited in the memorandum which we filed in connection with the

13

petition for certiorari, we submitted a plan on January 27,

14

1970.

15

This was in fact based on one of the HEW plans, but

16

with some modifications, and it was submitted then, following

17

this Court's decisions last term requiring immediate action.

18

It was submitted then as one which could be implemented im­

19

mediately pendente lite, to remain in effect until the conclu­

20

sion of the then-current school year, that is, until June 1970.

21

The District Court rejected that plan.

On appeal
,K

22

to the Court of Appeals in expedited procedure and without oral

23

argument, the Court of Appeals ordered the Government's plan

24

into effect on a permanent basis.

25

That put us in something of a problem. Because it
31

!I

1

was our plan which the Court of Appeals had approved, although

2

We had not offered it as a permanent plan, we did not file a

3

petition for certiorari.

4

the Court, saying that we thought the decision would be re­

5

viewed, and because the petitioners were filing a petition we

6

felt that it was not necessary for us to file a petition which

7

would have involved our seeming, in a sense at least, to at­

8

tack the plan which we had filed with the District Court,

But we did file a memorandum with

Now, the two cases, Charlotte and Mobile, present

9
10

perhaps the extremes of the situations which may come before

11

the Court.
In Charlotte, the district judge applied perhaps as

12
13

drastic a resolution as possible, and we have contended that

14

he may have applied the wrong standard in doing that.
Here, in Mobile, No. 436, the Court of Appeals has

15
16

entered what may be regarded as a minimal order, under the cir­

17

cumstances.

18

Court of Appeals, a majority-to-minority transfer plan, so that

19

no student is locked into any school where he is in the majori­

20

ty race.

It does include, specifically ordered by the

21

Q

Does that also include transportation?

22

A

Yes, Mr. Justice, that includas a non-segregated';

23

bussing and, I believe, priority, that is the right to get into

24

the school even against the contention that there are no places,

25

The order also includes allocation.of teachers, so
32

1

that a great many of the steps which can be taken to remove the

2

appearance of the school as being a black school or a white

3

school have been taken.

4

In our view, it promises realistically to work and it

5

promises realistically to work now, but, I repeat, on a minimal

6

basis.

7

At the argument yesterday, it was suggested by Mr.

8

Nabrit that our position here, and our position in the Charlotte

9

bussing cases, were inconsistent.

We did not seek to appear

10

orally in the several cases that were argued in the latter part

11

of yesterday, but we did file briefs and v;e do support the Dis­

12

trict Court in the Charlotte bussing cases, the -- District

13

Court which held the North Carolina statute unconstitutional,

14

Nos. 444 and 498.

IS

But I believe that our positions in these cases are

16

consistent.

Our position here and there is that the Constitu­

17

tion requires the disestablishment of dual school systems, re­

18

quires the disestablishment of dual school systems, requires

19

affirmative action to disestablish dual school systems.

20

No more, but likewise no less.

21

In the bus case arising under the North Carolina sta­

22

tute, Nos. 444 and 498, we think that the statute interferes

23

with that objective and so is invalid.

24

Here, we think that the order of the Court of Appeals

25

does show promise of eliminating the dual school system, though
33

1

barely so, and thus we support the decision below.

2

I think that this point ——

3

Q

Perhaps I am mistaken, but isn't there possibly

4

a little question-begging in the statement of your position?

5

Isn't the real issue here, what is required to completely dis­

6

establish a dual school system?

7

of the table say that the very disestablishment of a dual

The gentlemen on this side
I
!

8

school system requires the elimination of all racially identi­

9

fiable Negro schools, unless that is shown to be absolutely

!

I

10
11

impossible.
And you say that once a dual school system is dis­

12

established, then neighborhood schools are all right.

13

is skipping over the basic issue, isn't it?

14

to disestablish a dual school system?

15

A

That

What is required

i

1

Surely the problems are very complex and highly

16

interrelated.

I think it is possible to oppose their argument

17

in a form which says that the schools are not disestablished

18

until no black student may be assigned to a racially identifi­

19

able black school at any grade level, which is the position fox

1

20
21

22
23
24
25

i

which they contend.
Our position is that is not required, that it is re­
quired not really tc eliminate any discrimination now, which
i

is what the North Carolina statute does.

If we were starting

out anew with a clean slate and were writing a picture for
what America ought to be, we might well include the North
34

1

1

7

Carolina statute in it.

But the statute was interposed at a

time when there was a great deal of history and a great many
3

practical consequences, and we think that the statute inter­

4

feres with actions that must be taken in order to disestablish

5

what had clearly been a dual school system.

6

Q

Perhaps I should ask my question this way, Mr.

7

Solicitor General.

8

once there has been a disestablishment, a dismantling of a

9

dual school system, then a neighborhood school system is con­

10
11

Your position, as I understand it, is that

stitutionally permissible.
Now, may I ask, what in your view does the Constitu­

12

tion require for that first step, to disestablish, to dis­

13

mantle, a dual school system as a minimum?

14
15

16

A

Well, Mr. Justice, let me start with a slightly

different example which I want to use in my answer.
Suppose we had a school system where there was ab­

17

solutely no trace of any prior discrimination, no dual school

18

system ever, and nothing with respect to public housing or

19

restrictive covenants or anything else, and we find that in

20

this sytem a lot of people of German descent have come to this

21

community, and a lot of people of Slovak descent have come to

22

this community, and a lot of Negroes are living here and a lot

23

are living elsewhere, and in that community we find a school

24

which is all or 90% black, I would say that there is nothing

25

in the Constitution which requires that there be any change in
35

■

!

1

that situation.

2

tliere is no past history of discrimination, I do not believe

3

that anything can be found in the general language of the

4

equal-protection clause or the due-process clause which support!*

5

the position that no black student may be assigned to a raciall

6

identified school at any grade.

7

Q

In other words, if you can find a place where

Wouldn't you want to make that hypothesis include

8

any past or present discrimination?

9

sent discrimination?

10

A

You wouldn't rule out pre­

If there is any past discrimination or present

11

discrimination, then steps must be taken to eliminate it.

12

how extensive, how drastic, those steps are, it seems to me,

13

depends on two things:

14

past discrimination and the effect of that still continued,

15

which is very great in Mobile and certainly considerable in

16

Charlotte, and (b) on the other hand, on this problem on which

17

we have not bean able to find a word—and I have no doubt there

18

never will be exactly one word, reasonable, feasible, absolutely

19

unworkable—I think absolutely unworkable is too strong, I

20

seized upon feasible because I considered it a considerably

21

stronger word than reasonable, but it ought to be explained

22

with words which indicate that strong action is required to

23

eliminate past discrimination.

24
25

Q

And

(a) the extent to which there has been

May I ask you one question?

Why isn't the one

word applied to all the schools whether or not there is
36

1

discrimination on account of race now?

2

A

I think, Mr. Justice, that is clear, provided in

3

the now you subsume everything that has happened in the past

4

and which has its effect now»

S
6

And there is obviously enormous amounts of that ef­
fect in Mobile and a great deal of it in Charlotte.
And to eliminate discrimination now, you have to taka

7
8

steps to eliminate the effects of that past discrimination.

9

In my view, it is not enough to say, well, we will just leave

10

things as they are, but for now on we will be good.

11

seems to me to not take the steps which this Court has long

12

indicated, beginning in Cooper and Aaron and Green and Mont­

13

gomery County, must be taken to eliminate the effects of past

14

discrimination, which effects are effective now.
Q

15
16

What you are saying is that there has to be some

race-mixing?
A

17
18

That

There has

to be some attention paid to race in

the process of eliminating the effects of past discrimination.

19

Q

Including assignments on the basis of race?

20

A

On the basis of race, yes, Mr. Justice.

But

21

the touchstone is, we submit, the disestablishment of the dual

22

school system.
Q

23

Now, you bother me with that, Mr. Solicitor

24

General.

Now, the way you bother me with that is in trying to

25

draw a distinction because something was done wrong in the

37

1

past, ray understanding of the Constitution is that it forbids

2

discrimination on account of race now.
A

3

Mr. Justice, if that

something that was done

4

wrong in the past has a persistent and continuing effect which

5

is present on the scene now, then, it seems to me, that action

6

must be taken to negative that effect.
Q

7

8

Sven though it itself, to do that, would amount

to discrimination?
A

9

Yes, Mr. Justice, I think that is required by,

of this Court, that actions must be taken to eliminate the ef­

There is todciy, as always, a tendency for legal
thinking to be too much dominated by cliches.

Perhaps this is

true about racial balance.
There is likewise, I think, the possibility of great
misunderstanding in the talk about neighborhood schools.
For what it is worth, to the best of my ability, I
do not think that you will find the phrase "neighborhood
schools" in our brief.

.And I am not appearing for such a conception of the
neighborhood school.
As the President said in his statement of March 24,

22

1970, "While the dual school system is the most obvious example,

23

de jure segregation is also found in more subtle forms.

24

authorities have

And. in the same statement, the President said, in

6

referring to executive action, "The neighborhood school will be

7

deemed the most appropriate base for such a system."

8

9

Note that he said "base."

He did not mean that it

was the sole method or the sole requirement.

Many methods are

10

available and are evidenced in the record of these cases, which

11

will serve to eliminate or minimize the consequences of past

12

official conduct.

13

Thus there can be truly impartial zones.

There can

14

be pairing of schools.

15

the smaller communities which previously had dual systems with

16

two schools.

17

black school and a white school, it is easy to eliminate the

18

dual school system by saying one school will take grades 1 to

19

4, the other school will take grades 5 to 8.

20

And this is particularly relevant in

That was true of New Kent County—you have a

And there can be satellite pairing when the

And, of course, there must be proper allocation of
faculty and there must be elimination of discrimination in

i

1

bussing and in athletics and activities.

2

All of these things can be done and should be done

3

as far as feasible in order to eliminate the consequences of

4

past discrimination.

5

School boards are making decisions all the time.

6

They will not have done enough if they simply establish proper­

7

ly designated neighborhood schools.

8

18

All of these things must be properly

Now, turning to another matter, there has been some

19

reference in these arguments to the Civil Rights Act of 1964

20

and the provisions that Congress included there with respect

21

to bussing.

22

section specifically authorises the Attorney General to insti­

23

tute for, or in the name of, the United Statas a civil action

24

for a relief, and then it goes on and says that "provided that

25

nothing herein"—the key word of that provision, "nothing

What was in Section 407A of that Act, and the

41

1

herein'8—"shall empower any official or court of the United

2

States to require bussing to achieve racial balance»"

3

Well, this is not a suit by the Attorney General

4

under Section 407A.

There is no provision in that statute, or

5

in any other statute, because somewhat similar things have been

6

enacted as riders on HEW appropriation acts, which takes away

7

any powers which the courts otherwise have.

8

does is to make it plain that that statute does not add to any

9

authorities which the courts might otherwise have.

10

Or, let me put it another way.

All this statute

It makes it plain

11

that Congress is not, under that statute, making an enactment

12

under Section 4 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which requires

13
14
15
16
17

18
19

20
21

or specifically authorises, that that kind of bussing be done.
I think that this statutory action, both here and in
the appropriation acts, is relevant simply because it indicates
that Congress has not sought an extension to require bussing
to achieve racial balance which, in my opinion, though it is
not here and I haven’t fully considered it and it isn’t briefed,
but in my opinion is now advised, Congress could, in exercising
its power under Section 4 of the Fourteenth Amendment.
All that I think that statutory language means is
r

22
23
24
25

that Congress has net exercized such power.
Q

You don’t think that, under that supplemental

clausa, the Court could do -that, do you?
A

I think, Mr. Justice, that a Court can require
42

'!

|

1

bussing where it is needed in order to provide the remedy to

2

disestablish the present consequences of past discrimination.
Q

3
4

Well, X don't understand you to put that on the

same level as the powers of Congress, do 1?
A

5

No, Mr. Justice, I don't.

That is simply a

6

question of the Court fashioning a remedy to meet the right

7

which it has established in the Brown case and several subse­

8

quent decisions, the right not to be discriminated against,

9

and that includes not only present enactments but the applica­

10

tion of present official decisions to fact circumstances which

11

arose out of past situations.
Q

12

How far past?

I am thinking, for example, of

tate of Ohio which, up until about 90 years ago, allowed

13

my

14

school boards to maintain and conduct segregated schools, ex­

13

plicitly allowed that.

16

statute and took away the power of school boards to maintain

17

segregated schools, but I am sure there may be a good many

18

vestiges of that former official policy.

19

A

About 90 years ago Ohio repealed that

Mr. Justice, I would find it hard to answer that

20

question without knowing more about the facts, knowing how

21

persistent the consequences had been.

22

23

Q

I would think the chance-i

Certainly in the big cities of Ohio, as in the

24

big cities of any other State that I am familiar with, there

25

are neighborhood residential patterns v?hich reflect racial
43

separation»
1

A

I don't know how far back, Mr. Justice.

I

2
think if it can be shown that the effect of past discrimination
3

persists to any substantial extent, then that is relevant.
4

Q

But this question would raise a question as to

5
whether or not restrictive covenants in housing practices are
6
also in the category of de jure.
7
A

If does.

Q

Which is not in this case.

8

9
A

It certainly is in the Charlotte case and I be­

10

lieve it is in the Mobile case.
11

Q

436.

When you have a statute segregating the

12

schools by races, it is hard to determine how much restrictive
13

covenants -—

attenuated, just as the historical instance of Justice Stewart
has given.

21

22
23
24

If you had only those and no more, the Court might

say well, there is the stream of history, and you get eddies
and swirls and not much of it is left.

19

20

I think that some of those things are somewhat

But I think it is something that has to be consid­
ered and evaluated and passed upon.

I don't say that the mere

existence of it alone is a sufficient basis for a present remedy.
How, there are a couple of other points to which I
should like to refer.

You mean if there was no history of a compulsori?

Q

The State of Washington.

10

11

I thought

you meant the District of Columbia.
Q

If they had shown on the record a pattern of

restrictive covenants, produced these ghettoes, would you -think
that would be de jure segregation?
A

Well, Mr. Justice, if it could be shown that

12

schools had been specifically located to deal with particular

13

groups and for that purpose, I think there might be something

14

which would provide a basis for a remedy.

facto, but because it was discrimination?
A

Mr. Justice, it would be de jure because the

decision to place the school there was the State action.
Q

--- the central reason be that it was discri­

minatory action?

21

A

All right, Mr. Justice.

22

Q

On account of race.

23

A

24
25

It was discriminatory action on account of

race, the effects of which may still persist.
Wow, I would like, in the short time revaaining, to

45

1

make reference to two further factors to which very little

2

reference has been made here, which seem to me to be very im­

3

portant .

4

The first is the problem of resegregation.

A great

5

deal of effort has been expended in trying to desegregate

6

schools in many parts of the country, North and South, and it

7

is constantly disrupted because of movements of population and

8

withdrawals from schools, going into private schools, of which,

9

I suppose, the District of Columbia is the clearest and most

10
11

familiar example»
Mr. Greenberg said yesterday that, under his plan,

12

in three years everything would be straightened out.

13

guarantee that it won't be.

14

in any city there will be shifts and adjustments and it will

15

have to be -- -

16

I can

Under his plan, under any plan,

One of the problems, it seems to me, in this area is

17

not to require too much.

If you require too much, you aggra­

18

vate the problems of movement and withdrawal.

19

a system which provides a good deal cf elimination of past

20

discrimination and provides some hope that it might be rea­

21

sonably stable, you may achieve a great deal more in tha long

22

run than if you adopt, the standard which counsel for the

23

petitioner has advanced.

If you set up

There is another aspect to the problem which is —

I would like t© pursue that for a moment, the

resegregation matter.

2

ment, have you arrived at any rules of thumb or even more com­

3

plicated rules as to what promotes or hinders resegregation?

4

Is there a tipping point that you read about in the briefs or

5

some literature, or not?

A

Mr, Justice, they talk about it. and I am not

qualified to respond to the question»

Q

Mr* Greenberg or .Mr. Nabrit yesterday suggested

that Judge MacMillan had in mind this problem in the remedy

I am not qualified to

I would think that, if preventing resegregafcion

20

is a consideration in devising a remedy, why you must have some

21

basis for fashioning that remedy.

22

A

I have no doubt, Mr* Justice, that there is a

23

tipping point.

What I am not qualified to say is where it is.

24

I suspect that it varies widely according to the circumstances,

25

including the opportunities to get out, either through moving
47

1

to other parts of the city or the use of private schools»

2

I would like to make reference to one other thing,

3

which is black separatism, something that we have only begun

4

to learn about in recent times and which many of us did not

5

foresee.

6

But it is far from clear’ how far all of the people

7

represented by the petitioners here want to have what they

8

seek for them.

9

good.

Maybe they ought to have it, maybe it would be

10

Certainly, in my view, the public should facilitate

11

their getting it whenever they want it, but it isn't clear to

12

me that children should be forced into schools, that black

13

children should be forced into schools that they don't want to

14

go to.

15

I encountered this first in connection with predomi­

16

nantly black law schools.

17

of Howard University here, which, I suppose, everyone has the

18

strongest feelings that it should be supported, the United

19

Negro College Fund, and other such things . There still remains

20

a problem as to how far black people should be forced into

21

these matters.

22

And we have, of course, the example

And so I conclude that the judgement below in this

case should be affirmed as an experiment.

3

Q

Do I understand you to say, Mr. Solicitor Gen­

4

eral , that objecting Negro children should be given the privi­

5

lege of opting out?
A

6

No, Mr. Justice, I didn't quite say that.

I

7

didn’t say that at all.

I just said that in evaluating the

8

standard or the objective which is to be reached, that this is

9

one of the factors, one of the intangible unmeasurable factors,

10

like the problem of resegregation, that the District Courts

11

surely ought to take into account.

12

that this Court has to recognize it in some way.
Q

13

And, if so, it seems to me

What is the position of the United States as to

14

whether or not objecting Negroes or objecting whites should be

15

able to opt out?
A

18

Mr. Justice, I think it is quite plain that

17

when the plan is established, when it is adopted, there should

18

be no opting out, except the majority-to-minority transfer

19

which we have provided for.
What I am talking about, is what kind of a plan should

here.

14

My client

I am advised by the Clerk that I have 45 minutes

15

time for argument, but I must share this with another respon­

16

dent, the Parent-Teacher Association, so I will attempt to

17

limit my argument to not more than 30 minutes.

Q

May I ask you, are you supporting or defending

the judgement?

20

A

Your honor, we ask that the judgement be over-

21

of a new plan in the light of certain principles that we hope

23

the Court would reaffirm.

25

and sent back to the District Court for the formulation

Although I am pressed for time to present my own
argument, several assertions made by the petitioner yesterday
50

1

should not go unanswered, so I will rejoin just briefly.

2

Petitioner stated that the school board has changed

3

its pupil-assignment plan from year to year and sometimes more

4

frequently.

5

May 1 remind the Court that, since August of 1966,

6

this school system has each year received an order of the Court1;

7

requiring a new or changed desegregation plan, that since 1967 ,

8

the student assignment portions of these plans have been de­

9

vised by someone other than the school board, either the District Court, the Court of Appeals, HEW, or the Department of

l

Justice.

'

10
11

12

Since 1970 we have been ordered to implement--since

13

January of 1970—six different plans for student assignment

14

in the desegregation process.

15

It is not the board that has been changing the plan.

Let me be sure I understand you.

8

Q

Which one is in effect, now?

9

A

A combination plan -that involves elements of

10

a plan developed by HEW, modified by the Justice Department,

11

ordered by the Court of Appeals, modified by the District

12

Court, and remodified by the Court of Appeals.
Petitioner has framed his argument essentially in

13
14

terms of results, not the Constitution, but results.

15

me show you something of results.

So let

Osheo Road 80% black, at one time an all-white

Palmer, at one time an all-white school, now listed
Glendale, at one time an all-

The same pattern goes throughout.

Thomas, 62% white,

once an all-black school.
Q

Where is Interstate 65?
52

That is the divider?

1

2

A

That is the divider.

G

And in terms of residential pattern, — show

3

what the racial makeup is of those who live east of that divi­

4

der, those who live west of that divider, in Mobile?

5
6

A

I think east of the divider it is roughly 60%

black, 40% white.

West .roughly 70% whits, 30% black.

7

So this is seme of the results, if we wish to frame

8

things in terras of results, rather than in terms of complying

9

with the constitutional mandate.

10

Now, let us turn for a moment to another question

11

that was raised, and that is the question of the effects of past

12

discrimination.

13

Petitioner relies heavily on the fact, that bussing to

14

preserve segregation occurred in the past, and this is freely

15

admitted in the brief.

16

where students, for example, in this area, which is in the

17

rural area--and 1 might remind the Court that -this is a map of

18

metropolitan Mobile, Pritchard, and Chickasaw, three cities

19

with coterminous boundary lines.

20

They point to examples of bussing

This is roughly 18 miles from north to south arid 13

21

22

north to south, and 27 miles east to west, from 'the river to

23

24
25

Tha county itself is 53 miles from

With, reference to the bussing, students carried from

53

1

ago into this school,, unquestionably this occurred.

2

students are no longer bussed and have not been bussed for

3

four or five years.

4

But these

How can it be contended that there is any effect

5

left from the dual system as the result of bussing thirty stu­

6

dents from here to here five years ago?

7
8

Certainly it was in effect at the time, but we are
dealing with a presently existing effect of a once dual system.

9

The same thing occurs with reference to split cones

10

or non-contiguous zones that petitioner referred to yesterday

11

with reference to the Whistler and Thomas schools, indicating

12

the fact that Thomas, an all-Negro school, Whistler, an all-

13

white school, and people from this area, where, at the time,

14

there was no school, went past the Thomas school to -the Whist­

15

ler school.

16

There again, this occurred four or five years ago.

17

Where can there be any present existing effect from this, as

18

it exists now, when you consider that Thomas, which was once

19

an all-Negro school, is now 62% white and has been for two

20

school terms, predominantly white?

21

one time all-white, is now 52% white, although last year it

22

was predominantly Negro?

23

And Whistler, which was at

Petitioner has stated that Mobile has never adhered

24

to the neighborhood, school concept.

54

This is incorrect.

And

ii

1

General with reference to the cliches or seising upon words,

2

such as the neighborhood school concept.
As the record will show, the Mobile school system

3
4

has always adhered to and favored the neighborhood school

5

concept, based upon specific geographic zones, except when

6

ordered by the Court to do otherwise.
Admittedly, prior to the disestablishment of the dual

7
8

school system, at one tiiae there existed the dual zones, over­

9

lapping zones, one zone for blacks, one zone for whites,

10

superimposed upon on® another.

This has been disestablished

11

and was disestablished as much as four years ago by the simple

12

elimination of both zones, redrawing a zone around each school,

13

a unitary zone, so that every person, black or white, goes to

14

the school in the zone, regardless of the present or past

15

racial makeup of the school.
Admittedly, prior to the disestablishment of the dual

16

system, there were these overlapping zones, but they no longer

exist.

Admittedly, several years after the freedom of
choice concept, which was foreign to the Mobile school system,
came upon the public scans, the board, through public pressure,
55

1

was forced into asking the Court for freedom of choice.

2

we have never had freedom of choice in the Mobile public school

system except when it was specifically requested by motion of

belt line of Federal Interstate highway.

The zone is rather

No matter how far you extend this zone, this is a

15

predominantly black school, an all-black school, as listed by

Mr. Greenberg.

This was once an all-white school, but it is

17

now all-black.

And this school, which was once all-white, but

18

it is 67% white now, so it is hemmed in by the belt line on

one side and essentially by all-black areas on the other.

three-cornered —-- of these zones.

2

in grades 1 and 2 frora all three zones to one of these schools.

3

That means bussing 15 miles from here to here and 9 miles from

4

here to here.
They send ever;/ student in grades 3 and 4 from all

5

6

three zones to thi3 school.
Q

7

8

They send every student

Does that mean sending some of the blacks on a

13-mile drive away from schools that are close to them?
A

Your honor, it means sending both blacks and

11

Q

Well, I was going to ask about whites, too.

12

It means sending both.

9
10

whites.

A

13
14
15
16
17

20
21

22
23
24

25

If there are blacks and whites in

this zone, and there are—there are 45 black students, along
with 500-odd white students in this school—you arbitrarily
take every first and second grader in this school, black or
white, and bus them up here to this school.
Q

18
19

Yes, sir.

I assume that there are some people who .live in

that vicinity who have children of different ages, of different
grades?
A

I think that is a fair assumption.

Q

And that would separate the children?

A

Yes, sir.

Q

So that one of them would have to go to a school

13 miles away and another to one close to him?
63

1

A

Of necessity it would.

In this case there is

2

a three-cornered pairing, three schools.

3

would perhaps go here, the third grader would go 13 miles by

4

bus here, the

5

6

The first grader

fifth grader would go 9 miles by bus here.

Most of the pairing is of two schools, but there are
two or three instances of three-cornered pairing.

7

Now, some of this plan that HEW has proposed to deal

8

with this problem, defies reason.

9

of that.

I will give you an example

10

The -- and Whistler schools.

11

Q

Is Whistler a part of Mobile?

12

A

Yes, sir.

14

Q

It was a different city, wasn't it?

15

A

Yes, sir.

17

Q

It is in what you call Greater Mobile?

18

A

Metropolitan Mobile which includes the city of

19

It was a separate community at one

time.

It is in the city of Pritchard at

this time.

Mobile, the city of Pritchard, and the city of Chickasaw.

23

schools.

24

or school; Whistler was once an all-white school.

25

It is roughly 9 miles between the two ;
i
Willma, or Will, was once an all-white school zone,

The enrollment now at Will is 652 white and 160 black.
64

II

1

The enrollment at Whistler is 227 white and 160 black.

2

schools have 160 black students, one with 227 whites and one

3

with 652 whites.

Both

4

And yet you are bussing back and forth.

5

Q

Is that in the Court's order that you attack

A

No, sir, it is in Plan B-X Alternative drawn

6

it?

7

8

by HEW which petitioner is urging.
Q

9
10

Court you are attacking?
A

11

12

No, sir.

But this is what the petitioner has

asked pendente lite.
Q

13
14

That is not required by the judgement of the

Mr. Philips, are those the lines that the

school board drew?

15

A

No, sir, these are the lines that HEW drew.

16

Q

No, I mean the district lines, the zone lines,

17

they are not yours?

18

A

No, sir.

That is what HEW drew.

Another ex­

19

ample of this is Thomas and Whittley.

20

Whittley.

21

Thomas now has 74 black students and 160 white; Whittley has

22

345 black students and 127 white.

23
24

25

Here is Thomas, and

Both of these were at one time all-Negro schools.

Q

If you should win, would that condition continue

with reference to the personnel of the school?
A

Yes, sir.

Of course, we ask that it be sent
65

1

back to the District Court for formulation of a plan in light

2

of certain principles which we hope would eliminate some very

3

grossly gerrymandered zones.

4

a later portion of the argument, but I may not.

That I may be able to get to in

I would like now to respond to a question that has

5

6

been raised a couple of times by the Chief Justice and by oth­

7

ers, and that is with reference to the necessity of the Court

8

to continue to balance schools, once we move to a purely result-

9

oriented constitutional theory.
And I suggest to you this.

10

Absent the power of the

11

Court to force people to attend public school—and I might men­

12

tion to you that there is no applicable requirement that, by

13

law, that a student attend school in Mobile, Alabama, no com­

14

pulsory attendance law—absent the power of the Court to force

15

people to attend public school and absent the power of the

16

Court to restrict all people, black or white, rich or poor, in

17

the movement of their residence, then the Court will forever

18

and eternally be in the business and process of balancing.

19

The balancing process can never end.

20

What better example of this can I give you than the

21

supplemental brief filed by petitioner the day before yester­

22

day?

23

to set out the students assigned by the Court order that is

24

here attacked.

25

I am quoting—"11,894 black elementary students in metropolitan

I quote from the report in the brief

where they purport

The report shows that there are 11,894—and

66

j

Mobile.

2

is 64%."

3

The percentage of those assigned to all-black schools

Then they proceed to list these enrollment figures.

4

They do not draw the distinction between those assigned by the

5

Court and those actually enrolled.

6

those enrolled, not those assigned by the Court as a conse­

7

quence of the Court order.
And so we get back to the figures I have quoted be­

8
9

The figures they quote are

fore of Blount High School where the Court assigned 1233 blacks,

10

104.1 whites.

And it comes out an all-black school, with 41

11

whites enrolled and 2033 blacks enrolled.
Or Washington Junior High School where the Court as­

12
13

signed 780 blacks, 636 whites.

14

whites enrolled.

There are 809 blacks and 59

15

And the same thing appears throughout.

16

When this litigation first began in 3963, as I des­

17

cribed, there is no question but what we had a dual school

18

system.

But this dual school system has been disestablished.

19

In 1967, after a full evidentiary hearing, the Dis­

20

trict Court in an exhaustive opinion and finding of fact, af­

21

ter hearings spanning some four weeks, found and stated that

22

the dual system had been disestablished in every particular

23

described by the Courts, except the element of faculty and

24

student assignment.

25

There has been no finding to the contrary by any
67

1

Court since that time—and that covers transportation, athle­

2

tics, extracurricular activities, facilities, activities and

3

programs.

4

5
6

This finding was reconfirmed as late as the June 8
1970 opinion of the Court of Appeals.
The two areas labelled as deficient by the District

7

Court in 1967, faculty assignment and student assignment,

8

these have since been rectified.

Faculty by the assignment of teachers so as to create
a bi-racial faculty in every school in the system but two,
two years ago, in every school in the system but one, last
year—and that one, I might mention, is a school isolated on
Dolphin Island in the Gulf of Mexico with 20 white students in
the school.
Q

And only one teacher?

A

And only one teacher.

Q

It could hardly have abi-racialfaculty.

A

I hardly think so.

This year, of course, in

order to comply with the order of the Court, which requires a
60-40 racial balance in every school in the system among facul­
ty, the personnel department has been engaged in a tragicomic
game of fruit-basket turnover in order to try to meet this
requirement of 60% white faculty and 40% black faculty in
every school in the system.
But we have come up to the terms of the order, give

25
68

1

or take a few, and in our brief I listed the actual faculty

2

assignments for the year, including the number of assignments

3

yet to be made in order to reach the ratio.
Q

4

Mr. Philips, I hope it doesn't interrupt your

5

chain of argument, but I am concerned about these missing stu­

6

dents, 1000 in the one school, the all but 59 out of 636 in

7

another.

8

A

Yes, sir.

9

Q

Has anyone made any inquiry as to whether or not

10

they are just drop-outs, since you say there is no school com­

11

pulsory attendance, or whether they moved out of the district

12

or how many went to private schools, or what.

13

pursued as part of the record?

14

A

Yes, sir.

Well, it is not in the record, be­

15

cause it has come so late, you see.

16

17

Q

Has that been

The enrollment figures

Could the record be supplemented readily to dis­

close what happened to these people
A

It will disclose within reason, because we won't

20

be able to locate each one, but we know where many of them are.

21

For example, if you total up the difference between the assign­

22

ed students, assigned by the Court order, and those enrolled,

23
24
25

you come to a total of approximately 2000 or 2500, as I recall.
I may be wrong in my figure, I think it is around 2500.
The total enrollment is down from last year over
69

1

4000, so we know, within reason, that many of these missing

2

students are within this 4000, simply did not re-enroll in

Your honor, I think it runs close to the pro­

5

portion of white and black students in the system, approximately

6

60% white and 40% black—I think the transfers run as much as

7

80% white and 20% black, but I would not wish to be held to

that figure, because this is just my recollection.

at Central Junior High School, the zone is a long, narrow zone

running diagonally, from northeast to southwest.
Central Junior High School, which is right here,

was once a high school but by the Court was this year reduced

21

to a junior high school.
The two other junior high schools near the tip of

the zone, Haynes and Hall, both are integrated junior high
schools.
Students down here at the tip of the zone are within

72

They are roughly 4 miles

from Central diagonally across the heaviest traffic part of the

city of Mobile, this being the central city of Mobile lying on

the river.
Many of these students that are not going to school—

ARGUMENT OF

STOCKMAN

2

IN BEHALF OF THE MOBILE COUNTY PARENT-TEACHER

3

ASSOCIATION

4

MR. STOCKMAN:

May it please the Court:

Mr. Chief

5

Justice, your honors, I present an argument on behalf of the

6

respondents, Mobile County Council PTA, which is an association

7

of the PTA associations of the various schools in the system.

8
9

The PTA got into this case as an intervenor—I think
Mr. Philip’s statement in the record in this case will indicate

to

the problem that the PTA, or the members, the parents, the

11

teachers and the students were faced with.

12

The number of changes that we had seen in the last

13

few months is absolutely devastating.

14

of us in this courtroom could live with the changes which these

15
16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

people have had to face.

I don't think any one

And each one was highly publicized in

the newspaper because that was part of the order.
When the District Court made a change it was publi­
cized and each of the parents get ready—I have one child over
here and one over here and one over here.

Next month, next

week sometimes, there would be a revision either by the Distric:
Court or by the Court of Appeals.
-- I think basically we were concerned with the fact
that the people in Mobile wanted the neighborhood concept, they
wanted neighborhood schools, they wanted convenience.
Q

What do you mean by neighborhood schools?
74

1

A

By neighborhood schools, we are talking about

2

communities.

3

I would like to reiterate just a couple of points, that the

4

concentration of the colored or black population lies right in

5

this area, with a few in here.

6

Mobile, as Mr. Philips may have pointed out, and

Now, this is a densely populated black area.

Mobile

7

is a. rather large city, or the metropolitan area is rather

8

large, 155 square miles in the city itself.

9

concentration—and another thing that makes it more difficult,

But all of the

10

is the fact that on this side, you will see this water, this

11

is nothing but marshland and ——, there is only one tunnel

12

going under the river to B—-- County, and then up here there

13

is this one bridge.

14

sical impossibility.

I mean, this is just a demarcation, phy­

And nestled against the bank of all this water is

15
16

the black community, you see.

17

the county, is located to the west and to the north and to the

18

south.

19

case, which had the community nestled in the middle where you

20

could go out inttwo directions or four directions at least.

21

And all the rest of the city,

So the difficult problem is not even like the Charlotte

In addition to that, since we are on the junior high

22

level, you can see why Washington, and I don't know whether

23

you Justices can see it well, but I will get it up a little

24

higher—this zone right here is the Washington zone, which Mr.

25

Philips and Mr. Greenberg have both discussed the fact that
75

1

people didn’t c?ven attend.

2

way up here in a predominantly colored neighborhood.

3

will notice right here, this large pocket of students here

4

that previously vrent to one of these other schools either

5

right across here a few blocks or here a few blocks, now tra­

6

vel as much as 12 in the arteries to get there, impossible.

But you will see the school sitting
And you

7

Q

How far?

8

A

Some of them 12, 15 miles, just around streets

9

to get there, in heavy traffic at the time of day which is

10

impossible.

It

lem-- I say simple problem, it is very complex—well, I think

12

there comes a time when we are going to have to face up to the

13

real issue, whether or not the constitutional right of the in­

14

dividual, who has any constitutional right at all to determine

15

where he goes to school, maybe that is oversimplified, but I

16

think the real issue -Q

17
18

I think this Court is faced with one simple prob­

Mr. Stock

, do you consider a junior high

school a neighborhood school?
A

19

I would think that in the context of my client,

20

the Parent-Teacher Association, every school is a neighborhood

21

school.
Q

22

Every school?

In a city that has one high schooL,

23

the high school is a neighborhood school?

24

certainly.

25

A

You don't mean that

I mean it from the standpoint of my client.
76

1

When I say that, simply this, Mr. Justice Marshall, is that

2

every parent feels an obligation to participate in the educa­

3

tional institution which his child attends.

4

obligation that you feel in Mobile I guess just as much as you

5

feel in any other community.

6

And this is an

They feel an obligation to participate as a community

7

in every school, no matter which school it is, whether it is

8

bi-racial or not, they participate in the activities.

9

And the tragedy of the whole thing is, as Mr. Gris­

10

wold pointed out, is that these people, some of them, we are

11

losing out of the schools. Mobile is losing to private schools

12

and otherwise, some of the people who are leaders, the parents

13

who would otherwise be leaders and instruments in causing these

14

schools to become a part of the community.

15

Even an underprivileged child, under the -- of the

16

PTA Council in a given school, receives many benefits from the

17

Council itself, or from the PTA itself, because of the fact

18

that it makes the people more interested or more instrumental

19

in the schools.

20

*

If we take the issue that is squarely before the

21

Court, as I see it in this case, it is not the issue of whe­

22

ther a child is bussed one mile, or two miles, or four miles,

23

or twenty miles.

24

right of the individual to be compelled to attend any particular

25

school solely on the basis of race.

The issue is the fundamental constitutional

We need know nothing else but one thing to make as­

2

signments under the plan sought by the petitioner, that is,

the race of the child.

Without that, we cannot.

impossibility to condemn, put children in school under the plan

proposed by the petitioners.

ARGUMENT OF JACK GREENBERG, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF DAVIS ET AL.
i

MR. GREENBERG:

3

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please 1
{
There has indeed been a great deal of confusion in i

4

the Court:

w

Mobile, and that confusion has stemmed, in considerable part,
I

/>*.

from the fact that Judge Thomas has not given hearings at any

7

of these plans for a period of two years.

8
9

And, as an example, I would like to point to the ques-f
tion of the missing students.

One reason why there are some

10

missing students is there has been a loss of population of ap­

11

proximately 17,000 over the past few years in Mobile because of

12

the closing of the B--- Air Force Base.

13

But another reason is is that there is something down

14

there known as non-conformers, children going to school as they

15

please, where they please, in violation of the Court order.

16
17
18

j

I

Mr. Cooper and I went in to see Judge Thomas about
two weeks ago to get a hearing on the non-conformers, and he
said he would set it for some time in November.

We pointed out

19

ti
that we thought there was some urgency to setting it, and set- j

20

ting it soon, because school was going on now, and he said he

21

i

l

would set it in November and if we disagreed we could go to the!
r

Fifth Circuit.

t

That is why we have had confusion in Mobile and why
it is very difficult to understand what is going on.
Mr. Greenberg, is there an answer to why some

!
i

1

800 more blacks, for example, are in Blount than were assigned

2

there?

3

A

Well, there have been wholesale transfers of

4

students, again in violation of the order, and only last week

5

the Justice Department was able to get a hearing before Judge

6

Thomas and get a temporary restraining order against that.

7

But it may be partly wholesale transfers, it may be

8

partly non-conformers.

9

Q

Voluntary transfers or involuntary transfers?

10

A

These are voluntary transfers granted in vio­

11

lation of where the assignments ought to be under the order.

12

Now, Alternative B-l, contrary to what Mr. Philips

13

and Mr. Stockman said, is not a plan we are

There has

However, it is a general notion of the kind of thing

17

that can be done if one wants to assign students according to

18

normal systems of school administration in Mobile, and end up

19

with an integrated system.

20

Q

Before you leave the question Justice Brennan

21

was putting to you, you said there were 800 Negro pupils more

22

than were assigned to the school, and I want to get a little

23

bit clearer picture of what is the explanation for it.

24

A

I don't know.

25

Q

Was some of it voluntary and some of it not?
81

1

2

A

I don't know, Mr» Chief Justice, we have been

unable to get a hearing.

3

Q

Could any of them be there involuntarily?

4

A

Well, the answer is I just don't know.

The

5

thing that we have focussed on mostly is, first of all, whole­

6

If they are involuntary, we don’t know whether or not

conformers, children going to school without official assign­

ment, just attending schools, and v/e have not been able to get

12

a hearing.

13

can ascribe a good deal of it to what I have just said.

14

16

And indeed there is confusion down there, but I

Q

Judge Thomas has not given you a hearing, any

hearing at all at any time?
A

There have been hearings at various times.

The

17

plan that is in effect was put in following a pre-trial con­

18

ference, but a trial was never held.

19

by Judge Thomas, without a hearing.

20

It was just put right in

At an earlier stage v/e made a motion to the Court

21

that, had this thing not occurred several times, saying that

22

we would like a procedure set down for filing objections and

23

papers and having a hearing, and it was denied.

24
25

And that is all set forth in our brief and it is in
the record.
82

1

May it please the Court:

Despite the considerable

2

disagreement over the matter discussed in the last moment or

3

two, there has been, nevertheless, a remarkable amount of

4

agreement among the parties and the courts below, with the ex­

5

ception of the Moore plaintiffs, who feel that nothing at all

6

ought to be done, and the respondents in this case, who have

7

not addressed themselves to the question of what ought to be

8

done—everyone appears to agree that race can and must be taken

9

into account to undo the effects of a de jure segregated school

he feels it is appropriate, building schools, closing schools.

The Charlotte school board believes it can gerrymander in the

Now, I would say in further response to the Chief

Justice's question of yesterday, which was essentially when

can the Federal Courts get out of this business, that the
Federal Courts will get out of this business as soon as the
results are achieved, when an identifiable clear test is
decided upon, and people know what they have to do, where,
in Mobile, as an extreme example, they haven't had the slight­
est idea.
Q

Now, you said a moment ago that it seemed to

be agreed that race could be taken into account in the dis­
mantling of a dual system.
Now, one of the complaints made with respect to
Judge MacMillan's order, which we are not revealing now but it
would perhaps relate to others, is that 71-29 ratio mechanic­
ally applied is doing more than taking it into account.

23

A

I don't believe he did that, Mr. Chief Justice.

24

Q

I am not suggesting he did precisely, but I

25

am saying that if you had 71-29 and then applied that rigidly,

84

1

you certainly would be doing more than taking it into account,

2

wouldn't you?

3

A

We would not urge that.

4

Q

Wouldn't you think, Mr. Greenberg, that a 71-29

We do not urge that.

6

districts that would go some 80-20, some 60-40?
A

be satisfied.
Q

10

I think certainly that in many cases that would

How large a variation from the precise 71-29

pattern do you think is tolerable?
A

11

I would then have to look at the workability

12

test.

In one aspect of that, at the general distribution of

13

population of the community.

14

MacMillan handled it quite pragmatically, he had a 4% school,

15

and he had a 40% school.

16

We don't.

In another aspect—I think Judge

He did not insist upon a rigid ratio.

17

But just as in the jury case which had been spoken

18

about, which I think are really not appropriate in many res-

19

pects, the universe is larger, you are not dealing with 12

20

people, you are dealing with 900 people.

21

numbers to get some idea as to whether or not there has been

22

too wide a deviation.

23
24

It is impossible to come to a judgement without loo- i
i
king at the numbers. In a 90-10 it would be one thing, in a

25

50-50 district it would have to be another.

*

85

You do look at the

You can't avoid

looking at the numbers.
Q

If there isn’t some room left, some substantial

3

room left for play in the joints, you are bound to have a con­

4

stant problem of reapportionment, aren't you?

5

A

You are entirely right, Mr. Chief Justice, and

6

Judge Johnson in --- v. Montgomery County Board of Education

7

case, which was reversed by the Fifth Circuit, which was in

8

turn reversed by this Court and Judge Johnson's orders rein­

9

stated, he set up a ratio, I think it was a 60-40 ratio, if

10

I recall correctly, and allowed a 15% deviation, because he

11

needed something he could administer.

12

When he was talking to the school district there in

13

terms of generalities and not in terms of results, it just

14

didn't work.

15

then had something that was clear, they had an order they could

16

follow, and, as far as I can tell, it has worked very well,

17

not only there, but in hundreds of districts around the country

18

When he had something he could administer, he

May it please the Court:

Sixteen years have passed

19

since the first Brown decision was handed down by this Court,

20

and in Mobile, as in hundreds of cities and towns across the

21

south, black children born in the year of that decision have

22

completed their entire public school career without ever at­

23

tending a segregated school.

24

The record of district-by-district resistance to the

25

Constitution is well-known to this Court and I will not repeat
86

i

it here, but I do urge upon this Court now, in 1970, as it

2

last begins to appear that more than a decade and a half of li­

3

tigation is bearing in desegregation decrees, whether litigated
'

4

or consented to, it is essential to the integrity of our legal

5

structure and to the faith—Mr. Griswold spoke about black

6

separatism—-I mean the faith that the effectiveness of the re­

7

medy fashioned by a District Court comport with the momentous

8

nature of the constitutional right which is to be assured.
