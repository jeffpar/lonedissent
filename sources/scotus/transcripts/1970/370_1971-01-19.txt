CONTINUATION OF ARGUMENT BY

LOUIS CHANDLER, ESQ.

9

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

10
11

MR. LOUIS CHANDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court.

12

With reference to the question posed by Mr. Justice

13

White, I would like to quote Judge Kaufman in the Pepsi Cola

14

decision as to the requirements of the Courts consideration of

15

the record and the Boards findings under Section 10.
He states in an unfair practice proceedings"The Board

16

17

cannot completely abdicate its responsibility toa a regional

18

director,

19

to consideration by the Senate, as are those of Board members.

20

Moreover, the Boards experience is particularly relevant and

21

desirable in deciding complex issues relating to the appropriate

22

bargaining unit before the petent sanctions arising from the

23

finding of an unfair la^or practice are invoked, '"here the

24

cbmice is between tits© (fairly conflicting views the Court must

25

defer to the Boards decision, but here the Board has not actual-

a functionary whose appointment is not even subject

18
1

1

ly considered the questions of fact and law; the Board has

z

merely rubber stamped its decision and thus the Regional Directs

3

decision was perpetuated even though it may have been in fact

4

wrong, and we, too, would be blindly endorsing the questionable

5

result» Such defference to the Regional Director, was not in­

6

tended by Congress.

7

It decided that the Board itself must rule whether the

8

litigant has committed an unfair labor practice, we see no

9

basis for thus mutilating the legislative scheme.8'

10

And Judge

Butzer, in Clement White, said, in a case

II

which also involved the use of summary judgement, that the use

12

of summary judgement in deciding whether an employer had com-

13

remitted an unfair labor practice does not exempt the Board from

14

complying with the Administrative Procedure Act. And the Boards

15

earlier consideration of the companies request for review of

16

the Regional Directors decision does not supply the deficiency

1?

for then the Board, as in the Magnesium case, simply denied the

18

request with the, and that was my interpolation, simply denied

19

the request with the observation that it raised no substantial

20

issues, warranting review.
The Board is charged teith the duty of stating the

21

22

reasons why the Board concluded thattthe facts showed a violation

23

of law, no statutory exception to this rule exists because

24

critical elements of the eontriversy were determined preliminar­

25

ily by the Regional Director: in the representation procedings,
2

19

t

the Board, not the Regional Director, has the responsibility of

z

deciding complaints of unfair labor practices»

3

Q

HOw much of your case, Mr» Chandler, depends

4

upon theexamination by this Court of your newly discovered ev­

3

idence claimed

6

A

in its context?
I think a substantial portion of it would because

7

the Regional Director based his decision substantially on the

0

evidence testimony given by the witness who subsequently stated,

0

admitted-Q

10

Would you agree that it would ordinarily take

11

& very strong showing on an issue of that kind which is pro­

12

tection of the newly discovered evidence claim to engage the

13

attention of this Court?
A

H

I think the fact that he admitted that he had

15

witheld information at the hearing before the Regional Director

16

would be that kind of strong evidence.

11

Now Judge Kaufman—

18

Q

Mr. Chandler, if we bring you back to the quest­

19

ion I asked as we closed last night, I didn't sense an. answer

20

to it in the material that you read at length just now. Is it

21

your position that when the Board does not formally review the

22

Regional Directors determination that review is forever lost?

23

In the Court of Appeals, for example?

,

A

24
25

Yes, in this sense, Mr. Justice Blackmunip the re­

view must, under Section 10E as it reads, and as £ interpret it.
3

20

t

include a review of the soaxd findings as well as making a deterr

2

mination based upon substantial evidence on the record, and the

3

Board findings are set forth as required in Section 10 C, re­

4

quiring a preponderance of evidence that be used by the Soard

5

in making its determination so that they must be read together»

6

And in an analysis by the Bureau of National Affairs,

7

made of the Administrative Prodedure Act, in 1946^ they have a

8

specific reference to the exceptions to the APA, under a comment

9

in Section 5 which talks about the division of powers between

TiO
ll

the functionaries like the Regional Director and the Board mem­
bers, even on the exceptions»

12

And one exception, if you recall, was that relating to

13

the certification of employee representatives, and in the analy­

14

sis the BNA says, with respect to the excepted matters, the

15

Senate Judiciary Committee emphasizes that administrative ag­

m

encies should not apply the exemption to such cases as tend to

17

be accusatory in form, and involve sharply controverted fac­

18

tual issues , since the prescribed exceptions are not to be

19

interpreted as precluding the statutory procedure under APA,

20

where it is required,

21

And I submit, sir, that Congress did not intend the

22

delays inherent in the Boards refusal independently to review

23

the evidence in an unfair labor practice case, so the parties

24

would feel compelled to take the cases to a circuit court, to

25

secure their first review of all the evidence presented at the

4

21

1

Regional Director level on a substantial rather than a prepon-

2

derance of evidence test, as the statute provides.
Q

3
4

My question, I come back to it, is directed to

whether the issue'is reviewable in the -Court ofAppeals.
A

5

Not on a basis that the law provided for. Con­

6

gress provided that a preponderance of evidence, test could be

7

applied by the Board, that's in Section 10 C.
The Court reviews it on the basis of substantial

8
9

evidence, and they're not reviewing the Boards finding, so that

10

the parties, I submit, are being deprived of their rights under

Ii

the Act, and also, of course, under the provisions of the An-

12

ministrative Aefco

13

And Judge Kaufman, in relying—

n

Q

Apparently, though, you agree that the Court of

15

Appeals will review the Regional Directors determination in

1©

terms of the substantial evidence test?

17

A

Yes, 1 agree withthat. I believe that—-

18

Q

Because the Court did expressly that in this

A

Expressly, and this is what I quarrel with, be-

19

case.

20
21

cuase when Judge Kaufman states that a difficult question was

22

involved and that he was relying oh. the expertise of the Re­

23

gional Director, which is set forth in Record Appendix page

24

205, and states at the last page of his decision that perhaps

25

the Board ruled that it had determined in its own mind that it
5

22

1

was not a fifficult question, X donfc believe that parties should

2

have to rely on a judges speculation

3

Boards action.

4

as to the reason for the

The—
■i

5
6

Q

Was his statement that he was relying on the ex­

pertise of the Regional Director?

7

A

On page 2C5 of the Record Appendix. He so in­

8

dicated, becuase there was no expertise of the Board involved

9

based upon all of the evidence because they refused to look

10

at the evidence., And the Pittsburgh Plate Glass, which is

II

the only case upon which the Board relys, was decided in 1941.

12

And in that case, the Board made its own findings on

13

the. representation- case, after the Board members reviewed the

14

evidence and decided it 5 years before the enactment of the

15

Administrative Procedure Act.

16

;

And as a matter of fact, in 1961, the Board attempted,

IT

by means of the Reorganisation Plan Number 5, to get permission

18

to delegate unfair labor practice cases. And Congress rejected

19
20

this proposal, and the Board should not now be permitted tto
\
accomplish administratively what it could not persuade Congress

21

to do.
A desire to expedite does not give the Board the

22
23

tight to legislate, in a sense, the rights of the parties, or

24

to refuse to consider pertinent and vital newly discovered ev­

23

idence. The Boards so-called ruleaagainst litigation, when ap-

6

23

1

plied in this matter , is directly contrary to Section 10 C

2

of the Act „ and in violation of the Administrative Procedure

3

Act»

4

I would like to call this* honorable Courts attention

„

5

to the case of Electronis Alloys in 183

NLRB 4D, which was

6

also an unfair labor practice case that arose from a refusal

7

to bargain»

8

After the Board refused to review the Regional Dir-

9

ectors decision on an appropriate-—. And the Board stated in

«0

that unfair labor practice case,

1!

judgement, in Respondents response to the notice to show

12

cause,, the Respondent contends that the Board has never in­

13

dependently reviewed the record to determine whether the Re­

14

gional Director was correct in concluding that the unit is

15

appropriate for collective bargaining purposes. We have ex­

16

amined the decision and direction of election in that case, we

17

have made an independent revi.tsw of the record in that case

18

and hold that the Regional Directors findings and conclusions

19

are correct."

on a motion for summary

There’s a footnote and they point to some findings

20
21

that they disagree with, that do not affect the correctness of

22

his ultimate conclusion that there is an appropriate unit and

23

said accordingly, as now all issues have been fully litigated

24

and no newly discovered or previously unavailable evidence is

25

offered, no further hearing is required. We shall, therefore,
24
7

I

grant the general counsels motion for summary judgement.

2

The Board thus acknowkedges that while review of a

3

Regional Directors decision in a representation case may be

4

discretionary, independent Board review is required should the

B

representation case ripen into an unfair labor practice case.

0

And the Petitioner here is entitled to no less, if

7

the lav/ is to be administered fairly and without discrimination.

Q

And Petitioner respectfully urges that the enforcement decree

9

be vacated.

10

Thank you very much.

12

Thank you, Mr. Chandler, Mr. Come, you may

proceed.

ARGUMENT OF NORTON J. COME, ESQ.

14

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT.
MR. NORTON J9 COME: May it please the Court, and

15

16

Mr. Chief Justice.
As this Court is aware, an employer who contests the

17
18

validity of a representation election conducted under Section

19

9 of the Act, including the unit determination can obtain Court

20

review of that determination only through an unfair labor pra~

21

ctice proceding under Section ID.
That is, he can fefuse to bargain on the grounds that

22
23

the certificaiton is invalid, thereby triggering off an unfair

24

labor practice complaint, and if the Board ultimately finds a

25

violation of Section

8

8 A 5 , and issues a bargaining order,
25

i

he gets review of the bargaining order and of the underlying

2

certifications, the record of which is before theCeurt of Appeal

3

by virtue of Section 9 D, under Section 10, E and F.

4

Now since early Wagner Act days, it has been es­

5

tablished that absent newly discovered evidence or other

6

circumstances, the employer is not fentitiled to re-litigate in

7

this Seciton 10 unfair labor practice prodedings, any issues

8

which were or could have been litigated or determined in th©

9

prior related representation procedings.

m

And as this Court explained in the Pittsburgh Plate

II

Glass ca'se, in 1941, this is because the unit preceding and the

12

complaint of unfair labor practice is now really one preceding*

13
14

And thus a single trial of the representation, issue
was enough*

15

Now mntil 1959, the issues in a Seciton 9 represen­

16

tation preceding as weHaas those in a Section 9 unfair labor

17

practice preceding were determined by the Board itself*

18

Now in that year, Congress amended Section 3 B to

19

permit the Board to delegate to its Regional Directors its

20

powers, namely the-'Boards powers, under Section 9, including the'

21

power to determine the unit appropriate for the purposes of

22

collective bargaining, provided, however, that upon the request

23

of an interested person, the Board, and this is Congress0 wosds,

24

may review any action of a Regional Director delegated to him*
Now pursuant to this authorisation, the Board has

25

26
S

1

2

delegated its powers to determine Representation issues to
its Regional Directors»

3

The procedures^ in brief, are as follows* and they

4

are set forth in raare detail in our brief. When a petition is

5

filed withthe Regional Director, and an investigation shows that

6

it appears

1

for hearing before a Hearing Officer.

to have merit, the Regional Director sets that down

8

On the basis of the record developed at the hearing,

9

and I might say that an examination of the Appendix here shows

10

that there was a very full hearing before the Hearing Officer

it

with plenty of opportunity

12

cross examine the witnesses including Scott on his duties.

13

on the part of the employer to

And after this record is completed, it goes to the

14

Regional director-who determines on the basis of the record, the

15

unit appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining and

«6

directs an election or makes other disposition in the matter,
The Boards rules further provide the Rggional Director

17
18

shall set forth hS*s findings conclusions and order or direction

19

which he has done in this case, indeed, the Court of Appeals

20

found that the Regional Directors decision was as full and com­

21

plete as any he had reviewed, where the Board itself had written

22

the opinion. It wasavery complete

23

Director.
The Boards rules provide that the decision of the Re­

24
25

decision by the Regional

gional Director shall be final unless a request for review is
10

27

!

filed with the Board» Then the rules regarding review set forth

Z

a number of grounds upon which review may be granted by the

3

Board or the Regional Oirector if he thinks that the issue is

4

an important one that should be decided by the Board* he has.

5

authority to transfer it forthwith to the Board»

6

Now where he has not done that* and he did not do

7

that here, a party after fche director has decided the case can

8

obtain review if he persuades the Board that his case falls

0

within one of the four categories that are set forth in the

10

Boards rules»
That there was a substantial question of law pre­

11
12

sented, that procedural error was committed, that there was a

13

departure from Board policy, or, and that's what's involved in

14

this case, that the Regional Directors decision on a factual

IS

issue is clearly erroneous on the record and such error pre-

18

judicially affects the rights of a party»

*

The Boards rules further provide that any request for

17

18

a reviet*? must be a self-contained document enabling the Board

19

to review on: the basis of its contents and that with respect to

20

ground two, which is the factual error ground or any other ground

21

where appropriate, said request must contain a summary of all

22

evidence or all rulings bearing on the issues together with

23

page citationssfrom the transcript and a summary of argument»
And Petitioner fully availed itself of its right

24
2S

under this rule to file with the Board a very detailed request

II

28

i

1

for review which starts at page 117 of the record and goes to

2

page 127 of the. record, setting forth in very specific detail

3

the respects in which the Regional Director erred, with re­

4

cord references as to evidence that he aXiedgedly overlooked

5

to the duties of Scott as well as the other two individuals

C>

whose status whas in question, and also a very detailed legal

7

argument as to the applicable legal principles and controlling

8

Board decisions thattthe Regional Director allegedly over­

9

ruled .

10

Overlooked„
The Boards rules further provide that the, that an

11

opposition may be filed to a request for review, although itss

12

not reprinted in the record, I find in examining the original

13

record that the petitioning union also filed a document with

14

the Board in opposition to the request for review which again

15

contained a very detailed recital of the record evidence, sup­

16

porting the Regional Directors ruling»
and the Board had these two documents before it, as

17
18

well as the decision of the Regional Director, and on the basis

19

of that decided that no issue warranting review was provided»

20

And that, kind of a situation @s the Court of Appeals pointed out

n

in its opinion, it cannot be said that the Board, in deciding

22

that no issue was presented, merely rubber stamped the Regional

23

Director. You had as focus a presentation of the issues as you

24

could possibly have had, had the Board reviewed the record de

25

novo.
29

12

1

Q

Mr» Come, would your case be different if you

2

had been just a rubber stamp? Are you suggesting that itBs es­

3

sential that the Board at some point review the Regional Dir­

4

ector?

5

A

No* I'm not saying that, but I'm just saying that

6

under the procedure that the Board has devised for implementing

7

the 3B delegation* there is a very real opportunity provided to

8

a party requesting review to catch the Boards eye if there is

9

any glaring error on the part of the Regional Director»

10

1!

Q

case it thinks if wrongly decided»

12

13

Well* I don't suppose the Board reviews every

A

Well* if it satisfies one o® the vriteria for

granting review--—

14

Q

Well* again I'll ask you* do you think that there

15

would be error in this case if the Board had never looked at

16

a scrap of what was before—
A

11

m

No* I do:

not* because I think 3B permits the

Board to delegate the authority to the Regional Director»

19

However* 3B says that any party* subject to the right

20

of any party to request a Board to review the case * so I think

21

that there has to be an opportunity to request the Board to—

22

Q

Well, sure* well* that's available—

23

A

Yes „

24

Q

But your case really doesn91 depend on how much

25

the Board looked at the Regional Directors determination* does
30
13

2

it?

z

A

3

Q

You might be in trouble if it did»

4

A

Well, I’m not suggesting that there was a de

No, it ddes not, but I just want to——

3

novo or plenary review» However, I wanted to point out that

6

this petition to review procedure, on the other hand, is a

?

meaningful one, and it’s not a mere rubber stamping of the Re­

a

gional Director»

B

But to get back to the Boards rules» The Boards

W

rules finally provide that denial of a request for a review

It

shall constitute an affirmance of the Regional Directors action,

12

which shall also preclude re-litigating any such issues in

13

any related subsequent unfair labor practice preceding»

U

So that the issue that we really come down to, here,

15

is whether or not this procedure is valid and authorized by

18

Section 3B of this statute, or put more specifically, whether

17

the Board may properly apply the settled principle barring

m

re-litigation in a subsequent

19

preceding of Tissues determining the representation preceding

20

where it has delegated this authority to the Regional Director

21

and pursuant to the

22

his determination or whether, as Petitioners contend, and as

23

the Sesond Circuit held in Pepsi Cola, the Board is required

24

before basing an unfair labor practice finding on this

25

representation determination of the directors to make a new and

3B delegation and as declined to review

31
14

related unfair labor practice

1

de nov© full review of the record«

£

1 might say that the Second Circuit itself seems to

3

have becked down substantially from Pepsi' Cola in two decisions

4

subsequent to Pepsi Cola# which are cited in our brief# Olsen

3

Bodies# and Baliss Trucking# apparently they are now holding

6

that the Pepsi Cola requirement for de r*.ovo

7

to situations where you have# as they put it# a difficult mixed

8

question of law and fact»

9

10

review applies only

So the substantial amount of substance has been taken
out of Pepsi Cola by the Second Circuit itself»

11

Well# our position is basically that both the language

12

of Section 3B and its legislative history support the valididy

13

of the Boards delegation procedure» On its face# 3B, as I have

14

just outlined to the Court indicates a Congressional purpose

15

to endow the Regional Director with all the powers which the

10

Board previously had in the Secion 9 preceding# subject to such

17

review as the Board might provide»
Now since the Boards powers in a Section 9 preceding

18
19

previously meant that you were# the Board was not required to

20

re-examine in the unfair labor practice preceding issues that

21

were determined in the our case# if you put the Regional Dir­

22

ector in the shoes of the Board# it should follow# we submit

23

that there is no fight to have a Board re-determination of the

24

issue determined by the Regional Director in the unfair labor

25

practice preceding add some ?iewly discovered evidence»

32
15

f

!

Q

Do you think in the present case, the action of

Z

the review passes muster under the Baiiss and Olsen Body cases

3

in the Second Circuit?

4

A

I don't know whether theSecond Circuit would

S

regard -the type of issue that we have here as being the diffi­

8

cult question of mixed law and facts, that would require the

7

Board to review the record de novo.

8
9

The Court of Appeals in this case had great doubt in
knowing how to apply that standard. What you had in Pepsi

m

Cola was the question as to whether or not certain employees

a

were independent contractors or not.

12

The question that you have here—

13

Q

—a question quite like—

14

A

It's a question quite like—

15

Q

—-like a supervisory question.

16

A

It is a question quite like the supervisor quest­

17

ion, and therefore I would be inclined to say that the Second

18

Circuit would regard this case as controlled by Pepsi Cola,

19

rather than by Baiiss and Olsen.

20

Q

And you would not pass muster under Pepsi Cola.

21

A

That is my opinion, that we probably would not.

0

I’ve had some difficulty trying to read these

22

However—

23
24

later cases as ammodification of the Pepsi Cola ease, rather

25

than merely a treatment of a different problem, a dfferent kimcj
16

33

1

of problem within the framework of Pepsi Cola, I notice that

z

Judges Lombard* Kaufman* and Smith* two of the three of them

were on all of the panels,

Except in Olsen, In Olsen you had a different

3

panel* Judge Smith was the only one common to the* who sat om

6

Pepsi Cola,

7

You had Judge Friendly and Judge—

8

Q

Judge Smith and Judge Fienberg,

9

A

Oh yes* Judge Smith and Judge Fienberg who were

10

not on Pepsi Cola* and judge Friendly in his opinion in Olsen

11

speaking for himself and Judge Fienberg* because Judge Smith

12

specially concurred on that point indicated that he had grave

13

misgivings as to the validity of Pepsi Cola* but then he went

14

on to find Pepsi Cola distinguishable on the ground that the
V

15

issue ther e was not as important, or as difficult as the one

16

in Pepsi Cola,
But in any event* our position is that neither the

17
18

language of the statute* nor the legislative history permits*

19

or warrants the kind of distinction that the Second Circuit

20

is now drawing. We think that the* it was Congress' intention

21

to permit the Board to delegate final authority subject to this

22

limited right of review by the Board* of all representation is­

23

sues* particularly* including those involving a determination o

24

of an appropriate unit* whether it be a supervisory question or

25

an independent contractor question or plant clerical question*

34
17

1

as you had in Olsen Body,

a

For the simple reason that the basic Congressional

3

objective, as is in enacting 3B delegation as is succinctly

4

pointed out by Senator Goldwater, in a quotation that we have

0

on Page 18 of our brief, who was ,on the House-Senate Conference

6

Committee, was to expedite final disposition of cases by the

7

Board, by turning over part of its case load to its Regional

8

Directors for final determination„

9

And then he goes on tb say, that they've empowered

10

the Regional Director to act in all respects as the Board

n

itself would act.

12

Now you don't—-

13

Q

14

What—how does the Board speak?—in an unfair

labor practice?

15

A

In an unfair labor practice case, if there are

‘16

exceptions, to the trial examiners findings, the Board will

17

take the case up and review the record itself with respect to

IS

those matters that are aecepfcibie to them*

19

Q

What's the standard that the Board applies to

A

It would apply the predominance of the evidence

23

Q

Preponderance?

24

A

Preponderance»

25

Q

Now I gather in this case the trial examiners'

20

that?

21

22

standard,,

18

35

I

findings included the Regional Directors findings,» did it not,

2

on the representation issue?

3

A

Yes, sir»

4

Q

And what is the difference? I suppose an ex-

5

ception was taken to those findings» In the trial examiners

3

findings in the unfair labor practice

7

standard that the Board applies to that exception?

8
9

A

case. Now what9s the

Well, the Board did not regard---the trial

examiner made no findings here, he—

10

Q

Well doesn't he incorporate—

n

A

He granted a motion for summary judgement and

12

since the—

13

Q

.Yes , but when ha files his findings in these

14

cases do they not include the findings in the representation

15

cases?

16

A

17

Q

18

A

Review the——

19

Q

So that even

Yes,,but the Board does not te-review the—
That * s what I wanted to get»

though they're in the trial ex­

20

aminers findings, to this extent at least, what you've told

21

us, the applieaiton of preponderance of the evidence rules

22

does not apply»

23

A

That is correct, but it would not have applied—

24

Q

Before 3B?

25

A

It would not have applied—

36
19

1
2

Q

Welly before 3B, of course, it was the Board

that made it* wasn't it?

3

A

That is correct.

4

Q

And in that circumstance, of Course, you wouldn’t

5

expect the Board to go back over it again.

6

A

That is—

7

Q

But I just wanted to be clear, now. They apply

8

the same rule to -5die Regional Directors findings that they used

9

to apply to their own which they don’t review them at all.

10

A

That is correct. That is correct.

n

Q

Just from curiosity, did you say the Board, in

12

reviewing 'the trial examiner© findings really makes it a pre-

13

ponderance of the evidence

determination—

14

A

Well, they—

15

Q

Themselves, or is isn't merely an erroneous

16

standard or a substantial evidence test?
A

17

Well, it’s more than substantial evidence, Now

10

as to the difference between clearly erroneous and pre-

19

ponderance of the evidence I think we could get into a nice

20

philosophical-Q

21

22

They actually say to themselves, would we have

made the same findings the trial examiner made—
A

23

Except with regard to credibility. They usually

24

will not disturb a trial examiners credibility determination,

25

I might say that in this case there were no credibility issues

37
20

1

because the only important issue on which there was a conflict

z

in the evidence as to whether or not Scott had followed the

3

discipline of an employee , the Regional Director assumed the

4

validity, accepted as true the companies version that he did,

S

on one occasion, threaten to fire this man, but found that that,

0

but even assuming that that were true, that one incident was

7

sporadic and not—so that it did not overcome the other evi­

8

dence showing a non-supervisory authority.

9
10

Now I just want to, in closing, say one word about
this motion to —newly discovered evidence.

11

Now the Respondent could have gotten a hearing in

12

the unfair labor practice case if in response to the order to

13

show cause it was able to come forward with evidence that was

14

in fact newly discovered.

IS

Now obviously in view of the—-

16

Q

Will you stop right there, Mr. Come, please?

17

A

Xes.

18

Q

If they had come forward with this, then there

19

would have been a redetermination in the first instance by

20

the trial examiner of the representation case?
A

2!

Had they come forward with newly discovered

22

evidence, the trial examiner would have held a hearing with

23

respect to the issue that was newly discovered, and in the

24

light of that evidence he would have reconsidered the Regional

25

Directors determination and then it would have gone up to the
21

38

1

Board»

2

Q

To the Board,

3

A

However, what happened here was that Petitioners

4

claim of newly discovered evidence was a bare naked allegation

5

that Scott had allegedly withheld information as to his full

S

supervisory duties with no indication whatsoever as to what it

7

was that he withheld, and then as the trial examiner found, and

8

as - Petitioners offer of proof shows, which is in the record,

9

Petitioner, when it listed what it was going to show at this

10

hearing, ticked off factors as to Scotts power to discipline,

11

his power to recommend raised, and so on, a list of 10 items

12

all of which had been gone into very thoroughly in the re­

13

presentation case and which was subject to cross examination

14

by Petitioner»

15

So that the Trial examiner found that in those cir­

m

cumstances , the claim that there was newly discovered evidence

17

here was merely a sham in an effort to attempt -.to re-litigate

18

the very same issues that had been gone into extensively in

19

the representation case, and the Court of Appeals sustained

20

that, finding»

21

So we submit that in those circumstances there cer­

22

tainly was no substantial issue that merits attention by this

23

Court on the question of whether there was newly discovered

24

evidence that would have warranted a hearing in this case»

25

Q
22

Are you suggesting that this case, then, does.
39

t

not present the issue of the conflict between and among the

2

circuits * Pepsi Cola vis a vis the other cases?
A

3

No, 1 am not* Your Honor* I am merely suggesting

4

that the conflict has been muted somewhat by the Second Circuit

5

subsequent decisions in—-subsequent to Papsi Cola* but I

6

think on the type of issue that we haw here* we still have

7

that conflict
Jind I submit that the view of the First Circuit which

8
9

has been adopted by the Tbnth Circuit* is the correct one* and

10

the one that is thfe most consonant with Congress9 objective in

fl

enacting the amendment 3B* because the practical point of the

12

matter is I think* as Mr» Justice White pointed out yesterday*

13 I if you are going to require the Board* when a representation
14

determination ends up in an unfair labor practice preceding *

15

and potentially any certification case can do that because

15

that9 s the only way the employer can get review * to review the

fj

record fully at that stage * you are not making the Regional

18

Directore defcerminaiton final as Congress intended to do* sub-

19 P ject to merely discretionary review by the Board* and you are
20

robbing the Arpege delegation of the timesaving that Congress

21

intended to get from permitting the board to do that* becuase

22

whatever time is saved at the .Arpege stage is going to be dis-

23 I sapated at the

— stage* and we have statistics in eaur brief

24

which show that it9s rather dramatic* that under the Arpege

25

delegation* and when the Regional Director is permitted to decide;

23

40

1

these thmngs himself, the time from filing of a petition to

2

direction of election is in the neighborhood of 48 days*

3

Whereas, if it goes to the Board , it is about 245

4

days, and you would just be substantiallysappii# the Arease

5

delegation of the value that Congress has sought to achieve

6

and it is not necessary, we submit, to protect the fundamental

7

rights of respondents the Board procedings as is amply shown

a

by the record in this case.
Thank you. Your Honor,
