MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER5

Case Wo. 14, North Caro­

lina, appellant, versus Henry C. Alford, appellee.

Mr. Safrcn, you may begin, if you are ready.

ARGUMENT OF JACOB L. SAFRON, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. SAFRON;

7

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

8

Court:

This matter is before this Court upon direct appeal in

9

the United States Court of Appeals of the Fourth Circuit.

10

Oral argument was originally heard in this case on

11

November 17, 1969, immediately prior to oral arguments being

12

held in Parker vs. North Carolina and Brady vs. United States.

13

On May 4, 1970, this Court handed down the trilogy

14

of guilty-plea cases, Parker vs. North Carolina, Brady vs. Uni­

15

ted States, and McMann vs. Richardson.

16

to handing down these three cases, this Court set the Alford

17

case back on the docket for reargument.

However, the week prior

!8

Whan Alford, Parker and Brady were originally argued,

19

the issue before this Court was the impact in United States vs.

20

Jackson upon statutory schemes authorizing the death penalty

21

only upon a jury trial, and permitting a defendant who pled

22

guilty to receive a mandatory life sentence.

23

Inasmuch as Parker and Brady now speak directly to

24

this issue and hold that it is not involuntary, that these

25

guilty pleas were not involuntary because induced by the
2

t

defendant's desire to limit the possible maximum penalty to

2

less than that authorised when there is a jury trial, I will

4«#

O

direct my arguments upon this reargument to the applicability

4

of Parker, Brady and McMana to the facts of this case.

5

On the evening of November 22, 1963, Nathaniel Young,

6

a Negro, operated an establishment in the city of Winston-Salem,

7

Forsyth County, North Carolina, which can best be described as

3

a "party house."

9

There was a knock at the door and Nathaniel Young

10

partially opened that door and he was cut down by* a shotgun

11

blast.
©

Earlier that evening, Henry C. Alford had come to

12

13

that house.

Henry Alford also is Negro.

Alford had been ac­

14

companied to that house by a young white lady.

13

chased several drinks of liquor by the drink, sold in that

16

house, which is illegal under the North Carolina Prohibition

17

lav/, and then Henry Alford gave Nathaniel Young, the proprietor,

IS

his last dollar in order to rent a room for several hours that

19

evening in the house.

They had pur­

Alford was accompanied into that room by his girl­

20
21

friend.

22

Alford no longer had any money.

23

But several minutes later they left, because Henry

He wanted this young lady to leave this house with

24

him.

25

advised Alford that she can stay here.

She didn’t want to go.

3

Nathaniel Young, the proprietor,

An argument followed.

1

Henry Alford grabbed the young

2

lady's coat and, while being chased by Nathaniel Young and

3

someone else,- he took her coat, ran out the door, and these two

4

followed him.

5

Q

Where do all these facts come from?

6

A

These facts, your honor, are represented to the

7

Superior Court of Forsyth County upon the tender of Henry C.

8

Alford®s plea- prior to the acceptance of the plea by the

9

Court.

20

lady who saw Henry Alford walk down the street with his weapon,

6

State's evidence.

I wouldn't use the word full case? your honor?
In each and every instance? upon the

7

Q

Is this only in capital cases?

8

A

No, your honor? this is in all cases.

9

Q

All felony cases?

10

A

Yes, your honor.

The Court wants to be assured

It

that the State does have a case against the defendant and? of

12

course, at the same time, the Court wants to hear evidence, so

13

that the Court would be in a better position to determine the

14

sentence to impose upon the conviction.

15

This is a general operating procedure,

16

Q

And is there in addition to this a pre-sentence

17

investigation, a pre-sentence report, or does this perform

18

that function that is performed in other jurisdictions?
A

19

Our statutes do provide for pre-sentence reports.

20

Unfortunately? we have a problem in North Carolina.

Judges ro­

21

tate from District to District.

ZZ

District to which they are elected. They move from term to

23

term.

24

in that District and they don't have immediate friends among

25

the bar in that district.

They do not sit in the same

The idea is so that they are not bound to the electorate

1

It is a commendable idea,

but unfortunately, because

2

of this operation of rotation, it is very difficult to use pre-

3

sentence reports because, if you are going to put off sentenc­

4

ing in order to obtain the pre-sentence report, in most instance s

5

the judge will no longer be sitting.

6

And so this serves part of that function, your honor.

7

When Henry Alford was indicted by the grand jury,

8

counsel was immediately appointed, counsel thoroughly investi­

9

gated the case against Henry Alford, counsel spoke to every

10

witness named to him by Henry C. Alford, except for one who

If

could not be found.

2

4
In -each instance, the testimony of the purported wit­

3

ness was contrary to Alford's allegations as to what their tes­

4

timony would be.
When the case was called for trial, Henry Alford,

IS
6

through counsel, entered a plea of guilty fcojsecond-degree

7

murder, which carries a maximum sentence of thirty years in

IS
9

prison.
He did not tender a plea to first-degree murder, whic*

20

would have carried a mandatory life sentence.

21

second-degree murder, carrying a maximum of thirty years.

His plea was to

2Z

And, as I said, after the tender of the plea, this

23

presentation was made by the solicitor, showing the evidence

24

available to the State.

2B

Prior to the tender of this plea, counsel had obtainet
6

1

an affidavit from Henry Alford.

2

ginally filed in the records of the case,, but was introduced

3

into evidence at the subsequent post-conviction hearing.

4

This affidavit was not ori­

Now, this affidavit, which was obtained by counsel

5

prior to tendering the plea, reads:

6

Alford, after first being duly sworn, deposes and says:

8

represent the defendant, has conferred with the defendant on

It is my opinion that the attorney is able,, experi­

6

Q

What was the occasion for getting that affidavit?

7

A

The occasion, your honor, was, number one, coun­

8

sel wanted something in record to show that he was authorized

3

to tender the plea of guilty to second-degree murder.

It was

10

a worthwhile protection for counsel, because, unfortunately,

1!

in most post-conviction proceedings, the question arises of the

12

authority of counsel to tender the plea.
And that is the very reason that this Court, in

13

14

Halliday vs. United States, imposed upon the Federal judiciary

15

and, in Boykin vs. Alabama, the requirements of Federal Rule

18

11.
This case arose prior to the time, well before the

17
18

time of Boykin, before the time of Halliday, yet counsel wished

19

to prove his authorization.
Q

20

This procedure is one rather commonly recommended

21

in published manuals on functions of defense lawyers these days,

22

is it not?

23

A

It

a common function.

And I know, when I was

24

in private practice, I always obtained a written authorization

25

so as to have hard evidence in the future,
8

if the defendant

1

ever stated that I wasn't authorised to tender a plea, of guilty

2

on his behalfo

3

Of course? this all goes back to the pre-Boykin days?

4

the pre-IIalliday days.

5

the defendant really is interrogated fully as to the voluntari­

Q

ness of his plea.

7

Q

Now

it doesn't really matter? because

Well? Mr. Safron? 1 am sure that you didn’t put

8

into those affidavits that yon were very capable, etc., did

9

you?

I mean that last little sentence.

10

A

Well? that, perhaps? would have been egotism?

11

your honor.

But the presentation of the State's case on the

12

tender of the plea, I submit revealed a classic case of circum­

13

stantial evidence? which could have been handed to the least-

14

experienced member of the solicitor's staff and still unques­

15

tionably resulted in Henry C. Alford's conviction of first-

16

degree murder.

Approximately three months later he filed a petition

for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of North Carolina»

the Forsyth County Superior Court for a plenary hearing, an

evidentiary hearing, under the North Carolina Post-Conviction

Hearing Act.

upon the evidence presented at that hearing, the judge presiding

Q -- on that petition for certiorari to the State

12

Court and in the State collateral proceeding, was the primary

13

claim the one that we dealt with last term?

14

A

Yes, your honor. He claimed that he was coerced

IS

into pleading guilty to second-degree murder, because of the

16

coercive threat of the death penalty.

17

It was the Jackson-type argument.

18

That was his basic claim —-

Yes, it was.

FURTHER ARGUMENT OF JACOB L. SAFRON, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

6

—— It was not within the territorial jurisdiction of

7

the Court.

8

prison unit within the Court’s jurisdiction and that applica­

9

tion was reinstated.

However * a week or two later, he was moved to a

10

Honorable Eugene Gordon, Judge of the Middle District

1?

of North Carolina, subsequently entered an order denying Alford

12

Haheus Corpus release.

13

Forty-eight days after entry of the order, Alford

14

filed a notice of appeal in the Fourth Circuit Court of Ap­

15

peals,

16

the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals,

17

He also filed an original writ

of Habeus Corpus in

A panel of the Fourth Circuit determined that the

!8

Court had no jurisdiction to note his late notice of appeal.

1©

But Chief Judge Haynsworth considered the application for writ

20

of Kabeus Corpus filed originally in that Court, and entered

21

an order, a copy of which is in the appendix, concluding that

22

the plea of guilty was freely and voluntarily entered upon the

23

advice of competent counsel.

24

2S

Chief Judge Haynsworth3s order is to be found on
pages 19 and 20 of the appendix.
13

1

Alford subsequently filed yet another application for

2

writ of Habeus Corpus in the United States District Court for

3

the Middle District of North Carolina.

4

reviewed his contentions and once again denied release.

5

Judge Cordon once again

From that denial, Alford appealed to the Fourth Cir­

8

cuit Court, of Appeals.

In the interim between the noting of

7

that appeal and the argument, this Court decided, in United

8

States vs. Jackson, and upon that appeal, the Fourth Circuit

9

Court of Appeals decided based upon what now appears to be an

10

erroneous reading of United States vs. Jackson, held that the

II

statutory scheme in North Carolina for the imposition of capi­

12

tal punishment was unconstitutional.

13

supplied by that scheme to offer to plead guilty was the

14

primary motivating force, to effect his tender of that plea.

And that the incentives

15

From that opinion Chief Judge Haynsworth dissented.

16

Now, both the Brady and Parker cases cited by this

17

Court this last spring, involved the question of the validity

18

of pleas of guilty entered to capital offenses under which cir-

19

cumstances the plea guaranteed that the accused would escape

20

the possible imposition of the sentence of death.

21

*

The issue presented, as stated by this Court in Brady,

22

was whether it violates the Fifth Amendment to influence or

23

encourage a guilty plea by the opportunity or promise of lenien­

24

cy, and whether a guilty plea is coerced and invalid if influ­

25

enced by fear of a possibly higher penalty to the crime charged.
14

1

if a conviction is obtained after the State has been put to its

z

proof.

3

In both Brady and Parker, this Court denied relief,

4

holding that an otherwise valid plea is not involuntary because

5

induced by defendant's desire to limit the possible maximum

6

penalty to less than that authorised if there is a jury trial.

7

In so holding, this Court rejected the contention

8

that United States vs. Jackson, which had previously held in­

9

valid a provision in the Federal Kidnapping Act, holding the

10

death penalty to be invalid under the statutory Scheme under

ii

the Federal Kidnapping Act, that under that, under United

12

States vs. Jackson, that the guilty plea would be rendered in­

13

operative, that the death penalty which only could be imposed

14

upon a jury trial, rendered invalid the defendant's tender of

15

a plea of guilty to the offense.

16

As this Court stated in Brady, a plea of guilty en­

17

tered by the expectations of a completely counseled defendant

18

that the State will have a strong case against him, is not sub­

19

ject to later attack because the defendant's lawyer correctly

20

advised him with respect to then existing law as to possible

21

penalties.

22

Based upon the Parker and Brady cases, the United

23

States Court of Appeals of the Fourth Circuit on July 15, 1970,

24

decided en banc the case of Kincaid

25

excuse me, Kincaid Wilson vs. North Carolina--rejecting in
15

Wilson vs. United States—

1

Wilson its former holding in Alford, except for the caveat con­

2

tained in a footnote to be found on page 6 of that opinion—

3

excuse rae, it is page 7, footnote 6.

4

For our purposes here, the discussion is limited to

5

the case of defendant against whom a legitimate prosecution is

©

brought in good faith and who has admitted his guilt to the

7

offense charged„

8

The propriety of accepting a plea of guilty from a

9

defendant who contemporaneously asserts his innocence may be

10
11

subject to additional considerations.
In -the Wilson case, the Fourth Circuit rejected the

12

former holding in the Alford case that is now before this Court

13

as to the application of United States vs. Jackson, except for

14

this caveat in this particular situation.

15

From a reading of Parker, Erady and Wilson, it foe-

16

comes clear that the basis for the original holding of Fourth

17

Circuit in Alford is no longer viable.

18

In Parker this Court rejected the contention that a

19

guilty plea to the capital charge carrying a sentence of life

20

imprisonment was involuntary because it was induced by a sta­

21

tute governing, that is, by a statute providing a maximum pen­

22

alty in the event of a plea of guilty lower than the penalty

as

authorised after a verdict of guilty by a jury.

24
as

In Brady this Court held that an otherwise valid plea
is not involuntary because induced by defendant's desire to
16

?

limit the possible maximum penalty to less than that authorized

2

if there is a jury trial.

3

As Justice White stated in McMann vs. Richardson,

4

the third case of the guilty-plea trilogy, the decision to

5

plead guilty before the evidence is in frequently involves the

6

making of difficult judgments.

7

mally cannot be known unless witnesses are examined and cross-

8

examined in court.

9

pute.

10

All the pertinent facts nor­

Even then, the truth will often be in dis­

In the face of unavoidable uncertainty, defendant and

11

his counsel must make their best judgments as to the weight of

12

the .State's case»

13

Counsel must predict how the facts, as he understands

14

them, will be viewed by a court, if proved, those facts con­

15

vince a judge or jury of defendant’s guilt.

16

In McMann Justice White concluded, in our view a

17

defendant’s plea of guilty based upon reasonably competent ad­

18

vice is an intelligent plea, not open to attack on the grounds

19

that counsel may have misjudged the admissibility of the defen­

20

dant’s confession.

21

Justice White goes on to say -—

Mrs.

Bray?
ARGUMENT OF BORIS R. BRAY, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE

24

25

Thank you, Mr, Saffron,

MRS. BRAY:

If it please the Court:
18

I would first

1

like to point out that what the Fourth Circuit decided in this

z

case was that the record showed that, as a matter of fact, this

3

guilty plea was involuntary»

4
5

In this case we have all of the facts in the record
and the Fourth Circuit

6

Q

Do you suggest that a finding of fact by a

7

court of appeal should override a finding of fact by an origi­

8

nal trier?

9

A

Well, where it is clearly erroneous, yes, sir»

10

Q

I am speaking of this kind of a record, where

11
12

all the facts are reviewed.
A

Go ahead.

I might point out that that question was dis­

13

cussed in my brief in the Fourth Circuit and was decided by the

14

Fourtli Circuit, but has never been discussed or briefed by the

15

State, the question whether the court ought to review and make

16

an independent determination of the facts.

17

Q

Do you read that holding of the Court of Appeals

18

as proceeding on the basis of the findings of fact in the trial

19

court were erroneous or that the opposite result was required

20

by Jackson against the United States?

21

A

I think that what the Court of Appeals said was

22

that Jackson does not dictate a reversal of every guilty plea

23

decided undex~ the unconstitutional statutory scheme for imposing

24

the death penalty in North Carolina.

ZS

However, they said that their own independent view
19

1

or, rather, review of the facts indicated that this plea was in

2

fact involuntary, considering Jackson as a factor.

3
4

And this Court, in Brav, recognized that the statu­
tory scheme is in fact a legitimate factor to be considered.

5
6

Q

So you think they did reverse the trial court

on its findings?

7

A

Yes, sir, I think they did.

The District Court

8

simply reviewed the findings of the State Court and made no

9

independent findings itself.

10

The critical facts in making these determinations are

11

these.

12

attorney advised him to plead guilty and advised him that the

13

circumstances were aggravated, that the jury would not look

14

favorably upon the facts of the case.

15

that he would get the death penalty.

16

clear that Alford never thought anything else, but that he

17

would surely get the death penalty if he did not plead guiltv.

IS

Alford is a Negro, he has very little education.

Q

His

And he denied saying
However, the record is

Well, do you suppose that the orima facie case

19

demonstrated by the State in the manner that was outlined by

20

your friend this morning had some influence on his decision,

21

too, as to what the State was going to show on the trial?

22

A

Well, I think the prima facie case could have

23

some influence on it.

24

in this case, however, that that didn*t influence him, that

2.5

the only thing he recognized was that he was going to get the

I think that the record clearly shows

20

I
2

3
4

8
9

death penalty if he didn8t plead guilty.
Q

Would you think that that was not a strong case

the State was going to make against him on the facts?
A

Well, surely, if the State had no strong case,

there would have been no problem.
Q

Those recitals add up to an overwhelming case

against the defendant, do they not?
A

The evidence as related by the investigating of­

ficer, yes, sir.

But the fact is that the unconstitutional

10

statutory scheme for imposing the death penalty is what Alford

11

had in mind, and I think that it is a mistake for anvone else

12

to impose his own judgement into the case, as

13

seemed to do in his dissent.

14

Judge Haynsworth

Judge Haynsworth read the record and concluded that

15

this man was guilty, that he was well-advised to plead guilty,

16

and that he ought to plead guilty next time he got any trial.

1?

Well, that is imposing the judgement of an indepen­

18

dent observer over the judgement of the defendant, and what

19

is important in determining whether or not a guilty plea is

20

voluntary is not what we think he should have done and whether

21

we think he made the privy decision, but what was his state of

22

mind at the time he entered that plea.

23

Q

Mrs. Bray, you want us to set up the rule that

24

in a case where the plea is made of this type and the petitioner

25

in Habeus Corpus says that I did this because of the fear of
21

1

capital punishment, that that has to be upset without more.

2

What do you have more than his word?

3

A

Well, we have more than that in this case.

4

Q

What?

S

A

What we have is the man!s continuing pronounce­

6

ments of his innocence at the very trial at which he pleaded

7

guilty, and his continuing compulsion never to let that guilty

8

plea enter unqualified.

9

Q

But what do we have other than his word that the

10

only reason for his pleading guilty to second-degree was threat

11

of the death penalty?

12

A

13

You have nothing other than his word.

Perhaps not.

But we have nothing to indicate

that there was any other reason.

14

Q

What about the affidavit of

15

A

Sir?

16

Q

What about the affidavit of his lawyer?

17

A

His lawyer testified at the post-conviction

thelawyer?

18

hearing that he was not certain of what the, well, you know

19

the affidavit that he signed?

20

Q

Yes, ma'am.

25

him of the

That seems to be well-established

However, just the advice of the lawyer, it seems to
me, doesn't insulate the coercive effect of this statutory
22

1

scheme on this defendant»

2

All the advice in the world is no good if the defen­

3

dant is incapable, because of the overwhelming fear of the death

4

penalty, of making any sort of a rational evaluation of advice

S

he has received»

6

o

You keep saying the overwhelming fear of the

7

death penalty.

8

evidence against him, wasn't that present, too?

9

A

There was also an overwhelming fear of this

Well, I suppose that is necessarily present,

10

because there could be no fear of the death penalty without

11

the State having substantial evidence, which would substantiate

32

a conviction.

13

Q

That is my problem.

1 don’t see how he can

14

separate in his own mind which was the overwhelming influence,

15

as between the threat of the death penalty and the amount of

16

evidence against him, and the fact that he didn't have anything

1?

to defend himself with.
A

13

Well, I doubt if he did separate it in his own

19

mind.

20

can separate them either.

21

But they are so intertwined that I don’t think the Court

If those two elements are separated, then I can't see

22

how Jackson or the statutory scheme could ever have a coercive

23

effect, as Jackson stated it did, because there would never be

24

a real fear of the death penalty if the State did not have a

25

substantial case against the defendant.
23

If there was no substantial case, then the chances

1

2

are there would have been no indictment for first-degree murder.

.3

So it seems to me that it is impossible to separate the two and

4

that the overwhelming evidence doesn't in any way dissipate the

5

coercive effect of the fear of the death penalty.
Q

6

Suppose he had been sentenced to life imprison­

7

ment and that he had been afraid of life imprisonment.

8

that be enough to set aside the judgement?

St is death, of course, but a life sentence to

some people is more threatening than the death sentence.

Are

ws to draw a distinction between the fear that is generated in
the human mind, the fear of being executed, and of the life
term?

That is what we have to do, isn't it?
A

Yes, sir, I think that is what you have to do.

Even at the trial, Alford could never allow this guilty plea to
go in uncontested.

After he took the stand, at his own requests

and related his own view of the facts, he stated "I pleaded
guilty on second-degree murder because they said there is too
much evidence, but I ain't shot no man, but I take the fault
for the other man.

We never had an argument in our life and

I just pleaded guilty because they said if I didn“f they would
gas me, and that is all."
His attorney was understandably upset by this, and
24

1

asked him if. he had not given him advice as to the possible

2

verdicts, etc., which he acknowledged he had.

3

He said do you reaffirm your intent to plead guilty?

4

He responded "Well, I*m still pleading that you all got me to

5

plead guilty.

that the jury will prosecute me on—on the second.

In the first instance, if

you have enough to indict, a man for first-degree murder and

the State chooses to indict for second-degree murder, the State

A

Well, a guilty plea was entered and a judgement

8

was entered, so in effect he has been tried.

S

for second-degree murder.

10

He

Q

He has been tried

We conceivably might adopt that doctrine some

11

day, no one can predict.

12

That a guilty plea and a judgement pursuant to it is equivalent

13

to jeopardy on a full-scale trial?

U

A

Can you cite us a case on that?

I think there is one case that I have seen in

15

California, which was decided by Mr. Justice ——, although it

16

was based on the California Constitution, not the United States

17

Constitution.

18

Q

Mrs. Bray, following up my question, that there

10

is no trial of this case after he said I didn't do it, and I’m

20

not guilty of it, etc., etc., suppose the judge had said all

21

right, X will not accept your plea of second-degree murder

.22

and we will go to trial on second-degree murder, X would assume

23

the same judge would give him the same thirty years?

24

A

Well, he never, however, had that choice.

25

Q

He never had the chance to go to the jury, is

27

1

that your point?
4

2
3

4
5
6

A

Yes, sir.

He never had a chance to have a trial

Q

For second-degree murder.

at all.
He has had an oppor­

tunity to have a trial for first-degree murder.
A

Yes, sir* correct.

But there never was any in-

7

dication that the State would permit him to plead not guilty

8

to second-degree murder.

9

plea bargaining is a reall issue at all in this case.

10

Q

For that reason, X don’t think that

If the prosecutor was faced with a rule such as

11

you suggest* I doubt if he would ever have accepted a plea of

12

second-degree murder in this case.

13

had strong evidence.

He had a strong ease* he

14

A

Perhaps.

15

Q

And he would know that if the guilty plea were

16
17

ever set aside* he might have a problem.
A

Well, that may very well be, but I question whe­

18

ther* that has much to do with whether the plea was guilty or

19

not, X mean was voluntary or not.

20

The other essential fact is that the defendant has

21

never admitted his guilt either to the Court or to the attorney.

22

This is clear from the record,, from the post-conviction hearing.

23

He has just never admitted his guilt, to anyone.

2A

And, in fact, all the Courts that have considered the

25

question have determined--even Judge Haynsworth in the original

28

1

denial of the write of Hafasus Corpus in the Fourth Circuit.
Q

2
3

Is guilt, as you use the term, a legal or a fac­

tual conclusion?

4

A

Guilt is a factual conclusion.

5

Q

Are you sure of that?

A man traditionally may

6

be guilty in fact—this is an ancient aphorism of the law-—but

7

not guilty in law.
A

8
9

Guilt is a legal conclusion, is it not?

I suppose so,

I don't think that is what the

defendant here meant when he said I am not guilty.

I suppose

10

certainly there are some cases where the question of guilt is

11

very much a legal question, so that it is not the same question

2

in the mind of the defendant as it is in the mind of the Court.

13

For example, where somebody is an accessory before the fact in

14

a murder and doesn't actually pull the trigger, he may very well

15

tiiink he is not guilty, but in law he is guilty.
In this case, though, the defendant believed he was

16
17

not guilty because he didn't believe that he was involved in

18

the crime.
Q

19

20

The defendant said I never shot the man.

His

statement' was a factual statement, true or false.
A

21

Yes, sir.

The record is clear that all during

22

the process, prior to this trial, of determining what the plea,

23

of what to plead, the defendant continually wavered back and

U
25

forth.

He said I don't want to plead guilty, he said I am in­

nocent, and the attorney called in his sister and his cousin,
29

f1
i

the policeman, and they talked to him.

2

should plead guilty, because you won't die and I will corae to

3

see you in jail.

4

make up your mind and do something, this case is being called.

5

And finally he wound up pleading guilty, but after continually

6

wavering.

And his sister said you

Finally, the attorney said, you have got to

And -the attorney stated at the post-conviction hearing

7

8

that he had to have several conferences because he wasn't sure

9

that the defendant understood.
Then at the trial itself, when the defendant continu­

10

fl

ally protested that he was innocent, the attorney sort of washed

12

his hands of the matter and said "Your honor, I don't know what

13

to do with the man."
The Court then said he says you want to plead guilty,

I think that this plea of guilty

22

At the post-conviction hearing, the attorney was asked

”Q.

Now, at anytime did you make a statement to the

Court that you didn’t know what to do with the man?

23

"A.

I certainly did.

24

t!Q.

And in that statement, Mr. Crumpler, did you

25

mean at that time that you were not sure what plea you should
32

1

enter for the man?

2

"A.

I meant simply this;

that I had advised and

3

consulted with him as far as I thought it best to* and in my

4

opinion as much as I could* that under the circumstances I

5

wasn't sure what the proper course was and I left it up to

©

the Court to make that decision.
"Q.

7

And then* Mr. Grumpier* you were in doubt as to

8

what position you were in as to what plea you were to enter if

S

you left it up to the Court?

10

"A.

Would you repeat that?

11

”Q.

You didn’t know what position you were in as to

IE

his plea did you?
“A.

13

I had no doubt of my position as to what his

14

plea was at that time.

I was doubtful of his position and for

15

that reason I left it up to the Court to determine what his

16

plea was,"
Now, it seems to me that if there is any chance which,

17
IS

under Brady, a man cannot be insulated from the coercive effect

19

of a guilty plea, even with competent counsel this is the case.
It is clear from the record that the coercive effect

20
21

of the statutory scheme was not dissipated by the presence of

22

the counsel and that all of the advice of the counsel just

23

never got through because of this horrible effect that the

24

threat of the death penalty had on the state of the mind of the

25

defendant.
33

1
2

So it seems to me impossible to conclude from this
record that this man entered a voluntary guilty plea.

3

Q

What is the coercive effect of the statutory

4

scheme, as you call it, to a plea to the lesser offense?

5

is the coercive effect?
A

6

What

Your honor, 1 think this defendant would have

7

pleaded to first-degree murder as well as to second-degree

8

murder.

9

was permitted to plead guilty to second-degree murder as op­

I think that the record shows that the fact that he

10

posed to first-degree murder had nothing to do with his deci­

ii

sion to plead guilty.

12

The thing that determined his decision to plead guilty

13

was the existence of the death penalty in the charge of first-

14

degree murder.

15

The difference between life and thirty years is not

16

much, and criminal lawyers tell me that it very seldom makes

17

much difference to the defendant xvhether he gets life or thirty

18

years, especially when he is fifty years old and the difference,

19

I think, in probation time is two and a half years under the

20

North Carolina statute.

21

That is all the difference there is.

The Court in Brady said central to the plea and the

22

foundation for entering judgement against the defendant, is

23

the defendant's admission in open court that he committed the

24

acts charged in the indictment.

25

against himself and he is shielded by the Fifth Amendment from
34

He thus stands as a witness

1

being compelled to do so.

2

the plea be the voluntary expression of his own choice.

3

the plea is more than an admission of past conduct.

4

defendant's consent that the judgement of conviction may be

entered without trial, a waiver of his right of a trial before

a jury and a judge.

I am not sure we have a consent, because the

consent was always qualified.

So I am not sure that we have

any absolute consent in this case.
And we surely don't have any admission of guilt,
which is one of the bases of the guilty plea.
The Court has always very carefully looked at any
sort of waiver of Constitutional right, and it seems to me that
in this case the right to a trial was never completely waived.
Q

Do I understand you, though, Mrs. Bray, that in

any instance of a guilty plea, that in the absence of some ad­

duct in this instance, shooting, amounts to first-degree,
second-degree, manslaughter, whatever it may be, that in the
absence at least of an admission of the conduct, the judge
ought to refuse to accept, whatever the circumstances, a plea
of guilty to any offense?

Is that what you are telling us?

A

I don5t know whether I would go that far.

Q

Would you say where, perhaps, he denies it,

I

think --

expressly denies.it?

5

A

I would certainly go that far,

1 think that any

6

defendant who feels in Court compelled to deny it ought not to

7

be permitted to plead guilty.

Q

When he says "I ain't shot no man,” that is

denial, isn’t it?
A

I think in this case, -under these facts, there

should never have bean a guilty plea accepted.
Q

Suppose we didn’t have that in this case, in this

13

record, "1 ain't shot no man, some other fellow did," we didn't

14

have that statement at all, but we had everything else, would

IS

you be here?"

16

A

If we had this serious a crime, I think I may.

17

But I think there must be a line somewhere, I am not sure where

18

it is—for example, I think a man ought to be able to plead

19

guilty to a traffic offense, pay his money in Court even if he

20

thinks he wasn’t speeding.

Q

What if a man just pleads guilty, says I plead

guilty, and nothing more, and the record does not. show that he
expressly admitted shooting the man, just said I am guilty,
and then later seeks to upset his guilty plea on the grounds
that the record does not show an admission of the act?

A

Well, no, I don’t think that is enough to upset

it in itself.
Q

You think that* unless otherwise qualified,

saying I am guilty implicitly admits the act?
A

As long as it was otherwise voluntary, as long

as he had full knowledge of all the consequences.
Q

Well, then, you do draw the line at the point

where, in this record at least, the accuse denies the -- act?

9

A

Yes.

Q

Mr. Safron, do you have some rebuttal you are

11

going to make?

12

MR. SAFRON;

No, your honor.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mrs. Brady, on behalf of the

14

Court we thank you for your assistance to the client and your

15

assistance to the Court.
