ORAL ARGUMENT BY DONALD F» OOSTERHOUSE, ESQ»

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
7

MR» OOSTERHOUSE;

Mr» Chief Justice and may it

8
please the Court;
9

This case involves an interpretation of the Civil
10

Rights Act of 1964 as it applies to discharge of an. employee
11

because of his religion.

The case also involves the question

12

of election of remedies where an employee proceeds to arbitra­
13

tion under the labor contract and also seeks to assert his
14

rights under the Civil Rights Act, including suit in Federal
IS
Court»
16

After 15 years of employment by Reynolds Metals
17

Company, Petitioner Robert Dewey was progressively disciplined
18

and discharged for refusing to work on assigned Sundays»

There

19

were three Sundays involved in 1966s August 28, September 4,
20
and September 11»
21

Dewey8® refusal to work ©n those Sundays was based
22
on his stipulated religious beliefs which prohibited him from
23

working on Sunday»

He had communicated these beliefs to

24

Reynolds sometime prior to any of the Sundays in question»
25

3

1

Dewey6s stipulated religious beliefs also forbade

2

him from asking another person to work in his place and this

3

religious belief also had been communicated to Reynolds prior

4

to any of the Sundays in question,
Q

5

Do I correctly understand that his

S

religious beliefs, however# did not prevent the company from

7

getting somebody else in his place?

S

A

This is surely true# Your Honors,

9

Q

As long as he’s not doing it,

10

A

II

to who must ask the employee to work,

12

13

That’s correct; the question boils down

Q

Is that the line of distinction# as fco

A

It is certainly our position that with

who must ask?

14

IS

these stipulated religious beliefs the duty falls on Reynolds

16

to ask another employe© to work in Mr, Dewey’s place,
Q

17

I thought the record shows# Mr,

IS

Oosterhouse# that your client# Mr, Dewey# had# in fact# asked

19

others to work in his place,

20

A

He had prior to this time asked others to

21

work in his place.

22

apparently developed and matured later as he was in this

23

situation,

24

25

Q

The religious conviction against doing that

Suppose an employer in a particular small

enterprise has all of his employees who share this belief.

4

1

What does he do about that?

2

A

And no one will work on Sunday,

Well, that obviously presents a difficult

3

situation in terms of the Commission6s guidelines and it might

4

well be in that kind of a situation that undue hardship upon

5

the employer would exist.

6

There are many possible variations here and I

7

would think if the employer schedules Sunday work as a regular

8

full-time day this is reasonably within his discretion.

9

Q

There' are many enterprises, of course, in

10

which the employer has no choice: about its a public utility,

11

electric power company, telephone company.

12

Let8s-assume that i fc

& situation in which the employer has no choice.

He has a

13

franchise which requires him to give 24 hours service, seven

14

days a week, at all times, and then alter it a little bit.

'18

Suppose he has ten employees and five of those

16

assert this privilege as was suggested, I think, in on® of the

17

briefs and all of the Sunday work falls on the other five who

13

are not observant of the Sabbath?

19

A

Well, I think the rationale to answer this

20

has to toe in terms of the undue hardship.

21

point out that, while hypothetical© of much more difficult

22

situations can toe easily imagined, the facts are in this case

23

that on each of the three Sundays involved, substantially less

24

than all of the employees in Mr. Dewey5s classification were

25

sailed upon to work.
5

And I would Ilk© to

1

tod further* that there were two employees out of

2

the classification who were nonetheless* qualified to work.

3

On on® of the days in question Reynolds* in fact* asked one of

4

these employees to work in Dewey8s place.

5

employees outside of the classification and he didn't work.

S

And none of the horrible consequences which we read about and

7

predicted in Reynolds8 brief* actually happened* even though

8

on that Sunday Reynolds did accommodate* as we say they should.

9

However* on that day they still disciplined Mr. Dewey.

1©

That is* on® of the

Now, if Reynolds had scheduled Sunday as a whole

J1

shift day regularly vie would have a different situation.

12

would need evidence from Reynolds* which we do not have in this

13

case, as to attempts to accommodate Dewey's religious beliefs

14

in other ways.

15

Would it be possible* for example* to schedule

16

extra overtime on Saturdays and on Mondays for Dewey.

17

would be a factual question as to whether this would b-a a

18

reasonable solution to get the work dons.

19

We

This

Now* if you take an example where every single

20

person in a classification objects to working on Sunday I

21

suppose the employer would experience 'undue hardship* although

22

again* this might bear some further investigation as to

23

possible ways to get this work done within ‘the requirements of

24

the company by late Saturday overtime and early Monday over­

25

time or, any one of a number of possibilities which might be

6

1

arrived at, without undue hardship.
When Hr. Dewey was discharged fee pursued

2
3

his rights both under the Civil Rights Act of '64, starting

4

by filing a charge with the Michigan Civil Rights Commission

S

and following the timely procedures of filing with the EEOC

6

and ultimately starting action in the District Court in the

7

Western District of Michigan.
Almost simultaneously he also started the

8
8

grievance procedure under the contract.

This contract had a

10

provision for binding arbitration.

11

through arbitration prior to the time he had begin suit in the

12

Western District of Michigan and the ruling of the arbitrator

13

gave him no relief.

14

language

16
17

20
21

in the Civil Rights Act? and he found that while this language
was intended to provide for occasional circumstances, it was
not intended to exempt an employs® from ©very Sunday working.
In th© arbitration hearing Mr. Dewey was
represented by his urfioh .and not by an attorney.

24
25

Reynolds was

represented by Attorney William Coughlin, an3 while Reynolds
filed a post-hearing brief, the union did not.
The arbitration ©pinion, I think, makes clear that

22
23

Th© ruling of the arbitrator was based on

in the contract which is not similar to the language

18
19

His grievance was processed

the Civil Rights Act was not, in fact, considered by the
arbitrator.
