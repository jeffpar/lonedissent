ARGUMENT OP THOMAS BRANNIGAN, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

7

MR. BRANNIGAN: Mr. Chief Justice# and may it please the

8

court. My name is Thomas Brannigan and X5m Assistant States

9

Attorney in Cook County Illinois, and I represent the Appel­

10

n

lants in this case.
I am the third Assistant States Attorney from Cook County

12

to argue this case in Court, and I want to say that I hope that

13

I can bring new insights into this appeal, but if I can111 I

14

want to let you knov/ that we have brought new faces before

15

the court, and I am at least pleased in that,

16

Q.

Are you resting on your predecessors' briefs?

17

A

On the brief, yes. The statute that we're here con­

18

cerned about is the Illinois Intimidation Statute. And not the

19

entire statute but only a subsection of the statute which was

20

held unconstitutional by a Three Judge Court and an injunction

21

was issued enjoining the States Attorney from prosecuting

22

anybody under this statute.

23

The statute provides that "a person commits

intimidation

24

when, with intent to cause another to perform or to omit the

25

performance of any act, he communicates to another a threat
3

i

to perform without lawful authority any of the following acts."

2

Mow all the other subsections were held constitutional, but

3

this one subsection "committ any criminal offense" was held

4

unconstitutional. The reasoning of the court was that' this lan­

3

guage !!commit any criminal offense" would include misdemean­

6

ors or any substantial offenses and near violations against

7

public order statutes only, and that it was therefore over­

8

broad and unconstitutional.

9

Mow before I turn to the question of the finding of un-

10

constititionality we have, as we have in all the eases, that

11

were set down with this case, the proeeedural question, and

12

that is the problem raised by what is now generally called the

13

Dombrowski-type complaint and this is the type of complaint

14

that was filed in the District Court below.but we submit that

IS

this is not a Dombrowski-type complaint, it’s not a Zwickler,

10

because in those cases there was allegation and showing of

IT

some prior activity by the state officials under the statute

18

which the court found unconstitutional»

19

In this case, nobody, none of the plaintiffs were charged

20

with a violation of this intimidation statute. Not any sec­

21

tion of it and not any subsection. The allegation that the

22

District Court fait was sufficient to bring the merits of this

23

statute to its attention was the allegation that there was a

24

threat to enforce this statute, and that the purpose of the

25

threatened enforcement was to harrass and to intimidate the

4

1

plaintiffs who were simply exercising First Amendment rights

z

in demonstrating, advocating for racial equality in Chicago»

3

But we submit that there is a big difference in this case and

4

in Dombrowski and in Zwickler because there was this course

5

of conduct that those plaintiffs could point to and say "This

6

is how we're being harrassed. This is what the state officials

7

are doing."

8
§

Now for example, one of the subsections which was held
constititional says that one of the threats made to a person

IO

which would constitute intimidation would be to take action

n

as a public official against anyone or anything or withold

12

official action or to cause such action or witholding. And

13

yet none of the plaintiffs were public officials, none of them

14

were capable of acting as public officials against anyone or

15

anything, and yet the court felt that under Dombrowski that

16

they could reach all these subsections and decide one after

17

another whether or not they were constitutional .

IS

Now we of course realize that if this dourt were to decide

19

that the District Court should not have reached this question

20

and there would be a reversal on grounds other than the

21

constitutionality of the statute that the judgement of the

22

court below would stand in fact in Illinois as the only decision

23

interpreting this subsection of the Illinois Intimidation Stat­

24

ute and that decision would be that it was unconstitutional. So

25

we would ask the Court that in this case it is our request that
5

!

if it be possible that the Court also reach the question

2

of the constitutionality of the statute.

3

Q.

On which you call the procedural question, that is

4

the threshold question of the propriety of the District Courts

5

action as it did it would follow, 1 should think perhaps that

6

this Court would vacate the 'district Court order,That would

7

vacate the opinion, wouldn't it?

8

A.

Yes it would, and —

9

Ql

That opinion would no longer be in the books because

10

you’re not going to fear it out of the Federal Supplement

11

but anybody that Shepherdired it would see that it had been

12

vacated,

13

h.

That’s true, Your Honor,

14

£t

--your threshold point.

15

A.

That's true, Your Honor,

16
17
18

IS
20
21

22
23

but —

but nevertheless that

determination would stand, we would ---Qt

What would stand? My point1 is that it wouldn’t stand.

Would it?
A.

Well, I mean that it would be a reversal on some

other ground, Your Honor,-- Q.

The judgement would be vacated, if you’re correct

on yo.ur threshold point,
A.

That’s true. Notv, we feel so strongly about the

24

question of the constitutionality of this statute, Your Honor,

25

and we feel that the District Court was wrong in finding this
6

1

statute unconstitutional, and I would like to address myself

2

immediately to that and tell you why we feel so strongly

3

about, ito I think that the first point that must be made about

4

this statute is that it is not a public order stttute. It's

5

not designed to maintain piifalic order, it's not designed as

6

a protection of. the state, of the sovereignty , but it is

7

designed to px-otect an individual from threats and the Dist­

8

rict Court in its opinion said that the term "threat*' has a

9

sinister and well defined meaning in common parlance and in

10

the law.

11

It is the expeession of the intention to inflict evil

12

or injury on another. It is more than a mere expression of

13

such an intent? it is a menace, especially any menace of such

14

a nature and extent as to unsettle the mind of a person on

15

whom it fflperates and to take away from his acts that free and

16

voluntary action which alone constitutes consent.

17

kind of threat the District Court held is what is prohibited

18

by the statute. Now the Court said that the subsection A and

19

all the other subsections were not vague, they could be

20

understood but they were overbroad.

21

That's the

And they pointed out some examples, ^hey said that this

22

statute would in effect make illegal threats by mothers to

23

block traffic, to cause a stop sign to be placed at an inter­

24

section because it is a dangerous intersection, that it would

25

prohibit threats by persons who lived in a dangerous neighbor-

7

hood to threaten to carry arras because of the dangerous neigh­
borhood. they lived in. Now I think that what the court there
does in that language is that it turns the focus from' the
threat to the parson to just advocacy of threatening in the
abstract and this statute does not prohibit people from stand­
ing up in the Civic Center in .downtown Chicago and saying "We
are going to carry arms in our neighborhood because we live
in a bad beighborhood."
In other words, "We're going to commit a crime because
we live in a bad neighborhood." This statute has nothing to
do with that type of language, that type of advocacy» To the
same extent, the mothers who want to block traffic. They can
talk about it all they want, they can advocate it and this
statute does not prohibit that type of talking and speech.
What it doss prohibit is threats directed toward somebody to
deprive that person of his free will and it's got to be that
type of sinister threat that freezes his free will and makes
him act in a way that he doesn't want to act.
And I think that the proof that the court misapplied

the

First Amendment doctrines annunciated by this Court in strik­
ing this statute

down is the statement in the brief that a

statement in the

lower court opinion that what the public

of­

ficials, that what the State of Illinois can do, is wait until
this, threatened act, this minor little insignificant violation
of a. public order statute, is carried out and then go ahead
8

1

and prosecute people for violating that law. But the-fact of

2

the matter is fehafc if the threat to the individual is suc­

3

cessful, that is "You do something or we will carry and bear

4

arms ., then , if the threat is successful and the person making

5

the threat has got his point home and has caused that indid-

8

idual to act in the way he wants him to act, he will not car'

\

7

ry out the threat, and so the situation doesn’t arise where

8

the Violation, the threatened act is ever carried out»

9

So we think that this demonstaates clearly that the Dist-

10

tric Court misapplied the doctrines annunciated by this Court

11

in the First Amendment and incorrectly came to the conclusion

12

that this statute was unconstitutional. Now we point out in

13

our brief that there are other statutes that are wider drawn,

14

the Federal Kobbs Act, for example, prohibits one from inter­

15

fering with commerce by extortion and this Court has upheld

16

that statute where there were threats simply to violate or

17

to breach a contract or to cause a strike which certainly are

18

broader than what this statute prohibits and that is the com­

19

mission of a crime.

20

Now it -also may be argued that this subsection is really

21

surplusage because there are other acts, other types of acts,

22

that are enumerated in the other subsections and that we don’t

23

really need this subsection. We think that it was a legitimate

24

exercise of the legislatures’ judgement to include this sub­

25

section so that types of threats that the legislature could not.
9
i

!

forsee which an injunctive person may devise to use to intim­

2

idate a person are also prohibited and that is, we think, suf­

3

ficient reason to defer to the legislative judgement here and

4

to approve this statute on constitutional grounds.

5

Now getting back to the procedural question, 1 must re­

6

stress that our point there is that if this Court is presently

7

considering a restatement of the Dombrowski case, or the doc­

8

trines that have eminated from it in the course of the cases

9

that have followed the Dombrowski case, we think that this

10

case, without getting into a whole restatement of that whole

11

question can simply be distinguished from Dombrowski and Zwick-

12

ler on the grounds that no one was charged with intimidation,

13

there was just a bare allegation in the complaint, that the

14

threat was made to use this statute, and there was no course

15

of conduct to which the plaintiffs could point that was any­

16

where near like what was present in Dombrowski and Zwickler,

17

and which this Court dwelled on extensively in both of those

18

opinions. By way of reaching the conclusion that the Federal

19

District Court had an obligation to make a determination of the

20

constitutionality of the statute--

21

Q.

You don’t have any 2283 argument in your case, do

12

ARGUMENT OF ELLIS E, REID. ESQ.

2

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES

3

MSU REID: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court.

4

!£§d like to begin my answering argument by some observations

5

in light of the fact that the matter has been argued twice

6

before and in light of the fact that there are four cases here,

7

which it is apparent that we're dealing with the cases, that be­

8

gan with Dombrowski and Pfister, and the issue here is whether

9

or not in the case before Court we have standing to sue. I’d

10

like to point out that in Dombrowski,, the Court said in its

11

opinion, and I'm quoting from its language because I think it's

12

important to the background of ray argument, the assumption that

13

"The defense of a criminal prosecution will generally assure

14

ample vindication of constitutional rights is unfounded in

15

such cases..." and it cites Baggett vs. Bullitt, "...for the

'16

threat of sanctions may deter almost as potentially as the

17

actual application of sanctions, because of the sensitive nat-

18

u±e of constitutionally

id

required that all of those subject to overbroad regulations

20

risk prosecution to test their rights."

21

✓

protected expressions, we have not

For free expression of transcendant value to all society

22

and not merely to those exercising their rights might be the

23

loser. We have fashioned this exception to the usual rules

24

governing standards, and it says see United States vs. Rands,

25

because of the danger of tolerating in the area of First Amend-

12

1

merit, freedoms the existence of a penal statute susceptible to

2

a sweeping and improper application..»" cited NAACP vs Putmam,

O

"e».if the rule were otherwise, the contours of regulation

4

would have to be hammered out case by case and tested only by

5

those hardy enough to risk criminal prosecution to determine

@

the proper scope of regulation.1’

7

Now it is with that in mind. Your Honors, that 1 further

8

point out to the Court the language in Golden vs Zwickler

9

as -follows; "The difference between an abstract question and

10

a controversy contemplated by the Declaratory Judgement Act

11

12

is necessarily one of degree and it would be difficult, if
'
4it would he possible, to fashion a precise test for determin­

13

ing every case whether there is such a controversy."

14

the question in each case is whether the facts alleged under

15

all the circumstances show that there is a substantial con­

16

troversy between parties having adverse legal interests of

17

sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of

18

a declaratory judgement, citing Maryland Casualty eompany

19

vs. Pacific Oil.

Basically

20

Now, Your Honors, with those two cases in mind, I address

21

your attention to what has been characterised as a Siorabrowski-

22

type complaint and I want to say, Your Honors, as it has qome

23

out here, the particular injunction involved here, as can

24

be seen from page 104 of the appendix, did not only deal with

25

Chapter 38 section {12-6) of the Illinois penal ,^ode, it dealt
13

1

2
3
4

5
6
7

8
9

10

with Chapter 38 section (25-1) (a) 12) , Chapter 38 section
(12-6)(a)(3)f and also, Your Honors, which this injunction
did not deal with but another one issued by a single judge,
Judge Wilk, dealt with two ordinances of the City of Chicago*
Now the background of this case is a —. In 1967, there were
a series of arrests and we'd like to point out to Your Honors
the facts involved in this particular case*
We-have alleged, Your Honors, in the record, I’ll give
you the page number for each particular circumstance, but
starting with page 12 and paragraph 27 of our complaint, we

11

deal there with a mass arrest situation that occured on the

12

first day of August, 1967» And certain plaintiffs were arrested

13

and charged as the complaint states with four violations of

14

law, under Illinois law, two statutes, and two ordinances.

15

They were charged with the mob-action statute, the resisting

16

arrest statute, the disorderly conduct ordinance, and the

37

resisting arrest ordinance* Now on the fourteenth day of Sep­

18

tember, 1967, there was another incident where there was a

19

mass arrest situation. I might back up and say that the first

20

incident was colloquially called the "Big Jim" incident, be­

21

cause there, a Negro had been shot by a white man, and people

22

had gathered to peacably, and I emphasize peacably, protest

23

againsttthis unlawful shooting of Julius Woods, a Negro citizen

24

25

Nov; in the incident which occured on September 14, 1967,
it occured at Forty-third Street in Chicago, Forty-third and
14

1

2
3
4
5

Langley and there was a gathering there for the peaceful and
lav/ful demonstration to protest against the unlawful attack
and brutal beating of an eighteen-year-old Negro woman who
resided in the community by police officers,,
The other incident is the incident of May 21, 1967, and

6

there was a gathering ar Fifty-first Street and South Park

7

Avenye, in the City of Chicage, to peacably protest for a re­

8

dress of grievances in that they wanted to rename Washington

9

Park to a name that they felt would be more relevant in loca-

JO

tion and character to a predominant number of Negro residents

11

who resided in the vicinity of that park, Thera was another

12

mass arrest in that situation.

13

On August 23rd, 1967, there was a gathering at One Hun­

14

dred Eleventh Street in the City of Chicago to protest and to

15

inquire with respect to the unlawful shooting of another Negro

16

youth and resident of that community.

17

On August 4, 1967, there was a gathering, peacefully, at

18

a playground to protest that there are not sufficient play­

19

grounds located in certain sections of the City of Chicago.

20

Particularly, this one was at 3501 South Wallace Street in

21

Chicago, and the protest was against the lack and absence of

22

adequate playground facilities in the black community.

23

Now I'd like to point out that in each and every one of

24

these particular arrests that took place in the summer of 1967,

25

all of the people who were arrested en masse the follwoing

-

15

i

felinos happened* ‘They were all charaed with four identical
charges, mob-action, state resistino arrest, citv: ordinance

Now, then, we ero ahead and say, paragraph 25, found on

4
5

pace 12, to resojrt to this plan or scheme the defendants have

6

attempted to threaten and continue to attempt to prosecute

7

the p “tintiffs and all persons associated with fcfee1-» are working

8

in cooperation therewith under color and authority of certain

9

statutes, namely as set forth, chapter 38, section"'(25) \&) (i)

10

and

(2), chapter 38 section

I!

(12-4), and

(31-1), chapter 38 section (12-2),

(12-6) which is the one that we’re before vour

12

honors on, And certain ordinances of the city of'chieacro, to

18

wit, chapter 193-1 , and chapter 11-33, said statutes and or­

14

dinances are set •forth in an appendix marked exhibit and et

15

cetera.

16

Now, then, Your honors,—-

17

o.

Mr. Reid, except for you conclusorv statement on the
y

18

top of pace 31 and perhaps elsewhere in your complaint that

19

these statutes are unconstitutional, the crraviment of what

20

vou’ve been saving to ns is a consnii-acv on the part of these

21

people to harrass vcur clients in chicaao and others similiarly

22

situated bv abueino criminal statutes. And that could have been

23

just as true if these had been shpplifiinor statutes or ?wn(i

M
25

lareenv statutes or anythin© else. If they’re coin© to make
false ch areres apainsfc vou and conspire to misuse'statutes it
18

1

doesn’t follow at all that the statutes are unconstitutional,

i

■

2

does it/’

3

A„

well, vonr «onor, we later allege in this complaint

that the statutes on their face were overbroad-*--

S

0=

You don’t allece that—»-

8

P„

We do--—

0»

. .
j
But all these wrongs that you’ve been talking about

7

8

could equally have taken place with respect to abusing perfect­

S

ly valid, eonoeedly valid statutes such as grand larceny.

10

A.

That is true-—-

0.

Is that correct?

12

ho

That is correct, Your Honor—-

1.3

Qo

These wrongs don't have anything to do necessarily

1!

O

14

with the constutionality of the statutes that vou allege in

15

this complaint that these defendants were intending to abuse,

16

in order to harrass your clients.

17

P0

I beg to differ with Your Honor, but I think it does,

18

because I think that as said by this Court in Colder*, vou have

W

to take all of the facts and circumstances into account. This

20

is a unique case, ^his case max» never happen again in a hun­

21

dred years, but what I’m saving is that vou have to

22

time, -and I’m asking Your Honors to do this in vour own minds’

23

eve, to 1967 in the summer in Chicago and ask yourself what was

24

happening to those neonle then. ff,hv does this Issee standing

25

apparently overlooked by the Pistriet Court, why ®?ere there no
19

cto

back in

1
2

reeruiregents of proof by the court?
And the answer is obvious — the court we31 knew what was

3

happening in fhicaoo, and court well knew, and perhaps the •

4

States' attorney then eoneeeded the point, that he didn't want

5

us to bring in our evidence of what the threat was and now.they

Q

oet up here and get a clean shot at us by saying that the

7

threat is new a conclusion instead of a statement of fact» Your

8

honor, I say that when we say we were threatened, 1 say that is

9

an allegation, a.fact in our complaint. It is not a conclusion

10

of law. I am saying that you look at the totality of the cir­

11

cumstances to back up the total four corners of the complaint,

12

you say does this complaint state a cause of action upon which

13
!4
15

relief can be granted?
And in the federal system, I understand we8 re not obligat­
ed to plead evidence, but to pleag in simple language the
i

16
17

fact that there is a case or controversy upon which the Court
is asked to render a ruling, and I'm saying that tihen we stood

IS

before that ^hree Judge ^ourt there was in fact a sincere and

19

obvious case and controversy involving the mob-action statute,

20

involving the resisting arrest statute, involving ordinances of

21
22
23
24
25

the oitv of Chicago.
mqw

to give uo on your appeal on those matters on the

merits and then to aopeal on one issue and one issue alone and
to sav " Ah Ha" nobody was ever charged with intimidation, the
therefore they had .no standing, well, I’m saying that it would
20

1

he really an abuse of the courts to go back arse* then say "Well

2

now, arrest somebody and we812 now go back through this ar­

3

duous process to get at the intimidation statute which is ob­

4

viously on its face bad,.”

5

It would be just like a surgeon going into a man’s ab­

6

dominal

7
8

something else and closing up the man and then going back next
f
week and opening up the abdominal eavitv to take Out the bad

9

.appendix- And thay mey even amount to medical malpractice, but

©vity and seeing a bad appendix when he’s in there for

10

I'm savind is’s a similar situation here. It’s a question of

II

pendant jurisdiction. The court had before it an issue, it had

12

the jurisdiction of not only the parties but the subject matter

S3

involving clearly the mob-action statute and clearly the other

14

matters that were before the court.

15

Now, what makes this case unioue is that the court then

16

in the fact of pendant jurisdiction dealt with an obvious issue

17

and took care of all our ills at one time which I suggest to

18

the court is a better wav to do it, then they come up and say
'

V.

19

we walked in out of the street and we only attached section

20

12-6 and nobodv over threatened us, nobody was ever arrested,

21

there was no bond held, there was none of this background and

22

ask you to trv this case in a vacuum. And x say

23

be tried in a vacuum, it cannot be carried in a vicuum, but you

M

must understand that tohat the court did in my humble opinion,

25

was the onlv thing they' could have done, other than to have put
21

that it cannot

1

us to additional expense and to put the court to additional

2

time with additional burdens upon the court and upon this

3

Court.

4

Now that is really the gravimenfc of my argument that this

3

case is unique and that our standing to sue stands on the issue

6

of pendant jurisdictione We were properly in court, and the

7

court took care of all our ills and the court in fact saved it­

3

self some time because new X come to the argument which even

3

the States Attorney wants me to reach and that is that on the

10

face of this particular statute there is the question of wheth­

U

er or not it is in fact

12

Your Honors that it was both, and the court in its opinion,

13

written by three judges, came to the conclusion that it was

14

both overbroad and vague„

overbroad and vague. And I submit to

IS

Now here is the problem with that intimidation statute.

16

The problem is this, whenever vou take an intimidation stat­

n

ute or an extortion statute or what have you and vou put it in

18

the policies! arena as they have done here and the victim of

19

that alleged crime becomes a polieieian, either on the state

20

or local level, or the national level, then you have really set

21

the collision in motion of the right of our society to deal

22

with freedom of speech on an ordered libertv and the right of

23

the people to be free from threats so Your Honors, as you have

24

said in cases involving liable and slander, dealing with people

25

who are public figures.
22

(

1

Once you enter the public arena.» you're not to be coddled

2

and protected because yon are a public institution. And so I

3

say that- you cannot sav that these politicians are so

4

that we can’t tell than directly or indirectly that unless

5

you redress our grievances we will do this and so.

6

Now this brines us to the area in the statute --- that

7

section which the court found to be overborad says that, we

8

will cosmu.it any crime,, and this sends us bach not only to the

9

criminal code, it sends us bach ho all regulator!/ legislation

10

which has a sanction of criminal punishment there!n* it sends

11

•us back to all the ordinances of the City of Chicago, which

12

mav or may not be coddled, which have sanctions, and> 1 submit

13

to vois there is no wav with regard to vaorance that you ©an

14

then detenu in

15

in this particular section is five years in prison.

16

when you’ve committed a crime and the sanction

Now the crime that you may threaten to commit if it goes

17

to fruition mav only be a fine of $25 or maybe up to a year

18

in jail. Then to convert speech into a felony — I mean this

19

is what we’re really takking about here-—- vou’re dealing

20

with politicains who say that now if 1 threaten a. politician

2!

I'm going to commit a crime that has a $25 penalty, and now I

22

can get five years, well, obviously we were cheered by this and

23

it was a chilling effect of the threat of this that we had to

24

beat them to the courthouse. Now whether or not we were too

25

fast in getting to the courthouse first, I don’t bftink Your
.

23

I

1

Honors have to reach, that because we were properlv in court

E

on the mob-action statute, and on all the other statutes that

3

the court dealt with, and I felt that, and 1 feel now, that the

4

court had a ricrht and a dufcv, not only a right, but a duty,

5

to deal on the basis of, pendant jurisdiction with this other

8

latter and there was an actual case and controversy based on

7

our allegations of meetings, threats and clans and also these

8

facts are somewhat important, the uniform charges on all these

9

people in all these incidents»

10

You see there were four charges on all these incidents

11

that went before, and it just doesn’t happen that wav generally

32

unless there is some concerted action. Everybody who was invqli

13

ved in this jtoype of matter violates four charges each and

14

everv time, and everybody although he may be a college stu­

15

dent with no prior record had a bond of $10,000 set against him

16

and he stays in jail for ten days before he can srabe bond or

17

get ignored on a petition and therefore lose this time in

18

school,

19

So I’m. saying that there was an actual case or contro­

a©

versy, there were litigants who clearly represented the rights

21

of al3 the people that we sued on behalf of, and whether or

22

not no one was arrested because of one statute, that had been

23

threatened bo be used in the future, you see wa then get of

24

the horns of a

25

ute which says if they be through the court vou cannot get an

dilemma of the 2283, the anti-injunction stat­

24

I
2
3
4

o&junction, if vou be q one to court vou have no standi no.
Now X submit , vour Honors, that this is a ore carious and
it's a wrongful position that people were to be put in because,*
as advocates of First Amendment freedoms, which is the

S

touchstone of our very democracy, if we are qoincr to deny by

6

this dilemma the court system and the judicious use of the

7

court system because I recognize also that we cannot immmd&te

8

this Court with these types of cases, because then this Court

9

would have to cease to function because of the shpff] ina pap­

io

ers . Rut X submit that that is an apparent but unreal feeling

H

because first of all you have to run this crauntlet, you have to

12

go through a Three Judge Court which must be converted by a

13

single judge before he will even conveen a Three Judge Court.

14

One of the judges sitting on that Three Judge Court is a

15

mdm.ber of the Court of Appeals, Now these judges, at least the

16

majority of these three judges must then rule on the matter be­

27

fore the matterwwi11 get here as a matter of ritht. Now if the

18

matter'is frivolous,,and no three Judge Court is convened, then

19

we don't have a. Matter of Sight Appeal, here. We would then

20

have to cro th the Court of Appeals,

2!

If it was not frivolous and a Three Judge Court decided

22

the issue, then X submit to Your Honors that you have got a

23

screening device. You'ere got a Three Judge Court here which

PA

is convened and then the matter is not frivolous and then Your

25

Honors have the duty to hear it because that carving out of
25

I

First Amendment freedoms' that we’re dealing with I cannot em­

2

phasize how important it is because if we cut off the valve

3

and s&v that vou cannot get to this court in matters of free­

4

dom of speech or redress of grievances,, peaceful assembly

5

and I’m not talking about anarchy and I'm not talking about

6

violence or anything like that.

7

Ifm talking about legitimate peaceful First Amentment

8

rights that we all suggest are tribulations. Then everybody

9

will then say well, if I cannot use the courts, what is my next

fO

remedy? And the next remedv may then well ;be that we have to

II

all become revolutionaries as they did in 1776 and overthrow

U2

the entire government because the courts, if they don’t give

13

you a remedy, a speedy remedv, an open remedy, one that von

14

can count and rely on as advocates and lawyers, thep I suggest

15

what do you tell your clients when they say the doors have been

16

closed, let us take to the streets?

17

And it’s with that in .mind that I say to you you have a

10

duty in nombrowski, I must say when I read the opinion X felt

19

that it was a long time eomino but I’m saying you have no right

20

in light of what's happening todav to turn back the clock with

21

respect to mpmbrowski. You have a duty to open that door wi­

22

der. Thank you very much.

FURTHER ARGUMENT BY WAS pPANNICAN, FSQ

2

aw behalf of appellants

3

A,

Thank you, Your Honor. It's been sugaested that the

4

question the standing of the plaintiffs to raise this consti­

5

tutional objection to the Illinois Intimidation Statute,, this

6

subsection ought to be sustained on pendant jurisdiction. And

7

I think I disagree with that. I don't think it's called for.

©
9

First of all, Dombrowski and Zwickeer were, as the Court
said, extraordinary cases. Nobody here has been charged with

10

a violation of this intimidation statute. Nobody has been

n

charered with a violation of this subsection. I think to take

12

an extraordinary steo like was taken in Dombrowski, that alone

13

I think as the court recognised in the opinion that it was tak­

14

ing a significant new step. To say now that we can drag in all

15

sorts of challenges to state statutes on the concept of pen­

16

dant. jurisdiction, I just think it's uncalled for.
I think that this would create a monster that the court

17
18

would never be able to control if it incorporates the challeng­

18

es to statutes whether they be used or not, or whether they ev­

EO

er had been used acrainst the plaintiffs in a complaint drawn

21

like the complaint in the Lower Court, and so we want an adju­

22

dication of all these statutes whether or not they are consti­

23

tutional. I think that that's a step that this Court shouldn't

24

take „

25

now

so far as what was ooing on in Chicago in 1967, Mr.
21

?

Reid has been talking about a lot of things here that 1 ^on’t

2

know if they ©eeured or not, but they put us in a bad light.

3

The fact rcmaiss, however, that one fact that -the Court can-

4

take notice of, is an appeal to the United States Court of

5

Appeals for the Seventh circuit which was decider! on February

6

5, 1970 in Cause #17346 entitled Boyle vs Landry, This was

7

another aspect of this ease where the Court decided that cer­

8

tain sections challenged in this action ware constitutional.

9

It remanded the ease to the single Judge Court and said not you

determine whether or not theyvre being applied unconstitution­
ally and there were hearings held and witnesses brought in,
the people who had been arrested, and they said "We were peace­
fully demonstrating. We sreren5t doing anything, and the police
aame along and charged us with violations of. all these statutes
Which the Three Judge Court had just held were constitutional,
and we weren’t doing anything except exercising out First
Amendment rights, and we were being charged with these things.5'
'And the single judge said that shows—-we didn’t offer any ey
|idence whatsoever,

'
;
t(fe said that .the courts would submit to the bar of 2283,
The court was conducting probable caude hearings and when they
says there was no probable cause for the arrest that indicates
that this is a bad face prosecution and therefore they enjoined

24

us from prosecuting even under these valid constitutional stat­

25

utes .
28

1

The Dnited States Court of Appeals for the Seventh

Circuit reversed that, 'But they also said that there was no

was ooen, to present all the sort of evidence what was going
