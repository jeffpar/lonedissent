ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, MSQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. LAWRENCE G. WALLACES Thank you., Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.
This case is brought by the Secretary of Labor under

Title 4, sometimes called the Union Democracy provisions of

m

the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959,

14

it was brought to set aside the 1967 election of officers of

15

the Respondent Local Union.
After the election, a member of the Local who aad

restrictive meeting attendance requirement had been imposed

as a condition for candadicy.

After investigating the election, the Secretary

concluded that there was probable cause to beleive that the

3

Act had been violated with respect to each of these matters,

6

and he advised the Respondent Unions of these findings and

7

invited them to discuss the findings and to take internal

8

remedial action.
When, after discussions,

Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals

upheld the Secretary8 s complaint with respect to the vise of

Union facilities to promote the candadicy of the incumbent

15

president. The election for that office was accordingly ordered

16

set aside on that ground, and that aspect of the judgement

17

below is not at issue in

this Court.

What is at issue

18

are the rulings of the Courts

19

with respect to the validity of the meeting attendance re­

authority or standing to raise that issue in this litigation,

ing

18

28 and 29 of the brief, Section 402 of the Act, and I wish

19

first to direct the Courts attention to

20

28»

21

issue can be found in the Appendix to our brief, on pages

402 (b), on page

And there the governing statutory language is that

22

after a member of the organization has filed a complaint?, the

23

Secretary shall investigate such complaint, and if he finds

24

probable cause to believe that a violation of this Title has

25

occurred and has not been remedied, he shall, within a certain

e

1

time, bring a suit»

2

As we point out in our brief, this statutory language

3

is consistent with our position that the Secretary has au­

4

thority, supports our position that the Secretary has auth­

5

ority to raise, in the lawsuit, any violation "which his

S

investigation discloses to have occurred in the election of

7

earning which the complaint had been filed, and we noted, also,

8

that in the course of the legislative history, Congress had

9

before it a draft of an alternative bill which would have lim­

10

ited the lawsuit to the particular allegation

made in the

?!

complaint, and while there is no explicit reason given in the

12

course of the legislative history for the choice of this

13

language rather than the alternative language, we think there

14

is significance in the fact that this broader formulation was

15

chosen by Congress.

16

Q

Do I understand you correctly that if there

17

is no complaint filed, the Secretary has no investigatory

18

powers under Section 402

19
20

A

(b)?

Well, he does have investigatory powers,

but he wouldn’t have powers to bring any lawsuit. He would

i

21

have powers only to advise the Union if he believed that the

22

Union's proceedures were not in accordance with the Act.

23
24
25

But those powers are conferred under another Section
of the Act, which is not reproduced in our Appendix, Section 601
Q

then you're in a position to where the

7

1

2

presence of a complaint is your starting point. You have
to have this.

3

A

Under section 402,, in order for the Sec­

4

retary to have authority to bring this lawsuit, that is

S

correct.

6
7

Q

And having the complaint your argument

is that you go off into points not raised in the complaint.

8

A

Well—

8

Q

Without hairing the complaint you can'1

io
If

do this at all.
A

Well, the Secretary can investigate, in­

12

form the Union,, but cannot bring a lawsuit in the absence

13

of a complaint, but that is our argument and

14

elaborate on the reasons for it in just a moment.

I'll

15

Q

And -—- the government—

16

A

Well, without exhaustion by the Union,

17

member, although in practice, the Secretary always gives

18

the Union an opportunity to remedy the violations he has

19

found internally.

20
21
22

Q

— specific provision for exhaustion,

in there, doesn't tit?
A

It certainly does, Mr. JusticeHarlan.

23

This lawsuit never could have been brought by the Secretary

24

if the complaint had been rectified internally by the Union

25

to the satisfaction of the complaining member.

8

?

Q

2

A

We do not dispute that,

3

Q

Well, the member can't go to the Sec­

4
5

Well—

retary until after he, the member, has exhausted—
A

That is correcto And presumably never
t

6

would have gone to the Sectetary if the Union had redres­

7

sed the specific violation of which he complained.

8

Q

Well, independently before you, as I

understand it, the Secretary, su responde, may make an in­
10

vestigation as in Section 6 1?

11

A

12

Q

As in. Section 6 1, yes,

sir.

And then he does the same thing, vir­

13

tually that a Union member is complaining of something. At

14

least he did it -— with the Union officials——

15

A

His authority-—

1

Q

he will not ---

17

A

That is correcto Exceptunlike the

Union

18

member he does not have ultimate redress to anyone who car

19

then bring a lawsuit. If the negotiations are unsuccessful.

2

Now before we leave the fact of the statute, we

21

think there is another provision in Section 4 2 which has

22

great bearing on this question, that is on page 29 of our

23

brief, Subsection (c)

24
25

(2).

And that indies,tes that if the Secretary’s suit, is
suecassful, the Court shell sex aside the election declare

9

1

the electiori if any * to be: void, and then direct the conduct

2

of a new election under the supervision of the Secretary.

3

And so far as lawful and -™ in conformity with

4

the Constitution and by-laws of the labor organization. Nov/

5

this raises a considerable problem, if the scope of the law­

6

suit brought; by the Secretary is to be limited only to the

7

complaint raised, by the Union member.

8
9

Because the Secretary is eharged if he is success­
ful in that lawsuit, w&ih supervising a new

10

comformity with the Constitution;

11

they are lav/ful.

12

election in

'and by-laws insofar as

And in this instance the Secretary was of the view

13

that the meeting attendance requirement as a condition of

14

candidacy was not lawful. His alternative, if he could not

15

raise that issue in the litigation, would be either to super­

16

vise the election applying what he believed to be a candidacy

17

qualification violated the act, or to delay the election while

18

this issue is separately litigated before the new election

19

is conducted, which we think would be inconsistent with

20

Congress“ purpose to expedite the provision of relief under

21

this statute.

22

Once the District Court has, in fact, found a.

23

violation, the statute provides that there can be no stay

24

in the .District Courts judgement setting aside the election

25

and ordering a new one, while that judgement is appealed.

10

1

Q

If he testified the election of the

3

law, without setting aside the election results, even if

4

he was right about being able to litigate the meeting atten­

6

does it necessarily follow that he might set aside the ele­

There is a broader public interest to be served by

7

the Secretarys intervention once it’s warranted, then as the

8

Court put the matter in the Glass Bottle Blowers Case) in
(
39 US, although Congress was committed to minimal intervention,
*
i.

9
10

it was obviously equally committed to making that intervention

11

once warranted effective in carrying out the basic aim of

12

Title 4 which is to assure free and democratic union elections.
Perhaps themmost significant thing about the legis­

13

U

lative history ot Title 4 is that Congress chose to invest

15

the enforcement authority in the Secretary rather than the

16

individual complainant.
One time a bill was passed through the House,

17
18

which would have made the rights enforceable by private suit,

19

but as finally enacted, the law recognized that there is a

20

borader public interest to be served, and not merely the re­

2?

dress of

individual grievances.
Q

22

Mr. Wallace, there are other matters besides

23

the election of officers that

24

not so?

25

have been challenged, is that

The kind that you3re applying, for example.
A

Well, there are other matters that can be

12

I

challenged.

2

Q

So 1 take it that your theory is that

3

if a member of a Union makes a complaint about one particular

4

type of expenditure which he considers unlawful

5

that once the inquiry is made by the Secretary, he can

6

pursue every instance of improper expenditure that he en­

7

counters o

8
9

A

and improper

Well, we need not go that far, Mr. Chief

Justice, that is perhaps a more difficult case. Here the

10

challenge by the Secretary is limited to the 1967 election.

11

All of these officers were elected in the same 1967 election,

12

the validity of which is in question, and it has been question­

13

ed by the Secretary on the ground that an unlawful meeting

14

attendance requirement was imposed as a

15

the candidacy qualification, and this applied to all of the

16

candidates elected in that election.

condition for

And Title 4 does not limit the investigation of

17

18

theft or unlawful use cf Union funds, there needn't be a

19

complaint before the Secretary -— have jurisdiction, under

20

the Act.

21

—- something about Union funds. So this really

22

relates to the setting aside of elections and the holding

23

of new, supervised elections.

24

25

Now there was a subsidiary purpose of fostering
Union self government, in the 4ct. We recognize that; it wasn't

13

the dominant purpose.
We recognize that if everyone is satisfied, the
election cannot be disturbed, or if everyone can be made
satisfied through internal procedures, the election cannot
be disturbed.
But as we elaborate in our brief, we think it would
be innappropriate to

read broader implications than this,

into the exhaustion requirement.
That is, the requirement that the

member

exhaust Union remedies. Because this is very different; from
the normal exhaustion of administrative remedy situation „
The Congress has not conferred, in fact finding, or
any other kind of governmental authority on the Unions, on
these private organizations.
Q

Does a member have the right to present to

the Secretary anything other than the issue that he has net
exhausted within the Union?
£

Well the Secretary will entertain com­

plaints , bu& even if the complainant i„n this case had
not raised the question of the candidacy qualifications, the
Secretary would embrace that within his investigation, and
this Court and others have indicated that his investigatory
powers are broad, and if he concluded that there was a violation,
he would include that in the allegations of the lawsuit.
Q

The member filing the complaint with the

14

1

Secretary* if he has exhausted

2

of the president's election* and then he files with the

3

Secretary* is he free to force the Secretary to investigate

4

some issue he didn't exhaust on?

3

A

within the union the question

Well* the Secretary views -- responsi­

0

bility as investigating the entire validity of the election.

1

So that the member isn't forcing the Secretary* whether he

8

adds the additional one or not.

9

Q

Well let's say the Secretary does* I'm

There is-no.

point in investigating something which
6

12
13

ont its face doesn't raise an issue——
Q

Well let's just take this case, Mr „

14

Wallace. A member comes to him with a complaint about the

15

president's election and the

16

exhauated on the meeting rule within the Union.

meeting rule. And he hasn't

17

A

That is correct.

18

Q

-- the Secretary say Well it sounds like

19

a clear violation but I'm just not investigating that because

20

you didn’t exhaust it. May he do that?

21

A

Well, I suppose he may? he never has. That

22

issue has never arisen. And it's hard for me to concieve that

23

the SEcretary would do that. His responsibility is to try to

24

redress violations, at least through conciliatory means.

25

Q

Mr. Wallace, suppose a complaint is filed

16

1

the presidents election was illegal becuase he wasn't quali­

2

fied to run. And that was papers show in the complaint that

3

that had been exhuasted within the Union,, But then they

included 5 other complaints, about notice, improper voting,

5

and everything else»

1?

Could the Secretary go to Court that unless it
had been

exhausted within
A

the Union?

Yes, he could, Mr. Justice, under our

view of the statute.
Now, you,I believe it should be kept in mind that
the Secretary does invariably afford an aopportunity for the
Union to remedy anything that he deems a violation before

3
14

he sues, as he did here„
The Union has the same opportunity that it would

5

have had, if the member had presented that specific complaint.

6

Along with his other complaints. The same opportunity to

17

redress it internally.

18

Q

19
0
1

But the statute requires exhaustion on

each one of those points, that you —— .
A

No, the statute does not say exhaustion

of each point. The statute says

a member who has exhausted

22

his remedy, his internal remedy, can file a complaint with

23

the SEcretary and then the Secretary

24

finds probable cause to believe that a violation has occurred,

5

may bring a lawsuit.
17

after his investigation

1

2
3

Q

A violation.

A

A violation. It doesn't say the violation '

alleged, or brought.

4

Q

5

A

6

A violation plus 4 others.
Any violation. Surely "a" means more than

one if two violations were alleged initially.

7

Q

Going back to my hypo, the secretary finds

8

that the president was a valid candidate , and found no sub­

9

stance in that complaint, but did find substance in the other

10

4, that the Union member made no effort to exhau&fc on. What

11

happens?

12

A

The Secretary can bring a lawsuit because

13

there has been dissatisfckCtion on the part of a member of the

14

local with this election and the Secretary upon investigating

15

it found that there was indeed reason to believe that the

16

statute was violated. Maybe the dissafected Union member did

17

not concieve the accurate basis on which there was a violation

18

in that case.

19

Q

Well do you think that, the only thing .

20

that is required is to trigger it, with the filing of a

21

complaint?

22

Hi

That is the only thing required, now as a

23

matter of policy the Secretary does not bring a lawsuit in a

24

situation where the complaint itself was in his view completely

23

without merit. But under our view of the statute he has the

18

I

authority to do this. As we point out in our brief, we think

2

it would be inappropriate to read too much into this exhaus­

3

tion requirement.

4
5

So long as internal rectification, opportunity for
internal rectification is afforded to the Union,

6

Q

What you're really saying is that the

1

exhaustion provision in the context of this statute is a notice

3

provision.

9
10

h

Well that is correct. It's not a situation

comparable to exhaustion in a governmental agency.

II

Q

Mo.

12

A

The ---

it’s completely de novo. It's

13

not a suit to review the Unions determination. It's not a

14

suit limited to the record that was made before the Union.

15
16

It's not a classical case of the exhaustion of admin-'
istrative remedies at all.

17

Q

But the statute does-— exhaustion terms.

18

A

Well, that is a familiar word; But given

19

the entire purpose of the statute, the dominant purpose of

20

Congress was to insure free and democratic elections,, and there

21

was a subsidiary purpose here which we believe the Secretary

22

honors in his practices

23

and not intervening if everyone in the local is satisfied

24

with the result.

25

of permitting Union self government

All of these purposes are served by the approach that

19

1

the Secretary takes» But the dominant purpose would be served

2

by the view that the. Secretary cannot assure the free and

3

democratic election under the Statute,, as the statute requires

4

it, because of shortcomings in the initial complaint»

S

But in fact, the Secretary has given the Union

6

the opportunity to rectify its shortcomings» It comes down

7

to

8

about the shortcomings.

almost a technicality as to from whom the Union heard

9

In terms of the purposes of the Act—-

10

Well, there is another issue in this case, and

11

my time for discussing it is qxiite limited, but we believe it's

12

a very important issue» And it's an issue under Section 401 of

13

the Act, page 27 of our brief, whether this requirement as it

U

was imposed, is a requirement aufchourized by the Act es a

15

reasonable qualification uniformly imposed»

IS

We believe that it wasn't under the approach taken

17

by this Court in the Hotel Workers Case, 391 US, which elab­

18

orated at some length the narrowness of this statutory excep­

1©

tion, and the fact that Congress took as its model demoeratic

20

elecitons in which a requirement of this sort which disquali­

21

fied the majority no

22
23
24
25

'

matter how you look at it, of possible

candidates, would be unthinkable in ordinary political ele­
ctions .
This kind of a question is a campaign issue, rather
than a basis for disqualification» And if I may, I5li save the

MR. GOTTESMAN; Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Congress was thinking about when it enacted it.
Over and over we hear that the broader public inter­

12

eat is the correction of all violations in Title 4. And this

13

little subsidiary thing over here about exhaustion of remedies

U

which somehow crept into the statute, and somehow the Secre­

IS

tary of Labor is stuck with it,

16

indeed limit his power to proceed at certain distances, but

17

because it's such a little subsidiary thing, then by all means

18

it should be so narrowly construed that it -limits in only where

19

the Court has to say that it limits it.

20

and somehow it does

.. .

Now I would suggest that if one examines the legis­

21

lative history of this statute, that that doesn't accurately

22

balance the two concerns that Congress had. To be sure, Con­

23

gress was concerned with what it had Sound in ^he McClellan

24

committee haarings. There were, if found, and it said, a min­

25

ority in unions which have very undemocratic election procedures
21

s

the effect of which was that the incumbents were able to

2

entrench themselves and the membership is not allowed to have

3

a voice in selecting its governors.

4

And for that reason, Congress said, and it said it

5

was doing it very reluctantly, it imposed what is undoubtedly

6

the most elaborate set of procedures and provisions and re­

7

quirements governing the elections of any non-public body

8

in

the United States.

9

The Congress realized .in a sense,the enormity of what

10

it was doing. It was making a quite unprecedented intrusion

il

into the affairs of What had been thought to be private insti­

12

tutions .

13

And so throughout the debates and thsebughoufc

the

14

Senate Report which is really the principal explaiation of

15

Title 4, is v/aiving the concern of Congress the union self-

16

government not be invaded any more than is absolutely nec­

17

essary, to accomplish these basic purposes for which the statute

18

was being enacted.

19

Congress repeatedly said these are private insti­

20

tutions, the overwhelming majority of them are honestly and

21

democratically run, it made a finding based on its hearings

22

that internal union appellate processees were in: fact equipped

23

to and had, in fact, dealt adequately with the sins that had

24

been committed within unions, with only a few exceptions.

25

And in mind of the statute, which as it sought was

22

1

was going to balance, on the one hand its concern that where

2

democracy was not existent that there would be a procedure

3

to assure its existence, and on the other a more critical

4

concern in this statute, that the government not go trampling

5

into the affairs of unions any more than was absolutely nec­

Q

essary .

1

Now to that end it put into this statute exception

8

402 (a), the exhaustion requirement. And perhaps 1 might

9

begin, as Mr. Wallace did, with reading Section 402 (a).

10

It says a member of a labor organization who has

1?

exhausted the remedies available under the constitutions, and

\2

by-laws of such organisation. Not who has exhausted some of

53

the remedies. Not who has exhausted a remedy under one issue.

14

But who has exhausted the remedies of all

15

of them.

And we would suggest that if we are to resort to

16

literalism, and we don't think we should, that that word

17

"available" in there, suggests rather strongly that what Con­

18

gress was saying is you must give the Union all of the oppor­

19

tunities which it affords you. To bring these issues to it

20

for correction in the first instance.

21

And when you have exhausted all of those remedies

22

which are available within the Union, then you may go on to

23

the Secretary of Labor.

24
25

And if it is found that the Union

through the

procedures it provides, has not adequately dealt with an

23

I

allegation of this statute, then in default of its correcting

2

the problem, the Secretary of Labor may move in .

3

There was no default in this case. The --- its rule,

4

vrhich is the issue as to which we have this question was

5

never raised within the Union»

€

And though there is talk about well, we can't ex­

1

pect members to be able to draft complaints to the Unior like

8

lawyers would, we can’t expect them to be articulate, that's

9

not the issue in this case.

10

This

isn't a case the failure to raise this issue

11

is in artful draftsmanship, in a lack of understanding» This

12

was a candidate for the president who had himself qualified

13

under the meeting attendance rule»

14

Ke wasn't complaining about the meeting attendance

15

rule, he was eligible. He was complaining because one of

16

his opponents had run off a leaflet on the Union's mimeograph

17

machine.

18

Q

That's the impression I got from the

19

brief. Ihat there is no dispute that this complaining member

20

was qualified under the rule?

21

A

Absolutely not» He won, ha was on the

22

ballot, and he was defeated. And having been defeated, be

23

challenged the election because his opponent, he challenged

24

it within the Union, because his opponent had run off a leaf­

25

let on the Union's mimeograph machine, and he had not been.

24

f

told, though he knew it had happened, he had not been told

2

that he had permission to do the same.

3

Now, he--—•

4

Q

Is that the only issue?

3

A

Well,

there were other issues which

6

the Secretary agrees that he raised within the Union, that

1

the Secretary agrees were without merit. One of them related

8

to the other issue which the Secretary raised in this law­

9

suit, which was the meeting attendance rule. He complained

10

about the placement of the voting booths, and some other

11

things within the Union.

12

The Union found those complaints without merit and

13

so did the Secretary. But for our relevant purposes he did

14

raise within the Union, the complaint about his opponent using

15

the mimeograph machine. And as the Secretary conceeded in

16

answer to an interrogatory, he did not raise within the Union

17

any question as to the reasonableness of the meeting atten­

18

dance rule. Under which he had in fact qualified.

19

Now the Union heard those issues which he did raise,

20

and concluded that the election should not be set aside, for

21

any of them. He then filed a complaint to the Secretary which

22

the Secretary constsmes

23

of the meeting attendance rule.

24
25

as having raised the reasonableness

I think if you:' read it it’s not that clear .
it raised that,

that

what he was redlly complaing about was

25

1

not the existence of the rule, but the fact that he claimed*

2

and the Court ultimately found to the contary, but he claimed

3

that the rule had not been adequately communicated tc the

4

members so that they didn’t know that they were obligated to

5

attend the meetings in order to run.

6

Prior to the trial we had interviewed the complainant

7

and asked him whether he had intended to raise the reasonable­

8

ness of the rule with the Secretary,, and he said* "No* it’s

9

ag great rule. I’m all for it." and at the trial we began to

10

ask him questions as to whether he felt the rule was necessary

11

for the well-being of the Union.

12

The government objected* and said we don’t think

13

the views of any one man are relevant to the resolution of

14

this question. This is in the record. And therefore we don’t

13

think the Court should allow the complaining witness to

'IS

state whether he is or is not

17

in agreement with this rule.

And the judge sustained that objection. So the re­

18

cord does not show the view of the complainant. I can only

19

state that it was our expectation that had he been allowed

20

to answer that question* he would have said that a man cannot

21

be an adequate officer of this union unless he has attended

22

the meetings.

23

It is doubtful to us that he even raised this question

24

in his complaint to the Secretary* althoughthe Secretary claims

25

that he did.

26

But ia any event raising it in the complaint to
the Secretary is not sufficient compliance with the require­
ments of the statute.
Because the statute quite clearly requires, as we
read it, that a member

have exhausted it within the Union.

And I think this can be most easily demonstrated by examining
the case which the Secretary admits. That is, that if a member
does not exhaust any issue within the Union then the Secretary
condeeds, no matter h®w outrageous that election, no matter
how outrageous the violations of Title 4, the Secretary may
not institute a lawsuit to set that election aside.
He may indeed investigate and publish his condem­
nation of it, but he may not institute a lawsuit to set it
aside«
Q

You do

not view the Secretary's informal

efforts at adjustment as a substitute for the statutory burden
of the member to exhaust the remedies?
A

No, we don’t Your Honor, and I thin] when

I explain what we understand to be the purpose of exhaustion,
it will become clear why we don't view them as an adequate
substitute.
But I might begin by saying that if I understand
the Secretary’s

position, he doesn’t view it as an adequate

substitute, either. In those cases where no issue is exhausted
before the end.
27

i

In other words,, if there is no complaint within

2

the Union, a member simply goes directly to the. Secretary,

3

if we understand the Secretary's position, he

4

that by giving the Union notice before he sues, that that is

5

an adequate substitute for enhaustion.

S

is not claiming

In any event, let's look at that case. No matter

7

how outrageous the violation, if we understand the Secretary,

3

he cannot sue without home complaint within the Union.

9

But now, says theSecretary, if there is a complaint

10

about something, no matter how irrelevant within the Union,

11

if a member files a complaint saying I stubbed my toe on the

12

way to the voting booth, and therefore this election may be

13

set aside. Then, says the Secretary , all of these outrageous

14

things that happened are now open to the correction of the

15

Secretary.

16

Well that seems very salutory, it’s certainly nice

17

to have outrageous violations corrected. But could it concei­

13

vably have been Congress5 intention to adopt so Quixotic

19

a statute,

20

Why would Congress say that no matter how outrageous

21

the election, that unless a member exhausts within the Union

22

the Secretary can’t proceed? But if he exhausts about anything,

23

no matter how irrelegant, that exhaustion

24

the Secretary to come through and then correct all of these

25

things that are otherwise beyond his reach.

28

opens the door for

1

Just for a logical analysis it wouldn't make sense

2

for Congress to make that kind of a distinction. And if one

3

looks indeed at what Congress thought was going to be served

4

by the exhaustion requirement, it becomes clear that not

5

only is it illogical, but it's not what Congress intended.

6

Congress was, as 1 stated earlier- , preoccupied with

7

ite concern to foster Union self-government. And as the Senate

8

Report put it, "To keep the governments hands off Unions, to

9

the maximum extent

10
11

consistent with the requirements of this

statute."
Q

Mr. Gottesman, in this connection,

12

help me along here. In 402 (b), it states, VThe

13

shall investigate and if he finds probable cause to believe

14

that a violation of this Title has occurred,,,.." and so

15

forth. Am I correct in my understanding that this statute

16

formerly spoke of such violation?

Secretary

17

A

No, Your Honor.

18

Q

Such allegation rather than violation?

19

©

No, Your Honor. I believe the governments

20

brief rather got carried away on that point, if I may, I'll

21

explain what happened.

22

This bill was enacted In 1959, and it was the Kennedy

23

Irwin Bill which led to Title 4„ In 1958 there was a bill

24

called the Kennedy-(Ives) bill, introduced and passed by the

25

Senate, but not by the House. And that bill, as passed by the

29

1

Senate had exac&ly this language, which appears in the final

E

statute. But because it was not passed by the House, it came

3

up again in 1959 for reconsideration by the Senate.

4

In 1959, several other proposed bills were also

5

introduced inthe Senate, one wof which was introduced by

6

Senator

7

is the one which the government referrs to.

a

Mundt, and that was Senate Bill Mo. 1002, and that

Senator Mundts bill was completely different firom

9

this. It required no exhaustion of remedies within the Onion

io

at all. But it described some rules abotst how elections were

i?

to be conducted. And it said, if 2% of the memberd of the

12

Union are dissatisfied, or think a violation has occured, they

13

may, by signing a prtition, go tb the SectEtary of Labor,

14

alleging that a violation has occurred.

15
16

And the

Secretary may then bring a lawsuit challeng

ing such violation.

17

Now that is where that language came from that they

18

site as the competing — beforeCongress. That bill, in feet,

19

never sa^r the light of day. It is doubtful if anyone other

20

than Senator Mundt ever read it. At least when the floor

21

debates on the Kenne@$-Irwin bill were going on, Senator

22

Mundt said that his bill had been given short shrift in teh

23

committee and nobody had paid any attention to it, and he

24

was very regretful about that.

25

But the fact is that that bill was never seriously

30

1

before the Senate for consideration.» The language as it appears

2

in its final form had been adopted a year prior to that in

3

1958. It was simply carried forward again in 1959 and readopt­

4

ed by the Saaate without change in any of the salient points.

5

So that, I mean, it dees use the words "a violation” but

6

I don't think you can draw any inference that there is a.

1

conseious decision by Congress to use the words "a violation"

8

rather than

0

be beleived, no one

"such violation." Since, if Senator Mundt is to
else even knew that his bill and

10

his words "such violation" was before the® for competing

11

consideration.

Q

Well why do you think they used the words "a vio­

lation " ?
A

Well I think if youread the words "a violation" in

context, they donit mean any violation. It says the Secretary
shall investigate such complaint, and if he finds probable
cause to believe that a violation has occurred. Now I think
that that, fairly read, and particularly read in light of the
piurpose, means a violation alleged in the complaint.
Q

You mean that as if instead of "a”, if were "the

complaint or violation”?
A

Right. That is certainly a reading of it. If you

had nothing but-—
Q

You're suggesting that that they should have is as

do that, and to decide whether he can do that, you have tc

it says

Isn't your argument on this one sentence

15

of Section (b) which uses "such complaint" in the first line,

16

and "a violation" in the second line, rather at odds with

17

most of the

18

canons of the eonstruction of the statute?
I think not. I think the first and. most

19

basis canon of construction is to discern what Congress in~

20

tended to do, which is discernable from the legislative

21

24
25

history, which I do want to get to in——
Q

Well, isn't

the first job to see what

Congress said?
A
statute as with

Well I think perhaps not so much with this
others. This Court has made very clear

33

1

in other cases dealing with this very section, that this is

2

not a statute which can be read literally. That in view of

3

the competing and contending forces that went into its con­

4

struction and the changes that were made on the floor,, etc.,

5

etc., this is a statute that has to be approached with caution

6

as to its construction.

7

Q

You say it cannot be read literally?

e

A

That's what this Court said, Your Honor.

9

It said labor legislation generally, and this statute in

10

particular cannot be read literally, but must be read in terms

11

of the purposes which Congress sought to serve in its enact­

12

ment. Which can be discerned from the legislative history.

13

Q

What case was that?

14

A

l believe it was the Laborer's case. There

15

were two decided in the same day, Laborers and Glass Bottle

16

Blowers. And in one of those, and perhaps in both, the Court

17

made the statement that it cannot be read literally.
Q

cases, particularly about labor legislation, hasn't it?

As we read the Senate Report, the exhaustion re­

mean, I think that’s why this

quirement was intended tc serve £our functions.

11

1) Congress didn’t want the Secretary to be an agent

12

at large, bringing lawsuits wherever he thought Unions weren’t

13

doing things right. -— As Mr. Wallace said. Congress wanted

14

to allow the Secretary to act where the members were dis­

15

satisfied

16

members are not dissatisfied with the meeting attendance rule,

17

Congress didn’t want the Secretary trampling in, challenging

18

it absent their consent. Now that purpose can’t be served

19

at all if the SEcretary is free to alledge* anything ha wants

20

to alledge, because as here, he can then alledge things to

25

with the way thexr Union was being run. And if the

which there is no indication of

membership dissatisfaction.

The second thing Congress wanted to serve by thia, it
wanted to instill in the membership respect for Union tri­
bunals and it wanted Union tribunals to function as administra­
tive agencies notwithstanding the govermnents assertion to the

35

1

2

contrary.
This Court said that it was

Congress" emphatic in­

3

tention that unions would be the principle enforcement agen­

4

cies of this statute. And so Congress wanted members to see

S

that their tribunals would indeed be available to the resol­

6

ution of these problems.

7

Mow members are not -—- engouraged to take their

8

disputes to the Unions tribunals for solution. If theyknow

9

that they can just throw any old thing into the Union and

10

then go to the Secretary afterward, and heJll take it whether

11

the Union had it or

12

not.

And indeed, when the Unions are in fact behaving in

13

a responsbile fashion, as indeed the Steelworker3s is, and

14

the resolving election disputes, this union over a period of

15

1964 through 1967 it provided corrective action in a majority

16

of election complaints that came to it.

17

tod so it is doing the job that Congress hoped and

18

expected --

burials are just willfully overruled by the Secretary-- law­

is doing a job and they/re going to losfe their

And finally, this statute was designed with very
specific time limits in mind, andthe hope

that Union problems

would be corrected very promptly.

11

And what the Secretary's construction means is, that

12

particular kinds of election problems can be raised for -the

13

first time, many months, in this case it was 4 or 5 months
■

14

after the election has been decided, and long after all the

15

Unions internal correction procedures had been exhausted .

9

is a great rule, Congress quite clearly didn't want the

10

Secretary to be able to get that rule set aside.

11

Even though it might be technically a violation.

12

Q

I don't know how you can say that, because

13

if Congress said you find

14

election — you must carry it out in accordance with the

15

law.

see how you say

Congress didn’t

intend for them to raise the question of the meeting attendance
rule.
A

Well if

this Court concludes that irrespec­

tive of membership satisfaction that a new election must be
conducted in accordance v?ith Title, with every requirement
of Title 4 even though the members might prefer it another
way, then we would have no rproblem with the Court saying
that the adjudication of fchemerrts of this issue can be rnside,

39

t

not for the purpose of setting aside anything because of that

2

adjudication, but for the purpose of obstructing the Union

3

and the Secretary as to how a re-run, ordered for other

4

reasons is to be conducted»

5

And indeed we told that to the Court of Appeals,

6

I recall that we won this case in the District Cosrt on the

7

merits. The District Court said the meeting attendance rule

8

is reasonable. Xn

9

the first time made the argument well, even if we"re not al­

the

Court of Appeals, the government, for

10

lowed to challenge the election on this ground we ought to

11

be entitled to guidance if we're to re-run the election for

32

the president for other reasons we ought to have guidance as

13

to how to do so.

14
IS
16

And we indicated that we had no serious objection
with the Court deciding the Issue for that limited j

purpose.

Wot for the purpose of setting aside the election of all 11

17

officers, which is what the Secretary seeks, initially, but'

18

for the purpose of instructing the parties simply on

19
20
21
22
23
24
25

how the re-run is to be conducted.
Q

*ly understanding of your statement was, I

want to make aure I get it right, that even as regards the
Secretary, this man, who had qualified under the Union rule,
had Made no complaint to the Secretary, putting aside exhaustior
about the rule,-—
A

Well, there's not—

40

1

2

Q

Is that an overstatement or am I mis­

understanding it, or what?
A

3

Well, there is a disagreement between the

4

Secretary and us as to what he complaind about to the Sec­

5

retary. His words were ambiguous.

6

Q

Well what did he complain about?

7

A

He said the Union conducted the election

8

under a rule which was unfair. The meeting attendance rule

9

which was unfair. I'm characterizing it. Because it was not

10

adequately communicated to the members.
Mow the Secretary said he Was complaining about both

11

12

the unfairness of the rule as such and the failure to commun­

13

icate. We say, no, he was only complaining about the failure

14
15

16

to communicate the rule. And we were prepared to have hint
testify and expected fully that he would testify. But he
was only -------

and you would still be here.
A

Absolutely.

Q

In the same —

A

It's irrelevantunder oursbut there is

at least a possible middle ground ofsaying thathe can sue
25

by the Secretary can sue -—■ what is raised in the complaint.
41

1

The Secretary lias sort of alluded to that middle

2

ground and I want to emphasize that even if there were each

3

a middle ground, which we don’t agree, we say that exhausted

4

in the union, even if there were such a middle ground this

5

record would not justify them to allow to sue on that.

6
7
8
9

Now I'd like to turn in ray remaining few moments
to the meeting attendance rule and its reasonableness as such.
The Secretary repeatedly talks about this is just
like hotel employees, this is a case where a rule has disquali­

10

fied, has rendered a majority of the members of a union in­

II

eligible to run for office. And the single thing I would

12

most like to emphasize is that this rule disqualified nobody.

13

Every single member of this union, and the Secretary

14

eonceeded could qualify under this rule, and qualify without

15

difficulty. All he had to do was attend 11

16

course of a 21 month period.

17

meetings over the

The Secretary of Labor had a regulation published,

IS

it xs still published today, expressly stating that a meeting

19

attendance requirement, requiring 50% attendance at the meetings!

20
21

22

over a 2 year period, is a reasonable rule. Unless there is
difficulty in attendance.
We are ironically here defending

the Secretary's

23

published regulation. He ironically is here attacking it. And

24

the basis of his attack is that well it's true that's fchat

25

my regulation says,, but from time to time I change ray mind, and

42

1

indeed, as the record in this case shows he changed it often»

2

On the question whether an otherwise reasonable

3

rule should be seta aside, because infact only a very small

4

percentage of the members choose to qualify themselves under

5

it, by attending the meetings»

6

Six months before this election was held, the

7

Secretary stated that he had conducted a review and had deter-

8

mined that the small percentage should not invalidate the rule»

9

Precisely because anybody could attend who wanted to and if

10

they chose not to, that's their own choice»

11

After we held our election he changed his mind agains

12

and decided to sue us» So we got caught betwixt arid between»

13

What we did was lawful whan done, but unlawful whan the Sec™

14

retary changed his mind.
Q

15
16

Mr» Gottesman, if we reach the merits,

should this Court pass on them or should we remand?
A

17

We strongly urge you to pass on them. And

18

the reason we urge it is that the Secretary has now brought

19

lawsuits against 15 steelworker local unions, challenging

20

this identical meeting attendance rule, they're in just

21

about every circuit, in the United States. And we will be invol-

22

ved in endless litigation over this issue, which will undoubted­

23

ly result in a conflict and will undoubtedly get back here,

24

anyway.

25

And since the issue is before the dourt at this time,

43

1

2
3

if youcconclude that the issue ©d properly raised and there­
fore before you, we strongly urge that you reach it and de­
cide it*

4

Q

Does Mr, Wallace join you in this?

5

A

Yes, ha doss. 1 think he does. He does.

6

One thing I'd like to say about percentages because that'©

7

really the only argument that hethe Secretary's §ot here,

8

a small percentage in fact chose to qualify, The fact is thfcfc

9

of the 27 people who sstught to run for office, 23 qualified.

10

And thatprowprooves a rather salient fact which is, there;8 s

1!

only a small percentage of people in any institution who want

12

to tun for office, and of those who do, given reasonable re­

13

quirements for qualifying, the vast majority will, in fact,

14

qualify.

15
16
17

Q

Qfely

What's the oghtother union that has the

3 year---?
A

X honestly don't recall. There is one

18

other with a 2 year rule, but this election is o&ly a 21 month

19

rule, cbecuase it was in the local union. So the Court nefed not

20

in this case determine the reaaonablemess of the 3 year rule,

21

bat only a 21 month rule. Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Gottesman. Mr. Wallace, you

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.

S

■ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. WALLACE: thank you, Mr. Chied Justice»
The Respondent’s reading
us perhaps to

of the statute seems to

be an appropriate one, if the House version
a

6

had been enacted, giving the complainant the right to sue,

7

but we believe the most crucial decision

8

history was when Congress decided to bringthe Secretary into

9

the picture under the Respondent’s reading of this# the only

in the legislative

10

possible effect of bringing the Secretary into the picture

11

is that he may decide not to sue about

12

complainant would have sued about»

13

something the

He cannot expand the scope of the lawsuit, it seems

14

to us that Congress brough

15

ture for exactly the opposite reason to expand the scope of

16

the inquiry beyond the limited self interest of the complainant

17

to look at the broader public purposes that are involved in

13

this statute»

19

the Secretary intc >fcha pic­

In order to assure free and democratic elections

20

for everyone, now even looked at narrowly it8s true that this

21

compiainant, as Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out, qualified

22

himself but tit was a close election for president and the

23

result might well have been different i£ someone else had

24

been able totrhn in additon it might have taken away more votes

25

from his opponent than from himself as happens in national

45

1

elections„

2

Q

Well the thing that puzzles me is here

3

is a man that's qualified under the rule that you're

4

It is difficult for me to understand why he'd be complaining

5

about a rule himself to the Secretary.

6

A

attacking.

Well, the District Court's reading of

7

his complaint on page 44 of the record said that this is what

8

h® complained about to the Secretary, we think that was an

9

accurate reading, but it may have been because he felt that

10

with more candidates in the field he would have done better,

11

there are people who are hoping that one of the governors will

12

run for President on a third party ticket this year because

13

they will benefit from it.
But self interest is not what Congress wanted to

14
15

promote under this statute, and indeed, in a very real sense,

16

since the Secretary's policy is to sue only if in his view the

17

member;s complaint to the union had validity. In a very real

18

sense what we are asking for here is to enable the Secretary

19

to consolidate the lawsuits that otherwise would have to be

20

separately brought, first to determine whether the leleecion

21

would be set aside and then to determine under what rules

22

the new election would be held which would, it seems to us,

23

untolerably delay the prompt remedy that Congress wanted to

24

provide.

Was any effort made to get Congress to

but Congress has not acted and there has not been an effort.
There have been attempts to clarify the issue,
in the Courts.
. Now I do want to point out before I sit down since

13

a reference has been made to the Secretary's interpretive

14

manual, which is on page 203 of the Appendis*, that it does

15

say that 12 of the attendance requirement 12 of 24 may be

16

reasonable. This is not a. regulation; it was not published

17

in ke Federal Register, .it was prepared for internal purposes

18

as a guide to field workers in the department and was made

19

public only by virtue of the Freedom of Information Act.

20

It was

not designed to be a definitive interpre­

21

tation of the statute, and certainly the Respondents have not

22

relxed on that provision becuase neither in that provision nor

23

in anything else has the SEcretaty ever said that

24

requirement may be reasonable.

25

a 3 year

And it's a 3 year requirement that's involved here,

47

1

2
3

"

and it is necessarily implicated in the case on the re-::un of
the election.
Even though the violation alleged was a violation

4

of —— application to 21 months, the 3 year requirement is

S

what is to be applied on the re-run.

6

I believe my time is expired.
