Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Courts
This case is here on certiori to the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and raises as its basic issue
the applicability of the finality rule of Cobbledick against
the United States to an order of the District Court which
denied a motion to quash a grand jury subpoena duces tecum and
at the same time modified the terms of 'the subpoena.
It is our submission that the Court below, in
holding the order appealable prior to any contempt conviction,
disregarded the central considerations of finality upon which
Cobbledick rests.
The relevant facts are these: on March 5, 1968
Respondent was served with a grand jury subpoena directing that
he produce before a grand jury sitting in the Central District
of California, those records in his possession, control or
custody, either personally or as a corporate director of five
enumerated Kenya corporations.
These were the Ryan Investments, Limited, the
2

1

Mawingo, Ltd* the Mount Kenya Safari Club, Ltd* Zimmerman,

2

Ltd* and Seven-Up Bottling Company.

3

dent moved to quash the subpoena, asserting among other things

4

that its terms were overly broad, that he did not have control

5

or possession of the records and that removal from Kenya as to

6

certain of the records,w ould violate Kenya law.

7

Later that month Respon­

On five dates thereafter, the first on April 9,

8

1968 and the last July 25, 1968, proceedings were held before

9

the! District Court concerning this motion to quash.

Arguments

'10

of counsel during thes© proceedings centeredprimarily on the

11

issue of control, the relationship between Internal Revenue

12

summonses and the grand jury's investigation and the restric­

13

ti ens of Kenya law regarding the removability from Kenya cer­

14

tain. of the records without the authorisation of Kenya authori­

15

ties .

16

In dealing with this latter restriction, the

17

latter consideration, namely the limitations of Kenya law as to

18

certain of the records, the Court, at July 12, the July 12 “68

19

hearing indicated that it was making a finding of control and

20

suggested that the parties enter a stipulation under which none

21

of the records would have to be removed from Kenya, but that

22

instead, agents

23

would fee permitted to inspect and copy ail the sought-after

24

records in Kenya.

25

the Government representing the grand jury

The Court made clear that if defense counsel agreed
3

to the
1

/arrangement he would be waiving only the authenticity of the

2

records and all other objections would be preserved.

3

Government agreed to this procedure and elected that the

4

parties try to work out some arrangements which were satisfac­

5

tory ones.

The

The Court further pointed out at this hearing that

6
7

if an agreement could be worked out presumably Mr. Ryan would

8

not have to appear before the grand jury at all in connection

9

with these documents.

10

Q

Were these domestic corporations or —

11

A

These were Kenya corporations.

12

Q

And what was Mr. Ryan's connection with

A

The Government's position was that Mr.

13
14

them?

15

Ryan was a director who owned 80 percent of "the Mawingo, . which

16

was doing business as Mount Kenya Safari Club, that he owned 98

17

percent of Ryan Investments, and that in fact, he was in con­

18

trol generally of ali these corporations.

19

Q

One of them was the Pepsi-Cola Company?

20

A

Well, that was in the original subpoena,

21

but the Court's order which modified the subpoena, excluded the

2,2

Pepsi-Cola and on

23

pany, from the reach of the subpoena on the grounds that the

24
25

of the other companies, the Zimmerman Com­

Pepsi-Cola Company apparently had gone out of business several
years before.

4

1

Q

That is the Pepsi-Cola Company of —

Of Kenya, not the Pepsi-Cola Company in

general.
On July 25 counsel reappeared before the Court

5

and respondent9s attorney said he could not agree to the pro­

6

posed stipulations since he did not believe his clients could

7

authenticate -the records sought.

8

the order which is here at issue and it's set forth, for the

9

Court's convenience, at 63 and 64 of the Appendix.

10

The Court thereupon entered

In this order the Court first made clear that it

11

found that respondent had control of the records of two or

12

perhaps three, as to the way one reads it, of the five companies

13

originally specified in the subpoena.

22

And Paragraph III dealt with these restricted

records in the foilwing way, and this is at page 64 of efehe

22

the order to show cause was transformed into an order to shew

24

This transformation occurred because the Grand Jury Selection

' G

Was an application made for a certificate?

13

1

2

h

Mo, there was no application made for a

certificate.

3

In Cobbledick the Court stated the basic rational©

4

which we think governs here and in Younger and Harris in a

5

somewhat different context the Court suggested the same type

6

of consideration.

7

Cobbledick --“"bearing the discomfiture and cost of a prosecu­

8

tion for crime# even by an innocent person is one of the pain­

9

ful obligations of citizenship.

That is# bearing - and I'm quoting from

The correctness of the trial

10

scurfs rejection even of a constitutional claim made by the

II

accused in the process of prosecution must await his convic­

12

tion before its reconsideration by an Appellate Tribunal."

13

This doctrine was particularly applicable# the

14

Court was of the view# and the grand jury situation, because

15

of it's essential and primary function in the enforcement of

16

criminal law# as this Court has recognized repeatedly? ifs

17

life is short ( 18 months generally)# governed by statute and

18

inteiruptions of its work had to be avoided.
.

19

Cobbledick concludeds "Interruption of its pro­

20

ceeding's by an appeal by a balking witness was permissible only

21

after the witness had been held in contempt.

22

even though the grand jury's process would be interrupted#

23

such interruption was justified# otherwise the witness would

24

have no alternative but to abandon this claim or languish in

25

jail."

14

At that point#

1

Obviously weighing the considerations of finality

2

against immediate interlocutory review

3

Cohbledick took account of the deterrent nature of the con-

4

tempt power? that -the exercise of that power would have real

5

potential in co-spelling an otherwise recalcitrant witness to

6

produe® or testify as ordered.

7

this Court in

This coercive potential, I submit, was deemed

8

proper and was the balance struck in Cobbledick because of the

S

overwhelming importance ofthe grand jury function and the need

10

to prevent this interruption by the frivolous claim.

It could

11

only be interruptedf the Court found, by those witnesses whose

12

refusal to comply was ©f such paramount significance to them

13

that they would refuse even though faced with a contempt cita­

14

tion, contempt conviction.
Only at that point did the scales tip in favor of

15
16

appealability and 'permit interruption of the grand jury8s

17

investigation.
Subsequent decisions of this Court have strengthen !5d

18
19

Cobbledick.

20

where this Court held appeals aren't available to chsllQ-hf©

21

orders denying motions to suppress evidence where criminal

22

proceedings were in train(ph) at the time of the ruling.

23

I refer to Di Bella against the United States,

In the course of Di Bella the Court significantly

24

pointed out that every statutory exception to finality is

25

addressed either in terns or by necessary operation to civil
15

1

actions, or by necessary operation to civil action„

2

bee thus no retreat from the Cobbledick rule that the cost and

3

discomfiture of a trial, even as to a constitutional claim,

4

must be gone through before a witness challenging a grand jury

5

subpoena may bring that matter to an appellate court.

6

There has

There is no sound reason, we submit, why -these

7

principles should not govern this case.

'that the question regarding control and other issues involved

9

in the July 25 order would be fully reviewable on appeal if

10
11
12

We point out again

Respondent is held in contempt.
Q

What do you say about the Court ©f

Appeals4 reasoning as to why Cobbledick didn't apply?

13

A

I find it somewhat mystifying.

14

Q

Could you state it and your answer

to it?

15

A

Well, the Court of Appeals stated,

and

16

this is set out — the precise language is sat out at 72 of the

17

record, and ha said; "None of the cases cited had the District

18

Court ordered anything other than compliance with the subpoena.

19

In contrast, the District Court here modified the subpoena with

20

respect to certain documents and directed the appellant to

21

undertake steps in a foreign country to have those documents

22

released by other persons for transportation to this country

23

or for inspection in Kenya by United States Agents.

24

IN directing that affirmative action be taken in

25

another country the District Court did more than deny a motion
16

1

to quash; it in affect, granted a mandatory injunction which,

2

given full effect; would require action by officials ©£ the

3

Kenya Government.

4

My answer is that I don’t know what that has to

5

d© with the question of appealability.

The Court simply, it

6

seems to me, by calling an order of a court which has complete

7

control over the grand jury process ~ the grand jury has no

8

authority to subpoena documents without the authority of the

9

court and the 'court has full authority to modify and change.

10

If a court is limited by the notion that any modification which

11

might have some affirmative effect would result in appeal-

12

ability; we think that the courts would be hesitant to do what

13

they should dos modify change subpoenas to grand juries.

14

I see nothing in the fact that it, in the

15

reasoning of the Court of Appeals, nor in the cases which it

16

cites, which takes this out of the Cobbledick rule.

17

takes it out of the CobfoXedick rule then I don’t know why a

18

subpoena directing production of documents, for example, which

19

are located in Mew York City, which is sought by a grand jury

20

sitting in the Centred District of California are similarly not

21

outside the Cobbledickrule.

22

If this

The problem here, it seems to me, is that there is

23

no sound basis for continued adherence to Cobblediek if one

24

can simply, by talking about affirmative directions of an order,

25

transform that iat© a 1292(a) Cl) injunction.
17

The history of

I

1292(&)Cl) -- neither the history of 1292(a)(1) nor its

2

application by this Court in the Bowden (?) ease* Switzerland

3

Cheese Association case* has indicated that even a civil

4

actions the court has been not prone t© apply that provision

except where there is truly an injunction.

8

to talk about this being an injunction in terms of a grand jury

proceeding* would hamper and make it quite easy to avoid a

grand jury investigation.

IO

Q

And here* 1 think

Did the July 25feh order have any

independent source except the subpoena?

11

A

As far as I know the July 25th order

12

was based upon the subpoena because in Part I it denied th®

13

motion to quash the subpoena.

14

Q

What I°m getting at 2 supposing the con­

15

tempt proceeding was brought against this man for failure to

16

obey the subpoena* which th© July 25th order sustain a separate

17

contempt proceeding?
A

18

No. The order of July 25th, what that did

19

was it took the subpoena and in ©ur view eased the burdens of

20

compliance.

21

of a document retaining the grand jury function that it was to

22

perform* but there are no two independent documents now out­

23

standing.

24

for contempt with regard t© the subpoena and then a contempt

23

with regard to the order. - There would be one of contempt ~

Ittransformed the subpoena into a different kind

In answer to your questions there will be no basis

18

1

Q

Well, it did ordar him to take certain

2

affirmative action in Kenya.

3

A

The order did? yes.

It told him to apply

4

fe© fell® Registrar of Companies to produce, to permit removal

5

from Kenya of certain documents.

6

he was to permit agents, and we believe agents of the grand

7

jury, and argument wasraade here that these records would have

8

been available to the civil tax —
Q

9

If that request were denied

I suppose what you say is that, although

10

the — that was a form of mandatory injunction it was really

11

in essence, an interpretation of what this man. had to do in

12

order to comply with the subpoena.
A

13

Precisely.

As I say, my point was that

14

the subpoena issues through the authority of the court and the

15

order of the court modifying the subpoena requiring the affir­

1S

mative action was merely a clarification which mad® precis® and

17

particularised the duties that the Respondent was required t©

18

perform.
And it is our view that if that is a mandatory

19
20

injunction

21

poena can be classified the same way and the policy decisions

22

of Cobbledick and Di Bella
Q

23
24

that any kind of modification by a judge of a sub­

can be very easily avoided.

What was the form of

the proceeding that

triggered the July 25th order?

25

A

It was a motion to quash the subpoena duces i

tecum

z
3

Q

Mot a motion of the Government for

supplemental relief?
A

4

Oh * no.

The situation was this: the

5

subpoena was served, as 1 said, on March 5, f68j a motion to

6

quash alleging a variety of grounds was mads toward the and

7

of March, and thereafter the five proceedings which led up to

8

tine July 25 order were wholly in connection with the motion to

S

quash the subpoena.
Q

10

I suppose a subpoena itself could be

11

considered an injunction under the reasoning of the Court of

12

Appeals.

13

A

Well, we —

14

Q

Let alone a modification.

15

A

I assume so, because any subpoena requires

16

scan€i affirmative action implicit in it.

T© produce records

17

one must, if he has them in his warehouse he must go to the

16

warehouse and get them.

19

Appeals, it seems to me, has opened the door for an easy way

20

to avoid the very significant requirements of Cobbledick which

21

this Court has reaffirmed and developed and it is our view that

22.

1292(a)(1) does not provida the remedy nor the cost of delay

So that I think that the Court of

24

nothing more than the Court exercising the authority, historic

authority to promote the functioning of the grand jury.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY HERBER J. MILLER, JR., ESQ.

10

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. MILLERs

11
12
13

Very well, Mr. Feit.

Mr, Chief Justice and may it please

the Courts
The subpoena that was served on Raymond Ryan on

14

March 5, 1968 required the production of records, corporate

15

records covering a period of 30 years? required the production

IS

of these records, even though they were Kenya corporations, and

17

all of the records subpoenaed, were in fact, located in Kenya.

18

Upon receiving the subpoena, Ryan, as this

Court

19

has suggested in McPhaul and Bryan, out of respect for the

20

tribunal seeking the records, filed a motion to quash, based

21

on several grounds, including oppressiveness, a violation of

22

the law of Kenya.

23

I submit that Petitioners in later proceedings, if

24

this is not considered an appealable order, would be well-

25

advised when being served with a grand jury subpoena not to
21

i

1

file a motion to quash and not to obtain an interlocutory

2

ruling as to whether or not 'there should be compliance „

3

reason is very simple; that had this subpoena merely been

4

ignored there was no question in anyoneSs mind who has looked

5

at it that this subpoena would in fact# have been void and

6

invalid; if not for being oppressive and requiring the trans­

quiring Respondent Ryan to travel to Kenya and produce 2#000

18

pounds of records at his own expense# covering a 30-year,

period# was an appealable order.

It is because it is in the nature of an

requirements there are that —- the way the order Is enforced is

20

that the pleadings of the party be stricken or that some other

Yes, sir, and I would submit that if that

A

The order could b® s© phrased whereby it

could be contempt.

14

A

If it war© and if it were mandatory — if

15

the Court specifically said, as in this case, that: ''You shall

16

forthwith take yourself to a doctor's office," and the like,

17

then under those circumstances comparable to the order issued

18

here I think you would have a question of an appealability.

And the reason is, if the Court pleas®:

20

has established the appellate jurisdiction, has said that

21

certain interlocutory decisions are appealable.

22

That's 1292.

12

A

13

Q

Correct,
Well, what's the difference between the

14

subpoena and an order — an ordinary subpoena and what

15

happened in this case in terms of whether it commands certain

affirmative acts or not?

17

A

20

to turn records over for copying by any agent of -the Department

of Justice or the Treasury Department.

22

Q

There was no requirement in that subpoena

Well; in the case of civil litigation if

23

the Government had applied to inspect and copy records in

24

Kenya and the Court had ordered Mr. Ryan to turn them over for

25

inspection and copying it would not have been an appealable

of order and depending on the framework — for example: if it

5

apply for a- letters rogatory«Then I concede that there would,

32

1

Q

Well, I fail to follow you on why then it

2

would be such an imposition on him to produce records which

3

may have some consequence in this investigation*

4

A

The imposition, sir, is that he is

5

required "forthwith," to make application and to do the things

Chief Justice’s inquirys isn’t this order of which you com­

13

plain nothing more than an implementation to the original

14

subpoena.
A

15

I believe it goes fax beyond the original

16

subpoena, because it does what the subpoena could not dos it

17

requires these records be made available to any agent of the

18

Department of Justice or of the Internal Revenue Service, with­

19

But, would that kind of a refusal t©

3

quash that kind of a subpoena which would demand inspection

4

and copying ©r permit inspection and copying, would that be

5

refused?

6

A

No, sir; I don't believe it would because

7

it is, unlike the case hare where the grand jury subpoena,

8

subject to the strictures ©f 6(e) has bean totally violated by

9

the order of July 25., which requires the records be made

10

available to either the Treasury or Department of Justice

11

agents; no limitation; no requirement that the records be

12

produced for the grand jury at a date certain.

13

that these records be kept in camera and subject to the rules

14

of 6(e) as required by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

15
16

17

No requirements

Thus, this order goes far beyond what is compel**
lable by a grand jury subpoena.
Q

Well, I suppose the defendant in an ordinary

18

criminal case voulct make the Government produce for inspection

19

and c opying certain documents?

/

20

A

Correct.

21

Q

Under 16?

22

A

Yes.

23

Q

And the Court will issue an order directing

24

the Government at a specific time and place to produce,

25

for inspection and copying certain documents?

Yes# sir.

23

I say that this order went far beyond the subpoena

24

because the subpoena did not, even by implication require an

25

application b® mad® to a foreign official of Kenya.

37

Now, if,

Now, granted the subpoena would require the

10

latter part, but I submit to the Court that even though the

11

subpoena — this subpoena goes far beyond any that I have ever

seen in my experience, and I wager, as I said before, we tried

13

challenged the Government to show us a comparable expression

14

of requirement of any subpoena or court order to produce docu­

13

ments and they came up with exactly no cases, as I knew they

16

would.

Wiare in other cases is has been indicated that a

And the Court ruled to the contrary.

Mr. Miller, if, hypothetically, Mr. Ryan

I couldn’t agree with the Court, more and I

my evidence I had to get in affidavit form because ©11 of the

witnesses were, in fact, in Kenya.

and the Government filed other affidavits and the Court read

the affidavits and said: "I find that at times before and

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY JEROME FEIT, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
42

MR. FESTs

I

I6d Ilk© to make two points.

First,

2

inviting the original record, which is here, I will refer the

3

Court fc® pages 112, in which the Assistant United States

4

Attorney snakes it quite plain that these records would only be

5

used ■ for the grand jury purpose! that is those who inspect

6

the records in Kenya.
Again, on pages 90 and 91 where the District Court

7

8

further makes it plain that these records and that the agents

9

who

10

were to examine them were agents, in fact, of the grand

jury and there would be no violation of Rule 16.
It seems to me that the thrust of the argument

11
12

here, essentially is that Cobbledick rules should not be

13

followed.

14

issue would be resolved or would be litigated on appeal on the

15

validity of the July 25 order.

16

As we have indicated, there is no question that this

The question as to whether ©r not it can be

17

reviewed at the contempt proceeding it seems to us that it's

19

control was litigated.

20

seems to us,if Respondent has additional evidence which would

22

the motion to suppress, the Court could change its mind.
