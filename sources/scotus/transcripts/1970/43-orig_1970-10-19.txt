ORAL ARGUMENT BY LEE JOHNSON ON BEHALF
OF THE STATE OF OREGON

7

MR. JOHNSON;

8
9
10

I?
12

13

original action under Article III/ Section 2 of the Constitution^
and 28 U.S.C. Section .1251 in which the State of Oregon is the
plaintiff and the defendant is the Attorney General of the
United States, John Mitchell, which is not a resident of the
State of Oregon,
We are seeking a decree that Title III of the Voting

14

15
16
17

Rights Act of 1970 is unconstitutional in enjoining the defendanfc from enforcing this title with respect to the plaintiff
s tate.
The guts of that statute is simply in Section 302

18
19

20

which prohibits states

.from denying the franchise to any person

over the age of 18 who is otherwise qualified to vote.

2!
22

Q

Residence, is that involved

A

We are not challenging them, Mr, Justice.

The Oregon Constitution, like that of 36 other

23
24

May it please "the Court: this is an

states, restricts the franchise to those who are 21 years and
older.

And I might add that in May of 1970 the voters of Qregor

25

3

?

overwhelmingly defeated a constitutional amendment which would

2

have reduced the voting age to 19 .

3

There are some points in the plaintiff's argument

4

over which I think there is little dispute and which I would

5

like to dispose of at the outset.
First, the states have traditionally determined

6
7

voter qualifications and that tradition was contemplated by the

3

drafters of the constitution in Article I, Section 2 dealing

9

with the election of representatives and Article II, Section 1

'30

dealing with the selection of presidential electors and was re­
affirmed even after the passage of the 14th Amendment, was

12

reaffirmed in the 17th Amendment which deals with the election

13

of Senators.

S4

Secondly, states certainly have a vital and

15

legitimate interest in restricting the franchise) to responsible

16

persons and age is certainly a relevant criterion in determining

17

the qualifications for voter responsibility.

13

Thirdly, the implementation of an age classifica­

19

tion . inevitably leads to line-drawing and reasonable men can

20

certainly differs as to the precise location of that line.

21

I tliink also there are obviously outer limits

22

over which reasonable men would also not differ that the line

23

was not reasonable.

24
25

Fourthly, while legislative wisdom may prefer one
line over another, no one can seriously argue that a minimum
4

1

of 18 or 19 or 20 or 21 is irrational, irrelevant or invidious.

2

I think this Court could perceive a reasonable basis for any

3

one of these choices./

4

1 think the point was put very succinctly by

5

Professor Herbert Weschier in a letter to the President which

€

appears in the Congressional Record on this legislationP in

7

which he states, and I quote:
"Age is obviously not irrelevant to qualifications

8
9

and since any age criterion involves the drawing of an

10

arbitrary line, fixing the age at 21 most certainly is not

11

capricious."

12

I think that there will be considerable dispute

13

over many issues that will follow in my argument and that the

14

Solicitor General will raise, but I think really the issue in

15

this case boils down to one point, and it is simply this: it is

16

whethe.r Congress has the power to substitute its legislative

17

preference in selecting that line for the preference of the

18

voters of the State of Oregon.

19

Of course for Congress to exercise such a legis­

20

lative mandate it must look to one of the enumerated powers

21

afendant concedes that the responsibility for determining

22
23
24
25

I
voter qualifications is at least primarily vested in the states [
Iej
by the Constitution.
The defendant rests its case on Section 5 of the
14th Amendment.

5

1

I think in order to understand Section 5 we must

2

first examine Section 1 of that amendment and X think the point

3

should be made that Section 1, standing alone, is not an

4

affirmative grant of power to Congress, but rather is merely a

5
8
7
8
9
10
11
12

13
14

prohibition against the states*

And this is in contrast to the

enumerated powers of Congress, such as interstate commerce that
arc enumerated in Article I, Section 4 of the constitution.
Section 5 in the 14th Amendment gives Congress the
power to do all that is necessary and proper to enforce the
prohibition of Section 1, but the test necessarily must be
whether -the power -exercised by Congress is appropriate to the
enforcement or whether it is prohibited by Section h
In Title 3 Congress and the defendant have
attempted to obviate this test by bootstrap reasoning.

First,

in Section 201 of the Act, Congress declares that requiring a
15
16

17

citizen to be 21 years of age in order to vote is a violation
of the eqaal protection prohibition and therefore it is necessaz
and proper to enforce the prohibition by preventing the states

18
19

20

from denying the franchise to anyone who is over 18.
Secondly, defendant now asserts the judicial of
Congress3s findings is confined to the single issue of whether

21
the court can perceive any rational basis therefor.
22
We concede that the perceived basis test is the
23
appropriate test of legislation under the necessary and proper
24
embodied in Section 5.
25

6

We also concede that it’s a proper role for

1
2

Congress toseek and identify violations of equal protection

3

prohibition? but there is still one defective link in defendant5

4

chain of reasoning that destroys the connection»
We submit that first that the perceived basis

5
S

test is not the appropriate test of judicial review in deter­

7

mining the scope and the meaning of the equal protection pro­

8

hibition,

9

Court? exercising its independent judgment and review»

10

This is a determination that must be made by this

Secondly? even if the perceived basis test is

11

applicable there is no ground in this case

12

basis that Title III is aimed at a 14th Amendment objective»

13

for perceiving a

17

18
19

20
21

22
23

24
25

I am sure the Court is familiar with

who had attended six years in an American school.
The difficult problem in ‘the case was that

’.eraey

tests on their face certainly are not invidious or irrational,
Nevertheless, the Court? and we believe correctly, upheld the
act because it? and I quote: "may be readily seen as plainly
adapted to further the aims of equal protection,!!
The Court in its majority opinion followed two
rationales in reaching this conclusion: first? that the enhanced
7

1

political power would or may be helpful in gaining an undis-

2

criminatory governmental services for Puerto Ricans.

3

that reason the Court could perceive a basis that the legisla-

4

tion was necessary and proper to insure equal protection of the

S

laws for this particular ethnic minority group.

And for

Secondly<■ the Court could perceive a basis for

6
7

Congress ascertaining that the New York literacy test was being

8

used as a direct device to deny the franchise to Puerto Ricans

9

solely because of their national origin.
Under both rationales the Court, and again we

believe rightly, confined Congress9s powers to determine what is
necessary

and proper in the broadest terms and confined its

review to whether it perceived a basis for Congressional deter­
mination .
But, contrary to the defendant8s argument, the
Court merely confirmed what was obvious in that case, that the
object of the legislation was plainly adopted for furthering the
aims of the 14th Amendment.
As the Court itself recognized, the sole practical
effect of that act in Katzenbach versus Morgan was to extend the
franchise to large segments of a minority group which had here­
tofore been denied the right largely as a result of their
national origin.

And of course, the action denying rights to

minorities because of their race, color, national origin are
classic 14th Amendment objectives.

25

8

But ip contrary to defendant's argument, there is no

1
2

suggestion in Kafcsenbach versus Morgan that the

3

that Congress had not only broad powers to fashion remedies, but

4

that Congress could, indeed, determine what is prohibited by

ourt was saying

In other words, what is prohibited by the equal
protection clause and -elicit that determination by Congress would
be. binding upon this Court,
Defendant's interpretation can only be supported
by taking isolated sentences from the opinion and reading those
sentences totally out of context.

Furthermore, there is no

support in the precedents for defendant's interpretation.
Defendant cites cases involving interstate commerce,
but the issue in those cases was not what is interstate com­
merce but rather what is Congress's power under the necessary
end proper clause.

Inall of those cases the Court still rev

reserved to itself the ultimate determination of the issue of
what is interstate commerce.
I'd like to suggest that if you follow defendant's
rationale would mean, that there would be hardly an area of
state legislation, of state law that Congress could not pre­

21
22

empt, because as this Court has many times recognised, legis­
latures must make choices and necessarily must make classifica­

23
tions or if you like, we can call them “discriminations."

But

2.4
these classifications are inherent in the legislative process.
23

9

?

Section i of the 14th Amendment doss not prohibit

2

all classifications and it never has? but only those which are

3

irrelevant, invidious or irrational»

4

leave to Congress the prerogative to determine which classifica­

5

tions coma with equal protection, then Congress could declare

6

almost all state legislation -- declare the classifications

7

therein as a violation of equal protection and thus deem within

8

their scope so that they could, preempt states and render the

9

state legislatures virtually ■unnecessary»
But as a practical matter, the attraction of•

10
11

12

13
14

15
16
17

state power or state jurisdiction in the defendant5s rationale
may not be as significant as the effect that that rationale
would have upon the jurisdiction of this Court.

20

21
22
23

determine what is violative of the 14th Amendment, then by
equal logic Congress should be able to determine what is not
violative of the amendment.
I think the Court in its opinion in Katzenbaeh
versus Morgan clearly indicates that it was not buying "the'
defendant’s argument because in footnote 10 the Court indicates
that now it is reserving to itself the — to its independent
judgment what is violative and what is not violative of the
14th Amendment.

1

My only response to that, Mr. Justice,

£

v/ould be that 1 can't see how you can reserve it. one way and

3

not go both ways, and I think that is —

4

Q

That's what footnote 10 said; wasn't it?

5

A

The question iss whether, I think really

6

the question is whether the majority opinion goes as far as the

7

government says it does and I think one of the indications that

8

it does not is that footnote.
Q

9
10
11

because I was on the other side of it,but after all, there it
is.

12

20
21

22
23

Well, I ha not defending the footnote

Q

May I ask you one question?

A

Yes.

Q

Would your positioxi be different if all

the Federal Acts provided was that voters voting for state
offices, like Governors and so forth, or if it provided that
it affected only voters voting for President or Members of
Congress?
A

I think that the legislation would be on a

stronger basis if it was limited to only Federal offices because
then possibly the government could rely on its general preserva­
tion of the Federal election process as the grounds, and not the
14th Amendment, to uphold the statute.
So, for that reason I would say it would be a

24
different ballgame.
25

But, in this case they have rested it solely
11

1

upon the 14th Amendment.
Q

2

You mean to apply to all voters for state

and Federal offices?

A

5
6

7

Are the provisions severable?

'&

4

I think it is possible to make them

severable„ although the act does not contain a severability
clause and I think if we do make them severable the Court should

8

maybe consider the very definite administrative difficulty that

9

this would probably create and maybe it would be better to refer

10

it back to Congress because if the states are put in the position

11
12

13

that they have to grant the franchise to 18“year~olds in Federal
elections but not in state elections this creates a tremendous
administrative burden.
So, it seems to me there would be a real question

14
15
16
17

'18

19
2©
21

22

as to whether Congress actually intended that the statute be
severable,
The second point I would like to make is that if
Congress is to be the interpreter of the 14th Amendment then it
likewise would have to be the interpreter of other sections of
the constitution.

For example: Congress could not only deter-

mine what was necessary and proper, but it could determine what,
in fact, is interstate commerce.

Congress could reserve for

itself to determine what, in fact, is a constitutional tax.
23
24

X point you to Article X, Section 8 of the
constitution, which says : "Congress shall have the power to

25
12

1

make all the lav/s which shall be necessary and proper and all

2

other powers vested by this constitution in the government of

3

the United States or in any department or officer thereof.Ti

4

Under defendant's rationale Congress could deter­

5

mine itself the limits of the power conferred upon itself, the

6

limits of the power conferred upon the President, the limits

7

of the power conferred upon this Court and the limits of the

S

powers of the Federal Government as against the States, subject

3

only to the test of whether this Court could perceive a basis.
It seems to me if we follow the defendant’s rationale we are

10

doing nothing less than repudiating the doctrine of judicial

11

review .

12

8

We submit that Katzenbach versus Morgan does not

13

go that far; it merely holds that Congress had. broad powers to

14

fashion remedies to enforce the prohibitions of the 14th Amend­

IS

ment .

16

In the instant case there is no equal protection

objective that can be identified.

20
21

22
23

24
25

i effect, the sole practical effect of Title III would be to en­
franchise any person who is between the ages of 18 and 21.

Now,

there is no suggestion in the Congressional debate and indeed,
there could be none that this will enfraneise a group which had
heretofore been discriminated against because of their race,
their color, their national origin or economic status, or on
13

1

any other basis that could be classified as invidious, irre­

2

levant or irrational»
Now, to some, including myself personally, it would

3
4

be desirable to extend the franchise, but legislative desir­

5

ability is not the test.

6

decide and cannot cede to Congress to decide is whether restric­

7

ting the franchise to those who are 21 is so inherently un­

8

reasonable as to be irrational or irrelevant.

The issue which this Court must

We submit that 21 years of age ™ the 21-years-of

9
10

age standard employed by Oregon and 36 other states, indeed,

11

which is infirm in Section 2 of the 14th Amendment, which deals

12

with reapportionment, the only place in the United States Con­

13

stitution where the 21-year-old standard is mentioned.

14

is certainly an affirmance of what has gone on for many years?

15

that the 21-year-age standard is a reasonable classification

18

eve^ ’f it might not be a desirable classification, it is a

17

reasonable classification that falls much far short of the pro­

18

hibitions of the 14th Amendment.
We feel that the government advances the argument

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

But this

that there must be a compelling state interest and advances many
arguments which are legislative reasons, not constitutional
reasons, but legislative reasons for extending the franchise to
18-year-olds.

And the suggestion is made by the government that

great deference should be given to Congress because they are
better at this line-drawing exercise than the Court is.
14

Well,

1

we suggest 'that once you accept the proposition that a line

2

has to be drawn and. that there is an area in here in which

3

reasonable men can differ as to where that line should be drawn,

4

that the decision there is not to be made by Congress because

5

the constitution contemplates that that decisiori as to voter

6

qualifications is to be made by the states.
And still the only question is whether the classi­

7

3
9

fication that is made by the states meets the 14th Amendment
standards of being invidious, irrational or irrelevant.
For these reasons we :pray that the Court will grant

10

11

tha relief the plaintiff prays for.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

ORAL ARGUMENT BY PROFESSOR CEARLES ALAN WRIGHT

U

ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF TEXAS

15

MR. WRIGHT;

16

17

Thank you, Mr. Johnson.

the Court;

Mr, Chief Justice and may it please

although the position of Texas is exactly the same

as that of Oregon, I want to take, insofar as possible, to avoid
18

19
20

duplicating the able arguments which Attorney General Johnson
has made on behalf of Oregon ’with regard to Title III.
Last week, reading one of

21

22

the amicus briefs, to one

of the most

respected lav; firms in theUnited States, has lent

its name, I

came across an argument in support of this statute

that seemed

to me quite interesting.

23
It was said that even hers

2.4

it was not a denial of equal protection to deny the vote to
25
15

i

those between 1.8 and 21, that many in that age group think' that

2

it is, that this causes a sense of alienation and the Congress

3

has power under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment to cure this

4

feeling of alienation even if it is the product of only an

5

apparent and not a real denial of equal protection.

6

That argument, it seems to me, to highlight the

7

unreality of this entire litigation.

3

respect that is always due to the body that sits across the

3

street I suggest that the proper response of this Court would

10

have been to dismiss out of hand the attempts to support this

It

legislation, on the grounds that the legislation is frivolous.

12

13
14

Were it not for the

Prior to 1965 I cannot suppose that anyone could
imagine that the Congress of the United States has the power to
sabb&iihfefeeiissppm§ferenee

for that of the states with regard-

15

to the age of voters.

18

Kafcsenbach v. Morgan it is still necessary intha phrase of John

17

Marshall picked up there that the "Acts of Congress be con-

18

sistent with the letter and spirit of the constitution," and I

19

submit that this legislation is not? that this legislation flies

29

in the face of the letter of the constitution? that it does

21

violence to a constitutional tradition that has gone on as long

22

as the country has existed.

23
24
25

Even under the broadest reading of

There are many provisions in the Constitution of
the United States that are not hastily read and about which
reasonable men can readily differ but I should have thought that
i
16
1

1

j the numerical provisions in the constitution, above all, are

2

provisions that have one meaning, a meaning that does not change:

3

with the passage of time.» but when the people of the United

4

States and the 14th Amendment refer twice to 21 years of age

S

as being an appropriate age for people to vote, that they meant

S

21 years of age? that they did not mean at 18 or some other

7

number, no

8

may be to what 21 was a century ago,

matter how functionally similar that number today

9

It is, I suppose, always a temptation of counsel

10

to overstate the importance of this case and I do not wish to

11

sound like George Wharton Pepper arguing Carter v. Carter Cole

12

or like the distinguished advocate- who argued the first in­

come tax case, but I submit, as■seriously as I can, that these
issues in this ease have nothing to do with whether 18-year-olds
vote or not; that8s an ideal that plainly is going to come,
whatever the decision of this Court in this case; the issue in
this case is more fundamental from that.

It is whether the

historic concept of this country, a country of Federal union in
which the central government and the states share powers and
responsibilities allocated by written constitution, whether that
concept is a failure? whether we now must take constitutional
shortcuts in order to impose on the states a reform that to a
majority of Congress seems desirable but that 46 states have not
yet seen fit to embrace.
The most rigorous test for state voting
17

1

the Equal Protection Clause is that the states must be able to

z

show a compelling state interest to justify the exclusion of

3

the group from the electorate.

4

it seams in my submission, that Texas and 35 other states come

5

through with flying colors.

Even measured against that test

The distinguished Solicitor General agrees, as 1

becomes how you go about implementing this compelling state
interest, how you identify those persons who would qualify co

V'

Solicitor General does not disagree with our position, that

age is an appropriate means for mailing this determination.
one supposes that age is an infallible,

There is in the courtroom today a 17-year-old

The

citisen of my state who is better-informed, more responsible,
more mature than most 18, 21, 43-year olds that I know, but
neither Congress nor the State of Texas are going to allow him
to vote because neither one of us have any calipers by which we
can say, "Yes, this 17-year-old is ready to vote? this 17-yearold is not."

And so the invariable practice of the American

States, a practice that Congress does not undertake to supercede
8

t

in this legislation, is that we are going to elect an age and

2

we are going to indulge a presumption that when a person reaches

3

a certain age at that point he possesses in sufficient quantity

4

these qualities of education, responsibility, maturity, that

5

will let him become a part of the political process.

We have said that we would rather wait until

the person is 21, because when he reaches that age we can be
reasonably confident that he has the needed qualities.
For Congress tosay that we are denying to our
citizens the equal protection of the laws by doing this, for
j Congress to say that somehow this determination on the parfcof
Texas is irrational or invidious or unnecessary for state purposes is 3imply to substitute Congress's determination of ‘tills
factual question for the determination that the people of Texas
have made for themselves, a determination that we think we were
amply justified in making for ourselves in light of the specific
twice-repeated language of Section 2 of the 14th Amendment.

Q

Professor Wright, what do you think of the

government’s suggestion that the history shows that there are
references to age 21 in Section 2 for a particular purpose? that
they were written in light of the effort to assure the franchise
to the emancipated slaves who otherwise met the then existent
voter qualifications?
A

Mr. Justice, 1 think that everyone who has

studied Section 2 of the 14th Amendment, knows that it was a
Federally-contrived compromise which was intended not only to
put a premium on the Negro voting in Idle South but not in the
North, but it intended also to make sure that aliens in New York
and women in Massachusetts were counted in apportionment of

23
24

Congress, while they were denied the vote at the time, but I
have not understood that there was any history indicating that

25
21

1

the choice of the age 21 in that provision was any part of this

2

elaborate political compromise and as I read history the age

3

21 is there because, not only the draftsmen of the 14th Amend­

4

ment, but the states that ratified it, regarded 21 as the proper

5

age at which one became a part of the electorate.
The Solicitor General suggested that perhaps the

6
7

references to 21 in Section 2 may be regarded as descriptive

a

rather than prescriptive.

difficult to follow.

The section says, and this is not merely

describing? it is prescribing — that if you start denying the
right to vote to persons who are over 21 years of age who other­
wise meet the test we say here, you are going to lose that pro­
portion of your Congressional delegation that the number your
©delude bears to the whole number of persons over 21 and that,
in my submission, is prescriptive language.

That it has never

been enforced does not mean that it could not be enforced or
that it was not intended to be enforce or that it should not be
read today as having little significanee.
It would be —

Q

20

It is a suggestion, that we find

Are you not suggesting that there isn't at

least some ambiguity about this?
-A

22

Yes, sir; that with regard to age 21 I am

saying that there is no ambiguity that he who runs may read

this.
24I would not suggest that the Constitution of the

Obviously the power of the central government under the

order to fcaster the economy to promote commerce among the
several states, but it would be quite another thing to give
Congress that same kind of a free hand in regulating the poll”
tical makeup of the states and partifucularly no relationto the
Federal Government.
But this is the one area that up until now has been
left to the states.

We have still been a body politic, a

constituant part of the Federal Union, free to govern ourselves
at least in terns of determining how we will govern ourselves,
though wei must of course yield to Federal legislation in the
regulatory sphere.
It is this that in the judgment of Texas is en­
dangered by the statute that is now in front of us.

The resort

to imaginary harbors is always a risky form of legal reasoning
and I prefer not to use it.

And yet, as we have suggested in ou

brief, if this act is constitutional it is hard to visualise
23

any other acts of Congress with regard to voting qualification
24

that cannot be justified as easily and there are a good many

thing that go beyond the area of voting qualifications that

2

Congress might decide were necessary in order to enforce the

grants of due process of law and of equal protection.

Xn Texas's view the reason nobody ever- suspected

until this past spring that this power is in Congress under the

(3

constitution just because the power under the constitution is

7

not in Congress; because the internal controls that the state

has with regard to its own government by the constitution is

9

specifically left to the states.

With regard to our.patti<

10

issue here, the choice of the age 21 is one that the Const!tv,.

'ii

tion of the United States specifically says Texas may males.
And it is for those reasons that Texas?, prays for

a judgment declaring Sitie III to be unconstitutional.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY HONORABLE ERWIN N. GRISWOLD,

ON BEHALF OF JOHN N. MITCHELL, ATTORNEY GENERAL

MR. GRISWOLD?

23

the Courts

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the cases now being, argued| numbers 43 and 44

original, Oregon and Texas against. John N. Mitchell, Attorney
General, are. being argued first, I suppose, because they have the
lower docket numbers.
They involve only the question of age under the
24

1

18-year-old vote provision in the Feting Rights Amendment Act

2

of 1970.

3

And I am representing the * -'..«ondent in those cases.
The two following cases are: The -United States

4

against Arizona and the United States against Idaho, numbers

5

46 and 47 original.

in addition to other provisions; one relating to literacy tests

They also involve the age provision but

and. the other relating to residency requirements.

In those

cases I am representing the Plaintiffs.
Since we were appearing for the plaintiffs today
our briefs had to be filed before our brief in this case was due
and the consequence is that our principal brief has been filed
in the Arizona and Idaho cases, numbers 46 and 47 original.
After the factual statement in that brief there is
a general discussion on pages 23 to 39,

Then it deals with the

literacy and residency matters and finally it deals' with voting
ags at pages 63 to 76.

The general portion of that brief, our

Arizona brief, and the final portion relating to age, are, in
effect, our opening brief in this case.
Then the briefs filed by Oregon and Texas are, in
effect, their answering briefs and the brief which we have filed
for the defendant in this case is, in effect, our reply brief
on the voting age.

I have taken this time to explain that situa­

tion because I think, it is a little confusing if one just picks
up the papers.
Now, the chronology and the sides of the parties in

25

the several cases and the varying issues made this# I think,

9

was in all four cases.

In the two following cases I

It does not relate at all to the

literacy or residency matters which are involved only in the

10

Arizona and Idaho cases, which will be heard after these cases

11

are concluded.

12

The Voting Rights Amendment Act of 1970 originated

13

in the House of Representatives simply as a proposal to extend

14

the Voting Rights Act of 1965 which, by its terms, expired in

15

1970, and to add a provision making it, in effect, no .longer as

16

invidious as it had been, by extending the abolition of literacy

17

requirements nationwide.

IS

In the House provisions with respect to residency

19

were added and before it was passed by the Rouse it went to the

20

Senate.

21

In the Senate amendments were proposed to provide for

18 year olds voting? there was extensive consideration and

22

debate in the Senate as to whether this should be done by Act

23

of Congress, or whether it could be done by Act of Congress or

24

whether it should be done by a Constitutional Amendment.
26

23
l

When it was pending before the Senate, officers of

t

2

the Department of.Justice appeared before the Congressional

**"'

Committees.

4

respect to this bill and one, the House hearings, deals only

5

with the literacy and residency and then there are two volumes

6

of Senate hearings before different subcommittees in the summer

7

of 1969 and in February of 1970, where these matters were ex­

OfS

tensively considered.
Deputy Attorney General Kleindienst appeared before

9
10

11
12

13

one of the.Senate Committees"and presented the view of the
President that the change should be made but that it should be
done by constitutional amendment.

16

17

And on March 10, 1970 Assistant Attorney General
Relinquist presented to the same committee a substantial state­
ment against the constitutional validity of making the change by
statute„
Now, this appears beginning at page 23 of the

18
19

20

hearings and the Court will, of course, want to give considera­
tion to these views.
Finally, when the legislation had been passed by

22

24

And this appears at pages

78 to 80 of the Senate Committee Hearings for February 17, 1970.

14

IS

I may say there are three volumes of hearings with

Congress as a statutory provision and not a constitutional
amendment, and the President signed it on June 22, 1970, the
President made a statement, of which I shall read the first two
paragraphs.

This is the President’s statement:

Before you launch on that, Mr. Solicitor

This can be be shown, I think, by taking up these

cases one by one and using them as building blocks to the

ultimate conclusion.

but the first in the cases I wish to mention now is Lassiter

14

against Northampton County Board of Elections in 360 U.S.

There are roots in the past, of course,

That case upheld, inthe absence of any Act of

do not contravene any restriction that Congress, acting pur­

Now, that is simply Section. 1, the basic Equal

17

the important thing to note is that the result was reached under

18

the Equal Protection Clause alone. There was not a trace of

19

racial discrimination in the Carrington case; there was none

Act of 1565.

That case involved the Voting Rights

The statute drew support from the 14th and the

15th Amendments and what was important about the case was the
scope it gave to the enforcement clauses of those amendments.
Section 2 of the 13th and Section 2 of the 15th
Amendment and these are identical with the power to enforce
given to Congress by Section 5 of the 14th Amendment.

25

33

And, under 'those provisions the Court held that

z

what Congress had provided in the Noting Rights Act of 1965 the

3

abolition of literacy test was a constitutional provision and

I point out that

this is almost immediately following this

The significant difference between the situation
here and in the Lassiter case is simply that Congress has under­
taken to exercise its power under the reinforcement clauses.
It5s quite clear as I have indicated that it it not merely the
enforcement clause of the 14th Amendment but also of the 15th
and residually, I think, of the 13th.

But here is a situation

where Congress, acting under its power to enforce provisions of
■the constitution made invalid state statutory provisions which

15

had only recently been held to be constitutional under the pro­
visions of the 14th and 15th Amendments themselves.

Perhaps it was a sleeping giant, but there it is

As a matter of

The 18th Amendment had a similar enforcement clause,

Evard Breweries case the Court upheld the constitutional vali­

it was comparable to the powers given the Congress by the

shall I say, encouraged by the famous language of Chief Justice

that.

21

And in the James

Similarly, Congress has no explicit power under the

22

constitution to regulate due process, but the Shreveport case

23

found that power in the necessary and proper clause when it was

24

necessary to make Congress's power over interstate commerce

25

effective and more recently the instance of the same exercise of
38

1

power is found in United States against Darby and in many

2

decisions under the Fair Labor Standards Act and the National

South Carolina against Katzenbach there is the case of

power of Congress to provide equal accommodations in local

One other ease here to which I would like to make

This decision,

along with Carrington and Rash are enough, it seems to me,, to
answer*, the suggestion that Article I, Section 2. of the constitu­
tion provides the states with exclusive power in this area.
Q

Am 1 wrong in thinking that Katzenbach

against South Carolina was decided under th® 15th Amendment?
Av

Yes, Mr. Justice.

It was decided, 1 think

it can be said under the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments, but
certainly under the 15th Amendment.
Now t!i®re are two more recent cases: Kramer against

If they wanted a divorce they did it in

Carrington and Rash, were solely and simply equal protection

10

cases.

They are cases saying that specialised discriminations

n

with respect to voting are barred by the Equal Protection Clause

12

alone.

13

In Evans and Cornman I note was as it appears in

14

the books, a unanimous decision; at least no dissenting votes

15

were stated.
And so we have two lines of cases: one, a series

16
17

of cases holding that state control of voting rights is subject

18

t© the Equal Protection Clause even though there is no racial

19

or ethnic ©r religious basis for discrimination? even though it

20

doesn't come within the classic, historial foundation of the

21

14th Amendment.
The leading cases on this are Carrington against

22
23

Rash, Kramer against the Union Free School District and Evans
I

24
25

and Cornman.

•
And then we have a second line of cases that the
42

1

enforcement clauses of the 14th and the 15th Amendments give

2

C^igiress powers analogous to the necessary and proper clauses

3

and on -chat I would cite three cases: Katzenbach against

4

McClung , which involved .the necessary and proper clause itself

5

with respect to the commerce power? .and South Carolina against

0

K&tzenbach which involved the enforcing clauses of -the 13th ,

7

14th and 15fch Amendments? and Katzenbach against Morgan, on

8

which the Court relied and I think could only have relied to

9

achieve the results on the 14th Amendment alone and not on the

10

15th.Amendment's enforcing clause.
Q

11

should a state make a provision that Negroes will vote in the
morning and white people in the afternoon which I don't suppose
would violate the 15th Amendment, I can conceive that Congress
would have power under that provision to make that invalid.
Q

I haven't seen that argued, though, as an

independent argument in any of the briefs.
A
in the briefs -that

"The manner clause."

There is some suggestion in the casee and
Presidential electio

are peculiarly

Federal; that the right to vote in them is an inherent right of
Federal citizenship and tthat Congress would have power, perhaps
under the necessary and proper clause to make provisions with
respect to voting in Federal elections and that does become
somewhat relevant in the cases which we will argue, except for
what I would call "fringe" situations.

I think I would agree

with you that but for the 14th Amendment in the cases X have

With hindsight on the basis of my argument

the 15th Amendment could have been don® by statute except that
Congress could have repealed the statute.

Similarly the 19th

Amendment could have been done by statute except that Congress
could have repealed the statute.

Both of those are now, and

I think, fortunately, firmly fixed in -the constitution and are
not merely a matter of statutory provisions? whereas

,

visions with respect to literacy it may be much wiser to have
them so that they can be modified at some later time by
statutory enactment and it may well be true with respect to the
voting age.

We may find for some reason or other that 18 doesn't

work out and that Congress may find it appropriate to repeal
that statute and the states will then have that much greater
leeway.
Q

I thought that
it is the contention of at
\
45

1

least somebody, Friends of the Court in this case that, having

2

enacted the statute, it cannot be repealed, relying on Section

— or footnote 10 in the Morgan opinion and relying on Cases

5

A

are found in the Equal Protection Clause itself.

But I would

have no doubt that Congress, having undertaken to enforce the
Equal Protection Clause by a statute passed 'under Section 5,
achieving a result which is greater than that which is caused by
the Equal Protection Clause itself as in Morgan, as here, would
have the power to repeal that statute by which it had undertaken
to enforce the —
Q

Well, if this isn't within the Equal

Protection Clause itself, where did it come from?
A

It comes from Section 5 and the necessary

and proper concept which is included in Section 5 which, as
United States against Darby, as Katzenbach against McClung, as
Everard Breweries shows and may- urge Congress to go beyond that
which is formally prohibited by the constitution itself,
Q

Well ~

It seems to me that's the consequence of

line have to b® drawn someplace?

Doesn’t a

Of course a line has to be

drawn and the question is whether Congress can draw one.
Persons who are 18 to 20 years old are a class or
group, which obvious enough that -they have interests which are
not always represented by older citizens.

You can’t blush this

off simply by saying that our 18 to 20-yeaf) olds are just
typical of everybody else in the community.

On that’basis you

could have a statute passed by a state which could say that "only
citizens whoa® names begin with G will be entitled to vote.
They are a fair sample and it would be a lot cheaper to conduct
elections on that basis, so we911 proceed that way."

And that

obviously would b© invalid but, why 18?
Well, X was troubled by this for quite a while,
but X finally resolved it in my own mind and in a way that at
least seemed to me to be fairly clear.

Suppose a state said tha^

no one under 40 could vote, or that no one over 65 could vote.
If one looks only at Article I, Section 2, a state could do that
Perhaps this Court could strike it down under the Equal

25

47

1

Protection Clause, but on that basis the Court would have,

2

eventually, to draw the line and the state next year would come

3

up and pass: nobody under 39 and nobody under 38.

4

But, can there be any doubt that Congress could

5

pass this action under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment to en­

8

force the Equal Protection Clause which would invalidate

7

statutes such as I have suggested?
Q

3
9

What do you have to say about Professor

Wright's response to that?

10

point?

11

that didn't matter —

12

Do you recall his response to that

I think someone suggested 45 as the limit and he said

A

Well, what I am suggesting, Mr. Justice,

13

is that Congress could, under Section 5, undoubtedly invalidate

14

such a provision but once you accept that is it not clear that

13

Congress has power to fix the line, as an escapable element of

18

its power to enforce the 14th Amendment; otherwise the court

17

would have to be passing on a succession of statutes and

13

finally fixing the line itself and this is peculiarly the kind

19

of line which, it seems to me that Congress is better qualified

20

to fix than this Court is.

21

Q

Mr. Solicitor General —

22

Q

What would you say about a statute passed

23
24
25

by Congress that made the voting age 10, age 10?

And if you

say that they could draw the line for the state.
A

On that, Mr. Chief Justice, I am tempted
48

1

fall back on Justice Holmes8 dictum with, respect to the power

2

to tax: "The power to tax is the power to destroy," and that

3

the power to tax is not the power to destroy while this court

4

sits.

actually that is its judgment that that is what it should do,

7

which I find it hard to contemplate doing, undoubtedly there is

Q

'You link arras with Professor Wright in

your response there.
A

13

Except that I think that Congress has

14

authority to do it, at least down to the age of 18 and I don’t

15

run into the problem which you raise, which is a problem, until

IS

Congress has gone a good deal further than it has now.
Q

17

Mr. Solicitor General, suppose that last

13

term some 18-year-olds had challenged the 21-year-old requiremen ts

19

of the states and we had decided that the 21-year-old voting

20

requirement, age requirement did not violate the Equal Protec­

21

tion Clause; that a state may limit the vote to those who were

22

21.

23
24
25

Then Congress passes this law and the law is challenged and

we — may we or must we, under Katzenbach, say that -- could we
say, "Although we adhere to our view of last term, that the 21year-old age requirement does not violate the Equal Protection
49

1

2

Clause, we nevertheless sustain this Act of Congress?
A

Yes, Mr. Justice, I think that you would be

3

required to do that and under your decisions that's exactly what

4

happened with respect to literacy.

5

Q

What would be appropriate then in the

8

Congressional legislation in that respect?

7

assertion by Congress that the Court was —

8
9

A

Is this just an

No, Mr. Justice; the language that the

Court has used is "perceive a basis" and I don't think this is

10

a matter of building a record like in a court case where you

11

have to have evidence to support the findings of the court, but

12

there would have to be either findings by Congress or legis­

13

lative history which would provide material from which this

14

Court could perceive a basis for what Congress has done.

15
16
17

Q

Well, would we then be changing our minds

from last term?
A

No, Mr. Justice.

You would be saying that

18

though this is not a violation of Equal Protection as prescribed

1©

by Section 1 of the Constitution it is the kind of thing that

20

Congress can do if, in its judgment it thinks it is necessary in,

21

order to enforce the Equal Protection Clause, just as the power

22

to regulate intrastate commerce, never given by the constitution

23

to Congress, is frequently upheld by this Court as an inherent

24

-- as a proper exercise of power under the necessary and proper

25

clause to enforce the power of Congress to regulate interstate
50

1

commerce.
Q

2

Because of its impact on interstate com­

3

merce, but here if the Equal Protection Clause doesn’t require

4

18-year-olds to be given the vote what -- how could you per­

5

ceive a basis for Congressional enforcement of something that

6

the Equal Protection Clause doesn't require at all?
A

7

Mr. Justice, 1 don’t want to overstate it.

8

I think it is a very close question.

9

delicate, shall I say, here than in the commerce situation be­

10

I think it is much more

cause there you can — at least we have a long tradition that

11

the intrastate commerce has an effect on interstate commerce,

12

but I think that that bridge was really passed in Katzenbach

13
14
15

18
17

IB
19
20
21

22

against Morgan, where there was no suggestion that the discrim­
ination against foreign language schools was invalid under the
Equal Protection Clause — no one had ever held that it was in­
valid.

Indeed, in the case immediately following, although it’s

complicated by the fact that the statute was passed by Congress,
the question arose simply as an attack on the New York courts
under the New York statute and this Court found it invalid, not
under the Equal Protection Clause, but under Section 5 of the
Equal Protection Clause, pursuant to the power of Congress to
enforce.
Q

23
24
25

wasn't it?

That was a sort of double-barrel decision?

In the sense that •—
A

No, Mr. Justice I don't —
51

1

Q

In the sense that these two bases were —

2

A

I don't think,, for example, that the

3

decision by itself, without any Act of Congress, would be

4

applicable to children who, let us say, in Hawaii, had studied

5

only in the Hawaiian language schools or to children who, in

6

this country, for one reason or another, had studied only in

7

German language or some other languages schools.

8

to Spanish language schools and thus might be applicable, per­

9

haps in part of Texas if there were such schools.

It does apply

There are not

10

state schools in Texas which are not in English, but there might

be private schools.

yet, I think, and I don't recall what you said in your brief

about the essence of the second sentence of Section 2 of the

15

14th Amendment, relating to the penalty in effect, the sanction

16

on the states for denying the vote to a citizen under 21.

17

A

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I suppose that

18

Section 2 of the 14th Amendment is the most abortive provision

19

which still remains in the amendment.

20

odd to me that the only effect it has ever had in American

21

history would be to qualify or negative the power expressly

22

given to Congress by Section 5 of the 14th Amendment, but I

23

don't think that there is anything in Section 2 which in any way

24

qualifies the power given to Congress by Section 5.
Q

Itwould seein a little

Do you think it would have a tendency to
52

1

deter the states from having this abnormal voting age we dis­

z

cussed earlier, 40 or 45?
A

3

Would it have a deterrent effect?

Yes; I suppose that it might, as a

4

practical matter, have had a deterrent effect from having an

5

age above 21, although it hasn’t been enforced as to its other

6

aspects and, whether, as a practical matter, it could be en­

7

forced in that sense by reducing representation in Congress if

8

states went «above 21 I don’t know, but I don’t think that there

9

is anything in Section 2 which has any bearing on ages less thar

10

21.
That’s too strong»

17

19

20
21

It stated age 21»

24
25

It certainly reflected the understanding of

the time that that was the current voting age.

I do not think

it can be said that Article I, Section 2 prescribes 21 as the
voting age for any purpose.

For example:- suppose a state did

pass a statute such as I have said and nobody under 40 can vote;
under Article II they might lose their representation, but

j

there is nothing in Article II which would say that persons
between 21 and 30 can vote because of Article II»
whatever, because Article II says

Nothing

21 that wouldn't prevent

states from saying you can’t vote unless you are 40.
The only thing that could prevent astate from

22
23

It obviously has some bearing»

doing that would be the Equal Protection Clause itself, Section
1.
Q

Well, doesn’t this afford some kind of
53

1

a backstop to it, though , as an alternative measure?

I would say "background," but 1 don't know

about "backstop„"

15

It takes ma aback a little»

I suppose it's partly because no states

have ever undertaken to fix age 40 —
A

17

Oh, but states did on a wholesale basis

18

keep people from voting, contrary to the provisions of Section

19

2 of Article XIV, for 50 or 75 veers in this country and nothing

20

was done about it.

21

Q

Not on the ag® basis that we.Pre —

22

A

Not on an age basis, but on, as far as

23

Section 2 is concerned it was equally applicable to that elimina1-

24

tion.

25

Q

Do you think might offer — the fact that

54

1

the current 21 years of age you referred to as current, the

2

voting age, was exercised properly by the states, since it did

3

not affect race?

4

A

5

Q

That's what I se.yi 21 years of age.

6

A

Well, I think that the provisions of

21 years —

7

Section 2 of the 14th Amendment provides an entrance upon which

8

there is some tendency to conclude that 21 was contemplated as

9

the voting age.

That it was within their power; yes.

I don't suppose anybody has ever questioned

— to decide what the age qualifications

20

A

No one has ever questioned that 21 as

22

fixed by the states is a perfectly valid provision under the

23

Equal Protection Clause unless and until Congress undertakes to

24

exercise the power expressly given to Congress by Section 5 of

25

the 14th Amendment to enforce the Equal Protection Clause.
55

1

Q

Wall, I suppose you would agree — I'm not

2

arguing now with you at all —* but 1 suppose you would agree

3

that there are some powers

4

states have that that 5th provision of the amendment wouldn't

5

justify taking away from it?

6

A

to fix qualifications that the

Yes, Mr. Justice, I think that's true and

7

I'm sure that was contemplated when it was written, but I find

8

it very hard to find very clear and convincing instances of

9

things which the state can do which Congress cannot change with

10

respect to voting, by action under Section 5 of the 14th Amend­

11

ment.

12

Q

That's a pretty drastic —

13

A

I think it must be recognized that the

14

power of Congress under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment as

15

recognized bythis Court in Katzenfoack against Morgan, is © very

16

broad power.
Q

17

Which would give the right to fix the ages

18

of the voters who must vote for constable» and inferior officers

19

like that?
A

20

Yes, Mr. Justice, if Congress chooses to

21

exercise the power to that extent, and I can imagine situations

22

where that would be very important.
Q

23

Would your response to that, Mr. Solicitor

24

General, be the same if Congress had fixed 20 years and three

25

months?
56

1

A

Yes, Mr. Justice, I can imagine a bill
»

2

being passed by the House and being passed by the Senate and

3

going to conference and in conference it*s like 27 and a half

4

percent depletion.

5

in conference and this bill might well have turned out 19-and-a-

6

half instead of 18.

7

the bill of age 18 and 2 think it’s not irrelevant that the key

3

vote in the Senate, reilly on the issue of whether it should be

9

don© by statute or by constitutional amendment, was 64 to 17.

We got that because that was a compromise

Actually, both Houses of Congress did adopt

/

10

There was a very strong sentiment in the Senate that it could be

11

don© by statute.

When it went back to the House the House
\

12

13

accepted the Senate Amendment and there was no division there.
Q

I suppose,.Mr. Solicitor General, your

14

view as to Katsenbach against Morgan would apply not only to the

15

Equal Protection Clause, but also to the Due Process Clause,

16

would it, of the 14th Amendment?

17

A

Of the 14th Amendment, yes? I have no

18

doubt, Mr, Justice, that if Congress finds that some action of

19

a state could be a denial of due process that it could pass a

20

statute within considerable limits.

21

forced me back to ten years and I preferred to stand on five.

22

I think there are places beyond which the power under Section 5

23

would not extend the voting and I suppose at some point this

24

Court would have to decide whether the statute undertaking to

25

enforce the Due Process Clause was so unrelated to that
57

The Chief Justice,has

objective that it wag not within the famous language of Chief

2

Justice Marshall as an appropriate exercise of a necessary and

proper power.

factor for people to take into account, if you recall that?

Q

Would that conceivably be a rational basis

where we could proceed — with the language of Morgan and —
A

12

It’s conceivably rational, but I should

think,highly undesirable and it seems to me that if we are going

14

to have a Federal law with respect to this that it ought to be

nationwide and that would apply to the southern tip of Florida

and to Point Barrow, Alaska, as far as I am concerned, as a

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

2

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT,

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFFS

4

MR. WRIGHT:

5

6

Very well.

I will endeavor, seeing the clock, to

make my points rapidly.
First, with regard to the question that Justice

7

Harlan and Justice Stewart asked about separability, I believe

8

that Section 205 of the statute provides a sufficient answer.

9

It is a separability clause, part of the 1970 legislation it-

10

self; it appears in a sort of funny place.

11

to find severability clauses at the end of a statute, but this

12

particular Title III was added as a rider in the Senate.

13

was the final section as it passed the House; it does speak

14

generally to the Act.

15

You generally expect

It

So, the age provisions of Title III can be

16

separated from the literacy and durational residency provisions

17

of the. other portions of the act.

18

I would not wish my argument to have been under­

19

stood at all as suggesting that the 14th Amendment, and spe­

20

cifically the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment do

21

not reach the question of voter qualifications.

22
23
24
25

I recognize

the force of the historical arguments that Justice Harlan has
mustered on several occasions, but my own conclusion has been
that the whole history of the 39th Congress and the various
legislation and the constitutional amendments it produced is
59

1

sufficiently inconclusive about interpreting those provisions

2

of the constitution.

3

stitutional language that to try to discern the intend of the

4

framers.

5

It is better simply to look at the con­

My recollection is that in Harper v. Board of

6

Elections it was argued here that one of the members of the

7

Court inquired if Virginia could deny the franchise to persons

8

who had red hair and the answer, since the position they argued

9

was that the Equal Protection Clause was totally inadequate for,

15
16
17

18

the answer was, "Yes."
Now, I do not envy counsel who was in a position
where he had to give that answer.

Plainly a discrimination that

invidious is one that would be very odd if the Equal Protection
Clause didn’t reach.
And so cases such as Evans v. Cornman in which my
friend the Solicitor General finds great comfort, do not
trouble me at all.

They seem — the are wholly consistent with

the position we take here that voter qualifications may be a
matter within the account of the Equal Protection Clause, but
that this particular qualification that we sure defending in this
case is not one that either this Court or the Congress can
rationally say falls afoul of the Equal Protection Clause of the
4th Amendment.
The principal burden of my argument in chief was
that to sustain this statute would be to replace a system of

25
60

1

constitutional Federalism with a system of Congressional

2

Federalism»

3

peculiarly inappropriate with regard to the political arrange­

4

ments of the states that Congress should be allowed to decide

5

for itself the extent of its power to order the political

6

arrangements in Texas and other states„

7

/-aid I undertook to suggest to you that this seems

Twenty-eight years ago George Braden wrote an

8

article in the Chicago Law Review called "Umpire to the Federal

9

System," and it seems to me that that is one of the highest

10

functions of this Court, that when disputes arise between

11

Congress and the states as to their respective powers we can’t

12

ask Congress to decide whether it is safe throughout; we come

13
14

here because this Court in the tradition of Marlborough v.
Madison, it must make that decision.
X

20

25

I think that it would not be only constitutional
Fofisualism that would be jeopardized by the decision against us
here, but we would also run a great risk of replacing constitu­
tional liberty, the Congressional liberty, because I have the
diffulty that Justice Harlan indicated from the bench with
regard to footnote 10 in the Morgan opinion, and it is hard to
see what Congress might not do if Congress were to be given as
broad a scope as argued under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment.
It is true, as the Solicitor General says, that
Section 2 of the 14th Amendment is old; it is one that is
probably little used as ineffective a provision as appears in th«
61

1

constitution but it is there and I do not think the constitu­

2

tional provisions wither away.by --or the words that were

3

adopted bytha country in Section 2 of the 14th Amendment are

4

any less potent today simply because they have not been in­
