HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

z

We’5 hear argument in No.

, Citizens to Preserve Overton Park against Secretary John
Volpe. Mr. Vardaman, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.

ARGUMENT OF HR. JOHN W. VARDAMAN, JR. ESQ.

4

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

S
6

MR. VARDAMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

7

Court. This case is here today on application for study pend­

0

ing the filing of a petition for writ of

certiorari.

We seek an application to stay the respondents in this

9

10

case. The Secretary of Transpotattion and the Commissioner for

1?

the Department of Highways for the State of Tennessee, from

12

authorising the beginning of construction of a six lane inter­

13

state highway which will pass through Overton Park, a large,

14

public park located in Memphis, Tennessee.

13

If this stay is not granted, the respondents will auth­

16

orise construction and that construction will proceed before

17

this Court has an opportunity to act on a petition for Writ of

18

Certiorari.
That construction will inflict grave and irreparable

19

damage to the park.

20

Q.

tiorari7

—— the latest date for issuance of Writ of Cer-

Your Honor, I think, we have until January

28th.

I believe, towards the end of January. However, as we suggested

24

in the brief which we filed, we are willing to have the Court

25

4
i

1

act upon these papers as a Petition for Writ of Certiorari

2

we can meet the formal requirements by filing a petition with

3

the clerk» We are ready to proceed immediately» We have not

4

filed a petition thusfar because there is the threat if stay

But we are willing to proceed immediately with the fil­

G

Q

--- to cooperate with any expedited schedule of the”*

S

A

Certainly--—

10

Q

That we're discussing»

11

A

That’s correct»

12

If the respondents are permitted to proceed with this con­

13

struction they may likely meet this case» If they do, they

14

will have been successful without ever having filed an answer

15

to the Petitioners complaint, without putting one witness on

16

the witness stand, without having one other official subject to

17

examination by deposition, but instead rely on a basis of out

18

of court litigation affadavits filed t:n support of a motion for

19

summary judgement»

20
21

That’s the record in this case. So, the decision below
was based soley on affadavits» The District Court granted sum-

.

many judgement, it was affirmed by the Court of Appeals,
This case arises under a statute passed in 1966, which
articulates a national policy of preserving park plans, recre­
ation areas, historic sates, water fowl, and wildlife refuges.

5

?

That statute provides that the Secretary of Transportation

2

shall not approve any project which affects a parkland or a

ortj

recreation area unless there are no feasible alternati vs, or

4

unless the design of the project includes all possible planning

5

to minimise harm.

S

The park which is involved in this case, is a large,

7

342 acre public park located in Memphis, Tennessee. It has

0

within it approximately 170 acres of woodland forest, as of

0

1965 this constituted,

one half of the city of Memphis.

10

Memphis is woodland forest. If this highway goes through that

11

part of the park, according to Department of Interior officials

n

who oppose tliis project there will be very little left of the

13

woodland forest.

14

Q

Could I interrupt you a moment and go back to the

IS

question that Justice Stewart asked? As far as you’re concerned

16

are you billing to treat this argument as an argument on the

17

merits as distinguished from application per se?

13
19

A

Your Honor we’re willing to treat this argument as

an argument on the merits as well—-

20

Q

That’s the way I read your papers--

21

A

Yes, if the Court would like to consider this as

22

an argument on the merits, we’re willing to have it treated

23

that way.

24
25

This highway project involves a construction of a six
lane interstate highway with the right of way between 250 feet
6

1

and 450 feet wide. As it proceeds through the wooded area, of

2

the park if it’s constructed as is presently planned, it will

3

take a swath of 450 feet out of the wooded section they will

4

pass through a small picturesque lake, in the park. It will

5

pass immediately adjacent to the soo, it will be a little

a

barrier to either side of the park. It will literally cut this

7

park in two.

8

Q

0

is correct ?

10

A

11
12

Is this 450 feet, that’s 150 yards if my mathematics

Yes, it is Your Honor. I- think that’s an undisputed

fact on this record.
Q

And is it undisputed that to depress this highway

13

was going to cost some 20 million dollars just to —-- depress

14

it as distinguished from tunnelling it.

IS

A

No. Your Honor, the figures in this record are for

10

tunneling and they suggest two types of tunnels. They would

17

cost, they estimate, they don’t have any calculations, just

18

estimates, wou3d cost up to 40 million dollars.

19

There is, however, a suggestion that was made by Depart­

20

ment of Interior officials, for a fully depressed route, which

21

would not be a tunnel, and the real cost figures on that

22

design*—-

23
24
25

Q

I thought someone tossed in a figure of 20 million

dollars in relation to that.
A

I think there is an estimate of 40 million dollars.
7

1

but that involves fully depressing and then totally covering

2

it. What is now, as I understand as a cut and cover tunnel.

3

If you simply depressed it all the way through the park, that

4

would minimise harm to the forest, but there are no cost figures

5

on that.

0

I might point out, incidentally, that they have raised an

7

objection that this would create certain drainage problems,

3

there's a small creek that runs throught the forest and they

9

maintain that they can't go past that creek with a depressed

«0
11

12

route o
There are affadavits on trial, in this case, that suggest
that that diffuculty can be overcome fcy standard engineering
f

13

techniques which are in use in the interstate system just today,

14

have been in use in the interstate system for some time.

15

Yet they refuse to yse them on this case.

16

Q

What is the acreage of the park?

17

A

The acreage of the park, Your Honor is 342 acres.

18

Q

How much would be taken?

19

A

Twenty six centrally located acres will be taken.

20

Q

If I have the figures, I think that the plans are

21

to depress the highway, except where it crosses the stream.

22

A

That’s correct-- *

23

Q

They say it has to cross a grade in order to elimO

24

25

inate a drainage problem.
A

That's correct, Your Honor, but--—

8

1

tile problem with that is that the stream is only slightly west

2

of the center of the park and they actually go above! grade at

3

that point, so , although they depress it in the eastern part

4

of the park as it rises to -that portion of it ab£vt grade a

5

substantial part £>£ it is at grade--—

8

Q

It's an east-west highway, is it?

7

A

That's correct» This is part of a transcontinental

Q

east-west interstate---

9

Q

And the park lies in the westward part of Memphis?

to

A

The park lies praetitally in the middle of the city»

11

If you look at a map of Memphis---

12

Q

West of Memphis is the ^Mississippi River,

1.3

A

That’s correct. This park is practically in the mid­

14

dle of the city,

13

Q

That’s where the sod is.

16

A

Thar's correct. This highway will run adjacent to the

17
18

sou "hern boundary of the soo right now.
This

highway was approved in November of 1969. This

action

19

was filed immediately

20

way was approved there was a study of several alternative route :i

21

One which

would ssdng immediately to the north of the park, and

22

one which

would swing immediately south of the park, and

23

my understandingtthat Mr. Reynolds will bring a map into

24

Court during his argument. He’ll show you, wifeh bands on the

25

map, where these alternatives would go.

thereafter. Prior to the time this

9

high­

it's

1

Now in the Department of Transporationa, in the Secretarys

2

papers'^ which are on file, these maintain that those alternati­

3

ves were rejected because of large displacement of persons and

4

businesses» And in his affadavit he gives you some statistics

5

as to the number of people which would be displaced by the

Q

route which goes to the north, and that which goes to the

7

south» What he aoesn’t give you in the affadavit is the num­

8

ber Qf people who would be adversely affected, not only in the

0

use of the park, but in their homes and businesses by the route

10

which uses the park»
And when you search the record further and find those

11

!2

statistic® that demonstrate that the alternative to the nofth

13

of the park which he rejected actually neither displaces

14

more people from their homes or adversely affects them in their

IS

businesses or schools» So the test which he assetrs he's app­

16

lied in this case, was misapplied if the test is fehe number of

17

people which weald be adversely affected or the number of

13

people who would be displaced from their homes.
The route to the north according to their own calculations

m

zo

will

21

route through the park, according to their own figures will

22

adversely affect or displace

23

people than the ©oute to the north.

24
25

either displace or adversely affect 2,386 people, the

2,60? people» Actually more

And this is the case even though in their calculations
they made no allowance for the people, they have not counted
10

1

as adversely affected, people who use the park* For instance,

2

over a million people a year use this zoo, and they haven8t

3

calculated the affect on those people*

4

Q

How would you calculate that, Mr* Vardaman?

5

A

Your Honor—-

6

Q

They won't stop using the park, will -they?

7

A

Some of them may stop using the park, some of them

Q

may not. But one of the problems in trying to use mathematical

9

formulas in a dispute of this kind is that it's difficult to

10

quantify the values of a parkland. And that’s what one of the

11

reasons this statute was passed —- decisions have isaen made

12

on locating highways on -the basis of cost, and residencies

1.3

dislocated and where you have decisions made that way, the

14

values of the parkland, the aesthetic values, the recreational

IS

values, were often overlooked.

18

And that s&as one of the motivating forces for the passage

17

of this act*

13

Q

19
20

Approximately when was all the clearance to the'

approaches completed? A year ago, two years ago, how long?
A

The record shows that that construction began in 196"

21

They authorized acqusition of the right of way, they began to

22

acquire it parcel by parcel, by 1968 the record shows that

23

much of it had been acquired.

24
2S

Q

Well, at that time, it was reasonably clear that

they were going through the park.
11

A.

1

No. Your Honor. At that time,, the Secretary of

2

Transportation in a letter to Citizens to Preserve Overton

3

Park, stated that the Federal Highway Adininistrationhad told

4

the Memphis City Council in April of 1968, the Department of

5

Trnasportation had no final decision ori the location of this

G

highway.
Q

7

G

Mien was it clear that the route would go through

the park, approximately?
A

D

That8s one of the difficulties of this case. The

10

final decision was made in .1369, November of 1969. A previous

11

decision, and whether that &as the type of decision that could

12

not have .been changed, is simply not clear.
Q

13

14

IS

atory judgement, an injunction, have been a remedy, in
your view?
A

16
17

20
21

22
23
24
25

It certainly would have. That's exactly what we

sought. A declaratory judgement, or an injunction.
I understand that YOur Honor is troubled by the poinfe.

!3

19

At that stage, in 1969, in November, would a declar­

of granting an injunction against this highway where there
has been clearing of this right of way through the park, but
I think, it's important to bear in mind the sequence of events
here.
They began clearing that right of way fully two years
before any final decision was made and much of it was acquired
at the time the Department of transportation was saying we
12

1

have no final decision on this matter.

2

Now, if the Secretary is to be allowed to thwart any

3

revfew of his decisions by this piecemeal acquisition of right

4

of way right up to the park, then the administration, the

5

effectiveness of this statute is whittled away„
Because, every time he h&s a controversial project it

6

7

would be possible to box himself in, and to box the Court in

Q

and to present you with a fait accompli simply by acquiring
!

the right of way right up to the park before he approves the

10

part which involves the park.
And, can I point out that it's only once he approves that

11
12

part that the citizens have a cause of action under the stat­

13

ute, under which this action was brought. In other wordsJ, there

14

has to be a final agency action involving the park before we

is"

can bring the suit and obtain review,

IS
17
18
1
20

23
24
2S

That's a suit under the act?

A

That's correct. ’And therefore our cause • of' * action
v\. *■ •

did not accrue until November 1969, And we then met with the
defense, well, we acquired this right of qay before approving
t

~ which includes the park,
Q

21
22

Q

Mr, Varda^^m,. what are the issues you're presenting

to us? Is the first one whether he's made the required stat­
utory

finding?
A

That’s correct, Yo&r Honor,

Q

And even if he had, your second issue is that his
13

1

findings are infirm.

2

A

3

The first issue, we have maintained throughout, is a

That's correct.

4

disputed issue of fact, but we've framed iis in presenting it

S

to this Court, we've framed it a little differently.
It’s landisputed that at the time he made these decisions

6

7

there was no contemporaneous documentation., He never made

0

a record, and we maintain that even if he made a mental

9

finding, simply decided in his own mind, that that's inadequate

10

here. We also maintain that, he never made such a-Q

11

Well, so'aid your first point be mooted if he pre­

12

sented in this Court a piece of paper that made the findings

13

tha^ you say are missing?
A

14

IS

I think that first point would be mooted. We would

then proceed to whether or not the determination was infirm.

IS

Q

Well, his brief pretty well makes that, doesn't it?

17

A

I don't think it does, Your HOnor. Let me point

18

out that there is one contemporaneous document which he

19

produced for YOur Honor, and that's a press release.

20

We litigated this case in the District Court-—

21

Q

*/

But nevertheless, it would moot the point now if

22

he presents the piece of paper now if he hasn’t already done

23

so?

24

q

25

A

That’s correct. And he ahsn’fc done so, not in the

explicit terms which I think thi.l Court should demand, in
14

1
2

order to review what he did,,
But I want to go back to one point involving the press

3

release. He seemed to take the position that he felt the

4

route had been determined, and as to whether he made any de-

5

cision as to alternative routes, I think is open to question.

6
7

Q

And your second point is what? Is it that his de­

cision was wrong?

0

A

That is an additional point.

9

The second point which, could possibly also be mooted if

10

he gave a satisfactory written determination, although I

11

wouldn’t conceed that it would be xaooted, is that the Court

12

below, even though the Secretary made no documentation of

13

his finding that this Courts decision in Untied States against

14

Morgan prohibited any inquiry of the secretary as to whether

15

he did make the finding.

16

And the difficulty which is presented to anyone seeking

17

review under the statute, seeking enforcement under the statute

18

unde the holdings below, is that first the secretary is not

19

required to record the fact that he made the determination

20

to require that statute, and those seeking review aren't en­

21

titled to ask him whether he made it.

22

The court below simply doesn't a&ewer the question of

23

how those who seek review are to ever to be able to deter­

24

mine whether------

25

Q

He presented an affastavit saying that he had made
15

1

them»

s

A

The affadavit has bean construed that way. It is

s

much less than clear from that affadavit that he made these

4

decisions. And we have contended throughout that there is

5

a dispute on that issue.

6

How, the affadavit is set out partly in the briefs and

7

it’s in the record, I won’t go through it word by word, but

8

riathesi than saying the secretary made the decision that there

9

are no feasible improvenemt alternatives, which he could have

io

said, had he made the determination, the affadavit is very,

?!

very vague.

12

Q

13

Assuming you didn’t get by, you didn’t prevail on

those two points, what standard—-assume the secretary had made

14

the findings and you're challenging the sufficiency, what

15

standard are you urging the Courts must use in reviewing the

'16

administrative decision?

1?
I®
19

A

I think the proper standard in this case is that

suggested by Judge Celebrezse below whether it’s supported by
substantial evidence. The substantial evidence test under the

2©

administrative procedure act

21

a hearing required by statute and there are hearings in this

22

case which are required by—-

23

24

as

is required where there has been

Q

Yes, but not by him.

A

Not by him, that’s correct, but there are statute—-

Q

He doesn’t have to give notices (inaudible) fyo to the

I

s

®
?
@

hearings and takes the evidence, under the statute»
A

He doesn't, but ’the transcripts of the hearings have

to be forwarded to him» And if the standard is not the sub™
stantial evidence, it would

3 entirely possible that the

secretary flight simply dis.,

ard the evidence in one of those

hearings»
If it’s merely an arbitrary and capricious standard, and
the Court looked only to that evidence which supported his
decision, as opposed to the entire record, and gave some con™

it

ts
m
is
m

So we suggest the substantial evidence test»
Q

Your first part, on the absence of formal findings

as I read the government pap&rs at least so far as the future
is concerned, they've corrected that by regulation, now, to
provide for formal findings, is that right?

if
A

s®

If I recall the governments brief, I think that8s

la policy which has been adopted which has been changed ©nee

ii
we don't know whether it will be changed again, we don't know
2§
whether it will be waived in particular cases, there is some
3!
effort along this line, as I understand it, but I don't think

22
that that is any reason that this Court shouldn't consider

28
that issue.

SI
I -think that if we assert these findings required for

SB
17

'i

judicial review, in order to make sure that, we have these

a

findings in every case, 1 think this Court should so hold»

3

Q

But that is a factor thwfc would be a legitimate one,

4

in the reles of our Court in deciding whether or not to grant

5

a Petition for Certiorari. You would agree with'"that, wouldn't

6

you?

7

A

I would agr©e with Your HGnor that it's something

8

to be considered, but I would note that this policy has been

9

amended once, and there is , 1 believe, a Department of Trans­

m

portation memorandum, which is not cited in the briefs, I

ii

could provide you with the citation, whcih states that no poli­

12

cy memoranda or no regulations are intended to create any

13

rights in private parties, and I think the intent of that is

14

to say we may have a policy such as this but if we don't obey

IS

it in any particular place, you citizens don't have any re­

16

vie v;.

17

And unless this Court holds differently, more courts are

18

undoubtedly going to follow the Sixth Circuits desision that

19

he need make no formal findings.

20

Furthermore, I thisik it's important that another important

21

issue in this case is a question of whether we can obtain a

22

summary judgement soley on the basis of affadavits instead of

23

submitting to the court on motion for summary judgement, the

24

record on which he acted. Instead he submits affadavits which

25

charagterize that record and we think that---

18

1

Q

Is that affadavit part of the record for us?

s

A

Yes* it is* Your Honor. That’s the affadavit of

3

4

Mr. Edgar Swick.
I would suggest to Your Honors that because of the nar­

S

row* constrictive judicial review which the Sixth Circuit

6

dictates in cases of this nature that if that decision is not

7

reversed it practically precludes any effective judicial re­

3

view* under the statutes on which we rely.

D

For that reason I suggest that this is a case of extreme

10

federal importance in the emerging federal effort to protect

11

the environment* a® worthy of consideration by this Court.

12

Thank you.

13

Q

This statute was rather recently enacted?

14

A

1966* yes.

15

Q

Yes* and then amended in 1968 or 1969* I think.

16

A

Yes

17

Q

Nov, the res some indication in the record that basic

13

•decision was

19

A

That is correcto

20

Q

If that’s true* then I suppose the statute-wouldn't

21

be applicable at all* would it?

Let me explain what else is in the record.

23

Q

All right.

24

A

25

*

The record does say the decision was made in 1956.

However, its clear that with respect to the alternatives that
19

i

will be shown to you on this map that's brought in , the one

z

immediately nor tit and the one immediately south of the park

3

those weren't even studied until 1965 and the federal high­

4

way administratio was still suggesting to the city council

S

his alternatives in 1968«

6

And that there is, in the record in tills case P a doe urns at

7

a letter from the Secretary of Transpofeat&on which indic@ftfes

Q

in 1968 we had no final decision on this route.

£>

So although some prelirainary decision may have been made

10

in 1956,, and we don't know the nature of that preliminary

11

decision, it's clear that the Secretary of Transportation

12

was exploring alternatives in 1968 and rejected those

13

alternatives, Thank you.

14

Q

Could I ask you one more question? Now, suppose that

15

you prevail, we couldn't interfere with the state going

16

ahead and doing what it wished if it used its own park facility.

17

A

Dependant on what project the state wished to use

18

itw own funds for. If tne state wishes to build a highway in

19

this park with its own funds, to

20

to be linked with an interstate highway on the west of the

21

park artd on the east of the park and to provide the missing

22

linl of Interstate 40, I think that the state would be acting

23
24
25

interstate specifications,

in concert with and as an agent of the federal government and
would be susceptible to equity powers of this court. I think
it ®ould be a blatant effort to avoid the requirements of this
20

i

statute, the participation in a federal enterprise, and I

z

think that any effort to circumvent this statute in that man­

3

ner would certainly be correctible by this Court and by any

4

federal court.

S

Q

This property does now belong to the state, its been

6

conveyed by the city, hasn't it?

7

t

A

That's correct.» Your Honor.

3

Q

This acreage.

9

A

That * s correct.

10

Q

And the city has already expended the proceeds, or

11

half of the proceeds for considerably more recreation --- a

12

public golf course, has another substantial part of the

13

proceeds which has been specifically earmarked under local' lav;

14

for the acqusitiorx of park property?

IS

A

That's correct, Your Honor. We think it8s highly

16

appropriate that the city should buy more parkland but we

17

hardly think that the way to raise money for that parkland is

18

selling that which they already have.

19

20

Q

Well, the city will end up with considerably increa­

sed park acreage.

21

A

Taht's correct.

22

Q

Of course, it might be, you might submit that the

23
24

2§

parks are in the wrong place.
A

The quality of idle parks, the accessibility of the

parks the location'of the parks, all of those are important.

21

1

This park has been described as one of the most beauti ful,

a

scenic parks inthe country, and I think that that should be

3

sudMicaent to invoke this statute» Thank you,

ARGUMENT OF MR» WILLIAM BRADFORD REYNOLDS, ESQ,

Thank you, Mr» Vardaman, Mr» Reynolds?

PRO HAC VICE

7

A

8

Secretary of Transportation opposes this stay essentially

9
10

Mr. Chief (Justice*, and may it please the Court.

beacuse the issues to be presented are not of sufficient
importance to warrant a grant of Certiorari.
I will confine my remarks to this aspect of the case.

1!
12

Mr. Hanover, Counsel for Commissioner Spite, will then discuss

13

the effect such a stay will have on the respondents.

14

Interstate I 40, we've been told,--—

IS

Q.

If we can confidently predict that Certiorari would

16

not be granted in this case, even though the majority of the

17

Court might think that the Sixth Cirfcuit was wrong, but if we

18

can confidently predict that Certiorari would not be granted

19

then, then we must vacate the temporary stay and not grant a

20

permanant stay, even though the decision for the Court of

21

Appeals for the Sixth Circuit might be wrong. Does that follow,

22

is that correct?

23

A

We would take—-

24

Q,

I think that if we're going to deny certiorari, then

25

we're going to — it follows
is g

22

that the Court of Appeals decisior

is going to be left undisturbed even though wrong. Correct?
A

Not necessarily, Your Honor. There is involved in

the stay application the question of whether the determination
by the Court of Appeals as to whether there were no undisputed
facts here, and therefore the supporting summary judgement,
6

whether that was a correct determination.

7

And there is—-

8

Q.

9

That arises only if and whan we’ve granted certiorari<

Is that true?

10

A

That question will arise—

n

Q.

Only if certioriai is granted.

12

A

13

this Court, though,—

14
15

That's correct. That question may be considered by

Q,

The question now is the liklihood of granting cer­

tiorari, isn't it?

m

A

i?

Interstate I 40 will cut Overton Park in half, we're told.

That's correct, yes, Your Honor.

18

I would like to add a few pertinent facts with rega&d to that

19

contention. This map shows, and there is marked on the map

20

only the portion of the highway that we're now considering.

21

It does extend on out at the present time, to the ends of this

22

map.

23

The route will run along what is nofe an existing non-

24

access bus road, which includiag the cleared eight of way on

25

either side is presently 40 to 50 «fleet wiSe. Along the noi- h
23

t

edge of the road* from west to east, for about two-thirds the

2

distance of the bus route is a 6~8 foot chain link fence, pre­

3

sently separating the zoo from die rest of the park. The zoo

4

is up in the north area and at the present time the city is

5

expanding the 500 facility eastward.

6

In the northeast corner are the parking lots for the zoo

7

which the city anticipates to expand and improve. Thus essentia]21y

0

Overton Park is south of the bus road. That's where the lake

9

is, that's where the golf course is, that's where the picnic

10

areas are, the outdoor theatre, the art galleries, and most

11

of the woodland. And that remains untouched.

12

Now the highway -itself will take 26 acres of the 342 acre

13

park, and it will involve cutting down 12 acres of trees as

14

opposed to leaving approximately 175 acres untouched.

15
16

17

Turning to the determination. Secretary Boyds approval in
1968 of the route—
Q.

May I interrupt you*. Mr. Reynolds? Could you have

13

your collegue find out for me just to clarify, the outer boun­

19

daries of the park, as the park now exists. I think I under­

20

stand it but I'm not sure.

21

A.

that would be the western boundary, and that would

22

be the eastern boundary. This is the south, and that's the

23

north.

24

Q.

I have the---thank you.

25

L

Now Secretary Boyd approved the route of this pead
24

1

in 1968» This was the first approval after enactment of sec­

2

tion 4F of Department of Transportation Act which has the spec­

3

ific language that is at issue here.

4

At the time that he approved the route, he wrote a letter

5

to the Chairman of Citizens to Preserve Overton Park* He

6

explained the considerations and study that went into the

7

alternate routes at length. And then he concluded that letter

8

with this statement. And 1 quote: "Now that the decision has

9

been made on the specific alignment of the route, I have asked

10

Mr. Bridwell, who is the Federal Highway Administrator, to

1?

develop a number of specific design alternatives in order to

12

minimize danage to the park and its facilities."

13

There was no objection at that time by Petitioners. No

14

suit was commenced and there was no request for injunctive

15

relief.

16

Q.

What year was that?

17

A.

That was in 1968, April of 1968.

18

Now between April of 1968 and November of 1969, the state

19

purchased the right of way from a point where the alternates

20

diverge ifrom the main route on the map, up to the edge of the

21

park, on both sides and they cleared that right of way.

22

In addition the state purchased from the city the 26 acre

23

strip for* 2 million dollars, and in addition state highway

24

officials held design hearings as to what the proper* design

25

should be of the highway through the park.
25

1

In November, on November 5, 1969, after enactment of sec­

2

tion 138, in the Federal Aid Highway Act, Secretary Volpe an­

3

nounced, and I quote/'The hold on the project has been lifted,

4

after the state agreed to adjust the grade line of the depresse*

S

freeway to a point as low as possible»" And that press release

6

further stated, and I quote/’The state has also agreed to take

7

all steps possible to minimize the harm to the park resulting

8

from.the highsay".

davit?

?!

A

Where does all this appear, in the (inaudible) affa-

Your HOnor, the press announcements are attachments

\Z

to the Swick affadavit» The letter to the Chairman 6f the

13

Citizens to Presesve Overton Park is an attachment to the

14

Chairmans affadavit which was put in in this case»

15

Q.

Nowhere could I find, maybe just because I didn't

16

lood hard enough, but nowhere have I found so far, any state­

\7

ment in the language of the statute whether in a press release

?8

or otherwise, that there is no feasible and prudent alternative

19

to putting the highway through the park» Have I just not looked

20

hard enough?

2!

A

22
23
24
25

Your Honor, there is not in the press release that

specific language,
0.

And the press release is what’s relied on for the

finding, isn't it?
A

If I may, Secretary Boyd, in his 1968 press release.
26

I

announced that he had approved the route following the resol­

2

ution of the Memphis city Council. That Resolution reads, and

3

I quote in pertinent part,"Whereas, representatives of the

4

Federal Government have furnished the Council with considerable

5

information and data, to the effect that no other feasible and

6

prudent route is available, now therefore, be it resolved by

7

the Council that the Council finds the route presently desig­

8

nated by the Federal Government through Overton Park as the

3

feasible and prudent location for said route." tod Secretary

10

Boyd in his press announcement said that he «as approving the

11

route on, following that announcement.

12

13

0,
does it?

That doesn't quite add up to the statutory language,
They approved it as the feasible and prudent-- -

14

&>

The Memphis Council approved it—-

15

Q.

Now that's not a finding that there’s no alternative

16

27

feasible and prudent route, is it?
it

Your Honor, they approved it

the feasible and

18

prudent alternative, but they stated that whereas they had

29

been shown by the federal Government that there were? no other

28

feasible and prudent alternatives available.

21

The Federal Government went down to the Memphis City Coun­

22

cil, they explained to them for over 3 and one half hours,

23

indeed Mr. Bridwell did, the different alternative routes that

24

were considered as possibly prudent and feasible, and discussed

23

with the Memphis Gity Council the determination as to the

27

i

prudent and feasible routes.

z

And I add that there was—~

3

Q.

4

What was the standard they used in determining whethei

a route was feasible

and prudent?

S

A

The determination itself, Your Honor?

6

0

What X8m interested in i3 what they based that—

7

if they had made a finding what would the standard be that

8

they followed?

9

A

The determination itself was based on these factors .

10

Now the routes we showed hwre, the alternate routes , ere the

u

ones that have been most predominantly mentioned throughout

12

the deliberations of this project.

13
14

Q,

Mow would you indicate, when you say "the" alternatives

would you have your collegue indicate them on the map?

15

A

16

The one to the south is marked No. 2, the one immediately

Yes, Your Honor.

17

north is No. 3, and the third alternative is the one that

m

runs in a triangular shape.

19

As to the route directly north, it was determined that

29

that would involve taking three schools, involving Southwestern

21

University, and the largest high school in Memphis. It would

22

involve taking several churches, attended by some 4,000 per­

23

sons, It would involve taking a number of residential units,

24

of more than 1500 persons. The

25

The route to the south of the park—
28

Q.

?

Welly the only reason I presume that this didn't

z

involve taking such buildings is because it’s in a park and

s

they didn't have such buildings.

4
5
8

,k

A

The reason that it was not——

Q,

Yes, that's the reason it didn’t involve a lot of

buildings

—

7

A.

That's correct, Your Honor—-

S

Q.

Are you taking the position that the cost of these

9
10
11

schools and churches should have been considered enough to
let them put it in the park?
A

Mo, Your Honor, I'm suggesting that you have to

12

weigh the social values that are inherent in the disruption and

13

dislocation of individuals and industries when you consider

14

whether to put a road through a park or to put a road in an

15

alternate toute.

16

On page 15 of our brief v/e set forth the Senate Committee

17

report which is part of the legislative history and it states

IS

specifically, and 1 quote, that"there are other high priority

19

items which must be weighed in the balance. . The Committee is

20

extremely concerned that the highway program be carried out.

21

in such a manner as to reduce in all instances the harsh impact

22

on people which results from the dislocation and displacement

23

by reason of highway construction”.

24

Q.

What did it say hboufc the displacement of parks?

25

A

”■

go on to say that the use of parklands

29

1

properly protected with damage minimised with the most sophis-

2

ticafced construction techniques is to be preferred to the

3

movement of -large numbers of prople»

4
5

That was the intent of Congress in the legislative his­
tory of the act,

6

0.

Does anything in the act indicate that?

7

A.

In the act itself?

S

Q.

Indicatas that standard?

9

A.

Well, the Congress indicated it in the legislative

10

history , Your Honor» The specific language says that they

n

shall not approve a park route unless there are no other pru­

12

dent and feasible alternatives»

13

And the question before this Court is whether that was

14

considered. Whether the determination was made. And we submit

15

that itss undisputed on this record that the determination—~

16

Q,

Was it made and supported, or just made?

17

A.

Well, Your Honor, that goes to the arbitrary and

18

capricious standard, or the standard of review, that is to be

19

exercised in determining the Secretarys determination»

£0

Our position is that it is the Secretarys form to make

21

the determination

22

was arbitrary and capricious»

23
24
25

0.

and this Court is to then decide whether tha-:

Can we do that without the record? The records from

the transpotation?
A

Without the administrative record?
30

&

Yes .

R.

Your Honore X believe that on a summary judgement

motion if there are no facts submitted to dispute or to indicate
a dispusive expression that it is proper to determine that the
Secretary did not violate that reviewing standard.
That is all that is required in a summary judgement mo­
tion «

1C

&

Suppose we found that we needed it, could we get it?

L

The administrative record is not part of the record

in this case, No. Your Honor.

11
12

&

Well, is it available?

L

Weil, it is available, it was in the Department of

13

Transportation, it was shown to Petitioners Counsel and he

14

examined the administrative record and saw the entire record

IS

on which the Secretary based his opinion.

16

Now, there is an allegation made that there were additional

17

aocuments, in Tennessee. And that is very well true, but they

IS

sxd not, they were not considered by the Secretary and fcheyre

19

10t £ormed Part

20

retary based his decision.

All you have on that is the statement of the Secra-

A

You have the statement of the Secretary that the

viterminations were indeed made and you have the affadavihs show

25

nggthe oafferent reasons why altermate routes ®ere rejected.

31

1

2
3

Q.

Wall, again» is there any reason why the record is

not in the record?

A,

The reason„ Your Honor, is that it was decided below

4

on summary judgement motion on the basis of the affadavits and

S

no undisputed facts were introduced.
It was never more than just a report for the Court?

6
7

a.

I beg your pardon.

8

0.

The administrative record was never presented in "the

9
10

Court, was it?
a.

No, sir, it was not. But there was full access to it

n

for Petitioners Counsel had he wished to present it in order

12

to show in any way that the determination was not made pro­

13

perly .

14

0.

Well, Mr. Reynolds, how can I find otit the exact

15

time that, the red stripe with the two yellow stripes on both

16

sides? When was that decided upon?

17

A.

That v/as decided upon in 1968, April of 68 and that

18

is in the record, Your Honor. And the Petitioners recieved a

19

letter from the Secretary himself, which I quoted in part,

20

telling them at that time that the determination had made that

2!

the route would run through Overton Park.

22
23
24
25

Q.

And by the time that the land was cleared, the only

feasible route was through the park?
A.

In November of 1969, when the design was approved,

that is correct. The land had been cleared to the edge of the
32

j

I

park on both sides.

2

Q.

And so that8s the end.

3

A

I beg your pardon.

4

&

That's the end?

5

A.

Of what? The route was established in 1968.

6

Q.

But what's the feasible route on that map? As it now

7

stands, other than to go through the park?
A.

8
9

to i],o through the park.
Q.

10

II

There is no feasible and prudent route. Other than

So then* in that case, the moving party here has no

possibility of redress.
A

12

The moving party here, Your Honor, has not suggested

13

any issue here which would warrant a grant of Certiorari by

14

this Court.

When were the contracts, or have the contracts for

this construction been let?

A.

Yes, sir, the contract was let.

ARGUMENT OF MR. J. ALAN HANOVER, ESQ.

Thank You, Mr. Reynolds. Mr.

6
1
8
9

Hanover?

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. HANOVER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the
Court.
On behalf of the state of Tennessee I think that I might

10

for a momend digress and help answer some factual questions,

11

that members of the Court have asked, which are very difficult

52

for Mr. Reynolds to answer, he not having had an opportunity

13

to see the park.

H

In answer to the question a moment ago as to how many

15

parks are in Memphis, the record shows that the city of Memphis

16

at the present time has some 4700 acres of parka within its

17

borders. We are talking, of course, about 26 acres out of a

18

340 or 50 acre park. It should he pointed out to the Court

59

that the zoo has always been a separate entity from the park

20

itself.

21

Q.

22

your point.

23

A

24
25

Mr. Hanover, don't get tooofar away from making

Yes, sit. If I may have the pointer, I might possibly

do both at the same time.
Nov? the zoo has always been a separate entity from the
35

1

JLarl. It has always been severed historically for over 50 or

z

60 years by this bus route which many years ago was a street

3

carrrouta and formerly a little aaarrc®* g^age railroad.

4

The only

entrance to the soo from the south nas always

5

been at this point and will be continued by means of a pedes­

6

trian walkway over the depressed area of the expressway.

7

"Basically, the position of the state of Tennessee is

8

that we should not be stayed, not by any reason of any eleventh

9

amendment issue which we have not raised and did not intend to

10

claim sovereignty immunity. I feel in Mr. Vardamans brief he

11

possibly misunderstood something I said in my brief.

12

The state feels it has a vital interest in this case, not

13

only from a coat standpoint, but from a diity to its citizens

14

delay future safety maintenance of this road. The state does

15

not feel that it should be stayed, for the reason that there

16

are no constitutional issues in this case. The state of Tennes­

17

see in thiescase has not been accused of violating anyones

18

constitutional rights and the statute itself does not ruin to

19

the state of Tennessee.

20

it only places a burden on the Secretary of Transportation

21

the reason that we feel that way is because the state has 'ex­

22

pended and paid for the land in question and all of the land

23

to each side of the park, and that connection, I should point

24

out to the Court, that this east-west expressway is approximat­

25

ely twelve miles long. It extends from the eastern edge of the
36

?

city to the Missippt

2

as being the western boundary of the town.

River which has been correctly stated

3

Ql

You mean twelve miles through the city?

4

k

Yes, sir. It is the only present planned method of

5

bringing traffic from our downtown area, which is on the west­

6

ern edge rather than is centrally loeeted as in most citifes,

7

to the eastern heavy residential areas.

8

9

Now. Uhe state has purchased this and it's our belief that
the state should be the master of its own destiny in a Federal

10

aid situation that if the route should ever be changed, if

11

changes should be made which either caused delay or cost which

12

the state may not %*ish to participate in, it's going to be left

with tMs two million dollar expenditure, which we may or may

not get back from the Department of Transportation.

state, prior to the passage of the new

37

■1

law* acquired right of way?

2

A

Had acquired right of way. Your Honor* oh -the eastern

3

and western edged leading up to this» These last two segments

4

were the last bringing it to—

5

Q.

And had they acquired the route through the park* the

right of way through the park? Prior to the passage of the new

act?

SO
IS
12

A

No. That was acquired after Mr, Burrows letter* which

Mr, Reynolds read* 1 acquired that myself in negotiations wiHih
the city of Memphis—
Q.

But all the right of way outside the park had been—
A

Practically, At the time this lawsuit was filed one

13

year ago all but two parcels in this twelve mile stretch had

14

been acquired. Since that then* all has been acquired,

15

Q.

Had there been clearing of the right of way?

16

A

Yes* sir.

17

Q.

—prior to the passage of the new act?

18

A

Yes* sir* and construction in various segments on

each side.
Q.

How close to the park had clearing or construction

21

taken place?

22

A

23
24
25

Clearing or construction* Your Honrr prior to this

case had occurred in this general area within* I would estimate
o
s
a half mile or less of the park on each side.
Q.

But all the right of way had been acquired?
38

1

A

Yes, at the time this case was filed there were only

2.

one or two minor easements out of some 1700 parcels, the park

3

being one? hhat had not been acquired.

4

Q.

But we're speaking of the time as of the passage of

5

the new act.

8

A

I would estimate at that time, Your Honor, that that

7

part is not in the record, from either side, I would estimate

8

based on personal experience that I would say two thirds to thr^e

3

fourths had been acquired by 1968.

io

0.

You think the act applies?

n

A

I think the act applies, Your Honor, in this sit­

12

uation, only to the question as to whether all possible things

13

had been dorxt to minimize harm to the park.

14

IS

I think the route question was settled by the passage of
the act.

16

0.

17

of the act?

18

A

No, sir.

19

0.

You agree that Congress has the power in passing on

You raise any question as to the constitutionality

20

these things to pass a law which says city parks are not to

21

be taked except under certain standards?

22

A

Yes, sir. I agree with that. I just don’t think

23

this particular act applies to the state of Tennessee. I thinl

24

it on;y applies to the Secretary of Transportation.

25

0,

Well do you think it applies to this highway?
33

A.

I do»

Q.

Well, what difference does rt make if it applies to

the state of Tennessee if it applies to the highway?
h

Well, I think that the difference is, Your HOnor,

that it affects whether or not the Secretary can grant federal
aid, I don't think it affects a states right to build a highway which it feels it needs through a park without federal
aid»
Q.

Going back to a question that was put earlier to

someone» Would you say that if the state of Tennessee were
building this entire highway that there would be any federal
jurisdiction, at all?
A.

You mean, the entire I 40?

Q.

All of it»

A,

I would say that there would not be. The point is,

Your Honor, that it's done and approved in sections» The state
never knows until its completed whether or not the £ederal
aid will be forthcoming» It's more in the nature of a unilateral
contract, which the federal government ways if you build this
road in a certain way, we will pay our portion» There’s no
requirement that the state build it, the federal government
cannot make them build it, and when you get through they may
say you havensr complied with our standard, we won;t pjty you»
Q.

Is it 90% coverage?

A.

Yes, sir.
40

(X

Well, what if you lost this case, would you say that

the federal government would only be prevented from contributing
to the construction of the highway through the park?

A

That-s correct» That's our position, YOur Honor,

that the state should then have -the right to---

6

Q.

Just through the park»

7

A

To evaluate his position. It may wish to do that

8

anyway, it’s always been the states position even before the

9

road4 reached the end that that was the only psudent and feas­

10

ible alternative for the city of Memphis. It’s traffic patterns

11

and various other things that should be coxisidered in the build-'

12

ing of this road.

13

Q.

14

part south?

15

A

18

Ql

On the map, is the top part north, and the bottom

Yes, sir.
Right west and left east.

Yes sir. This is east.

Ql

22

A

23
24

25

The width of the city at this point?
Yes.
I would estimate, Your Honor, that that’s about 4

to 5 miles to the center of the city.
Ql

And of course, I’m not tailing about what's feasible,

I donjt know what's a feasible alternative—

41

1

Q.

-““but I presume that that place is like many others

z

could be entered either from the northern part or the southern

3

part and go astound the edges and not interfere at all with

4

all these churches.

5

A.

Well, the only problem with that, Your Honor, is that

S

on three sides of the park* where X'm pointing are three of the

7

largest thoroughfares in the city, which of course handle

8

great volumes of traffic*--"

9
10

n

Q.

But they9re already there. There's no problem vzith

them.

..
A.

No sir, and the point is that it would affect I°m

12

sure engineering wise,

13

away with some other thoroughfare in the building of it. You

14

would just be cancelling out what you're doing.

15

(X

X woul

the use of the expressway if you did

assume that the highway built across the

16

northern part or , jsilt across the southern part as far a time

17

is concerned, there would be no advantage to putting it through

18

the park, would there?

m

A,

Well, X don *t think it would take any longer to con­

20

struct, the problem is that all of these people are already

21

moved and the houses are already torn down and the state owns

22

all of this right of way. The only other point that we wish to

23

call the Courts attention is that in the event that this Court

24

does feel that a stay is proper, the state feels that it is a

25

proper case foa some security. We realise, of course, that sec-

AO

1

urifcy is a matter of discretion with this Court, but the state

2

has been stayed off and on in this matter for over a year»

3

They originally had a letting plan last November of 1969,

4

and because of a stay order issued by the District Court, the

5

state has not been able to do anything until the Sixth Circuit

6

Court of Appeals released the injunction. At that time the

7

state did move ahead promptly, in view of the fact that this

8

road has been in progress for almost 15 years, and did let a

9

contract.

10

We gave that information to the Court so the Court could

n

see how rising costs have affected the State. I do not agree

12

with the agruments presented that it would hurt the Petitioners

13

or deny them any rights.

14

0.

Do you agree with their position or do you consent

15

to their position? That if the Court takes the case that it

16

shou3.d decide it on this argument, that there's enough evidence

17

to decide it?

18

A

We do not object to that, Your HOnor. I would feed,

19

on behalf of the state, that we should be given the opportunity

20

to file soma additional briefs within a very short period of

21

tiee. If the Court chose to do that, since we did not cover

22

all of those issues-- -

23
24

25

Q.

That would be better, you think, to let it take its

matural course?

A.

Well, Your Honor, naturally a delay is something that

43

1

we’ve been fighting for some time# or that I’ve been fighting

2

for aome time, and we do want to expedite it, although we do

3

feel that the state is entitled, and the Commissioner, too,

4

i mean, they could be damaged heavily without security»

3

0.

What kind of security do you think you'd want?

©

A.

I think they should post a bond, Your Honor»

7
8
9

.

Q.

How much?

A.

1 would estimate, again Your Honor, this is based

on knowledge that I'm not fully aware of on time, as to how

10

long it would take, but I would estimate a bond from anywhere

II

in the neighborhood of 250,000 dollars to 500,000 dollars

12

would be sufficient, rather than a multi-million dollar bond

13

that Counsel for the Petitioner seems to think we’re requiring»

14

Q.

What kind of loss whold you suffer?

15

A.

We will suffer, as we already have in the past year,

16

the bid, the proposed bid by the same low bidder a year age

17

was 613,000 dollars less than it is today» So in the last year

13

conss for building this identical engineering design have risen

19

613,000 dollars»

20

Q.

It's not based on the fact that you bought this land,

21

is it? I would assume that in the middle of Memphis, if that

22

is in the middle of Memphis, the land would be worth just as

23

much if not more than it it now when they get through with it.

24
25

A.

I don't know what the state could do with it, Your

Honor» The city has already spent most of the money-—
44

1

Q.

2

&

They could sell the land, couldn't they--Well, we might, I hate to be facetious, but I don’t

3

know what the city could do with this 26 acre strip of land

4

in the park. I’m sure we couldn’t get the money back from the

S

city.

6

Q.

That's right in the park—--

X

Yes sir.

I was talking about the approaches to the park.

The houses and so on.

The houses are gone. They've all been—that land has

Q.

You're reminded of the affadavit of Mr. J.B. Michael

15

Who was awarded the contract.

The federal governmenr-Ninety percent of it?
Yes, sir. I think the bond should run to both, and I

think both parties need being protected, not fust the state.
Q.

The federal government hasn’t asked for that.
45

A.

\

Of course we have no guarantee either, Your Honor,

2

that when it’s over with that for soma other reason they may

3

deny federal---

4

0.

They may what?

5

A.

We have no reason to know at this time when the road

6

is completed this way that for some other reason the Department

7

may say we're not going to pay federal aid. They may feel that

8

we have not handled something else in a proper manner. Which

9

often happens.
They have that right to withold that aic! until the state

10

11

has completed the project and expended their funds and has

i2

shown the Department that they have done everything to the

13

requirements.
Q.

14

You would agree, I suppose that so far as the Con­

15

Is the road now running through the park?

The city of Memphis mow maintains a non-access

concrete diesel bus route, which runs roughly, Your Honor, from

13

the center of where this right of way is now going, It’s now—

14

the pavement itself is 25 - 30 feet wide and has a cleared

15

right of way ef, say, 40 - 50 feet wide. And the route pro­

16

poses to stay on that. That's the reason that this jog was

17

made instead of coming straight across in the first place,

13

was to stay on the natural separation that the park has always

19

had and to avoid any damage to the park proper. That’s the

20

very reason it was designed to follow this very slightly raised

21

route as it came forth through the park, to stay with that

FURTHER ARGUMENT OF JOHN W. VARDAMAN, JR.ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

3

MR. VARDAMANt Yes, Your Honor, just a few---

4

Q.

Excuse me, Mr. Vardaman, excuse me-- Justice Harlan—

5

0.

I wanted to supplement the question that has been

6

asked by Mr. Justice Black. Have you any objection to having

7

this case decided on the merits of these papers? Do you

8

need to put in further stuff that you want?

9

fl,

By the merits, you mean decide the petition question?

10

0,

Yes.

11

R.

Let me just say I dp. hot have any problem on that You*

12

Honor, however, the application for stay did not raise as one

13

of the issues to be presented to this Court the question as

14

to whether the arbitrary and capricious standars should be ap­

15

plied. Or the substantial evidence standard should be applied.

10

And that issue was briefed in their brief which we did not

17

have the benefit of seeing before we submitted our brief. 7.

18

believe that we would like, if the Court feels that that might

19

be one of the issues that they would want to grant the Certio-

20

riai on, I believe we would like to have an opportunity to

2!

brief thatopoint.

22

Unless I could speak to it now.

23

0.

At the moment we're two steps prior to whether it

24

would be decided on the merits. We have before us now an appli­

that Certiorari has been granted in this case* and have—

No* Your Honor-

I didn’t think you did—

—he would be willing to have—

16

Q.

My question was intended to be.

17

A.

I'm sorry. I thought you meant would we be willing

18

to have our brief treated as in opposition to what is proposed

19

I believe is a Petition for Certiorari* and thet is their brief

20

and my answer to that question is the one I gave. Right. I

2!

son't believe we would be willing to do the other.

22

0,

Not willing. You answer his question "no”,

23

&

His question as to the brief on the merits* yes* Your

24

Honor. That answer is no. We would be willing to have it freatec

25

as in opposition to a Petition for Certiorari. Except with the

49

I
2
3

one reservation that I mentioned.
If that is decided—
Q.

You say we could treat this as a Petition for Cer­

4

tiorari, If we granted it, I take it from your answer that you

5

would prefer the briefing and arguments and delay to an immed­

6

iate decision on the merits now.

7

If we granted it, there wauld probably be a stay.

8

A

If it were granted, Your Honor—

9

Q.

You'd rather have the grant and the stay and the op­

10
11

portunity to argue than the decision now?
A

If it were granted and there were a stay, I wou

pre­

12

fer to have an opportunity to brief the merits, I would agree

13

to an expedited schedule in accordance with the suggestion of

14

this dourt, but I do believe that if we get to that stage that

15

at that point we would want an opportunity to brief the raetits,

16
17
18
19

20
21

22

Q.

Oh, yes, yes, but you don't think you'd brief the

merits, sufficiently for your purposes at this point?
A

We have introduced ourselves only to the question

of whether this Court should grant Certiorari,
Q.

So your answer is that you have some licks you want tc

get in before the Court decides the merits?
A

I may well, Your Honor. I would like to have time

23

to consider the question as to the , what additonal information

24

on the merits and I qould agree to an expedited briefing sched­

25

ule if it would get to that stage, but I believe at the prestnfc

7

sition of the right of way seems to be based upon the premise

8

that this act was passed in 1968* and it was done before it

S

was passed, but that's incorrect.

10

The statute was first passed in 1966/ and the right of

11

way acquisition began in 1967. So the acquisition of the right o

12

of way began after the statute was passed.

13

Further, in the press release that was put out. in 196$,

14

it contains the following statement;"Much of the right of way

15

leading up to the park already has been purchased."

16

0-

What was the date of the enactment of the provision

that required the Secretary to make this specific finding that

18

you're arguing about?
The provision was enacted in 1966. Section 4F of the

19

20
2!

22
23

Department of Tra.nsporti.tion.
Q,

Which says that, and since 1966 he's had to make this

finding?
JL

Now the statute doesn't say specifically he shall

24

make the finding. It says he shall not approve the project

25

unless there's no prudent

51

0.

And that law has been on the b<f>ibks since 1966?

2

A.

Yes* Your Honor,

3

tod they say now that the route was approved in 1968, but

4

the right of way acquisition began in 1967 and by 1968 ranch

3

of it had been acquired. So they acquired the right of way

6

before they approved the project and we shouldn’t be made to

7

bear the burden .of that rather precipitous acttion. Instead

a

we suggest that what they have done by purchasing that right of

©

way before making the decision is to present themselvea and the

fO

Court with a fait accompli which shouldn’t be permitted.

The Court should review Ms decision.

purchasers desires.

All the way back to where that line is?

21

A

I8m not clear, Your Honor. This map, of course is

not part of the record in this case, and I’m not sure what

23

these various lines are, but we would go back to approximately

I think the houses have been torn down all the way up to the

order.

3

Q.

One point seven miles?

4

A,

One point seven miles, I believe. But the reason

S

those houses are torn down is because all of this activity took

6

place before they made the final decision on this project and

7

before the statutes on which We rely were actually pulled into

a

pley, because you had to have a final decision from the seg­

9

ment involving the park before these statutes came into play

before we had a cause of action.

On the other side of th «park they were very expensive homes

20

that were torn down.

21

22

Ql

Do you know the total cost to the city in acquiring

that right of way?

23

A,

NO----

24

Is it in the

§.

record?

X don't believe that's in the record, but the cost
54

i
2

of. acquiring the right of way in -the park is in the record,
and 1 think that8s 2.2 million dollars, but I don't think

3

it's in the record what it cost to acquire what’s outside the

4

park--™

5

Q.

Two million is what the state paid the city?

6

It

That’s correct., and 1 don't-—

7

(X

That would be a reimbursement from the federal gov-

8

ernmenr—

9

&

Yes, sir, -chat’s correct.

10

Ql

Were you given access to the administrative record,

11
12

the administraviva files, Mr. Vardanian, as the government claims
A.

Not to my understanding. Your Honor, I was led to

13

beleive that based on a representation of a document of a mo­

14

tion for change of venue filed in the United States District

15

Court in the District of Columbia that the bulk of the rele­

16

vant documents were in Tennessee. That's Why the government

17

sought to change venue. I

18

I was, on an afternoon, two days before a preliminary

19

injunction motion allowed to examine the file, in preparation

20

for that preliminary injunctionmmotion which 1 understood dod

2!

not constituta anywhere near the number of relevant documents

22

in this case.

23

At no time, to my recollection, was I told that this was

24

the administrative record on which the Secretary acted. I

25

think, furthermore, the question of tehat the administrative

55

1

record is is a legal question but I was at no time told that

2

this was the record on which he acted,

3
4

Q.

This is the controversy surrounding page 13 of the

government

5

A.

That's correct»

6

Q.

brief?

7

a.

That's correct. And I might add that the document which

8

we did take from that file and put in the record in this case

©

is a document which had not been submitted by Mr. Sweight.

10

That's the document which shows that the alternative to

n

the north actually takes more residencies, displaces, or ad™

12

versely affects more people than the route which goes through

13

the park.

14

And they characterise that route as taking Southwestern

15

University. As you can see from here it goes past what looks

16

to be a grand front lawn of Southwestern.

17

Q.

Suppose you prevail irf getting your stay and also in

18

having your writ granted. What ultimate relief do you ultimately

19

concieve this Court that you'd be entitled to from this Court?

20

JL

Your Honor, I think that the appropriate relief would

21

be that suggested by Judge Celebrezze. That this should be re­

22

manded to the District Court to be treated as a mandamous action

23

and

24

ment on the record as to

25

the District Court could then review. That’s one alternative,

remanded to the Secretary to have him make a formal state­
what decisions ha made and why which

56

1

otherwise the Court could simply reverse and enter an injunction

2

and 1 assume that if the Secretary wanted to he could come back

3

and-—

4

0=

5
6

But you dont contemplate a reopening of the proeedings

for the introduction of new evidence?
A

Oh, I certainly would Your Honor» I would suggest that

7

if we were back that the summary judgement would be reversed

8

and when we were back in the District Court we would be entitled

9

to whatever type of a trial that we were entitled to initially»

10
11

Ql

Would it be a trial in which alternatives other than

those marked on there could be considered, in your judgement?

12

A.

Yes, I think it should be, Your Honor,

13

Ql

Do you think this h rpofehetical process is complicated

14

by the fact that the Secretary who made these decisions is no

15

longer the Secretary?

16

A,

Your Honor, it is undoubtedly complicated somewhat by

17

that but that is one of the reasons that it is necessary to

18

impose upon you. The people who make these decisions, Mie re­

19

quirement that they be incorporated in some type of written or­

20

der so that as the administrations change whatever was decided

2!

will be recorded there»

22

Q.

Congress could easily have provided that, could they

23

not? As they do in many other situations? Administrative sit­

24

uations?

25

A

They certainly could have»
57

1

Q,

E

Q,

But they didn't»

A,

However, the fact -that they didn't I think should

3

not be regarded, that the silence of Congress should be regarded

4

as permission not to do it. Particularly where Congress has

5

made these actions specifically rebuttable, by the Courts

6

under the administrative procedure.

7

I would note that the people who did make the original

8

decisions, or the decisions in 1968 are available to testify

9

and they are willing to testify

10

that under the decision below

we are not permitted to ask them what decisions they made.

1-1

That's another reason

12

0.

suggest the decision below—-

Mr. Vardaman, there's a section that you've been

13

arguing about. The federal Aid Highway Act. It says after the

14

effective date of the Federal Aid Highway Actof 1968 the

15

Secretary shall not approve any programs.

'16

A

That's a correct statement o£ section 138 of the

17

Federal Aid Highway Act,. Now if Your Honor woudl examine what

18

section 4F of the Department of Trandpor.tation Act, not as it

10

presently appears, as it appeared when enacted in 1966.

20

The operative provisions are verbatim for the--

21

Q.

You cant say after the effective date of the Fed­

eral Aid Highway Act?

22
23

&

No. I think that the provisions which we're discussing

shall not approve unless there are no feasible—-

24
25

Q.

Shall not approve what, highways—

Q.

Well, do you think that if the Federal Aid Highway

Act had never been passed you would still be here on the same
case?
A

Under'the Department of Transportation Act.

Q.

And you don't think the Federal Aid Highway Act

superceded that and gave a new date for——
A

No, Your Honorc Let rae explain just briefly the

way the act was passed»
There was at one time, when the Department of Transpor­

12

tation Act was passed, section 4F was repealed. And it said

13

the Secretary shall not approve any project unless there are

14

no feasible and prudent alternatives.

IS

Unless the design includes all possible design and planning

16

to minimise harm. There was at that time a section 138 in the

17

Federal Aid Highway Act that was slightly different.

?8

In 1968 it was decided to make those identical, and there

19

was an amendment in 1968 but the requirements concerning feas­

20

ible and prudent alternatives, and the requirements concerning

21

all possible planning in the 1966 act were applicable to this

22

case and indeed the Department of Transportation considered

23

them applicable to this case.

24
25

Mr. Bridwell testified before Congress on one occassion
concerning differnet aspects of this case and he said section
59

i

4F came into play. So it was the Departments interpretation of

2

the Act as well as ours.

3

Q,

Does this highway connect, or run through the city?

4

Connect on the east end with a through highway and a cross

5

country highway—

6

A

Yes, Your Honor.

7

Q,

What number is that?

a

A

9

io

This is I 40. It's a transcontinental highway and

as 1 understand it goes—
Q.

As far a4i that highway is concerned it’s a question

11

of how long does ft take to get through the city, isn't it,

12

and not haw to get there.

13

A

Well, I’m not even sure that that's the question in

14

that particular case, Your Honor, because there are people trav­

15

eling on an interstate who are traveling interstate. They don't

16

have fro go on this highway. There's under construction now a

17

circumferential which will go—
Such as we have here.

13
19

A

I think it's located closer in, but basically the idea

20

is the same. So that those who are traveling through would be

21

able to go on the circumferential and aviod going downtown.

22

I think that's the way those people--

Who started, who offered this bill, this amendment

that provides for this—
A -

Senator Yarborough from Texas did. This—60

■-

3

Q.

Was any movement, any widespread movement behind it?

Or do you know?
A

At that time, 1 think this was one of the first bills

4

which was passed to articulate a purpose and to begin a pro­

5

gram of environmental protection» That movement has been buildinjg

6

up over the years since 1966 and now there is wide support for

7

this bill and every other type of bill. Practically every

8

other type.

9

Ql

To protect the parks?

10

A

To protect the parks, to protect recreation areas,

si
12

to protect out natural resources.
&

Did I understand you to 3ay, in answer to a question

13

by Mr. Justice Black that if you prevail in this case and the

14

summary judgement is set aside and the case is remanded to the

15

District Court then it will be up to the District Court to con­

!@

sider and weigh the various alternative routes?

S7

A

Wo. I didn't mean to say that. What I meant to say is

18

that in passing on the Seeretarys judgement the District Court

19

may determine whether he applied the statute incorrectly in

20

not choosing other alternatives.

21
22

Q.

In ©hher wouds the questionwwill be whether or not the

Secretary complied with the statute?

23

A

That's correct.

24

Q.

That's not up to the District Courts surely—

25

A -

Ohf no, 1 agree with Your Honor. Wo, it’s not up to

the District Courts,

I wanted to be sure I understood you.

No. The Question will be whether he complied with the

statute. Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Vardanian, Mr. Reynolds, Mr, Han dvr.
