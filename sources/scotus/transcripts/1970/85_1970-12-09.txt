I feel that in fair­

ness- to the petitioner# that the Court keep in mind exactly
what this young man has become and was at the time that he facec
his draft board on the examination for the qualifications for
cons cientious obj ector„

15
This young man had graduated from high school and

IQ

went to Texas to become a cowboy right after his graduation.
17

After returning from Texas he attended a school* The Neighbor­
18

hood Playhouse School in New York City for two years and he was
19

granted a deferment * 2S deferment as a student for those two
20

years.

Before that he was classified 1-A,

■ In the spring of 1967 he felt called upon to write

— in March, of 1364 —, in his classification questionnaire he

had not made any claim for being a conscientious objector.

MR. LYNN:

Pag© 3 of the Petitioner's brief.

Thank you.
"X am requesting the classification of

12

conscientious objector on. the basis of -the following reasons:

13

(1) I believe that the United States Government is using all

14

the brutal instruments of modern war against a poor peasant

15

population which simply claims the right to have a government

16

of its own free choice? (2) I object to any assignment in the

17

United States Armed Forcers while this unnecessary .and unjust

10

war is being waged, on the grounds of religious belief?

19

specifically: humanism.

2,0

respect for man, -faith .ini hi©, inherent goodness and perfecta-*

21

bility and confidence in his capability to improve some of the

22

pains of the human condition.”

23
24
25

This, essentially, means love and

Thereafter he was sent the Form 150 and he filled it
out and when it came to the question of whether he was
*
religious, he wrote in his forms “Religion to me means the
3

f

devotion of man to the highest ideal that he can conceive„

2

respect for the dignity and race of every human being and the

3

capacity to enter into decent and just and lovely relations

4

with other human beings is not dependent upon being a member of

5

a specific religious

6

A

sect or organisation."

Now, as I understand from the brief of the Solicitor

7

General, there is no.issue being made as to whether this young

8

man is religious under the Seeger and Welsh cases.

9

that that is not in dispute.

1©

I think

And the question of sincerity, if it please the

U

Court, was not disputed? it was — Judge Wyatt who was 'the trial

12

judge in the Southern District Court in New York, he said,

13

"Aside from the question of sincerity."

14

for the Second Circuit also did not question the sincerity.

15

There was no specific statement from either courts '”We believe

16

this young man to be sincere."

17

the mind of the court, as it did not seem to be an issue in the

IS

minds of the draft board,' because the draft board simply said

IS

that "This registrant seems to derive his objection to. the war

20

mainly from the Vietnam War."

21

draft board said, and that, is on page 11? page 1.1 of the

22

Appendix — the joint appendix here, at the bottom of the page.

23

It was simply not an issue in

The main source ©£ information which brought «about these

That means that he does not want to foreclose

I think it was an attempt to be as

I recall very well. Your Honor,- when we used to be

addressed by Norman Thomas, the Socialist candidate for

6

President, who was an absolute pacifist during the wars and he

7

was against all wars, as he made very plain and he was very

8

active in the movement against all wars.

Norman Thomas gave what he called "constructive support" to
the war.
In other words/ I believe, and I don3t think anyone

But when the second

ever questioned his sincerity — between the two world wars',
that he was absolutely opposed to all war; he was an absolute
pacifist

and. even when he was questioned and with the advent

of Hitler to power he sail that he thought that he should be
resisted with passive resistance.
But, nevertheless, when the United States of America
was attacked at Pearl Harbor there was something
he was an American citizen.

also in him;

And he said then, "I will have to

change my mind," and he gave constructive support to .

war.

He was honest each time but there were different occasions
which greatly moved him.--

. -

■

.

.= .

And so this young man, just &s the young man in the
Sisson case, as Judge ttfysansky pointed outs he was being as
6

1

honest as he could be at this time when he's being questioned.

2

He's sure ©f what he's saving and what he believes at this

3

point.

4

if it were attacked because he could not fo@ certain of what

5

would happen to him in that contingency.

And therefore, he said, SSX might defend the country

6
7

And 1 submit that that does not derogate from the
sincerity of his conviction of being opposed to' the war.

8

How, X say further that when h@ was questioned, as

9

it comes out in further questioning, that he would defend his

10

family or defend himself from attacki

n

every means necessary» defend from attack,,

12

tions -that had been recognised because it is true -that an

m

absolute pacifist does not resist at all? an absolute pacifist

14

does not resist at all, contrary to the statement on page; 16

IS

of the Government's answering brief, which says that "The

16

Congress has gecognissad conscientious objection as a basis for

17

exemption — at the top of page 16 — from military service has

18

it extended the privilege to persons other than those who were

19

total pacifists■— pardon me,

20

at the end;

21

‘he would defend it by
‘These are. excep­

X need to go back on page 15

"Never in all the years' in which Congress has

22

recognised conscientious objection as a basis for exemption frorr

23

military service has it extended the privilege to persons other

24

than those who were total pacifists? that is: opposed to all

25

forms of war,"

7

Now, that is not altogether accurate, of course,

1

2

because the exception of the proviso that "I would defend my­

3

self? I would.defend my friends? I would defend those close to

4

me,M has not been considered to prevent a person from being

5

considered a conscientious objector.

@

Court is well aware, in the whole line of

7

Jehovah's Witnesses, culminating in the Sicurella case, this

a

exception on the part of the Jehovah’s Witnesses, who have

9

written tracts that they publish — they published a tract in

11
12

13
14
15
16
17
18

19
20
21

And of course, as the
'cases involving

1951 and they are published in Wafeehguard, I think — Watchtower — they published an article saying, "Why we are not
pacifists," And the Court in Sicurella handled that fay coming
to the conclusion that the Jehovah * s Witnesses were not really
concerned with & war.

They sale. "We are ready for a war that

is God-ordained? that our Jehovah sets that we should partici­
pate in.

We sure ready for that war."

When they said that they

don't-mean a real war on earth.
However, there are other authorities? Beyton(ph) for
example, who said that -the Jehovah's Witness might very well
have considered that the first World War was one where the antiChrist was involved? the German Kaiser, and therefore they might
very well — I don't personally know what the position of the
Jehovah's Witnesses was in the First World War, but it is this;
the Jehovah's Witnesses would not fight in any war if they felt
that a war were ordained — a war right on earth and as
8

1

all the Justices know, ffiany of the .-most.' .bitter wars have been

2

religious wars»

3

So that when you exempt people who are, in favor of

4

a war that conforms with their religion then you are making a

5

very major exemption and so therefore we have here the germ ©f

0

the approach to saw the statute.

Because, as I see it, the

Court has a choice in this argument ©f saving the statute by
interpreting it as it was interpreted for one way, in the Taffs
case, where the Court, a Court of Appeals in the 8th Circuit
felt that whan the statute said, "participation in war in any
form," it was talking about a modification of participation in
any form of participation that was perhaps & semantic way of
dealing with the problem but they did have this question, this
logical question, that there ara exceptions for a parson not
being willing to engage in violent conduct ancl yet he is quali­
fied as a conscientious objector.
The Court has had this problem,'of course, before
with this same statute.

The law does read very clearly that a

person by reason of religious training and b&Xi&L

qualifies

as a coBSci@nti.oua objector and originally the statute said
also that' the touchstone' was whether the person believed in a

21

22
23

24

supreme being.
Now, of course, in the Seeger case the Court inter­
preted that statute in .accordance, I submit, with .the contem­
porary understanding of religion in large sections of. the

23

population,

We know of many sincere and religiously motivated

persons no longer believe in the ~~.G©d, and yet they are
stirred by til© religious impulses and therefore, in S eager *
this Court recognized that and they, in the Welsh case, which
was even further ahead, and the Welsh.case went so far as to
say, and that is germane here

that even if a person, as a part

©f his moral stance, had taken into account political problems
as Welsh had very much so, and economic problems, and the social
destiny of the country, even though this was a part.

And -the

statute said that merely philosophical, social, political

I!

beliefs cannot be a part of this religious feeling, nonetheless;

12

the Court pointed out, and I think very logically, and in

13

accordance with reality, that vary often the political and

economic and social feelings of a person contributes to his

total moral positions: that cor a of conscience which is suprema

that is not an issue? that it is virtually conceded that Mr.

Gillette's opposition to the

Asia, is supported by religious training and belief.

3

what's going on in Southeast

The only question is, since he has not indicated an

4

all-out opposition to all wars, whether or not the statute —

5

if not the statute, than the constitution — requires that he

be exempted along, with those whose opposition, religious opposi­

Isn't that really what the issue is?

That's the issue.

And, Your Honor, if the

Court feels that the statute could not bear an interpretation

10

that this major emphasis, as I see Mr. Gillette's position, the

adopted .by Judge Douglas, in writing the majority opinion in

And that position,' I think, was later

and where this person had said that he could not

24

would have "to determine whether he could take, and of course,

Imd was 2 correct in understanding that there

is no issue here as to the fact that his conscientious objectior ,■
13
quit® apart from the scope of it, is statutorily supported;
14
that is: is based upon his religious training and belief as
15
feat statutory phrase was construed in. the See gar ease?
16

There is no contention that his beliefs here

17
are not religiously based* as feat word was adumbrated in the

Of course I do not seek to resolve that difference, ex­

of four Justices on grounds of statutory construction and in the

case of the fifth Judge on what I think must be said to be

This ease was tried before Judge Wyatt with a jury.
It led to a verdict of guilty.

The only issue which Judge

Wyatt submitted to the jury was the question of whether he
willfully failed to comply with an order to report for induc­
tion and the issue before the Court of Appeals and before this
Court is whether Judge Wyatt made any errors of lav? in connec­
tion with the conduct of the trial leading up to that submis­
sion to the jury' and the only error of law which is suggested,,
relates to this question of selective consciencious objection,
which is embodied in that ruling of Judge Wyatt's which appears

And next we have the history of provisions of this

sort.

14

Congress adopted a resolution to honor the consciences of those

15

who "from religious principles» cannot bear arms in any case."

16

And all of our early legislation on conscientious objections

17

was in terms of numbers of the historic peace churches: the

Quakers» the Mennonites and others, all of whom were opposed to

19

war in any circumstances.

ground of a conscientious objection to the undertaking of com­

batant service in the present war.

20

Senate? no changes have.since been made in the statute; it

21

continues to foe applicable to those who are opposed to partici­

22

pation in war in any form.

23

At the time of World War II, Senator ha toilette.

This was rejected by the

And then there are the' practicalities off the situa­

24

tion.

25

proposed in 1917, there was a great practical difference; a

As Congress saw when Senator La Pollette’s amendment was

23

1

difference in kind between opposition to participation in war

2

in any form and opposition to a particular war.

3

How particular

must the war be?

4

In World War II could a person have said that he was

5

opposed to the war in Europe and Africaf but not opposed to the

6

war in the Pacific on the ground that the Japanese had attacked

7

us but we hadn't been attacked in Europe and Africa?

8

we, on sincere religious grounds, have, said that he. was opposed

9

to air war because it affected civilians, but was not opposed

10

to ground war?

11
12

Q

Well, now, the question is: could he? Because

he obviously could, couldn't he?
A

13
14

Or could

-Could he successfully — could he have corns

within the language of “opposed to participation in war in any

'13

form,n and can it be practically determined hew sincerely ©r

IS

whether he really is sincera, particularly when the external

17

earmarks of conventional religion have been taken away from the

10

test.
Q

19

Well here 1 thought, to go back, that there

20

was absolutely no issue at all about the basis of his, this

21

man's opposition —

22

Q

Thera is no —

23

Q

So we're not dealing here with difficulties of

24
25

proof ~~
A

' X*ia talking about the question of construing

24

this statute as to whether the words "in any form" mean, shall
I say, "in any form?”

And I am suggesting that if they are

construed to mean something; other than that that the practical
questions which will be raised in other cases — not in this
case, but in other cases ■— will be very serious.
Congress is expressly given power byfche ConstitU“
tion to raise and support armies,/ but how it is possible to do
this a& a practical matter, since each man must be asked each
time he is ordered to a specific duty whether he is conscien­
tiously opposed to participation in this particular segment of
war.

And I don't say "of the war;" I say "of war."
In this connection it may be pointed out that it is

not possible to learn now

whether either the petitioner here

or the petitioner in the next case would ever be sent to
Vietnam if he should sea service in the Army.

Not all drafted

men, by any means, -are sent, to Vietnam; the country has many
other responsibilities throughout the world which require the
maintenance of large units of the armed forces in many eases:
in Germany and elsewhere in Europe; in Korea; in the Philippines
in Hawaii and many other bases in this country and the Arctic
and in the Mediterranean.

It is hard to see on what basis the

petitioners can claim exemptions from combatant or noacoiobat&nt
training when they would conscientiously accept some combatant
or noncombatant service.
And finally, there are a number of decisions which
25

1
2
3
4
5
6

7

construe the statutory language the way it reads.

the best known of these was that by the great Justice Augustus
Hand in his opinion in the United•States against Kauten, cited
on page 18 of our brief, where he said that a belief sufficient
to qualify for conscientious objector status must be a general
scruple, "against participation in war in any form” and not
merely an objection to participation in a particular war.
Now, this interpretation has been followed in a

8

number of cases.

There is also the well-known passage by Mr.

case quoting with approval from United States against Macintosh,

since the proper construction of the statute shows that Congress
has determined to limit the exemptions the remaining question
before the Court is whether this legislative judgment runs
afoul of some constitutional commands.

And we submit that it

does not.
Turning to the constitutional argument we note first

23
24

that the constitution, in simple but broad and unqualified terms,

26

This has

been broadly construed by this Court in the selected draft law

cases and more recently in Uni-ted States against O'Brien,.

Indeed* my principal concern about this case is fcha

‘1

lengths it may jeopardise the whole concept of the--e2seiapii©n

When there was* as there was for a long time* an

system is to administer it fairly? fairly to those who go, as

It needs to ba remembered that for every conscientious objector

If it becomes impossible to administer the system

That has to do, I think, with construing the

mention may be made of abortion, the death penalty, marijuana,

21

polygamy, divorce, vaccination, fluoridation and birth control.

22

These objections may be most sincerely held and based upon deep

religious teaching and conviction, or equally held conscientious

24

scruples.

that the objection is religious or deeply held does not give the

A contrary view would extend to the paying of taxes ,

to compliance wfcih laws for the education of children; to

7

health laws and many other aspects of our national life.

8

Indeed, it is not too much to say that to proceed very far down

9

that road leads to a form of anarchy where each person makes up

to

his own mind which of the laws established by the democratic

process he feels he can conscientiously comply with.

12

m

would undermine the integrity cf the democratic process.

And this

In allowing exemptions to those opposed, to war in

14
15

any form, Congress has successfully charted a course that pre­

16

serves the autonomy and freedom of religious bodies while

17

avoiding any semblance of established religion, as this Court

13

said last term in the Walsh case.
And finally, there is no

19

violation here of the

20

equal protection concepts which may be implicit, in the Due

21

Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, though that amendment

does not, itself, contain an equal protection clause in haec

As I have suggested, there is a qualitative difference between those who assert an unalterable "religious5’
