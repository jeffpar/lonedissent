ARGUMENT OF MR. RAMSEY CLARK, ESQ,

ON BEHALF OF GEORGE A, ROSENBLOOM,

PETITIONER
MR. CLARK: Mr. Chief Jus t-*oe*.? -nnd may it please the
Court.
This is a defamation suit brought under the laws of the

10

State of Pennsylvania, in the United States District Court,

11

jurisdiction being under diversity.

12

Before stating the facts, let me state the question,

13

briefly. New Youk Times v. Sullivan, of course, began to apply

14

the first amendment to the laws of defamation and liable whith

15

had interfered historically. It began in that area of conduct

16

of public officials, engaging in official conduct, and said

17

that only where actual malice can be shown can the state

18

statutes permitting recovery for defamantion apply. Otherwise

19

there will be a chilling effect,, There will foe inadequate breath

20

ing room for freedom•of speech.

I
21

The question here is whether that rule is to be extended
I

22

to the very private individual. To the two hundred million

23

Americans who are not famous, who are not public officials,

24

and who are not public figures sugh as Coach Butts or General

25

Edmund Walker. But just plain people engaging in ordinary life.

4

t

This petitioner,, George A. Roseiabloom, was a successful

z

salesman for the major magazine and hook distributor in the

3

United States. In that capacity in 1962 he was offered a major

4

■distributorship for American Outdoor Publishing Corporation,

§

which publishes midis-1' magazines. He carefully considered, be­

6

cause he was concerned as the record shows, about his repu­

7

tation, whether to take this opportunity. He evenconsulted a

8

lawyer.

9

He was advised that the Supreme Court of the United States

20

had held that these publications were legal, and after many

11

months on the first of May he accepted the distributorship and

12

became the distributor in the Philadelphia area, for this

13

publishing company.

4

14

Q.

Mr. Clark, you're putting an emphasis on that, Iem

15

not <|uite sure I follow it. Are you suggesting that if the

16

situation might be different, if there were some doubt about

17

the legality of the publications, that he was--

18

A.

The emphasis arises—

19

Q.

cloudy on—

20

A

The emphasis arises from what I believe is the con­

1

stitutional and certainly the national concern for reputation.

22

Here was a man who was concerned about his reputation. This is

23

a defamation action, and as the facts will dssclose, a jury

24

found he was defamed and he was a man who was captious enough

25

before getting into this business to be sure that it was a
5

!

proper business» a legal business, and it happened to be a

2

business that the Supreme Court itself had reviewed and up­

3

held.

4

On October the first--

8**

Ql

3

-— the falsity of the defamation, ultiate ly, doesnt

6

it, the fact that he consulted a lawyer to be sure that he

7

was carrying on a law-abiding business?

8
9

A.

It certainly bears on that, yes, it bears also on

his care for his reputation, too, which I think is important.

10

On the fitst of October, 1963, there was a series of

11

raids on newsstands, in the city, of Philadelphia, by city

12

police. On that day approximately twenty newsstand employees

13

were arrested. This petitioner, George Rosenhloom, who happened

24

to be making a delivery of his magazines at the time was

15

also arrested.

16

And on October the fourth, of 1963, there began a series

17

of more than twenty-one broadcasts, of which this respondent

28

here, referred to him and his business. Ehe first broadcast

29

which came over the air at 6:00 p.m. on October the fourth,
*

v

20

began."City cracks down on smut merchants." There had been

21

seven or eitht arrests on October the fourth, and on that, day

22

the WIP the Metromedia station in Philadelphia announced that

23

Mr. Rosenbloom's home had been raided, they gave his whole name

24

and his address, they referred to no other one else arrested,

25

they stated that there had been confiscated at his home a
6

t

z

thousand magazines and that he had been arrested on the char ?e
of possession of obscene literature»
i

3

In addition it stated that a barn that he rented had been

4

raided and there were confiscated obscene books. It did not

5

say allegedly obscene books, it said obscene bools. It said,

8

too, that Captain

7

investigating unit in the city of Philadelphia, at that time

3

believed that the police had Ii.it the supply of the main dis­

9

tributor of obscene material in the Philadelphia area.

10

Ferguson, who was in charge of the special

They broadcast throughtthe night and through the next day,

n

they repeaded generally this, the wotd allegedly obscene books

12

was add&.d to subsequent broadcasts.

33

The second series of broadcasts began on October twenty

14

first, and repeated, on variations, on the twenty-fifth, and

15

on November the first. These addressed themselves to a lawsuit

16

that, the petitioner here had filed to enjoin the police depart­

17

ment and the radio station in Philadelplia from harrassment,

18

interfering with his business. It did not endeavor to enjoin

19

generally their conduct but only insofar as he was concerned.

This damage suit filed later and came up before the same judge,

2

Judge Joseph Lord, III, in the city of Philadelphia,

53
V

The broadcasts characterized plaintiffs as smut distri­

4

butors , girlie book pedalers, and as attempting to force the

S

defendants, which included the Chief of Police and newspapers

6

and radio stations to lay off the smut liberatura racket,
Q.

so

alleged, or allegedly obscene, had not been in the case, if
they had just said he was a pedalar of girlie book magazines,

22

major element. But there are many other elements, I think to
have relied upon the Captain of Police who had phoned this in
under the impression that he ahd some duty to inform the public.
In other words, in contrast to Sullivan v, New York Times, here
you have Sullivan calling the New York Times and giving then
a story about somw fellow out in the street, And this situation
he is not known to anybody,
Q.

23

But what I was trying to get after, was would you

regard it as libelous if they said that he ®as a pedaler of
girlie book magazines?
A

23

24

Well, I think thei characterization by its choice, by

the radio station of the materials of obscene is certainly a

20

21

lir, Clark, if the.» word obscene, without the adjective

I think I would agree with dudge Lord that the edit-

orialization and the sensational way in which they characterize
his conduct to be defamatory, I think it would diminish him
i
8

1

in the eyes of his fellow man. and I think it would damage his

2

business, as certainly this damaged his business, very severely.

3

He lost 34 out of 60 accounts that he had been able to build up

4

and he went out of business, in fact. The other things that were

5

said that would add to that of course, were that he was the

6

main distributor of obscene material in Philadelphia, Nottf they

7

were relying on Captain Ferguson, perhaps, but do they really

a

have a right to rely upon him without any examination'? Is this

9

going to protect free speech or is it really going to interfere

10

with free speech when the police use the press as an extension

11

of their enforcement arm or vice versa?

12
13

Q.

But the term obscene becomes quite important in your

position, then, doesn’t it?

14

A.

That is an important element, yes, sir.

15

Q.

This implies, then, I take it you're arguing

that

16

that would imply an illegality which concievably might not be

17

present in the others.

IS

_ h.

»
The defamatory nature of that is certainly perfectly

19

clear to me. I think that there could be very little doubt about

20

it. But the impression, too, that he's trying to prevent law

21

enforcement from doing its duty, to lay off the smut literature

22

racket, is just erroneous. He was just trying to protect his

v

23
24
25

own interests, as a successful small business man in these sales,
Q.

What was the time interval between the raid and tb®.

first broadcast?
9

I

A

The raid was on the day of the fourth , October the

2

fourth and the first broadcast was at 6s00 p.m. on the fourth»

3

Now in the subsequent broadcasts, because this went on from

4

October fourth through November first»

5

The first-—

6

(X

Every day?

7

A

No, sir» October fourth., fifth, October twenty-one,

8

twenty five and

one. There were over twenty-one dif­

9

ferent broadcasts going out to the entire radio audience in

10

that entire metropolitan area. Of course, Mr» Rosenbloom can’t

11

have every radio station on — he doesn’t reaily find out until

12

people tell him what’s been said about him and he has to go

13

down to confirm it». But there was a delay of more than a week

14

fromthe time he filed his injunction suit trying to prevent

15

harassment and interference with his lawful business and the

16

time that the second series, as we’ve described them in the
0

■

17

litigation of these broadcasts began on October twenty one, so

18

it could hardly be called "hot news".
A week had gone by before they came on and characterised

19

20

him as a smut distributor and a girlie book pedaler and attempt­

21

ing to force the police and the District Attorney to lay off

22

the smut literature racket»
On October twenty seventh, Mr» Rosenbloom went to the

23
24

radio station, he had heard this, the prople were complaining

25

to

him about this, the record shows, the people that he had
10

1

sold to, his friends wouldn't talk to him» And he asked to

2

see copies or to hear some of the broadcasts

3

He was not permitted to see anybody» This is the plight

4

of somebody trying to engage in robust dispute in mass society

5

with the media» But he was put on the pbone with a part-time

6

employee who dug up one of the tapes and played it back to

7

him»

a
9

>

Mr» Rosenbioom protested that the supreme Court had said
that this material wasnnot obscene. The individual who was

10

wcrk^n9 the radio station said the DA had said it was obscene

11

and Mr, Rosenbioom replied that the DA had said at that time

12

in fact it was legal and at that thme they hung up on him»

13

That's the extent of his opportunity to speak out» Wally

15

16

17

public figure.

18

did» General Edmund Walker

George A» Rosenbioom is like most people in this world,

19

the overwhelming majority, not a public figure. The jury

20

charge said that there would be four elements in the proof of

21

defamation for general damages.

22

First, that there was harm to the reputation of the plain­

23

tiff. That it had lowered him in the estimation of his peers,

24

and that it detererd third persons from engaging in commerce

25

with him.
11

\

Second, that the allegations that were made could reason­

2

ably be taken to refer to the plaintiff. That his name and

3

his address were give, in this case.

4

Third, that the people exercise reasonable care to deter­

5

mine the truth of what they were saying and for which they

6

were sued.

7

And fourth that it was false.

a

To recover punitive damages it was required that malice

9

be shown under the Pennsylvania law, and the malice charge

10

there, roughly, was that it was published, or caused to be

11

broadcast with a bad motive or reckless indifference to the

12

rights of others.

13

The jury name in with a verdict of general damages in the

14

amount of $25,000, and punitive damages in the amount of

15

$725,000, The jury had seen some of the magazines.

16

The judge required a rerrmitature of $500,000, but he

17

found that malice was present, that there were at least three

18

substantial indications of it in the record, and that the

19

defendant there had broadcast in a sensational way and in an

20

editorializing way about the rights of this private citizen.

2?

He refused to apply New York Times v, Sullivan, because

22

he felt that it applied only to public ofififials, it had no­

23

thing to do with individuals. That first amendment protcc.tion

24

was intended to protect the processes of government in the con­

25

duct of government offials, the elective officials and such
12

I

things, and did not intend fco permit people to defaxae the pri­
vate citizen in America and destroy the quality of his life,
only if he could show that there was actual malice in a broad­
cast»
On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed on the basis of
Mew York Times. The--&

The Times was accepted to public figures in Butts

over the dissents of four of us. What do you say of Time,

again.

Hill o Do you think that-*- that "a a right to privacy case, but
the Mew York Times rule was applied by the majority in that
case too, wasn't it?

A,

Yes, it was» That was of course,——

Qi

Well, what. I'm getting at, do you think that this

Court has yet decided the question that you're presenting to
us?
A,

I don't think it's reached this question at all and

I guess that, 1 believe Butts and Walker are substantial evi­
dence of it» they, after ell, were decided after Times v. Hill»
Time v Hill was a right tc privacy case» And that is a right
that is cherished by civilised man, but the invasion of pri­
vacy that arises in a defamation case, that destroys the rep­
utation of an individual is the thing most cherished toy every­
one, what people think of him, what his reputation is in the
-community has hot been addressed by this Court»
The question was specifically reserved by Mr., Justice

13

' 1

Brennan in the opinion for the Court and it was referred to by

2

others there, Mr,Justice Goldberg and another Justice have

3

stated their view at that time that it would not apply to the

4

ptivate citizen,. The distingfcions really are many,
u

5

It is a concoramitant, in my judgement, of civilized life

6

that there will be invasions of privacy, I think that we need

7

to cherish privacy and we need to enlarge it to the extent that

8

we can but in mass urban society there are going to be invasions

9

of privacy and there’s some value to the public of invading.

■JO

But when the invasion reaches a defamatory level, and

11

comes up under the old and historic legal aotion for degamation

12

where there is injury to an individual form untruth, then I

13

think other factors come into play and I don't believe there’s

14

any abridgement to freedom of speech of freedom of the press

15

where such untruthful allegations are made and defame and damage

16

as they did Mr. Rosenbloom here, and that privacy comes under

17

just another field of law,

18

After all, as difficult and awkward and embarassinrr as

19

it may have oeen for the Kills, the family

20

ized as heroic, not as engaged in obscenity, the Life magazine

21

had ^banner leads on the pages that talked about

22

and "eourageoud daughter" and things like that, and which it

23

may have been of a nature that wasn't entirely true,it may have

24

been fictionalized, at least it was not daragaiory and damaging

25

to the individual and it lowered him in the eyes of those vith
14

was ehavaetev

"brave try,"

t

whom he had to live»

2

I think if we really want to protect free speech, we're

3

going to have to look at the powerlessness of the individual

4

in mass society and the great power of the concentration of the

S

media because of technology i.n the area of free "speech, and the

6

idea that there can be uninhibited and robust and wide-open

7

debate between the George Rosenblooms of this world and the

0

combination on the other side of the Captain Fergusons and

9

the Metromedia, It’s contrary to our experience. There’s no

10
11

marketplace for debate here.
If this man’s goin«f to have an opportunity to speak at

12

all it will be very difficult for him. He is not a famous

13

person.

H

When you look at the stand for obscenity that Captain

15

Ferguson usdd here, and when you realise the close and constant

16

communication between the police and the press you realize

17

what a vary difficult problem this is for the laymen who get

18

arrested. Because clearly, under Captain Fergusons’ test as

19

stated in the criminal trial as is revealed in this record here

20

in which there was a directed verdict of Not Guilty, the

21

creation of Adam by Michaelangelo in the Sistine Chapel would

22

be obscene„ as would the Birth of Venus by Botticelli,

23
24
25

That’s how, that’s what his standard of obscenity really
is, is the revealing of the private parts of the human anatomy,
No&, if an individual is to have any protection in his

15

I

free speech 1 think that;, and I do think that there's a con.

2

stitutional standard that applies, I think that those who would

3

speak out, the press, against the private individual that they

4

exercise reasonable care*

S

There’s a great value in the exercise of reasonable care»

6

The real purpose of the First Amendment is truth. The truth is

7

hard to know and therefore it has to have wide breathing room

8

But the vigor of the debate in the public area and the impoi-;

9

tance to the nation, that we vigorously debate public conduct

10

in public figures doesn't extend to the individual and the
■

1!
12

*■

private individual.
We can debate the issues to the extent of our heart. We

13

can debate nudism, we can debate magazine distribution but when

14

we bring that debate to bear on a private individual who has

15

no voice then we're going to have to exercise reasonable care.

16
!7
18

And if the eon&titution.can permit the states to require
reasonable care when someone makes allegations——
Q.

If you're right, that is to the private individual,

19

there ought not be any application of anything like New York

20

Times. It seems to me that the first Amendment ought not apply

21

but that this is an area in which state law in the old sense

22

has free prevail. Now, if 1 understand you, if you're applying

23

reasonable care, is this what, a First Amendment test to the

24

private individual, is that it?

25

I

A.

My judgement of the needs of free speech and there-

16

!

1

2
3
4
S

fore the dimension and strength of the First Amendment is that
even as to the private citizen, he!s not a public official and
he's not a public figure, that he cannot recover for defamation
if the person who is defaming has used reasonable care to as­
certain the trugh because even in that area—

&

&

Even if state law is to the contrary?

7

K

Well, this is, of course, based on state law, yes.

8

In other words the state law, the real question is how much

9

can state law encroach on speech in the defamation area. That’s

10

the real question.

n

Q.

12

official—

13

A.

Yes, of course—

U

Q.

The ordinary cizisen, but state laws differ all over

In the case of the non-public figure, or non-public

15

lot, don't they without any First Amendment restraints, in

16

that area?

17

k,

Well, the question here is fehat the first .Amendment

18

restraint is because the Third Circuit here has tried to place

19

a First Amendment restraint—

20

Q.

Well, then what I want to get is you do conceed that

21

even in this area of the private individual, so called, there

22

is a First Amendment restraint?

23
24
25

21

That's my judgement as to what the First Amendment

should do.
0.
I son8

Would the record in this case satisfy your stantard?

17

i

I don't see any instructions about reasonable care in this

2

case,

3

A.

Yes, that was the instruction. That was the instru­

4

ction for general damages and there was a malice instruction

S

for punitive damages,

3
<

Q.

Under state

A

Under state

law?
law, yes,

r

Q.

Not First Amendment law?

9

A

No, This is under the state law,

30

Q,

Under state

•11

A

Yes, under state law,

'2

Q.

law?

As I understand you your argument is that there is

a rol© for the First Amendment in a case like this, but it5s

14

a different standard than is applicable to the public figure,

35

or the public official, is that it?

m

A

That, of course, if it were your view that the First

17

Amendment had no. application to a private citizen then the

18

clsposition in this case would be perfectly clear, if you agree

19

thit htis is a private citizen,

20

0.

Then there'd be no question—-

21

A

Yes, the First Amendment would have no application

22

at all. I-—

23

0-

24
25

Well, I?m trying to get what your view is. Is your

view—A

My view is that is the First Amendment has a little
18

s

greater application than that» That, I think on issues that

2

debate has to be robust and wide open, but when it comes to

3

damgae individuals, if the individual is a public figure or

4

a public official then the importance of speech is such that

lP

-unless actual malice is shown, no recovery should be allowed.
If itBs a private individual, if it's a person that has

6

no real opportunity for counter-argument, if it's a person

7
8

who hasn't assumed the risk or stepped forward in this area,

9

then in my opinion only reasonable care is necessary because

10

-it is important too for the press to talk about the private

11
