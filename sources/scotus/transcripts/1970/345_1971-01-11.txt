Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

appeal from a decision of the District Court for the Central
District of California-, . dismissing a two-count indictment
against Appellees, the first for conspiracy to possess and the
second for the completed substantive act of possession of
unregistered hand grenades, in violation of 26 USC, Sec.
5861(d)o
That provision, which appears on page 4 of our
brief, makes it unlawful for any person, and I quotes "to
receive or possess & firearm which is not registered to him
in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Records.
Q

Does this involve only hand grenades?

A

That's correct, Mr. Justice Harlan? only

hand grenades, and I guess I ought to point out now, although I
was going to d© so later, that the provisions that we are con­
cerned with here do not apply t© all firearms, but generallyto sawed-off rifles and shotguns, short-barreled rifles and
2

i

shotguns , silencers, machine guns 0 other automatic weapons and

2

destructive devices such as bombs# rockets and hand grenades»*

3

The District Court dismissed the indictment on two

4

constitutional grounds»

First it ruled that 5841(c) was that

5

certain information be furnished the government before a fire™

6

arm is transferred# and Section 5861(d) are unconstitutional

7

because Section 5841(e) requires Appellees 'to furnish evidence

3

incriminating to themselves under California.law# making it

9

unlawful to possess hand grenades.

10

Second# the District Court ruled that Section 586.1 Cd

ii

/violates the Due Process Claitse because it does not require the

12

Government to allege and prove that a transferee obtained

13

possession of the firearm with specific knowledge andintent

14

that the firearm be 'unregistered»

Section 5861(d) and 5841(c) were enacted as part of
the Gun Control Act of 1968# and that act was passed by
Congress in response to the violence occurring earlier in 1968
md t© the fact that during 196? more than 130,000 people in the
United States were victimised by gunmen»
Title II of the Gun Control Act of 1968 with which
we are concerned her©# substantially amended the National
Firearms Act which this Court had dealt with in Haynes against
■the United States# which was decided in January of 1968’to
gethsr with Marchetti and Gross©»

In Haynes this Court con­

cluded that the ©Id registration and possession provisions ©f

3

i

the National Firearm,Act compelled self“incrimination and

2

that the privilege was a complete defense to a prosecution

3

under either the possession or registration provisions.

In amending the National Firearms Act in October

of 1368*, Congress set out to cure the constitutional infirmi­

references to its purpose to overcome the fire infirmities

10

and in this respect the Congress was doing just what Mr»

11

Justice Harlan invited it to do in his opinion in Haynes»

12

explained that a valid statute could h® enacted which would

13

achieve substantially the same purposes as the statutory

14

scheme dealt with by the Court in Haynes and which would not

15

run afoul of constitutional limitations.
Our position here is that Congress has done just

this.

A

Yes, sir; it is,

22

I think it would be helpful at the outset for me to

.23

describe briefly how the new National Firearms Act works in

To illustrate the provisions of the new act, let us

assume that a manufacturer who Is licensed to manufacture

If he wishes to

transfer them to another he may do so lawfully and the trans™

i?

ferae may receive them lawfully only in accordance with ‘the

\z

provisions of the Section 5812 of Title XXVI, which appears on

13

pages 2 and 3 of our brief.
Under Section 5812 a grenade may not be transferred

14
15

unless the transferor has filed -the requisite application in

16

duplicate with ATFD and has paid the transfer tax, which is

17

$200 in the case ©£ grenades.

application.

laws.

Q

Do they do that just t© play with them, ©r

A

Well-, I don't know what they do with them

what?

but, as we have pointed out in our brief, more than 180,000

firearms described in Title II are

registered.

A

That's rightj, plus I assume, the cost of

buying the firearm.
Mow, admittedly, Mr. Justice, most ©£ the firearms

22

registered are registered to law enforcement officials, but

23

there are substantial numbers of ■—

As I have said, in addition to the transferor's
application, there is appended the set of the fingerprints of

Mow , this package is sent, to the &TPD right here in

Washington.

That body is empowered to approve an application

nly if, and 'this is critical to our case — receipt or possession

of the firearm would not place the transfers© in violation of

17

state, local or Federal law©.

If ATFD rejects an application it returns the

original application and gives the reason for its action.

Only after the transferor has received the approved

t.

possession ©f the firearm and only then when he takes

z

possession, together with the approved application which- the

3

transferor delivers to him with the weapon,
Q

4

Well, your position is that this is, in

5

effect, then a prohibition against transfers which violate

6

local law?
A

7
8

'

Which violate local ©r Federal law, Mr,

Justice White.
Q

,9

ted that the transferee is just faced with

10

simply & prohibition against his receiving the weapon as long

n

as it8s a- violation of 'the law.
A

12

That8s righti similar to what you suggested

13

in Minor and Buie.

I should like, before turning to that

84

aspect ©£ the case, if I may, to set out in some detail cur

15

understanding of the old National Firearms Act which this Court

16

found in Haynes.
The old Section 5841 imposed on anyone possessing a

17
18

firearm the duty t© register that firearm unless it had been

19

mad® or transferred in accordance with the provisions of the

20

©id aeto

21

registered, cam® forward to register it under the old act, he

22

necessarily incriminated himself for possession ©f a firearm

23

that had been made or transferred in violation of the act f,

24

which was proscribed by the ©Id Section 5851.

.25

But, if a person possessing a firearm required t© be

Is short, a person was required to come forward to
8

1

comply with one provision of the statutory scheme„ but as

2

the risk of incriminating himself under another provision.

3

As Mr. Justice White pointed out subsequently in

4

the Minor and Buie ease last'term, the vice of the old

5

National Firearms Act was the same vice that this Court found

6

assisted with respect t© the occupational and excise taxes on

7

gambling in the Maxehetfei and Grosso cases»

8

person was required to come forward and reveal information as

9

to the gambling activities to Federal authorities, even though

In those cases a

10

disclosure of those activities could be made to other Federal

11

authorities and to state authorities and even though such

12

activities were proscribed by both state» and Federal law» '

13

Moreover„ Mr, Justice Harlan found in Haynes that

14

under the old statute., the only persons required to register

15

were those unlawfully in the possession of firearms.

16

registration requirements thus applied only to those inherently

17
18
19

20
21

22
23

The

suspect of criminality as did the requirements held imper­
missible in the Albertson case»
In the new National Firearms Act* Congress has
eliminated any possibility of self“incrimination of a tr■nsferee of a firearm* whereas the old statute requiring registra­
tion only by those unlawfully in possession of firearms, the
n®w statute requires registration by all possessors of fire­

24

arms with the single exception of the United States»

25

do not refute this»

Appellees

Se.c©ad9 ®sd@r the new statute theoniy persona

2

permitted to accept possession of firearms are those whose

3

possession would not place them in violation of law»

4

as relevant here, this limitation is spelled out in the last

5

sentence ©f Section 5812(a) which appears on page 3 of our

0

brief»

Insofar

Thus4, unlike the sitution in Haynes, not only did

3

the parson unlawfully in possession, not have a duty to come

9

forward and admit his unlawful possession, but. he cannot

10

register a firearm,

17

Haynes, and if he is convicted of unlawful possession it is not

After that there is no

23

hazard for them arises, because California law prohibits them

that ATFD may approve a transfer only if it is lav/ful under

Q

Mr. 2inn, what would happen if California

8

law were doubtful in its reading?

9

then , do you know?

10

A

Would permission be denied,

I think"that ATFD would make a judgment as to

tliere is any real dispute, however, about California laws in

this case.

Q

1 gather there isn’t.

And one last

16

questions was the argument you have presented today given to

17

Judge Ferguson, d© you know?

.

A

18

I say in substance it was, Mr. Justice.

19

There is a very short record appendix and I think that you will

20

see 'that the essence ©£ the argument was made, if not in the

21

full detail which we are making here and which we have mad© in

22

©ur brief.

23

The position of the United States is that Appellees

24

are in the same position as was., the seller ©£ narcotics in the

25

Minor case, which was decided lastterm.

' -' ii

If a person would be

1

an unlawful transferee it is extremely unlikely that he would

2

approach someone who is lawfully in possession in order to ob­

3

tain the firearm»

4

a would-be transferor who is unlawfully in possession.

3

the transferor is unlawfully in possession there is no way that

6

he can transfer the firearm to the transferee under the pro­

7

visions of the new National Firearms Act,

•that weapons may be transferred only by those lawfully in

9

possession.

.

10

It is far more likely that he would approach
And if

The act provides

In the unusual case where he does approach a lawful

transferee, it seams to us unlikely that such a transferee

A

I will in just one moment.

13

Even in the case where the would-be transferee

14

approaches a.lawful transferor and the lawful transferor

15

agrees to file an application, our position is that the would-

16

be transferee is not required to incriminate himself.

17

burden of filing the application is on the transferor under the

18

statute.

19

The

Now, while it's true that the transferee, the pro-

20

posed transferee must submit his fingerprints and a photograph,

21

these have never been thought to be protected by the Fifth

22

Amendment privilege.

23

Our provision is that the foregoing statutory

24

scheme would foa sufficient without more to sustain the indict­

25

ment against Appellee13 s self-incrimination challenge.
13

But, any

i

doubt as to the constitutionality of the new Federal National

Z

It

3 |l

Firearms Act is resolved legally by two other steps that
-

Congress took in 1968«,

4

First* it appealed 23 '0SC 6107* whichprovided for

5

the sharing ©f firearms registration and transfer information* .

6

with other law enforcement officials.

7

Secondly * it enacted Section 5848* which provides

8

that no information provided to the Government in connection

9

with the registration or transfer of firearms can be used
■

\

!0

directly or indirectly* as evidence against the registrant or j

11

applicant in a criminal proceeding involving prior or con­

tz

current offenses.

\ ^ar

While the immunity from us© provision does not

\

apply to future crimes* there is no realistic possibility of

14
\ |

self“-incrimination with respect to future acts.

15

This Court did not hold* as a general rule* in the

16

17

Marchetti case* that the possibility of future incrimination

18

is sufficient to justify present invocation of the privilege

19

in all circumstances.
On the contrary * the Court pointed out quite

20

clearly that in most instances the problem ©f future conduct
will not give rise to substantial risks of self-incrimination.
The Marchetti case was atypical* because anyone
24

SB

I;

who pays the occupational tax imposed on gamblers can be
expected to engage in gambling* an activity -chat is prohibited
14

1

or limited in 49 states»

z

of type or another of the kind of firearms that are desalt with

3

in Titi® II, is permitted by state law, as evidenced by the

4

fact that more than 180,000 firearms have been registered»

5

Here, on the other hand, possession

1

More importantly, unlike the situation in Marchetti

6

an application to transfer will only be approved if the

7

application would not place the transferee in violation of law®;

8

Had a similar- provision been operative in the gambling tax

9

area, only gamblers in Nevada would have attempted to register®.

|

10

The possibility that a parson once having lawfully having

n

obtained possession of a firearm under these registration pro-" 1

12

visions, would subsequently permit an unrelated, unlawful act

13

and that the prior registration will incriminate him in that

14

act, is in our view, too speculative to warrant protection of

IS

the privilege®

16

I will turn briefly to the due process issue®

This

U

breaks down into two sub-issuess first the question of whether

m

Congress intended that violations of this statute can be

19

punished without specific intent on the part of the transferee

20

to obtain an unregistered firearm and secondly, whether if

21

Congress so intended, as we submit it did, such a statute runs

22

afoul of due process limitations®

23

On the first aspect of this, well, we don’t believe

M

there is any substantial problems nothing in the statute

as

indicates that scienter is required®

15

Moreover, every Court of

j

I

Appeals whichpassed on this question under the old National

2

Firearms Act, which .insofar as pertinent here, was identical

3

to the new one, ever held anything but that scienter was not

4

required»

5

that Congress was going to change the ground rules in this

6

regard»

7
©

9

Nor does anything in the legislative history hint

There is not one word to this effect»
Under these circumstances, we believe it would be

wholly improper for tills Court to read in a specific intend
requirement, particularly since another subsection of the same:

10

provision of the acts Section 5861(1) expressly requires a

11

known violation for prosecution and particularly since, to

12

read in such a requirement would totally frustrate the Con­

16

17
18
19
20

2!
22
23

24

2S

gressional purpose in this case»
Finally, as t© the due process claims., as we under­
stand Appellees’ position it is based in large part on this
Court’s 5 to 4 decision in Lambert against California, tfhich
found repugnant under the due process clause the Los Angeles
ordinance requiring convicted felons who spent more than five
days in Los Angeles, to register with the chief of police»
We think that accepting Lambert as stating the
present view of this Court, that it is quite clearly distin­
guishable from the situation we have her©»

We’re not concerned

with somebody passively remaining in Los Angeles for more than
five days? we’re concerned here with people acquiring highly
dangerous weapons; hand grenades»
16

And we believe that the

%

authorities of this Court as early as the Balint case in 2.58

z

US , which dealt with narcotics and in -the Baender and Barnett

3

case in 2S5 US£ dealing with posssession of dies for the making

4

of §&^@rnraent coins., established quite clearly that this kind

5

of conduct can be regulated without regard to a specific in­

6

tent requirement^ no more than Congressional reasonableness; in

7

this area* involving dangerous weapons* is necessary to

8

satisfy the constitutional requirements.
We urge* therefore* that the indictment b© rein-

but for those dissenters in the

15

which preexisted the Haynes decision and haven't even been

18

And I will add to that that we are

16

But* just to set up this point* because I want to

x 'illinit there is a serious question

17

move on to the others *

38

on two grounds as to whether tills Court should or can retain

39

jurisdiction.

20

there is a question of t© what extent the judge relies on the

21

Treasury regulations as opposed to the statutes for those

22

justices who think that's important,

23

.

The problem of jurisdictionhas been notede but

And secondly* there is a question as to whether or

24

not we had more than just a determination of self “•incrimination

2S

or scienter* but an investigation ©f the facts* and rightfully

24

!

or VZOnfpCuXly, a determination by Judge Ferguson that this

2

entrapment is a matter of law.
Mow# if I may,, perhaps in reverse order# go to the

3
4

issue of scienter.

5

about whether or not there was an allegation ©f any kind of

6

knowledge here and the judge at the trial level found that# as

7

we see the indictment neither the statute nor the indictment

8

requires any kind of scienter# not even the most minimal kind?

0

not even the kind which says that the transferee knows that he

56
n

is
19
20
21

22

And Mr.-Justice Stewart asked a question

has something and knows what he has; that is his characteris»
tics that it3s a hand grenade ©r whatever# much less does it
allege that he knows it is unregistered at the time of its
receipt.

And none of these things were alleged.
Q

But you are talking only about Count 2 of the

indictment —
A

We8re talking only about Count 2 of the

indictment at that point; yes.
Q

Because Count 1 does contain those allega»

tions; doesn°t it?
A

Yes; it does.

X would quarrel with Count 1

of tli® indictment on another ~ but not on -that point; no.
Count 2 we ar® talking about there is no kind ©f
scienter whatsoever.

Mow# the Government below conceded and the

/23
24

Government here conceded that scienter had t© be proved.

So#

the question is% does the indictment have to obtain# have to
25

25
l

1

spell out some kind of scienter requirement?

2

would not be perhaps the place to reinvestigate the whole

3

function of the grand jury system? "et cetera, X assume that the

4
5

~~ as the statute was laid out to the grand jury and even they?!
■
in passing prima facie on some kind of responsibility that

8

would justify taking the man to trial? would not have had

1

knowledge apparently that the transferee was suppose to know

8

what they had andknow the character of what he had? so wa

9

don't know anything about the findings there.

■

10

And although this!

>

Secondly? as S say? there is a string of' cases

n

saying that the indictment has to allege this and it can8 fc be

tz

cured by a bill of particulars 9 as the old Caryll case ?

13

C**a-r-y-l-l, which X refer to? were the failure ©f ths indict­

U

ment to allege the necessary scienter requirement? renders it

85

fatal.
And 1 would suggest that on that ground that

16

17

indictment in this case is deficient..

Moreover? X feel that

18

the statute is deficient because it? because it doesn't have

19

any allegation of even that kind ©f knowledge.
There is? in the Governmentes brief? footnote 9?

20
2!

page 14? the suggestion 'that perhaps the statute without any

22

kind of scienter? could reach ridiculous results and they point

as

that out.

The suggested remedy is that if you have a noble

24

prosecutor that he won't prosecute and this same question was

25

argued again before Judge Ferguson and he seemed to feel that

.

26

j

1

there should be a government of laws and not of men and this

2

was not an adequate answer and consequently at page 38 of the

3

appendix he insisted that the government must allege scienter.

4

How * 1 also make the argument that regarding Count

5

1» if we take the reigning law in this country that when we

S

havea conspiracy to violate any particular statute* that it

7

requires more of an intent than in a substantive crime»

S

definitely in law* knowledge of the law and an attempt to want

9

t© follow the law.

j

And

And -there are a string ©f cases -that, are

10

cited? state eases and Federal cases* indicating that if that9s

11

the case* at least insofar as malum prohibitum- or "public welfarr;

12

crimes are concerned. .

13

I don't think that either one of -those terms are

14

to© helpful in trying to decide whether — there has been much

13

dispute and many text writers have had an argument as to what

16

fits into that category.

17

sited* for example* do refer to the Mann Act* white slavery*

18

allegations ©f fraud and things of that sort* but they are

19

not generically different than say* perhaps the possession of

2©

firearms in this case in terms of perhaps the gravity of the

21

action.

22

But* some ©f the cases that are

But* nevertheless* the conspiracy must embrace an

23

intent t© run afoul of the law and that is not alleged and

154

that was another one of the grounds which the trial court used
for dismissing the indictment.
27

Mow, in the issue of the allegation of scienter,

1

2

insofar as the unregistered character of the firearm is con-

S

eerned, it is our contention that this is one ©f the elements

4

of the crime.

S

wish to be understood as having totally relied upon that.

6

There is no question that that, in simplest terms, is an

7

example of where the Court has decided that, all things eon™

8

sidered, that ignorance of the law must be an excuse and a

0

majority oftha Court so held.

Although we cite the Lambert decision, we do not

10

But, here we5re not even talking about ignorance of

11

the law? we8re talking, if anything, about one of the facts of

12

the case.

13

i

Let me distinguish two situations.
The crime involved here »■» in other words, the

14

defense is not that the defendants did not know that there was

15

a law saying that you could not possess a firearm unless it

m

was registered, what we are saying is that one of the elements

ii

which should be pled and proved is that the defendants took

18
10

20
21

possession ©f a firearm knowing that the transferor had not
had it registered.

There is a world of difference, because

in the one case we are talking about just not knowing what the
law is and the person is presumed to know the law.

Here we are

.

22
23
24

25

talking about one of the elements of the crime that brings the
legal proposition into play and one of the elements of the
crisis is the characterisation of the weapon being taken.

And

that characterisation is that it is an unregistered character.
28

?

The question of whether or not the scienter re™

2

quirements reach this far and the question of analysis of what

3

kind of scienter this Court should decide tha statute is

4

intended fe© contain or as a matter ©f due process „ I have gone

5

through the various authorities and analysed the whole notion

6

of mens rea, history efc cetera„

7

that perhaps the Court should reevaluate.the whole area and I

B

sort p£ found that Sayre's test, when he talks about''the fact

9.

•that when you get to a crime that is sufficiently grave, that

10
11

And I'm disposed to think

it’s still not a regulatory measure, we're trying t© single out
where is the criminal treatment, which was expressed in the

12

law before Haynes and has been reexpressed that they are trying

13

to do away with people who are engaged in wrongful acts and it

14

even expanded the number of weapons t© cover rockets and

15

missiles and things like this which are not normally possessed

IS

by people just for hobbies *

17

And secondly, where imprisonment is too grave to

'18

allow the deletion (?) of mens re a, as he puts it, I think the

19

Court should at that point intercede and require a stronger

;20

scienter requirement.

Or, in the absence of any legislative

SI

finding that is not required, the Court should assume that it

‘22

should be there, based upon the common law history and -the

S3

gravity of the crime.
This crime's count 2, for example, carries a penalty
of up to ten years or $10,000.

Formerly it was five years or
29

1

$5,000.

S

to whether he may have a right to counsel for a traffic ticket,'

6

as opposed to, say, & felony or major felony or major mis­

demeanors , and 1 think perhaps some of the same considerations

8

that go into making a decision as to whether it's significant

9

enough to attach the right to counsel and to insist on -the

The Court might wish to borrow my analogy from its

10

right to jury might also b® implemented here in deciding

11

whether or not we could have a strict liability statute or

n

in effect, punish somebody for a crime that's meant not to be

13

a crime, unless we are possessing an unregistered firearm and

14

say that the person doesn't have to have knowledge of it.

I throw it on the mantel

Thirdly, I might think that perhaps you have fee have

Fourthly, I might

think that itss all right for me t© take possession of it, but
8

And if a person ifas guilty, for example, of quite

9
10

reasonable kind of thinking, the fourth type is certainly — you

n

would have to have a statute which would allow a reasonable

iz

period of time to register the weapon.

13

candidly concedes; ©nee the person takes possession of it, that

u

is a crime and there is nothing on earth that he can do to make

is

himself law abiding thereafter.

And as the Appellant

So, I just think the fact that we're dealing with

16
17

hand grenades should not cause the Court to feel like a strong

18

mens re a requirement should not be exacted when we’re talking

19

about a very severe crime With a great deal of gravity.
Do you mean exacted by the constitution or by

20
21

22

statute?
A

That's & tricky question and I have some

23

thoughts on it, but ©a either basis I think the Court might say

24

in the matter of constitutional law, but if it chooses not to

25

put it on that basis I think it would be a reasonable statement;

.

i

31

1

to say that whan we're talking about this kind of crime with

2

this kind of penalty that Congress should have the affirmative

obligation of making it quite express as to whether they feel

they want strict liability or whether they are going t©

ORAL ARGUMENT (CONTINUED) BY LUKE MC KISSACK, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES

s
6

MR. MC KISSACK:

Thank you, Your Honor.

7

I think I have reached the self-incrimination

8

argument and I was saying that I think that much more is re­

9

quired of the transferee- here than would be the party we would

10

be concerned about in, say, the Minor case or some others.
I mentioned also the question of statutory regula­

11
12

tions that were used to embroider the statute exacting insofar

13

as the trarisferee is concerned,

14

of them.

15

I'd like to refer to a couple

Ism referring now to Title XXVI, the Code of

,

16

Federal Regulations 179.99 and this is the one where the

17

individual himself has to attach a copy of a photograph made

18

within a year and affix his fingerprints to this application,

19

where he is saving:

20

indicating he is ready, willing and able.

Et

cleared, efc cetera, and then his application has to be authen­

22

ticated by the local chief of police and the sheriff, the

23

"I want to take charge of hand grenades,'8
They have got to be

United States Attorney, United States Marshal, or anybody ac­
ceptable to the Director of Alcohol, Tobacco and Tax Division,

2

Mow, if you take this in conjunction with another

3

section, which is 178,98 which talks about a delivery or a

4

sale and is prohibited unless the person to receive such de­

5

vice furnishes the licensee a sworn statement in triplicate,

§

setting forth;89 Ca) the reasons why there is a reasonable

7

necessity for such person to purchase or otherwise acquire the

3

device or weapon, and (b) that such person^ receipt for

possession of 'the device or weapon would be consistent with

1©

public safety, ' Such sworn statement shall be attached to the

n

application to transfer and register the firearm.'- acquired by

12

179 of this chapter.

13

not be made until after the application is approved," et

.14

cetera.

The sale or delivery of the device shall

Now, all of these tilings take place before the

15
10

director makes the ultimate determination as to whether he

17

thinks it3s lawful and whether the transfer is going fe© be

18

approved,

19

So, I think then we have the kind of situation en­

20

visioned by much of fee language in the Marchetti decision where

21

we“re not just talking about confession of past crimes? I

22

think it was Ms;, Justice Harlan who said something about the

23

fact that the person may confess before the act is evidenced,

24

or maybe befor© the act is done,

N

25

And then we5re not talking about just totally in the

39

i

Fifth Amendment area; the protection of necessarily innocent

2

people, but we5re talking about society making a judgment by

3

virtue of the Fifth Amendment to place off limits as a criminal

4

investigativ© team, a defendant* presumably his lawyer and in

5

some jurisdictions, perhaps his wife, and I don't think that's

6

unreasonable»

7

domestic tranquility, the legal process through the presence

8

of the attorney and also the sanctity of the individual»

9

that's all we're talking abouti not using the individual as

10

it

I think by doing that we not only preserve

And

his own accuser»
And, in Marchetti the Court has mentioned that

12

we're protecting the imprudent as well as the innocent andtthe

13

foresighted»

14

I think, therefore, if we put all of this together

15

and you get all of the fingerprints, the photographs, the

16

affidavit as to why he should have it, et cetera, and all of

17

this stuff is transferred, then would it say that subsequently

18

someone makes a decision that it's unlawful for him to have it,

19

doesn't mean that there is n© self-incrimination problem»

20

In fact, as the Government concedes on page 6 of

21

its jurisdictional statement of facts, something to the effect

22

that it's true that the regulations involve the potential

23

transferee more deeply in the application process than was the

24

ease in Minor»

25

And he's quite deeply involved»

And ©£ course, we are concerned here with the

like states do, by the law enforcement, people or people who
fight fires or whoever needs these various items can have them,

far-fetched to think that somebody who goes through this
