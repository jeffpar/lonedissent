ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. DETRICK:

Do

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The second question raised by this Court's grant

13

of a writ of certiorari was the question of the retroactivity

14

of 0'Callahan v. Parker.

15

v. Parker is precisely the kind of case that should be given

16

full retroactive application so as to apply to Petitioner's

17

conviction, even though it became final within the military

18

appellate system some six years prior to this Court's decision

19

in 0'Callahan v. Parker.

20

It is our submission that 0sCallahan

The Court has laid down a series of three criteria

21

for determining the question of retroactivity significantly

22

in Linkletter v.

23

criteria are the purposes of the decision in question, the

24

reliance .by. law enforcement, authorities on the"'standards

25

existing prior to the substantive decision and the impact on

Walker

and Stovall v. Denno.

19

Those three

2

Nowt in the context of these three criteria the

3

Court has often said that the crucial question is whether the

4

proscribed activity affects the integrity of the fact-finding

5

process,
I would submit that the very heart of the court

6
7

martial system is in question in 0’Callahan»

8

integrity of the process by which 0sCallahan and Petitioner

9

were convicted was no less impugned by his conviction for a

I think that the

10

crime that the court had no powers to try and convict him for*,

11

than for his conviction for a crime that he did not commit at

12

all»
In both cases the defect in his convcition goes to

13
14

the very center of its legal justification»

15

court's emphasis on the integrity of the fact-finding process

16

is merely an

proceeding,

against the risk of the conviction of the innocent.

1

increased the risk of conviction and yet the — conviction of

2

the innocent# and yet the Court went on to find that the

integrity of the fact-finding process by which that accused

was convicted# was necessarily undermined by that process»

hud the Court went on to give

S

retroactive application despite any considerations of

reliance by lav/ enforcement authorities for the impact on the

partial retroactive application only in that it should not

factors of reliance by law enforcement authorities and the

impact on the administrationof justice»

out that this Court has often held that when the purposes of

a decision do favor its retroactive application, which I will

19

submit, the purposes of O'Callahan do, the factors of reliance

20

and the impact on the administration of justice are not sig­

21

nificant and are not to be taken into consideration*

22

I would like to point

It is only when the purpose is ambiguous as to

whether it favors retroactivity or not that those two considera-

ORIL ARGUMENT BY ERWIN N. GRISWOLD,, SOLICITOR

7

GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES, ON BEHALF OF

8

RESPONDENT.

9

MR. GRISWOLD:

10

Thank you»
Thank you»

May it please the Court:

There is no dispute about the facts

in

this case.

1!

Itinvolves a serviceman who was stationed at fort Dix , who was

12

off duty on the evening pass and not in uniform.

13

occurred within the boundaries of a military reservation*

14

incidentally his military reservation where he was stationed.

IS

The victims were dependents of servicemen and in one case the

!

6.

The crimes

14-year-old sister of the serviceman who was visiting his wife

17

who had just given birth to a child in the Army hospital at

m

Fort Disc.

'19

In the other case the wife of a member of the Air

20

Force stationed at McGraw Air Force Base* immediately adjacent

21

to Fort Bix, and employed on the base.

22

Q

How did Fort Campbell get into this case?

23

A

I don't know, Mr. Justice, I didn't know that

24
25

it had got into it.

Q

I saw somewhere that —

24

1

A

I don't know where Fort Campbell is.

z

Q

— I guess the soldier visiting his wife in

3

•the hospital was right

4

A

I believe that h© was assigned to Fort

5

Campbell* but the appropriate hospital* apparently* was at

0

Fort Dix* and that's where his wife had come.

7

These were crimes of violence* involving kidnapping

8

and rap®.

9

120 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and kidnapping* the

A rape is specifically made a crime under Article

'10

charge of kidnapping* was brought under the so-called General

11

Article* Article 134,

12

Q

Did the rape actually take place on the post?

13

A

Yes* Mr. Justice.

14
15

All of the events* both

the rape and the kidnapping occurred on themilitary reservation
A radical change* I think it may be fairly said*

16

was introduced under the law in this area by this Court's

17

decision in 0'Callahan against Parker* decided on June 2* 1969.

18

That decision left in its wake many undecided and uncertain

19

questions of which the military lawyers and the Court of

20

Military Appeals had been working hard to resolye until other

21

cases can be brought forward like -this one* for guiding light

22

from this Court,

23

One of the problems* of course* is the retroactive

24

application of the 0sCallahan decision to which I will return

25

later in my argument.
25

An immediate concern, however, to the lawyers who

i

z

are responsible for the administration of military justice, are

3

such questions as these, not all of which are involved in -tills

4

case, but I want to list them as some of the problems in orcier

5

to put this

case in a. larger setting 0
In the first place, the standard

6

set up in the

7

0'Callahan case is service-connected.

8

connected?

9

on a military reservation and is committed by a serviceman?

What is service-

Is it enough if in this country the offense occurs

10

Does that apply to all offenses, including fraud, bad checks

11

and so on?

13

crimes under what circumstances?

Or only to crimes of violence? And if so, what

13

And, enlarging somewhat on that, is there any way

14

that there can be a sure, simple test or standard of this or

15

must it be resolved case by case some way trying to work out

16
17

18
19
20
21

22
23
24

25

the facts of each case as to whether there is enough here to
make it service-connected or not?

The latter, of course,

obviously involving great difficulty and frequent reconsidera­
tion through appeals, hafoeus corpus and so on.
Can a court martial try an offense which occurs
off a military reservation in any case?

For example, an

assault by one serviceman on another in a non — in a public,
non military place?
And then another question of great importances can
there be a ruling of the right not to be tried by court martial?
26

'I

For example, the serviceman in a city, near his base in a

2

southern state, might be charged with an. -offense with racial

S

overtones.

4

and the local authorities be willing.

5

his consent? If a court martial has no jurisdiction it may be

S

hard to support a waiver.

He might much prefer to be tried by court martial
Can this be done with

7

Q

Is that question raised here?

8

A

That question is not here.

9

I'm trying to

put this in its broader context.

10

Or, suppose that a Navy ship calls' at Norfolk.

11

Q

As you know, the historic practice of the

12

Court is to put the problem in its narrowest, rather than its

13

broadest

14

A

Yes, Mr. Justice, but —

15

Q

Especially with 'a constitutional overtone.

IS

A

And I will get to the narrow facts, but the
v“

17

broad problem is one of great concern and the form of this

18

Court's opinion can be ©f'considerable significance, as well as

19

the result it reached ~ reaches.

Navy can be much more

legible with such punishments as reduc­

8

tion in grade, extra duty or week-ends in the brig, which may

9

be effective in many cases and less disruptive of tha military

10

service.

And then there is whole area abroad»

Can there be

The alternatives may be to turn all such offenders

22

over to the local authorities, which may mean trial by an

23

24

here,

25

All of these questions and more have been left in

28

1

uncertainty since the 0sCallahan decision.

2

guidance is needed.

3

This Court3s

The problems arise not only in the matter of current

4

trials, but in offense committed after the OeCallahan decision

S

and in habeus corpus with respect to past convictions* but also

6

in suits for various collateral remedies* such as back pay*

7

restoration to rank* correction of military records and so on.

8

It is a very complicated area filled with many difficulties*

9

both past and prospective.

1©

And now let me turn to the particular problem®'

11

presented by this case.

12

constitutional provisions which shed any light on this problem*

13

other 'than the provisions of the 5th and 6th Amendments* to the

14

extent -chat they are not made inapplicable.

15

tional provisions as Article 1* Section 8* Clause 14 and the

10

except claus'e in the Fifth Amendment.

11

expressly —

18

Q

Suppose the necessary and proper clause —

19

A

Yes* Mr. Justice* but that was pretty much

There are* as far as I know* only two

These? two constitu­

The first of these

20

right out of this area in the cases Reed and Covert (?) and the

21

later cases and 1 don’t want to throw away anything that any

22

member of the Court thinks is useful to our side* but 1 don’t

23

particularly rely on -the Necessary and Proper Clause.

24

see how it can expand the field within which Clause 14 gives

25

power* although it can certainly affect the way in which that

29

1 don’t

1

power is exercised.
Clause 14 expressly gives to Congress the power to'

2
3

make rules for the Government and regulation of the land and

4

naval forces* and it is* of course* as much a part of the

5

constitution as are fcha 5th and 6th Amendments.

6

And second* excepts *cases ©rising in the land and

7

naval forces*" from the Grand Jury Clausa of the Fifth Amend­

8

ment, showing that the framers of the Fifth Amendment* two

9

years after -the constitution went into effect* did not think

10

they were restricted in the power that had been granted by

'11

Clause 14.

iz

The whole structure of military justice rests on

13

these and it was these provisions which the Court construed and

14

applied in the 06Callahan decision.

15
16
17

18

They are obviously quite

general and quite a lot can be read into them ©r not.

Now *

obviously 0sCallahan read less into them than had previously
been supposed* but how much and on what basis or principle is
not yet wholly clear.

19

Since June 2* 1969* a considerable number of cases

20

have come before the Court of Military Appeals* which has the

21

responsibility in the first instance* of trying to work th®se
|
matters out. These decisions are summarized on pages 6 to 3

22
23
24
25

of our brief.

The Court ©f Military Appeals has held that

0sCallahan does not apply to petty offense and that court* the
Court of Claims* and several District Courts have held that an
■*

30

1

off-duty* off-post crime committed overseas may be punished

2

by court, martial and this Court denied certiorari in a case

3

involving that question last term, and again in another ease

3

factor approach that does not permit the statement of rules of

It reminds me a bit of the massing of the elements

10

approach that sometimes follows this conclusion0 if I may say

1!

so, in some modern state decisions in the field ©f conflict of

12

laws.

13

The Court of Military Appeals appears to have de­

14

veloped a rule that crimes' committed by a serviceman on post

15

are without more,, sufficiently service-connected to justify

The Petitioners suggest that court

11

such as failing to salute, ©r assaulting an officer.

12

But, the constitutional authority for the government

13

and regulation of the land and naval forces surely covers more

14

than the authority to arrest a member of the forces who

15

jeopardises the safety and security of his post and turn him

16

interest in the problem for prosecution.

Q

Mr. Solicitor General, do you know how many

19

servicemen are now incarcerated or serving sentences under

20

court martial sentences?

21

Are there any figures on it?

There are some figures quoted in O'Callahan

The contention which we urge seems to have been

14
15

recognised inthe 08Callahan opinion, which referred to the fact

that the crimes there were not committed on a military post or

18

the crimes there did not affect the security of the military

A post cannot be segregated into

In the interest of clarity we urge the Court to

hold that a fact that a crime committed by a serviceman against

territorial jurisdiction test which is traditional in our

criminal law, is alone enough to warrant a court martial of 'the

How I turn to the other question on which certiorari
was granted.

It's also important in the administration ©f

military justice to know whether the O'Callahan decision is to

1

be applied retroactively and if so, to what extent.

2

a favorable decision on either question would dispose of this

the many people having responsibility in this areas military

personnel, military judges, the Court of Military Appeals and

the lower Federal Courts, may have appropriate guidance in

7

carrying out their duties.

much guidance that's still needed.

Now, this has required

Q

We

Mr. Solicitor General, the *—■ was the

0 s Callahan holding ever

was 'the point raised in 0'Callahan

ever raised before in any cases and rejected? .
A

Yes, Mr. Justice it had been raised in s

number of cases in the lower courts, all of which had decided
that there was jurisdiction for court martial trials.
36

It was

1

the first time that this question had ever been brought to

E

this Court, although in a number of the previous cases

3

certiorari had been denied,

4

Q

5

But, was the matter mooted at all in the

last codification of military —

6

A

I think it's fair to say that it has not been

7

mooted at this level.

article published in 1960 which is cited in our brief, a Law

Review article, but —■ and 2 think it's also appropriate to say

10

that in the cases which held that nonmiiitary persons could not

11

be subjected to court martials Reed and Covert and Kinse11a

12

against Singleton and several others, even with the benefit of

13

the hindsight which I now have in rereading those opinions, I

14

can find no suggestion by the Court that this was an area

15

involving servicemen which was subject to reconsideration,,

The only suggestion, I think, was in an

I think more specifically on that, in the opinion

16
17

of the Court, in Kinsella against Singleton in 36XUS written by

18

Mr. Justice Clark with seven members of the Court concurring

19

in that decision, he said, beginning on page 240 and continuing

25

authoritative word from this Court and the last intimation,
37

And I think that was the last

1

z

until the 0’Callahan case was decided,,
Q

Mr.

olicitor General# the rule as I under-

3

stand it# was not that automatically and. without exception he

4

was tried by the military.

5

There were cases in World War II where one in par­

6

ticular# at Camp Claiborne a rape occurred on Camp Claiborne’s

7

territory and the men were investigated by the CXD# @t cetera

8

and they turned over to the civilian Federal authorities —

9
O

A

I think# Mr. Justice# it is right that .

there was quite a considerable practice of concurrent juris­

11

diction ^ and that it was not denied that the states had the

12

power to try# depending on these complicated questions about

13

the title and ownership of the military reservations# which

14

are very confused —

15

16
17
18
19

20
21

Q

It may not be pertinent# but the largest

camp at that time was Totten Military Reservation.
A

Yes.

And I have no doubt that there are many

cases of concurrent jurisdiction.

All I am asserting is that

where it does involve a serviceman and is on the base# that
it should be subject to military jurisdiction.
Mow# the problems of retroactivity are now before

22

this Court in other cases and they are difficult.

23

my argument on this I would like to refer to another — a

24

pair of cases which are not cited in our brief.

The Chambers case is one which arose out of the

prosecutions which had not become final were solved with the

repeal of the 18th Amendment.

And the Chambers case itself simply holds that pending

But the question of what to do about conditions which

had become final before the 21st Amendment was adopted never

courts and this Court always denied certiorari and the whole

inferences, the whole basis of assumption in the Chambers

opinion, recognised in the ensuing failure to take up any cases

Q

9

Mr. Solicitor, d© you have any figures at

all or have any idea of the impact on the — that retroactivity

10

would have — let's assume that O'Callahan did not reach this

11

case? that this was a service-connected crime.

IE

13
14
15
16

What about

retroactivity of 0'Callahan on that understanding in terms of
impact?
A

I do not know, Mr. Justice, how many persons

are now being held for nonpuraly nonmilitary offenses, pursuant
to judgments which became final be ere June 2, 1969.

I can

n

say from my own ^experience 'that there have been fewer petitions

m

for habeus corpus relying on 0‘Callahan than I anticipated that

19

20

there would be.

Should this Courthold that it is retroactive,

I would anticipate that there would be a considerable increase
\

21

22
23
24

in the number of such petitions.

I will endeavor to see if I

can get any figures on that and submit them with respect to
the other materials I have said I would present.
And so, we submit that the judgment below should be
affirmed on both grounds.

That is that there was court martial

25

40

1

jurisdiction here and that 08Callahan -should not be given

2

retroactive application to this case.
