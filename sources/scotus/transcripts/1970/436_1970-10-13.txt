The question presented to this Court is whether in

racial segregation -- non-contiguous soning, satellite zoning,

pairing, busing, a bewildering army of deviations in grade

in the service of segreagation now ought to foe used in the

service of integration.

novation, that is the exclusive employment of the neighborhood

14

schools, whatever that means, now suggested by the United

15

States and the respondents as a method of school assignment,

even though it results in an exceedingly high degree of racial

concentration.

Some children had in the past in Mobile sometimes

19

been assigned on the basis of seme concept of neighborhood

20

among the number of other assignment factors. But as the sole

21

means of assignment, it is an innovation.

22

It might be added at this point, at least I would

23

like to add at this point parenthetically, an answer to the

24

argument which emerges from this sharp departure in adminis­

25

tration, which was. anticipated yesterday by counsel for the

2

stated today* two wrongs do not make a right.

the only answer to this series of facts which esist here in

Mobile and in the other cases, the other cases argued earlier.

He conceded two wrongs do not make a right was the only answer.

And however satisfying that aphorism might be, a brief analysis*

we submit, illuminates the issues in this case.

we submit that upon an evidentiary hearing we could demonstrate

that the facts are far worse.

their statistics, results in 7,651 or about two-thirds of all

19

white students.

respondents have informed the district court, for reasons

that we do not know, not ail of them and perhaps none of them

are attending the schools to which they are assigned.

is a motion pending in the district court about that, but we

have not been able to get a hearing.

There

Moreover, the petition which we took to this court

6

involves only elementary schools.

The high school situation,

7

however, under actual enrollment figures now furnished seems

8

far worse than projected in the government’s plan, which was

9

essentially adopted below.

As page 3 of our supplemental

10

brief indicates, more than 6r700 Negro students will be going

11

to high school and junior high school in all-black schools,

12

therefore we have a situation in which the preponderant number

13

of black students in metropolitan Mobile will be spending

14

half of their education, the elementary years, in all-black

15

schools, and the so-called paliative of integrated junior hiqh

16

and high school education which does not in any event cure

17

denial of constitutional rights for the first six years will

18

in fact not exist to them.

19

«

And the issue is does this final -- this is a final

20

desegregation plan, does it satisfy the Fourteenth Amendment.

21

The Fourteenth Amendment rule has most recently been expounded

22

in Green and Alexander as requiring the ending of the last

23

vestages of segregation and the elimination of segregation

24

jroot and branch.

25

And we submit that that imperative is far,

exceedingly far from having been satisfied.

1

How* the justification offered by respondents and

2

the United States for leaving racial segregation essentially

3

intact in metropolitan Mobile is that the result is required

by neighborhood schools.

On this record, the school district buses more than
20*000 students at an average round-trip of thirty miles a day.

10

Most of the busing is in the rural area, but there is a sub­

11

stantial amount at shorter distances in the city, and so busing

12

is hardly foreign to Mobile education, and this figure compares

fairly well with the fact that 40 percent of all American

Some of this busing has

15

Now, if this analysis of the last five minutes has

16

not completely laid to rest the fact that there is nothing to

17

the notion of neighborhood schools in Mobile, I would like to

18

add that in the black areas, whenever they had a school where

19

the capacity of the school was filled up with black children

20

and they wanted to put more blacks in, they added portable

21

classrooms, and the record shows with respect to white

22

children they did the same thing.

23

can determine the neighborhood it will serve, but where the

24

capacity of a school is a readily expandable thing, like an

25

accordian, it is like an Alice in ftfenderland.

capacity of the school.

in Mobile portable classrooms, the record shows, were substan­

tially added to black schools while white schools were under­

capacity, and this is shown by respondents' report which is on

6

page 208 of the Appendix and in Appendix B to our brief.

7

Appendix B to our brief has a list of portable classrooms.

8

And so the notion of neighborhoods as somehow related to a

9

fixed capacity of the school, well, we would submit in no cases

10

The capacity of the school is whatever

the school board decides it will be.

In fact,

applicable here is ludicrous.

An expert witness said he had

In other words, the notion of neighborhood as deter­

mined by the capacity of a school serving a geographical area

is even ■— well, it is a concept that is really not capable of

definition, certainly in this case.

consist of something like the shape of a dumbbell, two large,

round areas connected by a connecting bar.

The connecting bar

10

in there is called a neighborhood, and if you take that out,

11

it is called non-contiguous song and not a neighborhood school.

12

But the complexities and curiosity of the neighbor­

13

hood school system in Mobile are even more fantastic than

14

that.

The question for this court, therefore, is 'whether

20

and which remains completely segreafced until 1969, and which is

21

still now overwhelmingly segregated as the result of a so-

22

called final desegregation plan under which it now operates,

23

Is that a matter as to vfhich the

Well, Mr. Chief Justice,

I would like to make

17

several observations, in an effort to answer that, and one is

13

that in a city like Mobile,

19

come before a court or this Court, we have a situation in which

20

the Constitution has been violated without a doubt to their

21

knowledge from 1954 to 1969 and it may be not asking too much

22

to take another look at it again three years later.

23

as if they have been thoroughly well-integrated for a hundred

24

years and someone is suddenly calling them into court.

25

Secondly, it may be that the court will have to look
15

1

afc it, as indeed policing an antitrust decree or a water rights

2

case or anything like that.

3

will have to be made on the merits of the case.

4

question implies, will a period arise sometime in history in

S

which a court will no longer ever have to look at it again, I

6

imagine that at some point it would arise but now one year-

7

after Mobile has first taken a step, going only as far as it

S

has, I think the suggestion is premature to consider that

9

question.
Q

10

It is possible that an adjustment
As your

But in the hypothesis I was putting to you,

f1

there is no element of discrimination that brings this about,

12

but merely natural change in the structure of the community.

13

So is it your position then that the court has a duty -- the

14

school board in the first instance, the court, the party must

13

go in and see to it that adjustments are made to reflect the

16

composition of the community independent of any discriminatory

17

motive?1
A

13

Well, again, that is not this case but I don't

19

want to evade your question by giving that kind of an answer to

20

it.

21

afc this'time to undo a long history of quite vigorously en­

22

forced discrimination.

23

case, I would assume that in a period of three years the racial

24

segregation which has been so virulent and has, as Mr. Habrifc

25

said earlier, been a part of American history, as slavery, for

Q

What I am driving at is that last point I was

trying to mates to you, is this always tied to the discrimina­

Yes, that is correct.

Mr. Chief Justice, there is a time when the courts

can divest themselves of this problem.

17

that would be three years from now, but it would be at some

18

time and we don't know when.

Well, if they are wholly private decisi on--makinc

I was going to say that the questions of this Court,

7

as we see it on this record, is whether in a school system

9

segregated until 1969, and which is now still overwhelmingly

10

segregated as the result of a so-called final desegregation

It

plan, this Court supervising district courts sitting in equity

12

should fashion an effective remedy to forever end the uncon­

13

stitutional administration of the school system so far as race

14

is concerned.

15

We submit that this Court as a remedial measure

16

should declare a rule which requires that every black child at

17

every grade in his educational career must be free of assign­

18

ment to a racially identifiable minority school.

19

school, in the language of our brief, is one which by reason of

20

a very considerable concentration or disproportion is conceived

21

as designed to receive black children.

22

Q

And such a

I would like to ask a question that 1 asked

23

yesterday in somewhat different context.

24

position, the position that is spelled out very clearly in your

25

brief, and you have just expressed very clearly here.
19

I understand your

But is

i

it your position that that is the test that must be met in

remedying and rectifying a previously dual school system on

3

the one hand» or is it your position that that is test that is

4

requiredsubstantively by the Fourteenth Amendment* regardless

5

of the history of a particular school system?
A

6

Well» it is the former but the two are infcef►f

- 7

twined because you do not get to disestablish a segregated

8

school system except for th$ Fourteenth Amendment* unless it

9

is state or federal legislation* but it is essentially the

10

Fourteenth Amendment we are talking about in eases like this.
What we are talking about is of a remedial measure.

11

S2

We are talking about remedy, but frequently from remedies

rights do stem.

15

compel divestiture, which is a remedy that you could not do

but for the fact of a certain substantive violation.

it is a remedy.

In an antitrust case you may get a right to

However,

So then do I understand that it is not — you

19

do not claim that it is the personal individual constitutional

20

right under the Fourteenth Amendment of a Negro public school

21

child to attend throughout his school career a school that is

22

not racially identifiable?
A

23

I want to be sure that 1 understand your ques­

24

tion.

Your limiting your question to areas where there has

25

been segregation imposed by law —
20

1

Q

STo, I am limiting my question -- I am asking

z

you whether it is your position that the Fourteenth Amendment

3

confers upon every school child in the United States, and par­

4

ticularly every Negro public school student, the right to

5

attend racially non-identifiable schools throughout their

6

school career, throughout his school career?

7

A

My answer is no, and I would have to explain

8

the reason for the answer so I am sure 1 am not misunderstood.

8

It appears to me that you are essentially raising what might

10

be called the de facto question, whether where there has been

11

no de jure segregation and there is nevertheless a consider­

12

able concentration of black students in a racially identifiable

13

school, nevertheless one may obtain a decree from a federal

14

district court integrating the schools according to the
>

13
16

measures we propose.
My answer to that is we require some finding of --

17

we think that the rulings of this Court require that there

18

have been some segregation imposed by law.

19

that in parts of the country which are normally not referred

20

to the South, out of the South, one can find that segregation

2!

imposed' by law, as in Denver, and in New Rochelle, and other

22

places where it has been found, and it hasn't been done by

23

courts, and we think that a searching record in other places

24

would turn it up as well.

25

We think, however,

We will assume that there are places where that has
21

1

not been established and cannot be established, and in those

z

places I personally would be willing to urge a court that the

3

same remedy should apply, would be on a different basis and

6

not this case,, and I ~~

3

Q

6

stitutional right?
A

7
3

Then you would say it is a substantive con­

I would concede that it is an open question

and hardly the thing to be decided here today.

0

Q

But in that case it would not be a remedy to

rectify an illegal situation?

n
tz

A

How, in that case, one would

have to find a substantive right.
Q

13
14

That is correct.

It would be a personal substantive constitu­

tional right in that hypothetical.
A

15

That's right, but that is not this case.

This

16

case is a case

we argue on the basis of remedy and I would

17

readily admit,

as I would have to, a fair reading of the cases

18

indicates that is the case in open question.

that they would have to cane under the rules which

understand how that would foe feasible or workable.

A

19

it is difficult for me to

It worked pretty well,

the way they had it.

I mean feasible or workable to integrate the

11

schools, is what I asa referring to.

17

Q

Would that foe the same answer for Bayou?

18

A

1 imagine I would have to, yes.

19

I will confess that I,

like perhaps some others in

20

the court room, am confused about the feasible, workable,

21

reasonable tests, and I think we have to focus not on those

22

words which have been used in ways to make them so inherently

23

confusing, but on something else that relates to them, and

24

that ~~

25

Q

But 1 don't understand -- 1 gather that Green

23

1

used feasible* didn't they?

2

A

Yes.

3

Q

Where

does reasonable — I know reasonable

4

comes in the Court of Appeals in the Fourth Circuit,, but where

3

does reasonable or workable come from?

6

good enough?

?

A

S

Why isn't feasible

Workable was used in a concurring by Mr.

«Justice Harlan in the Certer case and ~~

9

Q

1 know* I reed your brief.

10

A

— in

the Fourth Circuit.

11

Q

But I

wondered —

12

A

1 think we ought to focus on something else.

13

These words* as they are being used* are getting us nowhere

14

and J. think w® ought to focus on one, the result to be

IS

achieved, and the result is the elimination of the all-black

18

school* and workability or whatever other word you use have to

17

be seen in that contact* and then the casting of the burden.

13

Q

1 thought we used feasible in the sense of an

19

alternative, if there were any alternatives to keeping it a

20

black school.

21

A

Yes —

22

Q

The schoolboard had

23

the duty ofemployinq one

of those alternatives to desegregate it.

24

A

Yes.

25

Q

Is that the sense
24

in which we used it?

1
2
<s»fc

A

1 think so. but 1 think it has to be also seen,
I

and'I think we use it in that sense also, in terms of the
burden.

If it appears that it can be done, there i3 a very

heavy burden on the board to establish that it cannot be done. ,J

I

13

Yes, and a considerably heavy burden.

23

said something it didn*t say.

"Gee, they are for racial balanceHand I was really

But it says what it was sup-

I
posed to say, that in a unitary school system no black student I
ij
may be assigned to a racially identifiable black school. I
25

i

1

think vie can explain it in considerable length that that does

2,

not mean racial balance and why.
As we understand the meaning

3

q£

racial balance, it

4

means that every school has to reflect approximately the per­

S

centage of students in the same ratio as the ratio in the

6

f

overall population.

In metropolitan Mobile, it would be 50-50,

7

in Charlotte it would be 71-29, and Mr. Chambers made it clear

8

yesterday ~~ and I am making it clear now -- that that is not

9

what we are arguing.

Our position is that the constitutional

10

obligation to disestablish a dual segregated system requires

11

at least that the resultant schools are ones which are not so

12

overwhelmingly black when considered as a total population of

33

that school district, that it is considered to be a black

14

school.
And we differ also from the government which use

15
16

the words "feasible" and "workable" as we have and that we

17

focus on results.

18

suggest that a most heavy burden is on the school board to

19

establish that a means to end segregation do not exist, that

20

a plan does not work.

21

think of the ten techniques they have used, if they pick any

22

two or three they could do it, and certainly if they used

23

all ten.

24

Justice Black's hypothesis, I would assume, is not workable,

25

and Bayou I i*ould assume is not workable.
j

We say, and the decisions of this Court

In Mobile it is workable, because I

Athens is workable and Charlotte is workable.

26

Mr.

1

But we have this ease here and I don't think vre have

a

to — it is difficult enough without considering all the cases

3

that we don't have here.

4

Q

Let me take you beyond this case.

Suppose

3

that that interstate were the boundary line between two school

6

districts, what then is the situation?

i

A

Well, actually that interstate is the boundary

s

between a number of school districts.

9

well, I hadn't thought of it that way, Mr. Justice Biackmun,

It is the boundary —

10

but it is a common school boundary for a large number of school

11

districts.

12

Well, they have moved school districts around all

13

over the place and I think they would just -- it was just one

14

way of doing it, not that they would have to reach the inter­

15

state barrier.

16

Actually the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare has

17

adopted-a plan called Alternative B-.1, and I want to have it

18

clearly understood that we are not urging Alternative B--1

19

upon the Court.

20

21

They might do a variety of other things.

Alternative B-l was conceded in the Court of
Appeals by the government to be a feasible plan.

I

It was dej

22

signed by HEW, was one of four plans that could work to de-

23

segregate Mobile.

24

they have not — this record is riddled with denials of

25

hearings, ess parte action, the facts have changed, and it is

1

We are not urging it upon the Court because

entirely possible that at this moment it work not be appropri­

thing which can do it and as a matter of fact --
