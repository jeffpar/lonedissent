ARGUMENT OF MALV1NE NATHANSON, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MISS NATHAN SON:
may xt please the Court.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
This case presents a question of

10

the application of the Fifth Amendment to a witness before a

n

grand jury proceeding.

12

The petitioner contends that the bribery conviction

13

which is presently being appealed was obtained in violation of

14

his privilege against self-incrimination and further in viola­

15

tion of his right to counsel under the federal Constitution.

16

In abdut March of 1964, the petitioner, with anothei

17

person, was arrested for an assault for which crime they were

18

subsequently convicted.

19

arraigned for this assault charge, they allegedly offered a

20

bribe to the arresting police officer,

21

to dispose of the "weapons in the case or to change his testi­

22

mony,

23

This bribe offer was fully reported to the District Attorney

24

in March of *64, they obtained a miniphone tape recording of

25

a conversation between the petitioner and the police officer,

On the same day that they were

to induce the officer

to reveal the names of other witnesses, and so on.

1

and all of this was in the hands of the District Attorney in

2

March of '64.

3

In March of '65, one year later, while petitioner

4

was serving his

S

which he had pleaded guilty, he was called before a grand jury

6

which was purportedly investigating the assault that had been

7

committed toy the petitioner and the conspiracies arising fchere-

the Fifth but was immediately offered immunity, was voted

immunity.

14

The petitioner never had a chance to plead

Immediately prior to his actual testimony, he request e(

15

to see his lawyer and he was assured by the District Attorney

18

conducting the investigation that he had nothing to worry

17

about, he was being fully protected, he didn’t need a lawyer

18

at all.

19

And so he testified.
Four days later the District Attorney had the police

20

officer to whom the bribe was offered come in and testify be­

21

fore the grand jury and several months later the petitioner,

22

who had been told that he was being fully protected, was in­

23

dicted for bribery.

24

is presently on appeal.

25

The bribery conviction is the case that

And during the course of petitioner's grand jury

munity, he was as iced to testify about the particular facts

There was, I might point out, no eye-witness to this assault.

io

The only diret evidence of the assault itself would have to

ii

come either from the victim of the assault or from the peti­

12

tioner and his co-defendant.

13

The police officer was also asked about the assault

14

and was particularly asked about what petitioner had told him

15

about the facts of the assault, and the police officer's

16

version of what the petitioner told him jibed very, very

17

closely with what the petitioner had testified to.

18

turns out, the petitioner had described all of these events to

19

the police officer during the course of making the bribe offer

20

for which the petitioner was indicted.

21

Wow, as it

Now, it is our position that force of the grand jury

22

actually relied upon or probably relied upon the petitioner’s

23

testimony when they decided to indict him for bribery.

24

secondly our position that the petitioner should have been

25

protected from indictment for bribery because under the
4

it is

1

Constitution, since he had been compelled to testify to matters

2

relevant to bribery, he had to be given protection from such a

3

prosecution, and it is further our position that the petitioner

4

was deprived of his right to consult with an attorney before

5

he testified and as a result the indictment that was obtained

6

must be dismissed.

7

We submit that the grand jury in fact actually re­

8

lied upon the petitioner's testimony,

9

testimony as a basis for indicting in several respects.

used the petitioner's
First

10

of all, the petitioner's testimony supplied the grand jury

II

with the motive for the bribe offer to which the officer would

12

later testify.

13

motive may not be a necessary element of the crime of bribery,

M

it certainly is easier to get a conviction, and we submit

15

easier to get an indictment if the prosecuting agency is aware

16

of the existence of a motive.

17

admission that he had committed the assault and that he had

18

committed the assault with the weapons that the police officer

19

later said he was supposed to dispose of in some way, we think

20

was crucial in this case and there was a strong likelihood

2!

that the decision whether or not to indict was in fact based

22

upon the grand jury's knowledge that there was a strong motive

23

for bribery in this case.

24
25

And, although as we have stated in our brief,

And so that the petitioner's

have to believe the police officer.

4

and so all that he could testify to really was what the peti­

5

tioner told him,

6

the police officer, and we thinlc the fact that the petitioner's

testimony supported the police officer's testimony in many

respects,they also led to the grand jury decision that in fact

No, Your Honor, but where the witness* testi­

factors which not only in this case was the defendant in fact,

the petitioner in fact testified to the same matter that the

patrolman later testified to and that formed the subject matter

25

of the indictment, but in addition the grand jury may have

indictment* but I believe it is another factor in the context

of this case which should be considered.

Court of Appeals at that time, seven months after their deci­

4G

sion in this ease, overruled this case insofar as it has set

II

down certain general legal principles.

12

that they had taken another look at the record; what they said

13

was this is not to say we have decided Piecirillo incorrectly,

14

because in fact in Piecirillo the legal test that we are set­

ting down now would not absolve him of this conviction.

16

However, they stated

There certainly is no question but that there would

17

be —- that this Court of Appeals has in fact considered

18

Piecirillo in light of its subsequent decision in

19

of Gold vs. Menna, which I assume you were alluding to, and

20

has reaffirmed its decision in Piecirillo as to the results.

21

They have again found that Mr. Piccirillo’s rights under the

22

Fifth Amendment were not violated.

!

Now, it is our position that the subsequent decision;

24

by the Court of Appeals which purports to adopt what we say

25

is federal constitutional rule, really does not more than pay10

lip service to that federal constitutional rule.

I think this

is demonstrated by the way they apply that rule in this case.

A

Without a chance to actually analyse the testi­

2

mony, because I think it all depends on exactly what it is he

3

testifies to and is it substantially related to the crime for

4

which he is being prosecuted, and to foe perfectly honest I

5

would have to sit down, read his testimony, take a look at the

6

facts of the crime and determine whether or not there is a

7

substantial relation in these hypotheticaIs 1 haven81 previ-

8

ously considered.

9

after analysis it would foe determine that the testimony that

10
11

he gave was substantially related to the beating up of the
children, then it certainly would be covered.
Q

12
13

But this would foe the test, and if

Pretty substantially related, isn't it, if it

the subsequent crime, and if

covered under the transactional immunity standard.

7

kind of creates the same kind of relevancy.

.

11

So we feel that there was no question but that there was a

\z

substantial relationship and that under the transactional iai-

13

munity test, which we contend is a federal constitutional

14

test, end as It has been explained by this Court in Heike and

15

applied in other cases, the bribery indictment must be found

15

to have been covered by the transaction immunity to which

r/

this petitioner was entitled.

J
!

!

18

It is finally our contention that the petitioner's

19

right to counsel was very seriously abrogated in this case.

20

As I mentioned before, prior to his giving any testimony, he

21

asked if he could speak to his lawyer, and he was told by the

22

~~ he stated that he would like to speak to his lawyer first

23

-— and he was told by the District Attorney, who was in

24

charge of the case, that this would not be necessary.

2S

In effect, what Mr. Pansarella told him after he
15

s

1

asked for his lawyer, he said under these circumstances you

2

are not a defendant* you are a witness — this is at page 7

3

of my brief «•» you have been given immunity.

That means you
|

4

cannot be prosecuted»

5

there is no reason for your conferring with your attorney.

Your rights are fully protected and

Now* of course, as I pointed out* the man was in­

8

7

dicted by the same grand jury several months later, and I

8

think there is at least a very serious question whether some
' - >•.

Q

of his rights were being affected during this grand jury pro­

10

ceeding and perhaps the advice of counsel might have been

n

helpful to him.
At the very least, counsel might have clarified for j

12
13

him what this immunity they were talking about was about.

14

the question Mr, Blaekmun, Mr. Justice Blackmun points out,

15

there is somewhat of a problem or has been somewhat of a

18

problem in Sew York State as to what the immunity standards

17

should be.

18

1

As

To compare this case with the subsequently decided

19

case of Matter of Gold vs. Menna, the advice given by the

20

District Attorney himself, his definition of what the immunity

21

would be kind of veers between a testimonial standard and the

22

transactional immunity standard.

23

We also submit that counsel could have been im­

24

portant perhaps even in negotiating an additional amount of

25

immunity for his client, which is certainly a perfectly
16

1

appropriate role of counsel, if counsel can accomplish this

2

sort of thing.

statements of the police officer, the lawyer for the petitioned

the briber offer.

clarified whether or not the District Attorney thought that

this bribe offer was being covered fey this offer of immunity.

And if in fact it was not toeing covered, petitioner may just

not want to have given up his privilege.

his perfect right to do.

And so'it is our position that for the three reasons,
the fact that his testimony, his compelled testimony,

in fact,

10

was used in obtaining an indictment, the fact that he should

have been given an immunity that would cover the bribery

prosecution under the transactional immunity standard,

that the conviction in this case be reversed.

If the Court please, Mr. Chief Justice,

into the discussion of the law.

That's true.

13

Q

Well, wouldn't you be in better shape if this

14

had been presented to one of the other ones?
A

15

Your Honor, there is no doubt about that and.

16

looking at it from the standpoint of hindsight, practically

17

speaking, that would have been a better procedure.

18

the question here is whether the procedure violated the con­

19

stitutional requirements and, with Your Honor's permission, I

20

would prefer to wait and discuss that point after the first

21

point.

22

However,

Second, I think it is important to place the facts

23

of what happened here in their proper perspective.

so in March 1965 the witness was called back and was given

statute.

The statutes are reprinted in both petitioner's and

10

respondent's briefs.

That statute protects the witness from

11

the use of his testimony, plus leads and the statute also

12

gives him. transactional immunity regarding any matter or

13

thing concerning which he testifies.
Now, that is clear.

14

The Court of Appeals in this

15

case decided if analying Counselraan vs. Hifcchcok, the Murphy

16

case, and all of the other relevant decisions, that the only

17

thing that the Constitution requires is that a witness be

18

given use-plus fruits immunity, and that the transactional

19

portion of the New York statute was not mandated by the

20

federal Constitution.

2!

Then- the court concluded that the New York statute

22

was passed because of the dicta in Counselman and that it

23

really was the intention of the legislature to give a witness

24

no more than the Constitution would require it go give any

25

witness.

And so the court held that the New York statute only
21

1

prevented the use of his testimony plus fruits or leaves.

2

Then seven months later the court overruled this case, but only

3

to the extent of its interpretation of the second portion of

4

the Sew York statute.

5

In other words* it said we were right* we still be­

6

lieve that the Constitution only requires a use plus fruits

7

immunity, however the New York statute is clear and there

8

really has never been any doubt, and we must interpret the

9

statute according to its plain language,

and so we hold that

10

the New York statute does give transactional immunity although

11

it is not required by the federal Constitution.

12

Now, this is important --

19

even argue this point, and so we were quite surprised when

21

the court decided that the New York statute as a matter of

22

state law was not an immunity statute.

23

felt that they had misinterpreted the statute.

24

is clear,

Q

Do I understand you, when you argued Piccirilld' s

case* this point was not argued before the state court?

A

That8s right, because we ail assumed that the

3

Blew York statute granted transactional immunity as a matter

4

of state law.

5

important for this reason:

6

first let me say this:

7

Mow, X think that is very important, and it is

Thenhe

If transactional immunity — well,

was brought in to the grand jurh in ’65 and

8

questioned about the events leading up to the assault, and

8

there is a lot of testimony.

He was asked many, many questions

10

But as a matter of introduction, of course, the testimony

11

started off by the prosecutor saying to him, now, you have

12

been convicted of assault and you are serving a sentence for

13

it, and isn't it true that this assault occurred on such and

14

such a date where you hit this man with a tire iron, and the

IS

-words !itire iron" were mentioned.

16

Mow, it was argued that by use of the word "tire

17

iron" that the defendant got immunity from prosecution for

18

the bribery because when he made the bribe offer to the

19

officer he said -- he offered him money in exchange for chang­

20

ing his testimony and losing the tire iron.

21

ment was made that because the phrase or the two words "tire

22

iron" was used in the grand jury, that this meant that the

23

defendant testified to a thing or matter as set forth in the

24

Mew York statute.

as

And so the argu­

Mow, if transactional immunity is required by —
23

1

and * incidentally, the court foe low, all the way down the line

2

held as a matter of fact that this was not a thing testified

3

to and that the testimony he gave had no relation as a matter

4

of fact to the testimony which supported the indictment.

3

is important because if transactional immunity i.s required by

0

the federal Constitution* then the decision of the Court of

1

Appeals that this was or wasn't a thing as specified in the

8

New York State statute, is a matter of federal importance,

9

and it is to foe decided fov a. uniform standard.

10

This

On the other hand, if the only thing that the Con­

11

stitution requires is a use plus fruits immunity, then when

12

Hew York decided whether this crime, this bribery was one of

13

the things testified to in the grand jury, becomes strictly a

14

matter of the state interpretation of its own statute, and

IS

there is no federal constitutional question involved.

16

And so it is necessary to decide whether transac­

17

tional immunity is required by the federal Constitution.

18

the pefcitioner relies a great deal on the case of Counselman

19

vs. Hitchcock.

20

Hitchcock is not the law any more, that it has been over­

21

ruled, or if it hasn't.,, it should be, afld that the consequences

22

of the holding In Counselman are much greater and dangerous

23

today than they were in the days when it was decided.

24
25

Now,

Now, it is our position that Counselman vs.

We also take the position that the Murphy vs.
Waterfront Commission case and Malloy vs. Hogan have closed
24

$u

this question and that this Court has made it clear that the

2

Constitution only requires a witness to be put in the same

3

position as if he had pleaded his privilege or as if he had

4

never testified.

S

tection that the Constitution gives him,.

6

use by any government of the testimony he gives and the leads

7

obtained from or the fruits of that testimony would do that.

8

To give1 him transactional protection is to give him a benefit

9

not required by the Constitution, and it is a benefit which

12

Wow, this is really the Key issue in this case,

13

and I think that there really is not much doubt about the law

S4

in this area.

15

constitutional rule to be that a state witness may not be

16

compelled to give testimony which may be incriminating under

17

federal law unless the compelled testimony and its fruits

18

cannot be used in any manner by federal officials in connec­

19

tion with the criminal prosecution against him.

20

This Court, in Murphy, said that we hold the

We conclude moreover that in order to implement

21

this constitutional rule and accommodate the interests of

22

the state and federal governments in investigating arid pro­

23

secuting crime, the federal government must be prohibited from

24

making any such use of compelled testimony and its fruits.

25

This exclusionary rule, while permitting the states
25

1

to secure information necessary for effective law enforcement,

2

leaves the witness and the federal government in substantially

3

the same position as if the witness had claimed his privilege

4

in the absence of the state granted immunity.

5

And then footnote 18 in that decision made it clear

6

as far as the rationale was concerned that this Court was only

7

saying that use plus fruits was required.

8

indicates that once a defendant had been granted immunity and

9

compelled to testify in a state proceeding, and then he was

II

up to the federal government to show that the source of the

12

evidence used against him was untainted and did not in any

13

way stem from the evidence he gave before a state grand jury,

14

which indicated that each government would be free to prose­

IS

cute or obtain indictments against a witness provided they

16

were totally, completely independent.

17

And this I submit would foe the same situation that

13

a witness would find himself in if he never were a witness,

19

if he were never compelled to testify.

2©

to a witness, tell us things, give us information which we

21

intend to use against other people, sort of off the record,

22

we are not going to use it against you, use it in any way to

23

obtain evidence against you -- but, on the other hand, if

24

something comes up, clearly from an independent source, we do

not want to be prohibited from doing what we normally could do.

Now, the statement In Counselman which caused all

the problems was dicta in that decision.

clared a federal statute unconstitutional because in that case,

4

as a matter of fact, that statute only gave use immunity and

5

did not protect Mr. Counselman from the federal government*s

6

using the fruits of his testimony or obtaining leads from his

7

testimony, and for that reason, and that reason alone, the

8

statute was unconstitutional.

13

Court of the State of New Jersey’s opinion in the Zicarelli

14

ease, which: I submit is highly persuasive.

15

Now, this was pointed out in the Murphy case, in

Also I would like to point out that the effect of

16

the decision in Counselman was not very great because you had

17

the two sovereignties doctrine, and it really made no differ­

m

ence what the court said in that case because the Fifth

19

Amendment could not be pleaded in a state prosecution and,

20

vice versa, the opposite was true.

21

However, since this Court's decision in Malloy vs.

22

Hogan, applying this amendment to the states, the Fifth

23

Amendment, has- come down, a holding such as petitioner sug­

24

gests, requires

25

Counselman requires,, would have disastrous

effects on law enforcement throughout the United States.
\
21

And

1

I suggest that if the bases for Copnselman and the conditions

2

under which it was decided no longer exist, then Counselmam

3

should be reevaluated.
Now, many courts have considered this problem and

4
S

have taken the position that this Court has overruled

6

Counselman, even though it didn't specifically say so in the

7

Murphy decision.

For instance, in New Jersey, in the

munity, this statute was enacted after Murphy was decided,

and so the legislature took the position that this Court had

12

overruled Counselman and the state was now free to take away

1.3

the transactional portion of the protection it had previously

14

afforded witnesses.
And so it passed a new statute, and the statute was

a very impressive compilation at the end of her brief or in

the appendix of all of the fifty states in which it is clear

4

that most of the states have adopted transactional immunity

statutes, and apparently this is done to argue that if the

6

states felt it was necessary to give that type of protection,

1

then it ought to be persuasive and this Court ought to be

8

persuaded that it 'too should take the same position»

9

1 would like to point out, as 1 point out in my

10

brief, that prior to Counselraan the situation was just the op­

11

posite.

12

but because of the dicta in Counselraan it was thought that

13

transactional immunity was now required as a federal propo­

14

sition and all of the states amended their statutes.

transactional immunity, bound the federal government, then the

effect is even worse because if that were true a state, of

course, without consultation *with the federal government or

the only argument is made that we used the

testimony of this witness against him on the Broderick csss,

Now the record,,

I think,

dispels that argument.

First, it is conceded that motive under New York law is not an

think that merely using the same grand jury does not in and of

the attorney could have done nothing more for Piccirillo than

receive.

ARGUMENT Of MALVINE NATEANSON, ESQ.,

4

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER — REBUTTAL

5

MISS NATHAHSOH:

On this question of the effect of

6

the rule that we

7

criminal prosecutions throughout the entire country, first I

8

believe the District Attorney has misinterpreted what we state

9

is constitutionally required.

state is constitutionally required upon

10

The Counselxnan rule, as we have discussed it in our

11

brief, refers to the requirement that the compelling jurisdic­

12

tion— the compelling jurisdiction grants transactional

13

immunity to the witness.

14

it was a case where the compelling jurisdiction in the using

15

jurisdiction, of potentially using jurisdiction, were two

16

different places.

17

that distinction is very important.

That is not the situation in this case, but

18

We have not -»

19

Q

20
21

In the Murphy situation, of course,

How is it important to the use factor?

Would

you spell that out?
A

Well, we have not proposed that a jurisdiction

other than the one which has compelled the testimony be

22
f
23

bound by the transactional immunity rule, so we have not pro­

24

posed this parade of horrors that the District Attorney refers

2S

to when some small state prosecution will insulate a witness
36

1

from large important federal prosecutions,

2

we are saying at all.

3

tion which makes the decision whether or not to compel the

4

testimony and presumably evaluates so far as its own jurisdic­

3

tion is concerned how important the testimony is or how im­

6

portant that prosecution against that witness would be.

This is not what

It is our position that the jurisdic­

That

V

7

jurisdiction which makes a definite decision to grant immunity

8

should be bound by that decision.

9
10

Q

And must grant transactional immunity from any

prosecutions by that jurisdiction?

!1

A

By that jurisdiction.

But the jurisdiction

12

which has not participated in this decision would not be

13

bound to that extent as to that jurisdiction in the Murphy

14

rule* which says protection against from using fruits would

15

be the proper rule to apply.
Q

16

Why does it need to go beyond use?

Let'!s lay

27

aside Counselsan and the others* what is your rationale for

18

it?

19

A

It is our position that

well, a man who has

20

in fact been forced to testify can never be placed in the

n

exact same spot as though he had never testified* and this is

2Z

a fact that has occurred and there is no way of pretending

23

that it never happened.

24

to that point in time when he was not compelled to testify*

25

we submit that the only thing you can do is give him full

But to get him as close as possible

37

1

protection for this reason:

2

If he is only given protection against the use of

3

his testimony or his fruits -- first of all, this involves

4

very, very difficult factual evidentiary kind of a hearing --

3

even assuming that the burden would be on the prosecuting

6

agency, as it ms mentioned, it would be in Murphy, it is

7

still a difficult factual question because it almost involves

S

the exploration into the thought process of the prosecuting

9

agency, and we are assuming that this is the same agency that

10

has compelled the jurisdiction.

We can further assume that

1!

they are aware of the compelled testify.
You would have to go into their minds and find out

12
13

whether their testimony set off any trains of thought, gave

14

them any ideas, gave them any hunches that they acted upon.

IS

These are very, very difficult things to trace, and I don't

16

believe that you could ever have assurance that there would be

17

full protection,
Q

18
19

All of those factors are still there when you

have the federal-state situation, on the fruits problem.

2©

A

Well —

2!

Q

What you are arguing against is the fruits

A

This is true except for the fact that you are

22
23

problems.

24

dealing with two different jurisdictions, and the likelihood

25

well, for-example, in this case, there is very little
38

1

chance that the District Attorney of Kings County was not aware

2

of the petitioner’s testimony.

3

tion, it would not be as likely that the federal authorities

4

would know what he had said, and so you wouldn't have this

S

difficult problem of determining haw the other state, how his

6

investigation or procedure may have been somehow determined

7

by what he heard, because it is not so clear that he was privy

8

to the compelled testimony.

8

If there was federal prosecu­

Certainly within a jurisdiction this is a much, much

10

greater problem, and we concede that because of certain prac­

11

tical considerations involved in our federal system, it may

12

be that the rule would have to be different between the two

13

jurisdictions, although it is not easy to formulate the

14

rationale apart from just saving that without some kind of

15

differing standards the problems the District Attorney has

16

presented might in fact come into being.

17

We do live in a federal system and, as Murphy recog­

18

nised, we have to make accommodations between federal and state

19

interests, and we submit that this is the best way of doing it

20

within the framework of the Constitution.

21

It is interesting that in Murphy they stated that

22

the witness who was being protected from use of his testimony

23

was being placed in substantially the same position, substan­

24

tially as though he had not testified, which is something dif­

25

ferent from what Counselman said, which is that he must be in
39

1

es^actly the same position as though he had not testified.

2

Z think this is a recognition that this isn't really com­

3

pletely as the Constitution would require, but because it is

4

not the compelling jurisdiction and because of our federal

5

system this would be a proper rule under the Constitution.
If I could just make one more comment, I would

6
7

like to point out that these questions do not appear in this

0

case,

9

jurisdiction being the very same on® -that has embarked upon

I again stress that we are dealing with the compelling

10

the prosecution and so under the transactional immunity test,

11

as we believe it is evident from the decisions of this Court

12

and the Constitution, the indictment in this ease must neces­

13

sarily be dismissed.

14

Thank you.
