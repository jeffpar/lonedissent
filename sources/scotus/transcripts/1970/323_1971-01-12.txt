ORAL ARGUMENT BY ARCHIBALD COX, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. COX;

1
8
9
10

IS
12

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court s
This is a first degree murder case here in forma
pauperis on certiorari to the Supreme Court of New Hampshire.
Two constitutional questions are presented.
The first is whether a search warrant issued by

13

the Attorney General of the State# upon the unsworn reports,,

14

oral reports ©f his subordinates while he is active charge of

15

a criminal investigation and when he will actually himself,

16

lead the prosecution, is a valid search warrant for the pur­

1?

poses of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments»

18

Of course we submit that it plainly is not.

19

The second question, which relates t© an entirely

20

different incident so that we may win ©a either grounds? the

21

second question is whether a wife8 a acquiescence in the taking

22

of her husband’s personal belongings, would validate what

23

otherwise is an otherwise unconstitutional search and seizure,

24

in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, this

25

being a state case.

*
f2

t
2

These two questions are better understood if I
outline the salient points concerning the case.

3

On January 13, 1964, a young girls Pamela Mason,

4

left her house in Manchester, Mew Hampshire on a babysitting

5

assignment»

6

found by the side of the principal interstate Highway'leading

7

south*

8

9

She disappeared? eight days later her body was

The state’s theory later became that she had been
shot by a „22 caliber Mossberg rifle? also her throat had been j

10

out with a knife and that the body had been dumped there

11

about 9:00 o’clock or 9:30 perhaps that same evening when it

12

was covered by an unusually heavy snowstorm, and then after a

13

rainstorm eight days later, became visible»
This was a disappearance and crime which excited

14
15

enormous attention in Manchester and indeed, through the State

16

of Mew Hampshire.

17

for people to some foward with the names of anyone who was

18

out ©£ the house that evening and eventually one of Petitionersi

19

neighbors reported t© the police that he had been out of his

20

house that night.

21

the police? two of them, and questioned him about his where­

22

abouts

23

later turned out to be false.

24
25

At the time the police broadcast appeals

And they went to the house on January 28th,

He gave an explanation which, unfortunately for him,

H® also shewed the police some guns he had in the
house at that time and spoke t© them very freely and they asked
r

1

him if he would be willing to g© to Concord to the headquarters

z

of the State Police to fake a lie detector test and he said

3

that he would, but since he was working as a bakery truck

4

driver, asked that it be on his day ©ffs Sunday®

5

Then on Sunday, February 2nd, they did indeed to

6

up to the state police headquarters and he took the lie

7

detector test, which produced affirmative information of his

8

guilt®

9

a small sum of money from his employer,.

But, at that time he did admit that ha had. erabazsled

When they went back to Manchester he was questioned

10

n

late into the night by 'the police and he was not actually

12

arrested in a formal sense until after midnight, but the trial

13

judge found that he would not be permitted to leave at any

14

tin® after they had returned from Concord®
The first search and seizure ©£ which we complain

IS
16

occurred on that day, February 2nd while Petitioner was in

17

custody at the Manchester police station®

18

officers who had never been to his house before, went to his

19

house and with the acquiescence of his wife, E4r®„ Coolidge,

20

obtained his guns and clothing and took them away.

.21

22
23

Two different

Q

Are these the same guns that the police, had

A

These were the same guns that different

seen before?

24

police had seen before and there is no indication that these

25

two men had any information about what had happened before®

4

1

9

Did the wife at this time know that her

2

husband was at least in the company of police arid had been for

3

a considerable time?

4

A

Yes, she did and I thought it would be con­

5

venienti, Mr. Chief Justice, to — I'm going to argue the

6

question about the Attorney General's warrant first, and 1

7

thought it might be convenient if I refrained from stating the

3

fasts about this search which took place chronologically first

S

until I, corae to what will be the second branch of my argument,

10

and then I will address myself to the specific questions that

11

you mentioned»
The second, as 1 say, Petitioner was held at the

12

13

police station»

He was held overnight on this larceny charge

14

and then he was released on his own recognizance but he was

m

not a prisoner during the ensuing weeks»
The second search and seizure occurred some weeks

16
17

later on February IS, which is almost three weeks after the

18

first,»

39

of the investigation and prosecution, had called a conference

20

in his office in Concord for the purpose of reviewing the

21

evidence that had erstwhile been developed»

22

presents representatives of the Manchester police and the

23

state police and two assistant attorneys general»

Attorney General Maynard, who had taken active charge

Those officers presented to him what their in­

24

25

There were

vestigation

had revealed and presenting it, the trial judge

5

!

explicitly found to him in his capacity as the chief prosecu­

2

ting. officer of the State ©f New Hampshireo
Q

3
4

Mr. Cose, incidentally * is there a transcript

of whafe took place at that meeting in the AG's office?
A

5

Nos there was no record made of that and none

6

of what was said was under oath.

And Police Chief McGranaghan

7

did testify during the trial on voir dire* concerning what

8

took place* but there was no record as as I say* it was not

9

under oath.

This was just* 1 think quite genuinely some ~

10

with the chief investigator and later prosecutor* what they

11

had been able to develop.

12

Then* at the end of that conference* after about

13

two hours* we know from Chief McGranaghan8s description* he

14

asked for an arrest warrant and four search warrants against

15

the Petitioner* and the Attorney General* having a commission

16

as Justice of the Peace* took Chief McGranaghan0a oath to the

17

complaint and then he* himself* issued the five warrants* none

18

of which we are concerned with heres the warrant for an old

19

Pontiac automobile —

'20

21

22

Q

Does the attorney general ordinarily.have -a

commission, as Justice of the Peace in New Hampshire?
A

I don't

1 know that Mr. Maynard did.

others did.

I

23

suspect that

New Hampshire had an extraordinary

.24

practice at this time.

25

never went out ©f the police department to get a search warrant

Chief McGranaghan testified that they

6

!

they just had the inspectors, captains, all commissioner

2

Justices of the Pease.

3

not

4

today because the statute has been changed, but" it was, as X

5

said, the practice at this time.

6

stance, apparently.

He testified to this *

1 don't want to overstate it»

7

That evening —

8

Q

9

And that is

That is not the practice

This wasn't an odd happen»

Mr. Cox,'do X understand that that there is

no challenge fc© Mr. Cooiidgees arrest here?
A

10

X don't think

it makes any difference her®.

11

There was a challenge to Mr. CooiidgeSs arrest.

12

clear in the headings feo Petitioner's brief in the New Hampshiz s

13

Supreme Court that they challenged the arrest warrants on the

14

same grounds as the search warrants.

IS

letterhead things, but as fax as X can it does not make any

16

difference t© our contention in this case.
Q

17
18

It's very

It's one of the black

Both facets of your argument, your entire

argument, ©f course in this case, depends upon the continuing
|

19

validity ©f the exlnsionary rulesV doesn't it?

20

A

Zi

That evening Petitioner was arrested in his house

22
23
24

25

Oh, yes.

X assume that and »» if 1 may.

pursuant to the arrest warrant and it was an hour and a half or
two hours later that the Pontiac ear was towed to the police
station and it was searched 'the next day and then again a year
later.

1

The search is important without going into the

1

2

details, because in the course of vacuuming the car the police

3

came to tiny particles -that were later examined under a

4

microscope which experts sought to associate with particles

5

that they said were substantially similari, taken from the

6

clothes of this unfortunate girl*
And the expert testimony was that there was soma

1
8

extraordinarily high degree of probability that t he body must

9

have been in the car»

This* 1 would say? this evidence which

10

the court first refused to suppress ©n our motion before

11

trial? and which was admitted over our objection? pressed all

12

the way through the trial in that appeal? was not essential

13

to the prosecution of the case*

14

where you could say that: this was harmless error within this

'IS

courts s rules.

It was not conceivably a case

Indeed? the Supreme Court of New Hampshire noted

16
1?

thro® or four ©r five times the very dubious character ©f the

10

evidence against — ©f 'the proof against the Petitioner in this

19

case.

20

weakness®"

21

doubt on the state's theory and how further doubts were cast

22

by certain other evidence? and how the ballistics evidence

23

blew up? to put it colloquially in the state's face during the

24

trial.

25

On 265 it says "the proof was not wholly free from
Then it speaks of how the limitations of time east

So that this? I think — I'm simply emphasising the
8

!

importance of this question

£

Now, our first contention here is basically a very

3

simple; one —

4

Q

Well, does it make any difference to your

5

case whether the evidence obtained in this way was weak

6

evidence or strong evidence?
A

7

No? I was simply negating any possibility

8

if tine rule ~ there was a case decided the same day in — in

9

California,

10

1 can't think of the name of it now, that could

be applicable here.

That is that it was harmless error,

I think that isn't true and 1 do emphasise that

If
12

this was a very close

case on the trial so that this evidence

13

was important to the press, too.
Now, first ray primary contention, as I say, is

U

IS

that the admission of evidence obtained under the search

16

■warrant, violated the Petitioner's constitutional rights

27

because the warrant which is issued by the chief prosecutor

18

instead of a neutral and detached magistrate.
And 1 need hardly remind the court that it has

39
20

said over

21

States, Mr, Justice Jackson's ©pinion, that ©n© of the indis­

22

pensable conditions t© a valid warrant; is that the infe'EOBQSS

23

from the facts which lead to the complaint are drawn by a

24

neutral and detached magistrate instead of being judged by the

25

and over again since Johnson against the United

officer sag caged in the often competitive enterprise of ferrsfcin

s

The closest case, unquestionably, is Mancusi

3

against De Forte, where the court dealt with a subpoena duces

4

tecum that had. been issued by the district attorney in New

5

York and Justice Harlan, in writing the opinion, considered

6

whether the evidence would have been admissible if the sub™

7

poena could foe treated as a search warranto

8

and there was no dissent on that point in the court, because

9

the district attorney was not a detached and neutral officer„

And he said no?

Now, the state replies that Attorney General

10

11

Maynard, before he signed the warrant, took off, his black

IE

prosecutorial hat and put on his white Justice o£ the Peace

hat.

Well, do you challenge the existence of

A

As a scatter ©f

We don't argue that? it has been argued in

Q

11

Would you say that the invalid warrant would

have prevented the police, who had probable cause, t© search

.13

the Pontiac,that the invalid warrant would have prevented

14

them from searching it if they had found it in motion on the

15

highway?

16

A

Well, I would raise the question and do

17

raise the question ©fi whether th©-police rely on the warrant,

18

and they do not assert any exigent circumstances, that that

19

matter is really not looked into in the court below»

But» 1 think the burden» generally speaking,

Now, if you got the ear going, carrying contra­

band with somebody who was engaged in that you would have some

3

reason to think you should act quick,,

4

in all candor«, and no way if you say —

S

Q

But 1 see no reason,

Mr. Cox, when you stop the

car on the high­

6

way after ites in motion why you could always immobilize it

7

and wait for a warrant.

8
9

A

Well, yes? and of course that is what divided

the court in changing its mind.

But at least there one was

10

able to say that, well, what8s the difference between searching

11

it then and there and taking it down to the police station and

12

searching it later at the police station.

13

anything turn on the fact that this car was not searched until

14

the next day, ©r until a year later.

15

I disc:l»ii«;i any evidence on that.

16

Ism not making

1 make nothing of that.

2 make a great deal of the fact that this was not

17

incident to the arrest because the Petitioner had been

18

arrested an hour-and-a~half or two hours earlier*and was in

19

custody at the time and I make a great deal 'of the fast that

20

if the car was not stopped under circumstances indicated, that

21

if you took time to get a warrant you might miss your chance

22

to stop it and search it.

23

Q

24
25

But, the car itself was subject to one ©f

these search warrants.
A

The car was described as a container of the
13

things that were in the trunk.

Yes.

It was not described as the object of

7

oversimplifying it most dramatically •— I don’t see th® dif­

8

ference between searching for this object in a car parked in

9

Your Honor told it in Chambers and Monroney* not about some­

1 submit that once Your Honors stepped over this

Mr, Cox, did I understand pu to concede that

had this'application for a warrant been presented t© a clas­
sically neutral magistrate there —
A

4
15

I don't -- I'm rather skeptical

that part.

I said "that 1 didn't think I had to dispute

And I would point out, Mr, Chief Justice, that

from Certified Lumber (?) through Auguilar, this?’Court has
consistently held that the fact that you might, get; .a search

8

warrant the right way will not excise a search and seizure

9

mad® without a. warrant or -upon an invalid one.

20

And -the question here is clearly? if the police

.21

could justify by saying, well we could have gotten the warrant

22

the right way? we couldn't have gotten a neutral man to sign

23

it? in tli© first place there was a always & little bit of

24

uncertainty or speculation after the event, but in the second

25

place, the whole reason for the exclusionary rule would be
15

1

undermined because they would always come to court later arid

2

defend it if they could.

Mr, Cox? before you go t© February 2nd? may

She was? she was»

Q

And do X get an intimation from the record

that the police asked questions .and Mr. Coolidge showed him

5

guns and helped them inspect the car and agreed t© take the

A

7

8

He was entirely free and open in responding

and showing anything or responding t© anything they asked.

9

Q

Was she present, to©, at all times?

10

A

She was present.

X would simply say that

11

the circumstances had changed so much by February 2nd when he

12

was being held in custody and that neither she nor -the police

13

would be entitled to infer from his conduct then that he was

14

authorising her to make up his mind for him later.

When they arrived there the mother-in-law, the

Petitioner's mother, was there and they started to talk to

ments and the testimony is that she left at their request.

12

After the mother-in-law left, -the Petitioner's - s

wife discussed this with the two police officers who were

t^er®f, namely? about where the Petitioner had been on that

evening,

17

that at this point also they had no knowledge of what weapons

he had shown to the other two officers*.

of what particular weapon they were looking for,

her and told the Petitioner5a wife that they were examining

And one of the policeofficera said, "no,* and the other one

said "we might as well take them," which is consistent with

the finding of the court that they did not at that point know

what they were looking for»

As it turned out, later that evening and she

8

brought out not three, but four weapons, ©ne ©fwhich turned out

Later that evening at the police

10

station the other policaofficar who had bean " down at the

11

ballistic laboratory, returned about close t© midnight and

12

for the first time, at the time when they already had these

13

four weapons at the police station, they know that they are

looking for a .22 caliber Mossberg rifle»

15

that there9s one on the bench at the police station»

16

And he recognises

The evidence was that the Petitioner saw his

clothes and his guns at the. police station that evening and

18

in, fact, the next

19

to one ©f the police officers»

20

morning, offered to sell on® of the guns

And, it's1'within this factual background that the

21

Petitioner- raises the question of a search and seizure.

Th©

22

trial court ruled and 'the Mew Hampshire Supreme Court upheld

23

the ruling that, there was, under these facts and circumstances

24

no search and no seizure.

Z5

g© throughout the house.looking for anything.

There was no quest? they did not

38

In fact, it was

t

only at the offer of the wife that they took the rifles with

2

them and under these circumstances the contentiori of the

3

Respondent here is that there was no search and seizure and

4

if that8s the case, then there is no issue for this Court t©

S

pass upon and the ruling of the court below should b® upheld»

6

'
But, even assuming that there was a search or a

7

seizure, under the law it is the contention of ‘the Respondent

8

here that a wife has the authority to consent to a, voluntarily

9

consent t© a search and seizure of her home that she has

10
11

lawful control and possession of.
Q

And I think —

So, technically you think the situation here

12

is as though the wife had taken the guns out of the closet and

13

taken them down to the police station —

And handed them over»

“Here are ray husband8s guns."

Nov?, she may

not have authority fe@ do that, but you say that if the police' _
had taken them, there neverthe less would» 5t have bean any
search and seizure involved?
A

That is correct. Your Honor,and the fact that

she also made a statement that evening which 1 haven81 referred
to before, was — it's in the evidences ”We have nothing to

22
23

24
25

that happened four days earlier when the two other police
officers were there and the Petitioner himself brough out
weapons and showed them the car and answered all their question a

Q

Had he been arrested at that time?

5

A

He was not arrested until three weeks later.

6

He was not even a prime suspect in the case at that time,

7

because the police had nothing to go on at that point, other

8

than the fact that he was not home that evening.

9

until several weeks later that the weapon that was tested

It was not

was obtained that evening and indicated that it was the murder

weapon; that indicated to the police that he was the perpe­

12

trator of this crime.
Q

That's the weapon you say the wife gave to

15

A

Yes, Mr. Justice Black.

16

So that under those circumstances we say that

there was no search and seisure and there is no issue.
