ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR, van SPRINGER:

Mr Chief Justice and may it

This case which comes here on direct appeal from

©incarnation of the case of United against Armour and General

U

ost Corporation that was here a year ago but became moot
; efore the Court decided.

!

Like that case, it raises a question as to the

1%

rapact as to the structural prohibitions of the great Meat,

acker’s Anti-Trust Decree of 1920 to which Armour, one of the

1?

. ppellees here anomally, is one of the four meat packer parties,,

The General Host case began

Since

General Host was in the forbidden food lines the Government

t ok the position that thedecree was offended by General Host's

takeover of Armour* just as it would have been by the converse

situation.

in the beginning of 1969 in the District Court* which has had

continuing jurisdiction over the Meat Packers8 Decree for the

7

last ten or 12 years, but a transfer from the District of

8

Columbia, where a decree was initially entered.

9

So* we filed a petition then against General Host

At that time we asked the Court to enter an order

supplemental to the decree against General Host, which would

na ze General Host a party to Idle decree and then prohibit its

acquisition of Armour.

/ho is also the District Judge int he present case, declined

But, Judge Hoffman, the District Judge,

that therefore the relationship between Armour and General Host

mn perfectly consistent with the decree as long as it was
treated by somebody other than Armour, and as long as Armour
voided actively dealing in the forbidden food line.
The Government appealed the case here and it was

2!

rgued in March of 1970.

oirt could reach a decision in the General Host case, General

23

ost sold its controlling stock interest in Armour to Grey-

In mid-May last year, before; the

ou.nd Corporation, which is the Appellee in the present case.
Over our objection this Court then held that the

The papers that were filed in connection with that

Again we

this Court for probably jurisdiction, and here we

tre again.

The question in this case, as in the General Host
case, is whether an anti-trust decree can effectively keep a
vi

I arty to that decree from becoming involved in another line of
tusiness where it's involvements would, in the view of the

2

4

initial decree, create a risk to the competition.
Judge Hoffman held in each case that all a Court can
co in entering an anti-trust decree is to tell the parties not
.
to do anything itself that would have the effect of involving
in the forbidden business and, incidentally, the act can
pul ish anyone who actively aids or abets that party in doing
ihhat

the decree tells him not to do.
We say, on the other hand, that a structural anti-

trisfc decree can be somewhat more than that, that a Court can
effectively decree an absolute prophylactic situation between
a particular named party's business and another line of business and we say this Meat Packer’s Decree has done that and
that the court having jurisdiction over the decree can enter
a supplemental order fashioning a remedy against an outsider
Hi a Greyhound which comes in to destroy the structural
separation that we say is at the heart of the decree.
Just as in the school desegregation casas that we have
referred to in our brief, we think an anti-trust court has the
power to issue a narrow order directed at a particular third
■

-

party involved in a particular situation after a hearing that
will prohibit that party’s interference with the effectuation
of fie specific purpose at the heart of the decree in question.
With that introduction let me turn now to the descrip- ;
tici of the corporate relationships that Greyhound has created
between Armour and Greyhound’s forbidden fruit operations and

1

hen point once again, as I did last year, to the explicit

z

snguage of the decree that we think is designed specifically

its our theory of the case.

We think they are undisputed and ifc

f Armour in competition with General Host, but General Host
o.i out, winding up in early 1969 with about 57 percent of the
tuck but leaving Greyhound with something of ’the order of a
hird of the stock.

In the May 1970 transactions that I have

eferred to. Greyhound than sought out General Host, acquiring
11 of the stock that General Host had had, giving it then a
o :al of about 86 percent of all of the stock of Armour,
Q

Did that acquisition require approval of the

nzerstate Commerce Commission?
A

Yes, it did, Mr, Justice,

As we set forth in

< ul“ pleadings last term and we refer t© in our brief, Greyhound

;?

5lied an application with the Interstate Commerce Commission,
a he Government, though not a party there, filed a pleading in
shich we suggested that the Commission withhold its action
approving the issuance of the Greyhound stock involved in the
General Host transaction until this Court, should decide the
anti-trust case to determine whether this acquisition was legal
cr rot.
The Commission took the point of view that since the
•

•

Court has not reached a decision there was not yet anything
suggesting that the transaction was illegal.

And then from —

the XCCcs rather narrow focus, which of course does not deal
with the — the ICC's order does not deal with any anti-trust
!

questions at all, and of course it has no power to immunise
this kind of transaction.

The only real question there was

wiether the issuance of this additional stock by Greyhound
would be harmful to Greyhound's basic business as a common
I

c arrier.
So, the Commission did approve it, and within a
couple of hours after notice was given of that approval, this
transaction had been closed and Greyhound was the owner of
Armour.
Greyhound has made no secret of the fact — in fact
it stated again in its current annual report that it went into
Armour initially in 1969 with the encouragement of Armour9s

As vie understand it —G

You don't say that they did actually part­

icipate with Amour or anybody else? do you?

reyhound has been in active participation with Amour in
sing something in violation of the decree.

l&t way, and in a sense, of course, ites easier on Greyhound
lan calling Greyhound before the Court and suggesting that
; itself was in contempt.

The Government is — has a per-

icfcly adequate remedy to have an order against Greyhound
illing Greyhound to divest itself and then and only then
mid the Government proceed —
Q

That’s an easier way of doing it than going

directly against Greyhound?
A

Yes.

There are, I think, fewer questions t©

5 i argued about in that approach —

G

Well, assuming that it's easier for the

Internment; that doesn’t make it legal,, does it?
A

No, Mr. Justice, though 1 think if the

1 >vernment. could proceed directly against Greyhound 1 think it

8

would follow that it could proceed indirectly in thiswway.
1 think that, assuming that the Court agreed with that, the
< Government could say —even though we could seek contempt
punishment against Greyhound now we will give Greyhound another’

,
chance and we would like the Court to make clear what
Greyhound’s obligations are and then and only then would we
'

lroceed against them.
as we understand it, the Amour stock was initially
owned by a Greyhound subsidiary.

Subsequently at the end ©£

1970 Greyhound arranged a series ©£ transactions which resulted
first of all in the acquisition of all of the rest of — all ©f
the minority interests in Amour, giving Greyhound 100 percent
ownership and then a reorganization of the corporate structure
so that Armour is now a direct, fully-owned subsidiary of the
Greyhound Corporation, which we are told is the holding company
which owns Greyhound9s various interests, including its bus
lines. Armour, the food businesses that we find offensive to
the decree and various other lesser interests.
And Greyhound has moved with some rapidity to infce- :
grate Amour into its corporate family.

For example, the

currant annual report of Greyhound states, and I quotes

communications, insurance and banking arrangements, for

decree.

Paragraph four says that the meat packer defendants?

including Armour? are perpetually enjoined and restrained from
either directly or indirectly engaging in or carryisig on the
aiasauSapturihg job in

selling? transporting? distributing or

otherwise dealing in these forbidden food products.

And that

Berne paragraph goes on to say that the corporation defendants
are further perpetually enjoined and restrained from owning?
either directly or indirectly any capital stock or other in­
terests whatsoever in any corporation engaged in those for­
bidden businesses.

Paragraph 6 prohibits Amour from directly or in­
directly operating meat markets — retail meat markets and
paragraph 8 sf the'deers® has prohibitions

on dealing in fresh

milk and cream which are comparable to the other prohibitions isi
paragraph 4»

23
24

As w@ show in our brief? this Meat Packer’s Decree?
of course? is no mere historical relic.

25.

12

The packers have twice

1

asked the Court, this Court each time, to lower the prophylac­

2

tic structural barriers between the meat packing business and

3

'the other food businesses and each time the Court, including

4

this Court, has rejected their arguments that changed condi­

5

tions, replacement of the original officers and directors who

6

got Armour and the other packers into this in the first place,

1

and so forth, have justified changes in the decree.

8

decree has remained intact through all these years and it was

9

only II years — tan years ago that this Court last considered

10

the modification question.
As our is 8till the second largest member of the

11
12

13
14

So, the

meat packing industry and that is still a quite highly concen­
trated industry, although somewhat less so than it was in the
twenties.

15

As Justice Cardoso said in 1932 in the earlier

16

modification attempt: "Such great sise carries with it an

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

opportunity for abuse, which is not to be ignored when the
opportunity has proved to have been utilised in the past."
St was for that reason he said that the decree absolutely pro­
hibited the forbidden food line from being added to the meat
packing business.

And the underlying purpose of this structur­

al barrier was, again

in Justice Cardoso's words: "To avoid

the difficulty of ferreting out particular competitive evils
and repressing them when discovered."
In other words, I think the classic case of a
13

1

prophylactic kind of structural insulation of the parties to

2

the decree from other businesses where it was considered that

3

their involvement would risk anti-competitive effects.

4

think then it8a as clear as it could be that the specific and

5

primary purpose ©f the decree, both based on its own language

6

and on what this Court and the District Court has said over the]

7

years in interpreting its Amour was to be kept in perpetuity

8

out of the food lines in which Greyhound, through its sister

9

subsidiary of Armours Food Managements is involved.

I

1

And this

10

specific prohibition is what we say the acquisition ©£ Armour

11

by Greyhound has interfered with.
As 1 indicated , they are now sister subsidiaries of

forth.

so

They ar® obviously common servants of a single owners

Greyhound, or if you will, the stockholders of Greyhound, every
bit as much, we think, in practical terms, as if Armour had
acquired Food Management, ©r if Greyhound now, as it obviously
could, war® t© merge the two ©f them and perhaps ©parate them
as divisions of a single corporation.,

I think ifcss uncontested

that both of those particular situations would be literally
prohibited by the decree.
Moreover, 1 think it's dear that Armour could not
have created a holding company itself which would own its stock
and then would have acquired a company such as Food Management,

14

1

but of course that corporat® relationship is the precise cor™

2

porate relationship that now exists by virtue ©£ Greyhound's

3

acquisition and rearrangement of these corporate structuresQ

4

So, again, the same economic unity the same corporate family,

5

is in the two businesses and we say that the decree was plainly

8

specifically designed to prevent that exact situation as to

7

Armour, from coming into being without regard, we say, to who

3

was active and who was passive in creating the situation.
In fact, wa think it can be said that the situation

15
16
17
18

19

21

24
25

created by Greyhound with respect t© Amour, puts Armour in a
position where it can be said t© be in literal violation of the
decree.

As I indicateds paragraph 4th ©f the decree notonly

prohibits Armour fro® directly ©r indirectly engaging in the
business in which Food Management is involved? it also pro\

hibits Armour from owning any interest whatsoever in any com™
pany that is engaged in such & business as Food Management, we
think plainly is.
We think that the situation, the interlocking
situation of a common ownership, is a situation where, in
realistic appreciation of modera corporate realities it has to
be said that Amour does own an interest of the kind, any
interest whatsoever in the business of its sister subsidiary.
Any other approach, we think, tends fc© confuse modern corporate
realities with modem traditional notions of ownership by real
individual people of real individual things, given the power
15

1

that a holding company like Greyhound has over the various

2

corporate structures that he has chosen to put within the

3

systemp we think that realistically this has to be regarded as

4

a situation where —

20

I think that this is a conglomerate

We have not contended that this would be a See-”

fcion 7 violation and I think that in the very premise ©f this
case we don't even show that it would be one.

I think perhaps

the nature of fch® dealings between the two companies and the
magnitude of the markets might not be sufficient t© make it a
very easy SEction 7 case.

In any ©vent# we say we don't need

to cross that bridge because there is already a decs®® entered
specifically against Armour saying Armour can't, be in this kind
©£ business and that's the very purpose of this kind ©f pro'i'.

23
24
25

-

phyl&etic relief in the decree to make it unnecessary for the
Government to go into the particular facts and prove a par­
ticular violation of the anti-trust laws de novo,
Th® only question# then, as we see it, is on© of
relief, for what we think is uncante stably an interference by

16

1

Greyhound with the substantive structural relief that this

2

whole decree is designed to create or, if you will, an actual

3

situation where Greyhound has put Armour into violation of the

4

literal terms of the decree»

5

Greyhound, and not Armour, its paws, can remedy this situation

6

because the title to the stock that has to be divested to give

1

the Government the relief it wants is in Greyhound.

8

Armour, of course, in the remedial sense, is the only on® of

9

these entities that’s a party to this case.

to

Of course it's plain that only

And

As.I indicated, we have not suggested, we have not

11

proceeded on the theory that Greyhound is in active participa­

12

tion with Armour in making Armour violate the decree.

What we

13

have said is that as in the civil rights cases, which I think

14

are quit® analogous, where the courts have found the power to

15
16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

issue a supplemental order creating a remedy against inter­
ference with school desegregation, interference by a third
party, not a party to the initial decree, because of course
the party defendant in these cases has been the school boards.
The Courts have found no trouble in creating a
remedy for independent actions by third parties not in conflict
with the school board, and we think that this is a very
analogous situation.

Where Section 5 of the Sherman Act gave

the District Court power to bring Greyhound in, we think, as a
party on the theory that that was required to — the ends of
justice, and Paragraph 1® of the decree again specifically

17

1

provided that the court retain jurisdiction t© enter appropriate

2

supplemental orders to carry it out and we think that the

3

order requested in the Government* s position would have been

4

such an appropriate order*

I'd like to reserve the rest of my time.

conduct that the Government is talking about.

I think it might

be of interest to the Court — the Court probably knows that
three years after this decree was entered? back in 1925? one
of the original signatories to the decree; Morris Packing
Company? was acquired by Amour.

Here we have supposed pro­

phylactic and structural anti-trust issues that were supposedly
decided? for all purposes? in 1920 in this decree.

And yet

three years later one of the original signatory was acquired
by Armour.
Now? the fact of the matter is that this decree does
19

1

preclude some conduct and does not apply to other conduct.

2

JUi of the stock of Morris, all of 'the business of Morris, was

3

acquired by Armour.

4

of fact, the Government, over the last 50 years, has interpre­

5

ted this decree completely inconsistent with their current

S

interpretation.

There is no attack on that.

As & matter

Nhat you have, as Greyhound sees the matter, is the

7
8

same situation that this Court decided in May of 19 S9 in the

9

Hazeltine-2enith situation.

Now, to be sure, there is no

10

quarreled about in this second proceeding in 1957.

Well, I don't know whether the order could

run against the seller, Mr. Justice, but the Court can issue
an order against Armour and if the Court issues a summons
against a third party, presumably if the third party were
— under Rule S5(d) if the third party were actively partici­
pating in it it comes within Rule 65(d).

There are

other issues.
Under the Atlantic Refining case # as Justice Black
observed? “The purpose of 'the decree would be better served by
the proceeding that the Government brought.

We cannot modify

without a modification hearing the languageof the decree#
paticularly since the Government in that case and ill this #
has consistently over the years had a completely different
interpretation."
It seems to us that the problem of interpretation
of the Government in this decree over thelast 50 years is not
stopping the government in this instance# but as in the
Atlantic Refining case# as Justice Black said in that case:
For 17 years the Government had interpreted the decree con­
sistent with his interpretation in the opinion in that case.
And the new interpretation which was the new interpretation by
the Government# he suggested that perhaps modification proceed­
ings were in order.

Based on that consistent interpretation

over the 17 years# you can read into the decree its absolute
25

purpose.

1

Now, in this instance, as the Court knows, the

2
3

Government has interpreted this decree completely different

4

from a suggestion made to this Court.

5

©n March 10, 1970, while this case, that is the General Host

case, was inthis Court, the Department of Justice was filing

In the LTD litigation

papers in Pittsburgh on this very decree in the sense that
Wilson and Co., which is an original signator for the Packer8s
Decree, was a party as a subsidiary of LTV in the Pittsburgh

9

litigation.

10

Now, in that case the Government suggested to the

11

Court that LTV could own 86 or some percent of Wilson and Co.

12

and also own Jones and Laughlin; Jones and Laughlin as products

13

which are expressly included in the decree.

14

difference between those two situations?

15

Now, what is the

In both situations

you have a form of conglomerate, a holding company, LTV, or the

IS

Greyhound Corporation.

17

In both situations each of the holding

companies had a major transportation companys the Greyhound

both situations the holding company. Greyhound or

isn't a particle of difference between what the Govemmetn did
in LTV and this case and yet in LTV the Government suggested to
a Federal Court in Pittsburgh it was perfectly proper for LTV
to own a company: Jones and Laughlin, that deals in prohibited
products and also owns 86 percent of Wilson and Co.
Now, the apology for that, let's call it "different
point of view," is stated in the briefs filed in this Court
last year in the Host litigation as follows:
"A proposal of settlement" — this is the LTV
litigation — "does not make law, especially in light of the
serious anti-competitive factors involved in the underlying
case,"meaning this case.

"Moreover, the prohibition under the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY JAMES VAN R. SPRINGER, ESQ.

z

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

3

MR. SPRINGERS

4

I think, to try to put this thing back in focus

Thanky ©u Mr. Chief Justice.

perhaps I should say that this is not primarily an anti-trust

case her© at all.

9

what is bad for competition.

It is an equity case.

We are not, as we
We do not

We tsk® this decree as we find it.

10

We think there are in this decree# prohibitions against a

11

certain kind ©f structural situation.

12

everything it could fc© try to create such a prophylactic

separation.

14

that# and the only question here# as I hope I have indicated,

15

is whether thereis a remedy for such an interference or viola­

16

tion# whatever you want to call it# with a structural separation

17

which an anti-trust decree, whether it's a consent decree, or

18

a litigated decree, has tried to establish.

We think the decree did

We think anti-trust decrees should b® able to do

19

We acknowledge, of course, that this is, as far as

20

we know, a case of first impression in this Court, and perhaps

21

in any of the courts, but that’s, of course, why we brought it

22

here.

23

We say, frankly, that our case does depend upon

24

the proposition that in a decree, specifically an anti-trust

25

decree, there are two aspects; there is the substantive aspect
3$

1

and the remedial aspect.

We think a distinction can foe drawn

z

between them. This decree had a specific substantive aim

5

remedy for that, and it is for that reason that we went before

6

the Court seeking a very limited additional remedial order

7

which we had thought was necessary to remedy this breaking down,

8

of the substantive separation which the decree was designed to

9

create.

That separation has been broken

Admittedly the decree, as written, doss not provide a

Q

How about LTV?

15

A

Several things can be said about LTV.

The

16

first is that, as Mr. Foote has submitted, there is no element

17

of estoppel her®.

told Greyhound that it objected to this situation.

19

LTV came up long after the Government had

Second, and again this is a distinction from

20

Atlantic REfining: the Government has never approved LTV3s

21

simultaneous ownership of Jones and Laughlin and Wilson & Com­

22

pany . in any specific way.

23

this, and this is also true in the Prince case *— the Government

24

has nbfc taken any action against those situations.

25

The Government — the situation

The Pittsburgh cas© to which Mr. Foote refers, of

course, is a Section 7 case, initially brought t© gat LTV to

divest itself of Jones and Laughlin. So far as I know Wilson
