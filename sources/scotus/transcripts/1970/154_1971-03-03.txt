ORAL ARGUMENT BY DONALD C. ATKINSON, ESQ,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

9

MR, ATKINSON?

Mr, Chief Justice and may it

please the Courts
This matter comes to the Court on appeal from a

10

three-judge court sitting in California, United States District

11

Court, Northern District of California,

12

from a summary judgment? the summary judgment was in two parts,;

13

The first part was a declaratory' judgment, ruling that Article

14

34 of the State of California Constitution was violative of

13
16
17
18
19

20
21
22
23
24
25

The matter comes up

the 14th Amendment Equal Protection Clause,

The second part,

permanent injunction against the Defendants in the case, of
availing themselves or relying on the provisions of .Article 34
as a reason for not proceeding with the acquisition, con-,
straction or development of low-rent housing.
The Supreme Court has jurisdiction of this case
under 28 USC 1253, an appeal from a permanent injunction by a
three-judge court against an enforcement or obedience to the
provisions of the state .constitutional provision.
The cases before the Court are really two.

The

fifst is James versus Valtierra and the second is Hayes versus
2

1

the Housing Authority,

In the first case Plaintiffs Valtierra

2

and others similarly situated, on behalf of the class, people

3

who were eligible for low-rent

4

the members of the city council of the City of San Jose to

S

have Article 34 — be unconstitutional,

housing, brought action against

6

In Hayes versus the Housing Authority and also

7

in that action joined' as defendants were the members of the

8

Housing Authority of the City of San Jose,

9

the Housing Authority plaintiffs, Gussie Hayes and others

In Hayes versus

SO

similarly situated brought -die same type of action against the

IS

Housing Authority of San Mateo County,

12

In the James case an answer was filed; in the

13

Hayes case an answer was not filed.

U

solicated for purposes of argument and the decision obtains as

IS

to both cases.

16*
1?

18
19

The actions were con-

The provisions of Article XXXIV which are at
issue before the Court basically provide that no state public
body shall acquire, construct or develop low rent housing un­
less a majority ©f the people, the electors, qualified to vote

20

the locality.in which the low-rent housing is to he constructed

21

by a majority vote in favor of such low-rent housing,

22
23
24
25

Q

Mr, Atkinson, what, in your view, is the

purpose of Article XXXIV?
A

The purpose of Article XXXIV, Mr. Justice

Blackmun, was to fill a gap in the referendum procedure in

3

1

California»

2

Constitution only legislative actions were referendums.

3

opinion of the State Supreme Courts

4

the Supreme Court of Humboldt County in 1950 ruled that actions

5

of the- Housing Authority

8

procedure, were administrative rather than legislative in

7

character„ and therefore could not be reached by a referendum.

An

Housing Authority versus

aperating under the low-rent housing

Shortly thereafter,, in 1950, Proposition 10 was

8

9

Under Article IV of the State of California

placed before the voters of the State of California»

That

10

proposition is and was adopted as Article XXXIV„

11

response to your question, the immediate purpose of Article

12

XXXIV was to protect the people„ to give the people the right

13

to determine whether or not they wanted to extend low-rent

14

housing to the people in their particular area.
Q

15

16

A

Mr, Justice White, it depends on what

referendum procedure you are talking about.
Q

19
20

Well, Article XXXIV is somewhat different

from the normal referendum provision? isn't it?

17
!8

So that in

Well, you said it filled a gap in the

referendum laws —
A

21

Yes; that type of *— since that was the

22

original type of referendum that people thought they had in

23

that area in order to build that gap.
Q

24
25

However —

It did something more than that; didn't

it?

5
4

A

I

z

Well, it’s a prior

automatic referendum,

if that's what you’re referring to.
Q

3

Well, every legislative action in

4

California is not subject to referendum, I wouldn’t think? is

5

it?

I mean not automatic referendum.

6

A

7

Q

— where the legislature arid city council

A

No; this would*-- basically most lagis-

8

is ~

9
10

No; every —

lati' e acts are subject to referendum by petition.

Q

That’s right.

13

A

No; it does not.

14

Q

This is automatic.

h

That's correct.

Q

Now, if the general referendum provision

11
12

way; does it?

15
16

17
18

had been applicable, I don't suppose XXXIV would have been
passed; is that the point?

19

20
21

24
25

A

I wouldn't think so.

Q

Well, what was the purpose then of malting

it automatic instead of subject to petition?
A

22
23

This one doesn’t work that

Of course I can't really answer that

question because I had nothing whatsoever with passage of the
Article.

I can only surmise that the people felt that this was

a legitimate approach to protect their rights in a referendum

5

1

areaff and I was attempting to point out there are other types

2

of referenda in California which are subsequent — pardon me —

3

are prior automatic referenda»

4

measure; there are some sur-fcype annexation and consolidation

5

procedures? the City Charter of San Jose, with which 1 am quite

6

acquainted, has a provision for a prior automatic referendum

7

in the area of the sum and parts»

8
9

There are some initiative

And there are other types of prior automatic
referenda»

But, I don't feel that merely because we have a

10

prior automatic referendum that that of itself lends any odious

n

color to the procedure.

12

in an area where they have the right to reserve something, as

13

long as they treat the area that they restore uniformly and

14

Without treating any other similar area in a different manner,

IS

1 feel there is no unconstitutional treatment.

The people, as long as they are dealing

16

The classification here in Article XXXIV is

17

precisely limited to one small area of low-rent housing.

18

deals with that area' because, as I pointed out before, that

19

was the area that the Supreme Court of California ruled was not

20

referendable.

21

strike out and to pick out that precise area as the subject of

22

their referendum procedure.

23

It

So th51t.it certainly made sense for the people fcc

The Proposition 10 itself, when it was passed,

24

the articles pro and con, are absolutely neutral.

25

directed to the right of the people to reserve their voice in
6

They are all

f

an area where they have a concern.

Z

race; 'there is no allusion to poverty per se.

3

There is no allusion to

Q

Has this issue over gone through your state

5

A

No, Mr. Justice Harlan, it has not.

6

The - it’s ©ur contention that, the article is,

4

court system?

7

as 1 pointed out before, fills a gap that it's not an uncon-’

8

stitutional classification.

9

face; it5s not unconstitutional as applied.

It3s not unconstitutional on its
It's not a

10

classification based on race nor color in that it does not

11

violate the supremacy clause.
In the first place the article merely deals with

12

13

low-rent housing and nothing else.

It treats everyone in the

14

area of low-rent, housing the same.

And as such, it meets the

15

tests that if a new formula laid down with reference to the

16

test that the court applies in determining whether or not state

17

legislative action is violative of the Equal Protection Clause.

18

The case of Hunter versus Erickson was cited as a

19

precedent in the lower court and I submit that Hunter versus

20

Erickson on its facts, is not this case at all.

21

versus Erickson we were dealing with a situation where the

22

people of Akron had a referendum procedure right across the

23

board.

24

procedure set up to — people had been hired, categories had

25

been established and it was actually under operation.

In Hunter

They also had a fair housing ordinance which had a

7

The enactment of the referenda procedure in the

1

2

Hunter case, in effect, rescinded or repealed the existing

3

low-rent housing ordinances, fair housing ordinance and built a

4

prior referendum procedure on top of a regular referendum pro­

5

cedure,

6

there was no referenda procedure available and that- therefore

7

a new referenda procedure was necessary.

i

8
S

So that in Hunter it could not have bean argued that

Secondly, the court in Hunter specifically men­
tions the background of the referenda procedure, the fact that

10

it repealed an existing fair housing ordinance? the fact that

tl

it was racially motivated? in fact in the opinion there are

'12

references that it is an explicitly racial classification,'

13

fact, Mr, Justice Harlan and Stewart, as I recall, in a con­

14

curring opinion, indicated that the provision has the clear

15

purpose of making it more difficult for religious and racial

16

minorities to achieve legislation that is in their interest.

17

In

So, I submit that the case before you now is not

18

the Hunter ease and the Hunter case should be distinguished,

19

and to try the Hunter ease here seems to me to be placing the

20

Court as a superlegislative body, second-guessing the people

21

in dealing in legislative areas, social concern areas, that the

22
23
24
25

Court in Dandridge versus Williams said was their right,
Q

What do you say about Reitmaa- and^Mulkey?

A

Reifercan and Mulkey was a case? again where

the State Supreme Court of California had indicated that we had

8

1

racial discriminationhere on a statewide basis.

2

entered the field; it had not only encouraged, but actually

3

almost put forward racial discrimination«

4

The state had

The Supreme Court, as I recall it in the Mulkey

5

case, took the finding of the California Supreme Court and made

6

it its own and went on from there.
Q

7

Supposing this went through the State; d©

S

you think it's possible that the Supreme Court might say the

S

same thing.about this statute?

10

A

It is certainly possible.

11

Q

But it's never been before it?

12

A

It’s never been before the California

13

Supreme Court.

14

Q

Or any California court, I take it.

15

A

It8s never been in any California court;

16

that’s correct.
The — as I indicated before,, it’s not discrimina­

17
18

tory on its face.

There is no racial classification in the

19

constitutional provision; race is not even mentioned.

20

police here indicate; Well, we knov? as a matter of fact that

21

most of the poor people are Black or Spanish-speaking, et

22

cetera.

23

this

24

vision v/hich affects a minority, it doesn’t make it into a

25

racial classification.

I submit 'that this may or may not be true.

The

However

does not, per se make a statute or a constitutional pro­

9

I

As a matter of fact* I am sure you will find -that

2

as far as numbers go there are more poor whites than poor

But that really is not relevant* I don’t feel* to the

Q

Mr» Atkinson* my recollection isn’t too

6

certain* but could have made, have said the same thing about

7

Proposition 14 in Reitraan against Mulkey?

8

A

Reifcman against —

9

Q

That on its face it didn’t seem to be

10

racially motivated?

11

A

Reifcman versus Mulkey is quite distin­

12

guishable in this regard and very like Hunter»

13

Mulkey again repeals a fair housing procedure* a nondiscrimina-

14

tory procedure which had been set up in -the State of Califor­

t.5

nia.

18

Reifcman versus

The Court does know the background and the pur­

17

pose and certainly the Court was very* miry interested in that,

18

just as it was in the Hunter case.

19

sort in the case before the Court now.

20

the arguments pro and con* as I said before? it fits right into

21

the context of the necessity of the referendum procedure.

22

There is nothing of this
There is nothing in

The only conceivable argument* it seems to me*

23

that can be raised against the constitutionality of XXXIV is

24

the fact that it’s a prior automatic referendum* as-distin­

.25

guished from a subsequent petition referendum.

10

And I submit

1

that that is mot crucial because they are both referendum

2

procedures.,

concern and 'the Court should not intrude its own judgment in

4

place of the legitimate concerns of the state people.

5

6

This is an area where the state has a legitimate

Q

What are the state interests involved

A

The state interests here are both fiscal

here?

7

8

and the fact that low-rent housing per se, may be dead.

The

9

fiscal considerations are far from -the fact that under the lew-

10

cost housing procedure 'As local public body takes the property

1!

which is a low-rent housing project off the tax rolls in return

12

for ten percent of the rents.
Now, that means that also the people are required

13
14

to provide certain municipal ©r county or what have you —

15

whatever government w® are dealing with •—■ services for the

10

project, including possibly schools, parks and improvements cf

17

that natura which they wouidnst normally have to provide if the

S3

low-rent housing project did not go in a particular area.
The other consideration is the fact that low-rent

19
20

housing is not a jblassing right across the board.

21

in the low rent housing disagree among themmlves as t© whether

22

©r not it's good ©r bad? "there ar® all kinds of argument about

23

how large the housing should be? when it should be acquired,

constructed and developed? when it should be and questions ©£

that nature.

11

The experts

The. —- in fact there has been some history her®.

I point

out the housing in St. Louis * which was an absolute

3

fiasco.

In the past most ©£ these housing projects have bean

mammoth in natur®? they have led actually, to internal segrega­

5

tion; they have led to isolation, ghetto isolation and some of

6

them, have, ©s I say, fallen flat on their face.

project is now vacant.

10

property which might be extremely valuable in terms of tax

should '.have the right to consider that aspect before they want

13

a low-cost housing project built anywhere.

Realizing that the people are only

Because, tan percent ©f the project, 100 percent
full is certainly not the same as ten percent of the
rents of the project only 40 or 50 percent full.
Q

How many of these referenda have there

been sine© the XXXIV went inf© effect?
A

There have been — I don't have the exact

20

number. Justice Harlan, but I will point this out — that

21

brings up a very interesting are© for discussion.

22

XXXIV has not been discriminatory as applied.-

23

fact, most of the elections have been voted in favor of the

about it.

The

as I recall between 1968 and '70 the percentage of referenda
that-..have been approved are actually going up? not down. But

13

wfc are not dealing in an area where discrimination is running

13

rampant.
I also want to touch upon fch® points that were

20
21

22
23
24
25

brought up in the Appellees’ brief.

They attempt to‘bring in

the full classification into-, the invidious classification?
a suspect

classification? classification for the tradition­

ally 'disfavored.

And I submit that tills is not the kind of a

classification which fits any ©f thosetesta.
13

Most ©f the cases

1

— tli© Harper case, for examplee which mentioned that wealth,

2

and race were suspect classifications.

3

really was not relevant, to relevant to that case at all.

4

only reason that it was important was because who ware poor

5

were being deprived of the right to vote.

6

vote is a fundamentally constitutionally guaranteed right.

7

unless the Court her© is willing to extend its tests of funda­

would be extremely dangerous to uphold the District Court in

I submit that this Article XXXIV is neutral in

purpose, completely undiscriminatory on its face and as applied

IS

and I submit that again it would seem to ms that if the Court

17

branches out in this area and strikes down XXXIV if would seem

18

rather difficult t© determine where the line will b© drawn.

19

a constitutional provision like this can be stricken down by

20

this Court ther© is no end to the intrusion of the judiciary

21

into the legitimate concerns ©f 'the legislative enactment ef

ORAL ARGUMENT BY ARCHIBALD COX, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF .APPELLEES

4

MR. COXs

5
S
7

Mr. Chief. Justice and may it pl@ase the

Court:
In the Appellees3 brief we have canvassed a number

8

©£ grounds on which we believe that Article XXXIV of the

9

California Constitution violates bath the 14th Amendment and

10

n

the Supremacy Clause.
In ©ur argument I intend to confine myself to the

12

essence of our argument under the Equal Protection Clause of

13

the 14th Amendment. And it, very briefly, is this? it*s that

14

Article XXXIV violates the Equal Protection Clause because it

15

builds into -the

10

ment in California an explicit discrimination against the poor.

17

very structure

of government, of local govern­

In the words of the statute: "Against persons of

'18

low income who are" ~ I should say in the Constitution*

19

Article XXXIV, who are defined as persons whose income is

20

insufficient to provide them with safe, decent and sanitary

21

housing without overcrowding."

22
23
24
25

The discrimination here, as in Hunter against
Erickson, consists of putting the poor, the disadvantaged
class, putting before them a special obstacle which they must
surmount in order to secure government action in their behalf

15

1

which faces no other group seeking government actions in its

2

behalf.

3

Em ter and Erickson held that that very kind ©f

4

discrimination is unconstitutional where it ran against racial

5

minorities; our contention is that it is equally unconstitu­

6

tional where it runs explicitly against the poor and for the

7

most part in practice„ also against racial minorities,

3
9

10

Q

What would you say about a constitutional

provision that provided that all public housing be submitted
for referendum,

n

A

Welly I think that would — Iam not quite

\z

sure, Fir, Chief Justice, what you mean by ’"public housing.”

13

If it said —

IS

Q

Put in the contexts subsidised by the

Federal Government or —
A

If it said "all subsidised housing" by the

17

Federal or State Government then I think we would have a some­

18

what different case? because here there clearly is discrimina­

19

tion between subsidised middle income and upper income housing?

20

which is subsidised by the Federal Government and low rental

21

housing by the poor.

22
23

But I'm not sure that 'there wouldn't still be an
N
argument that the poor, who would' be still the chief ones "in

24

need of housing and the chief beneficiaries of housing, were

25

fch© victims of the discrimination.

Indeed, 2 think here, and as I shall try to

another day.

Q

I realise that this is hypothetical, too.

Suppose the prohibition or the referendum requirement applied
that allmultiple housing projects over 50 units?
A

Let me change Your Honor*s hypothetical

just a little bit, because 'there is on© that occurred to me
that’s more like its and -chat is if -the soning laws required
that all housing above certain numbers of units be submitted
to referendum then we would have a very different question.
That would cover high-rise apartments 'for middle income and
the well to“do and it would certainly arguable that there was
some neutral principi©.

But, I think that case is really very

different from min®.
I plan to develop the argument which I just
sketched in four stepss the first is that Article XXXIV un­
questionably, I think, directs a special obstacle in front of
persons ©f low income in seeking to have fchoir need for govern­
ment action t© fulfill one Of their greatest necessities, in
having the government act to fulfill it as compared with any

The first would be state legis­

That step has been taken.

The next step is the passage of a resolution by

10

the county government# or the city government# as the case may

11

be# activating its housing authority? and that step has been

12

taken» in both San Mateo County and in the City of San Jose#

13

the two units involved in these eases.

14

Then the third step is a preliminary application

15

for funds to prepare the drawings and get the estimates and to

16

taka the other steps to get the housing project under way.

17

And that application must b© approved by the Board of Super­

18

visors for the county ©r by the city council for the city by

19

a resolution in the same manner as local government action is

20

normally taken.

2!

And at that time# too# by a resolution the local

22

subdivision must enter into an agreement of cooperation with

23

the Federal Housing Authority.

24

according to the normal eh arm® is at that step.

25

approving the time for the project and approving the bonds and

the various other mechanics for carrying it out and I would

emphasize that under California law at that step again the

local legislative body is required to approve the particular

project.

This is an additional stub (?) t©

The disadvantage which is expressly put on the
poor by Article XXXIV, is exactly the same I find out as the
disadvantage under which the ordinance in Hunter and Erickson
put those who were interested in fair housing legislation.
Enacted, as in San Jose there was a general provision for a
referendum ©a the petition of a stated number ©f citizens» but
the charter amendment in the Akron case called for .an automatic
referendum and the court said there that the difference was
enough t© constitute a denial of Equal Protection.
The differences her© are exactly the sam® and %?e

comes after the subdivision or the legislature has acted.

the action is effective unless vetoed by the voters.

One is a change in

political boundaries or the structure of local government*

n

Article XXXIV makes such a change but the vote taken under it

12

on housing projects isn't a vote on the change in the political

case of the issuance of bonds which are — bonds of the state»

The California Supreme Court pointed out that
