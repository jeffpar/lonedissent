ORAL* ARGUMENT BY RICHARD A, BUCKLEY, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

7

MR. BUCKLEY:

8

10

Mr. Buckley you may proceed whenever you are

ready.

S

S

We will now hear

Mr. Chief Justice and may if please

the Court:
This is the appeal of a Louisiana Supreme Court

11

decision which affirmed Appellant's conviction and sentence

12

for -the crime of armed robbery.

13

Two issues considered by the Court below and

14

before this Court for review, involve the question of jury,

15

tli© question of arrest.

16

Specifically, with regard to the jury question,

17

there are two aspects to it: does the Louisiana jury system,

is’

which provides for a nonunanimous verdict, in serious felony

19

cases, clash with the Equal Protection Clause because it denies

20

■the benefit of unanimity to Appellant by extending it to 'those)

21

charged and tried for greater and lesser crimes.

22
23

24
25

The second aspect of the jury question concerns
whether, in light of Winship, sthe majority verdict is con­
stitutionally permissible in that Appellant has not been proved
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
2

system?

Hr. Bucklsy, how old is the Louisiana

Is it an ancient one?
A

3

It began in 1898 when Louisiana revised

4

its constitution and as you know* the grandfather clause and

5

other provisions were made at that time.
The other issue that is considered relevant here

6
7

before this Court, is whether Appellant’s lineup identifica­

0

tion, which

9

unlawful arrest, was — should have been excluded from the

10

trial of this case*
The Court below, in response to the two issues

11

12

13
14

considered, deferred to this Court on the question concerning
jury?, although they did hold that system was fair and gave
fairness to Appellant in this trial»
In regards to the lineup identification the

15

19

20
21

22
23
24

25

Appellant contends was a direct result of an

Lousiana Supreme Court found a lawful arrest based upon pro­
bable cause.

The relevant facts pertaining to the issues are

as follows:
Appellant, a Black citizen, was seized in his
home before daybreak, by six armed New Orleans detectives with
shotguns, who had entered his home without a warrant»

A

general search was conducted of all the rooms; no evidence
connecting the Appellant with any crime was found therein»
Subsequent to some interrogation, Appellant was booked about
four hours after the initial entry of his home»
3

1

A £ew days later Appellant was part of a general

2

lineup consisting of arrtied robbery suspects and armed robbery

3

victims.

4

victim of armed robbery a couple weeks previous to Appellant’s

5

arrest,

6

whom Appellant was booked for armed robbery initially at his

7

arrest.

And he was identified by a person who was then a

I may mention that this was not the same person for

The identification was subsequently used at trial;

8
9

in fact, identification formed theprimary basis of the evi­

10

dence against Appellant, Pretrial motions and hearing were held

11

on the arrest and detention of Appellant and they were denied

12

by the trial court.
Appellant was tried on May 15, 1968 for armed

13
14

robbery, a crime punishable in Louisiana for not less than five

15

or more than 99 years, without the benefit of parole, proba­

16
17
18

tion or suspense of sentence.

of: nine for "guilty," and three for "not guilty,"which con­
stitutes, in Louisiana, conviction.
Appellant was sentenced subsequently, to 35 years

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

A jury of 12 returned a verdict

at hard labor and is presently serving 35 years in Angola (?)
Louisiana.
Q

Does the record show, or do you know how

long the jury deliberated?
A

X don’fc know whether the record shows; I

believe it was less than half an hour, Your Honor.

4

1

Q

Hew long did the trial last?

2

A

The trial was one day.

Most of the facts;

o

of course, were taken up at thepretrial hearings, which lasted

4

over a span of four days.

tJ

5

Q

Let me get that last: four days altogether?

6

A

Louisiana conducts separate pretrial in

7

the trial itself: the pretrial hearings concerning the arrest,

0

detention, et cetera, took place earlier and over a span of

9

three days they were held, without a jury.

10

In regard to the issue of whether a nonunanimous

n

verdict is denial of equal protection, I will briefly mention

12

the Louisiana jury system.

13

cases there would be a jury consisting of 12, of which all

14

must concur.

15

the jury consists of 12, of which only nine have to concur in

16

the verdict.

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Lousiana provides that in capital

In crimes that must be punishable by hard labor,

In crimes which may be punishable by hard labor,

the jury consists of five jurors of which all must concur in
the verdict.
Louisiana asserts the reason, and this has also
been explained in the decisions of Louisiana, but in their
brief they indicate the reason for this difference in the
classification between the different crimes and the way they
are tried, is to reduce costs and expedite matters.

We con­

tend that this is not a rational basis, for Louisiana to ex­
tend unanimity to some and deny it to Appellant.
5

Well, your equal- protection argument, I

Q

1
2

suppose, is based on the difference between the Louisiana

3

requirement in capital cases and its requirement respecting

4

noncapital cases which are subject to punishment at hard

5

labor.

Is that your equal protection — ?

A

6

7

you an example of that.

A

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

It works down the line concerning the
V

benefit of unanimity and the function it plays in the jury
trial, Your Honor.

To give an example of how it works up the

line, is that, as you know, in most jurisdictions Louisiana
won, in the capital case the jury can return a recommendation
that punishment be without the death penalty.
In Louisiana individuals that the jury does return

17
18

But your equal protection thing doesn't

work down the line, does it; on that basis you got better pro­

11
12

Yes, and if I may, Your Honor, I will give

that recommendation to are eligible for parole and pardon with­
in 12 years.

And, as I indicated eearlier, an individual now

convicted of armed robbery, as Appellant was, does not have the
benefit of parole or provision

or suspense of his sentence;

he must serve the entire time and the verdict could be until
99 years.

This, by the way, was amended in 1966.
Q

Mr. Buckley, as a lawyer engaged in the

defense of criminal cases, do you think it's harder to get

6

1

unanimity among the five or nine out of 12?
A

2

I believe it9s harder to get unanimity out.

3

of five, and that, may be one of the reasons that the District

4

Attorneys Association of Louisiana, has attempted twice during

5

the 1960s to have that changed from five to four out of five*

6

unsuccessfully.
Q

7

Well, five out of five is obviously more

8

difficult than four out of five, but I wondered if five out of

©

five was harder to obtain than nine out of 12?
A

of five forces the jury to the deliberative process and in the
exchange of the doubts that each may have, maybe then one can
convince another and the two groups, the two coalitions that
might have gone in there with different views, are able then
to persuade one group to the other.

22

jurors went immediately from the jury box into the deliberatiori
and made a vote, without any deliberating process coming into
function.
Q

In any event, whether it be five or 12,

the fact remains that a single person can result in a hung
jury, if you require unanimity.

23
24

25

Whereas, any nine out of

12 it9s possible, as in this case it may have happened that the

Q

Well, you want unanimity with 12 at all

No; I don't think that 12 is the require­

times ?

A

ment.,

It's not the numbers that are important, as was so well -

expressed in Williams»

I think it's unanimity in its func^t

tion as close, direct association to the essential jury func­
tion, that is the key to the problem»
Q

Well, suppose they say that nine out of
8

1

12 for murder; then you would be out of court; wouldn't you?

2

A

No, we wouldn't, Your Honor»

3

Q

Why not?

Then we would still have the argument that

5

this does not reach the constitutional requirement of guilt

beyond a reasonable doubt»

Correct»

I would.

There is some slippery slope,

as it was mentioned in Williams, that is going to be reached
very soon in regard to juries and unanimities»
a very difficult jury to cope with»

have a split from the beginning and it may result in many hung

I believe that this Court would be able to

draw it better than I»

as now exists in Louisiana»

Well, now, when you responded to Justice

of policy, or a constitutional requirement?

There is a point that reaches absurdity.

attacking the five-man in this case?

Your Honor»

12
13

Of course you recognize that some defense

argument.

Only in regard to the equal protection

We're not attacking the number of —
Q

All right.

A

Another aspect in regard to the equal

protection argument is that Kalven stated the American jury
has given some evidence that in crimes with trials where the
verdict has to be unanimous, there are hung juries about five
percent of the times whereas, a nonunanimous jury verdict type
case, a hung jury result about half of the time.
Taking that statistic and comparing it to what
happens to the hung juries in the unanimous situation and those
which in Louisiana, permits convictions, would indicate, as is

25

10

1

expressed in our brief that there would be a result of about

2

44 percent convictions in Louisiana and about 12 percent

3

acquittals, if you used the statistics that Kalven has.

4

of course, does represent that there is a cgrefcer chance of

5

conviction than acquittal in Louisiana's schema of providing

6

the rule of nine out of 12.

7

Q

This,

Is that the standard, a constitutional

8

standard, Mr. Buckley, which is likely or less likely to pro­

©

duce a verdict of guilty of not guilty?
A

10

No; it's not a constitutional standard now

11

but it goes to show the value of the mistrial and the hung

12

jury and that when the jury initially

13
'14
13

16

if there are fehse® or more jurors that have a doubt, this
rep esents a aubstanfci&l doubt and I,think that the statistics
in the American jury go to buttress that and for Louisiana to
convict on that basis is a denial of the constitutional —
Q

17
10

19

22
23
24
23

Would you have the same objections if the

nine to three verdict was permitted in Louisiana after three
hours of deliberation or two or four hours?
A

20
21

begins "the deliberationi:'

Yes; I would, Your Honor, personally.

I

don't think that, because of some of the types of crimes that
can be tried under the nine out of 12.
Communist

For example; the

storage of Communist propaganda is a serious

felony in Louisiana and can be fried by the rule of nine.

But,

I don't think any time limit should be attached to deliberations.
11

1

I think a very vital function of the jury is to be formed by

z

the deliberative process* and should not be restricted in any­

3

way o
Q

4

Well* the hypothetical situation I put to

5

you* that applies in some states, doesn't restrict it.

6

restricts the jury merely in returning a less than unanimous

7

verdict until they have run the course of some minimum period

3

of deliberation.
In many states, as you know, in civil cases,

9
10
11

12

13

particularly, after X hours of deliberation they may return a.
verdict of 5/6 in a civil case.

16

we're dealing with here?
A

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

I think it's more objectionable in a

criminal case to permit that cictivity you described. Your
Honor.
Q

17
18

Now, do you think that's as

constitutionally objectionable in criminal cases as the one

14

15

It

Well, I thought you were complaining that

the brevity of their deliberations and that the nine to three
provision of Louisiana permitted a verdict to comeback in a
short time —
A

Well, that is also another aspect ©f it,

and I have indicated in regard to this particularjury verdict,
isethat there might not have bean any deliberation and that is
permissible under the jury scheme of Louisiana.
One further aspect of the equal protection
12

1

argument: I would like to make is that the divided jury ver­

2

dicts result in a denial of essential jury functions, which

3

we feel are closely associated to the unanimity rule»

4

example: a significant segment of the community in Louisiana,

5

25 percent, is not part of that conviction verdict»

6

instead of shared responsibility in the jury9s guilt determina­

7

tion process, we have a split or divided responsibility.

Thus,

There is a possibility that a'minority, not given

Government oppression»

It’s well known in the past Govern-,

menfc oppression works on the basis of a majority rule.
And the minority, the three jurors in Louisiana,
may be citizens who were involved in the _______

_

eases in

1960; Garner versus Louisiana, Keller versus Louisiana, and
Lumpel(?) versus Louisiana.
And finally, after obtaining and becoming part, of
that fair cross-section of the community, be it Farr (?) and
Louisiana and other cases that this Court has decided, and in
which die Fifth Circuit has been confronted with again in -the
1960s, the minority of three jurors, excluded again, may be
from that section of the community which has just recently
been included on the juries.
Q

Do you think the Federal practice of
13

1

requiring unanimous verdicts of a jury in criminal cases is

2

cons titutionaXly-required?

3

A

Yes* Your Honor.

In Federal trials?

Yes* Your Honor.

What particular provision in the Constitu­

Process Clause of the Fifth. Amendment.

Without the requirement of unanimity it

is going to cut into the fairness of the trial and therefore
not be the trial and its purposes and functions as expressed
by this Court in Duncan«
Q

17

I would rest on both the aspect of the

Now* as expressed by this Court in re

Winship* gave a reasonable doubt standard constitutional
status* in essence the reasonable doubt standard or formula*
is merely a guide to both prosecution and to the jury.

As to

the prosecution* it indicates to him the degree* proof or
degree of persuasion that lie must present in order to secure
a conviction.
To the jury7 it is a guide to indicate to them
degree of belief of the individual's guilt in order for them
14

1

to return, and agree upon a conviction.
As to the prosecution's function# his is to the

body consisted of a jury of 12 individuals and to exclude any

5

part of that fact-finding body# to be unreasonable.

6

this case there were three jurors that ware unpersuaded and

7

unconvinced by the evidence presented by the prosecutor.

And in

And furthermore, as to the jury, the reasonable

23
24
25

That is the value of the jury's deliberation

So that during deliberation views could be expressed

doubt can be examined? and the jury could finally come to un­
animity on the particular question before them.
Deliberation certainly helps to clarify some of
the jurors9 doubts and in this case there may not have been
any deliberation at all —
Q

Suppose they had deliberated four days and

came in 9 to 3?
A

I would say# Mr. Justice Marshall# that

that jury had a vary substantial doubt and that is the reason
why they cannot com© to an agreement.
Q

Suppose it would come in 11 to 1?

A

To that long a period of time I would also

have to say that.
15

Q

1

Well, my whole point is: I just want to

2

know how much stress you are putting on the length of time

3

of deliberation; that's all I'm trying to clear in my mind»

4

You seem to say that the only purpose you want a five-man

5

[jury is so that they will deliberate and obviously, from your

6

answers that's not what you mean to say»
A

7

No, Your Honor, it's not the only purpose»

8

I am trying t© show that it's one of the essential, functions

9

of the unanimity rule which is directly associated with the

10

reasonable doubt standard, is so that there will be delibera­

your needs are, and since Mr. Buckley has run out of time, if
we do enlarge here, we will enlarge his a little bit.
MRS. KORNS;

Certainly, Your Honor.

T© begin with, on the jury question, the first
question in the case, just to touch briefly on the historical
background of a majority jury verdict system; as this Court
know, various theories have been advanced to explain why a
unanimous jury verdict became required in many jurisdictions,
particularly in England up until 1967, between the 13th Cen­
tury and about 1967.

And Lower Justice Devlin, I think
22
1

1

mosfc writers concede that Lord Justice Devlin's theory that

2

it was purely by chance is a correct theory.
As Lord Justice Devlin

3

and I think Professor

4

Thayer also, in the Harvard Law Review, point outs during the

5

middle ages in England in trial by compurgation, there was

6

the custom of a party having to have his version of the facts

1

supported by the oaths of 12 jurors.

3

12 compurgators, but if these 12 compurgators wouldn't support

9

file oath of the party they would keep adding to them and

to

24
25

So they would assemble

adding to them until finally out of who knows how many numbers
100

'bh&f.dhad 12 men sworn to the position of one party and

then he won the case.
To just skip briefly over it: as 'the function
of the jury around in the 12th Century gradually changed to
judging credibility, rather than swearing to it, the practice
of adding extra jurors was eliminated, but the requirement that
the Crown obtain 12 votes to convict was kept.

And therefore,

as Mr. Justice Devlin points out, the unanimity requirement
grew out of a majority system of jury verdicts in which at
least 12 votes were needed to support, a verdict, out of an
untold number.
Now, at the present time, as this Court knows,
majority verdicts, exist, not only in six states in this
country, as well as Puerto Rico, but in countries which formerl 7
formed a part of the British Commonwealth.
23

Notably, it has

1

existed in Scotland? the 8''to 7 verdict from time immemorial?

2

and works very well»

3

1967? in the Criminal Justice Act of that year* adopted

4

majority votes in criminal trials? specifically the law re™

5

And in England? as this Court knows? in

quires that where a jury consists of not more than 11? ten can

6

bring in a verdict? where a jury consists of not more than 10?

7

9 can bring in a verdict provided that a verdict of guilty

8

cannot be brought in by a majority vote unless the jury has

9

deliberated at least two hours»
X think this Court is familiar with the fact that

10
11

in England jurors drop cut in the trial — but -chat’s

12

immaterial and X won’t go into that point»
As this Court also knows? because it pointed cut

13
14

in Williams versus Florida?

15

Colonial times in a number of states? notably: Pennsylvania?

argument that every feature of the common law jury as it
.r

existed at the time our constitution was drawn up? was Incorporated in our constitution every time the word "jury" is
mentioned»

This Court rejected that and point out that as

by Mr. James Madison in the House? to the

House? and as originally adopted by the House?the jury amend­
ment required that? among other things? a vote must be
24

e

That the person has this right was rejected in

An impartial jury.

It doesn't

Now, to get right down to the issue in this case,

7

as I see it, as was posed by this Court in a footnote in

8

Williams in which it said it took no stand on whether a

§

majority verdict violated due process.

Arid, as Louisiana sees

10

it, the issue is very simples whether the use by a state of a

11

majority vote in a criminal trial violates the due process

12

clause of the 14th Amendment because it infringed the principio

13

that a person accused of a crime cannot be convicted except

14

upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of all the facts necessary

15

to prosecute the crime.
That is the issue for decision, as far as

18
17

Louisiana sees it.

As Louisiana sees it the equal protection

18

argument is really subordinate and not important, because, if

19

in fact, a majority verdict satisfies due process, as we think

20

it does, the equal protection question really goes out of the

21

picture because as soon as everyone similarly situated is

22

treated the way the appellant here was; that is; anybody in

23

Louisiana accused of a crime for which the punishment is

24

necessarily hard labor, is treated the same way.

25

it, the crucial question is whether a majority verdict

25
ii

As we see

1

satisfies or violates *3us process in the 14th 2toendment and

2

that# to us# is the crux.

3

others# based on some irrational classification; wouldn't it?
Even though neither one would viol cite due process.
A

Well, actually# the truth is# Mr. Justice

Stewart, that — as I studied this case and evaluated it# 1
arrived at that conclusion I just expressed because# as I will
show later in the argument; there is no difference in -the per­
centage of convictions between cases tried by a majority vote
and cases tried by a unanimous vote.

And that would be the

crux of any unequal protection argument, as I see it.
And what can an accused argue on his equal protec­
tion argument, unless he can say; Look, I have a 10# or 15 or
20 percent greater chance of being convicted by a majority vote
than another person in my state has who is accused of another
type of crime.

As I see it# that's the only type of unequal

protection argument you can make.

Q

Mrs. Korns, to pursue

Stewart's question —
A

Yes, Your Honor.

25
26

Mr. Justice

Q

1

To pursue Mr. Justice Stewart’s question;

2

if a state provided that all automobiles up to 2,000 pounds

3

would have a license of $10 and all those over 2,000 would

4

be $20, would there be any equal protection problem in that?
A

5

Well, right there the.re would be a mone­

6

tary loss to the person who had to buy the license, if nothing

7

else, but our position in this case is that there is no loss

8

to the accused by being tried by a majority rather than a

9

unanimous verdict.
So, excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice, but I don’t

license and another person had to pay $20? right
difference of $10.
Q

there is a

Somebody is being hurt $10.

Well, but if it's based upon the weight of

the automobile or the price of the automobile, is that an in
vi.dious discrimination?

Well, there again, in the alternative I

would say it wasn’t right; in the alternative I would say it
was —- at the beginning we say that Louisiana — every — all
the study I have been doing on this case since I first started
working on this brief, convinces me more and more that there is
absolutely no higher rate of conviction in jurisdictions — in

23
cases tried by a majority vote than in unanimous verdict cases,
24

trouble with having a xiine out of 12 jury involving — when a

S©e, in

England,

when they — I studied lots of

English materials in writing this brief.

Mr. Roy Jenkins, who

was Home Secretary, and who pushed the majority verd&ttt
through parliament because he was so convinced it would help
the administration of justice in England -— he states and his
arguments are summarized in these various British journals
that I cite in my brief

he states in the House of-Commons,

or someone stated for him -— that he was sure that the innocent
would not suffer for this and he pointed to the time-honored
practice in Scotland of bringing in criminal verdicts by 8 to
7; a 15-man jury, eight can convict.

29

And he pointed otit that certainly in Scotland

1

2

nobody had ever complained that the innocent suffered*, or that

3

there was any discrimination against the accused because he

4

was convicted by eight out of ,15 men»
Q

5

Mrs o Korns , as

far as you know, has the

6

Louisiana system ever been Federally attacked before this

7

case?

8

A

Only in Duncan it was attacked on the

9

basis that we allowed trials before judges when the punishment

10

could be up to two years, and we lost that case and this Court

11

said we had to have juries for anything — for any serious

12

crime, which in Baldwin this Court narrowed down to six months

13

But, actually, after we lost Duncan we then

14

amended our laws to have everybody — either to bring down the

15

punishment to six months, dr to allow a jury trial in anything

16
17

18

over six months.
As a matter of fact, Mr. Justice Blackmun, the
first part of our constitutional provision here, which is set

19

out on pages 3 to 4 of Louisiana's brief, is that all trials

20

in misdemeanor cases shall be by judges, but then we had

21

22
23
24
25

sentences up to two years," therefore, this Court's decision in
Duncan cut across that first provision of our constitution
which goes on and says — you see, it's very logical the way
the legislature set it up in 1898.

They said all misdemeanors

shall be by judge alone? all crimes which may be punished by
30

1

hard labor will be by a five-man jury, all of whom must

2

concur»

3

Which is the instant one, shall bs by a 12-man jury, nine of

4

whom

All crimes which shall be punished by hard labor,

must concur»
All capital crimes shall be by a 12-man jury,

S

6

all of whom shall concur,

more than six months can be imposed,

No, Your Honor; we have never had it.

This is res novo; this is it right here,

and that's why I say,

this is very important for Louisiana, this case, and this
point.

whether more would be convicted or less would be convicted.

Well, I don't think it does, Your Honor,

in the alternative as my second point.

But, you see the whole

picture of Appellant's case has been here, and that's why I
researched this so- carefully.

Their whole pitch, has been:

Look, we have been denied due process of law because we had a
much greater chance of'being convicted than somebody tried by

24
a unanimous jury or a five-man, jury and so, seeing as that was

A

NO ~

Q

I mean the Federal Government„

A

Noj actually the only way we can say --

the only logical argument a person can make about needing a
unanimous verdict requirement in criminal trials, is to —
only two arguments they can make, as I see it«

One: is the

argument which this Court rejected in Williams versus Florida»
That is, but which the Court had sort of sanctioned in earlier
cases, but which it repudiated in Williams versus Florida, and
that is that the jury, as it existed at common law in England
at the time our constitution was drafted, was the jury that the
drafters of the constitution had in mind.
Now, this Court rejected that argument in
Williams, when they rejected the 12-man jury, because at the
time the Englishmen founded Federal American colonies they had

25
33

1

a 12“man unanimous jury,,

That was rejected in Williams.

Kowt the only other argument you car? make is:

2
3

Look, I stand an unfair chance of being convicted, under this

4

type of jury system.

5

ted; I'm not going to —- see, they argument that the reasonable

6

doubt standard is violated.

7

Winship that the fact that an accused had to be convinced, by

8

proof' beyond a reasonable doubt was because of the due process

9

clause»

10

Somehow or other I'm going to be convic­

And 'this Court held, in re

So, that’s the crux of their argument.

If a 9/3

11

verdict comes in it means three men doubted and the burden of

12

proof hasn’t been carried.

13
14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23

Well, the flaw in that argument is

this: this jury came in in 20 minutes, to answer the question
of Mr. Justice Stewart, I think; and 20 minutes.

They must

have gone out, elected their foreman and it was the first or
second ballot.

They came in in 20 minutes.

Statistics show, and, as Kalven and Seisel’s
Study of the American Jury, with which this Court is familiar,
I know, because -this Court cited it in the Williams versus
Florida — studies show that any jury and the American Jury,
this book, includes majority verdicts, so it includes 'the
Louisiana jury.

When a jury deliberates long enough it will

reach unanimity in 95 percent of the cases.

They say that

over and over again.
24
25

Therefore, in the present case there is no —

34

1

2
3
4

there was a 95 parcent chance if this jury had not come back
into the courtroom at the end of 20 minutes with a 9 to 3
verdict of guilty, there is a 95 percent chance that if it had
sat there long enough it would have reached unanimity.
There is no chance in Louisiana's view, that it

5

enough — well, in the first place it said: a jury which
satisfied the requirements, which is the primary requirement
of jury trials, that a body of laymen be interposed between

The body, and the five men, 'they said, and this

Justice Black -- does,

I say it doesn't,and the proof is that they had to enact a

statute to make it that way.

In other words, if the constitution was clear,

The most the accused can hope

for is a hung jury.
Q

From that jury; from that jury, and then

he gets a new trial and he gets a bigger jury.
A

Right.

If he gets a new trial, Mr. Justice

Stewart, there are no figures to determine what the rate of
convictions are under the new trial.

Some people think they

are higher and some people think they are lower, but there at
least we can assume there will be a certain number of convic­
tions on a new trial.
So, what does he get, but a faint hope that on a
new trial he might get an acquittal"
