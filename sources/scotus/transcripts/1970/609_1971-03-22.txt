ORAL ARGUMENT BY MICHAEL S. FLAM,

7

ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF ARIZONA
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

0

MR. FLAM:

9

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:

to

This case involves the validity of Arizona®s

n
iZ

legislative policywhich requiras a person to be a United

13

States citizen, or in lieu of the United States citizenship, a

14

resident of the United States for 15 years as a condition for

15

paying welfare benefits in the State of Arizona.

.

There are seven other states that have similar

!6
17

provisions.
Briefly the facts: the named Appellees Carmen

18

19

Richardson, is an alien lawfully admitted to this country under

20

our laws.

21

22
23
24
25

She has been a continuous resident ©f the State of

Arizona for 13 years.

Mrs. Richardson, prior to th® filing of

the complaint was eligible for assistance under the Aid to the
Permanently and Totally Disabled Program, but for th® United
Status citizenship requirement or in lieu of U. S» citizenship
for 15 years durational, national residency requirement.

2

f

Appellee filed a class action lawsuit in the

2

United States District Court for the District of Arizona,

3

attacking the constitutionality of the citizenship require­

4

ments.

5

ments violated her right to travel and denied her equal

6

tection under the law as guaranteed by the- United States

7

Constitution»

The claimed infirmity was that the citizenship require­

Sh© also alleged two statutory grounds? on© that

8
9
10

pro­

the statute violated the Social Security Act and twos that the
statute violated 42 U.S. Code 2000(d).
The District Court, after hearing, enjoined the

11
12

Appellant from enforcing the United States citizenship re­

13

quirement as provided by Arizona law and thereafter, upon

14

motion of the Appellant, stayed the judgment from a judicial

15

review by this Court.
We would first like to point out that -there has

16

\

17

bean no invidious discrimination in this case .as was found in

18

the case of Shapiro v. Thompson.

19

■this case is to creat® two classes for detentlining who shall

20

be eligible for welfare benefits in the State of Arizona; ©no

21

class of citizens; 'the other are aliens.

All the state has don© in

v

22

This Court, .by prior decisions, has allowed

23

states to favor citizens over aliens in the war on poverty.

24

Specifically we direct the Court’s attention to the case of

25

People v„ Crane where Justice Cardozo stated? "To disqualify
3

I

aliens is discrimination indeed, but not arbitrary discrimina­

2

tion .95

3

Q

That wasn't a decision, of this Court,

4

A

The decision of the lower court which was

5

affirmed by the United States Court — opinion.

6

opinion in the lower court is very instructive,

But, his

C3Tc disqualify aliens is discrimination, indeed,

7

3

but not arbitrary discrimination? for the principle of ex­

9

clusion is restriction of the resources of the state to the

1©

advancement or profit of members of the state.

11

unwise such a discrimination may be is not for that reason

12

unlawful,"
Farther, last -tern this Court decided the case

13
14

Ungenerous and

©f Dandridga v. Williams, which we feel is very instructive.

15

In that case the Court stated? in the area of occj-tordLes and

IS

social welfare the state did not-violate equal protection

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

i ■

merely because of the classification made or its laws were
imperfect.
But if the classification lias some reasonable
basis it does not offend the United States Constitution.
Q

What is the reasonable basis for this one?

A

Yes, Mr. Justice Marshall.

We submit that

the state doeshave a reasonable basis for favoring U. S.
citizens over aliens.

Funds available for welfare purposes in

the State of Arizona are quite limited.

4

For example: a family

1

of four in the State of Arizona drawing ADC? the maximum

2

payment is $167 a month.

3

one Appellee applied for —

4

Q

Do you have enough money for your hospitals ?

3

A

Mor we don't, sir.

8

Q

Well, can you exclude aliens from hospitals'^

1

Could you?

8

A

Well, let's put it this way ~

9

Q

If you had anything other than lack of

A

As a reasonable basis?

10

For the

adult program such as the

money.

11

I think what I

12

would like to say to the Courts that these sums are barely

13

enough to sustain the life of the parsons presently partici­

14

pating in the program.

15

Q

10

A

Now, if you further dilute the funds

18

Q

The only reason is lack of money?

19

A

17

20

2!
22
23
24
25

The only reason —

available —

That is correct.

Q

And yon consider that a reasonable ground?

A

Yesf sir? I think that's a reasonable

basis in light of the decision in Dandridge v. Williams.
Q

Is there any — what's the history of this

legislation in Arizona? do you know?
A

Yes, sir? it was enacted approximately in
5

1

1937.

2

Q

3

A

• 37?
Yes , at the time the states provided for

4

welfare assistance and received funds; from the Federal Govern­

5

ment.

6

I believe in 1956 it was lowered to the present 15-year

7

limitation.

At one time the residency requirement was 25 years.

Q

3

9

io

You don't have anything in your

stato

legislature equivalent to the Congressional Record so that we
could *—

n

A

Ho, sir? there is ao legislative history

12

or as such; that's correct.

13

Q

Nothing to show the —what

the

state

14

legislature had in mind in enacting that.

You have told my

15

brother Marshall that the rationalisation or the purpose of thu

16

state is to save money.

17

A

And conserve funds? right.

13

Q

Conserve the necessarily finite funds.

But

19

1 was wondering if that9s what the legislative history shows

20

and

2'i

22
23
24
25

the answer —

A

It appears that, you know, from reading

the statute that that's the purpose.

In Arizona funds are

appropriated on an annual basis for welfare and they cannot
be increased except by an act of the legislature. So the
Appellants, in administering the welfare programs, must
6

1

divida the funds available amongst a myriad of potential

2

recipients.
Now, by adding, aliens to the welfare rolls would

3
4

dilute the funds available to the parsons presently partici­

5

pating.

6

low and to add two to 3,000 aliens who may become eligible

7

for welfare assistance in Arizona, would damage -the program

S

tremendously„

And as I pointed out to the Court, the sums are quite

Q

9

Is there any showing as to hot'? many poten­

10

tial alien receipients there are?

11

two or 3,009.
A

12

It used to be more than

Yesi when the Appellant moved for a stay

13

of tha judgment in the lower court the Department of Public

14

Welfare submitted an affidavit by the Director of Assistance

15

Payments and 1 would like to refer the Court to page 53 of 'the

'IS

Appendix.
In -the affidavit we estimate that there are

17
18

between 2,600 and 3,900 residant aliens eligible for welfare

19

assistance in the State of Arizona.

20

of course, some of those people have met the 15-year residency

2?

requirement

.22

23
24
25

I would like to point out

so that's why we have the 2>6G9 figure and the

high figure ©£ 3,900, for that variation.
G

Most of these in Arizona, I suppose would

be from Mexico?
A

We concede that most of the resident aliens
7

!

living in the State of Arizona are from Mexico? however the

2

statute applies to all aliens equal!;/ —
Q

3

I understand; I understand.

I was just

asking as a matter of —

4
5

A

That is correct.

0

Q

Th® 15 years doesn91 have to be necessarily

A

That is correct; it's a national residency

in Arisons?

7
8

requirement.

9

And this is distinguishable from the residency

to

requirement that was stricken by this Court in Shapiro v.

II

Thompson.
Recent decisions cf this Court uphold the

12

13

state interest doctrine wherein states may favor citizens over

U

aliens.

'5

mission, which is much discussed in the briefs, uphold that

The IS 48 case of Takahaski versus Fish and Game Com-

provision.

!\>

However, in that case this Court could not find

17

that -the State of California had a special state interest in

18

conserving the fish off its coast.
I think that one tiling that's very important

19

tha •; this Court must take notice of s that the states are

A

2

,

• Why not cut off all the wolfare?
Well, that's a prerogative of the state

3

legislature and we do have a problem pertaining to welfare,

4

not only in the State of Arizona, but in every State of the

5

Union.

6

7

Q

Da you see more of a problem of cutting

off of all welfare than cutting off of those 2,000?

8

A

Well, the State

Those 2,000 don’t©at?

10

A

Pardon?

Vi

Q

12

13
14
15

17
18

The distinction is that 2,000 don’t eat?

is that what you think?
A

They eat, sir, but past decisions of this

Court, have uphold 'the right of the State of Arizona and other
states — I should say Arizona, but our doctrines who favor
citizens over aliens.

But whet we’re trying to do is save

part ©f our sinking ship.
I think everybody is in agreement that the welfare

19

programs in the United States in ©vary State of ’the Union, are

\ 1

in serious trouble and they do not do the job.

Ev

25

Q

And how many statas do you happen to know

of have this exclusion of alien provision» either in the pure
form, as in the next case, or as you have got it here?

A

Approximately seven or eight states, sir.

Q

Seven or eight?
9

A

Yes.

.

Q

Wliera are they located?

3

A

Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania —

There is another one out there ~

They are spread out.

It's not specifically

the Southwest ©r thosestates that border Canada.

7

Q

Do you tax aliens and ■**-*

S

A

Yes, sir we do.

9

They pay sales taxes,

income taxes just like citizens.
Q

10

And if an alien lives there for ten years

11

on a job and he pays taxes and if ha loses his job and needs

12

relief ha can31 gat it?
A

13

That is correct,

But it is not encumbent

14

upon the Stats? of Arizona, once a person comes from a foreign

15

country to live within a state, to maintain his existence.

16

I don’t think you could find that under the constitution or

17

any statutory scheme of Congress or the Stats of 'Arizona.
Q

WE11, that's — that's true for citizens.

20

A

That's true for citizens.

21

0

The question of Equal Protection -~

22

A

That is correct.

18
19

23

24
25

too,

We submit, based on the

special state interest doctrine which has been announced by
this Court in previous decisions that the State? of Arizona
has the right to favor citizens over its aliens in welfare

10

1

2

prog rants»
I cannot overemphasize the importance we rely

3

upon in the case of Dandridgs v. Williams,, when this Court has

4

stated that the constitution does not ©slower this Court to

S

second-guess state officials charged with the difficult

6

responsibility of allocating limited public welfare funds

7

amongsta myriad of potential recipients.

8
9

Appellees rely heavily upon the right of travel?
however,.': they do not show or demonstrate to this Court that

10

that right extends to aliens.

In Shapiro v. Thompson that

II

right was idle reason, the primary reason why citizens who had

12

to wait one year were deprived of equal protection of the law.

13

Assuming arguendo that the right to travel does

14

extend to aliens the statutes in question, we submit, do not

15

have a chilling affect upon the exercise of that right.

16

For one things indigency alone severely limits

17

one's/.mobility.

18

we'-re dealing with a national residency requirement.

19

20
21

Another fact not to be overlooked is that

not require an alien to reside- - in idle State of Arizona.

:'ior, does our law impede free movement or job
opportunities.

23

shown by a logical extension of their argument.

23

The

requirement is that they reside in Idle United States.

The flaw of the'Appellees * position can be

to move to another state? for examples my state, Arizona, whore

as tenable then all distinctions affecting aliens and citizens

Clearly this has not been the wisdom of the

policy is

is bolstered by a committee report of the Congress which

states; "A stata may if it wishes, assist, only those who are

14

citizens, but not. insist on their having been bora citizens

15

or on their having been naturalized citizens for a specified

period of time.”

17

This interpretation

Further, this has been the view of the Secretary

18

of Health, Education, and Welfare, the person charged with the

m

administration of the Social Security Act.

20

The Arizona citizenship requirements, I should

21

point out to the Court, affect threes Federally-matched pro­

the statutory issue of 42,000(d).

violate equal protection if it’s applied equally.

Thank you, Mr. Flam.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY ANTHONY B. CHINO, ESQ.
13

MR. CHZMG:

1
2

Mr. Chief

-Justice and way it please

the Courts
I would like to at this time reply very briefly

3
4

to the reply brief submitted by the Appellant.

The Appellant

S

apparently felt that one of the arguments raised in the

6

Appellees6 brief; the argument that the same would b© accom­

1

plished by the treaties mad® by the United States, namely the

0

U.N. Charter and the charter of the OAS, since 'that argument

9

was not raised in the Court below we should not raise it here.
In reply to that argument I would like to point

10

1!

out to this Court that it is a general Appellate rule that any

12

decision by a lower court should be affirmed if there is any

13

basis or ground to affirm that decision, even if the opinion

14

of the case would rely on grounds not otherwise raised in the

15
16
17
18

19
20
21

22
23
24
25

court, below.
This is different than the Appellees' position,
which is: you can reverse the case on the basis of a ground
which has not been established below.

In other words, the

lower court had no opportunity to review that claim and some­
how the result would have been different.

And to support my

theory there are two cases decided by this Court very squarely
in point, and these cases are:

Helgrin versus Gowran,

G-o-w-r-a-n, in 302 u.S. 238 end Securities and Exchange
Commission versus Tony Corporation (?) 31C U.S. 80.
The Appellees raise four different grounds for
14

1

affirmance of the decision below.

z

in this argument.

I will discuss each of them

The first basis for affirming the decision is that

3
4

the United States Government has on several occasions entered

5

into multilateral treaties with other nations and particularly

S

the United Nations!Charter, which governs this country the

7

same as any other treaty.

8
9
10

This was the view advanced in an

earlier case argued before this Court in Rice versus Sioux City,
Cemetery case which 1 cite in ray brief and the Court on
reviewing has said that that argument was not without merit.
We not© that the United States is a leader of the

n
12

free world and that everything that we do reflects very

13

seriously on our posture abroad.

14

are allowed to discriminat® against aliens, nationals of ©idler

15
16

17

countries who are invited to com© to this country under our
immigration powers, they would weaken our posture before the
other nations.
And for this reason the states should not be

18
19

20

allowed to conflict with the national interest and the public
policy ©£ the United States Government.
And more particularly, it seems it's established

21

22
23
24
25

Specifically if the states

that most of the aliens in Arizona are aliens of Mexican
origin.

We are bound by the treaty called 'the Charter of the

Organisation of American Statos and the earlier charter cited
in nay brief specifically provided for equal treatment of all
15

1

persons within the respective jurisdictions

z
3

Q

Do they have a right to vote in the United

A

As far as the right to vote — the alien's

States?

4

S

right to vote concern it raises two different issues , which

s

neither of fcheia are before the Court in this case.

7

if the Court wishes I. will very briefly discuss that.

8

First of all, as to ~

9

Q

However,

My whole point i«s I think if you get to

10

cases in this Court, at least so far as I am concerned, you

11

would do much better than you will so far as I am concerned,

12

about the United Nations, Charter, which says specifically: It

13

shall not apply to the internal affair;;.; of any ©f its

14

assignees.

15
16
17

13

*i

A

I'm aware of that, however, in Oyama

against California, again cited before this Court, four of the
justices of this Court felt that the United Nations Charter
has some relevancy to the disposition of this case.

19

Q

Why don't the —

20

A

Mr® Justice Whits# I didn't quite follow

21

22

your question.

You say the charter requires aliens to foe

treated like a citizen in all respecte? is that your argument?

Yes *
That's not treating them vary equally

with -the citizens? is it?

to the countries, as spoken by Mr. .justice Marshall.

S

Q

7

You mean the charter covers everything and

8

that the treaty covers everything except what is inti* «tent in

9

A

10

Exactly, plus the: fact that deportation is

11

an expression of Congressional powers.

12

states who are attempting to exercise powers that are in con­

13

flict with the Federal policy*

14

established by treaties by the Federal Government.
0

15

We deal here with

And the Federal policy is

Well, anyway, there is some way the treaty

16

doesn't keep the United States from treating aliens

17

differently?
A

18

■'

This raises a host, ©f other problems that

19

I am not prepared at this time to get into about the standing

20

to raise Congressional statutes which may be unconstitutional.
I will now argue 'the Equal Protection argument,

21

22

which I believe is our chief argument, which is the argument

23

sustained by the Court below in rendering the favorable

24

decision.

25

there is no question in ray mind that., based on previous

Although the argument was listed last in my brief,

17
i

I

decisions of this Court that the Equal Protection Clause does

2

apply to aliens.
The only argument that is raised Mr, Flam is that

3
4

for some reason the. states can discriminate against a so-

5

called special public interest.

6

has really articulated what that interest is, other than the

saving or money.

I don't believe ‘that Mr. Flam

.

We do have a classification in this cage.

8

of all, there are two classes: A and B.

9

First

A would b© citizens

10

of the United States who are residing in Arizona and B would

11

be the resident aliens in Arizona.

12

classes.

And under B there are two

First those aliens who have lived in Arizona for

15 years or more — who have lived in the United States for

13
14

15 years or more and two: those who have not 3.1 vad in the

15

United States for 15 years.

16

Q

Mr. Cfeing if the 15 years requirement were

sis months would yon still bo here?

17

A

18

Yes, because it still discriminatos against

the alien resident under the Equal Protection Clausa.

You would feel necessarily then that the

states would not have a proper interest in requiring a six-

21

months residency?

Unless the state can show that the six

months period is necessary for -them to evaluate the eligibility

of an alien.

In that case I would say that why is it that it,

18

?

would take less time to evaluate the eligibility of &- citizen.

As I see it, to determine eligibility is something which you

have to do for both aliens and citizens alike and certainly

What has the

Federal Government said about

tills matter?
A

19

'The Social Security Act, as argued by Mr.

11

Flam, is not expressly in point.

It permits the. state, under

12

th® interpretation placed by HEW in the handbook provisio;! -for

13

.the states to enact requirements of residency or to —

14

Q

That4s residency in the United States?

13

A

Yes, or to deny aliens from any benefits

10

17
18

entirely.

The statute is not a mandatory one in that th®

statute may permit them to so discriminate.

2 would submit

that furthermore the statute is being permissive and secondly

19

that Congress can no more authorize the states to violate

20

equal protection than the state can violate equal protection.

21

22
23
24
23

This is the precise language reach-ad by this
Court in Shapiro v. Thompson.
Q

Are you suggesting that what Congress has

don© is as vulnerable as what the state has done?
A

Yes.

This issue was before this Court as tc

19

i

the duration of the residency requirement for all persons in

2

Shapiro v. Thompson and the Congressional Act provided the

3

states may enact duration of residency requirements Q

4

And —*

So that the Social Security Act expressly

5

said that: “We shall finance no plans that include aliens."

6

You would say that would be unconstitutional?
A

7

I would say that would violate the Equal.

8

Protection Act.

9

would be: how the Congress would regulate immigration and if

The argument, as a matter of fact, of course

10

Congress has exercised that power and expressly provided that

11

as part ©f the immigration schema that aliens should not get

12

welfare.

13

lished that and if was made into an overall scheme to .

14

regulate immigration then that may be supportable to the

And if the Congressional history adequately estab­

standing ©f our argument as to the preemption aspects of
Federal law over state law.
However, that is not supportable under ©ur Equal
Protection argument.
I would go on now to the interests? affected. The
interests affected by the operation of -the Arizona Act is a
very, very serious interest, as Mr. Justice Marshall observed
earlier: those people may well starve.

Thase ;ara people who

came to the country by permission of the Federal Government
.on invitation.

These people came here and for some reason

they became destitute.

And the public system, such as Old Age
20

1

or Aid to the Disabled as sought by the Appel2.ee here# is

2

something to barely keep a person going.

3

vital as compared to the interest of the state, the interest

4

of the individual must prevail.

The interest is

The argument that the state is trying to save

5

Q

part of a sinking ship is not convincing to me.

We all know

7

that if you are on a sinking ship and you had to throw some-

8

b ody overboard in order to keep it afloat, the question who

9

who will you throw overboard?

The State's arguments say you

10

throw the alien overboard because tills Court had allowed the

11

states to do so.

12

authorised the state to do that and 1 think to throw aliens

13

overboard without morale?) is unconstitutional,* to say the

14

least.

IS

I don't think that tills Court has really

There is a greater obligation on the part of the

16

State Government or the Federal Government, based on ©

17

humanitarian interest to see if we can s&v® and protect ©very

13

person, even "'though if everybody may get by with still lass.

19

To arbitrarily, to use the phrase "selfishnessH to just pre­

20

serve one's immediate family and throw other people to the

21

wolves is not a type of doctrine that will survive today when

22

the existence of mankind depends on the cooperation of every­

23

body and net a self-interest to protect one's immediate sur­

24

rounding members.

25

Q

What lesser obligations do aliens have in
21

1

the country than citizens?
A

2

The aliens have, just by all indications I

3

can think of, being an alien myself at one time, I will say

4

that the aliens pay all taxess property taxes, income tax,

5

sales tax? the aliens are subject to the draft and military

6

service; they are working from their work -they pay taxes, but

h

Ho, unless it would view the exercise of

the right to vote as an obligation rather than a right.

And

the aliens do not vote.
Q

And hew does the state get away with that?

A

Well, I believe —- again, it is not before

this Court — I believe that as to

election is purely local

in nature, which affects the interest of an alien? for
example, a bond issue which would affect his property tax.
And if that alien could not become a U. S. citizen solely
because of the language requirement I would say that to deny
the persons the right to vote may well b<3 unconstitutional.
As to elections for national officers or the
national government where the alien's loyalty to another
country may color his vote, I would say that can be sustained,

the denial of the right to vote»

But that is not before this Court today,

O

Q

Well# are you suggesting that there could

4

be classifications among aliens that some would have a right

S

to vote and some would not? depending on the place of origin?

6

A

No? 18m saying that depending on the

7

interests affected.

In other words# if the election is on the

8

question of whether or not your taxes on your home would be

9

increased to pay for new schools? an alien owner of a home

10

cannot vote and yet fe© is subject to the tax»

time due to other considerations I would say that that denial
may well be unconstitutional.
But this is not before this Court,
Q

Well# Mr, Ching# how about this -— I c&n'fc

remember whether Congress has this provision or not# but if an
alien is admitted 2 take it -that it's because ~ one of the
reasons is that he is not going to be a public charge?
A

Yes.

Q

What if he is admitted and later he becomes

a public charge?
A

Is he then subject to deportation?
Ho.

The statute# as cited in my brief#

provided that for deportation as to causes arising-Before they
com© and not as to causes after.
23

Q

Yes.

Well, what if Congress did provide

that that if your entrance is conditioned on remaining selfsupporting?
A

I would say that would be a valid exercise

of '.she Congressional power to regulate foreign commerce,
naturalisation and immigration, if that is made part of the

scheme to .legislate in this area.
That type of legislation as to aliens who, subseuqent to the granting of visas

,

become residents of the

United States, whether or not that provision violates the
equal protection is something that I can only speculate.

It

is time that this Court will have to talc® it up on another
occasion.

That will be a question between the on® power of

Congress versus another power.

The same situation as to

whether or not that provisio?* would violate a treaty.
Maybe the possible variation would be some inter­
national tribunal? I don't know.

This has been speculated by

people who are writing legal treatises

„

but I can only give

~ the answers today.
Q

Well, if you say that it would have a

bearing to have a right possibly to vote for taxation purposeswhy wouldn't you go to the nexfc step cind say you had a right to
vote for national officers to determine what the income tax is
going to be.

Where are you going to atop?

such as was true in Rice, Tick W© and the latest case of this

Court in Takahashi versus California Fish and Game Commission,

20

very clearly show that the states car.: longer deny aliens

We are 'arguing that the state statute violates

X under:- •

and McCall, which emm out the same year as Truax versus Raich

mui

pie versus Crane.
'

25

These are cases decided

1

inranofcher day and age based on the right, privilege

2

dichotomy and 1 do not believe that these cases should be

3

used as authorities for this Court today and that these cases

4

should foe overruled.

5
6

Third, we have position arguments, including the
since
preemption argument that/the Federal Government had provided

7

for immigration and naturali nation under the Federal Coheres

8

powers and under the power- to •'•.regulate immigration, and

©

naturalisation, the state can no more enter the area because

10

it conflicts with the national policy of the Supremacy Clause.

11

Here we have got several cases of this Courts the

12

Fong Yeu Ting case and the case of Hines versus Davidowitz on

13

the point.
Further, we have Congressional statutes in point

14

15

governing -the Equal Protection Clause with the Civil .Sights

16

Act of 1970 which is now in 42 USC 1981 and that statute was

17

cited with approval in

___________ and the Takahashi case

as providing for equal treatment of all persons, including

19

aliens.

20

persons within thejurisdiction of the United States, must be

21

22
23
24
25

That statute was very specific and said that all

subject to the same laws and the full and equal benefits from
all laws.
And in addition to the Civil Rights Law of '64
and 42 USC 2000(d), it is our position that the decision ©f
the lower court can be sustained on «my and all grounds
26

1

raised by our brief»

And that there are cases squarely in

2

point from precedents decided by this Court and that therefore

3

we urge that this Court affirm the decision rendered by the
