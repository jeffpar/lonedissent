ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. THOMPSONMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

8

Court. This is an appeal by Leg Angeles County District Attor­

9

ney Evelle Younger arid the People of the State of California,

10

from a judgement in order of a Three Judge District Court in

II

the Central District -of California declaring unconstitutional

'i 2

on their face each section of the California Criminal Syndical­

13

ism Act Penal Code sections 11400-11402, and erijoining appell­

14

ant Younwer from continuing with a pending prosecution aerainst

15

anpellee John Harris Jr.

16

"■ On September 20 „ 1966, appellee Harris wap indicted on Sec

17

11401 sub 3 for two violations of the Syndicalism Act for dis­

18

tributing literature advocating crime as a means of effecting

iB

political and eco'nonic change.

2©

Mr. Harris demurred to the Indictment and moved to quasi

21

it in the state courts. He sought Writ of Prohibition in the

22

Intermediate Appellate Court and petitioned for a hearing in

23

the State Supreme Court. As we will argue later, in none of

24

those cases did he adequately present his constitutional issue

25

to the State Appellate Courts nor did he get a determination e
3

1

evan from the trial court that the statute was constitutional

2

in the form in which it was approved hare in Whitney»

3

In the summer of 1967, Mr, Harris repaired to the Federal

4

Courts, having been thwarted in the State Courts. Fe was

5

joined here by three additional plaintiffs, A temporary re~

6

s&^iis&ni reorder was issued in August of 1967. Since that time

7

the s«se has languished in the Federal Courts, That is over

8

three years. The District Court held that it had jurisdiction

9

to pass on every section of the Act bv. reason of the presence

10

of .Mr. Harris and appellees Dan and Hirsh who as members of the

11

Progressive Labor Party, urged that they were inhibited in the

12

peaceful advocacy of that parties’ program by the Act and by

13

the Harris prosecution. And by the presence of the plaintiff

14

Bros laws Icy who as a history teacher urged or alleged in his

15

cOWolaint that, the presence of the Act inhibited him in his

IS

customary practice of teaching about the doctrines of Karl Marx,

17

The court held that it had jurisdiction to review each

18

section of the Act. It held that Dombrowski vs, Pfister mandat­

19

ed a. declaratory judgement invalidating each and every section,

20

of the Act. It further held that the appellate vounaer should

21

be. enjoined from continuing the prosecution which had been star­

22

ted the preceding year.

23

. Out contentions to fches Court are these; first, that the

24

District Court did not have jurisdiction to pass on all sec­

25

tions of that statute, that except for the section under which
4

?

Harris was charged there was no case or controversy with re­
2
8
4
5

6

spect to ail other sections of the statute.
Secondly; that the District. Court abused its discretion
by refraining from abstaining and by declaring the statute
unconstitutional on its face.
Thirdly, that the Smith Act does not pre-empt the Syn­

7

dicalism Act. We think that: that is a self evident proposition

8

which requires no elaboration here.

9

Fourthly,, that the Federal Anti-Injunction Stttute 28

io

USC 2283 bars the injunction issued here against the pending

n

prosecution.

12

And finally we ur

that the State Statute is consti­

13

tutional . Not in the form in which it was approved in Whitney

U

or condemned in Brandenburg. We have never urged that that stat­

15

ute was constitutional as it appeared here in Whitney but that

16

it is constitutional in the light of na®rowing State Court

17

decisions decided between Whitney and Brandenburg. And we would

18

urge also that if the Federal Court disagree with thatp that if

19

it chooses to interpose itself voluntarily between State Legis­

20

latures and State Courts, that it. has an obligation to act like

21

a State Court and

22

the Federal District Court acted in the Macke11 case.

23

uphold that statute in the manner in which

To proceed, then, to the jurisdictional point. Ouy pro­

24

position that the Court lacked jurisdiction with all provisions

25

excppt for 11401 sub 3 rests of two propositionsi. The first is
5

1

that the mere existence of a statute regulating free speech or

2

association as; opposed to its enforcement does not exude such

S

a "chilling effect" as to give rise to a, case or controversy

4

under Article 3 section 2. Now there were some who thought that

5

Dombrowdki held otherwise. But that, notion should have been

6

removed by this Courts' holding in Golden against Zwickler,

7

and subsequently in Mitchell against Donovan. If we had any

8

other result, of course,. Federal Courts would spend a great

5

deal of time, even more than they now do - renderi ng advisory

1©

opinions on rather troublesome questions of constitutional

11

law,, many of which need never be litigated.

12

Our second proposition is that plaintiffs Dan, Hirsh, and,
i

13

Broslawsky do not. present a case or controversy. Now the

14

standard is articulated as recently as Golden against Zwickler.

15

Quoting Maryland Casualty against Pacific Coal says that "The

16

question is whether under all the circumstances here there is

17

a substantial controversy between parties having adverse legal

IS

interests of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant issu­

w

ance of a declaratory judgement." And we are also mindful of

20

Mu. Justice Frankfurters9 pronouncement in Sommunist Parties

21

vs. Subversive Activites Control Board, that mere potential im­

22

pairment of constitutional rights under a statute does not

23

create a justitiable controversy in which the nature and extent

24

of those rights raey be litigated. That is the standard.

25

The allegations are as I have said. Ban and Hirsh as
6

1

members of the Progressive Labor Party feel inhibited by the

2

presence of the Act. Mr. Broslawsky as a history teacher some­

3

how alleges that he is inhibited by the presence of the Act

4

and the prosecution. We think these allegations are frivolous.

5

We point out that there are no overt acts by the State,

8

there were no arrests, no searches, no seizures, no accusa­

7

tions, no threats of prosecution directed 'toward Dan, toward

8

Hirsh, toward BrowslawskyP or toward any person who was engaged

9

in a similar errant conduct, and we invite the Courts“ attention

10

to, in effect, the .finding of the District Court who in their

11

opinion did say we are under no apprehension that Dan, Hirsh,

12

and Broslawsky stand in any danger of prosecution by reason

13

of the activities ascribed themselves in their complaint. So

14

we think that those allegations do not give rise to justiciable

15

controversy under Article 3 section2.

18

Mow do we think the fact that the Sistrict Court had

17

jurisdiction to pass on one section entitled it to conduct a

18

search and destroy mission on our Penal Code.

19

First, that statute contains a severability clause. The

20

legislature clearly stated that if it could not have all that

21

it wanted, then it wanted all that it could have.

22

Secondly, fctcontained different kinds of acts. Mot all

23

the subprovisions are free speech provisions. 11401 sub 1 is

24

directed toward advocacy, subsection 3 toward circulation of

25

literature, subheetion 4 toward organising and membership.
7

1
2

And subsection 5 involves crimes. It has nothing to do with
speech, it is a pure conduct statute yet the District Court

3

felt that it was warranted to pass on all those statutes.

4

What we're asking the Court to do, then, is to take the section

5

by section approach that was done in the Smith Act.

6

We think 'that any contrary view that to say that once

7

the District Court has its foot, in the door it can pass on

8

everything* in sight just

&

justitiability which underlines the Article three requirement.

ignores the principle of

W

And they are that an informed decision can only result from

11

a case which is contested between people having real interests.

IS

And all we have in this case is an uninformed decision by the

13

District Court on overlooking a host of State decisions which

14

are on point.

IS

Our second point is that the District Court abused its

IS

deaeration in refusing to abstain in declaring a statute un-

17

constituional. The fact is the District Court in one sense

IS

did not exercise its descretion at all. It didn't think it had

19

any. It said we may not abstain. Because this is a statute

20

which is overbroad and which regulates free speech and Bom™

21

browski tells us we must act. Our position is that where we

22

can show the special circumstances present in this case, there

23

can be no finding of irrepairable injury necessary to

24

an injunction and there is no warrand tot declaring the state

25

statute unconstitutional.
3

issue

1

How those factors are these: number one, the state statute

2

is sisceptible of a narrowing construction indeed, our position !

3

is that that construction was placed on it as early as 1946 by a;

4

state decision by Justice Trainer, which we think anticipated,

5

if it did not inspier the formulation in Brandenburg,

6

Secondly there is a pending vehicle, the Harris prosecu­

7

tion which if it is allowed to proceed, in 1370, can lead to

8

the kind of determination which resulted in the Macke11 case,

9

and which will provide a limiting construction for that statute.

10

One which will permit this Court to avoid the very difficult

11

sublet of constitutional questions, namely, what are the

12

Federal limitations of state power.

13

Thirdly,

there is an absence of bad faieh enforcement,

14

in this case. There rre no allegations in the complatin, let

15

alone demonstration that the state preceded against Mr. Harris

16

without hope of convicting him simply to discourage him from

17

exercising his protected rights.

18

Tha advantages of abstention, I think, are many and fam­

19

iliar, First, if tiie state court invalidates a statute, we

20

avoid a direst Fedeasai afront to state sovereignty. Our state

21

courrs are quite capable of doing that if the constitution

22

demands it. They did it as recently as Vogel against the County

23

of Los Angeles, cited by the District Court in the authority of

24

—-Keeishan invalidated a state employee loyalty oath which was

25

required by our state constitution.
9

1

Alternatively, the State Court may provida the limiting

2

construction which allows this Court and other Courts to avoid

3

the substantive constitutional issues. It avoids the kind

4

of delay we’ve experienced in this case, where the case has

5

remained here for years. Nov? I recognise that there are some

6

exceptional circumstances but this is not the first case like

7

this to he in the Federal system for three years. Sell against

8

Patterson is another example of such a delay. This Courts8

9

calendar today I think illustrates the increased burden or?, the

m

Federal Courts which result from an interventionist position.

i?

That burden shoudd be transferred to the State Courts.

12

Among other reasons that will engourage them to assume

13

full responsibility for protecting Federal rights and not to

14

abdicate the field on the assumption that if we don’t handle

13

it the Federal Courts will have to resolve it. And ultimately

1©

State Courts are not only the ultimate arbiters of State law,

17

they are the best arbiters. They are more familiar with it?

18

they know what they're doing. This opinion has to be a very

19

curgent example of that principle.

20

And finally there is a perhaps somewhat novel cansider-

21

ation that we urge, In our view the abstention doctrine and the

22

no-rewriting maxim — that is that this court and Federal

23

Courts do not have the obligation to construe state statutes,

24

to the extent that they must construe Federal statutes —■ are

25

doctrines which have to co-exist or cannot exist al all. Bofeh
10

!

were authored by Justice Frankfurter . The no-rewriting maxim

2

is in a sense a luxury and it can only be enjoyed because of

O
**■>

abstention. If you abandon the abstention doctrine, then you

4

have to assume the responsibility for acting like a state court,

s

and doing what, the state court would do to save its statute.

6

We think that '"hat is implicit in your courts language and in

7

Fox against Washington. So, in a sense the abstention then

0

confers another benefit. It allows you to avoid that very dif­

9

ficult responsibility.

10

To proceed, then, to -the special circumstances -which we

n

think mandate abstention in this case. Wow as to the sus­

12

ceptibility of this statute to a saving construction. First,

13

the guidelines for that construction have already been pro­

14

vided in this Courts® opinion. In Brandenburg against Ohio and

IS­

in the Smith Act cases, Dennis, Yeates, Scales, and Melville.

IS

Secondly, there can be no doubt but that the California

17

acts would faithfully apply that guideande. The District Court

18

recognized that when it said that the California Courts reg­

1§

ularly have shown full allertness to the constitutional re-

20

quitements and to the decidions of this Court. In effect, our

21

statute comes before this Court in the same posture that the

22

Smith Act did and that was susceptible of a limiting construc­

23

-

24

25

tion. However, we think that ours has even been more limited.
As to the bad faith aspect, unquestionably, a showing of
bad faith enforcement is essential to demonstrate the irrepair11

j

1
2
S
4

able injury necessary to warrant injunctive relief» Now we
have injunctive relief here, and bad faith was not shown»
But we think that it is also a circumstance to be considered
on the question of declaratory judgement» Where the statute is

>-

r

vague, it offers the- possibility that state officials may take
advantage of that vagueness to expand the scope of the statute
to include protected conduct whish they personally disfavor,
Whan that occurs, abstention may be mandated» It did not hap­
pen here, as it happened in Bombrowski„
We do not have the arrests, search and seizures, a futile
attempt to vindicate state federal rights in the state courts
as occured in Los Angeles in our case» None of that is present
here. We think this court has recognized this, albeit somewhat
cryptically, in the affirmances in Brooksagainst Briley, and in

IS

Wells against Reynolds, particularly the Wells case. That inr-

10

volved the District. Courts determination not to declare uncon­

17

stitutional a Georgia Statute denouncing circulation of in-

18

surrectionist papers on the grounds that the statute could be

19

construed narrowly so as to save it from constitutional objec­

20

tion and because of an absence of bad faith.

21

was affirmed,

22

That holding

Now we recognise that this court in Zwickler against

23

Kouda drew a sharp dichotomy between declaratory and injunctive

24

relief, and to a certain extent we're urging and we do not

25

hesitate to urge the assimilation of the test fox* those two.
12

!

We agree with the laguuage of Hr» Justice Douglas in his dis­
sent in Mitchell against Donovan. Ordinarily a declatory judge-

3

ment invalidating a state statute does in fact result in the
same quantum of interference and disruption of state proced.

lags as does an injunction» If that is true then the criteria
6

for determining whether you ahve a declaratory judgement or

7

an injunction ought to be the same. And if that requires a

8

reconsideration of Zwickler, then that’s valid. We think that-- •

Q.

Section 2283, it refers to an injunction, but not to .

a declaratory judgement. Are you asking us to read the statute
ft
12

13

to equate—-inj unction?
A

No, Your Honor, I'm saying that the statute relfects

a policy of noninterference with the states.

14

Q.

And that the policy shoudd include injunctions?

15

A

That's right. And say that the statute satisfies

16

the relationship between the states and the Federal Government

17

beeause the court only issues a declaratory judgement instead

18

of an injunction has got to be that final exaltation of form

VB

over substance. We have been without this statute for all

20

practical purposes for three years. There has been no injunc­

21

tion against future prosecutions, only against the prosecution

22

of appellee Harris. And we haven’t got our statute. Now we

203

think that the —

24

Q.

Have you missed it vary much?

25

A

Well, I think. Justice Stewart, that if you read the

13

1

California papers and follow the almost daily bombings and

2

police assassinations «and other things that we're familiar---

3
4
S

0,

There are a good many other statutes that cover that

sort of conduct, I presume, aren't there?
S.

They punish it onee it has occured. The problem

8

is that .not only in California but in New York and other states

7

its quite obvious that statutes 'which punish conduct like that,

8

which has algeady occured are not enough to do the job. There * s

fi

no question about that» I mean, if you've got to wait until

10

the breach has occured, then enforcement is really hopeless.

1!

We'll just have to weed them out and accept whatever punishment

12

that's going to be dealt out, which is going to be considerable.

13

Now the third factor in this case is that unlike, many

14

of the cases there is a pending vehicle in which 'the statute

IB

can be construed. Now that wasn't true in Keeishan, it wasn't

18

true in Zwickier, it wasn't true in a lot of cases where ab­

17

stention was deemed inappropirate, Now the appellee has taken

18

the position that if fact this is not all an abstention case,

10

but the state courts either did pass on the state statute or

20

had an opportunity and failed to do do. and therefore the Fed­

21

eral court had refrained from declaring our statute unconsti­

22

tutional, it would be abdication rather than abstention.

23

Now I want to answer 'that because it is not in the briefs

24

and it was not until reargument last term, that we understood

25

that there had been a mutual misapprehendion of the state law

14

1

2

on that point
In the state trial court Mr» Harris demurred the indict­

3

ment under Penal Code Section 395. The state trial court said

4

the motion to quash is denied and the denmrr is overruled.

5

That statute is constitutional. But the state trial court had

6

before it memoranda referring to Scales, Dennis, Yeates, and

7

sbfisa California decisions so its determination which pertained

8

only to one section under which Harris was charged was not a

9

..finding that the statute was constitutional as it appeared

10

here in Whitney* but in light of what, we think, the con­

11

structions that could be placed on it» And then -the state trial

12

court—if it ever gets to the point where it can issue instrue™

13

tions to the j ary“-that is where we will find reflection of the

14

judicial gloszi

15

In all events Mr, Harris then sought a Writ of Prohi­

16

bition from the intermediate Appellate Court pursuant to Penal

17

Code Section 99a, We have two Writs of Prohibition in California

18

One is a 999a Writ, the other is a civil cods procedure 1152

19

Writ. The former does nothing but give an accused an opportun­

20

ity to have an appellate Court review a

21

mination on the question of probable cause» Is there a &«£■'

22

ficient quantum of evidence to make the man go to

23

is all. It does not raise constitutional issuer.

superior courts deter­

That

24

Harris5 complaint is that he preceded with that vehicle.

25

So what he is saying is that the Courts cannot abstain because

12

I presented, 1 elected the wrong remedy in the state courts
by which to present my constitutional claims,
Ha then preceded to the California Supreme Court with a
petition for hearing. It was denied. That is discretionary,
there3s no question about that. And if he had selected the cor­
rect remedy—the Writ of Prohibition provided for by 1102—
our position is that that also would have been discretionary.
It is certainly clear that a denial of a Writ of Prohibition
is not a ruling of the merits in California.
Now the scope of discretion in a state court on a Writ
of Prohibition under 1102 is something of a murky question.
No one is really clear# and I don’t know ifthe state courts

13

are. But we think the obscurity of that question should demon­

14

strate to this court that for federal courts either to say that

15

abstention is proper or improper according to v?hather the man

16

has presented the constitutional claim in a pre-trial setting

17

is only to enmesh the federal courts in determinations of some­

18

times very difficult questions of state procedural law. They

19

ought not to do it, because its not a proper basis at all.

2©

Now finally we arrive at the anti-injunction statute.

21

After Atlantic Coastline last term, Federal District Court can

22

no longer enjoin a prosecution in spite of the stttuta on the

23

theory that it’s merely a .legislative enactment of the Comity

24

Principle, It must bring it within a specific exception.

25

Now here it's clear that the District Court did not enter

1

its injunction against Mr. Younger in aid of its jurisdiction

2

or to effectuate its judgement. In fact it has told us why it

o

did, that was to insure that we would have an appeal to this

4

court under 1253, Of course, it could have done that by simply

5

enjoining future prosecutions, which would be tolerable under

S

Dombrowski and Hammer but it did not, Sothe question then

7

becomes whether or not this injunction can be justified because

8

the suit is under the Civil Rights Act,

9

Now whether 42 USC 1983 is a specific exception to 2283,

'10

Our position is that it isn’t. That if it were,

11

:the rule. And you would have a situation where state court

12

prosecutions could be interrupted while defendants repaired

13

to the federal courts for any alleged violation of due process.

14

It8s hard to know where they would stop. So we think that the

15

language of that statute which is rather plain means what it

16

says,- and bars the injundtion.

17

would ergulf

Now as to the constutitionality of the Act itself, I would

18

repeat that the Act is not before this Court in the form in

19

which it appeared in the Whitney case. Brandenburg does not

20

dispose of the: merits of this case. Out position is that our

21

statute has been, construed by the state courts fco conform to

22

the requirements of Brandenburg,

23

In 1946 Chief Justice Trainer said that the Criminal

24

Syndicalism Act could be applied only when there is eminent

25

danger that the advocacy of the doctrines which cease to pro­
ll

1

hibit will give-rise to the evils that the state mey prenett.

2

We think that was the inspiration for the test in Brandenbutg.

3

Certainly it satisfies it. Of course the words of Justice

4

7

In 1920 we had a decision in People vs Mailey. That case said

8

that you had to intend the unlawful consequences resulting

9

from your advocacy. There was a literature case. In fact it

fO

involved the very section at issue in the District Court pro­

m

ceeding. It was, of course, not cited or referred to by the

12

District Court. It did say that the person distributing lit­

13

erature must intend the consequences reasonably attributable to

14

his distribution.

15

Subsection four, is the organisational membership section.

16

These are discreet acts; you cannot organise, and that's con­

17

strued now in California meaning you have to be on the ground

18

floor, this Court recognized that in Yeats. You cannot organ­

W

ize an organisation without being active in it and without

2©

having a knowledge and intention that its unlawful purposes be

21

fulfilled. By no stretch of the imagination is that a status

22

crime. The requirements of activeemsmbership, it goes beyond

23

the requirements of active membership set down in Scales and

24

similar statutes.

fcional and finally, just to reiterate that if a Federal Court

;

reaches those, if it chooses to interpose itself between the
State Court and the state legislature., that it has a respon­
sibility to do to the statute what the § ate Court thinks it
would do. That responsibility was discharged by the New York
State Court. It, was not here. We are just unable to reconcile
those results. We don't think that sufficient discretion re­
poses in the District Courts to reach those opposite results.
And if their discretion is that wide then discretion is simply
a softer word for arbitrary.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. WIRIN: Hr; Chirf Justice, and may it please the Court.
First to deal quickly, as far as my time is concerned with the
question put by Justice Stewart to fir. Thompson. In the appel­
les opening brief we cite a gross or so of California statutes
which penalize not only acts of violence but threats of violence
and in a brief which is gold colored, called Appellees Sup­
plemental Brief on Reargument, at pa4fe 17, in a footnote—it has
been said that the heart of many of the opinions of this Court
are in footnotes, but that is an aside—-anyway, on page 17
in the footnote which begins on page 16, footnote 17a, we cite
a statute in California which makes it a crime to incite to
19

\

tiot. There need be no actual violence, merely an incitement

2

to riot, is a crime in California as it is in many states.
Now, secondly, with respect to another issue, with which

3
4

1 think I can deal quickly, it is true as Hr. Thompson has

5

stated to Your Honors, that in the suit filed in the District

<8

Court in California there were four plaintiffs, three in ad­

7

dition to appellee Harris, and to none of the plaintiffs ,

8

with the exception of Harris, we admit there is no direct threat

8

of prosecution,

made by the District Court-- •

18

Q.

19

A.

An order of preliminary injunction.
Was made totally for the benefit of and with re­

20

spect to the appellee Harris. Wa think all of the appellees

21

except Harris are not proper ajbjbellees in this Court. And we

22

think that. Your Honors have said that—

23
24

25

Q.

Because of the—declaratory judgement. Is that

JL

That’s right. Because no injunction was issued after

right?

20

1

2
3
4

then and no cleci&tory judgement was issued because the Court
hadn’t taken jurisdiction of the merits of the case, in order
to declare the rights, though I will get to that later.
In any -event, it is our view that under the gun case

E

decided by Your Honors last term, and in view as I said in one

6

of my briefs prior to Your Honors ruling, they are not proper

7

appellees and the question as to whether or not there is a jus-

8

titiable controversy between these other three plaintiffs and

8

the appellant we think is not an issue which Your Honore need

10

reach and certainly we do not press.

11

Which brings me to discuss feha

which are before

n

Your Honors. And that is first, 1 am going to try to avoid for

13

Your HOnors in this session to repeat the arguments I made last

14

year which was bottomed largely on the First Amendment, for I

15

realize now, more than I clia then, that there are issues in

18

this court which need to be resolved favorable to the appellee

17

Harris, long before the First Amendment'is reached by this

18

Court, and these issues, with respect to which I must conceed,

W

I gave summary consideration in my argument, namely the appli­

20

cability of section 2283 and the problem of abstention are the

21

core issues to which I want to address myself.

22

I of course recall Justice Brennan —* I mean not since

23

he hears so many lawyers argue — his admonition to me that I'd

24

better meet the problem of section .2283 before long and then

25

my time ran out before 1 gave it the kind of consideration
21

1
£

S
8

which 1 think I can give it this morning« Now we agree, of
course, that before we can prevail I think — by we, I mean
Harris can prevail — we have to successfully cross the thresh™
old of 2283. And we think we have done it for the following
reasons, and incidentally I'm going to assume for the purpose
of my argument that the exceptions to section 2283 are not a

7
barred charter of rights exceptions to be narrowly construed —

I needn't say that X have in mind Your Honors decision of last
term —

we think the injunction issued in this case comes

within the sections specifically provided for byCongress in
section 2283.
First, we think that the preliminary injunction in this
special circumstance of the posture of the case as it presented
itself before the Three Judge Court below, if the injunction
was in aid of the jurisdiction of the Federal Court, and to
borrow and to use and to accept the face of this court was
necessary in the aid of that jurisdiction and to affect—
judgement.
And that is because of the following? The matter came on
before the District Court on a motion to dismiss the indictment.
I‘in mis-stating mydslf. A motion to dismiss the complaint,
of a motion by the State.
0

There had been a denrarr to the indictment in the

State court, but you’re not talking about that..
A

I'm talking about the jurisdiction and the provident
22

1

by the Bistrice Court»

2

Q,

By the Federal District Court»

3

A,

1 co expect to reach the problems in the State Court,

4

time permitting. But in the Federal Court the posture of the

5

was that a complaint had been filed urging that the Statute

6

was unconstitutional under the Federal Civil Rights Act and the

7

defendant, the appellant here, Younger, had filed a motion to

8

dismiss» So all the District Court had before it was a motion,

9

to dismiss and 1 say all because I mean it did not have the

10

case before it on the merit. The case wasn't ready for an ad­

If

judication, declaratory judgement or otherwise, on the merits»

12

-- -motion to dismiss» The Court determined to overrule the

13

motion to dismiss.

14

Therefore, the next steps in the case would be the filing

IS

of some responsive pleading by the appellant here, the defen­

16

dant there, a responsive pleading which was never filed» It.

17

would pass that. Now it is our view that wholly aside from any

18

authority that the District Court had to issue an injunction,

19

it did have authority, particularly in the peculiar circum­

20

stances of this case by way of declaratory judgement to pass

21

upon this statute and to determin. whether on its face it is over

22

overbroad» Therefore, it had jurisdiction over the cause, and

23

continued to have jurisdiction over the cause rntil the merits

24

of the cause were before the District Court and. until the mer­

25

its of the cause, namely whether or not the Court should, by

way of declaratory judgement, determine whether or not the stattue was constitutional on its face, until it reached that point;
the Court had authority under section 2283 to issue intersti­
tial

penlentilite unjunctive relief which it did so as to

maintain its jurisdiction whatever the cost.
For if no preliminary injunction were issued, and assum­
ing it had jurisdiction ultimately by way of declaratory judge­
ment to decide the constitutionality of the statute —-for the
purpose of my present argument — if no preliminary injunction

j
■

issued, the jurisdiction of the District Court thereafter, af­
ter the defendant here filed responsive pleadings to adjudicate
the statute, would have been aborted, would have been mooted,

!

if the proceeding — setting aside the problems of abstention
which I'll come to in a moment — if the proceeding were allowed

15

to go forward in a State Court so in order, in our view to main-i

10

tain jurisdiction in order to protect and affect to it any

17

judgement — I!m now paraphrasing the language of section 2283—

18

which judgement it had jurisdiction to make -thereafter, we

19

think it had authority to issue this interstitial preliminary

20

imjunction until it could reach the merits.

21

Moreover, there is the civil—

22

Q.

23
24

25

Was there any effort by the State to move the case,

the State prosecution?

&

Well, you know, Your Honor, that's kind of a double

edged sword, but I'll take up the sword, nonetheless„

One edge at a time.

)l

One edge at a time. There was „ There was , in other

words, I mean the problems about abstention, in answer to Your
Honors question, I did, but I do. That is to say, the State
said it would go forward with the prosecution unless the Fed­
eral Court issued an injunction. So that if® felt that, there was
a necessity of some kind of.interstitial injunfctive ruling
under section 2283. Now additionally, as Your Honors know,
of course, because of your concern with this problem and the
ruling of Your Honors in the Atlantic case last term, we think
in your course, section 2283, in addition to the exceptions
which 1 have discussed also makes —— out of the section where
there is an Act of Congress. Now we think here, that there are
two Acts of Congress, 1 suppose one would be sufficient, if it
were sufficient.
One is the Civil Eights Act, which I do not propose to
argue in oral argument because I know it will be argued fully
in oral argument in cases following in the

extensively.

That statute confers jurisdiction on a Federal Court to grant
relief under the

Felsome Rights act at law in equity and in

any other manner and I suppose injunction is equity and so we
think that it is an exception. Moreover, we think it is not
accidental, on the contrary it is meaningful, that section 2283
of the 28 US Code follows section 2281 which predeeds section
2284 and those sections expressly confer jurisdiction upon a
25

i

federal Court to adjute a state statute to be unconstitutional.

2

That statute confers jurisdiction of a Federal Court to hold

3

a state statute unconstitutional, and to issue an injunctions,

4

where that statute is repugnant to the constitution»

5

Now the purpose of this suit, the thrust of the suit

6

filed in the District Court, is whether this statute is re­

7

pugnant to the Constitution because violating the First Amend­

8

ment. And so if Your Honors won't accept the four exceptions

9

which I have indicated 1 hope you'll find one of these excep­

,10

tions not wanting and therefore there has been a compliance

11

with section 2283» But even if section 2283, and as I say, I'm

12

giving you my argument, the exceptions are narrow rather than

13

broad,, or in attitude merely liberal in construction. As staining

14

we can palter and junp the hurdle of 2283 — if we can't we're

15

done for, so far as the injunction is concerned — but we think

16

we're not undone. But nonetheless there is the problem of ab­

17

stention and I would do a disservice to the Court as well as to

18

Hr, Harris if I stuck my head in the sand and didn’t recognise

19

the importance of that question and the importance to which this

20

Court has —— treated the question.

21

22

Q:

Q.

Did you aay you had filed a brief recently?

A

Your Honor, it depends on what recently——not this

term, but we filed two briefs last term. And in that connection,
24

Your Honor, I want to say something about the length of this

25

case and I know, I hope Your HOnors will not take umbridge at
26

I

what 1 say. This case has been in the Courts a long time, but

2

it has been virtually three years in this Court and it's not

3
4

a question of placing blame on anyone, but I'd better say that
I hope you won’t take it out on the appellee because of the

5

’’delay, there have been delays in this case due to the fact that

6

this Court has not been complete and there was ,also a delay in

7

the District Court I will conceed, because at that tiffin the

8

District Court had the matter, this Court had not ‘yet decided

9
10

Brandenburg, the District Court was confronted with the prob■
lem of anticipating what the present law was and ruled that

n

Whitney was no longer viable in view of other decisions of this

12

Court made that ruling prior to Brandenburg.

13

Now I deal with the problem of abstention. And if I

14

may say so, it seems- to me that this Court in declaring or

15

adjudging judicial policy as it does can control the prominent

IS

issues of injunctions or even deClatery judgements by the Dis­

17

trict Court through the judicial formula of abstention and

13

that m»®ter is that is entirely in Your Honors hands. Now for

19

the purposes of my argument, I'm going to assuerotthat if is

20

tie law — now I'm talking about, abstention as distinguished

21

from injunction— that there should be abstention only in

22

unusual cases. Because I think or I try to recognise that under

23

our system the Federal District Courts should intervene or

24

intercedeaalbe.it the rights which are ar afcake are in the First

25

Amendment, and heme® the most 3**~v~~tant.
27

The other special eir~

1

cumstance is that the statute is weenIhig on its face. It is
I

2

an old statute. It: has been on the statute books of California

3

for over fifty years. We have cited to Your Honors in our

#

i

4

i
i
briefs studies ehich have been made about the statute and ijts

S

enforcement, none of which argument has been challenged by jfche

6

prosecution. Professor Chaffee, .Professor Kirchw^v, of Col­

7

umbia Law school, "Professor Whittens, who was cited by Your

B

Honors as an authority in Brandenburg, all have come to the;

■9

view that this statute was aimed against the industrial work­

IQ

ers of the world-. That it has been a statute which in actuali

1!

i
enforcement hasT been ..cruel with respect, to which California1

12

and the entire nation ought to be 'thoroughly ashamed because

13

it was used soley for the purpose of supressing opinion.

i

:
i

14

So it is not a current statute adopted by the legis- i

IS

lature of the State of California to meet a current danger <br

18

need in California. It is an old statute for which I have had

17

i
nc favorable comment from any source except for the Attorned
i

18

General of California in the briefs in this case. Even in

1©

20

this case in order to enforce the statute the AttorneyGeneral
t
of California has annexed as exhibits to his opening brief!

m m'ETv.F OF APPELLANT

A,

If I may, Mr. Chisf Justice,, I'd like to make

,

6

two points. I think there is an illuminating passage in the

7

District Courts opinion. Xt8s the last full paragraph. The

8

District Court tells us, we believe, that our declaration that

9

the Act is unconstitutional on its face is all the relief that

10

is necessarv to be accorded the plaintiffs. That"s plural.

11

At this time. Inasmuch that we are confident that this decis­

12

ion standsf the defendant would adhere to it, I would refrain

IS

from further prosecutions under the Act. In the preeceding

14

paragraph, the Court sayg "Nor do we imply the.existence

15

of a likiihood that the courts of California ^oiild entertain

'16

such prosecutions if instituted." I think we should take the

17

District Courts5 word for it that they did not need to enter

18

that ini unction in order to protect either the iit jurisdiction

19

or cro effectuate thei£? judgement.

20

!€hev were quite clear about that, and they were equally

21

clear about hao many plaintiffs thev had before them. They

22

refer to plaimtiffs in the plural in their injunctive order,

23

which on its face tells us that the state statute is uncon­

24

stitutional , rnbe order appealed from. f1ow I

25

n0

The order onlv enjoins the prosecution of Harris{,
30

i

does it not?

Z

A.

That's correct, Your Honor,

3

0,

Your point is that the opinion is tantamount to

4

a declaratory judgement for the benefit of all of the plain­

5

tiffs as to the unconstitutionalitv of this Act as a whole?

6

A,

Precisely.

7

o.

The injunction itself is considerably narrower, is

8
9

it not? In that it refers to Harris?
A„

Yes it is, I think, however, that the District

10

Court would be craite surprised if they tounrt out that they had

u

given inadequate relief to all the plaintiffs before them,I
I

12

think they felt that there was no way to separate the two

13

questions of propriety, fcf injunctive relief and declaratory

14

relief because under Dombrowski in order to determine the

15

procedural question of whether or not to intervene, you must

16

first pass on the substantiva question. The detennination of

17

intervention or abstention is a derivative judgement, which

18

is an extraordinary

19

0.

I think that the point Mr. Wirin was. making, one

2©

of his points at least, was simply that the other three plain-

21

tiffs ware not proper appellees. Because at the most all they

22

got was a declaratory judgement and if you'd wanted to appeal

23

that you should have gone to 'the Court of Appeals. And they

24

would have given it to the appellees.there. That’s the way I

understood him. Perhaps I misunderstood.
