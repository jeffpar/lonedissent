ARGUMENT OF JO Ml M. REED, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. REED:

Thank you, Your Honor.
i

11

On. behalf of the Port of Boston Marine Terminal

12

Association and the other petitioners, who are the port ter­

13

minals of the City of Boston, I am going to divided my argument ,

14

into three sections.

15

as briefly as I can with the problem of administrative res

16

judicata, which is the first point raised on the petition for

17

certiorari, and I will conclude with the problem of whether

18

the issue of the tariff in issue here was a modification of

I will state the case, I will then deal

I
13

the conference agreement of my client, the Port of Boston

20

Marine Terminal Association,

21

/.*
This case, if the Court please, began in the summer

22

of 1965., when the Port of Boston Marine Terminal Association

23

and the merdber terminals of the Port of Boston brought a pe-

24

titio» for a declaratory judgment from the Superior Court for

I

j

23

Suffolk County in Massachusetts.

That case was removed by
3

1

the respondents who were the Boston Shipping association and

2

its member* also joined with respondent in the original case,

3

to the federal district court sitting in Boston.

4

And I should point out who those respondents were.
' v

-

5

They were the shipping association itself, an organisation

6

which engages in labor negotiations for the steamships in

7 ! Boston, with the IOWA locals,

the members were the steamship

8

carriers in some cases, in some eases steamship agents, whose

9

function it is in ports to negotiate on behalf of vessels for

50

berth space and ancillary needs of the vessel.
The case was removed on September I, 1965 to the

11
12

federal district court in Boston and in March of the following

13

year the Port of Boston Marine Terminal Association and the

14

other petitioners made a motion for a pretrial order or some-

IS

thing like a summary judgment, which would have given the

16

respondents an opportunity to apply to the Federal Maritime

17

Commission to show the invalidity of the tariff charge being
■

18
19

made.

I
It had already taken place in this case, as X will

20

come to, .that there had been discussions to try to press the

21

Boston Shipping Association and its members into filing a

22

complaint with the FMC, which is the only place where the

23

validity of these tariffs could be adjudged in the opinion of

24

the petitioners.

25

Nothing had been done up until that point, but the
4

1

; federal district judge, hearing this motion in the spring of

2

1986, entered an order that the cases should be stayed until
.
the defendants did have an opportunity to make their complaint

3

j

!

.

4

I

under section 21 of the Shipping Act with the Federal Maritime
I

S

Commission.

6

here»,

And that order appears two places in the record

In one place it is set out in full in rather formal

7

8

language»

9

will appear in the record appendix.

in the other place, ,lt is in the docket entry that

The language of the order

10

may become important in what follows in that the order was not

n

really a reference to the Federal Maritime Commission.

12

order, rather, was one which gave the declaration that the FMC

13

had initial and primary jurisdiction to determine the validity

14

of the charges in question, and that the within proceeding was

'i 5

stayed until the parties involved, namely the defendants, had

The

/

16

made that application.
In other words, it was not like a court referring

17
18

a ease to a master or the FMC referring a case to an examiner.

19

The proceeding which was contemplated would be a collateral

20

proceeding, one not in a court proceeding but one on its own

21

legs.

And in fact that is what actually occurred.

22

On April 21 —

23

Q

Mr. Reed, what is the significance of this?

24

A

The significance of that, if Your Honor please, 5

25

is that we will have argument later, I believe, that the
5

i

district court which referred the matter should have juristic-

2

i tion to review the propriety of what the Federal Maritime Com­

3

mission did, and that has a lot of appeal, if I may say so.

4

court that refers any Kind of a jurisprudential question to

6

7

A

an agency or a master or.anybody else ought to have the power
/
| to determine'whether that person to whom it has made the reference has done it right.
And in this case -- and indeed in all such cases,

8

9

where we talk about reference -- we are really using an illu­

10

sion.

it

place was there was an opportunity to make the application and

12

the proceeding in the FMC was really separate from the proceed-

13

ing in the federal district, court.

14

There really wasn't a reference in this case.

What took

The case went to the Federal Maritime Commission

13

under a complaint that was filed there by all the defendants

16

that were then before the federal district court.

17

all the members of the Boston Shipping Association.

18

that is stipulated and it appears several places in the record.

19

That included
1 think

The Federal Maritime Commission then investigated

20

the matter with a trial examiner and the trial examinder made a

21

ruling on the three issues that had been raised by complaints

22

in the FMC, one each under the sections of the shipping act

23

that are involved, Sections 15,

24
25

;

16, and 17 of the act.

The examiner had made an adverse determination to
the terminals under sections 16 and 17 issues, those are really
6

1

reasonableness issues..

2

decided in favor of the terminals*

3

Under the section 15 issue, the examine*

The terminals appealed to the full board of the

4

commission and obtained a partial reversal.

5

affirmed what the examiner had said about section 15 — that is ;

6

the question as to whether these tariffs had to be approved

7

under section 15 of the shipping act' as modifications — the

8

commission reaffirmed that, but on the reasonable issue under

9

sections 16 and 17,

The commission re­

the commission held first as to certain

10

cargo, namely cargo on which free time had not expired at the

H

outset of the longshoremenfs strike.

12

And as to certain other cargo, namely cargo which was on de­

13

murrage at the outset of;a longshoremen5 s strike, the charges

14

were not valid.

The charges were valid*

16

there as part of stating this case, but X am not going through

17

the procedural aspects, even though I am dividing up a little

18

here.
The commission!a decision ends with an order, and

20

why am I going into this, what difference does it make how the

21

order ends — because my brother is going to say this order

22

isn't a final order, and I say it is a final order.

23

!

I will come back briefly to the factual background

15

IS

:

The commission's order ends with a conclusion that

24

the assessment of strike storage against the vessels for cargo

25

on which free time has expired constitutes an unjust and an
7

I
i

1

unreasonable practice under section 17 of the shipping act and

2

the respondents will be ordered t© amend their strike storage-

S

rule accordingly.

4

the respondents herein — those are my clients — shall amend

S

their terminal tariff number one in a manner not inconsistent

And then the final statement in the order is:

.

6

|

with the commission's decision herein.

7

It is going to be said -« and I pause on this -—

a

that this was not a final order.

9

final order at the time, certainly ordered the terminals to do

io

something and it wasn't just a reaffirmance of everything that

ii

the terminals had been doing up to date.

The parties regard it as a

opponents and their members, applied to the federal district

on June 23f 19S7, applied to the district court in Boston for

18

an amendment of the original order that the court had granted

17

on the question of primary jurisdiction.

And that amendment

.

19

would recognize that all normal rights of appeal from agency

20

decisions — that hadn't been clear in the original order.

21

It was the Boston Shipping Association that asked that to be

22

amended,

■

23

Unfortunately, when the Boston Shipping Association {

24

got to filing its petition for review with its member terminals,;

25

'

it was late, although the case was fully briefed in the
8

I

District of Columbia Court of Appeals, with a record and some

2

of the transcript that will put evidence before the commission,

3

when it got there it was late and the court dismissed the case

4

without determining any'of the merits, and that order of the

5

D. C. Court of Appeals is printed in the record appendis; of

0

our brief on pages 66 and following.
It was about that time that this court decided the

7
8

Volkswagen case.

This court decided the Volkswagen case on

9

March 8 or thereabouts 1958. and the D. C. Court of Appeals

10

was about to throw the Boston Shipping Association out on

11

March 18.

12

Sometime after that, the Swedish Transatlantic

13

Line, whom Mr. Galland represents, on my left, filed a peti­

14

tion with the Federal Maritime Commission for reconsideration

15

on the ground of the Volkswagen case. And that petition, which

16

I filed a reply brief to, was sent back to the counsel for

17

Swedish Transatlantic without action by the commission, as

18

being time'barred.

19
20

The case before the federal district court in Boston
still was pending, and the Swedish Transatlantic Lines, repre*

2!

sen ted by Mr, Galland, then petitioned to intervene in the

22

Boston case.

23

federal district court in Boston and Chief Judge Wysanski

24

allowed that petition for intervention* in which they said on

25

pages 26 and 27 of our record appendix, that at all times

one can understand with the posture of the situation as it
/,
then stood before the federal district court in Boston.
The federal district court heard the parties on a
stipulation of all the facts, including the Federal- Maritime

14

Commission's decision, and made a two-point decision.
First, he said that it would be incumbent on the

16

objector, Transatlantic, to intervene in the FMC proceedings

17

and claim normal rights of appeal if it wanted to get into

18

these issues which were presented; and, second, even if this

19

court were to review it — meaning the federal district court

20

we would reach the same result that the Federal Maritime

21

Commission did, and for reasons that are amply set forth in

22

the commission's decision itself and therefore the district

23

court entered an order of judgment against all the defendants,

24

including Transatlantic *

Transatlantic appealed

to the First Circuit Court of Appeals and won a reversal, and

2

the First Circuit Court of Appeals held first on the res

3

judicata issue, they weren't a party and, as a party,

4

weren't bound by the PMC's decision? and, second, the United

5

States Supreme Court, in the Volkeswagen ease, tools an ex­

G

panded reading of section 15 and under that expanded reading

7

a number of cases ceased to toe authoritative, which are

8

collected in a footnote in the court's opinion on page 15 of

9

the record appendix, and. these charges would become modifica­

10

they

tions of the original section 15 agreement.

n

Now, that was the procedure in the ease and the

ia

factual background is not complex.

13

this:

14

under a terminal conference agreement numbered 8785, and that

15

terminal conference agreement authorizes the members to issue

16

a tariff to fix charges and rates on wharfage demurrage and

17

other terminal services.

m

The factual background is

In the Port of Boston, the terminals have .organised

The exact language of the agreement is printed en­

1'0

tirely in the record appendix.

20

and also the facilities rates and charges incidental thereto,

21

wharfage, dockage, free time, wharf demurrage, usage charges,

22

passenger charges, water and electricity.

?3

The following subject matters

St was under that agreement that the members issued

?4

that tariff initially in 1982, amending it in 1984.

25

amendment of the tariff changed the charge for wharf demurrage
11

The

I

over to the vessel, in cases of longshoremen strides, when as

2

a practical matter the consignee eari't get his cargo off the

3

pier.
That was a practical judgment of the terminals, of

4

S

something that was fair to do, and they ought to do.

6

nothing fco< do with bill collections or anything like that.

7

They were charging people for wharf storage or wharf demurrage

8

oil cargo where the man physically couldn't get his truck in to

9

pick off the cargo, and so they transferred it under the

It has

10

tariff to the vessel where it was a longshoremen's strike.

11

And under the same provision in the tariff, if it is a terminal

12

employees' strike, and longshoremen are not employeed of the

13

terminals, but if it is the terminal employees' strike that

14

prevents removal, then there is no charge to anybody.
That was the practical situation that led up to

15
16

this thorny administrative law question.

The question of the

17

review by the district court of this Federal Maritime Commis­

18

sion decision is one that can be easily answered from examin­

19

ation of the terms of the statutes.

If that is what it says, presumably

12

argument to call ICC procedures into this case, but in a nutell the argument cannot carry.
particular won't support him,

The cases that he cites in

I think they are contradictory

to his argument.
The only one which I am going to mention, before
passing on to the section 15 issue, is Pennsylvania Railroad
vs. United States, in 363.

In that ease,

the.reference so-

called wasfche same Kind of reference we had in this case.

In

that case, the court of claims stayed the proceeding before
it, which was a proceeding by the Pennsylvania Railroad vs.
*

United States, stayed it so the complaining party could go to
the ICC, which the complaining party did.

And under the

statutes governing that particular situation,

the loser before

the ICC would have a right to go to the district court in the
Interstate Commerce Commission situation and this court held
that as a result the court of claims had no review jurisdic­
tion.
It is a holding that is quite parallel to our situ­
ation and quite operable to what my brother will argue.

And,

moreover, the court pointed out there that where the ICC had
reached a divider! determination on the issue,
railroad won on some of the issue,

that is the

and the U.S. as the shipper

won on some of the issue

Where that happened, the order

was not merely advisory,

the order was just as final as it

could be.

And it was in this case.

13

There was nothing more

1

that could be done after these commission proceedings, and for

2

that reason we say it would appear that these issues ought to

3

have been litigated before the commission by Transaltanfcic if

4

it wanted to get in at that time.

S

commission’s proceedings, and there is nothing unfair in

6

holding them to that.

7

j

Xfc was represented in the

But if this court ~~ now, this is the third and

8

last part of my argument -- does decide that there is some­

9

thing unfair in what has taken place or that Transatlantic,

10

in some way that 1 cannot fathom, has missed a day in court

fi

when it was represented by its agent, Furness, Withy, before

12

the commission, if this Court reaches that point, and I rather

13

hope it will because the issue here on the merits is so

14

important, then the argument is resolved, not by looking at

15

the first instance at the VoIkeswagon case, not as far as I

16

as counsel am concerned, because I am arguing to those who

17

wrote the VoIkeswagen case -- you can tell authoritatively

18

what that case means -- but I look first to the statute to see

'39

what it says.

■

20

It says that all agreements, modifications of agree­

21

ments between persons subject to the act, ocean carriers or

22

persons subject to the act, shall be filed with and approved

23

by the commission where they allocate fares or fix rates, et

24

cetera, efc cetera.

25

8785, the original conference agreement, did relate
14

1

to the fixing of rates.

It was filed with the commission.

It

And if the commission finds the rate unreason­

there was no specific statute for review of the decision of

And this Court decided,

not because there was

16

A

That is correct, Mr. Justice, but I would sug­

gest two or three things, if I may, with reference to this

statutory provision.

First of all,

it seems to us that this congressional ;

is a sound argument.

3
4

Q

Yes.

5

A

And let rae make one further point, which 1 think

6

is conclusive on this*

Sven if the court would agree with the

7

respondent on that point, that doesn't help the respondent in
.

8

this case, because when Congress amended and changed the pro­

9

cedures for review of orders of the Interstate Commerce Commis­

10

sion where there had been a reference, it not only provided

ti

that the referring court would have exclusive jurisdiction, but

12

it also provided that any such proceedings review in the refer- ;

date the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission became

final.

'

16

Q

But in the Atlantic Coast Line case, no one

17

said, for example, that the carrier couldn't seek review in

18

some other court if the shipper didn't file his own action.

10

A

That Is correct, Mr. Justice, but I respond

20

that under the Urgent Deficiencies Act, which governs review

21

of Interstate Commerce Commission, holds there is no time

limit for seeking judicial review.

23

provisions, there is no time limit.

that when you are dealing with reparation: orders, you have a
very special situation and Congress has provided -Q

Okay,

I am sorry I interrupted you.

A

Let me, if I may, just come to some of the

chronology of this thing, because it is very clear that there
was no attempt mads to get into the referring court here, the
1

district court, within ninety days after the order of the
Federal Maritime Commssion became final.
However you-define it, fehe decision of the Federal
Maritime Commission in this case was rendered in June 1967,
and Transatlantic's motion to intervene was filed in the
district court in April 1969, so that is almost two years.
27

j

Now let us assume, however, that the decision of the
Maritima Commission did not become final until the court of
appeals had dismissed

as untimely the petition to review that

was filed by the conference.

In that event, it became final

in March of 1968 and again more than a year elapsed before
they went beck into the district court to seek intervention.
Now, let's look at the case from the most favorable
point of view as far as the respondent is concerned.

Let us

assume that the decision of the Maritime Commission did not
become final until the Maritime Commission had. rejected the
petition for reconsideration; and let us further assume that
the final rejection of that petition for reconsideration was
not the letter in October that is contained in the record but
the subsequent letter which we have quoted in our brief which
was sent to us. in December 1968, December 2,

1968? again more

than four months had elapsed, more than 120 days between the
receipt of that letter which under any theory closed the case
and the action of the respondent in seeking to intervene in
the district court.
So that it seems to us under any theory, under any
theory, even assuming that it will be appropriate to rely on
the policy of 1336(b) to say that we will apply the same
i

principles to review an order of the Federal Maritime Commis­
si or/ as we do the orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission
— they still don't come within the terms of that because this
28

I

1

was not filed within 90 days from the date that the order of

2

the Federal Maritime Commission became final.
Q

3

Well, Congress did at one point say that -- as j

4

a matter of fact, it still says that the Maritime Commission

5

orders are to be dealt with, to be reviewed like Interstate

8

Commerce Commission orders, except to the extent that the

7

Administrative Procedure net changes it, is that it?

i

A

8

Well, except to the extent that the Adminis-

tr&tive orders Review Act, and it says the procedure for re-

9

.

IQ

view of Maritime Comission orders is to be the same as that, of

it

the Interstate Commerce Commission orders, but in 1950 review

tz

of Maritime orders transferred from the three-judge district

13

court to the courts of appeals.

14

basically the same, that is the same considerations of finality,

15

parties, et cetera.

16

I assume the procedure is.

Again: I come back to say that Congress — the sole
.

17

problem that was before Congress, when it amended the statute,

18

was the problem of reference to the Interstate Commerce Com­

19

mission.

And it seems to me very difficult, very difficult to

interpret a statute that speaks explicitly of referring a
question to the Interstate Commerce Commission and it speaks
about how you review a pending

order of the Interstate

Commerce Commission, and it says that any proceeding to re­
view to a referring court must be a review of the order of
the Interstate Commerce Commission to interpret that as saying
I

2S

j

?

1 j

that the Congress, Respite this very specific and limited

2 i1

language, must have meant to treat the Maritime- Commission as

<?3

well as covered by this section.

!

i

Sow 1 would like just briefly to refer to two other !

4
S

things in the time I have.

One relates to the question of

8

whether or not Transatlantic should be deemed to be a party
•

7 |

to the commission proceeding.

The court of appeals in refus-

8

ing te "follow the decision of the Maritime Commission in the

9

district court in this case, made a statement that non-parties

j

are not bound.

10

•

How, it would appear that when Transatlantic filed

11
12

its petition for reconsideration with the commission, at least

13

at that point, must have thought itself to have been a party

14

to the prior commission proceedings, because under the com-

15

mission's rule of practice, rule 16(a), which we set forth

16

at page 2.8 of our brief, that provides that only a party may

17

seek reconsideration.

i
!

&nd if Transatlantic was not a party.
'

18

it seems there is no way in which it could seek reconsidera­

19

tion.

£0

In addition —

Perhaps- Mr. Reed can.

1 did not con­

I assume there was a

reason why they — I think what they did is in the case of the
foreign steamship carriers,, they named as parties, not the
carriers but —
Q

But their agents?

A

— their agents, and X think the practice proto'

ably was that charges were such, not against the carriers but
against their agents.
Q

Right.

A

How, what they did say, of course, in seeking

to intervene in the district court, they said that prior to
seeking reconsideration before the commission, they had at all
times been represented by counsel for their agent, Furness,
Hithy.
So as we see this case basically, on this aspect of
it, what we have here is full opportunity and complete litiga­
tion by people who represented the respondent before the
Federal Maritime Commission on a proper reference from the
district court.

In addition to that, these people tried to

follow the statutory procedure for judicial review by filing
a petition for review in the court of appeals for this

i

31

i

circuit? that petition unfortunately was untimely and was

2

pr ©perly dismissed„

3

A very belated effort by Transatlantic to get the

4

Maritime Commission to reconsider this case

5

filed their petition for reconsideration with the Federal

6

Maritime Commission six months after this court had decided

7

the VolKeswageri case.

9

Obviously they could not have filed

11

And certainly it was incumbent upon these people, if they

12

wanted the commission to reconsider its decision in the light

13

of Volkeswagen to move promptly, not to wait for six months.
And therefore it seems to us that this is a case

14

15

in which the question of the validity of the commission’s de­

16

cision as to whether or not this particular agreement was

17

a separate agreement that required prior approval or whether

18

it was within the authority conferred fey the original agree­

19

ment as the Maritime Commission held,, was a matter that was

2©

not open to the district court when it came to consider the

21

complaint following the completion of the Maritime proceedings,

22

and we think in the circumstances, the First Circuit had no

23

warrant in itself overturning that decision,, reviewing the

24

commission’s decision de novo and concluding, as we develop in

list of additional administrative horrors that should not be
I

19

countenanced fey this Court or by any court in the judicial

20

system if there is any rational way to get away from it.

21

i

This case started out with a law suit in Boston*
I

22

first in the State Court* was transferred over to the United

23

States District Court which sought to enforce the ^provisions

24

of something called a tariff which had been filed by a group

23

or terminal warehouses with the Federal Maritime Commission.
36

\

They say it was called a tariff because-, it was

2

truly just a price list that had no sanction except a private

3

agreement among the parties that had been approved at one time

4

in 1962 by the Federal Maritime Commission and which had a pro­

5

vision in it saying that the parties should file with the com­

6

mission the rates that they adopted»
Terminals were not then and are not now covered by

7

8

any statute that either authorises or requires them to file

9

tariffs.

10

Since the events that are before the Court now trans­

pired, a regulation was adopted by the Maritime Commission

1

I
ii

which said terminals should file tariffs but doesn’t command

n

obedience to such tariffs.

13

there was not such a regulation at any relevant time»

There is such a regulation but

u

The agreement that authorised the terminal companies

15

in Boston to adopt port-wide uniform rates, the tariff that was

16

filed -- I mean that agreement, contained a series of defini­

17

tions, one of which was a definition of something called wharf

18

demurrage.

19

that is imposed against the consignees of import cargo when

20

the cargo stays on the pier beyond free time, and free time

21

was defined by these terminals.

22

prescribed this rule.

23

meaning that after the cargo is landed the consignee has that

24

much time to pick it up before somebody makes him pay storage

25

on ,it.

I

•

IV

And it said that ^tfharf demurrage is the charge

They were the only people who

Free time was defined as five days,

And whard demurrage vnas explicitly characterised as a
37

!

charge against cargo,, not merely as a charge against cart© bat

2

as a charge against the consignee of import cargo, and that is

3

exactly what we have here.

4

Consignees don't like to pay charges on cargo when

S

it is tied up on a dock by a strike, nobody does.

s

move the cargo off because the pier is picketed.

7

signees were ?.giving the warehouse — the terminal people

8

trouble in collecting the charge, so the terminal interests

9

said, well,

10

let's try

You can't

Maybe

they will be easier to collect from.

11

So, well the tariff still contained a definition of

12

wharf demurrage as a charge against cargo and against the con­

13

signee of import Cargo.

14

which said contemporaneously with what 1 have just explained,

15

that where the cargo was non-removable because of strike con­

IS

ditions, wharf demurrage would be collected from the ocean

17

carrier.

18

The provision was added to the tariff

Eventually the term "wharf demurrage" in that con­

39

nection was supplemented by a term "strike storage," which

20

initially appeared in the tariff under the heading "wharf de­

21

murrage" when that inconsistency was proceeded, it was moved

22

to some place in the back of the tariff, but the terminal in­

23

terests were so confused about what they were doing that they

24

even defined strike storage as a charge against cargo and

25

against the consignees of import cargo, not as a charge against
38

3

the vessel.

2

the entire time.

3

'5
6
7

So they had inconsistent definitions in the tariff

How, a good question here is what ware they entitled
to do under Agreement 8785, under which the terminal organisa­
tion created itself and which was approved by the Maritime
Commission.
What the agreement said was on the subject of its

8

coverage was said in four lines in paragraph three of the agree­

9

ment, and it said that the terminals could impose — it could

10

adopt and impose uniform charges for standard services.

ft

were listed specifically.

tz

vant here was wharf demurrage.

13

only about to be defined within a few days in..-the tariff,, which

14

was to be filed under this agreement, but it had been the sub­

15

ject of half a dozen or a dozen cases before the Maritime

16

Commission, which we cite, under which the commission had al­

17

ways held that demurrage — that wharf demurrage was a charge

18

against cargo.

10

ment of particular charges for particular terminal services,

20

and they always come out with the settled and unbroken line of

21

decision that these charges were charges against cargo.

22

They

The only one of them that was rele­
And wharf demurrage was not

It had case after case to determine the assign­

Consequently, it is our position that when the

23

Maritime Commission approved an agrecanent which authorised

24

terminal operators to make collective charges for wharf demur­

25

rage, they were authorizing charges which were recognised by
33

I

industry, recognised by the commission, recognised by everybody

2

as subsequently proved toy the definitions in this tariff as to

3

toe charges against cargo remaining on the dock after the

4

period of free time»

5

The question as to what the agreement meant is of
S

6

foremost importance in this case because whatever it meant

7

originally was wharf demurrage was imposed as a charge against

0

cargo, it suddenly became to mean something the exact opposite j

9

when wharf demurrage ms assessed against the vessel.

*

In other words, there was an explicit change in the

10

n

incidence of this explicit charge.

'12

as you could possibly get.

13

It was as radical a change

The participation of the Swedish Transatlantic Line

14

in this case came about in stages,

Swedish corporation operating Swedish flag vessels, and it is

16

based in Gothernberg, Sweden andc like many foreign steamship

11

seek a ruling from the Maritime Commission on the lawfulness

12

and reasonableness of the contested demurrage charges.

13

Promptly, upon receiving a communication from

14

Swedish Transatlantic, which was in something of a quandary as

15

to what was going on in Boston and where it stood and what its

16

relations of the case might have been; I took measures to call

17

to the attention of the Maritime Commission that the switch in

18

the incidence of these tariff charges for wharf demurrage

19

appeared to be in conflict with this Courtis decision in the

20

Volkeswagen ease.

21

this Court’s decision in the Volkesvagen case.

22

The Maritime Commission, decision preceded

My reference to the VoIkeswagen ease in the petition

23

to the Maritime Commission for reconsideration came after

24

some delay following the Volkeswagen case.

25

upon the inception of my relationship with Swedish Transatlantic.
41

It came immediately

1

Wow, whether, Mr. Justice Harlan, whether Swedish

2

Transatlantic was a party to the Boston proceedings in these

3

circumstances under the Maritime proceedings is conceivably

4

arguable, but Judge Aldrich in Boston held distinctly, as I

5

read his opinion, that it was not in any event — whether it

S

was a party or not a party, it was not a party in any sense

7

that was meaningful as regards the protections of its own in­

8

terests because Judge wysanski admitted Transatlantic to

9

intervention in his case on a representation that Transatlantic

10
11

was inadequately represented by Furness, Withy & Company.
One reason it was inadequately represented was the

12

judgment against Furness, Withy wasn't going to cost Furness,

13

Withy anything as far as Transatlantic was concerned, because

14

it was going to claim indemnification.

15

Q

Well, if you are in privity, apart from whether

16

you are a party or not, you would still be stuck with this

17

judgment, would you?

18

A

Stuck with the District Court's judgment, by

19

which I don't concede that we didn't have a right fc© appeal

20

from it or that —

21
22
23
24
25

Q

B?o, I meant the Maritime Commission judgment,

A

If we were in a relationship which this Court

if you were

holds to be —
Q

What do you say to that?
42

i

A

1

I say that we are not, because the Furness,

2

Withy

3

against them, as agent, was not going to cost them a thing.

4

There was another factor, that Furness, Withy had caved in and

5

already paid some of the charges when Swedish Transatlantic

6

came along and said it was going to look pretty silly to some

7

of its other principals if Transatlantic upset the applecart.

&:

The judgment

Furness, Withy's lawyer filed an appeal weight from

8
8

Company had no incentive to resist.

the Maritime Commission for the District of Columbia Court of

10

Appeals.

1!

an incentive to do a good job, an adequate job of representa­

12

tion, and it didn^fc in fact do a good job of representation

13

and that is why Judge WysansJti admitted Swedish Transatlantic

14

IS

n

So our position was that Furness, Withy didn't have

the case before him.
It seems to me that when he admits Swedish Trans­

16

atlantic because its interests weren’t otherwise adequately

17

protected, it makes no sense at all to say that Swedish Trans­

18

atlantic had its day in court before the Maritime Commission.

19

Mow, getting bEiCfc to the consequences of a ruling

20

of the District Court and the evil that fell from it, I would

21

like to cite the fallowing circumstances:

22

Such a ruling will mean that the Maritime Commission's

23

decision, which we claim to be at odds with the Voliceswagen

24

case, would become the governing decision controlling a subse­

25

quent judgment of the United States District Court, in the
43

1

event of reversal of the United States Court of Appeals, even

z

though this Court had subsequently to the Maritime Commission's

aTJ

decision decided the Volkeswagen case to the effect that the

4

Maritime Commissiones decision was wrong.

5

Now, I see no reason in the world why a Maritime
i

6

Commission decision that is corrected should be permitted to

7

stand in Conflict with the subsequent decision of this Court.

8

And the conflict involves not a quibble and not a detail but a j

9

matter of high administrative policy.

It has to do with the

10

administration of section 15 of the shipping act, which is

U

the rule gut of that act as a regulatory mechanism.

12

Regulation under the shipping act is different from
j

13

regulation under the Interstate Commerce Act, because the

14

shipping act deals with foreign commerce and the government of

'55

the United States has hold of only one end of the transaction,

16

Every bit of FMC regulation of foreign shipping has diplomatic

57

overtones,and the commission can't do a great deal toy way of

j

i
;

18

direct regulation.

19

way of governmental policing of the system of self-regulation

20

carried out by the shipping conferences.

21

And it is

And therefore what it does do is done by

I

most rates in ocean trade are confer­

22

ence made, conference controlled, on the basis of tariffs

23

filed under approved agreements.

24

how these agreements are made and what the procedure is for

25

their approval or their disapproval.

It is important to understand I

I
44

The agreements are

j

1

negotiated in conversation among the lines that will adopt the

2

uniform rate schedule under them, and they are then filed with

3

the commission.

"

In the old days the commission used to post them on j

5

a. bulletin board in a dark corridor and if nobody objected

6

within twenty minutes they would get out their little round

7

rubber stamp and put "approval” on it.

8

That system was condemned by Judge Frank in one of the early

9

Xsbrandtsen cases, in 96 Fed Supp.

.j

n

commission didn't even own a little round rubber stamp that

12

said "disapproved."
Now when an agreement is filed, if is noticed under

internal procedures of the internal administrative orders of

«5

the commission.

16

announcement of the agreement appears in the Federal Register.

17

The Register is read by people who are interested in commission

18

proceedings, and anybody who sees an agreement which appears

10

to affect his interest is then at liberty to file a protest

20

or a comment and to demand a hearing if be is so advised.

It is filed with the Federal Register and an

Now, the importance of: the Volkeswagen decision and

22

all decisions like it, having to do with changes in the inci­

23

dence of charges under such agreements, is that when an agree­

24

ment is announced to the public, only the people upon whom

25

that agreement has a recognizable incidence has any motivation

one of the attorneys brought out on cross-examination that the

to oppose the agreement or to appear in proceedings concerning

2

its approval for the purpose of protecting their interests.

3

If we may read a summary of the agreement in the

4

Federal Register., they find that it affects only their

5

antagonists in. the business transaction, they stay away and

e

the agreement is approved.

7

the Federal Register, announcing that the terminals were seek­

8

ing the right to make uniform rates relative to whard demurrage,

9

no ocean carrier had any incentive to appear to object to that

When Agreement 8785 was noticed in

?0

agreement because by long and settled -- a long and settled

!1

series of determinations of the commission, wharf demurrage

12

was payable not by the carrier interests but by the cargo in­

13

terests.

14

The agreement was approved without participation by

15

the carrier interests, and after a period of imposing wharf

16

demurrage on the cargo and not being able to collect it, then

17

the parties to the agreement say let5s try and get it from

18

the carriers instead of the cargo, so an overall tariff switch,

19

and without seeking any amendment to the agreement that the

20

carriers would have any opportunity to oppose, they make this

21

a charge against the carriers.

22

The government says that the agreement was approved

23

and the only thing that wasnft fixed is the question of who

24

pays the charge.

25

the question of who pays the charge is usually the difference

And I have a footnote in our brief saying

46

|

?

between judgment for the plaintiff and judgment for the defend­

2

ant and it is more than the trivial item in most law suits.

3

In any ©vent., there is simply no limit on the

4

possibilities for economic predation if a croup of price-fixers

5

is permitted to organise itself and advertise that it plans to

6

fix prices to be paid by one group, if after it gets approval

7

for such an agreement it can without any control whatever

8

swifch the incidence of. its price-fixing arrangements to a dif­

9

ferent group.

It seems to me that the entire mechanism of

10

control under the shipping act is destroyed if that type of

11

administration of the shipping act is countenanced.

12

sequently I say that in terms of the precept of the Southern

13

Steamship case, this Court should do everything possible to

14

see that that Kind of administration is not tolerated.

15

And con­

An additional black mark against the Maritime Com­

16

mission in this ease is that in writing a 16-page opinion

17

construing the agreement of this terminal association,

18

never quoted the four lines of language which were the only

19

four lines that are relevant to its decision.

20

them and it distorted them in the paraphrase.

21

i.t

It paraphrased

Another very basic feature of the Maritime Coramis-

22

sionJs regulatory program under the shipping act is the in-

23

tegrity of the tariff system.

24

shipping aetj

25

under all transportation and public utility statutes ©f

For quite a long time under the

tariffs were not required as they are required

47

1

domestic utilities and carriers.

2

it used to be that the carriers in foreign commerce had to

3

file their tariffs thirty days after they became effective,

4

merely as a matter of information.

5

ment that any carrier had to adhere to a tariff rate because

6

he could always change it and file the change within thirty

7

days.

By administrative regulation

But there was no require­

In 1961 Congress changed that with amendments to

8
9

the shipping act, which added tariff filing requirements,

10

more to those in the Interstate Commerce Act, the Federal

11

Aviation Act and the Federal Communications Act and all the

12

others.

13

some

So that there is now a provision that a tariff of a

14

common carrier in foreign commerce must (a) be filed in a

15

public place, and (b) must be observed so that the tariff rates

16

become the lawful rates for ocean carriers in foreign commerce

17

as they are for railroad companies or an airline.

18

And the tariff that was filed by Swedish Trans­

19

atlantic Line said in two places — one, in the rules of the

20

tariff itself, and the other was in the bill of lading filed

21

as a part of the tariff pursuant to law — that the obligatiora

22

of Swedish Transatlantic Line began when it piclced the cargo

23

up at ship®8 tackle and ended when it put it down.

24

2S

And the commission's decision totally ignores that
tariff in favor of a tariff which is totally non-official,
48

1

filed by the terminal operators in this case so that the force

2

of law is attached to the terminal tariff, which is filed only

o

pursuant to a private agreement and is nowhere sanctioned by

4

statute, and was not even sanctioned by a commission regulation

5

at the time, and if disregards the legally mandatory tariff of

6

the ocean carrier.

7

of control under section 15 of the shipping act is to throw

8

away every wholesome and useful aspect of the regulatory pro­

9

gram administered by the Federal Maritime Commission,

V

-1 ■

To do that, in conjunction with the erosion

ted I

10

suggest that if there is any way out, this Court should cer­

11

tainly not enshrine as the law of this case and for future

12

cases the decision of the Federal Maritime Commission and' of

13

the District Court in Boston which blindly adopted the decision

14

of the Maritime Commission if there is any good way to

15

rationalise a contrary decision.
I have submitted in our brief -- and Mr. Justice

16
17

White has suggested some of the arguments for such rationalisa­

tion.

20

Black6s decision in U.S. vs. ICC, and on through the Consolo

21

case and the Atlantic Coast Line case, written by Mr. Justice

22

White, that the Court has recognised the statutes in this area

23

as such a hodge-podge that some sense has to be breathed into

24

them judicially.

25

It has been true in at least three major recent eases,

But it is not hard to breath rationalisation into

ARGUMENT OF JOHN M. REED, ESQ.,

5

OH BEHALF OF PETITIONERS — REBUTTAL

6

MR. REED:

If Your Honor please, the question arose

7

as to the reason for not joining Transatlantic in the District

8

Court and the Superior Court proceedings.

9

court suggested that it was that they are not subject to the

10

jurisdiction of the court agents under the tariff are liable

11

for tariff charges.

Someone In the

12

I
!
I counted up in the petition five of the respondentsj

13

were carriers and the other eight respondents were agents, and 1

14

all the cases against agents, all the bills against agents

IS

were bills where the carrier would be liable over and, indeed,

16

as Mr. Galland says, that was the reason that Transatlantic

17

came into this ease.

18

j

The only other point I want to (rake is that the
unbroken line of decisions about wharf demurrage that Mr.

j

20

Galland refers to, where the commission has steadily held de~

j

21

murrage is a charge against cargo interests, is a non-existent

\

22

line of authority as far ss I can tell, and on page 46 of our

23

brief we cite a commission decision that is quite recent,

24

dealing with wharf demurrage where the vessel has cancelled

25

or been delayed, and so that the charge isnft fairly

19
