The surveillance spanned a course

On August 24/, 1963/, Mro Angelin! and his confederates

5

were arrested at the race track pursuant to an arrest warranto

6

A search of his person subsequently revealed that ha was in

7

possession of $8„674 in currency®

8

In 1364,, Mr® Angel ini was criminally convicted of

9

wilful failure to register under Sec® 4412 of Title 26 and

10

to pay the annual $50 occupational tax under Sec„ 4411®

It

was sentenced to 60 days in prison,, fined $2 500 and placed on

22

The libel alleged

Claimant Angelini intervened asserting the property

23

belonged to him®

24

and in June—-in June of °65ff approximately 12 Federal agents

25

testified to their observations of the 1963 bookmaking operatior s

A trial was thereafter held by the court,

4
i

i

at the race track, and there was also evidence that the Re­

2

spondent money was used in the business as ready cash to pay

3

off bettors®
And it was also stipulated at this trial that although

4
5

Claimant Angel ini had registered and paid the occupational tax

6

in 1957 and 1958» he had not done so for the period covering

The District Court found in its findings 33 set forth
at pages 9 and 10 of the Appendix-—there was no jury trial,,

11

making business had been conducted at the? race track from

12

August 1 to August 24» 1963 without payment of the required

13

taxes» that the Respondent money quoted integral part of this

14

operation and therefore it was forfeited to the United States»,

The court of Appeals thereafter affirmed on the basis

16

of Kahriger and Lewis and Claimant filed a Petition for Cer­

17

this Court decided Marchetti-Grosso and some five weeks after

Q

While I have you interrupted* do 1 correctly

7

assume that the Seventh Circuit assumed in this case* took it

8

for granted* the retroactivity of Marchetti-Grosso?

©

A

1 would assume that the Second Ci—the Seventh

1

Circuit assumed in this case that Marchetti-Grosso was re­

11

troactive to the extent that applied to all cases within its

12

reach pending on appeal when Marchetti-Grosso was decided*

13

Q

And is it cn that comment that you just made

14

that one may resolve any seeming inconsistency with the

15

Seventh Circuit"s decision in Mackey?

16

inconsistent«

17

A

Maybe they are not

Well* Mackey involved a non-gambling offense

18

which is one basic distinction*

19

collateral attack involved a final conviction*

2

basic thing hare was that the Seventh Circuit assumed that

21

Marchetti-Grosso applied to all cases pending on appeal by

22

virtue of Stone* and that this ease was simply a Marchetti-

23

Grosso case*

24
25

It is on habeas on 2255 in
I think the

And it is our position that the Seventh Circuit erred
in that conclusion* that neither the letter nor the spirit of
7

1

the Fifth Amendment privilege nor its application in Marchetti-

Grossc support the determination of the Seventh Circuit in

this case»

4

Q

Just one last question—

5

A

¥gs0 sir.,

6

Q

-—and 1 will stop interrupting you„

I take it

7

you sense no—-no inconsistency between the Seventh Circuit es

8

decision in this case and in Mackey?

9

A

Well,—

10

Q

They are different panels except for one judge0

11

A

-—that is rights

They tend to distinguish»

I

12

think there have been—-have been inconsistencies primarily and

13

difficulties in courts of appeals in applying the principles

14

of Marchetti~Grosso in these myriad of situations because

15

it is not being clear, the* issue of retroactivity has not been

16

focused on by this Court in Marchetti and Grosso at all»

17

assumption has been &y virtu® of Grosso and by virtue of Stone

18

that all cases pending on appeal, criminal cases involving

19

Marchetti-Groaso violations, is subject to its turn»

20

that Mackey can b® distinguished from this ease in terms of—

21

the fact that it is an income tax case and that it is on-coll-

22

aferal tax, it is ;rjot within the prenumber of the wagering

23

tax scheme, and—but, I would like to focus» if I may, on this

24

particular case which, as I say, our starting point is Marchetti

25

and Grosso, to determine what it did and what it did not hold

e

The

We think

1
2

for the purposes of this case»
In Marchetfci-Gross© this Court determined that if a

3

gambler failed to register and pay the occupational tax he

4

was subject to criminal prosecution®

S

did register he faced the real danger in the information that

6

he had provided, would subject him to prosecution under a network

7

of Federal

8
9

On the other hand*, if he

or.State provisions making gambling a crime®

Marchetti and Grosso,, as we read the opinion* freed
the gambler from this dilemma by holding that the comprehensive

10

scheme could not be employed "to punish criminally a gambler

11

Who defends a failure to apply with the assertion of the

12

privilege against self-incrimination®"

13
14

q

May I ask you. if the Government has filed any

Brief any later than the Brief of January 2,; 196'*--

15

A

In this case?

16

Q

Yes o

17

h

Eo„ it has not* Your Honor®

18

We have filed following this case,, there are questions

19

of retroactivity different in context than the problem focused

20

upon here£. which will follow the next three cases which the

21

Government has developed in soma detail its general positions

22

on the retroactivity question in different context®

23

of course,, does involve a conviction allegedly in violation

24

Marchetci-Grosso and that was filed last time®

25

cases involve a full development in the Fourth Amendment context
9

Mackey*
of

The next two

1

on the retroactivity issue«

2

has been filed.»

But in this casa,- no further Brief

It seems to us that in Marchefcti and Grosso the Court

3
4

repeatedly made clear that the wagering tax scheme was being

R

left intactp that neither the occupational or excise tax

6

provisions were invalid or that civil Usability was in any way

7

being extinguished.

«jO

That in ®hort9 as the Court

8

pointed out in Mr» Jus­

9

tice Harlan as ©pinion,» its holding was not meant to prevent

10

either the taxation or regulation by Congress of activities

11

otherwise made unlawful by Federal or State laws or statutes.»

12

The erosion of the privilege in that setting thus

13

was that the compulsion was directed at an individual who„

14

if he failed to succum had to pay the price of criminal

15

punishment o
As Mrc Justice Brennan put it in his concurrent opin­

16
17

ion in Grosso., that scheme was designed primarily for an utili­

10

sed appeal—and any of its citizens engaged in criminal activ­

19

ities»

20

We think that the root falacy of the decision of the

21

Seventh Circuit is its equation of statutory forfeiture

22

with the criminal punishment dealt with in Marchefcti-Grosso»

23

It misapprehends the continued existence of the wagering tax

?A

scheme and in our judgment overlooks wholly the fact that

as

the statutory forfeiture from the time of Blackstone and
before war. recognized as a remedial revealed measure to en-

10

1

2

fore® its tax still entirely valid*
I mean it is quit© important on this aspect of cry

3

argument to emphasise® that this distinction between criminal or

4

common law forfeiture and statutory forfeiture,»

5

In criminal forfeiture it is necessary to prove the

s

guilt ©£ the owner*, in order to forfeit property* whether or not

?

the owner himself is convicted.

3

guilt or iimocense of the tamer of the property is irrelevant.

9

It is the illegal use or intent t© us—or intention to use the

10
11

In statutory forfeiture the

property in violation of law which is the material consideration.
These cases are set out in our Brief, Goldsmith-Grant*

M

the most perhaps the best illustration was during the period of

prohibition.

One provision ©f the Prohibition Act* Section 26«

7

provided for a criminal prosecution and the traditional theory

8

of criminal* a common law forfeiture,, that upon such conviction

9

the property used would be forfeited®

10

And there' is another provision which was in the revised

1!

statutes and which was the predecessor of the instant provision,,

12

which didn't focue upon the owner or the individu—owner»

And the question arcs© as to whether they were incon­

15

sistent a® to whether you had to use one or the other provision®

16

And this Court made it clear in One Ford Coupe* which is 272

17

Halted States* that these provisions were not inconsistent*

18

that if the Government used the lateri»! Revenue provisions

19

rather than the precise criminal forfeiture—the criminal

20

prevision which entails forfeiture—that the, ianocease ©r guilt

21

of the owner was wholly irrelevant»

22

be the very essence of Boyd* upon which Claimant will ride and

23

upon which the Cotart of Appeals rested its decision»

24

in Boyd what the Court was dealing with was this criminal

25

forfeiture provision®

And this seer© to me t©

Namely,,

So that we* of course* do not request

13

Qur

t

this Court to retreat one* inch from Boyd in this case*

2

position ia„ as Mr.. Justice Brandies made clear in Helvering

3

against Mitchell,, that Boyd is not applicable here and Boyd

4

itself recognised*
Indeed,- the quote in Supplemental Brief filed by

5
6

the Claimant at page 11# in the—stemming from Boyde makes it

7

quite clear that they were talking about punishment of the

8

individual*

9

essence of statutory forfeituree the kind that is here involved

That was the essence of criminal forfeiture,, the

10

is to have used property which has been used in violation ©f

11

law*

12

so used again*

13

ly a remedial function*

The basic purpose ©f that is that the property cannot be
It is a remedial—-traditionally and historical­

If there is any privilege in these circumstances it

14
15

is that of the property^ not that-**those who have put the

16

property to illegal use*
For example„ relevant ter®, 1 think# is this Court®£

17
18

decision in the Campbell Painting Corporation at 392 U* S.

19

where the president.of the corporation could not complain

20

because he suffered economic loss of self-compulsion because

21

of his refusal under a claim ©f privilege to testify before a

22

grand jury which resulted in termination of his corporation0©

23

25

His privilege did not enter into the matter at alio
So here# neither does the privilege ©f Mr* Angelin! ©r anyone

1

else who engage in the gambling business»

2

has already been afforded,, no gambler,, if 2 understand the

3

decision of this Court; can be prosecuted criminally for failing

4

to file the requisite form®

As this Court points out in Xhox„

5

the converse would be true®

If one filed under the compulsion

6

©f the statutory scheme„ which led to conviction for a gambling

7

offense,,-—led t© prosecution for a gambling ©ffense-«as Mr®

3

Astice Harlan pointed out in Khox0 then the claim ©f privilege

9

would fee available®

10

And that was the

That protection

This would be the other side of the coin®

previous

case which this Court referred to
/

11

in the Knox appearances *
It is our alternative position lit this respect that

12
13

even if the privilege of forfeiture should be deemed a penalty

14

if is not every degree of compulsion or every type ©f penalty

13

which felt© privilege bars®

13

the closest analogy 2 have noted is the Campbell Painting

17

Corporation case,, and also Gardner and Broderick uniform sani-

18

tation

19

Her® the penalty is attenuated and

which was cited in our brief®
Xft those casese it was recognised that public employes

20

could be discharged from public employment for failure to

21

provide information to the State relating directly and narrowly

22

t© the performance of their official duties so long as the dis­

23

charge was not bastd upon the invocation of privilege and where

24

the Invocation could act be used ©gainst any later criminal

25

prosecution®

15

1

Here it seems to us whatever penalty* and this is our

2

alternative argument,, that even assuming that I am wrong* that

3

these ay© not penalties, whatever penalties my be said to

4

have attached to fch© gambler are even more remote in collateral»

5

He had the protection of the privilege from criminal prosecu­

8

tion and it seems to us it would be straining Grosso and May-

7

chetti quite clearly beyond their holdings if, in addition, he

8

may retain property which may or say not be his*

9

For example, in Buick Sedan, this Court—District

10

Court, concluded that $300,000 there seized could not belong

11

to the Claimants»

12

the claim of Claimant that the $8,000 fees belong to him»

13

District Court made no such finding at all»

14

And there is nothing to indicate her® except

position»

18

The privilege, we think not, should be conveyed to

If the Court is of the view that th® principles, how­

19

ever, of Marchetti and Grosso aye applicable in this civil

20

context, then a question ©f retroactivity emarges,.

21

takes on perhaps several forms»

22

This

First, it seems to us it would have to be decided

23

that Marchetti and Grosso itself, the straight Harchetti-Grosao

24

situation, was fully retroactive»

25

ease would fall within those principles,,

16

And then, if so, whether this

1

Our basic position ia that Marchetti and Grosso is

2

not retroactive in the criminal context under the gambling

3

statutes where relief on its terms is sought on post-conviction

4

review under the three-prong standard of privilege, reliance,,

5

and effect upon the ad min 1stration of justice»

0

We would certainly argue that while this case tech­

7

nically is on direct review* that it is also collateral in the

3

sense that we are not here dealing with criminal convictions;

9

we are dealing with the issue of alleged interest in property

ARGUMENT OF MISS AS3NA R., LAV IN g ESQ „ e

QE BEHALF OF C LA XI^OT-RES POM3EHT

7

MISS LAV 113:

if it please the Court,,. I doubt very-™

8

aside from the statement I don31 know that it has any real

9

significance,, but I think we may as well dispose of it* so we

10

will at least recognise that there is no Fourth Amendment

11

question in this case.

12

Counsel stated that a search wag made of Mr» Angelin!®s

13

person at the time of his arrest»

14

some $£600 on his person»

15

the time he went through the ordinary processing at the United

16

States ^irs!ial°s office on a request to empty his pockets»

17

persons taken into custody are»

It developed that there was

Actually the money

was revealed at

All

The money was not seized at

As I say„ I dsn°fc think it is a matter of great con*
sequence one way or another»
Mr» Justice Blackman asked about cases remanded at

22

the same feirse aa was this ease and I point out that not one t©

23

say knowledge * in not oim has the Government' requested a Certior­

24

ati where the—we got a criminal matter involved»

25

They* however* made a distinction in this case because
20

!

it concerns forfeiture®

2

1 think that there is no distinction between a criminal

S

conviction and a forfeiture proceedingI think that Marchefcti

4

and, Grosso apply equally

S

to both.

The announced object of this Court in deciding Mar-

6

c'hetti and Grosso was the protest—or, rather, the protection

7

of the individual against self-incrimination under the compre­

8

hensive system of Federal and State prohibitions against wagering

8

activities *

10

In Malloy versus Hogan, this Court said in part that

n

the Fifth Amendment secures the right to a person to remain

12

silent unless he wishes to speak in the unfettered exercise of
...

13
14

\

'

' "

his own will and fee suffer no penalties0
In Spevack versus Klein again, this Court emphasised

15

that penalties used in the context with fcha Malloy case is

16

not restricted to fine or imprisonment, that it means any

i/

sanction that makes assertion of the privilege is, in the word©

18

of this Court, is costly.

19

And we have with Spevack, disbarment £ Garrity lost

20

ai® job? the young lady who lost her position as a teacher whose

21

naras- x cion°fc now remember0

22

So 2 suggest to the Court, if Marchetfci and Grosso

23

has retroactive effect, a question that has not

24

to my knowledge, been brought up as far as criminality is

2S

concerned, then it has retroactive effect so far as forfeiture
21

1 right now

1
2

proceedings are concerned..
1 would like to address myself just in passing to

3

the Mackey case because that was also a product of questioning

4

by the Court»

5

between Mackey and the earlier case of La Critisc which was

6

remanded by this Courtc a criminal gambling prosecution under

7

1952«' the distinction is made was that Mackey did not involve

8

gambling offenses0 it being an income tax Evasion case»

The Seventh Circuit stated there is distinction

\

3

Later the Second Circuit.—X mean the Seventh Circuit—

10

in even a more recent case decided September 9« I®?©,, Desil (?)

11

v.» 0«, £,« in reversing Desil said we distinguish this from

12

Mackey because Mackey did not come within the object of the

13

Supreme Court when they said they wanted to protect the privi­

14

lege against self-incrimination where local and state gambling

15

statutes were concerned*

16

17
18

Thusthe distinction the Seventh Circuit makes, and
X submit to this Court that it is a valid one»
Slow* counsel here has indicated that this Court has

19

recognised under certain instances Boyd is not a deterrent

20

t© thec well,, to interpretation of constitutional rightsD

21

might say that when any—whenever this Court has spoken it has

22

spoken in regard to Sixth Amendment rights and has expressly

23

emitted from considerat ion any Fifth Amend sent rights which

24

they—which it has always considered evasive <>

A© a matter of fact#

The only act of the Claimant here which has intended

2

to have made his property subject to this forfeiture is his

refusal to waive his Fifth Amendment rights»

is removed from the case as constitutionally unimportant„ there

5

is no basis for a finding of guilt»

Well,; that has, nothing to ao with Marchefcfei-

A

i don ’t think that has anything to do with the

14

basis for Marchetti-and-Gross© or how it affects this case»

15

notwithstanding whatever t consider

16

a long-time authority and in some occasions the proof»

17

We must remember that, there is no Federal violation

18

in carrying $8674»

the only act of censure to that guilt-finding process is first

How this Court in Marchetfci versus Grosso makes it

clear that those two statutes are interdependent* because as it

All right»
25

1

The thing I am trying to point out,, and I hope 1 have

2

clone it» is the only act that, would make this forfeiture valid

3

under Federal law is proof of the failure to comply with 4411

4

and 4412o

S

The only basis upon which guilt could be found is the

3

refusal t© waive constitutional rights under the Fifth Attend-

7

mant«

8

So actually» if 1 suggest to the Court* this new

9

constitutional so-called rule goes to the guilt-finding process»

10

And the three considerations for which the Government--on which

11

the Government suggests that you waive retroactivity in pro­

12

spective application» do not actually coma into play here be­

13

cause this is beyond the consideration» the entertainment of

14

those cons icier a tions«

13

But* if this Court disagrees and—I submit I don9fc

18

see that it can because it is obvious that the only thing that

17

will prove a forfeiture is the failure to waive the Fifth

13

Amendment right»

19

If you do not agree with ®ee let us go then to the

20

purpose to be served by this new rule»

21

fe© be learned fro® Marchefcfci and Gross© is that you may not

22

compel a parson fcc pay a tax and file a return in the manner

23

required by 4411 and 4412 tmless we give him full immunity»

24
23

A big change—lesson

The nexf question urged by the Government is:

Would

that immunity require immunity just from criminal prosecution
2§

1

or also from civil forfeiture* a pure penalty here?

2

relation to any $50 excise tax*.

3

Without

It seems that the Government Js interpretation of the

4

so-called new rule,, that a congressional grant of pervasive

5

criminal immunity did not extend to these penalty forfeitures«

6

We {submit,, and we have submitted* on the basis of the

7

many immunity Acts passed by the congress* that the Congress

8

recognises the to give full immunity you must not only give

9

immunity from criminal statutes but also the immunity roust

10
11

extend to forfeitures0
Without unduly burdening this Court* I would refer

12

Your Honors to the Digest and the wording of the immunity grants

13

that we have set cut at pages 6 and 7 of our original Brief*

14

27

1

I say that diligent effort has been extended to this

2

point and we found none that excepted forfeiture from the

first step of the immunity»,

Nov? the second consideration that has been developed

isn't clear to us just how the Government thinks that there

is going to be an effect on the administration of justice»

A

11

rather impressive figure was offered this afternoon of some

12

$2-1/2 million involved here»

13

were suggested in the Government's Brief about some $7 million

14

in money and property having been appropriated»

Even more impressive figures

15

How 1 suggest that? should it be necessary for the

16

Government to give back any of this money or property,, that

17

the simple expedience of writing a check is the answer to it

18

and there will be no interference with the administration of

19

justice»

2©

In the meantime,, I would submit that the Government

21

has been recompensed to the extent of probably 8© >jto 90 -

22

percent of the money and property it appropriated®

23

Counsel has indicated in his Argument that this is

24

purely a remedial statute„ the statute calling for forfeiture»

25

When this case was argued the first time* that argument was also
29

i

made with a special reliance being made on Helvering versus

2

Mitchell»

3

ure applying the rationale of the Helvering case did not

4

constitute a penalty*

3

addition to the criminal sanctions but rather compensated the

6

Government for its actual loss*

7

The essence of that argument was that this forfeit­

It did not constitute a penalty in

This Court knows that Helvering was a tax assessment

8

ease and concerned a 50 per cent fraud penalty* There there

9

was a direct relationship to the outstanding tax; here no out­

10

standing tax exists*

II

ically although it is indicated in the Brief that Mr* Angelini

12

has been assessed for the $50 occupational tax* he has been

13

assessed for the amount that the Government assumes he made

14

over .10 per cent under 4401*

no relationship in this forfeiture to the assessment that the

Government intended on account of these activities*
