MR. ESKRIDGE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This is an important case because it poses
the famous athlete, the Ex-Heavyweight Champion of the World
against the United States Selective Service System,, which
treated him, we say, unfairly.
May it be recalled that in February 1964, the
so-called "Louisville Lip," so called because of his loqua­
ciousness, to say the least, he

had just won the champion­

ship and had made great public acclaim.

He had just announced

at that time that he was a so-called "Black Muslim."

At that

time they were considered to be terrorists or subversives be­
cause the Justice Department at that time was then wiretapping
his leader, the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.
Well, soon after he won the championship in
March of 1964 it was announced by the officials of the Selec­
tive Service System that he had been given
2

two qualifications

1

tests and he had failed both and had been given a classifica­

2

tion of “1-Y."

3

ofnewspaper copy he v?as then sent on 3 February of '66 a

4

statement of his acceptability because the Selective Service

5

System had lowered its qualifications for admission to the

6

Armed Forces*

7

Q

What is the classification 1-Y?

8

A

1-Y means that he

9
10

Almost two years went by and after many years

would only be taken in

case of war in a national emergency.
On 14 February 966 he wrote a letter to his local

11

draft board, alleging the fact which he claims entitled him

12

under the law to several lower classifications? including that

13

of conscientious objector.

14

his local board reclassified him.

15

board sent him the usual form 150 which is the application for

16

a conscientious objector.

17

Without more, on 17 February 1966
Then the next day the local

Then, on the 28th of February he sent the applica­

18

tion back and which, showing on the face of the application

19

what we consider to be a prima facie entitlement to the status

20

of conscientious objector.

21

"Muslim means 'PeaceB, total submission to the will of the law?

22

do not take the lives of anyone, nor war when not ordered by a

23

law,"and in parentheses he has the word '{(Sod) ^ "keep our

24

prayers and pay poor rates?" a quotation from his Form 150.

25

And Form 150 may be found on page 17-A of the appendix.

In his handwriting he wrote?

3

1

X8m sorry? on page 12-A of the appendix.
He than appeared before his draft board on 17

2
3

March 66 and the notes of the clerk, or the minutes of that

4

meeting appear on page 17-A of the appendix., and they were

5

very important, because the notes of the minutes of that

3

meeting are later posed by the Government as being pertinent

7

in this case.
Then the appeals process ~ as you remember in

II

\

those days you made an application to the appeal board and the]
appeal board refers the matter to the United States Justice
Department and the United States Justice Department at that
|

time appointed under the statute, a hearing officer, who was
t© have a hearing on good faith and character of the regis­
trant o
In this case it is important that the hearing
officer was an ex-judge, retired judge from the system ©f
Kentucky, a man in his sixties who had been on the bench for
many numbers of years.

Add this judge had this hearing.

His

18
19

20
21

22

name was Judge Grauman.
Mow, Judge Grauman heard several witnesses.

He

also had in front ©f him, the records show, an FBI Report of
about six inches „

He also was given at the hearing

two

books, one of which is called? "The Message to the Black Men,” :
23
...

written by the Honorable Elijah Muhammad? another book entitled.
24
"The Holy Q«re&n,t! by Muhammad All — not our Muhammad All?
25

4

1

another„
And there was also introduced a copy of a news­

2
3

paper which is put out by his sect of Muslims, called?

4

"Muhammad Speaks„w

5

opportunity to determine the credibility of the witnesses and

6

he could determine whether, hew much credence to put into the

7

testimony of -the people who appeared in front ©f him»

8

Judge Grauman wrote his report and his report appears on page

9

X7-A*

10
11

12

Letter," which is written fcy the Attorney General — was
written by the Selective Service System -- I mean the Justice
Departmento
And this is where we consider the crux ©f this
case, is in the so-called "Advice Letter»"
Nov;, the hearing officer wrote his report and h©

15
1©

17
18
1©

20

And,

In some of his notations in what we call "The Advice

13

14

Now, Judge Grauman, he had the first

concluded at page 117-A in the appendiss that? "The Registrant
was sincere in his objections on a religious ground to parV

ticipate in war in any form"and he recommended that the scon­
scientious objector claim of the registrant be sustained,
notwithstanding <,
■

21

At that time the Justice Department had a con­
scientious objector section and all letters were written by a

j

22
23
24
25

man by the name of T» Oscar Smith, who was in charge of the
section»
Smith»

And this letter was written back, signed by T, Oscar j
And then, after having said that the Hearing Officer:
5

1

had found the

2

quotes from "Muhammad Speaks/' several lines from the mews-

3

paper

4

-- that is, -the writer of the letter, gives his opinion of

5

what Muhammad Speaks says and what the Message of the Black

egistrant sincere; then at page 120-A lie then

■ I
Muhammad Speaks/’

Then in the next paragraph he gives

'

6

Man says, on page 120 and the beginning of 121.

7

Then he gives this ©pinions "It seems clear" ~

8

18m reading these two documents — "that the teachings of the

9

Mation of Islam preclude fighting for the United States, not

I
j

!

10

because of objection to participation in wax in any form, but i

11

rather because of political and racial objections to policies
.

12

of the United States as interpreted by Elijah Muhammad."
Then he goes on and he reads part ©f a. hypothetica],

13
14

question which Muhammad Ali, the Registrant, had answered at

15

the hearing, before the hearing officer.

16

of the Registrant Is testimony,aand then he comes to this con­

17

clusion:

18

Then he quotes part

S3Xt is therefore our conclusion that the Regis­

19

trant's claimed objection t© participation in wars insofar as

20

they are based upon the teachings of theMafeiom of Islam, rest

21

on grounds which are primary political and racial/’

22

Mow, we say that when these men who are on the

23

Appeal Board, who had to read this Advice Letter with this

24

language, they interpreted it like we interpret it, that this

25

is '^he same as saying that the — his objections to the war

I

:

6

!

i

were based on political and racial grounds and not on his

2

religious training and beliefs,
Nov?, we understand that now the Government in its

3
4

brief — page 27 in the

5

that language was not intended t© say they were not religious,

S

Mow the Government says that this language was — or that Mu-

7
8

'Government8s brief — now says that

hammed Ali was one who had his beliefs rooted in religious
training and belief,

-•

But now they say that political and racial„ and

B
10

if you interpret it, they say that the record infers the in-,

11

ference that Petitioner would fight "tomorrow” in a defensive
•l
war on behalf of Muslims, This reminds us of the case of

12
13

Sicurella where the hypothetical question was put to a

14

Jehovah9® Witness of% what would they d© if s© and so; ©r "if

15

so and so.*
Now, they havertaken some language juxtaposed

16
17

18
19

against other language, and they come to this conclusion, but
nowhere in the record has the Registrant aver said that he
would fight with weapons against anybody.

To what extent do the Black Muslims follow

the teachings ©f the Koran?

the war against the church, was in the; same opinion in Sicurel

the Registrant or the Petitioner, or any of his co-religionists say this.

MR. GRISWOLD:

May it please the Court:

This is an appeal from a judgment sustaining a
i

20

conviction for refusal to report for induction.

21

of course, is the question of whether the order to report for

22

induction was valid.

23

24
25

The defense,

And in the posture of the case as it

now stands, that turns on the propriety of the action of the
Selective Service System with respect t© a claim of con­
scientious objection.

14

{
l

1

The claim was duly filed on the 'System's form

2

SS 150» and was considered by the local board in Kentucky and

3

was denied by that board.

4

from that decision and under the procedure which was then

5

established by law the matter was referred to a division ©f

6

the Department«of Justice,

The Petitioner here took an appeal

j

The statute provided» upon the
I

7

filing of such appeal that appeal boards shall refer at such

&

time to the Department of Justice for inquiry and hearing and 1
|
the Department of Justice » after appropriate inquiry» shall

9
10

hold a hearing.

11

And then it provided that the department should

12

make its report t© the appeal board» either way and said --

the statute said? rtThe appeal board shall» in making its

And that procedure was followed her®.

There was

a hearing conducted by an able and experienced hearing officer'
and he made his report» including a transcript of the testiraony and the voluminous number of exhibits

©f Justice» where it was reviewed» along with the experience
which the department's officers had from reviewing many other
hearings in this type of matter and the Department ©f Justice

of the application of this Court’s decision in the Welch case.

12

Now, the transcript ©f the hearing before the

important for the Court to bear in mind what the nature of

15

that hearing was.

m
19
20

It was not an adversary proceeding.

The

Government was not represented except through the hearing
officer# who# it is perfectly plain# acted in the most impar­
tial way and asked questions for the purpose of clarifying
things for his own mind# but not in an adversary way.
Sio evidence was offered on behalf of the Govern­

21

ment at this hearing# either with respect to the beliefs ©f

22

the Black Muslim sect or with respect to the beliefs of the

23
24

provided in the statute that the judgment of the draft board

And the Court has said that the standard of

Many years ago in the Estep case the Court said*,

The decision of the

not an adversary proceeding, should go one way or another, but1

I

whether there is any basis in fact that the decisions had been;
reached by the administrative agencies and by -the courts
below.
And then 1 would call attention to this Court8s

decision in the Wittmer case in 348 U.S. where the Court saids:

The classification can be overturned only if

Here the determination has been made by the draft

board; approved by two state appeal boards, by the national

appeal board and if the Court follows the no-basis-in-fact

your arguments the basis in fact was not, I suppose, like the

15

A

16

Our position is that the question of

sincerity is not before the Court now, not having been raised

17

in. the petition and not having been covered by the grant of

We think that the question of sincerity was pro­

That is the only question that is covered

Welch because the denial to Petitioner of a conscientious,
objector's exemption may have been based upon the Department
of Justice's erroneous characterisation of his objections to
participations in wars as political and racial, rather than
religious.
A

Well, then we're not involved with

selective objection? are we?
Q

Well, Mr. Justice, 1 believe it does, just

as in the Negre case, 1 think this case has been, in effect,
d@cid®d by the Negre case and that it is, in fact, indistinguisfaabX® from the Negre case.

I
Now, let us look back at the Negre case.
21

There is

^1

1

a case where objection was undeniably religious? nobody

2

questioned from beginning to end that Mr. Negre was anything

3

but a sincere and devout Catholic, deriving his belief from

4

instruction in the church and from teachings of the fathers„

5

He believed, on undoubtedly religious grounds that it was his

6

duty to participate in just wars and his duty not to parti-

1

eipate in unjust wars.
Now, the Government never contended in any way

8
9

that his objections were other than religious in nature,

10

nevertheless the Government did contend that they were poli­

n

tical and practical.

12

of religion.

13

is that it is not enough that the objection be religious but

u

it must also be an objection to participation in wars in any

15

form.

This is a contention within the concepts.
j

m

The Government's argument sustained by the Court!

And without that the Court's discussion of the

17

establishment and the free exercise clauses of the First

m

Amendment in its opinion, a very helpful and constructive

'19

discussion would have been wholly unnecessary because that is •
|

20

relevant only if the objections are clearly religious and so

21

22
23

' they were and s© we concede her®, that the objections are
i

religious.
But the distinction between just and unjust wars

24

though surely having a religious basis in Negre's mind,

25

injected political and philosophical consideratioris into the
22

i

picture and it was with respect to this aspect, of the matter

2

that the Government contended in its brief that Negre's

3

position involved the judgment that is “political and par­

4

Similarly here , we d© not contend that the

The contention that it is

with its being religious»

If a man sincerely believes that

he can participate in racial wars or in just wars he is not
a person who is

opposed to participation in war in any form»

There is in this record, a basis in fact for the
.5^..

conclusion that the Petitioner’s objection, though religious,
is selective* How, that is that he is not opposed t© parti­
cipation in wars in any form as the statute requires, but that
is, in fact, opposed t© fighting what he regards as the
white man’s wars although having no religious or conscientious
scruples against participation in war which would defend the
Black man's interests*
Q-

You don't question the sincerity of his

as

1

claim?

2

A

No, Mr. Justice? we do not.

3

Q

Nor, as I understand it? the fact that it

4

was religiously rooted, religiously founded.
A

5

Certainly not, Mr. Justice.

We assert that

6

it was religiously rooted just as we did in Negre.

7

could have conceivably contended in Negre ‘that his objection

8

was not religion.

I assuge you are going to deal with the

Sicurella case, Mr. Solicitor General?
A

25

Yes, Mr. Justice.

The Petitioner just

doesn't want to fight the white man's wars, and I can under»
stand that, but it’s not the same sort of belief as the
opposition to participation in war in any form which is held
by the pacifists and is required by the statute.
!

Surely, as has been pointed out, the traditional
historical Moslem religion is not pacifist.

One need only

refer to the Crusades and to the more recent Seven Days Wars
as adequate evidence of that fast.
And, although my counsel for the Petitionerhere

differentiated his client from the traditional Moslems, I woule
point out that they introduced in evidence in support of his
position a modern, standard translation of the Koran, a
translation'by a Pakistani, not by a member of the Black
Muslims.

Xt9s equally sure, it seems to me that the Black
24

i

1

Muslim religion is not regarded as pacifist in the sense, at

2

leasts that the Quakers and Mennonites are pacifists.
As this record shows there are strong racial

beliefs.

exactly parallel fc© that already reached by the Court in

7

Megre, that the objections of the Petitioner here, though un-

Mow there is, thus a basis in fact, for a conclusioni

doubtedly religious, as Negre's were, are in fact, selective.

8

A different selection, to be sure, than that made by Megre,

©

but nevertheless selective and thus not within the statutory

prescription which allows conscientious objection to those who'

11

are opposed to participation in war in any form.

with the traditional Muslim religion is by no means complete

Q

And

I had understood that the Nation ©£ Islam

20

21

©r the Methodist Church.

22

To me tills is rather important.

23

A

Maybe I misunderstood the record„

I shall refer to some parts of the record

24

which 2 think will support the fact that there is a basis in

25

fact for saying that his objections are selective? that is,

26

1

that lie is not opposed to participation in war in any form,

2

but that he wants to pick and choose his wars, and that his

3

pick is essentially a racial and political choice.
Now, of course, in reviewing the case the Court

4

S

will undoubtedly give close and careful attention to the

6

report or advice letter of the Department of Justice.

7

with the benefit of hindsight one goes through this letter

8

If,

looking for flaws, one can find some natters that might 'have

9

been written differently, but if the letter is read from the

10

beginning to end in its entirety, one will conclude, I think,

11

that it is a very carefully thoughtful letter, written by a

12

responsible officer in the special section of the Department

13
14

©f Justice which was set up for the purpose ©f examining into j
these difficult questions and which they were not binding on

'Timm objections are mad® to the letter and they
donet present easy questions and if ©n@ reads the Petitioner's

On more careful examination, however, X

believe that the views expressed in the Department of Justice hi

2

Court5s decision# both before and after tha letter was

3

written.
And 1 think it should be borne in mind that the

endeavored to deal with this.

1 have already!

It is, I believe# entirely

refuted by the Keg res case itself.

No one questioned that

Negress views were based on religious belief# yet they were
found by the Court to b@ so political in essence# so inconsistent with the pacifist position which Congress has recog»nised in the statute? a pacifist posit,ion which need not b@
based on orthodox religion as it was# but nevertheless# must

j

still be a pacifist position# that they are not a basis for

exemption.
And the Court, specifically held that this was con*™;
sistent with the First Amendment.

I

Similarly here# as I have said# the Petitioner’s
views are religious; that’s not questioned# but they are also ;
selective# just as Negre’s were.
28

And the Petitioner’s

1

opposition to war is not total? there are political and

2

racial exceptions to his objections and there may be room

3

to argue about the evidence on this, but there is much

4

evidence that it is so and thus there was an adequate basis in

5

fact for the conclusions reached.
Probably the most difficult case for us on this

6
7

point is the Sicuralla decision, where the Court

3

surely do not disagree, that the willingness ©£ a Jehovah5s

9

11

12

Witness t© participate at some time in a theocratic war withou
carnal weapons, was not a sufficienfbasis for denying him exemption on the ground that he was not opposed t© participation
in war in any form.
How, there is some related material in this

I

May I ask you before you get under way and

2

avoid an interruption» perhaps — 185 of the appendix» the

3

beliefs recited "We do not believe this nation"— that is the

4

United States» the reference is there —"should fores us to

S

take part in such wars for we have nothing to gain from it

6

unless it agrees to give us tine necessary territory wherein

7

we may have something to fight for»"
Would it be an unreasonable inference from that

11
12

statement of the belief that if» for example» hypothetically»
even though unlikely» there was seme kind of agreement to give
Hawaii or Texas or Alaska or some other area to the Black
Muslim Mation that then they would fight?
Would that be a reasonable inference to draw frora

.tod in the 1

Carson case I would like to read you something that the Depart­

is based on "political, social, economic considerations and

not religious," so that they are taking the position in the
Carson case that he was not religious and they are taking the
position here.

I sense a prejudice against the so-called

"Black Muslims" that appears in the Government’s brief and in
which it appears against this Defendant, who was the Heavy­
weight Champion of the World, and who had announced he was a
Muslim.
i
tod with that, we submit, Your Honor,that this
contrived language and the Advice Letter, now we don’t say
that the Advice Letter is on® that8 s put to the Members of the
Supreme Court.

j
This Advice Letter went to laymen who made up j

the appeal board of Kentucky.

They had to read this letter,
36

I

and if you- all can't get this interpretation? how did this

2

appeal board?
/

3

We say in Sicurella that if there are two

4

erroneous groundse in her© they admit the sincerity? in thev

S

Advice Letter they did not admit the sincerity.

6

Letter the language is such that they didn't even admit that

io

In the Advio

he was even religious.
So? we are sayinge Your Honor's? that you will
have to reverse on the grounds of Sicurella because these
issues axe the issues in this case and not

- how the Justice

Department finds them.
