ORAL ARGUMENT BY DON H. REUBEN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. REUBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This suit for libel had its inception in a raid

m

led by the Respondent on the West Side apartment of a 'Black

ii

family in the City of Chicago in the year 1958.

12

name was Monroe and at that time the Respondent was the deputy

'13

chief of detectives of the City of Chicago.

The family's

14

Shortly after the raid the Monroe family brought an

15

action in the Federal District Court in Chicago,, alleging that

IS

the raiding party, and specifically that the Respondent,

ty

Captain Pape, broke the doors down, woke the Monroe couple with

18

flashlights, forced them at gunpoint to leave their bed and

19

stand naked in the center of the living room; roused the six

20

children that were in -the apartment at that time; herded them

21

into the living room; that the Respondent struck Mr. Monroe

22

several times with a flashlight, calling him "nigger/8 and

23
24
25

"black boy;" that another officer pushed Mrs. Monroe; that the
children were hit and kicked and that the police ransacked
ever}/ room, throwing clothing from closets to the floor, dumping

2

1

drawers and ripping mattress covers and the like.

2

The cause ultimately reached this Court and this

3

Court held in 1961, in Monroe versus Pape, that the cause of

4

action was stated on behalf of Monroe and against Captain

5

Paper,

6

Then, in November of 1961 the Civil Rights Commis­

7

sion issued its fifth report, which is entitled? "Justice,"

8

Pertinent excerpts of justice appear in . Appendix 323.,

9

Chapter II of Justice deals with police violence, and itss

W
11

headed, "Unlawful Police Violence."
The Commission says in Chapter II that the allega­

12

tions of misconduct are supported in several cases by criminal

13

convictions and findings by impartial agencies and others by

14

sworn testimony, affidavits from eyewitnesses or by staff field

15

investigations.

conclusively whether the complaints or the officers were

17

correct in their statements.

In no case has the Commission determined

This is the functionof a court.

The Commission said it was of the opinion that the

19

allegations appeared substantial enough to justify discussion

the dissent, of Justice Frankfurter in Monroe versus Pape and

the Commission’s lead was to says "The Supreme Court of the

United States decided the case of Monroe versus Pape on

February 20th, 1361»

7

of the ease, it did permit the Plaintiff to sue several

8

Chicago police officers for violation of the Federal Civil

9

Rights Act on the basis of a complaint which that,"

10

The Commission did so by using the language of

hithough’ decision did not finally dispose

and then

Justice Frankfurter's opinion was quoted»

11

Time, Incorporated, upon receiving the Commission

12

Report, wrote an. article and published it in the ensuing edition

of Time.

1

pertineat evidence to this cause shows that the author or the

2

man that originally wrote the story, dropped the word

3

“alleged/1 or did not indicate in his reporting of the event

4

that this material that came from the Civil Rights Commission

5

Report was in turn-, a statement of Justice Frankfurter's

6

statement of the complaint.

7

He was asked specifically and it is at page 12 of

8

our brief and it's Appendix 208 and 209, why he dropped the

9

word “alleged."

He saids "The word alleged cannot be taken

10

just in that contexti it has to be taken in the context of the

1!

entire chapter."

12

in this case is reporting this incidant

in terms of the claim

13

being made in the court by the Monroes.

But you can't stop

14

there.

15

simple allegation because the Commission has also said that

16

8wa will not include just an allegation that we have not veri­

17

fied in some fashion..,’"

'18

Q

He says, "It means to me that the Commission

In the context of the entire chapter it is not a

It wasn't just a negligent omission, then?

19

was it?

20

the word "alleged?13

21

22

It was a thoughtful, knowing, deliberate omission of

A
"deliberate?"

Well, I think. Captain Pape would call it
I call it "conscious " omission.

23

Q

Well, it was knowing, anyway?

24

A

Yesi absolutely.

25

Q

He knew exactly what he was doing.

1

A

2

After

3

Q

4

Absolutely»

After this Court's decision in Monroe against

Pape, did Mr. Monroe proceed in
A

5

his action against Mr. Pape?

Yes, hs did, Mr. Justice Stewart.

He ob­

S

tained a verdict and judgment, which was paid and was not

7

appealed.

8

didn't know at the time, because it hadn't happened yet.

9

it has happened while this libel suit was pending.

10
11

12

However, in candor, the author at Time, Incorporated!,

Q

And

It happened, however, after the institution

of -this libel suit?
A

Yes, sir.

And that was called to the

13

Seventh Circuit's attention and they said that it would not

14

have any relevance in this causa.

13
16

U

Q

Wall, despite the chronology, do you think

it's of any relevance?
A

I certainly do.

I think it would be a

W

travesty to say that the Respondent here has a right to sue for

19

libel when he's been found guilty of the ultimate sting (?) of

20

the article of violating Monroe's civil rights.

21

Q

Well, not guilty, perhaps, but —

22

A

Well,—

23

Q

— not beyond the preponderance of the

24
25

evidence to be civilly liable.
A

We used the term guilty in the Circuit Courts
6

1

in Chicago»

2
3

Q

I suppose it might be argued contra that

the article contributed to that result

4

A

Welly I suspect that that was something that

5

Captain Pape would have addressed to the Court in the Monroe

6

versus Pape case, or taken an appeal if he had thought that

7

that was truly the result»

8
9

Q

Welly of course„ the officer might have been

found guilty of, or found liable for violating civil rights ,

10

without having committed the acts which are alleged in the

11

story.

12

A

That's true, Mr, Justice White»

13

Q

You are conceding a rather critical point •—

14

A

Welly I suggest to you that the courts looked

IS

to the sting of the article and the sting of the article was;

18

he violated the civil rights of the Monroes, which is the sting

17

of the verdict»

18

Q

Welly I know, bufcy I mean, to recover at all

19

on a libel suit you just don't find whether somebody was stung

20

or not stung»

21

untruey for another thing»
A

You find whether the statements were true or

Welly as I understand the law of libel, a

substantial truth is allowed and if the gist of the libel is a
violation of the civil rights of Monroe ~=
Q

I gather the way they found in this case that
7

1

at least it can be said* that the report that was published

2

was a false report of what was said in the Civil Rights Report,

3

A

This is what the Court of Appeals —

4

Q

Well* that8s one of them and secondly* it was

5

— must have been found by the jury that the statements sub­

6

stantively were false? some of them* anyway.

7

A

But the case never went to the jury..

The

8

District Judge took the case from the jury and dismissed it.

9

It was the Court of Appeals that made that.

IQ

The article after —

11

Q

12

stantively —

13

A

14

Q

15

It has never been found in this case sub­

That’s correct.
whether any of the statements in the

Civil Rights Report are true or false?

16

A

That’s correct.

17

Now* I want to go on to the editorial process*

be­

18

cause it didn’t just stop with the article being written by Mr.

19

Magnuson.'

20

Q

Excuse me.

May I ask about — do you concede

21

or do you not concede -that the report as published did state

22

a falsehood ~ did make a false statement?

23

A

I do not concede it* but theDistrictJudge

24

assumed it for the purpose of deciding the motion at the close

25

of all the evidence ~
8

1

Q

Well, 1 know, but I would like your position,

2

A

My position is 1 do not concede that it is

Q

In. other words, you say there is no false

3

false,

4
5

statement in the article?
A

6
7

before the Court at this moment ~
Q

8
9

That is correct, but I don't think that's

We treat the case then as though -there were

some false statements?

m

A

1!

After the

12

Q

I don't follow that.

13

A

Because the District Judge did not -- no trial,

14

of fact has decided this.
Q

15

m

I -thinJ?; you have to,

1 have to be candid.

Why do we have to --

The tryer of fact, the District —

1 know, but we never get to the New York Times

rule unless there is a false statement; do we?
A

17

That's why you haveto assume

18

And of course that there's actual malice.

19

the District Judge went off on here,
Q

20

it's false.

That's the issue that

Yes, but we don't have to assume it's false,

21

do we?

All we have to assume was -there was enough there to

22

submit the issue of falsity or not to the ~

23

A

That's correct,

24

Q

That's a very different proposition,

25

A

That is correct.
9

1

Q

Well, don51 you have to assume, if not con-

2

cede, that it®© an inaccurate report of the Commission Report

3

that it was purporting to be reporting?

4

A

No, 1 do not.

I do not»

And the author, 1

5

think, isade it. very clear that as he read the entire Civil

6

Rights Commission Report it was not an inaccurate report.

1

Civil Rights Commission, and that8s the thrust of his testimony!

8

the Civil Rights Commission was not merely reporting Mr.

9

Monroe’s allegations in the complaint, but the Civil Rights

10

Commission, by its open statement, by its headlines, by the

11

mere inclusion

12

independent finding that this was a case of substance that

13

merited discussion and that this was precisely the view of the

14

dissenting judge in the first opinion, pre New York Times

15

when the case was decided;on state law.

The

of the Pape case, was making a, if you will, an

Q

If wq affirm will this case go to trial all

18

A

No, sir.

19

Q

What went to the jury?

20

A

Nothing went to the jury.

21

Q

Well, why is the case over?

22

A

Because the District Judge dismissed the

16
17

23
24
25

over again?
The case is over.

The District —

case at the close of the evidence
Q

~ that there was sufficient evidence to

prove Tima's malice.
10

1
2

A

If you reverse the case is over? if you

affirm then the case goes back to the jury.

3

Q

That’s what I asked ~“

4

A

I*m sorry.

S

Q

Could I ask you a questions does 'the record

I misunderstood you.

6

show what Idle considerations were that led Tim® to deliberately

7

omit the word "alleged”?

8

getting at is: what is the difference between the news value of

9

one and the less news value of the other? put it that way.

1©

A

In other words, I guess what I’m

Well# I guess that the best answer to that

11

is to review what Time did here.

Mr. Magnuson* as his

12

testimony I read to the Court indicated that he thought# from

13

the reading of the Civil Rights Commission Report as a whole

14

that this was# as ha said# "There is more than an allegation

15

of a complaint being reported here."

16

Additionally- after the article was written and I

M

think the Court has to look at this article as though it was

13

uttered by Time# Incorporated — you would have to look at the

19

whole editorial process.

20

department and the morgue on Captain Papa or the reference file

21

which they had was taken by an independent researcher and ithere

22

was discovered a number of material on Monroe versus Pape# in­

23

cluding a New York Post article which is in the record# and

24

including Time’s own in-house dispatches#' which indicated that

25

the incidents reported by the Civil Rights Commission# in the

The article was sent to a research

11

i

1

words of Justice Frankfurter, “were true,” and a combination of

2

the researcher’s independent judgment, plus the editor5s judg­

3

ment, plus the writer's judgment, resulted in an editorial

4

decision; in an editorial decision to publish this material in

5

the form that’s before the Court.

6

And, in the Mew York Times case, and in the St.

7

Amant case, -the test is, of actual malice, is whether there was

8

a publication made by one who published, knowing it was false

9

and intending to do harm through a falsehood or as Justice

10

White said in St. Amants

11

and nevertheless, publishing, intending to do harm by publish­

12

ing falsehood."

13

"A high degree of awareness of falsity,

There is not. one thing in this record that indicates

14

that this author ©r this researcher or Time, Incorporated, had

15

any knowledge of falsehood or had any awareness of falsehood.

16

Rather, what we believe and what the District Judge held, and

1?

what two judges, or at least the first dissenting Circuit Court

18

Judge held was that a fair reading of the Civil Rights material

19

alone could lead to t he conclusion that 'the report bout Pape

20

in the Civil Rights Commission ***»« true. ,

21

read the dissent in the first Pape case decided pre New York

22

Times, and you see there a Court of Appeals Judge looking at

23

the four corners of justice, and saying in his dissent that a

24

reasonable person could read "Justice,” and conclude that

25

Time’s report was an accurate report of “Justice."

12

And I suggest if you

That, if an

1

independent judgment like that can be made then it's passing

2

strange to say that the author had either knowledge of falsity

3

in reading "Justice/’ or had a high degree of awareness of

4

falsityo

S

Nov;, the. Seventh Circuity which reversed Judge

6

Robinson0s holdings feo allow this case to; go t© the jury •.

7

would have a chilling effect on the First Amendment* singled

8

out — singled out the. word "alleged*" or the dropping of the

9

word "alleged*" and on that basis and on that basis alone* held

10

that the case had to go to the jury on the issue of actual

11

malice»

12

and what you see* I submit to Your Honors* is a majority by

13

any court in the country to give lip service to Your Honors'

14

decisions in New York Times and its progeny* Sfc» Amant and the

15

cases in between* and nevertheless* within the framework of

16

giving all the pious utterances possible to New York Times* to

1?

hold that a libel occurred or that actual malice occurred by

18

singling out one factor and at least three vices.in ^hat the

19

Court of Appeals did and what occurred here»

20

It was that single facet that prompted every reversal

Q

Then I think that part of your.; submission

21

isn't that the First Amendment would preclude a holding that

22

leaving out the word "alleged*" would be libelous?

23

A

No,

24

Q

If the underlying statements were false*

25

My “*ra

leaving outfche word "alleged*" you would say could fairly be
13

1

libelous.per se?

2.

A

3

It might»

I say not in this case.

In this

case I think it cannot —

4

Q

5

A

I mean wholly aside from malice?
That8s correct, because of the contents of

6

'Mustice," I think/ and when the first case was decided/ of the

7

four judges that heard its one District Court and one Court of

8

Appeals Judge/ they held that under the state law pre New York

9

Times, that it was not a libel/ that it was a fair report of

to

"Justice," within the four corners.
Nowr I ha not sure that that rises to trie dignity —

11
12

1 have to

of a First Amendment right/ but wa

13

incorrect decision/ in my judgment, and it is not libelous,

14

think that the Time, Incorporated article was a fair report of

15

"Justice,"
Q

18

it was an
1

But, absent other things inthe "Justice"

17

article, which would take the edge off of the word "allege,"

18

if that's all -there was, was the report, the "Justice," report

19

saying"allegedly" so and so happened, and that word were left

20

out you would say that therew ouldn1t be anything unconstitu­

21

tional in holding that to be libel?

22

A

23

because the mere act of putting it into a section on police

24

brutality and using those incidents, collective incidents all

25

over the country, and using those incidents as a basis for a

-?

A

Although it would be, in my judgment, wrong,

14

1

recommendation to Congress concerning how remedial legislation

2

should be enacted, takes it out of the category of just the

mere allegation of a complaint ~~

That is the issue that I think has come

before the Court the way -the- case was pitched? that's correct.

8

Q

9

A

You would have to? yes, sir.

10

Q

And really whether it's malicious or not?

11

A

We're assuming libelous falsity, falsehood

Yes, sir? you have to do that, absolutely.

12

And it is our position, if you will, that the record shows that

13

based upon all of the facts of the contents of "Justice," and

14

the morgue clips, would suggest to any reasonable person that

15

this is true? that it is incorrect for the Court of Appeals, to
_>

16

if you will, second guess the editorial practice and the

1?

editorial decision of Time, and to say that use ~ or no use of

18

language is tantamount to uttering deliberate falsehood? or is

19

tantamount to ordering

20

even suggest there was a high degree of awareness? they pitched

21

it solely on the grounds of deliberate falsehood.

22

well, the Court of Appeals didn't

Furthermore, 1 suggest the Court of Appeals only

23

want one step and said, well, you — well, in their view you

misstated a report or government.

believed that the ultimate facts were true then there can be no

Yes, but then — cn that assumption they

of their own.

1

Time was relying on its own belief and investigation, why didni;

8

it say so or avoid saying the Civil Rights Commission said so?

They were saying the Civil Rights Commission was

Well, I9m suggesting to you that in some

respects they did make their own .investigation by going to —-

11

Q

That isn't what the story says.

12

A

No? that's correct.

13

Q

That is correct.

So far as the reader is concerned, it was the

U

Civil Rights Commission that was saying this as a matter of

15

fact.

16

A

And X9m suggesting to the Court that whether

n

the Civil. Rights Commission — whether Time states it on its

18

own authority, or on the Civil Rights Commission's authority,

19

that Time, Incorporated believed the ultimate fact to be true,

20
21

that the test for actual malice is not satisfied.
That if Time, Incorporated, believed the ultimate

22

fact to be true, whether it says it on its authority or the

23

Civil Rights Commission's --

24
25

Q

Although in this case it's conceded that the

writer knew he v;as leaving out the word "alleged,*3 and he did

it thoughtfully and knowingly and if he was "wrong in assuming

a

that that8s what the Civil Rights Commission meant he knowingly

misstated the Civil Rights Commission.

1 think you have come to thefeeart of the

matter.

6

wrong in misreading the Civil Rights Commission is enough.

7

think you have to have him deliberately intending to falsify

what the Civil Rights Commission said.

ORAL MUMMI BY PATRICK W. DONNE, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

2

MR. DONNEs

3
4

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
President Nixon last summe made certain remarks in

5
6

regard to the Manson trial and in regard to the Mylai matters,

7

and the press attacked him very vehemently for failure to use

8

the word "allege."
A week ago Saturday night, President Nixon had a

9
10

press conferens® and he said he was wrong.

1!

the report of a high governmental group which used the word

12

"allege." They reported what the Commission said as fact, but'

13

Time magazine will never say they are wrong.

14

The author of this article —

15

Q

Time magazine read

I thought the posture of the case had finally

16

moved to the point where they said, "Yes, we’re wrong, but we

17

have no malice."

18

A

They said that they intentionally said some­

19

thing different than the Commission Report, but that they had a

2v

right to do it and could do if, and were not wrong.

21

suppose, based upon an argument that in sane way the end justi-

22

fies the means that because, I suppose after 308 pages, which

23

was the Commission’s report, the Commission finally came to the

24

conclusion that there was police brutality in the United States"

-

25

having reviewed many, many cases.
18

Because, I

1

I suppose that is the ultimate truth or the ultimate

2

which Time feels justifies its improper means of saying,

3

eliminating, omitting words like “allege" and "complaint.4!

4

The author clearly says he read the words "alleged* in the

5

complaint! he understood them, but he chose to omit them»

6

omission of words, we submit, is a known falsity and meets the

7

test of malice in your terras.

3
9

Q

The

Well, then you distinguish this from a case

where the writer had put the word "allege" in but the fellow

10

who put the print together down in the print shop, inadvertently

11

dropped it because it was at the end of a line?

12

13
14
15
16

A

It makes all the difference in the world, Mr.

Chief Justice.
Q

And what is the difference?

What would that

do to t he ease?
A

The man who inadvertently in a print shop,

17

drops out the word "allege" is doing an act ~ an unintentional

18

act, an unintentional act, whereas —

19

Q

But it bears only on the malice.

20

A

It bears only on malice! true, but it bears

21

only on malice.

But that is an unintentional act.

22

Here the man knew what he was doing, new it, intended

23

to do it and left it out and of course the -thing comes out t© be

24

something quite different then.

25

What the Commission said, first of all, and what.

19

1

2
3
4

Time was ostensibly reporting»
Q

1 might ~

Doesn't it some exactlythe same as far as the

reader is concerned?
A

Oh, it coraes out quite the same, but my

5

point is -that we do agree

6

agree with New York Times — when this Court said that there

7

must be malice and malice is, of course, the known falsity, or

8

the right to disregard or whether the falsity is true or not»

9

Q

we do agree that this

we do

So then we move from there, do we not, to

10

the question of whether the conscious choice to drop the word

11

"allege,'9 is proof of malice or evidence of malice? don't we?

12

A

Sure, sure? and what couldbe a better proof

13

of malice, then have someone knowingly -- knowingly, report

14

something different from smother document»

IS

I might say that this is quite similar to —-

16

the contentions here are qui.te similar to the contentions

17

that Time Magazine has made in the recent District Court case

!8

of Ragano, which recently has been sent back and the denial of

19

the motion for summary judgment was upheld by the Circuit

20

Court of Appeals»

2!

In the Ragano case, the same contentions were mad®»

22

The Court there, after having reviewed other motions for summary

23

judgment where the question was investigation and so on, and

.24

so forth, the motion had been granted, the court said? S!The

25

present case differs» however, because Time had actual
20

1

i

malic®g knowledge of the fact that the plaintiff was an

2

attorney

3

yet decided to disregard or omit this fact»
The First Amendment does not require that the

4

plaintiff show knowledge of falsity and then, as Time contends,

5

bad faith in the publisher's choice of disregarding th© truth.

S

Where the plaintiff presents evidence to show that the

7

publisher chose to substitute his opinion for facts actually

8

known by him in an article, that is capable of defamatory

3

meaning, he has come forward with sufficient evidence to show

10

reckless disregard.

11

This ease --

12

Q

, Would you say that the Time article was an

13

accurate representation, fair representation of the Commission's

14

Report?

15

h

Absolutely not.

IS

Q

In what respect —

17

A

Absolutely not.

The Time article, the Time article first of

10

all selected its couple of exampless one being the example of

19

an instance in Georgia employing not names, but initials, and

20

a very flambuoyant instance, coming out of the Commission's

21

Report? one involving murder ~~ more of 'this then they go on

22

down from the South to the North and talk about the incident

23

of Pape and they leave out the word -that the Commissi on said,

24

"as alleged in a complaint.”

25

high -- “the Commission found this police officer guilty ©f

And say “the Commission found a

21

1

these acts of police, brutality , destroying his effectiveness

2

in his own field of work.

3
4

So, absolutely it did not say, did not report what
that Commission Report said.
Q

5

Do you think the editorial judgment of the

6

author was in any way vindicated or aided by the subsequent

7

jury finding in the civil case by the preponderance of evidence'*
A

8
9

In no way.

First of all, I believe that even

the consideration of that in this instance is wholly wrong.

10

First of all, this — these facts — these allegations of the

ii

complaint set forth in Justice Frankfurter's opinion, will not

12

the allegations set forth in the complaints, which was -the sub-

3

ject matter of thejury verdict.
The complaint, after the Frankfurter opinion, was

4
5

amended twice and watered down completely.

There is no such

16

thing in the complaint as "Pape having hit Monroe with a flash­

17

light? Pape having called Monroe 'black boy,9 or anything ©£

8

that kind„“

That was the complaint that the jury verdict

9

brought in, was mush, much different.

I might further say that if you look at that one

enough, as far as Pape is concerned.

10

The Circuit Court of Appeals does

11

Malice, which is -this Court9s standard, is the

12

knowing of falsity or the reckless disregard of falsity.

13

cas© is presented to Court on a motion for directed verdict.

14

What this means, usually, is that if there is any evidence, not

15

a scintilla, of course, but, 'any evidence, any substantial

16

evidence from which a jury could find that Time Magazine was

17

guiity of a known falsity or reckless disregard of the truth,

With that prelude it says, "The Commission found

Q

Mr. Dunne, why do you think, or do you think

that Time Magasine could have had a good faith, nonmalicious
faith in the truth of the underlying allegations, but neverthe­
less, be liable in this case because it knowingly misstated it
the commission's report by leaving out the word "alleged.”
A

Well, if the Court please, I don't believe —

Let's just assume for the moment, though,

that Time had a good faith, nonmalicious belief in the truth
of the allegations about — that it made about Pape.

Let's

just assume that,
Wow, would Time nevertheless, be liable because
it left out the word "alleged," and misstated the Commission?
A

Yes.

For a number of reasons.
27

First of all,

Time wasn’t reporting its own judgment on the incident of

Mr. Reuben, neither you

nor your friend have said anything about whether tills man is

18

19

a "public figure," or "public official," or do you consider

20

that irrelevant?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY DON H. REUBEN, ESQ.

21

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

22

MR. REUBENs

23

I do not consider it irrelevant.

I

would consider it highly pertinent and indisputable that he is

24

a public official.

Is every policeman a public official?

X would think so, but 2 don't think you have

I

You say we don't have to say whether the

driver of the car was a public official?

13

A

14

Mr, Dunne argues malice from the tone of the article.

Hot in this case, although I 'think he is,

'15

As I read the cases of this Court, it usually is; what was the

16

editorial process?

17

authored the material?

18

and ifc3s an objective-subjective inquiry, if you will,

19

What was done by those who prepared and
Hot what was the final work product,

1 read in my opening statement, the testimony of

20

Mr, Magnuson and what he believed,

tinent

22

researcher, who had the article and had the morgue and who had

23

said,

24

which material will they use out of this particular quotation,

25

and checking back with my own editorial reference files 2

I think also highly per­

is the testimony which appears at Appendix 224 of the

"The writer had chosen, in conjunction with fha_editor,

35

1

believe that what we printed was an accurate representation

2

and we were not taking anything out of context»"

3

I think what the Court of Appeals and Mr. Dunne have

4

done is to confuse consciousness of the act, consciousness of

S

what they wrote and consciousness of what they did, with

6

knowledge of falsity»

The two are miles apart.

7

Q

Knowledge of falsity of what, Mr. Reuben?

8

A

Knowledge of falsity of the ultimate facts.

9

The ultimate facts ~

10

II

Q

Mr. Reuben, why would he take out the word

"allegedly," other than he believed that they were wrong?

12

A

Ke believed and Ms testimony is he believed

13

that in the context of st Justice," that the word "alleged" was

U

simply a device, an editorial device of the Civil Rights Com­

15

mission to introduce or discuss -the Pape case in the language

16

of Mr. Justice Frankfurter, which the Commission was apparently

17

smitten with — at least that was an accurate —

18

Q

Why is there this imperative need of him to

'19

take out the word "allegedly?"

20

For truth?

21

A

What is the imperative need?

Mr. Justice Marshall, 1 don't think there was

22

an imperative need, but I suggest to you that if tine case is

23

going to go on on whether there was an imperative need, then

24

you surely have a chilling effect on printing it if a court

25

can come back after some years — in this case, ten years after
38

1

the fact and say,- "Well, there’s a better way to say this —

2

Q

You mean it’s a chilling effect to tell

3

Time Magazine that when

4

should leave it as it is?

they are printing a direct quote they

S

What's chilling about that?

6

A

I suggest to you that the chilling effect is

7

to say to Time Magazine that although you honestly felt this

8

was true, you should have stated it in a different way and

9

because you didn’t state it a different way, because we dig-

10

agree Kith your editorial judgment, that you are guilty of

11

actual malice; you are guilty of knowledge of falsity.

12

You may disagree with their penmanship; you may dis­

13

agree with their choice of words; but I say that under the

14

cases of this Court unless the record shows with convicting

15

clarity that those choices of words reflect knowledge of

16

falsity and an intention to do malicious harm by pLhlinM-Uf that

17

falsity; that: there is no actual malice.

13

Q

Mr. Reuben, in this case is ?ime Magazine

19

not only was conscious of what it was doing, but knew that it

20

was misstating the Commission Report, but it believed in the

21

truth in this case of the underlying " allegations.

22
23
24
25

A

What then?

I say there is no liability; there is nothing

submissihle to the jury because -Q

So that Time Magazine is perfectly free, as

long as it says, "We had good faith belief in the underlying
37

1

allegations^ Time Magazine is free to say anything it wants to

2

about the Civil Rights Commission's report?

3

A

Within the context of what it believes to be

4

true; within the context of — of course that isn't this case.

5

But i within -the context of what it believes to be true it —

©

it can't go on and say that "Captain Pape," according to the

1

Civil Rights Commission, "did many other incidents."

8

it's — if it believes 'Idle ultimate facts are true and there

9

was a deliberate attempt here to misstate the Commission's

10

report, which I deny.

I say there is no liability.

11

nothing to go to the jury; there is no actual malice.

But if

There is

12

Q

Is that critical to your case or not?

13

A

No; X don’fcthink it is in this case;

14

absolutely not.

\
X think in this case I don’t even concede it was

15
16

false.

1 think in this case that the first District Court

17

decision and the first dissent was correct and this under

18

common law, prior to New York Times, was a fair report of a

19

governmental utterance and X aay that when two judges say so

20

it is passing strange to say that when an author so believes

21

he is guilty ©f publishing knowing falsity.

22

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

25

Thankyou Mr. Reuben; the

case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was concluded)
