MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; We'll hear arguments in No,

3

88, Messers Ramsey and Nunley against United Mine Workers,

4

Mr, Rowntree, you

5

HE, ROWNTREE; Mr, chief Justice and may it please the

6

may procede whenever you9re ready,

Court.
The Sourhern Tennessee Coal Producers involved in this

e

case, as Petitioners, charge 'that there was a conspiracy bar

9

tween major coal producers of the country, and the Respondent,

10

United Mine Workersv to restrict competition and to raise pri­

n

ces in the coal industry.

12

They charge that the amendments to the National Bituminous

13

Coal Wage Agreement were used to further the purposes of this

14

conspiracy,

15

The BCOA, the Bituminous Coal Operators Association, was

16

organized in 1950, largely through the efforts of Consolidation

17

Coal Company, the largest coal producer. The head of Consol­

18

idation testified in this case, with respect to his competitors,

19

that even though the competitor operated, in poorer mining

20

conditions whih less productivity than Consolidation did, still

21

you don't want him to ha,ve a lower wage scale than you if yon

22

can avoid it.

23

And after Consolidation organised BCOA, in 1950, BCOA

24

proceeded to negotiate whth UMW, throughout, the 19 505 s and

23

1960’s, amendments to the National Coal Wage Agreement of 1950,

2
1

!

These amendments consisted very largely of substantial

2

flat across the board wage increases applicable to fevery job

3

in the coal industry regardless of the productivity or -the

4

mechanization of the particular job.

5

These amendments were taken to the hundreds of other units

6

in the .industry outside of BCOA for signing. By 1958,, 82% of the

7

industry was thus organised under the national contract as thus

8

amended.

9

Than, in December^ 1958, with the next two largest coal

sO

associations participating, BCOA negotiated the 1958 amendment

1?

which included the protective wage clause. The PWC. The coal

\z

associations demanded that UMW sign paragraph A of the Pro­

13

tective wage clause, set forth at page 11, of our main brief.

14

This says that UMW will not enter into, become a party to,

IS

or permit any agreement or understanding other than national

!6

contract terms for the duration of the national contract.

17
18
19

This provision was in the face of the national Contract
throughout the damage period in this case.
The trial courts5 opinion shows that as a matter of fact,

20

the international union of UMW did not enter into, become a

21

party to, or permit, any agreement or understanding other than

22

national contract terms with any unit of the industry.

23

And this was true, even though the minting conditions, the

24

productivity, the ability to use the big new mining machinery,

23

tremendously varied across the country.

3

!

The repeated flat wage increases made rapidly increasing

2

productivity, increasing mechanization, an

3

for any company to stay alive» And from the national viewpoint,

4

from the findings of the trial court, there occurred an Indus™

5

trial revolution through mechanization in the coal industry in

6

the period 1950 — 1964^

7

absolute necessity

Productivity tripled in a few short years, nearly three-

8

fourths of the men were forced out of jobs in the industry»

9

The court also found that by 1960 the Class One, the largest

10

mines were rapidly regaining the dominant share of production,

II

that they held before Wound War II»

'

12

The court also found that if you put the whole coal indus­

13

try of the country together, taking out the two largest pro­

14

ducers, that the whole industry by 1960 was losing operating

15

losses of millioms of dollars a year under the national con­

16

tract’, while the largest companies were prospering. And taking

17

over the industry.

18

Nov;, that is the picture from the national scone. The

19

Southern Tennessee Field was completely organised by 1950»

20

But these flat rate'

21

southern Tennessee producers» The kraal court found that since

22

1960 there has not been a single incident of a successful coal

23

mining Operation in southern Tennessee under the national con­

24

tract. Even though the on.lv alternatives were to sign the con­

25

tract or go out of business»

This is primarily because of the physical way the

And we say that the reserves of the major companies

are adaptible to this big new machinery. With such fields as
southern Tennessee—0.

It's not because they’re major companies, is it, or

is it?
h

It?s> not because they have great reserves.

That's becasue of, I think, the nature of the coal

fields.

Well, the reserves of the major companies-—■ the

reserves of the major companies on the record do hold millions
of acres, billions of tons of reserves which are ideally lo­
cated, such as West Kentucky Coal Company, there’s a lot of
proof on those reserves and why UNW invested in Stem.
Now, the trial courts opinion shows that in the period of

by UMW tripled their share in the principal market of

While the southern TennesseefieId was in utter turmoil and

5

confusion, and down with strikes, because of the inability to

6

comply with this national contracto After the cancellation of

7

their contract in 1962 by the Union, with demands that they make

8

future guaranntees of performance the southern. Tennessee op­

9

erators organised an association and attempted to bargain with

1G

UMW a varying set of wage scales based upon the degree of mech­

12

anization of the productivity of the various types of mines in

12

southern Tennessee.

13

The UMW refused and demanded that the national contract

14

be signed again, but this time with guarantees of performance»

15

And the trial court found that the strike which followed was

16

because of the inability to negotiate a contract in the field»

17

And this strike was actually open warfare. It pervaded three

18

counties, it went on for three years, before. the trial,, it

19

was still going on at the ferial of this case»

20

And the trial court found that"several man were killed,

21

a great deal of violence, bloodshed and destruction of property

22

have accompanied this strike» Much suffering, deprivation, and

23

want have occurred» The southern Tennessee coal field remains

24

a blighted area»"

25

Now although the court found these facts both an the na6

1

; zonal level and ea the local levels the court hold the proof

2

fas. insufficient to show that the coarse of conduct of BMW

3

fas because of conspiracy or agreement of major coal com»

4

sanies and their associations.

5

'

The trial court held that this Paragraph a of the Pro­

6

tective Wage Clause could be construed as UMW contended that

7

t put a striaght jacketp or restraint, on UMW*s bargaining'

8

’reedow, only with respect to those companies that had gotten

0

•rganized ©r had signed up under the national contract-»

10

It held» thus* that it applied to the 82% of the industry

1!

hat was under the national contracte but not applicable to the

12

.8% that had not been organised under

13

[MW5 s contracts at that time*

14

the contracto Not under

Hows the court held that this difference made the re­

15

straint valid under anti-trust law» Beyond the express lang-

16

ag© ©f the contract, and the protective wage clause, the

17

oiirt went on tP- hold that the course of conduct of the inter-

18

iati©nal ani©n0 And the inter national officers in dealing with

19

he industry in the period of 14 - 15 years was such as to show

20

•y a preponderance of evidence that there was an implied agree-

21

®at with B COA that UMW would Negotiate only on rational cout­

22

rae t terms with all units ©f the industry, not just to the

23

2% but t© the 100% 0

24

25

But the court held that the Plaintiffs had the burden of
rooving this implied agreement sot jest by preponderance of

7

\

evidence from the Onions course of conduct but had the duty

z

to pr&ove it by the Clear Proofs Rule of Norris-LaGuardia

3

section six„ And there was an absence of such clear proof.

4

The court went on to hold that the evidence was in­

5

sufficient. to proove a predatory conspiracy to drive small

6

coal companies out of the industry., The court added at the

7

end of this conclusion that "Were it not for the clear proof

8

rule the court might have reached different conclusions."

9

Now it is obvious from the trial courts opinion through­

10

out that it was applying this clear proof rule all the way

n

to the p&int of reaching final conclusions as to anti- trust

12,

violation regardless of the clarity of proof of authorization

13

of the curs© of conduct of the international union and its

14

officers over this period of 14 years* regardless of that

15

obvious authorization.

16

The Clear Proof Rule was applied to that course of con­

17

duct to reach a conclusion as to whether that was a violation

18

of laws and the trial court rejected the majority

19

©pinions of this **©urt an the Pennington decision of 1965v

20

saying that neither ©pinion expressed a true majority rule

21

of this S@urt and it added that the problems posed to the

22

small and medium sized enterprises by the practice of national

23

collective bargaining would appear real and substantial» how­

24

ever that their solution lies in the Federal Anti-Trust lass

25

as now enacted by Congress is doubtful..
8

concurring

i

This was the decision just a few months after the de­

2

cision qf this Court remanding Pennington for trial under

3

the anti~trust laws

4

from this Courts opinions in Pennington which most impressed

•m»

the trial court was derived from the second footnote of the

6

majority opinion of Mr# -Justice White6

7

under similiar issues, The one point

We think the court misconstrued this footnote» Obviously

8

the court construed this footnote to mean that the Union needs

0

to deal in good faith bargaining only with the dominant unit

10

of the industry and over a period of 15 years can take the

11

resulting contracts and cram then do’Wh the throats of hundreds

12

of other units in all sorts of varying circumstances without

13

changing a single comma in a single contract over that whole

14

periodo Even though it means

15

petition» and even ‘though it means tragic offsets on three

16

fourths of the unions membership» while the favorite companies

17

grow and prosper and take over the industry,

obvious repression of com-

m

Mow a three judge panel at the Court of Appeals differed

19

with these vi©?;s of the law applicable to these circumstances

20

and thery reversed the judgements in favor of the UMW,

21

UMWs petition to rehear in bank the full court reconsidered»

22

split 4 ** 4 j and reinstated the judgements.

On

23

Under the first question we rsise here we contend that the

24

lower courts were in error in holding that to be successful the

25

Plaintiffs must show that this clearly, authorised course of
8

1

conduct of the international union and its officers must be

2

such as to show anti-trust violation,, not jest be a prepon­

3

derance of evidence9 but this clearly authorised course of

4

conduct amst be such as to shew clearly, unequivocally and con­

5

vincingly that anti-trust law was violated*,

6

Now section six of Horris-La Guardia by its very lang­

7

uage expresses marly a rule of evidence in, pro©vlog agency

e

or authorization of acts in a labor dispute» The section has

9

nothing to say about legal standards applicable in evaluating

10

clearly authorized coarse of conduct or clearly authorized

m

acts»

12

in evaluating the legality of such acts* the Act assumes

13

that acts have been done in a labor dispute which violate the

14

law and the statute is concerned with the proof of authorization

15

of those acts» St has nothing to say about what legal standards

16

are to be applied to determine whether the acts really were

17

unlawful»

18

Now all the issues in this case obviously can have no­

19

thing t© do with authorization ©£ the course of conduct in

20

bargaining with the industry over 15 years of this inter­

21

national union and its officers. Obviously the issues msst

22

be centered upon the legal standards applied to this course

23

of conduct and the effects and consequences of this course

24

of conduct over this period of time,

25

And neither the legislative history nor the opinions of
3.0

i

1

this Court support the conclusions and the- construction below

2

with respect to section s:tas0

O

The trial court found a BMW/3C0A implicit agreement

4

violating anti-trust policy on a preponderance- of evidence

5

and we say this finding should have resulted in judgements for

6

these Plaintiffs*

1

Under question two we deal with the express language ox

8

the national contract on the Protective Wage Clausea Para­

9

graph A set fourth at page li of ou'r main brief» Tills language

10

11

was deaaanded by the coal associations»,
It says that UMW will not enter into, become a party to*

12

or permit any agreement or understanding other than national

13

contract terms for the duration of the national contracts

14

Mow the trial court went along with 'MWs rather round»,

15

about argument to restrict this restraint to the 82% of the

16

industry that had signed up under the national contractt. And

17

the court held that made it valid since the 18% that was not

18

organised was not indued in the restraint*

19

Mow w® are contending tu&u »uwa a restraint as this, ©sen

20

if limited to the 32% of the industry* including southern

21

Tennessee? meant that hundreds of companies would be wiped out»

22

During the duration of the national contract without any freedom

23

at all -tss? bargain over modified terms, over terms that were

24

practical and workable in the situations that were present or

25

that might develop during the life of the contract, and that
12

I

this meant a deprivation of bargaining freedom for the duration

2

of the national contract which was not amended again until 1964,.

3

at the end of the damage period of this ©o«e and we say it

4

still goes on today.. But this means a deprivation of bargaining

5

freedom for'great segments of the coal industry.

6

Companies were induced to sign

national contracts for
.

7

all sorts of reasons - mostly violence. But by economic pressure

0

of sorts,,, also. And we say it is a rule of law that will sot

9

work - to say that the 'dominant companies can direct the union

10

to keep all these companies under a contract tinder impractical

n

teraso The violence and the warfare of southern Tennessee is

12

just an ©sample of the efforts of people to stay alive and

13

maintain their only way of living in the face Of such a rule.

14

And this struggle that is going on in

(inaudible) coal

15

fields as is;- ssiown by the many reported federal cases dealing

16

wit'n violence in this union in the period of 1859 and the 1960*s„

17

•*«*£ the"

18

repressed competition, rising coal prices, set by an oligopoly

19

of

tz ecuid bfc predicted - they*re obvious today,

big energy companies.

20

UMW in its reply brief jisr# says no restraint at all was

21

pat on BMW in this Paragraph A. It says now that the whole mean-

22

ing of Paragraph A is included within the last claose of the

23

last sentence of that paragraph,, dealing with tJHWs obligation

24

t© enforce the contract against all sigaators. It says sow that

25

all the presiding language that BMW will not enter into, become
13

/

1

a party t©8 or permit assy agreement or understanding other than

2

national contract terms, for the duration of the contract® all

3

that adds nothing to the meaning of the last clause about

4

enforcing the cantract against all signators,

5

How we submit that this present argument will not hold

6

water as above reading of the clause demonstrates® to say

7

nothing of the fact that this language was demanded by the

8

major coal associations, UMWs brief argues that even if this

9

paragraph did impose a restraint

on UM?/s bargaining free­

10

dom® still® UMW had a legal right to a uniform wage seal©

It

throughout' the industry and therefore the paragraph does not

12

express anything other than what UMW had a legal right to do,

13

anyway.

14

We thinfe the answer to that is that even if UMW did have

15

a right to engage in this kind of bargaining with a dominant

16

unit, and shoving the resulting contracts upon all these other

17

units over a period of 15 years, that still it did not have

18

a legal right to bind itself with the major coal associations
k

19
20
21
22

and companies to pursue that policy in the industry.
Clearly this is what UMW has done to the suppression of a
great segment of the coal industry.
Now, the third question is the broadest et the three

23

questions we raise. We assert that there should be a prima

24

facia case of anti-trust violation from the unions course of

25

conduct- and the effects and consequences over this period of
1 4

1

time of that conduct even without the undisputed proof that

2

the coal associations were ranking demands upon VMW to restrain

3

it and its bargaining policy0

4

HOw the lower court decisions emphasize exclusively the

5

right8 so called right of a union to have a uniform wag© scale

6

throughout an industry, and obviously the courts think this

7

means that the union can deal in bona fide bargaining @nly

8

with the dominant units and can carry out this practice of goin?

9

through so called negotiations but never changing a single

10

eomaa in a single contract„ with a single unit of the hundreds

11

of other units over all this'period with all these varying

12

circumstances»

13

14
15

And with the obvious repression of competition that was
going on* like in southern Tennessee*,
few we say that this emphasis on a uniform wage sea&e

16

really gives no right whatsoever* no recognition* no reconcil­

17

iation to rights of the hundreds of other units,, Hot only

18

under anti-trust law, but under national labor'-policy and

19

national employment policy» The lower court decisions sub­

20

ordinate* obviously* the anti-trust law in this c&se0 allowing

21

this iron-bound* unfair uniformity policy to wreak economic

22

devastation over a three county area for'three years to say

23

nothing about the effects nationally» The lower court decisions

24

frustrate the most basis purposes of national labor policy*

25

making it obviously impossible for hundreds of employers to
15

1

deal la any freed?® at all with their employees about teras

a

and conditions where they are situated, making the conflict and

3

turmoil and finally open warfare down in -Tennessee absolutely

4

necessaryo The very things which the national labor statutes

s

were passed to avoid - the conflict, the turmoil»
The lower court decisions ignore completely the National

6
7

Employment Act which Act was passed sis years after the Apex

8

decision» The national Employment Act says that our national

9

employment policy shall be such so as to promote the free

10

enterprise system - the

free competitive enterprise system -

If

and it says that our national employment policy shall be such

12

so as t© promote those conditions which afford maximum am-,

13

ploymento

Vv

Now*

14

,

this policy is obviously frustrated by the lower

IS

court decisions which require that these hundreds of other

16

companies stick to the demands of the UMW/BCOA unit» That they

17

firs great masses of their employees, and substitute heavy

18

machinery, or be destroyed» Go out of business»
Now the Joint Economic Committee of Congress has spoken

19
20

©at strongly in recent years about this very kind of anti­

21

competitive and anti-job rule making policy, but we say that

22

the principal answer to the present reliance upon a so called

23

uniform wage scale throughout an industry is that Paragraph A

24

was

25

on a preponderance of evidence that this was intended to be. .

demanded by the major coal associations and the cosrrt found

16

1

applied8 not Jest to the 82% of the industry but to the loo%

2

of the industry©

3

Now9 vie &on*t think that the multi-employer bargaining

4

rules cut across this case at all© This Court said in Volks­

3

wagen vSo Federal Maritime Commission 390IIS that the kind of

6

multi «-employer bargaining that conforms with national labor

7

policy is free collective bargaining by representatives of

0

the parties own unfettered choice© How we say that that «ill

9

not encompass this px-aetica of binding together, hundreds of

10

units ©f an industry under one national contract an all sorts

ii

of situations* getting them under there mostly by violence*

12

and then allowing the dominant companies to direct the union,

13

NOw keep all these companies under this contract regardless of

14

the practicality of the terms for the duration of cur national

15

Now this is just one way to squeeze competition out of

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Mr. Williams, you may continue,

ARGUMENT BY EDWARD BENNET WILLIAMS ON BEHALF

6

OF UNITED MINE WORKERS OF AMERICA

7

8
9

(RESUMED)
MR. WILLIAMS: Mr. Chidf Justice, amd may it please the
Court, before recess I was saying that the trial judge under­

10

stood clearly what Section Six nuant, and understood clearly

11

what the burden of p^oof was in this case, and I was dboufc to

12

explicate on that by showing, both from evidence extrinsic to

13

the opinion below and intrinsic within the opinion below, we

14

can see that the trial judge knew precisely what the rule of

15

law was with respect to the burden of proof.

16

Within just a number of weeks after this case was tried

17

before the trial judge without a jury, the same trial judge

18

tried a case involving the same issues, .factually and legally,

19

with a jury. That case is reported at 4:15, Febuary second,

20

at page 1192, Tenesee Consolidated Coal Company against the

21

Mine Workers„

22

Q.

23

A.

Four Sixteen, Febuary second, Mr. Justice Black.

24

Q.

I'm sorry about that, in your brief, I'd forgotten.

25

What volume was that?

Did you have a citation of it in your1'brief?
/

23

%

A,

Eleven ninety two. Yes, X did., Mr. Justice Stewart,

z

Wow in that case, there is set out in

8

Struct ions -that Judge Wilson, gave to the jury with respect to

4

Section Six of

.5

of proof in a case of this type and those instructions appear

6

on pages 22-24 in our brief, the brief of the Respondent,.

7

the in-

Norris-La Guardia, with respect to the burden

And there, it is laid out with absolute clarity what the

8

respective burdens of the Plaintiff are. He says there is one

9

isbsue in this case in which the Plaintiffs have the heavier

10

burden of proof than I have just described. That is whether the

11

defendant actually participated in or authorised or ratified

12

actions which violated the Sherman Act. Later he says on every

!3

other issue in the case the Plaintiffs are required merely to

14

preponderate, to show by a preponderance of the evidence that

16

their contentions are correct. He says labor organisations are

16

relieved under the law of liability for damages, or imputation

17

cf guilt, or lawless acts done in labor disputes by officers or

18

agents, unless there is clear proof that the organisation charge1

19

with the responsibility participated

20

or ratified such acts after they became knowledgeable with res­

21

pect to the acts. In other words, the trial judge showed that

22

he understood precisely what the law was,- at that time. Now

23

what

24

in, gave authorization for

do the Petitioners say with respect to -that?
They say in their reply brief to our brief, at-"page 10

that the judge changed his mind with respect to the burden of

Q.

What page are you on, on this---

A.

I'm now on page 10 of the Petitioners' Reply to the

5

Brief of Respondent, Mr, Chief Justice.

6

Q,

Thank

you.

7

A.

They say that he changed his views, and they say

8

that, if the Court please, with, no record reference, and indeed

8

no record support. For if they were right, with respect to the

10

contention that the trial judge had undergone a change of mind,

11

with respect to what the true burden of proof was, I suggest

12

to the Court that this case neither would have been here, nor

13

should it have been here, because.remedy was easily available

14

to the Petitioners to ask for a remand from the Sixth Circuit

IS

of this case back

to the trial court for purposes of

of

And that’s precisely what the Petitioners would have done

19

if the trial jusge had changed his mind with respect to the

20

burden. But indeed they did not do that and indeed they could

21

not do that, because -the transcript of record shows in Tenesae

22

Consolidated v. the United Mine Workwrs, and this Court may take

23

judicial notice of it as a record from the Sixth Circuit Court

24

of Appeals, that the trial judge did not change his mind at all.

25

That in fact, there was no extensive argument to persuade him

25

I

to a different point of view, a&d dt pages 30-54 of that trans­

E

cript of record, the trial judge announced that he would iy.-

r.J

O

struct the jury in all respects on the law as he had found the

4

law in Ramsey.,

5

NOW,-—

6

Q.

Mr. Williams.

7

A.

Yes, Your Honor.

8

Q.

9
10

If

Is it your view that the Section Six standard, what­

ever it is, extends to all elements of the Anti-Trust defense
-*- the Anti-Trust plan?
A.

No. It's my view, if the Court please, that Section

12

Six applies to the issue as to whether the Union is liable for

13

any allegedly innocent acts or agreements. In order for the

14

Union to agree, it is necessary that it act vicariously through

15

its officers or agents,,. Qn every issue of vicarious liability,

16

Norris-La Guardia requires that there be clear proof that the

17

Union either authorised such conduct or that it ratified it

18

after it bacame knowledgeable concerning it.

19

Q.

Now as to your generalization, Mr. Williams, is

20

that any different from corporate activity? I'm not now talking

21

about the burden of proof.

22

A. A

It's no different, Mr. Chief Justice, because Sec­

23

tion Six applies both to employer organizations and labor or­

24

ganizations in labor disputes. Only in labor disputes. And

25

that's our contention here. That there was a charge. It was
26

1

charged that the Union entered into an illicit, clandestine

z

agreement» Now, it would have to do so vicariously through tie

3

acts of its officers or agents and there was no showing, within

4

■the meaning of Section Six, that there was clear proof that

5

any such condict was authorised or ratified»

6

Now, what did the Petitioners do in lieu of the course

7

that I have just suggested, they would have followed, if they

S

were right about what Judge Wilson held on the burden of proof

©

in this case? They went to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals

to

and. they siesed upon a couple of sentences in a fifty-two page

it

opinion, and they tried to convince the Court of Appeall that

12

Judge Wilson had misunderstood the law on burden of pooof»

m

..

. '■

i

Let’s look at a sentence that they have siezed upon as

u

"illustrating'8 so they contend, that Judge Wilson did not under­

IS

stand the appropriate burden» They say Judge Wilson said

16

ing concluded that the Protective Wage Clause does not consti­

17

tute an express commitment on the part of the UMW to the BCOA

18

not to bargain with any other coal operator upon any terms

19

tther than a national contract, this dowa not conclude the issue

20

of whether the UMW did, in fact, though not expressly,. so con­

21

tract» Were this case being tried upon th*s uiPval preponderance,

22

of evidence rule, the Court would conclude -the UMVJ did so Impli­

23

edly agree» However, the standard of proof where a labor union

24

is involved is clear proof as required by Section Six, the

25

standard

from the argument of persuasion. The

27

‘-rial

hav­

«

>

judge was, they9re saying, since a labor union is the defendant,

2

since the contention is that the labor union entered into an
illicit agreement, and since -the union can enter into such an

4

agreement only vicarionsiy, through its agents or officers or

5

members, then of course -the standard of proof is clearc It must

6

be that the Petitioner's must carry the day by a clear standard

7

of proof t-0 show that the Mine Workers Union did in fact ratify

0

or «authorise such conducto

9

Again, they siezed upon some language, did not the clear

10

evidence rule apply, the Court might have reached a different

II

decision on certain issues. The other issue upon which the

12

court might have reached a different conclusion is the issue

13

concerning violence in the coal fields. This Court said in Gibbs

14

against the Mine Workers in 1966, that the clear proof standard

15

applied when there was an effort by a Plaintiff to impute

16

responsibility for violent acts to the parent union, because

17

Section Six applies, so that all of the language of the trial

18

judges

19

tion of Section Six, There isn’t anything in the fifty-two page

20

opinion that As at war with the appropoiate and proper standard

21

of proof as delineated in Section Six of NOrris-La Guardia,

22

is entirely constant with the appropriate interpreta­

'In fact, I suggest to the Court that Judge Wilsons* in­

23

structions in Tennessee Consolidated coal against the Mine .Wor­

24

kers, and in his holding in Ramsey against the Mine Workers

25

fanned out like a beacon in a fpg of confusion, with respect to

2®

!

this issue on burden of proof.

2

Now I said earlier,

3

Q,

Course! „

4

A,

Yes, sir,

5

C, If I understand the argument you're now making, you're

6

implying that the, all eight members of the Court of Appeals

7

misunderstood what the issue was,

8
9
10

A,

I think. Your Honor, that there was a very, very

serious lack of clarity with respect to the positions that were
asserted,

n

0„ In both cases?

12

A,

Yes, sir, X do,

13

Q,

Because

14

the phrase —*

15

A,

as I understand

— opinion, he relys on

And that's why I say, Mr, Justice Stewart, that

16

the trial judges opinion is entirely accurate here. It was

17

entirely accurate in the case of Barn, entirely accurate in the

to

cases immediateljpefo 11 owing, and that demonstrates that ha un­

19

derstood the burden of proof entirely correctly,

20
21

22

i

Q,

‘

He understood it, and you understood' it, but the

Court of Appeals didn't?
A,

Right, I think that's correct. Now let's look at
■S»

23
24
25

the opinion of Judge Wilson in the Court below.
The Petitioners 'made four subsidiary allegations. They
make four subsidiary allegations to proove circumstantially

29
r

1

that there wea an illicit conspiracy» They say, first of all,

2

that the Petitioners insistence upon a national, uniform wage

3

policy began in 1950 and this was the basis for inferring the

4

incipiency of the conspiracy

5

Association., The trial judge found, I quote,

6

this." He found affirmatively, quote, "That is was clear from

7

all the evidence

a

of the Respondent Union began in 1890,” And that it was no basis

9

for an inference that there was an illicit conspiracy began in

to

1950. They say secondly, that.the tranquility and the serenity

11

of collective bargaining in the post-1950period in the coal in­

12

dustry is a basis for infering that there was a conspiratorial

13

relationship between the Respondent union and the Mine Workers

34

when that is juxtaposed
\
\ to the turbulence and turmoil of the

IS

pre-1950 period.

16

with the Bituminous Coal Owners"
No evidence of

that the national uniformity in wage policy

/

And here the trial judge made a finding, I think, that

17

goes to the very heart of the case. He said that the United

18

Mine Workers negotiated the 1950 Coal Wage Agreement with

19

spokesmen for the major coal producers of the nation and then

20

has uniformly sought to impose the same agreement upon all the

21

rest of the industry might reasonably lead to the inference that:

22

the Mine Workers had agreed with the major operators that it

23

would impose the national agreement upon the rest of the indus­

24
25

try, and equally reasonable inferences that the Union was but
following the pattern of industry-wide bargaining established

30

,

1

since prior to the turn of the century

2

the agreement with spokesmen of the major coal producers and

S

was but following its historic policy of national uniformity

4

of labor standards in seeking to impose the national agreement

■5

in electing to negotiate

upon the rest of the industry.

6

Again, they contend that there was predatory pricing in

7

the TVA market on the part of two coal companies in which the

8

respondent union had an interest. A financial interest. The

9

trial judge, in an exhaustive analysis of the pricing history

10

in the TVA market over a period of years, found not only was

11

there no predatory pricing,by the two companies in which the

12

union had an interest, but that at all times the two companies

13

were merely attempting to meet competition rather than to lead

!

14
15

market downward.
On each of these subsidiary issues, the trial judge was

16

applying the preponderance of the evidence standard and he was

17

finding that the Plaintiffs below had failed to satisfy this

18

standard of proof.

19

Finally, if the Court please, there was a charge that

20

there was turbulence and turmoil in the southeastern Tennessee

21

coal fields during the relevant period, that there was violence

22

and that this was describabie to the mine workers. In this in­

23

stance, once again, the trial judge made this finding. I?e said

24

tliat the United I-iine Workers activities in recent years in the

25

southeastern Tennessee coal field can be explained equally as

31

1

well as being unilateral action in pursuing its own interests

2

and policies as .they can be explained by infering that the

3

UMW was acting in furtherance of a conspiracy * With respect to

4

the issue of violence,, it was the same violence that was averred

3

before this Court in Gibbs against the Mine Workers in 1966,

C

and he implied the standard of proof mandated by this Court in

1

that case and he found that there was no evidence whatsoever

8

to support an inference that the Respondent union was respon­

9

sible for it, and in that instance the clear proof standard

10

applied .

1.1

Q=

Mr. Williams, when the trial judge hinted, for want

12

of a better worg, that if he'd been applying a conventional

13

preponderance rule that he might have arrived at some different

14

conclusions, what area do you say he was directing
A.

15

himself to?

1 think that there were two issues, clearly, Mr.

16

Chief Justice, in which the clear standard of proof applied.

17

One issue was whether or not the mine workers union was re­

18

sponsible for violence which was averred in 1960 and in 1962

19

in the southeastern Tennessee coal fields. The trial judge said

20

that the clear standard of proof applies here because the doc¥

trine of respondeat superior is applicable. And where the don-

21

22

trine of respondeat superior is applicable, then I have to ap­

23

ply a standard of clear proof. He

24

please, that if, at one point, you were deciding whether tine

25

Onion was responsible for any agreement that might have been

'

32

also.said, if the Court

1

made, although he never found that such an agreement was made,

z

if he were to decide that the Union was responsible for any il­

3

licit anti-trust agreement made with the BCGA he would have to

4

apply the clear standard of proofBecause once again, the

5

doctrine of respondeat superior would be appleiable. And where

6

that is applicable, before a Union or an employer can be held

7

in a labor dispute. Congress has mandated under Section Six

8

that clear proof is necessary on that issue»

S

So there were two issues clearly before us where that

10

doctrine was applicable, and I suggest that he found that en­

n

tirely properly, Arid on all other issues he applied the appro­

tz

priate standard, namely the preponderance of the evidence
'i

ts

standard. And an analysis of his findings, beginning at, I

14

believe, pages 141,.Jim sorry, pages 149-l58a of Volume One. of

15

the record which is his opinion, and-which is the overview of

16

all the facts shows that he clearly understood what the burdens

17

were.
Now the Petitioners criticise us and chastise us for

18

m

departmentalizing and dismembering and fragmenting and

20

this opinion, saying you have to take the overview. You have

21

to look at the whole panorama of facts. This is what the trial

22

judge said on that. There remains to be accomplished an evalua­

23

tion of the full record upon the trial of this case. When viewed

24

as a whole, rather than when viewed in segments, as has thus-

25

far been necessary. Having taken a look at the individual figures
33
i

1

one by one,, it's now the duty of the Court to look at the pan­

2

orama» And this is what he says, as he looks at the panorama»

3

While many inferences favorable to the Plaintiffs contentions

4

can reasonably be drawn from the evidence, in every instance

3

a no less equally reasonable inference can be drawn to the con­

6

trary» In other words, at best, be found the evidence

7

which does not even satisfy the preponderance of the evidence

8

standard»

9

So I suggest, if the Court please fchet the judgement of

10

the trial judge was reached entirely in accordance with the

1.1

appropriate standards of proof and that it should be affirmed*

12

for that reason.

FURTHER ARGUMENT BY JOHN A. ROWWTREE, ESQ»

17

ON BEHALF OF UNITED MINE WORKERS

18

Counsel says that the Court gave a complete overview at

19

the end of this case, however, he pronounced the Continental

20

Ore rule about having to judge the whole case as a complete

21

picture, but he did proceed again to dismember the whole case»

22

And in this dismemberment and the overview, be never looked at

23

this provective wage clause again» And you can’t interpret tiis

24

protective wage clause, particularly paragraph & without looking

25

at the whole picture of this case»
34

1

We ask the Court to read it. Paragraph A particularly.

2

I think it’s stretching construction beyond reason to held

3

that it's limited to the 82% of -the industry. In the first

4

place, and we say that even if it is confined to the 82% of

0

the industry, still* it is going to mean, inevitably that

6

hundreds of companies are going to be deprived of any right to

7

sueVive in this industry.

9

Qe

Nov/, no one has to belong to the employer union.

10

A.

No, sir.

11

Q.

Well, anyone who doesn't want to sign the agreement

12

that's negotiated for the union doesn't need to be a member of

13

the union.

14

A.

Shat"s correct, Your Honor, and you could belong to

13

BCOA or not. Take the Illinois Cooperatives Association. One

16

of the three largest associations. They sought freedom from

12

BCOA, according to this record, for many years, and finally

18

went into it.

‘19

20

21

Q.

How many cases have been tried in which the Union

has been sued for damages of a positive action like this?
A.

Your Honor, I think it’s about five cases. Now the

22

first two were first Pennington. We brought that here. Then

23

there was the second Pennington, where we lost without a jury.

24

And clearly that court applied this clear proof rule all the

25

way to pr@ovi.ng predatory intent.
35

?

Q„

1 say, has any judge construed 'the protective wage

2

clause as itself showing an. agreement between the union and the

3

unit to impose these, wage standards on outside--

A.

The two judges who considered it were Judge Taylor

S

in second Pennington» He held we had to proove predatory intent

6

by clear prooff to win» And the second judge was Judge Wilson

in tills case-. And that’s all. Now two juries have held to the

8

contrary. That the protective wage clause was intended to be

9

applied to the total Indus try as obviously it was. And this

10

was a restraint of the economic freedom of the whole industry.

11

This clause says that union will not make any change in any of

12

these units. That8 it's got the contract-—

13

Q.

Is it your position that if the protective wage

14

clause is construed to require the union to impose the wage

13

standards on outsiders that the Plaintiff has made out a viola­

16

tion of the Anti-Trust Laws or only that the unions' exemption

17

is forfeited?

m

A.

We say that is should be a per se violation, Your

19

Honor. Regaldless of purpose or effect, as Your Honor said in

20

Pennington. This must be a per se violation. The employer -has

21

got no right to tell the Union what it can do—-

22

Q.

23

A.

I beg your pardon?

24

Q.

Pennington didn't deal with what a violation of -the

25

!

—violations of the Anti-Trust lav/s, was.

Anti-Trust law was, did it? It just dealt'with when the exemption
36

I

1

applied?

z

A„

Your Honor says that such an agreement, that is,

3

an agreement to apply a certain wage terms in other units,

4

violates anti-trust policy"regardless of purpose or effecto

5

And we say that should be the law. It has got to be the law.

6

The dominant units can’t tell the Union how to conduct itself

?

in these other bargaining units. And we say-—

10

Q.

This is interesting, you may complete your

argument.
A.

That the law cannot.allow the dominant unit to keep

u

all the other bargaining units under the same terms for the

12

duration of the understanding between the dominant unit and the

13

Union. In other words, this national contract, still goes on

14

today. And if the other units can't change therr terms, during

15

the continuation of the national contract, we never will have

16

any competition in this Indusrry. It's practically gone today.
