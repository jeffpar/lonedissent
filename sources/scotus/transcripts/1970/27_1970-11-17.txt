may it. please the Court: I am a counsel for the Appellants in

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

gQGepients

who seek to divorce their husbands in the courts of

Connecticut, but could not afford to pay the court costs imposed
by the State of Connecticut, of roughly $60.
They further allege that the Connecticut Court
officials had refused to waive those costs.

Appellants sought

an injunction on the basis that the fee statute was unconstitu­
tional, requested the District Court to order the Connecticut
Courts to accept Appellants’ divorce papers for filing and to
arrange service of process.
Q

When were these papers originally filed?

approximately?
A

At the end of March in 1968, Your Honor.

Q

From March of '68 until now I suppose we must
2

1

assume they have not been able to accumulate $S0?

2

A

That is correct with at least five of then,

3

Your Honor»

4

participation in this proceeding has been withdrawn.

5

As to two of the original nine plaintiffs, their

Before appearing here today I asked one of the

6

people attached ofco the Neighborhood Office where 1 was

7

formerly employed, to check with the Appellants to make certain

3

that they are, in fact, still interested in this proceeding.

9

Because of the shortage of time, only four of the remaining

10

seven were contacted.

11

and still, Emphatically, undivorced, and still unable to raise

12

the fees necessary to initiate a divorce proceeding in

13

Connecticut.

14

Q

They are still married, after a fashion

How much of a showing have they made with

IS

respect to their indigency# if you wish to call it that, and

16

second: has any showing been brought up to date from March of

17

1968 until now?

18

A

With response to the first, or in response to

19

the first question, Your Honor, the showing which was submitted

20

to the courts of Connecticut and to the District court, con­

Zl

sisted of affidavits which appear in the appendix in this

22

Court indicating their family situation and income situation

23

and economic responsibilities of the Appellants, and we would

24

argue clearly establishing indigency at that time.

2S

Nov/, we have never had an evidentiary hearing on the
3

1

issue of indigency because this case was resolved in the

£

District Court on the pleadings and for the purpose of this

3

appeal and for the purposes of the District Court* indigency

4

was conceded.

5

At the present time there is nothing before this

6

Cousfcf updating that showing of some two-and-a-half years ago.

7

1 suppose if this Court were to hold in favor of the Appellants

8

a remand would be appropriate and at that time as to any of

9

the Appellants in the case* the state would have an opportunity

10

to challenge their indigency.

11

It is Appellants' contention that the conduct of the

12

Appellees has denied them due process rights,, specifically and

13

particularly with respect to the rights to petition for re­

14

dress of grievances.

15

First Amendmentj is incorporated into the Due Process Clause

16

of the 14th Amendment* as reflected in decisions of this Court

17

such as N.A.C.C.P. versus Button, the United Mine Workers

18

versus Illinois decision; Railway Trainmen versus Virginia.

This is a right which appears in the

The right to petition* as this Court has recognized*

20

is a fundamental right.

22

sue and defend in the courts is the alternative of force.

M

rights.

2S

As long ago as Chambers versus

In

It lies at the foundations of orderly government.
Since this case was argued last year* two decisions

4

1

of this Court have been rendered, which I feel bear upon the

2

position of the Appellants, at least with respect to their

3

due process argumento

4

Finance and Goldberg versus Kelly»

5

I refer to Sniadach versus Family

Essentially, both of those cases held that before

&

ted by state action, a hearing must be afforded.

B

lants seek that very same hearing and yet their position is

9

more critical than that of the position of the Appellants in

The Appel­

to

Goldberg versus Kelly and in Sniadach, because in this instance,

n

not only have the Appellants been denied a prior hearing, which

was the issue in Sniadach and Goldberg, but they have been

denied any hearing.

They have simply been denied the oppor*®

For this reason Appellants maintain that the rights
to due process have been denied.

Of equal importance, is the

other aspect of our argument which relates to the right to
equal protection as guaranteed by the 14th Amendment,to the
/
United States Constitution,
As long ago as 1941 Mr, Justice Jackson wrote, in
Edwards versus California;
funds is a neutral fact,
race, creed or color,"

"The mere state of being without
Constitutionally an irrelevance, like

More recent decisions of this court

have indicated that poverty, likewise is a suspect criterion
and when a state discriminates among its citizens upon the

5

1

basis of poverty that it must make the same showing to justify

2

that discrimination as would be required if the discrimination

3

were racial»

4

Q

Mr. LaFrance, let me follow through a little

5

bit on your, equal protection argument.

6

wanting a divorce, your clients wanted to get married, and

7

the marriage license were $3.

8

tection demands that they be given the marriage license with­

9

out payment of a fee?

10

A

Suppose, instead of

Would you say that equal pro­

I would, Your Honor, if the demonstration were ■

fi

made that in point of fact they could not afford that fee.

U

the reason is simply this;

n

may not affect a matter of constitutional import, this court

14

has said that marriage and procreation are basic civil liber­

15

ties of man and I refer to Loving versus Virginia; Skinner

16

versus Oklahoma and Griswold versus Connecticut.

11
18
19
20
21

22
23

And

although a dog license, for example,

And sc the Appellants8 position would, be that
whenever a fee is attached to a state franchise of activity
which is of constitutional magnitude; then that fee must be
raised on behalf of an indigent.
Q

Wall, then you draw no distinction between the

need for a divorce and the desire to marry?

h

That is, within limitations, correct.

We are

24

primarily concerned with — particularly concerned about di­

25

vorces in this case because it carries with it the right to

6

1

marryf or remarry, I should say? the right to procreate with

2

someone other than the present spouse so that in the context

3

of this case, divorce and remarriage are very closely linked.

4
S

Q

And does your record show in any that remar­

riage was contemplated by the parties , or any of them?

6

A

No, it does not, Your Honor.

I believe the

1

structure of Connecticut and of most states is such tthat

8

divorce carries with it the right, to remarry.
Q

3

Then let me ask the next question which you in­

10

dicated:

fl

fishing license or a dog license?

can you carry your Equal Protection Clause to a

12

A

No, I would not.

13

Q

And you draw the line then where?

14

A

I draw the line with respect to constitutionality

IS

protected interests.

For

16

simply about divorce; we're here talkina about the right to

have access to-the courts.

The First Amendment speaks'* about this specifically.

19

It says nothing about fishing licenses or dog licenses.

20

asked me a moment ago about marriage.

21

that marriage is a basic civil liberty.

22

as a given and accepting it, then I would argue further that

23

conditioning a basic civil liberty on the ability to pay for

2A

it is an impermissible state regulation of constitutional

25

rights

7

You

This Court has said
Taking that statement

1

Q

And you wouldn't put the right to fish in that

2

lake of Connecticut,, as a civil liberty right, if there are any

3

lakes in Connecticut with fish left in them?

4

A

There are some,,

I would say that it is a

5

right»

Q

the distinction, let us say, between Shapiro versus Thompson

7

on the one hand and Williams versus Dandridge on the other»

3

In Williams versus Dandridge maximum grants were

9

I suppose the distinction which becomes important is

upheld in welfare cases by this Court»

In Shapiro versus

10

Thompson, in welfare cases .residency restrictions were stricken

11

down»

12

interests in both cases, but that the right in Shapiro versus

13

Thompson was deemed to be a constitutional rights the right of

14

free travel in the United States, whereas in Williams versus

15

Dandridge the majority of this Court concluded that although

16

there were interests being affected by the state’s economic

17

regulation, they ware not of constitutional dimension and as

IS

a consequence, the showing by the state of''a reasonable pur­

19

pose for regulation, was sufficient to justify maximum grants»

20

I don’t know if this is responsive,

21

tinction which I would draw, for example, between access to

22

the courts and a fishing license»

23

The

difference was not that there wefeen’t rights or

Q

but it would be the dis­

Mr» LaFrance, what do you do about the man who

24

wants to sue to prevent pollution of the air by the electric

25

company in New Haven?

Would he have to pay fees?

8

1

A

Not if ha is indigent, Your Honor»

2

Q

Well, you want the sane indigent protection

3

you have in criminal prosecutions»

4

in this case?
A

5

I don't believe so.

Do you really go that far

We at least want the same

protection that is afforded in criminal cases as to the oppor­

6

tunity for a hearing»

7

We would not go beyond that and maintain

that the criminal protections, for example, 1involving appoin­

8

ted counsel, are necessary in civil cases»

9

And there are a

number of distinctions which are relevant,

10

■ For example —

11

Q

12

Well, suppose the person files on air pollution

and some legal aid society takes over the lawyer part? he

13

doesn’t pay fees and then he wants to appeal»

14

Who takes care

of that?

15

A

16

question.

17

X ®m sorry, Your Honor, I didn't understand the

With respect to the appeal who would take care of

the costs?

18

If the state could make a showing that the costs

19

were necessary to maintain the appellate system, then I suppose

20

as a matter of equal protection that itcould require appellate

2!

costs of an indigent»

22

Q

23

I honestly don’t know of any system where the

court costs take care of the court.
M
they always need that money.

25

S
1

They never do»

I mean

1

A

I agree and one of the positions which the

2

Appellants have maintained in their brief is that the justifi­

3

cation offered by the state for imposing costs on indigents

4

simply is inadequate for the burden that results.

5

in terms of producing revenues, it doesn’t make sense to re­

6

quire that revenues be generated by the poor who simply are

7

unable to produce them.

8

Q

9

For example,

You would make much more sense with me if you

could draw a line other than saying that in all civil actions

10

the person, without income can. file without payment of fees,

11

which is a pretty broad hump of litigation.
A

12

And yet, Your Honor, in roughly half of the

13

states, the very same type of informa, pauperis 'litigation

14

which we are arguing here today is provided as a matter of

15

statute and yet those states by their court systems don11 seem

16

to be crumbling under the burden.

17

Q

To — draw up a contract?

10

A

I have not surveyed the exact dimensions but

19

of these provisions but at least as to some of the states the

20

door is that wide open.

21

an action.

That is, an indigent may simply file

22

Q

Without the payment of any fees at all?

23

A

Yes, Your Honor.

24

Q

Suppose he wins?

23

Suppose he sued for a million

dollars and gets a million dollars; can the state get its $20
10

!

filing fee that way?

2

A

I would think that it. could do that.

3

Q

I would hope so.

4

Q

While we have you interrupted, counsel, you

5

spoke in terns of a right that comes by way of franchise.

6

Would you say that a man who seeks a license to practice to

7

carry on the business of being a barber or an electrician or

8

a plumber, one of the licensed activities, that had a substan-

9

tial license fee of a sum due up to $100 or more.

to

same category as your client here?

11

12

Is he in the

A

I don’t, think that h6 is, Your Honor.

New, as

a matter of equal protection —

13

Q

Well, isn't there an inherent right, a con-

14

stitutional right to engage in an occupation if you can pay the

15

fee?

16

A

There certainly is that, but there may also be

17

a right on the part of the state legitimately to regulate cer­

m

tain types of activities and there may also be a right on the

19

part of the state to impose licensing fees, examination fees

20

and investigation fees and the like ..by I8ra thinking specifically

21

now of the $200 I am going to have to repay to the Arizona Bar

22

Association within the next few months, but the situation here

23

is dramatically different because these Appellants are seeking

24

to exercise a right which is specifically protected by the

25

constitution, which has body in the First Amendment.

11

The right

1

of a plumber, I suppose,, is assured by the Equal Protection

2

Clause and the Due Process Clauses against arbitrary or

3

capri ious discrimination, but the right of the person to go

4

into court is as fundamental as a right of a person to vote or

5

the right of a person to exercise free speech or engage in

6

political activity .

7

And as to these, before the state can impair these

8

rights it must demonstrate 3 compelling necessity for the

9

regulation v?hich it seeks to impose»

10

Q

Well, does not the state in its capacity of

11

parens patriae, if not on broader grounds, have a deep inter­

12

est in regulating the termination of the marriage state?

13

A

It certainly does that, Your Honor, but in this

14

instance the regulation involved, imposing a fee upon indigents

15

does not —

IS

Q

I know* but it5s imposed on everyone; isn't, it?

17

A

Yes, but the only aspect of the fee system .

13

which is being challenged here today is that which operates

19

against indigents and bars them from the courts»

20

tion which is involved in not particularly well-calculated to

21

save the family, since it applies to all types of litigation.

22

The regula­

In addition, of course, the courts of Connecticut

23

have spoken with respect to divorce.

24

divorce is permissible? is authorized as a matter of state

25

policy, if grounds are shown; and yet the state has gone farther
12

They have said that

1

and said,, "We don’t mean this with respect to the poor,

2

because as to them we attach a further condition; the condi­

3

tion that they cannot get a divorce unless they somehow abro­

4

gate their condition of poverty.

5

The Court of Appeals for the D. C« Circuit in Parks

<S

versus Parks, cited in out' last brief which we filed with this

7

Court, noted that if, in the District of Columbia, in addition

3

to the requirements which Congress has imposed for obtaining a

9

divorce, if there were a further requirement that only the

10

wealthy or the affluent could obtain divorces, then there would

11

be issues of serious constitutional dimension raised and I sub­

12

mit that this isihe case which is contemplated by that court.

13

Q

That hypothetical really isn’t worth very much

14

because there is no state in the country that has ever had any

15

such statute.

16

A

Except that the effect —

17

Q

Negatively; the negative impact is what you are

18

talking about?

19

A

Yes, I am, Your Honor.

20

Q

Suppose we agreed with you, and decided the

21

case thb way you want it decided and a week afterward someone

22

comes in and wants to go to court and they say, "I have plenty

23

of money; if you don’t let me file my action without the pay­

24

ment of the fee, you are denying me equal protection as compared

25

with Gladys Boddie and the other people involved here?

13

A

1

I suppose that if that, person would like to

2

change places with life with Gladys Boddie, she would be very

3

happy to meet them and change places with them»

4

that entirely facetiously, because I don't believe there is an

S

obligation upon the state to equalize all of the inequities of

6

life, but what we do contend here is that the state, when it

7

creates a right or in this instance, when it forces a person to

8

come to it to resolve that person's affairs, cannot create

9

new inequities? cannot inpose requirements which, I suppose

10

I don't mean

life itself, does not impose,
What we have here is a situation like that in

11
12

Williams versus Illinois, decided in June of this past year

13

where a person who would not pay a fine was required to work

14

it off in the State of Illinois and this court said that on its

IS

face that’s a perfectly reasonable, equitable statute except

16

that in operation for the poor it makes an invidious discrimina­

17

tion .
Now, I suppose that a prsioner in Illinois might

18
1©

appear some day before this Court and make the same argument

20

that could be made with respect to both Gladys Boddie? that is

Zi

that the indigent are receiving preferential treatment,

22

crux of this case is not that? it is simply that the state

23

cannot discriminate against the poor, in structuring its legal

24

system.

25

But the

With respect to the due process and equal protection
14

1

arguments, which Appellants have submitted to this Court, I

2

suspect that the comments I have made by this time are"at

3

least a survey of our position.

4

There is one other aspect of our position which I

S

would like to turn to and that is the arguments -- that is

6

with reference to the arguments which the state has put forward

7

to justify its fee system.

8

frivolous litigation or if it does, it does so only with res­

8

pect to the poor and as to them, it deters all litigation.

The fee system does not deter

It

10

does not provide revenues, at least not from the poor, because

11

they are unable to pay these fees.
It does not particularly, or at least measur

12

/,

13

conserve revenues or facilities or services in the court

14

system.

15

to my knowledge that the cost of constitutionally imposed bur­

16

dens relieves the states from fulfilling their duties under

17

those burdens.

IS­

And even if it did, it has never been held or believed

In Shapiro versus Thompson this Court said that, "We

IS

recognise that a state has a valid interest Jn preserving the

20

fiscal integrity of its programs.

21

plish such a purpose by invidious discrimination between

22

classes of its citizens.

23

its expenditures for schools by barring indigent children, and

24

yet the State of Connecticut is attempting to reduce its ex­

2S

penditure for courts by barrinof indigent litigants.

But a state may not accom­

Xt could-not, for example, reduce

15

1

We wish to emphasise that it is not enough for the

2

Appellees to show a mere rational basis for the fee system

3

which operates in the State of Connecticut»

4

more a compelling necessity for imposing court fees upon the

5

poor .

6

They must show

This Court,, in Shapiro versus Thompson, which 1

7

just quoted from, said in essence, that only a compelling

&

necessity could justify discriminating among citizens on sus­

3

pect criteria, such as poverty or race, and discriminating in

10

a manner which affects important rights, such as the petition

11

for redress of grievances„

12

We ask this Court to reverse the Court below? to

13

give the relief which Appellants seek and in so doing we have

14

maintained in the last brief, which we submitted to this Court,

15

that a holding in favor of Appellants can be narrowly based;

16

or narrowly limited in its implications.
•. f

17

This case involves a specific constitutional

18

guarantee: the right to petition for redress of grievances»

19

It involves litigation concerning matters of constitutional

2.0

magnitude: marriage, procreation.

2!

which cannot be settled privately.

22

Further, it involves matters

The State of Connecticut has said to these

23

Appellants -that they cannot resolve their affairs privately;

24

they must go into state courts to seek the relief they need

as

and yet at the same time have barred them from those courts.
16

A holding emphasising these factors, for example,

?

2

would not compel a later holding that counsel must be appoin­

3

ted in civil cases or a later holding that fees for the use of

4

golf greens on a public golf course must be waived for the

5

poor.

8

A useful analog for this case is Goldberg versus

7

Kelly, where this Court considered the meaning of due process

3

in welfare termination cases , and concluded that a hearing is

3

the essence of due process, but that appointment of counsel

10

11
12

13
14
15
18

17
18

may not be required.
In conclusion, then, we ask this Court to grant the
relief for Appellants —
Q
you draw there.

I don’t quite get that brief.

The distinction

Maybe the party is so indigent that they can’t

hire a lawyer,
A

That is correct, Your Honor and I would

suppose that tin many, if not most aspects of civil litigation
it would be useful, perhap-s necessary, to have an attorney, but

19

a holding in this case would not compel a later holding that

20

counsel must be appointed in civil cases,

21

22
23
24
as

Q

Why would it not?

A

Because in this case we are relying upon a

specific First Amendment guarantee and the right to petition
for redress of grievances.
Q

There is no such —

They might be barred from it as successfully

17

1

by not being able to hire a lawyer, as by not being able to pay

2

Perhaps as a matter of equal protection under

called a court, but that the functions of courts must be per-

that the courts must be open to all to prosecute or defend theis

and that there may now be publicly-supported agencies within

8

the State of Connecticut who would supply the $45.

9

A

There may well be.

10

Q

That line of questioning was pursued, I think

11

by all of us with respect to the basic proposition that Mr.

12

Justice Black suggested to you that if there is any other

13

solution you do not reach the large constitutional issues.

14

A

Well, if the factual situation — I have to

15

admit this; if the factual situation which exists today had

IS

existed when we filed a motion to dismiss, we wouldn’t have

17

filed a motion to dismiss.

18
19
20
21

Whan we filed a motion to dismiss, we had a lot of
cases from this New Haven Legal Assistance Association -Q

Mr. Attorney General, as of right now dees Mrs.

Boddi© or anybody else have the $45?

22

A

1 couldn’t answer that —

23

Q

Well, do you "deny it?

24

25

.Do you deny that she is

unable to put up the $45?
A

She personally, I would concede that she is
35

1

probably unable to put up the $45.

2
3

Q

In the case we have now she is in the sane

position she was then.

4

A

That is correct.

The welfare department does

j'

5

not give welfare'recipients

6

7

Q

direct money for court proceedings

Well, does anybody else give them the $45 to

file this action?

8

A

It's my understanding they do, Your Honor.

9

Q

Wall, can you prove it?

11

A

X can prove it now, but it’s not in -the record.

12

Q

Can you prove that Mrs. Boddie has got $45?

13

A

Not applied to the individual? no. Your Honor.

14

Q

Well, that!s what we are dealing with, these

15

five people.

16

A

10

17

Or is that just

hearsay?

I can just shot? an expenditure of sums for fees

and costs.

18

Q

Well, we8re dealing with five named Appellants.

19

Q

Well, would you be willing to represent to the

20

Court that if this case were remanded to the courts of Connecti­

21

cut, that there may well be facilities to provide her with

22

money that was not available when this action was started?

23

Could you represent that?

24
25

A

Yes, I think X would.

I have got a certified'

order that the New Haven Legal Assistance; and it shows an
36

expenditure of several dollars? of $6/000 for fees and costs
in litigation.
Q

In divorce cases?

A

In all kinds of cases, Your Honor.

Q

Does it say divorces?

A

No? it8s not broken down that --

Q

You mean pay in all cases in litigation?

A

Excuse me, Your Honor please?

it's not broken down

It’s all cases.

this audit is .not broken down by —

they have got "transports and costs'/’ total: $6*000»
Q

What?

"" '<v.~~

A

$6,000 plus.

Q

For what?

A

Transports and costs.

Q

What kind of cases?

A

Well, there's no criminal'fees here.

Criminal, civil or
We have a

public defender system in Connecticut in criminal •—
Q

Does this budget cover all civil matters, the

one you are reading from?
A

Xt8s not necessarily restricted to civil cases, j

Q

But it includes them?

A

It includes them.

And it indicates a surplus

on hand at the end of the season.
,MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: I think your time is up,
Mr. Cannon

1

MR» CANNON:

2

MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

3

I think so* Your Honor»
Your time is ap3 too,

Counsel, but I have a question or two to put to you,

4

MR» LA FRANCE:

5

MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you»
You have heard this

S

colloquy, of course and I am sure that you as a member of the

7

Bar, you would know that this Court doesn't reach constitutional

8

issues if there is any way t© avoid them»

9

Bo you see any reason why this case should not be

10

remanded to the Courts of Connecticut for consideration in

11

light of the changed conditions which may have occurred and

12

which are suggested to have occurred, by way of providing means

13

for this $45 entry fee?

14

A

I certainly do»

15

Q

What are they?

16

A

First,, I would argue that the availability of

There are several reasons»

17

other sources is irrelevant t© whether or not these Appellants

18

have a constitutional right to walk into a court of Connecticut

19

and file a proceeding without having t© pay for sanctions, for

20

fees which that state court has imposed upon them»

21
22

Q

Even if the State of Connecticut, through its

agencies will provide that $45 on request?

23

A

24

Now, secondly, with respect to that, the record in

25

Yes»

this case is clear that the State of Connecticut will not
38

1

provide those funds on request.
I must say that I personally resent that a member

1
3

of the Bar of this Court and as an Attorney * Mr. Cannon0s

4

going outside of the record ~
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

5

6

We asked him to go

outside ©f the.record. Counsel.
MR. LR FRANCE;

7

In the fashion in which he did,

8

because'; for example, there is no program in the State of

3

Connecticut which will provide court fees to indigent litigants

10

1?
12

upon request.

Connecticut is at all involved, and that is a pilot program
serving a small section of

EO
21

22
23

24
25

Middletown and the county around it.

For the rest of the state, and 1 might add, for the

13
14

There is only one program in which the State of

restof the Nation, people going to Legal Services Programs
cannot get into court unless that program is fortunate imough
to have excess funds or a budget item which allows for payment
of fees.
New Haven Legal Assistance is one of the few pro­
grams in the country, to ray knowledge, which, over the years,
has had some funds available for payment of court fees.

They

are limited funds; they are insufficient, but more importantly
if a person has a constitutional right to walk into a court he
should not have to go begging or soliciting or his attorney
should not have to go soliciting to charitable or voluntary
ad hoc agencies or governmental programs for something which
39

1

the State of Connecticut is obligated to provide.

2

Now, X submit to this Court —

3

Q

That80 the issue before us? isn't it?

4

A

Pardon?

5

Q

That's the issue before us? isn't it?

6

Whether the state

7

A

That is correct.

8

Q

Whether they are obligated to do it without

A

And so that I maintain that Mr, Cannon's

9
10

money,

11

argument, or at least the burden of it missed the point of this

12

appeal, which is that these Appellants don't have to go to

13

charitable organisations which may or may not have funds to

14

get something which the state is obligated to provide.

15

Now, to go back to the point which Mr, Cannon, I

16

guess was arguing: New Haven Legal Assistance does not have the

17

funds for these Appellants,

18

started this case? I wouldn't be here today.

If they did, 1 would never have

Your Honor, these cases —

have the money to pay the fee out ©f that fund?
A

The State of Connecticut has no fund.
