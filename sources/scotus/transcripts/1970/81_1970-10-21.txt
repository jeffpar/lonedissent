In a three-bedroom house, in the northeast bedroom of the

in the house were charged with the crime of possession of

There was a storage room which was searched

immediately joining the house.

There was a kitchen, a living

Q

-- six or seven roomsthere.

17

A

Including the bathroom -- as near as we could

18

determine, there were nine police officers involved in this

19

particular case.

20

At the motion to suppress, which was argued on

21

January 12, in the U.S. District Court in Phoenix, Arizona, we

22

specifically objected to the admissibility of the evidence on

23

the grounds that it was a search that went far beyond the dic­

24

tates of Harris and Rabinowitz.

25

was a mere .pretext, and

We also argued that the search

in fact our whole motion to suppress

?

z

was based upon this premise.
Again* when we appealed the conviction to the Ninth

3

Circuit, we again specifically alluded to the fact of the

4

pretext and the fact that it was our feeling that the search

5

violated Rabinovatz and Harris.

S

When the Chirnel case came out,

the Ninth Circuit

7

specifically requested further memoranda with reference to the

8

retroactivity of Chirnel* and after malting that finding they

9

specifically found that the search involved did violate Chime!;

10

however* they said it was not. retroactive and therefore they

!1

affirmed the conviction of the defendant and we came up here

IZ

on certiorari and here is why we are here.

13

The first issue 1 would like to present to the Court

14

on retroactivity,

IS

where if Mr, Williams --if Mr. Chimel had not been so fortu­

16

nate as to arrive here before the Supreme Court of the United

17

States before us, we might very well be here today arguing the

18

same matters that were argued in front of the Court by Chimel

19

and very well have a ruling consistent with Chimel that this

20

was an illegal search and seizure.

21

to give retroactivity to this particular case on a direct

po

appeal from a federal court* we are creating an inequity in

23

ch-^ law iti that we are differentiating between merely because a

24

man has not been as fast as someone else in coming up here to

25

the Supreme Court of the United States.

SsaC if

it would seem to be that we have a situation

And in effect, by refusing

It is felt that all the eases in which -- and this is

2

what the Supreme Court has heard many times -- in which all the

43

cases in which strictly a prospective application has been

4

made, our ease is of new law, new areas.

5

that in this particular case -» and Chime1 is not a new area

6

in that it just in effect advises law enforcement authorities

7

of what is reasonable, what is a reasonable search incidental

8

to an arrest.

8

And again we submit

Harris came out and then the Court later on,

in

10

Trupiano, specifically overruled Harris and again specifically

!1

held that the search incidental to an arrest should be strictly

12

construed.

13

specifically holds that Rabinowitz is to be considered on its

14

facts,

15

by all the facts and circumstances arriving at that particular

16

situation.

17

situations in this particular case were such that the fact

ARGUMENT OF JAMES VAN R. SPRINGER,

23

Thank you, Mr. Florence.

ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

24

MR. SPRINGER:

25

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court, as I indicated at the outset of my argument in the last
9
ii
/

1

case,,

2

quite simply that the conviction should be affirmed because

3

the evidence in question was obtained by a search that was

4

legal under the law at the time ©f the search, before Chimel

5

was decided„ and Chimel should not be applied retroactively so

6

as to illegitimize that search, and we don't argue here, as

7

we did in Elleanieh, that there was any special combination of

8

exigent circumstances that would now justify this search with­

9

out a warrant.

our position in the present case, the Williams case,

is

SO

At the outset, I think we can fairly easily dispose

11

of the petitioner's argument that the Court need not reach the

12

retroactivity question in this case -«*

13
14

Q

May I ask; if you if the government is taking a

position that the search warrants are reasonable?

15

h

The search was reasonable under the law in

16

effect at the time of the search and,

17

has —

18
19
20

21

Q

as Mr. Justice Stewart

Forgetting the time and retroactivity,

in which

I have had some interest from time to time, what do you say
about the search of itself?
h

If we were here arguing Chimel, again we would

£2

argue that it was reasonable, Mr. Justice Black.

23

think we do not

24

Q

25

A

This case
we do not concede that
10

However,

I

I

Q

in this case?

2

A

Yes, Mr. Justice -- we do concede, however,

3

that under the principle of Chimel,

4

really justify this earch —
Q

5

if it applies, we cannot

I thought you accepted the principle of Chimel,

3

depending on whether the circumstances showed it to be reason­

7

able?

8

the same way in another where the circumstances are different?

Eow can one case be an express decision for holding

A

3

If I understand the question, Mr. Justice, we

10

do submit that there are circumstances present in Elkanieh

1?

going to reasonableness under posfc-Chimel standards which are

12

simply not there to be argued from in this present Williams

1.3

case, but the circumstances ©f the search are quite different

14

in the two cases.

13

I say, we are not arguing -- we are arguing only retroactivity

16

here —

And in light of the precedent of Chimel, as

17

Q

Does that mean one who believes,

18

indicated in Linkletfcer,

19

this case on his idee, of retroactivity should not be applied

20

or should be applied retroactively?
A

2?

I think,

as I do, as

to the conclusion that he must reverse

certainly, Mr. Justice Black, given

22

the decision in Chimel and giving your views as stated in

23

Linkletfcer,

24

course, we ---

25

this case would have to be reversed.

Q

And,

of

And I understand the government is abandoning
11

I

any attack on the search and agreeing in effect for this case

2

that under the circumstances it was unconstitutional.
A

3
4

Yes, we are, Mr. Justice Black,

that --

and we believe

'

1
Of course, with what the facts are in the Chime3!

5

Q

Q

case itself,

7

wouldn't lead to reversal of this case, would it?

that wouldn't — I mean, given those views,

8

A

■that is certainly true.

9

Q

Let me put it

10

A

If the two cases,

that

if each case had been -- if

11

Linklefcter had been decided the other way,

12

Justice Black,

as you urged,

Mr.

and if Chimel had been decided the other way -~

13

Q

As I also urged.

14

A

-- as you also urged ~~

15

Q

That is on retroactivity?

16

A

Well, in Chimel on the reasonableness of the

18

Q

Oh, yes o

19

A

-- we would be --

29

Q

Let me put it to you

21

A

-- the government would be arguing that this

17

search --

t

22
23

was a trciditional reasonable search.
Q

Let me put it to you in any way, Mr. Springer.

24

If we were today arguing Cbitnel and this case,

25

they would both have the same disposition?
12

do you think

1

A

1 think probably so, without having obviously

2

gone the same depth into the record in Chimel, Mr. Chief

3

Justice*

4

and circumstances.

5

X think the searches are quite similar, both in scope

Q

What you would be arguing, 1 suppose, wo a Id be,

5

if you were up here with Cbimel only, you would be arguing

7

that Chimel ought to be overruled, isn't that the nub of it?

8
9

A

Yes, we would, Mr. Justice Harlan, but we have

frankly not interpreted the grant of certiorari --

10

Q

1*0»

11

A

-- in this case in that light,

12

Q

That is your position, though, really?

13

A

Yes.

14
15

But for the sake of argument hereafter

in this case, 1 think, I am assuming that Chi me 1 is the law.
Q

Well, what I don't understand about that is --

16

1 understood you to tell me in the last case that your position

17

is that the search was not unreasonable? under the circumstances

13

it was not unconstitutional.

19

A

That is certainly so, and if we had --

20

Q

Well, if the circumstances in this case are

21

different to the circumstances in the last case ~~

22

A

Yes, they are «-

<w

Q

Then why would you have to overrule that case

24

to say that the circumstances as far as the facts are con­

25

cerned, to say that here we decide the reasonableness in a

different way?

«g

A

Urn

3

Well, the problem is that the facts of this case

are very much like the Chime! case two years ago —

4

Q

I understand they are very much alike, but fre­

5

quently,

G

make something unreasonable which was about those facts» which

7

would have made it reasonable.

8

9

I would suppose,

A

the slightest deviation in facts might

Wellc we do hot argue that there is such a dif­

ference between the facts of Chime1 and the facts of this case.

10

We are simply not taking that position in the present case,

II

that it is different from Chimel —

12

Q

Then I don5fc understand why you can say you are

13

arguing that each case is to be tested by the reasonableness

14

under the circumstances.

15

A

Yes, but,

on the other hand, Wr. Justice Black,

16

this is a basic principle to the approach that the Court has

17

taken,

18

cases, and their approach that we are here arguing,

IS

are sub-principles of reasonableness that have emerged over the

20

years at various times with reasonable clarity.

O

A

Yes „
It was a search which was aimed at loosing,,

4

again as in the last case, for marked- currency which had been

5

used in the sale on which the arrest was based and was in fact

S

found, and the search for narcotics which a]so was found.

7

it was not a general exploratory search or the kind of mass

8

seizure,

case, decided at the same time as Chimel.

10

h

Mr. Justice Marshall,

though I think the

21

evidence suggests that Mr. Williams was a substantial narcotics

22

dealer, given the right and obligation,

23

forcement officers to provide against contingencies,

24

might well, when they went to his house, have come up against

excessive manpower.

wouldn't they know how many people were in there?

Well,

were looking for him all evening.

am still worried about nine people to arrest one man.
A

Well, I admit that I have no compelling answer

'15

for that, but it is certainly true that he wasn't there when

16

they arrived.

17

He might well have arrived with a car full of confederates,

18

for all that the agents could foresee.

He arrived while they were watching the house.

19

Q

Well, why didn't they arrest him in the street?

20

A

I think the facts suggest, Mr. Justice

21

Marshall — and 1 don't have the exact layout of the house —

22;

as far as I can tell from the record, he drove up the driveway

23

and it was or 1y a matter of the distance perhaps from you to

24

me between the car and the house,, and I think it was not un­

25

reasonable for the officers to wait until he got into the

house, and 1 think they probably couldn't have dona anything

else.

to evaluate what had happened to decide whether this was the

So this case does boil down, 1 think, to a simple

11
12

question whether Chirael should be retroactive as to cases that

13

were on direct appeal, as this case was, when Chime 1 was de­

14

cided.

IS

Court's express decision in the Desist case, which was also a

16

direct appeal case and, therefore, we think that a decision to

17

reverse in this case would have to depend upon an overruling

18

of Desist which,

Of course, we think the situation is governed by the

Q

19

like this case, was a Fourth Amendment case.
Whatever rules ultimately are adopted for this

20

retroactivity problem, you draw no distinction between direct

appeal and collateral review?

No, we do, as the court die not, Mr. Justice

Yes,

In Desist, we stand on Desist as being

majority opinion, reflects appropriately the purpose of a new

Fourth Amendment rule, such as the Kate rule or the Chime!

a number of times, to prevent and not to repair.

said this in the Elkanich decision,, that the purpose of a

Fourth Amendment principle is to deter illegal police behavior

be that the Court intended to

in the least bit illegal or unreasonable at the time they

s
•f'y

Au

by its conclusion that the rational

cutoff point in any search

and seizure case at least for retroactivity purposes is the
I

date of the police activity which the new rule determines to
be illegal,
5
6

I think, upon analysis, this turns out to be the

most rational fairest cutoff point

that could be evolved.

To he sure, it has been suggested that turning down

7

a man whose case was on direct review at the time the new rule '

8

was laid down, is in a sense unfair to him because one man

9

who comes to this Court one day gets relief and a man who

10
11

comes to the Court in the same posture the next day does not.
On the other hand, I don't think; it has been sug­

12

gested that the man who came the day before, as Chime 1 did for

13

example, should be given relief simply because of the fact that

14

he was in this Court at about the same time as Chimel.

15

of course, he is penalized perhaps because his lawyer, if he

16

had one, didn’t draft his petition perhaps as artistically as

17

Chimel did or for some reason or other the Court happened to

13

take a later case rather than an earlier one.

19

And,

Also I think it has to be new recognized that how

20

long a particular case remains pending under direct review

21

is the product, a number of factors which donit necessarily

22

reflect upon fairness, a more affluent defendant or a defendant

23

with a less responsible lawyer may have — or a better or

24

worse lawyer, depending on the circumstances, may have for one

ZS

reason or another kept his case alive on direct review with
24

\

arguments that have nothing to do perhaps with the new rule to !

2

which he becomes the beneficiary just because perhaps his case

,

i

3

had been kept alive on the basis of arguments that might have

4

been plainly frivolous.

5

i

And of course the states of the dockets of the

6

various courts of appeals around the country, again, are fae-

7

fcors which have nothing to do with the fairness of whether one !

8

defendant

9

it seems to us, as it did to the Court in Desist, that the

should be in jail or another one should be out.

So

10

fairest most rational dividing point is the date of the

1J

activity upon which the new rule focuses, and if the new rule

12

focuses upon pretrial investigatory activity, as many of the

13

new rules the Court has considered do, the cutoff date should

14

be the date of the activity that was carried out in reliance

15

on the whole rule.

16

17
18

Q

Your argument too is that the environment of a

man whose particular case is cited?
A

Yes, that does, Mr. Justice Blackroun.

Of

IS

course, I believe, 1 think, that

20

if not the Court have suggested — that any new rule could be

21

made wholly prospective.

22

barrier to doing that though, ai the opinion in Stovall vs.

23

Denno, which considered this, suggested there may be — in fact

24

are jurisprudential reasons for not doing that, but since the

25

problem of simple incentive of lawyers to bring cases raising

and some Justices at least,

There is at least no constitutional

25

1

I

new principles,, the further consideration that the Court has

■2

over the years considered that its decisions are best made

U-a

when they are required and made in terms of the facts of a
4

5

particular record.
I think it is a little harsh and rigid to say that

•8

because the Court has chosen not to make new law in that

7

wholly prospective way, that it must therefore give relief to

8

everybody whose case was on direct review, either in this

9

Court or some other court, at the time of the new decision,

10

because — and as I have suggested -- in terms of the pracfci-

11

ealities and in terms of the hundreds or thousands of

12

defendants who are in prison around the country, that is not a

fi jvJ/

very fair or, I would submit, rational dividing line.

.

14

I might just say a word about the point that both

IS

Mr. Florence and petitioner in Elicanich raised as to what the

18

government says the principle is upon which the Court is to

17

determine whether there is a retroactivity question or not.

18

I think it is not a fair reading of our argument to

19

say that we have concocted the magical term "landmark," and

20

that it is only landmark cases which we argue would not be

2s

retroactive.

22

activity question,which may in some cases be a hard one, though

23

I donvt think it is here, has to be made in terms of the

24

practical question whether there has been a substantial change

25

in the rules by which, in the Fourth Amendment content for

I think the question of whether there is a retro­

26

|

1

example* police behavior has been moulded and could reasonably

2

moulded, or in the case of matters occurring at trial. Whether

3

there has been a substantial change in a rule that has been

4

used for the guidance of trial court.
In each case, as all of these

5

retroactivity con­

8

siderations, it must be considered in terms of the practical­

7

ity of the situation.
