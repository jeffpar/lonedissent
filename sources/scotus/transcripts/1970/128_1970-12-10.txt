ORAL ARGUMENT BY ROBERT' MORGAN , ATTORNEY

5

GENERAL OF NORTH CAROLINA, ON BEHALF OF
THE RESPONDENT

6

MR. MORGAN:

the Court:

9

Carolina.

10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

I am Robert Morgan, representing the State of North

As I heard the argument of Petitioner yesterday and

1?

as I studied the briefs filed in this case I find that one

12

thread that remains throughout the brief and throughout the

IS

argument is a contention that the juvenile system in North

14

Carolina affords no treatment different from that which

15

criminals would receive.

16

Now, on Tuesday night when I arrived in the office

1?

of Mr. Scanlan, here in Washington, I was handed a copy of the

18

Petitioner's reply brief for the first time, notwithstanding

19

the fact that all of the briefs in this case have been on file

20

for several months and I find it somewhat ironical that in a

2!

case such as this where the sole argument seems to be the

22

question of procedural due process.

23

Where the Petitioners plead in their brief as they

24

do on pages 18 and 19, for more formality in the courts? where

25

they claim that the courts often ignore the established rules
12

they claim that the courts are often sub­

taining what I believe to be distorted, misleading and actually
false representations of the North Carolina juvenile correc­
tions systemo
They cite in their brief and the full citation for
their position is a purported report made by a group of law
students from Duke University.

A copy of the report has not

been made available to me nor has it been distributed to my
knowledge to — a telephone call to the North Carolina Director
of Juvenile Corrections was made in which he informed me that
he' had not been supplied with a copy of the brief, although
he did agree that back in the summer of *69 he had agreed for
some law students to spend a week in each one of the correc­
tional institutions.
There has not been time for me to refute the
accusations made in this reply brief, nor would I attempt to
do so if time were available because X thinksuch accusations
or such information should be more properly made to the General
Assembly of North Carolina, a legislative body.

Or to a court,

or any court of law where an attack was being made upon such
conditions, if such conditions actually exist.
1 would be remiss, X think, since the brief is on
record and on file in this Court, the highest Court of our
13

1

land, if I did not state to the Court that while our

2

juvenile correctional institutions ax"e not all that they

13

ought to be? they are not all that we hope that they will be;
I do believe that they offer to the boys and girls who are
there, substantial and meaningful opportunities for education(
vocational treatment and for correction.
There are no fences around any of these institu­
tions with the exception of the Dillon School, where there
are 113 of the most aggressive and incorrigible juveniles.
Q

When did you say that brief was submitted?

A

On Tuesday night was when I received it.

Yes; it has# but we did not receive it until

Tuesday night.
Now# in every one of the juvenile correctional

institutions there are public schools.

6

the State of North Carolina# except graduate certificates and

many of the teachers# many of them hold graduate certificates.

Every teacher in these

Driver8s education is taught in these institutions

and the State of North Carolina furnishes automobiles for the

10

youngsters to drive while they are in such training.

gymnasiums at every institution and athletics is a part of the

12

regular curriculum.

There are

Four of them have swimming pools; summer camping

14

programs are carried out# using the regular 4-H Club camping

15

facilities of North Carolina# which are made available to them

16

justas they are made available to all the boys and girls across

17

North Carolina.

18

Tickets are regularly reserved at the Big-4 football

games in the area and of other college football games in the

20

neighborhood and in the areas where these schools are located#

21

as well as basketball games and scholastic events.

11

And 1 speak# Mr» Chief Justice# with some degree of
person experience and knowledge# for in the 1950s I served as
Judge of the Juvenile Court in my county and I visited every
single one of these institutions# with the exception of the two
that have been constructed most recently»

12

My wife presently is presently is serving as chair­

13

man of a state committee to raise funds to build a chapel at

14

the Dodge School and on each Sunday afternoon that the committee

15

has met there# my eight-year-old boy and my nine-year-old boy

16

have accompanied her and have played on the grounds with the

17

children and have eaten in the dining halls with the children

18

while she was at the meeting.

19

So# 1 believe# if it pleases the Court# that if the

20

conditions at these institutions have been as described in the

21

reply brief, that I would have been in a position to know some­

22

thing about it.

Are there any findings in the record of these

There are no findings„ Your Honor, and none

charges?

of the information contained in the reply brief which attacks

5

the conditions that are under — and 1 note that in a Fifth

6

Circuit case, Mitchell versus Tradewinds Company, 209 Fed.2d,

7

278, the Court ordered such information in a brief stricken,

8

saying that "We know of no basis under which it would be ad­

9

missible for such to be injected into litigation

at the

10

Appellate level.

11

District Court, it should have been tendered in the usual way."
Q

12
13

Relevant to the issue being tried in the

Suppose that were true; what effect would it

have upon the legal issues here?
A

14

Mr. Justice Black, I think it would have no

15

real effect, because if it were true, the same conditions and

16

the same circumstances would apply to a youngster who is con­

17

victed by a jury as one who is convicted by a judge sitting

18

alone.

19

cate to this Court that we treat youngsters or juveniles as

20

criminals and therefore, that the entire criminal procedure,

21

all criminal safeguards and procedures should be provided.

22

1 think the purpose of it being submitted was to indi­

And now, may it please the Court, with that brief

23

statement, I would like to return to what 1 consider to be the

24

relevant issues and the facts in this case, and that, is that

25

one issue; Does the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment
16

1

require a jury trial for a juvenile charged with delinquency?

2

This is a question of nationwide import,

3

important to the State of Maryland, for instance, a state from

4

which the Johnson case arises that's on this docket now.

5

I think that it's

It's important to the District of Columbia where the

6

Congress has just recently removed the right of jury trial.

7

And while it is important to my state and especially to my

8

state as a matter of constitutional law and constitutional

0

principle, Iem frank to admit to this court that I do not think

IS

that jury trials will impede any undue hardship on my state

n

except perhaps in the four or five more larger metropolitan

12

areas, such as Charlotte, Raleigh and Greensboro, where the

13

court dockets are already crowded and where a delay of as much

14

as two years is not at all unusual.

15

And I might add that --

16

Q

— cases, Mr, Attorney General?

I?

A

Yes, sir.

And, Mr. Chief Justice, there are

18

noprovisions in our law for a jury trial in the District Court.

19

Therefore, if -this Court should -order that a juvenile is en­

20

titled to a jury trial then there .v/ould have to foe of necessity

21

transferred to the Superior Court,

22

Q

That's the court of general jurisdiction?

23

A

Yes, sir; that is the court of general

24
25

jurisdiction.
Q

Well, are you suggesting that the consequence

17

i

of a jury ferial to your state means that all persons of every

2

age will be tried in the regular criminal court?

s

A

No, sir? I think, YourHonor, that if such

4

were to be true, while the general court of general jurisdictio a

s

would probably have to conduct the trial because that's where

6

we have jury trials, I think the same safeguards and procedural

7

safeguards which this Court has laid down in the Gault and

8

Kent and Winship cases, and which are spelled out in our

9

statute, would apply.

10

Q

In other words, the Superior Court would

U

sit as a juvenile court, but with all the other panoply of the

12

trial?

13

A

Yes, sir, that is my opinion.

14

Q

The District Court Judges do not sit on the

15

Superior Court?

16

A

No, sir.

17

Q

Are all your District Court Judges lawyers?

18

A

With the exception of a very few, Your Honor,

19

but we just recently adopted a new constitution, which requires

20

all judges to be lawyers.

21

a grandfather clause as far as those who are presently sitting.

22
23
24
25

Q

However, it does not apply “-it has

The DisMefc Court Judges do things other than

juvenile work, of course?
A

Yes, sir, their exercise of general jurisdic­

tion with regard to misdemeanors and civil jurisdiction up in

18

!

Blatters involving $5,000 or less.
Q

2

Would you say your District Court Judges are

2

chosen or by experience, are especially qualified in juvenile

4

work or not?

5

A

Mr. Justice White, within the last decad© we

6

brought about in North Carolina, a complete revision of our

7

criminal justice system.

8

usually from two or three counties and he is generally well-

S

qualified o

A District Court Judge is elected

Most of them are lawyers; one is designated as a

10

chief judge and he designatas a particular judge, generally,

11

to sit as juvenile court judge and tranquil(?) judge.

12

this is not always true, because you may have one particular

13

district where you may only have one or two judges.

14
15

16

Now,

But, generally you do have one designated specifi­
cally for this purpose.
I think that this is a very proper question for this

17

Court to consider, and I think one that should be resolved,

18

after research and study on this case I am satisfied that if

19

jury trials are to be accorded to juveniles then it should be

20

done by the legislative body and not be required by this Court

21

22
23
24
23

on the constitutional provisions.
1 personally favor jury trials.

I was a defense

attorney for 15 years and in almost every criminal case, after
being employed, I would automatically request a jury trial.
I didn’t always insist on it; quite frequently I must state
19

1

that I used it for the purpose of plea bargaining and Iem

2

afraid that if

3

that it will not be long before the same thing would be true

4

here »

5

juvenile courts are allowed to have jury trials

Now# this Court has already said in the three cases

Q

What about your trials that you actually

was fairly successful --

11

Q

3

tried?

Oh# yes# but how about your choice of jury

or bench trial?

12
13

A

I beg your pardon.

14

Q

What about your choice on the cases that

actually went to trial? jury or bench?

15
16

A

Most of them were jury.

17

Q

Why was tit at?

18

A

Mr. Justice White# as a defense attorney# of

course# I normally preferred a jury*

19
20

Q

Well# that’s what you said# but I wondered

A

I think # frankly # because my chances of

why.

21
22

getting an acquittal were greater.

23
24

Q

Why is that?

23

A

I thought that I could be more persuasive
20

I

1

with 12 men than I could with one.

2

with this Court as a defense attorney —

3
4

Q

•

I’m being quite candid

This is what jury trials are all about, in

many respects.

5

A

Yes, sir.

6

Q

The thing right here is that you have a

7

cross-section and historically it was to soften the blow;

8

wasn't it?

S

io

A

Yes, siri that’s my understanding of it.

And I think that this Court has said, of course, tha

11

so far in the Kent case and the Gault case and the Winship

12

case, that all

13

which are afforded to a criminal or a person charged with

14

committing a crime are afforded to a juvenile, with the excep­

IS

tion of jury trials and, of course, public hearings which would

18

be required by the Sixth Amendment.

17
18
'19

practically all of the procedural safeguards

I’m afraid that if jury trials are afforded to
juveniles that many of the advantages of the juvenile court
system would have been destroyed.

I think, for instance, the

20

question of public trials, for all practical purposes, would

21

have been destroyed.

22

clude the public you still have 12 jurors and in the course of

23

selecting those 12 jurors you probably have subjected many

24

other prospective to questioning on their voir dire.

25

While it still would be possible to ex­

So, I think for that purpose it v/ould practically
21

destroy that effectiveness»

In your state are the newspapers permitted tc

5

A

I should correct that»

7

but not the names.

E

the confidentiality of the records of the juvenile courts is

8

more of a reality than rhetoric,, because the juvenile court

16

of course? most people in -the community know that this

youngster is involved with delinquency proceedings? but it’s

not widespread? it's not known? it°s not disseminated across

19

the state and across the nation.

20

important.

21

Q

And I do think that this is

Mr. Morgan? what about giving the juvenile

22

the choice of having a trial in the juvenile court as set up

23

as of today? or to give that up and say nX would rather have

24

a jury trial in Superior Court.”

25

A

Give him the choice.

I think that this still would impede the

22

1

administration of justice because I think eventually we would
see that jury trials are continually requested.

For instance,

3

in March of 1970 there ware 288 juveniles waiting for a jury-

4

trial her® in this area.

5

And Mr. Justice Marshall, there is one other

6

question that deserves consideration by this Court in that

7

connection.

8

the waiver of a jury trial of a person charged with a crime.

9

Now, just what effect a decision of this Court requiring a jury

The North Carolina Constitution does not permit

10

trial would have on that provision is problematical.

1.1

have been several"'attempts through the years made to permit

12

the waiver of a jury trial and it has always been defeated.

13

The only time that a jury trial can be waived is by a person

14

charged with a petty offense.

There

15

I notice that my time is about, up.

1 would like to

16

mention two points which I think are crucial.

The Petitioners

17

contend in their brief that judges are likely to be arbitrary

18

and capricious.

19

page 30 in footnote 30, that they make the strongest argument

20

against that statement.

21

statistics — for instance, they say that in the District of

22

Columbia in 1968 there were,only 32 requests for jury trials

23

out of 3,196? less than one percent.

24
25

I say to this Court that in their own brief on

On that footnote they give the

In 1969 there were only 28 out of 2,863? again, less
•than one percent.

They give 'the figures for Denver in which
23

t

1

they say in 1969 there ware 1892 delinquency petitions and

2

13 resulted in jury trials; less than one percent and 1

3

believe this is the strongest argument against their statement

4

that judges acting alone are likely to be arbitrary and

5

capricious .

6

Mow # one other point I would like to mention is that

1

there is no contention by the Petitioners in this case that

8

the judge Was partial or that he was unfair or that he dis-

9

criminated in any way.

There is no contention that the

10

evidence was not sufficient to find that the adjudication ~

11

make the adjudication by the evidence and beyond the reasonable

12

doubt.

13

a finding of fact and conclusions of law in writing and this

14

can be appealed to the Appellate Courts and if there is an

15

insufficiency of evidence to support it# then the Appellate

IS

Courts can either reverse or acquit.

n

The law in North Carolina requires that the judge make

And one possible danger I see and I would like to

m

mention to this Court in closing# is that shortly after an

19

adjudication by the court that a person charged with a crime

20

carrying a possible punishment of more than six months is en­

%l

titled to a lawyer# the North Carolina legislature# out of

22

necessity reduced the maximum penalty for driving drunk and

23

many other offenses# in order to get around -this provision be­

24

cause it was felt that it would so bog down our courts that

25

justice would be impeded.

24

(

1

And I'm afraid that if such were to happen here*

2

that we might find such restrictions placed upon the juvenile

V

court .and I say to you that if you should restrict the amount

4

of time that a juvenile could be put into a correctional in­

5

stitution to six months, you would not give him any meaningful

6

training or vocational training or education and that then it

7

might very well become six months of punishment, rather than

8

six months of correction.
Q

9
20

What's the annual volume, Mr. Morgan* of

juvenile cases now in North Carolina?
A

19

Mr. Justice Harlan, I don't know.

22

16

ORAL ARGUMENT BY ALFRED L. SCANLAN, ESQ.

£

FOR NATIONAL COUNCIL OF JUVENILE COURT JUDGES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE

13

Mr. Scanlon.

MR. SCANLON;

Thank you Mr.Chief Justice, and may

it please the Courts
I appear today for the National CounEfcl of Juvenile

14

Court Judges, who vmpport the Appellees in this case and the

15

case which follows; Humber 322 in maintaining that the Sixth

!S

Amendment jury trial right is not applicable to the states

17

through the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment should

18

not be applied to juvenile proceedings.

19

And I might say that counsel has n© quarrel with

20

and did not at the time those cases were decided; the Gault

21

and Winship cases.

22

two cases unquestionably are indispensable to fair procedure.

23
24

25

The. rights which this Court upheld in those

Indeed, actually the rights that this Court enun­
ciated in Gault are elementary procedural rights applicable
in almost any civil proceeding that I can conceive of? the
26

1

adversary, that is.

2

counsel if you can’t afford it and in the civil law we’re

The only one that is not is the right to

moving in that direction»
4

In Winship this Court found that the reasonable

5

doubt standard which is adhered to by every State in the Union

6

since colonial times, since common law times, is a prime

7

instrument for reducing the risk of error in fact-finding

8

in a proceeding by which a man may lose his liberty.

9

I don’t think this Court has held, and it’s

10

indicated by not making the jury trial retroactive, yet it

11

considers the jury trial indisp@nsi.ble t© the integrity of the

12

fact-finding process.

13

Moreover, there is enough dispute about the merits

14

of the jury trial to raise at least a question of whether it’s

15

wise to extend it in another area unless the call for its

16

applicability is overwhelming, and strong, at least.

17

think that that can be fairly said when the right is attempted

13

to be extended to an area where it has not held forth before,

13

except in some states, in the juvenile court proceeding.

20

I don’t

And I think this Court, when it gave us the

21

reasonable doubt standard for juvenile court proceedings, gave

22

some indication that it would weigh whether or not the jury

23

trial’s advantages in the juvenile court system offset its

24

disadvantages with respect to the adjudication procedure.

25

You will recall,with this Court speaking through

27

t

Mr. Justice Brennan, in that case, conceded, or was cf the

z

opinion that the reasonable doubt standard did not have any

adverse effect on the informality, the speed or the flexibility

4

of the adjudication and concurring, Mr. Justice Harlan said

B

about the same thing, but added two other factors that

$

weighed in his mind, whether or not the addition of the rights

7

would increase the possibility of public stigma of the juvenile

8

and whether or not it would interfere with the worthy goal of

9

rehabilitation.

10

I think analysing the jury trial right in light of

11

those comments and balancing what it brings to the adjudication

12

proceedings, both by way of good, and by way of bad, I think

33

that the scales are tipped in the balance on the side of not

14

requiring a jury trial.

15

I would argue that many children would be traumati-

I would like to deal in closing with one point that

was adverted- to by the Attorney Generals there is no question

7

but if the jury ~ if the juvenile system, the rehabilitation

goal is — in North Carolina or anywhere, and indeed, it has

9

fallen short in many states — maybe -the Duke study is

absolutely right; I don't know»

states where the rehabilitative ideal is more an illusion than

a fact.

There are certainly other

Could I ask you: in those states that now

It usually is did the juvenile do the act

22

within the definition of the state statute.

In most of the states if he does this act he

RfihUTTAL ARGUMENT BY MICHAEL MELTSNER, ESQ.

Thank you, Mr, Scanlon,

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

17
18

MR. MfciLTSNER's

Thank you, Mr, Chief "Justice.

19

Mr, Justice White, it dawned on me late last night

20

that the question you asked me yesterday was the question that

2!

you just asked Mr. Scanlon and I must have totally misunder­

22

stood it and if, as I now understand the question, it is

28

whether, after . a jury finds that a juvenile has committed the

24

act, whether a judge can nevertheless, decide that he is not

25

delinquent.

The answer I give is an emphatic "yes,”

33

And that

I

is indeed

a
s

Q

Under North Carolina law?

A

That is indeed the case under North

4

Carolina law* as best one can. tell* given of course the fact

5

that «Aere aren’t any jury trials.

6

Q

So 1st me ask you; the jury trial that you

7

are contending for would be a jury trial only to consider

8

whether the act was committed?
A

§

That is correct.

The juvenile court judge

10

would retain the flexibility,* and this is what^eTTSfxink the

11

juvenile court is all about; to not adjudicate the youth a

12

delinquent regardless of the findings of the jury.

13

provided for in North Carolina lav/ and is* in .fact* what the

14

That is

judge did . -\n this case* if one reads the order of commitment.
He first said; "You have committed an act which*

IS

W

if an adult did it* would be a criminal act*" and then found

17

delinquency.

IS

Q

Does North Carolina have jury sentencing*

A

Not that I know of* Your Honor.

19

too?

20
21

22
23

I don’t

know.
There are* in addition to that, several small points
that 1 would

like to make.

24

First of all* the Attorney General has stated that

25

in his judgment juvenile cases would have to be automatically

34

1

transferred to another court if this court held that the right

2

t© jury trial applies* but I really don't see why he reached

3

that conclusion because the very court we're concerned with

4

here* the District Court* presently tries civil cases with

5

juries at the present time.
Secondly* the matter of the reply brief* a matter

6
7

which causes me some embarrassment.

This brief was printed

8

by the Court* as this case is here in forma pauperis* and the

9

brief was filed with this Court* as Mr. Justice Stewart said*

10

on the 2nd of December.

11

an abundance of caution* did not mail the brief* feeling that

12

perhaps

13

I found this out and I immediately took the brief to Mr.

14

Scanlan's office.

15

another copy for Mr. Morgan and asked Mr, Scanlan to please

1®

they would cross the lawyers.

When I got here Monday

I took a copy and served Mr. Scanlan; I took

give it to him as soon as he arrived.
And this brief was not — was submitted in reply

17
13

Apparently the Clerk's office* out of

to the claim made by my adversaries that rehabilitative pur­

19

poses of North Carolina's juvenile law justified denial of

20

trial by jury.
Q

2?
22
23

24
25

Well* is there any real relevance — any

connection to the right to jury trial and the rehabilitation
conditions?

I don't think so* because I think it's puni-i

Q

2

Well, I know, but what was the relevance to

the material you submitted in your reply brief?

A

3

There was some suggestion in the brief of the

4

State of North Carolina that its juvenile institutions were

5

totally different from the rest and we merely sought to dispel

6

any such impression by referring to a study done under the
*

1

auspices of the Duke haw School and the Office of Economic

8

Opportunity, which took some ten weeks in the summer of 1969s

9

it included many law students, attorneys with the Duke Center

1©

and sight visits to all the North Carolina juvenile institu­

the juvenile judge the court may be opened and newspaper
