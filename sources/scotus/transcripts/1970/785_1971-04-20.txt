Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Courts
This case is here on writ of certiorari to the
Sixth Circuit.

The Board issued its order directing the

Respondent Utility District t© bargain collectively with the
union which employees of the district in an appropriate unit
designated ©s their bargaining representative.
The District, contending that underthe laws ©£ the
State ©£ Tennessee that it is a political subdivision ©r an
©f instrumentality ©f the state, it has

refused to comply

with the order.
.

25

The statute specifically excludes from the
definition of the term "employer," the United States or any
State or any political subdivision thereof.
The two questions presented here are first:
whether, for purposes of the Labor Act, Federal standards or
state law governs the determination whether an entity is a
political subdivision within the meaning of the statute ©r an
2

1

employer within the meaning of the statute»

2

Secondly, if Federal standards and not state law

3

govern that defcerraination, whether the board3s finding that

4

the district here is not a political subdivision within the

5

meaning of the Labor Act, but is an employer, is entitled to

6

affirmance»

7

The Court below, rejecting the Board’s view, held

3

that state law is controlling with respect to the determination

9

of whether an entity is a political subdivision ©r not, and on

SO

-the basis of the State Code of the State of TEnnessee, as a

11

decision of -the Supreme Court of Tennessee as confirming con­

12

cerning the legislation, it held that the District here was a

13

political subdivision within the meaning of the Labor Act, and

14

therefore not an employer»

IS

Q

I do not recall from the briefs, Mr»

16

Manoli, but does the Tennessee Law permit private corporations,:

17

that is, the telephone company, for example, t© exercise the

18

right of eminent domain?

19

20
21

22

A

Yes, sir? it does»

There are cases that

are cited in our brief indicating
Q

I wasn’t sure that they applied to

Tennessee cases.

23

A

They are Tennessee cases

24

Q

It's fairly common everywhere?

25

A

Yes, it is.

3

Eminent domain is not a

1

unique characteristic of political subdivisions»

Private

2

concerns, quasi public, you might say, have been given that

3

sort of authority»
Now, 1 want to summarize a little bit more at

4
5

length -than is normally done in this Court, but I do want to

6

summarize the facts, the salient facts that relate to the

7

District's status as an employer under the act or as

8

would have it, as a political subdivision,» under the act»
The District sells and distributes natural gas

9
10

without profit fe© residential homes, commercial businesses and

11

industrial firms in Hawkins County, TEnnessee»

It was incor­

porated in December 1957 underthe Tennessee Utility district

12

Law»

13

Under the provisions ©£ that law a group of local real

property holders in Hawkins County filed a petition with the

14

County Court setting forth

15

<u

statement of the need for the

circuit to be supplied, the estimated cost and the names of

16

three local residents proposed -as commissioners of the district

17

After a hearing the Chairman of the County Court

18

— the Chairman of the County Court is a Judge — -the Chairman

19

©f the County Court found 'that public convenience and neces­

20

sity justified the creation of the proposed district, that it

21

was economically sound and desirable and accordingly, granted

22

a petition»

23

The Chairman of the County Court, as required by

24

the state law, appointed as commissioners of the newly created

13

The district has no power to levy or collect

The powers of the district are vastesd in and

14

exercised by a three-member board of commissioners.

15

commissioners are not subject to county or state regulations.

16

They adopt the necessary rules and regulations and set the

17

district service fees.

18

the district and under their supervision the matters of the

19

district, hires and fires employees and sets their wages.

20

Neither the state nor the county has any control over the

21

district's employees.

22

The

They control the labor relations ©£

The state statute also gives the district the

23

power of eminent domain? as the Chief Justice has already

24

alluded to, and it authorises the Board of Commissioners to

25

inquire into any matter relating feo the business of the
i

5

I
1

t

district and to carry out this/function and to issue sub­

2

poenas and administer oaths.
Finally, this enabling Tennessee statue provides

3
4

that a utility district' is a municipality or a public corpora­

5

tion and exempts it from state, county or local taxation.

6

Supreme Court of Tennessee has upheld this tax exemption ©n

7

the grounds that such a district is an arm or instrumentality

3

of the state.

The

As S stated earlier, the Court below concluded

9
10

that state law governs determination of whether an entity is

11

a political subdivision or not, and under the laws of

12

Tennessee, as confirmed by the highest court of that state,

13

the district here is a political subdivision and therefore

14

refused t© enforce the Board8s bargaining order.
The Fourth Circuit, on the other hand, in dealing

15
16

with a related type of problem, has rejected the contention

17

that state law governs the determination of whether an entity

18

is a political subdivision or not and has held the Federal

19

standards govern the determination of whether or not a particu­

20

lar entity is a political subdivision or not.

21

Here —

Q

Well, there doesn't seem to be any

10

silent; are silent as to the meaning that Congress ought t©

!1

attribute to the phrase "political subdivision of the state.”

12

The obvious purpose, of course, of Congress was to avoid inter­

13

ference into the labor relations, the employment relations

'14
15

between a governmental entity and its employees.
Now, I shall not attempt to give any kind of a

16

comprehensive definition of what a political subdivision is.

17

Indeed, the cases tell us.

18

may be a political subdivision for the purpose of on© statute

19

and not another.

20

The cases tell us that an entity

Now, any definition of a political subdivision

21

for the purpose of the statute, must, I think, taka into

22

account the basic purpose which underlies the governmental

23

exemption in the statutes namely, the avoidance of interfar-

24

anca, the avoidance of interference into the employment and

.25

labor relations between a governmental entity and its employees

So# therefore the threshold question in this

17

Whether any such power has ever been exercised with respect to
*
any of these districts — we ar® told that there are approxi­

18

mately 270 of them in the Stats of Tennessee — I don't know.

19

Now, the utility system is owned by the district

20

itself and is not state property.

It has no authority to levy

21

taxes and must meat its expenses and obligations from its

22

revenues.
The district is completely autonomous in the

23
24

conduct ©£ its affairs and the state exercises no supervisory

25

power over the conduct of the district's day-to-day affairs @r
9
i

t

its operations.

2

any state public utility consols si on from exercising any juris-”

3

diction over the management ©r control ©f the system ©r its

4

rates or charges.

5

Indeed, the Tennessee statute expressly bars

Finally, the District alone exercises the power

6

to hire and fire employees.

The state does not control, either

7

directly ©r indirectly the terms and conditions of employment

8

for the district.

by the Circuit Court ©f Appeals in the State of Tennessee,

And apparently, on the basis ©f a decision

10

apparently these employees are not deesied to too subject to the

11

state restrictions applicable to state or municipal employees

12

with respect to strikes and picketing.

13

Essentially, the district appears to be more

14

.

Essentially it's a private venture, t© be sure,

15

for the benefit of the community, but nonetheless, a private

16

venture having no identity or relationship to the state.
Hew, of course, the State of Tennessee has seen

17
18

fit in its legislature her© t© characterise, to label this

19

district here as a political subdivision ©f the st&e, a

20

municipality.

24

And the general principle is that normally that

2

Congress intends that its law shall have uniform application

Now, of course the State has an important inter­

its political subdivisions and the board of

7

interest in defining its political subdivisions„

8

iterest, it seems to us, must be weighed against the policies

9

of fee statute and the uniform application of those policies

io

which this Court has repeatedly confirmed Congress intended.

Now,, local considerations, local problems may prompt

But that

12

a state to characterise as a political subdivision what is

13

essentially — take private ventures, having no real identity

14

or relationship to the state and over which the state exercises

15

no control.

16

If state-by-state characterisations have an interest

problem then the result might well be a patchwork of policies

tion in this statute, namely the avoidance of interference in
the employment and labor relations between a governmental
employee and its employees.
I don’t believe it’s wide of the mark to say feat in
this particular case that the- State of Tenneese has since seen
11

1

seen fit to label a district as a political subdivision,, not

2

because it really regards it as an arm or instrumentality or

department of the state, but rather because it sought to give

cases.

But the problem, however, is much broader than that

because in this particular state, for example, in Tennessee,
we are told that there are 270 of these particular districts.
Now, what the situation may be in other states, there may be
difference, of course.

In some cases perhaps the district

We had that case?,, and of course that was

only a regional director who made that decision.

3

decision to the board itself? the board has expressly over­

cular case.
So, that particular ease has no more precedential

It is Respondent’s position further that there was

8

no conflict between the Hawkins County case in the Sixth

It is simply submitted that the board inadequately
and improperly considered the economic realities of the
statutory purposes, and that to the extent the Court of
Appeals below In the last two sentences of the opinion, which
was several pages long, stated that “'state law is controlling,
Respondent explains this the same way that the board has
explained one of its decisions in its brief that state law
is controlling.

The board has held state law to be control­

ling but now on page 19 on a footnote to itsbrief it states
that thatlanguage wasnot necessary for the result reached, and
that is exactly the position of Respondent here.
Because, what the Court ©f Appeals did for several

the Courts
In accordance with the rule of law that we contend

8

attention several undisputed, relevant facts in this record

9

that have not ©©an. Mentioned heretofore, some of which we

10

11

submit have not been "properly understood by the" board.
In the first place, Section 62615 TCA, the same

IE

utility district law designates a utility district's records

13

as “public records.88

14

Secondly, as referred to by counsel, a utility

15

district has the power to issue subpoenas for witnesses and

16

has the power to administer oaths to witnesses.

17

19
2©
21

24
25

Now, reference was made by the board's counsel to
that section of the Act, 62613 that specifically exempts a
utility district ,£roaregulation by the Tennessee Railroad
and Public Utilities Commission.
What the board has done since the outset of this
litigation is not understand the significance of that.

This

entity is exempt, privately-owned public utilities and rail­
roads are regulated.
Also, under several Federal statutes acknowledgment
34

I

has been made that the utility district is a municipality.

2

For instance# the employees of the district are covered under

3

the Social Security law on a voluntary rather than a mandatory

4

basis# which is of course a test for private enterprise.

for municipal employees and the district has operated under
this language.

There is & counterpart section in the

Tennessee Code# allowing a municipality to adopt this.

Is it also for nonprofit corporations# that

same provision?
A

about it# but X b&lieve it's only for municipalities.

Now, in reference to the power of eminent domain
that the Chief Justice asked originally about? this district
not only has the power of eminent domain but has it against
other governmental enfeifces, which certainly is a stronger form
of the power of eminent domain than let’s say a telephone
company might have.
In addition to these factors that we have referred
to, Section 62612 ©f the Utility District Act grants to the
district all the powers necessary and requisite, capable of
being delegated by the legislature.
So, we contend that when all of these factors are

16

added up and the totality ©f the picture is before this

17

Court the conclusion must follow that we have an exempt

18

I would like, in addition to the Lafayette-Lincoln
case, which is an electric system under the Tennessee Muni­
cipal Electric Plant Law, and which is practically identical

23

granting the exemption.

exemption to the City of Austell Natural Gas System.
