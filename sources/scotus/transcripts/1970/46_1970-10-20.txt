Thia is ,n appeal under Section~ of the Voting Rights

'tf-'

·~ct of _%5 in the three-judge court in the Southern District

I he

His'.3i.ssippi, th£ fourth such appeal in three term of Court.
firot three ha'ling been decided by this court. reversing

13 !the lcr.ior court in the case of Allen v. State Board of Elections.

14

1 believe: the questtori on the merits here is quite

15

imple und I plan to devote but a s~all portion of the argument

16

emonso:;r.atin9 that the Court below wa s wrong on all three of

17
t8
19

the questions it f~ced.
The vital question in this case is the questi on of

relief , alld that qi.:~sti on goes to the he,11:t of whether Sect ion 5

20

f the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is to be permitted to occupy

21

lthe critical place the Congress intended for it in 1965 and re -

22 • ffiriood i t

23
24

in the strongest po.aoible ter ms when i t ex t ended

the Act in 1970.

To advert very briefly to the f&ct the C i ty of Ce nton

25 in Mississippi fo:i.· i ts 111Unicipal elections in 1969, adopted three
2

1 changes in the proceuure that governed the prior municipal

2 election in lS65.
3

TLey went from individual ward elections to

at-large ~J.ectio11s i r. a town in which tl-.e::e are two wards that

4 are ve:ty heavily blac.; k .

'.l'hcy moved the polling places . in one

5 case f::cm the town s , u.are to an old jail, and 0 in another ca~e,
6

from the :niddl.e of a black neighborhood--a heavily black ward--

7

to a point just adja,•ent to a newly en.ne,md white neighborhoodr

8

and , third , they ext~nded the boundaries of the town in such

9

a way as to add seve.. al hundred net-additlon.al white residents .

10

hat 13 , 3averal hun · red more white residents than black resi-

11

dents.

12

Q

Which were the black wards . Mr. Derfner?
The b..ack wards . Mro Justice Blackman, are 3

13

14

and 4, znd my Brief "'iveo the--I believe the record, too, gives

15

the registration fig :ires for all the wards.
All these c hanges ore familiar ones; they are all

17

changes of the type chat have been submitted by other jurie-

ts dictions to the Atto-ney- Ger-eral 0 as can be shown by looking at
' "'-.Jg p,1ge

--

30H of the Rous , hearings.

They ere all changes of the

20

type thilt Congress mnntior.cd many. raany ticoes in the debates of

21

1969 and 70 on the e : tension.

22

is Corigi-essman McCulloch, who wac perhaps the leading minority

23

lhmber ill the House involved both in the 1965 Act and the 197ll

24

25

t:fP'!S that were cove,:ed b-.f the Votit19--by Section 5.

The beat example of that. perhaps .

A

18

I believe they did not cite it.

19 cert~inly aware of itu

20

23

It--that having come from·•-three of

thoee caaes having come fro111 that same court.
So, I sa1, t?ult: the--the merits ure--are an easy

21
22

They were

queationv
The fina:. queotion is, what is the rolief to be given

2A

in this caae, and, on a very aimple plane, that is nn easy

25

question. tooo

The very simple plane says c
5

there mu:,t be a new

•

1

2

lection.

And we maintain there IIIWlt be a new election and that

there cannot be any question about that.

The law is clear in

3

lection cases--in cases sucb ae Haroer v. Cambeth in the 5th

4

ircuitr or the united states v . Barber County.

5

iatrict court.

Cases in the

Cases such as Padnott v. Amos in that example--

6

thllt. if you--if you assert your remedies in timely fashion in a

7

oting case, particularly in a 15th Amendment case. but certainl

8

qually well in a 14th Amendment case. s uch as property tax

9

ases 0 or. more recently. apportionmGnt cases.

Then. if it

10

evelops after the election has been held--you did not get the

11

relief and the election is held-•if it develops thereafter that

12

you were entitled to have an injunction., the::, you were entitled

13

to have the election set aside.

14

I think this Court--

15

Q

Have we done that in reapportionment cases?

16

A

I am not certain that this Court has done that.

17

bis Court bas certainly indicated that could be done. and l01ter

18

court• have done it.

I know the 5th Circuit has done it on a

19

case coming from Monroe County. Missi.asippi.-

20

Q

Well, thi.a Court has refused to do it in All.en.

21

A

This court hll• refused to do it in--in Allen.

22

if you are talking about thi.a case, this Court said specifically

23

that these Section 5 questione , coverage questione. involve com-

24

plex issues of first impression, issues subject to rational di.a-

25

agreement.

The state enactments were not so clearly subject to
6-7

t

Secticn 5 0 and ao forth.

2

effect to our deci ion,

Therefore. we give only prospective

:,: think that was a clea~ indi.cat:i.on, ao clear--pe:dmps

3
4

as c lear an indication ao the exp1.icit language in the tax

5

case.:i,, that .:hence forward j1.1risdiction3 were to be on notice

6

that if they did not submit 0 the pzope:c re1112dy was a n-ew electio. •
And that .s a traditional--aa ! say--basically it has

7

8

co= t;c be a tradi,.ional equitable remedy in election cases .

9

and. I thin:< that ;he ordinary rule there would be that there

10

should be a new cl :c.;ion u.-;J.ees there is sp'!!cial ci:.ccumso::ancas.,

t1

There t•ere spccia, circuro::itances in Allen, a.:; there often are

12

when~-t hen a court., and thie Court especially,, decides a case

t3

invol7:.ng a whole ww body of law.
Th'.?rc arc

t5

there 2.e no ri=aso!" that the c i ty of C:ir.ton h:is advanced, or

16

could c1.dvance for 1hy it should not be governed by the general

17

rule.

Q

What are the tcxmo for the aldernren here?

The election in tl.is caae, did take place in Octobe:r•-tho?

22

pri1u.;cj_es and the 1ene,:nl election" in October. 1969.

23

The basic queotion 0 a1'ld thio is the--

24

Q

25

How can the--this is a practical m3tt~r--how

can y,:,u have. if 110u had a

new election. how can you compel
8

I certainly admit th"Elt there would. in some c a s e s.

11

have to be an impo.;&ibility exception ind icating that there

12

might h:ive to be a change.

c i ty co.ild corr.e fo::ward and shew that it were totally im-

14

A

11

12

is tak:m there will b~ no Secticn S in

And if the

declaratory judgment aoes not give us a r,ew election.
Quite fri.ln}·ly,

13

r. thinl;:--in this cuse. what we hava is

14

the a~vantage of a C'•:mgres3 that , in 1969 nr.d 1970, debated

15

cxtensi.vo!y through several hundred pages of the Cor..gressional

16

Record, and at leas t twelve to fifteen hundred pages of hear-

17

ings and reports. vJ·at should happen to t.he Voting Rights Act

18

of 1965.

19

that deb.3te. aside 'rom questions such as--involving new

20

questions. such as t.he gcne:i:al banning of :i.U.iteracy tests,

21

and the 18-year-old vote, and the absent--xeoidencc a nd ab-

22

sentce provision, ttie bulk of the argument dealt with Section

23

I think i· is a fair state1111!nt that the bulk of

s.

And the de1>ate is replete with--ith the diocus sio11

24

over Sections.

Baoically

t~e history ig quite clear:

25

bill was introduced which. I believe thu record will. show, had
11

a

t

Administration backing; the Justice Department testified for it.

2

A bill wao introduce-:, which would have abolished the pre-

3

clearam:'! procedurec of Section

5

the Deputy Assistant Attorney-General. David Norrr.an.

Norman teatified exc ,usively that Secti--l.:h3t there was no need

10

for Section 5 becaU!3e 0 in fact, all Section S did was to pro-

11

vide the following r~medies, explicitedly stated by Mr. Norman:

12

Section 5 p:·ovides only the remedy that if you win a

13

Section 5 case then the ju:risdiction that did not aubnit the

14

matter to the Attorney-General or tbe District of Columbia

15

Court must then aubn:;,.t it o

16

The congressional debates and the outcome of what

17

happened in Congress is as clear a refutati:on of that·•-of that

t8

position as is possible to take.

courP.e 0 has Joeen in existence long before the Vot•ing Rights Act

waa eve~ drearccd of. and the State law under which the city

10

proceeded.
The second th5.ng is that the 1962 statute which per-

t1

12

mitted elections at-large was also,, of couree 0 in existence

13

prior to the Voting Rights Act , and it is true that the city

14

had not follO"-.,ed i . or did not follow it J.n °65.
Thoue are the two things which l would like to point

15
16

17

out in view of the state~ent by counsel opposite that these
things were post-A, len.

They actually were not post-Allen.

18

They were done prier to or about the same time that the

19

Allen decioion was handed down by this Court.
The point that Appellees would like--would like to

20
21

22

23
24
25

urge is this:--And the question before the Court as we see it
is this:

Does the Cour t wish to expand or expand the enterpretation of Section 5 as laid down in the Allen case to the
extent which Appellants urge and reached the appalling ::esult

32

I

that 95 per cent of any municipal enactment or administration

2

of an en'lctment would have to be submitted to the Attorney-

3

General of the Unit'!d States or to the court of Appeals for

4

the Diatrict of Columbia before it is effecti.ve. or, should

5

the Court put the bit and briddle of reason and common sense

6

on Section 5 and co,fine it within the practical bour.ds which

7
