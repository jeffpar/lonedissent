The Petitioner here comes under the

different name of 'the United Transportation Union, but the
reason for that is because the Trainmen have been merged into
that successor union.
At all times that the injunctions were issued in
this case the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen was the
defendant.

On the appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court? the

merger into the surviving union took place.

This case began at the filing of a complaint in

.1959 and basically that complaint paraphrased some of the

a

language and the holdings of the Illinois Supreme Court in

9

the opinion of In Re Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen,

In

was that the ease was moot because of the fact that it had

While the appeal

was pending, this Court handed down its opinion in 1964

Brotherhood.

3

The Michigan-. Supreme Court, after being informed

4

of the opinion in this Court, reversed and remanded and

5

specifically stated that permission for the amendment of

6

Plaintiff’s bill to seek, if it be so advised, relief not

7

inconsistent with this Court’s opinion in 1964 Brotherhood,

8

The next action in the trial court was a motion

9

for a judgment in accordance with a. 1965 injunction decree of

10

theCity Court of Richmond,

11

In 1966 the Virginia Supreme Court entered its opinion on the

12

appeal from the 1965 decree and reversed the — part of that

13

opinion which attempted to draw a line between solicitation

14

and between recommendations and urging.

15

That motion was not acted upon.

The State Bar of Virginia petitioned for a

16

certiorari to this Court and the Brotherhood of Railroad

\?

Trainmen opposed the petitioni so the petition was denied.

18

In 1967 this Court handed down it3 Mine Workers’ decision and

19

following that decision the trial court in this case handed

20

down the 1968 decree which is now before this Court.

21

In handing down that decree the trial judge in

22

this case stated that the Virginia Supreme Court’s reading

23

of this Court’s opinion in Brotherhood was sufficient to

24

warrant the promulgating of the decree in this case.

We then turn to the first question in this cases
whether or not this decree is contrary to this Court's

opinion in 1964 Brotherhood.

In that opinion, as in many

other opinions dealing with free speech, this Court has con­

3

sistently stated a rule of law which was ignored in this case.

4

The burden, this Court has stated, very clearly, very

correctly, so far as Iern concerned, is upon the State Bar to

prove substantive evils.

7

any substantive evil'®; indeed -there was no updating of the

complaint or any updating of the proof.

In this case there was no proof of

The proof in this case relates at the very latest

but the proofs failed to prove any majority and the finding

16

was that a large number, and infact, the finding does not

really show a large number.

18

there is a summary sheet which is Plaintiff’s Exhibit 17,

13

which shows a summary of the evidence presented to the

it creates a problem as to whether this is selected evidence

of the Brothers6 plan.

17

opposites it is not the unauthorized practice of law? the

18

union is not practicing law? the union is sending the cases

1©

to the union lawyer and seeing that the lawyer practices law»

20

If this is the practice of law it's a new definition of the

21

unauthorised practice of law, typically that arising when a

22

corporation itself acts through lawyers and the lawyers are

23

merely agents.

24
25

The Brothers' plan is exactly the

In this case there is no doubt that a retainer
contract is entered into between an injured employee and the

The second provisions- it seems to me, also is

such that would strike, as it could be interpreted, and that is

§

an ambiguous section, against the operation of this plant.

7

That prohibits informing any lawyer or lawyers that an

S

accident has been suffered by a member and furnishing the name

9

and address for the purpose of obtaining legal employment for

10

any lawyer.

And this, 1 think, is part and parcel of the

11

Brotherhood’s Plan as it reads.

12

seems to be a. method of subverting this Court’s language in

13

Trainmen.

As Virginia interpreted it it

In Trainmen this Court stated that of course

14

counsel had the same right to accept the case that the union

16

had in channeling the cases.

17

guage, but stated that it did not interpret it as such that

18

would permit the lawyer to do more than accept and never in­

19

20

any lawyer who did any more than accept.

It seems to me they have

7

been stricken down by the Mine Workers® case, because if you

8

can place a lawyer on a salary and not be guilty of any

violations constitutionally, it would seem to me that you

10

would have the right to do less than that, and that is to do

11

what the union used to do in this case, to limit the counsel's

12

fee to 25 percent.

13

The fifth injunction provision is a rather

14

peculiar one.

Now, the Virginia Supreme Court said that, there

18

could be no decree which prohibited solicitation, but. yet

19

let this provision stand, which does not prohibit solicitation

20

but prohibits solicitation plus the receiving of compensation,

21

as I read it.

22

It would seem to me that there is no evidence in

23

the record as to this and it would seem to me to be a most

24

peculiarly ambiguous section that should be stricken down.

25

The remainder of these provisions are such that

devote to the problem which it seems is raised in this case

2©

by the action of the Court —

21

.That problem is the problem of whether the unioris,

22

after remand, received procedural due process.

23

the Brotherhood wished an updating of the complaint and up­

24

dating of the proof? indeed it wished an opportunity to present

25

some evidence because, as the record shows, in the 1961 hearing
15

After remand

1

after the close of the State Bar’s evidence, the Brotherood

2

rested without presenting any evidence on the ground that there

was no prima facie showing of any reason for an injunction.

problem there that the findings of fact are directly contra­

Now* from the decision of the Virginia Supreme

21

Court* the Virginia State Bar made an application to this Court

22

for certiorari* as my brother indicated* which was opposed by

23

the Brotherhood and that petition was denied.

24

25

The interesting thing* I believe* and the procedural
steps in the two cases* I think, need a little consideration in
17

order to keep them straight, and 1 have found it helpful to me

2

to put in chronological order, side-by-side, the occurrences

in the Michigan case, this ease here, and in the Virginia case.

Q

What is theaaaie of the Virginia case?

A

The name of the Virginia case is exactly the

same as the Brotherhood, namelys State Bar of Virginia versus

the Brotherhood.

1 assume, Mr. Justice Black, that when you say the

18

Now» in both the Petitioner's application for

19

certiorari in this case and again in its brief in this case»

20

the — is registered that the decision of the Virginia Supreme

21

Court did not comport with the holding of this Court in this

22

Court's Brotherhood case, and that because of what occurred in

23

the case of Virginia after -the Brotherhood case» the Virginia

24

case went back to Virginia.

25

of the BEfjgenia Supreme Court decision.

It has been deprived of a review

19

Andthe reason for that»

its decision in 207 Virginia* in which was a decision con-

It considered each one of the injunction pro-

Chancery Court and the entire verbatim injunction of the
Richmond Chancery Court of 1965, is set forth in the

in

Footnote 4 in the opinion of the Virginia Supreme Court»

And

certain provisions of those injunctive paragraphs are put in
italics for emphasis and the sum and substance of the Virginia
Supreme Court’s decision was to strike from the 1965 injunction,
which is quoted in footnote 4, as being repugnant to this
Court’s holding in Brotherhood —
Q

May I ask yous was that Chancery Court injunc-

tion entered on our remand, of the case in the —
A

Yes.

Q

The proceedings in the Chancery Court then

were on our remand under Justice Black's opinion in 377 -A

Actually yes» What actually happened was that

on remand it went back to the Virginia Supreme Court»

~ I

mean remanded it down to the original Virginia Chancery Court»
Q

Right»

Mow, what of the record -- was there

a new record made in the Chancery Court?

Was that action then

on the initial record which we had considered when we had 377?

initial record was its, Mr» Maughton?

I'll accept the state­

But initial agreement of the Richmond Chancery
Court opinion in the 1965 decree which then was appeal —

5

Q

And obviously the Chancery Court thought the

6

decree it entered was consistent with our opinion on the

7

remand?

8

S
10

A

Yes? yes»

And interestingly enough„ the

Richmond Chancery Court decree — the Court's decree held that
there was nothing in this Court's opinion that prevented a

11

restraint against '‘solicitation.

12

Court decree they tried to draw a fine distinction between

13

recommendation and solicitation.

14

jects that the Virginia Supreme Court then spent considerable

IS

time in determining whether or not that distinction set forth

16

in the decree by the Chancery Court was consistent with this

17

Court's holding.

18

And so, in that Chancery

And that was one of the sub­

And the Virginia Supreme Court then came to the

19

conclusion that that entire provision should be stricken, sayinc

20

that whatever they called it: recommendation or solicitation,

21

we think that that goes beyond the constitution on the provisions

22

that are set forth in this Court's decision In the Brotherhood.

23

Justice KaracuK?) of the Virginia Supreme Court,

24

dissented and felt that this Court did not mean that in your

25

Brotherhood decision and he hopefully will find that some day
21

1

that matter will he decided and 1 think this cas© — the other |

2

interesting thing about -this case to me —

Q

Is that before us?

That is what I was about to come to*

7

Q

Is that before us?
Pardon?

May I ask it this ways would the provision

8

which was stricken by the Virginia Supreme Court*, that does

3

not appear in this Michigan proceeding?

10

A

No? it doe;s not»

11

Q

Well, then how could that provision be before

12

us for consideration?
A

3

Perhaps only inferentiaily in a determination

14

as to whether ©r not the injunctive provisions that are in

15

the lower court's injunetionhere, being exactly duplicative of

6
17
8
3
20

the final injunction in Virginia, whether or not that bears
the constitutional and the propriety and I think to that
extent. —
Q

I mean, I gather no effort was made in Michi­

gan to have the trial injunction —

21

A

Include ~

22

Q

— the Virginia Supreme Court agreed —

23

A

You are absolutely right*, Your Honor»

24

The point that I was endeavoring to cover and

25

indicate, was and is that counsel for the Petitioner here, has
22

i
i

t

steadfastly claimed that the Virginia Supreme Court interpre~

2

tation of your Brotherhood decision was improper and that they t

3

had been deprived of a review of -that decision because of the

4

fact that after the Virginia Supreme Court sent the case back

3

down to the Chancery Court and the Chancery Court then rendered \

6

its 1965 decision»

7

rendered its decision in 207 Virginia it then remanded that

8

case back down to the Chancery Court of Richmond and said?

9

here it is? take whatever proceedings you consider appropriate, i

10
11
1

z

And so the Chancery Court then entered a new
third injunctive decree exactly in the terras that the Virginia
Supreme Court said should be entered.

The Brotherhood then

made an application for leave to appeal to the Virginia

14

Supreme Court from that injunction which was denied? the

15

Virginia Supreme Court saying: now? we won't entertain this

16

because what you are? in effect? doing is attempting to appeal

17

to us from our previous decision.
And so the point is made by the Petitioner thatifc

19

has been deprived? really? of a review of its position that

20

decision of the Virginia Supreme Court is consistent with and

21

in conformity with your decision in Brotherhood,

22

:

tod then after the Virginia Supreme Court

13

18

j

Now? because of what occurred in Michigan when

23

this court accepted certiorari in the Brotherhood case? and

24

our case was then on its"way to and had landed in the Michigan

25

Supreme Court and because the issues in the Brotherhood Casa

23

j

1

were very similar to — at that time very similar to the

2

Michigan case»

3

opinion, remanded it to the Jackson Circuit Court, awaiting ~

4

to await the decision of this Court.

5

many things that occurred in Virginia after the decision of

0

this Court in Brotherhood —» it took about four years for fees®

7

things to occur in Virginia until a final injunction in

S

Virginia was finally on the books and records, then that took

0

about four years and that's tine reason why this case was

The Michigan Supreme Court, in a short

And then because of the

10

delayed the length of time that it was and why the evidence

11

up to the year 1960 is stale, according to what the Petitioner

13

14
13
13

17
?8

W
20
21

22
23
24
25

contends in this case and a decision was made after the case
came back to the Jackson Circuit Court and after the final
decree had become final a decision was made by the General
Counsel of the State Bar of Michigan, working with Mr. Kelley,
who had handled this case in collaboration with the General
Counsel of the State Bar, not to introduce any additional
evidence, but to ask the Circuit Judge, based upon the record
before — made before it, at the original hearing to enter a
decree exactly duplicative of the final decree in Virginia.
Q

So there is a tea-year gap in the ~™

A

There is practically a ten year — you are

absolutely right, Mr. Justice Harlan.
Q

And does the record indicate anything that

might have been supplied or that was suggested could have been
24

jl

supplied to fill that gap if there had been a further —

z

A

3

Now, this case presents the opportunity for this

1 don't think the record indicates that*
■

•'

4

Court to do three things which I have indicated in my brief

5

and that is, to resolve the Petitioner’s contention that the

S

Supreme Court decision — the Virginia Supreme Court’s decision|

7

did not comply with the holding of this Court in Brotherhood

&

and it also presents this Court with the opportunity to give

0
10

t© the Petitioner, the review that it claims it has been de­
prived of because of procedural problems.»

And thirdly, to

It

clarify and set at rest the concern on the part of some

12

Justices, specifically Justice Karacul(?) of the Virginia

13

Supreme Court and a large segment of the Bar —

14
15
10

11

19

20

Q

Could I ask just one more —

A

Yes.

Q

Do you know whether when was denied by the

Virginia Supreme Court to appeal to that Court from the final
judgment entered by the Richmond Chancery Court, on that denial
of the Virginia Supreme Court, did the"union attempt to get
certiorari here?
••••■■•

A

2!
22

2A
■21

know.

s'

It did not and the reasons for that,, I d© not

I can only surmise.

Mr. Naughton can undoubtedly tell

you,b ut I imagine it was because earlier, when the Virginia
[State Bar made an application for writ of certiorari- here, the
1 union opposed that.

*
25

1

2

|
Q

And the union did not cross-petition at that

time^ as far as I can see from our records»

3

A

4

Lastly^ and in these three areas that X have

No.

5

already indicated, and in this last area we agree absolutely

6

with the Petitioner8s position that this Court should speak

7

out in very determinative terms as to the length that a state

a

may go in regulating the practice of law in these areas,

9

particularly in light of a new rule ~ 2-103B5 of the new

I

10

Professional Code, the new Code of Professional Responsibility,

11

because that provision gives the specific, or sets forth the

12

specific exception, consistent with constitutional interpre­

n

tations and referring — it is specifically referred to there

14

the issues and questions existing here by reason of this

IS

Court's holding in Button and Brotherhood and Mine Workers.

16

Q

(Inaudible)

\7

A

I'm not sure just exactly how much I put in

18

|

my brief on that, but X would advise the Court that —

10

Q

You say it is not yet acted upon ~

20

A

It is not yet acted upon. We presented two of

21

*■— in Michigan it has to be adopted by the Supreme Court.

22

had a special committee of the State Bar review the Code and

23

they presented to the Board of Commissioners their recommenda­

24

tions that it be adopted, with two or three limitations, not

25

in this area.

;

We

And we had a meeting with the full court in the
26
i

1

early part of October and requested.that the Court adopt the

2

cod® as we had recommended* with two slight exceptions» not

3

material here*

4

Q

'
Is it feasible to you in our argument if you

5

could capsulize or summarize the portions of the decree where

6

there is a difference between you?
A

7

I’m not sure 'that it is * because as I under­

8

stand-

the Petitioner’s petition that every one of the pro­

9

visions generally they make the claim now that they are vague

!0

and they claim that to comply with the provisions of the decree

11

would chill their constitutional rights under the First Amend­

12

ment*

13

feelss as they have set forth in their brief* that every owe

U

of these provisions* because of the language of them* restrict

15

the full operations of the Brotherhood’s Plan* and that is the

16

very thing that we are concerned about because we feel that the

17

full operations of the plan just naturally result in solicita­

18

tion of FBLA cases.

19

trary to what the great large segments of the bar have always

20

considered as improper and we feel that each ©ne of these

21

provisions that are exactly the same and have been in effect in

22

Virginia since 1966* whan the final decree was finally laid on

23

the books.

24

rights of the members of the Brotherhood and that therefore this

25

Court should affirm the decision ©f the court below.

And I think that Counsel would forthrightly say that he

2

1 gather the Michigan Supreme Court has not

yet given you an answer as to your —

3

A

That is correct.

1 guess I didn't — I

4

meant to say that undoubtedly the reason for that is* if I may j

S

say so, we had a change of two members on the Michigan Supreme

6

Court as ©f January X* including a change in the Chief Justice*;

7

and our-new Chief Justice has voiced his feelings somewhat
.

8

strongly during our meeting with them in October* as having

9

some concern about some provisions of the code* not material

delay in making a decision on the ~ code.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY JOHN J. NAUGHTQN* ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. NAUGHTQN;

20

Q

May it please the Courts

Would you mind* Mr. Naughton?

You did not

21

cross-petition when the Virginia State Bar brought its petition

22

here; did you?

23

A

That is correct* Your Honor.

24

Q

And you did not seek certiorari here when

leave was denied to appeal from the final decree finally entered

25

28
i*

1

in the Ricmond Chancery Court?

2

A

That is correct,, also, Your Honor»

My

3

reasons for that were that I felt both of them were really not.

4

right for a decision by this Court, first because I didn91

5

believe!t was a final judgment, although I was told later it

8

wasi and then th4 second time it was technical since the court

below claimed that it was not appealable under Virginia law»

In any event, the Virginia Supreme Court inter”

pratation of this Court’s opinion seems to me to be its inter™

pretafcion and I would not presume to suggest- to this Court that

11

it’s at all definitive or binding on it.

seem to think that it was; that that Court's opinion of your

opinion is the last word»

I

I don't believe so.

I would like to mention that in regard to the

rehearing in Virginia when it came back down, there was a new

in 1962 and issued that decree, had retired»

The question as to the new Code of Professional

bar associations are willing to recognise their prospective

The question as to no chilling in Virginia.

There

is no evidence in the record, of course, as to whether thereis

13

any chilling in Virginia or not.

14

was not based on any evidence as to Virginia.

The Virginia ease, in 1962

I don't know if Your Honors recall it, but I do

IS
16

very well, that the evidence was from other States in the

17

Union.

18

At that time there was no legal counsel in Virginia.

19

counsel involved was situated in Baltimore.

20

there has been a legal counsel appointed in Virginia.

21

And there was nothing said about anything in Virginia.
The legal

Sines that time

The question as to whether the assertion .of legal
rights is chilled in Virginia is ~ well, I would suggest, in
any event, a very peculiar one and maybe only a Virginia lawyer
would know just exactly whether there was any chilling or not.
My experiences in Virginia showed that ’the recognition ©f legal
30

•

1

rights of individuals was certainly much less than Illinois.,

2

and at many times I was amazed to hear the constructions of

3

ethical canons that were promulgated in the Virginia case.

~ 4

■Ml in all, I feel this case, 'through many hearing j

3

and arguments that have gone on for a great number of years,

and it is for that reason that I would respectfully submit to

this Court that ‘the proper action here should be a reversal,
