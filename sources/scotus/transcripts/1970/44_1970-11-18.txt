Mr* Chief Justice, and way it please

This is another chapter and the final chapter in

10

the story of a criminal prosecution that commenced in 1958,

?!

This case comes here after the United States District Court, in

VI

a decision affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Hinth

13

Circuit* ordered the Stats of California to hold a new hearing

14

in the state courts on the question of whether Atchley’s con­

15

16

at his trial over objection* and a lengthy hearing at the

17

trial* and the question was reviewed and affirmed by unanimous

is whether a- State' Supreme Court decision on the merits ©£ ©

How, if the answer t© that question, is in the.

negative* then the state appellate review of federal canstitu-

2

everyone concerned*, and state appellate courts would be well

for the immediate litigation .of their constitutional arguments.

Now, by way of procedural backgrounds

Atehley was

7

convicted of murder in January 1959 after a jury trial in the

8

Superior Court for Butte County, California.' Because he was

9

sentenced to death* and incidentally that sentence was sub­

10

sequently Gemmated to life imprisonment and then commuted

11

again to allow him the possibility of parol© for which he is

12

presently eligible* his appeal to the California State Supreme

13

Court was autcsmatie.

14

That court affirmed the conviction in a unanimous

13

opinion authored by then Associate Justice Trainer, to which

18

we will refer in'some detail later.

17

point, the principal issue raised by Atehley on his state

18

appeal was whether his confession was voluntarily made.

1

The District Court refused to apply the presumption for two

reasons.

that the material facts were not fully developed.

alleged inadequacies relied on by the District Court in the

development of- the facts can be answered by an examination of

1

the staters main thrust here, and that is that they want state

2

appellate review to have the dignity of fact finding as re­

3

quired by this Court and required by Congress in the chapter

4

dealing with habeas corpus,

5

1 do not believe that state appellate review can

6

ever perform'the function of the fact finding that is required

1

by this Court and required by Congress,

8

this:

9

stantial evidence.

The first point is

In state appellate review you have a principle of sub-

How, the state says'it is en initial review, but :.t

10
11

is still an initial review based with a substantial evidence

12

rule,

13

Supreme Court

14

of confession cases.

And 1 cite for that a 1970 case by the California
that defines the scope of its appellate review

This is People vs. Randal, cited in 1 Cal 3d 943,,

15
IS

and 1 wish t© quote from page 954 of that opinion just very

17

briefly:

18

"On this appeal we accept the version of the events

19

which is most favorable to the people to the extent it is sup­

20

ported by the record and confine our review beyond such testi- ■

21

raony to facts which are uncontradicted by the people.'1

22

How, I submit. Your Honors, that by any proper

23

definition that is a substantial evidence rule, and that sub­

24

stantial evidence rule has impact on this case, because if

25

Your Honors review the language of the state court ©pinion,
24

you will find that the facts ©re essentially the facts that
were stated in the recorded confession.,
Now* appellate review *»«.
Q

You suggest they were different from the facts

which Travers testified to
A

independently?

There were material differences that are re­

ferred to in the brief. Your Honor.

However, 2 state, the

point in comparing state appellate review versus a fact finding
process which is what we believe is required en habeas corpus,
that this is an example of how it works.

The state picks up

in its opinion those facts which are most favorable t© the
people, assuming of course that there has been a conviction.
Now, you combine that substantial evidence rule
with a harmless error rule on appeal, and this: is exactly what
happened to Ms:. Atchley in this case.

The California Supreme-

Court said he didn't have a lawyer, that was error for the
judge to stop that testimony, that it was harmless error.

So

you have a substantial evidence rule, you have a harmless
error rule., and of course you have the fact also that the
appellate courts have no facility for taking evidence.
G

bet me see if l get -» I ara net sure I under­

stand the substance of your argument.

Let me project this

into an assumption that this case went back to review in that

1 am responding to the state's contention that the state of

7

minations in the district court,

8

That is what 1 am replying

And what! am stating are the reasons why state appellate

Now, 1 believe this Court has said the same thing

10

It said when facts are1 important, ap­

14

there is going to be examination into the constitutionality

of convictions, there has to be the fact finding process s©

that matters that are extraneous to the record can foe brought

BJow, Yoar Honors,

there is another element to the

case which we think is significant and is important, and that
is the inducement underlying this confession.

There is the

fact that the reason why Mr, Travers was talking to Mr.
Atchley was that he needed facts £c?r purposes of insurance
coverage,, set out- on page 200, and this is a portion of the
transcribed conversation between Travers and AtcMey.
Mr. Travers says,

"Bay,

he proceeds with his interrogation of Mr. Atcfcley.
Again,
see,

on page 102 of the record, Travers says,

100 percent as far as the policy.

”l

1 am almost positive.

So this Court has said many times that a confession cannot be
the product of any inducement at all, and I think here,
Honor*

that the inducement is very specific — insurance

money.
Now, what consequences Should flow from all of
this -Q

The consequences.

Your Honor,

that we think should

flev? from 'all of this are two:

We first of all respectfully

submit that because ©£ the denial of counsel in this case,

3

that this confession should be determined to fce involuntary

a new trial.

14

How, at the very least,’ Your Honor,, because of the

procedural inequities in the state court hearing on a confes­

and that Atchley should be given the evidenciary hearing,

Yes, but 1 think* Your Honors that that is

that is what this Court's decision in Fay vs» Hoia and
