ARGUMENT OF VICTOR RABXNOWITZ, ESQ. ON BEHALF

6

OF APPELLANTS

7

MR. RABIN0WXW3: May it please the court.

S

This case, like the others on the calendar this week,

9

is here for the third time and like the others it involves a

10

common question concerning the propriety of a federal injunc­

11

tion, in some cases a declaratory judgement, against a pending

12

state criminal prosecution.

13

ially and perhaps exclusively to that problem.

14

problem of the constitutionality of the state law has been

15

briefed, it has been argued twice and .in the time available to

16

me, I may not get to it. Nor will I restate the facts except

17

to call to the attention of the court two things which 1 think

18

are of considerable importance.

19

no abstention problem at all in this case,

20

in the Epton case has passed upon the statute, has given an

21

up to date reading of the statute, and we therefore must as­

22

sume that the state court will apply the same reading to this

23

case.

24

through the procedure of getting a state court interpretation

25

of the statute, and I do not understand that either the

I am going to address myself init­

In the first place, there is

There is nothing to abstain for.

3

The companion

The state court

We have already gone

1

Attorney General or the District Attorney argues that we should

2

abstain. The second point that 1 would like to make is that

3

this is a multi-count, indictment in addition to several counts

4

of the indictment which are under attack here, there are a

5

large number of other counts here, some fifteen or twenty

6

of them which allege substantive crimes and conspiracy to. com­

7

mit substantive crimes.

8
9

Crimes of arson,' of riot, of possession of guns, of the
possession of explosives, conspiracy to commit arson, all those

10

are in the indictment and in our opinion give the state all

It

of the protection that it needs.

12

arguments a question has been raised by the Bench as to why

13

these cases have not proceeded, in view of the fact that there

14

was no injunction issued by the Three Judge Court. And it has

15

been explained to the Court that they have not proceeded

16

because an Assistant District Attorney entered into a stip­

17

ulation this w&® the Cispl&mttlon §iws by the District Attor­

18

ney, an Assistant District Attorney entered into a stipulation

Id-

in .which he agreed that he would not proceed with the prosecu­

On each of the previous

20

tion until this case had been finally determined because then

21

rio one thought that tt would take so long to finally determine

22

it.

23
24
25

And I might say theit efforts on the p rt of the District
Attorney to relieve himself of that stipulation have thusfar
been unsuccessful, he has made efforts in the Federal District
4

i

Court.

Z

the substantive crimes here. If the District Attorney had

3

wished to proceed on the substantive crimes they could have

4

been tried, and the appeals concluded and probably the sen-

S

tences served* if they had been found guilty* before we had

6

gotten to this point.'

7

1

might say that stipulation has nothing to do with

I think that it might be appropriate to just say a few

8

words of history here* not at the moment the history of 1983*

9

but the history of the power of the Federal Court to enjoin

10

state criminal proceedings.

11

browski* for seventy-five years prior to Dombrowskiat least

12

the Federal Courts enjoined the threatened enforcement of ~

13

unconstitutional laws. This was not a doctrine that was born

14

in 1965. I c!onafe know when it started, but in 1897* in Smythe

IS

against Ames* the United States District Court enjoined the

is

prosecution of a state criminal law. In Ex Parte Young* of

17

course* this same thing happened. In Kullax against Reich*

18

in 1950*. Chief Justice* then Justice* Hughes said

19

court of .equity has no jurisdiction" --

That is not an invention of Dam-

"While a

20

ft

You can’t cover the microphone.

21

A

I'm sorry. "While a court of equity* generally speak­

22

ing* has no jurisdiction over the prosecution of crimes of

23

misdemeanors, equitable jurisdiction exists under unconstitu­

24

tional enactments.

25

is essential to the safeguarding of property."

When the prevention of such prosecutions

1

In the absence of ah adequate remedy at law, and in Harris
against Thompson in 1923, this court, repeating in effect that
language, went on to say that "the plaintiffs are not obliged
to take the risk of prosecution, fines, and imprisonments and
loss of property in order to secure an adjudication of their
rights."
Then came Douglas against Jeannette» I suggest that Doug­

8

las against Jeanette was & sport, and it happened primarily

9

of course, because on the same day, as we all know, this Court

10

issued its declaratory judgement in the Murdock case, holding

1?

the same statute unconstitutional,and it appeared that ah

12

injunction under those circumstances would be unnecessary,

13

But the fact was, that as of Douglas against Jeannette we find

14

this Court giving much more protection to property rights

15

than it gave to First Amendment rights, despite the contrary

10

history of this Court, through the famous footnote Four in the

17

Caroline Products and Thomas against Collins and that whole

18

line of cases still consistently applied,by this Court which

19

has pointed to the fact that they need more protection, quicker

20

protection, than property rights, and which in fact has given

21

that protection.

22

Douglas against Jeannette and Dorabrowski this rule was not

23

observed in the specific problem of securing an injunction.

24
25

Except that somehow, in this area, between

Then Dombrowski came along and I submit that it put Doug­
las against Jeannette in its proper place and I am not now

?

referring, to the abstention aspects of the Dornbrowski case

2

beaause as I say there is no abstention issue in this case,

3

but I am referring to the availability of injunctive relief

4

to stop the enforcement of a state criminal prosecution. In

5

the period prior to Dornbrowski while this problem of an in­

6

junction remedy was being worked out a parallel development

7

in terms of the substantive rule of Baggett against Bullitt

8

produced the Dornbrowski decision and as I read Dornbrowski

9

the Court would have been unanimous on this case in that there

10

is no abstention problem and as Iread the dissent in the Dom-

11

browski case it is based exclusively on abstention.

12

The Dornbrowski rule has turned out to be a very powerful

13

weapon in protecting civil liberties and First Amendment rights,.

14

And it is ever so much more important now and has been for the

15

past fifteea or twenty years, that is the problem of the pro­

IS

tection of First .Amendment rights,, much more important than it

17

ever was in t'hvj S’!in the last five or six years in which

18

the Dornbrowski remedy has been available, the technique, the

19

remedial device provided by Dornbrowski has been of inestim­

20

able value in protecting First Amendment rights which always

21

in our country need and will probably continue to need full

22

protection.

v

23

The issue here, relates to the application of the doc­

24

trine,. I think the doctrine of Ex Parte Young and the doctrine

25

of Dornbrowski, to pending criminal prosecutions* as distinguished
7

1

from criminal prosecutions that are not pending but are merely

2

threatened.

3

quite illogical.

Now in Substantive terms, the distinction seems
The injury to the plaintiff is exactly the

4

same, the interference in a substantive sense with state pro­

5

cesses is exactly the same.

'

0

It is often impossible for an individual to forsee a

7

criminal prosecution and I think the remarks by Mr. Reid in

8

the case that was just argued make it difficult for a poten­

9

tial defendant who has not yet been arrested, he is faced with

10

the problem that we are all faced with here today. Last w ek

11

I argued a case in the Court of Appeals in the Second Circuit,

12

in which I argued an alleged violation of New York State Flag

13

Statute.

U

ed and who had seen arrests around him on all sides through­

15

out New York State for specific violations of the Flag Statutes

10

and who had a flag like that and who wished to fly it should

17

be entitled to an injunction and the Attorney General of the

18

State of New York came and said "He9s too early. He hasn't

19

been arrested yet,''

20

I argued that a man whose neighbors had been arrest­

So we have a situation in which either you are too early

21

or too late. Either you have no standing, or you are barred

22

by 2283. Now, of eouuse, there are cases where as

23

some sort of peculiar procedural situation as in Dombrowski

24

itself there happens to be a moTnent in between the threat of

25

prosecution and the actual arrest but that does not happen in
8

a result of

1

the normal case and it's really the extraordinary case in

2

which it does happen.

3

us don't like, namely the race to the courthouse door to see

4

who can get in there first, whether we can come before the

5

state prosecution or after the state prosecution and it seems

6

to me that this results in a totally unsatisfactory situation.

And so we have the thing that all of

MR» RABIKOWITZ:

10

All 1 know was that there was an indictment.

Oh,

there was a great deal of publicity at

the time.
Mow, let me get to the question of the extension of

17

the extension of this doctrine to pending criminal cases.

are confronted of course with this question of 22830

13

Vie

I might say that the District Court in this case

20

jumped right over the threshold*

21

ation to what we have referred to as a threshold problem*

22

got right into the constitutionality of the statute.

23

that the statute was constitutional and thus avoided any neces­

24

sity of considering this problem at a 11,

25

They didn’t give any consider­
They

They felt

22830 of course» presents a problem which we think is

11

?

met by the fact that we argue that Section 3.983 of the Civil

2

Eights Law of 17—1870 and 71, specifically intended to pro­

3

vide an additional exception to 2283, and the statute itself

4

makes no distinction between' pending cases and. cases which are

5

not yet pending and it seems hardly likely that the Congress

6

of 1871 was tremendously concerned over the problem of the

7

Federal Government stepping in and interferring with state

8

proceduresB

9

As a matter of fact, the legislative history of that

10

^ct which have been discussed in a number of Law Review articles

II

“«such as cited in my Brief—the Rutgers Law Review, the Pennsyl

12

vanis Law Review and elsewhere—! can°t go into it now, of

13

course—it seems to us makes it clear that what Congress was

14

addressing itself to was the very specific problem of abuses

by State Courts as well as by other State agencies.,

suggestion that. Congress intended to permit injunctions to

n

be applied before State prosecution occurred rather than after

18

State prosecution occurs is certainly no where suggested in

19

the legislative history at all*

And the

And I would like to point out, and Mr* Justice Mar­

21

shall mentioned this at the last argument, that in the series

22

of laws that were passed after the Civil War0 Congress provided

23

for another example of stepping in and—giving the Federal

24

Courts an opportunity to step into a State Court proceedings

25

right in the middle of the trial, not merely after an indict12

?

situation^ and gave the Federal Courts under some circumstances,

3

which may be limited but nevertheless they do exist, circum­

4

stances in which a State Court could"-a Federal Court could

to go through so far as this case is concerned „

there would be no point in oral argument anyhow la reviewing

And X am not--some say X am not very much concerned.,

15

but it isn°t my job to be concerned i I don°t—X suggest that

1®

the Courts need not be excessively concerned over this problem*

17

Ey hypothesis these cases come before three™judge courts, and

18

at the point that 2 apply™™! think it was Mr* Rude in the

19

arguments fee£ore-«the three™judge court include the Court of

20

the—a judge of the Court of Appeals and the possibility that

21

injunctions will be scattered far and wide on trivial pretext

22

X think is a relatively minor one»

23

Certainly, 1 do think that much of the problem can

24

be solved by a proper hammering out of proper abstention rules

25

which will see to it that lawyers do- not come into the Federal
14

1

Courts prematurely and that the possibility of flooding the

2

Federal Criminal Courts every time somebody is arrested for

a

disorderly conduct charge under a statute that somebody claims

4

is unconstitutional can be prevented by, as X say, proper
