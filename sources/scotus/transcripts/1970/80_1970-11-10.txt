MR. McCONNELL:

We will hear arguments now

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

;he Court :
I appear here on behalf of the Zenith Radio Corporation
die petitioner in this case.
The case comes here by way of certiorari to review and

12

ill of the Court below, Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which

13

•acated an award of damages in favor of Zenith Radio against

14

;azeltine Research, Inc., the respondent.

15

rere $6,297,391, which covered and resulted in a damage award and

16

udgment of $19,077,173.

17

The single damages

This is the second time this case has
been before this
/

18

ourfc in certiorari and under the present case.

I believe that

19

t is necessary for me to briefly review the prior proceedings.

20

On November of 1957 the respondent sued the petitioner

21

n the United States District Court in Chicago for the infringe-

22

ent of an electronics patent.

23

setting out the patent was invalid and that it was misused

24

jecause its counterpart was placed in a patent pool in Canada

25

The petitioner filed an answer,

;nown as Canadian Radio Patents Ltd.

2

!

On May 22nd of 1963 the petitioner filed a counterclaii

2

under the antitrust laws setting out that they had been inter­

3

fered with in its business in attempting to export radio and telcl

4

vision sets in the United States and the Canadian markets.

5

business had been serious damaged and they asked for treble

6

damages.

Its

On a trial, the trial court found that Zenith had bean

1
8

damaged and in the Canadian market had been damaged to the extent

9

of over $6 million, and on April 5th, 1965 entered a judgment in

10

favor of the petitioner and against the respondent in that amount,

11

of money.

12

After findings had been made and after the court — a

13

year after the case had been tried, the Court entered its find­

14

ings and conclusions against the contentions of the respondent.

15

The respondent appearing with new counsel attempted to bring

16

into the case tv/o new defenses, affirmative defenses so called,

17

namely, an attempt to plead the statute of limitations and an

18

attempt to bring in a release which had been executed in a prior

19

proceeding against RCA and General Electric and Western Electric,

20

a proceeding to which the respondent was not a party.

21

22
23
24
25

Q

Have those issues not been raised in any way in

the trial itself?
A

Mo, these issues have not been raised in the

trial itself, because no pleadings of the affirmative were ever
made at the time of the trial.

And the first time they appeared
3

1

was a year after the case had been tried, and the proof had been

2

closed.

3

The current court refused to reopen its findings and

4

conclusion so far as the Canadian damage case was concerned, and

5

affirmed its judgment.

6

Canadian damage award on the ground that it said that there was

7

no fact of damage shown by the proof in the case.

On appeal the Court below reversed the

3

The case then came here by certiorari and this Court

9

reversed the Court below on the Canadian damage issue and held

10

that there was abundant proof of the fact of damage and held that

11

the case should be sent back and remanded for further proceedings

12

in accord with the opinion of this Court.
Now I want to quote one paragraph from this Court's

13
14

prior opinion, because it seems to me it really summarizes the

15

whole case as it existed at that time.

16

prior opinion:

This Court said in its

"We also conclude that the record evidence is suffi­

17
18

cient to support a finding of damage resulting from events occurring

19

after the beginning of the damage period.

20

conceded the continuation of the pobl before the District Court,

21

and it appears sufficiently clear that throughout this time Zenith

22

was deprived of what always had been refused it -- a license on

2.3

pool patents permitting it to sell American-made merchandise in

24

Canada. *

25

*

*

*

*

IIRI frankly

*

"Here, Zenith was denied a valuable license and

4

1

submitted testimony that without the license it had encountered

2

distribution difficulties which prevented its securing a share

3

of the market comparable to that which it had enjoyed in the

4

United States, and which its business proficiency, demonstrated

5

in the United States, dictated it should have obtained in Canada

6

CRPL was an established organization with a long history of

7

successfully excluding imported merchandise; and in view of its

8

continued existence during the damage period, the injury alleged

9

by Zenith was precisely the type of loss that the claimed vio­
lations of the antitrust laws would be likely to cause.

10

The

-

trial court was entitled to infer from this circumstantial evi­

11
12

dence that the necessary causal relation between the pool8s con­

'

13
14

duct and the claimed damage existed."
Now the claimed damage was a measure of damages which

15

has been approved by every cotirt that has dealt with it here in

16

this case, including the Court below, was a comparison between

17

what Zenith made in the way of profit in the American market

18

against comparable competition to which it had in Canada.

19

during the same period of time, in the period that is that we

20

were comparing, what Zenith could do in an open market as compared

2!

with compared with what it could do in an absolutely closed and

22

restricted market.

23

And

That computation showed that the best that Zenith could

24

do in the damage period, which is a definite four-year period

25

from May 22, 1959 to June 1, 1963— the best that Zenith could
5

I

do was 3 percent.

2

think, to 5 percent.

3

faced with the opposition of the pool.

4

Well, there was one year that it went up, I
But it started at 3 and it ended at 3,

In the United States, on the other hand, it had 16 per­

5

cent of the radio and television market, so transposing the profit'

6

on that volume of business, we reach the computation of the

7

amount of the damages.

8
9

Now the only thing before this Court today is the amount
of petitioner's damages.

This Court has already held that the

10

facts of damage have been proved and has concluded the issue

11

as between these parties by a decision which is res adjudicata

12

and cannot be in any way attacked.

13

So we have a very narrow issue here, and that is was

14

the proof sufficient here to establish the amount of the peti­

15

tioner's damages?

18

Court's mandate as permitting it to re-examine as it the statute

17

of limitations defense and the release defense were already in

18

the case, to re-examine what effect those two defenses might have

19

on the amount of petitioner's damages.

20

On the remand the Court below construed this

And it paraphrased part of this Court's opinion.

I

21

think the Court —- I can't quote it exactly, but the substance

22

of it was this Court said that since the damage amount was com­

23

puted by assuming at the beginning of the four-year damage period

24

Zenith had a mature market, which the evidence shows it would

25

have had in the absence of the conspiracy.

6

There is evidence

I

to that fact, not denied.

2

of the damage which was allowed must have arisen from acts,

3

overt acts or causative acts, which occurred prior to the damage

4

period.

5

that any damages caused by overt acts prior to the damage period

6

which could be traced bade to shew that they caused the.actual

7

damage, that that couldn't be considered on a damage award in—

S

the face of the plea of the statute of limitations and also in

s

the face of a plea of relief.

Since it assumed that, than some part

And taking that as a basis, the Court below then said

10

Now there is a question of labor here, but t ara not

11

going to argue that here this morning, because our ease is so

12

clear on the merits that it seems to me that it is diverting and

13

it gives substance to defens© which it is our position are abso­

14

lutely irrelevant and have no merit whatsoever on this considera­

15

tion.

16

It is our position and it is our submission that only

17

four years of damages were ever claimed, that only four years of

18

damages were ever awarded, and that the only damages which were

19

awarded were profits which had been lost by Zenith in that four-

20

year damage period.

21

Now my opponent

defined the issue in this way, and

22

I think I had better take their word for it, because it is a

23

pretty good definition of what this issue is.

24

brief, they say;

25

At page 62 of their

"Similarly, the decision of the Court of Appeals was

7
i

1

not that, as a matter of discretion, the trial court should

2

have granted a new trial»

3

held that the trial court had committed errors of law (namely,

4

the failure to give the proper effect to the statute of limita­

5

tions and the release defenses} and that to correct those errors

6

of law, the taking of additional evidence on the issue of the

7

amount of recoverable damages is necessary."

8
9
10

n

On the contrary, the Court of Appeals

Mow, it is apparent if there was no error of lav/ in the
District Court's refusal to entertain those defenses, there is
no possible basis for the grant of a new trial by the Court below.
Now it is our contention that since none of the peti­

12

tioner's damages accrued or came into being until the damage

13

period, it is absolutely irrelevant whether the causative act

14

originated at some previous time or whether it traced back by

15

some sort of proof how much of the award was due to this or that,

16

that happened prior to the damage award.

17

There is nothing in the statute of limitations \zhich

18

is applicable to this case which bars recovery on damages which

19

accrued in the four-year period.

20

is very specific —- there isn't any ambiguity about it at all;

21

Any acts to enforce any cause of action under Sections 15 or

22

15(a) of this title shall be forever barred unless commence

23

within four years after the cause of action accrues.

24
25

Section 4(b) provides, and it

The Court below interpolated into that statute the
following words.

It said the law with respect to the statute
8

1

of limitations in Section 15(b) of the" Clayton Act is that the

2

period commences to run from the last overt act of the conspiracy.

3

It says nothing like that in this statute.

It is a

4

complete reading into the Act of something which isn't there and

5

this Court said, in Radovich against National Football League,

6

that it was the province of the court to construe the statute as

7

it was and not read into it •— it should not

add requirements

And there is no congressioAaJ

10

authority whatever for reading into this very clear statute of

11

limitations the words which the Court below_ did.
Now that bring us to when did this cause of action

12

13

accrue?

14

cause of action until damage has ensued which is actionable..

15

That is when your cause of damage accrues and that is admitted

16

at pages 41 and 42 of the respondent's brief.

17

In a civil suit unde:r the antitrust

laws there is no

lost profits.

19

period and there is no way in which it could sue for a loss of

20

profits before the profits had been lost.

21

time when it lost its profits, and all of its proof was based

22

on the computation which, by the way, was never denied, no testi

23

mony against it, as to how much profit was lost during a par­

24

ticular four-year damage period.

25

It hadn't lost profits until the four-year damage

It had to await the

The Court below and ray opponent say that the statute
3

i

of limitations must run from the overt act which caused the loss

2

of profits»

3

let’s see where that leaves us.

That means that if any acts which cause these losses

4

of profits occurred prior to this damage period, Zenith couldn’t

5

have sued for them then»

6

it got down to the time when it had lost profits, it couldn't

7

sue for the overt act because they are barred by statute of limi­

8

tations and the whole argument obviously just proves too much,

9

and is contrary to the statute»

It hadn’t lost any profits»

And when

Now bear in mind that we are dealing here with a con­

10
11

tinuing conspiracy,,

This Court found that this conspiracy

12

existed all during the damage period and found that specifically

13

in its opinion, and that we are dealing with constant invasions

14

of the rights during a time we are trying to compete in Canada

15

during this four-year period»
Now could we have sued for those profits prior to the

16
1?

damage period?

18

was adduced here and see that is impossible.

19

to show — and this Court on another branch of this case held -—

20

that in order to show facts of damage, you have got. to show that

21

you are equipped to compete, that you are willing and able to

22

compete in the foreign markets from which you claim to be excluded

23

and that, absent the conspiracy, you,would have been there com­

24

peting .

25

Well, all we have to do is look at the proof that
First, Zenith had

8

compete, and that you ware prevented from competing.

5

So how could you make proof of that kind

care where it originated.

17

when this pool originated, if they had a causative effect that

18

19

cause of action until they did originate in damages.

20

the did originate in damages, it was only during the four-year

21

period and the statute does not bar, and the Act so says.

22

So it was utterly impossible for Zenith to have

The Act says that it starts when the cause of action

25

So much for the statute of limitations.
11

We say it is

1

absolutely and utterly irrelevant even it had properly gotten

2

into the case, which we do not agree»

3

So I want to turn now to the release point.

4

There was a .release given in this record, but it didn6':

5

have anything to do with the respondent in this case.

6

release was in a prior proceeding between Zenith, RCA, Western

7

Electric and General Electric.

3

by this pool since 1926.

9

United States District Court and we settled the case, and we

That

We had been excluded continuously

We sued them in a counterclaim in the

10

settled it with the release given September 1957, a year and a

11

half before this damage period started.

12

Now the Court below had a little difficulty with this,

13

and understandably so.

14

the Court in Tague:

15

"THE COURT:

IS

"MR. KAYSER:

17

The following colloquy occurred between

When was the RCA release signed?
It was signed, as I understand it, on

September 27, 1957.
"THE COURT;

18

As I understand it, they are only claiming

19

according to your chart from May 22nd of 1959 to May 22 of.

20

1963»

21

"MR. KAYSER;

Yes, Your Honor, that is very true.

22

"THE COURT;

I am not sufficiently astute today to

23

understand your theory so that I can understand how this release

24

in s57 had anything to do with what occurred in ’59 to !63."

25

Now it is our position that if the Court below can
12

!

construe a release executed in 1957 to bar a cause of action

2

which did not arise and did not exist until 1959, then this

3

release is construed in a manner to relieve a future cause of

4

action of the antitrust laws which would be illegal, invalid and

5

against public policy, because the public hasn’t entered in the

6

enforcement of the treble damage provisions of the antitrust

1

laws.

3
9

There are other reasons why this release is not valid
and they are discussed in the brief.

So it is our submission

10

that there is no relevance in either of these defenses.

Vi

if they had been in the case, there was nothing to them.

12

they never got into the case, and this Court referred to them as

13

belatedly raised in its prior opinion.

14

Nov/ I have one further point.

Even
And

Bear in mind this Court

15

has already found the facts against them, the only question is

16

the amount.

17

I am going back to the Eastman Kodak case.

This Court

18

has held that once the facts of damage are established, mere

19

uncertainty as to amount will not vitiate an award of damages

20

because the uncertainty which we are talking about, and we are

21

talking about it here.

22

mature market, to begin with, and it is speculative whether e

23

would have had and, therefore, it is uncertain and therefore our

24

whole damage computation is uncertain and the damages awarded

25

are uncertain.

;

The claim is that we did not have a
1

But throughout the briefs and throughout the
13
\

1

arguments, the respondent has taken the position that they have

2

been in this pool since, well, 20 years and they have contributed

3

along with their co-conspirators to our inability to compete in

4

any way in Canada.

5

couldn't get a mature market and the reason we didn't have a

6

mature market was because they had prevented it.

7

to apply that argument to this case means that the uncertainty,

8

if there is an uncertainty and we do not believe there is in

Of course we had no mature market.

proof.

In such circumstances juries are allowed to act

Any other rule would enable the wrongdoer

to profit

21

by his wrongdoing at the expense of his victims.

22

Court said it in another way by saying, in the absence of more

precise proof, the best evidence that can be produced is all

24

wrong because "the most elementary conception of justice and

25

public policy require that the wrongdoer

2

And here throughout the brief these gentlemen say. they

have created the uncertainty because they kept us out of the

5

Now, as I say, this Court has held the fact of damages

What did the Court below say?

ARGUMENT OF VICTOR- P. KAYSER, ESQ.

2.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

MR. KAYSER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:

S

I propose to spend my half-hour primarily answering

6

the assertions made by Zenith counsel, but I would like, first,

7

to give a brief background against which this discussion may be

8

conducted.

8

As Zenith counsel stated correctly, the issue here

10

involves the amount of damages recoverable by Zenith and Zenith's

11

right to recover some damages is not in dispute. . This Court

12

on the prior appeal in the Court of Appeals to recognise on

13

remand that Zenith is entitled to recover those damages caused

14

by the Canadian Patent Pool taking place during the four-year

15

period of May 22, 1959 to May 22, 1963.

16

But the question which remains is whether Zenith is

17

entitled to recover those damages suffered during the four-year

18

period that as a result of acts of the Canadian pool taking

10

place prior to the four-year period.

20

which the Canadian pool is supposed to have interfered with

Mr. Justice', I think-not.

As a matter of fact,

This was on the record.

And I suggest that the record speaks from the

In that connection it should be pointed out that the
Court also, based on the same motion, did grant us partial relief

10

in the case of England and Australia and permitted the limiting

11

to the mainland U. S.

12

the claim there was completely disposed of.

The result of that, of course, was that

13

We had a single motion directed to all of these mat­

14

ters which we submitted to the trial court should be permitted

15

by the fact that, among others, the proposed judgment of $39

16

million was so devastating and would have been so fatal, that

17

in the interest of justice the trial court in its discretion

IS

should permit these things to be done.

19

Now this Court in its first opinion pointed out spe­

20

cifically that the damages in Canada had been based on the assump­

21

tion not only that there had been wrongful conduct during the

22

period, but on the assumption that there had been wrongful con­

23

duct in the prior years, 1926 to 1959, and that Zenith had been

24

damaged by those prior acts.

25

In fact, the opinion here specifically pointed out that
18

!

Zenith assented that it should have had 16 percent of the Canadian

2

television, market at the beginning of the period, of the four-

3

year period, that is; that Zenith claimed it should have had a

4

13 percent share of the radio market but for pool activities,

5

instead of which it had 3 percent of television and 4 percent of

6

radio.

7

of the damage, I submit, is a large portion, was necessarily

8

based on the pre-damage period conduct accrued during the period

9

1926 to 1959.

10

Arid accordingly, as this Court point out, the portion

And on remand —* pursuant to remand of this Court,

11

the Court of Appeals did hold that the defenses of release and

12

limitations were in the case, and did hold that they barred the

13

recovery of damages suffered during the damage period by reason

14

of these pre-damage period and pre-release period acts and that,

15

accordingly, that the case should go back to the trial court so

16

that there might be excluded that portion of the original award

17
IS
19
20

which was based on the proved damage period conduct and so that
the award might be limited fco damages resulting from conduct
occurring during the damage period.
Q

May I ask you if there is somewhere — this is

21

not the only problem dealing with damages in this case?

22

are some indications that there might be some further limitations

23

on what caused the damages during the damage period.

could recover the difference between 15 percent that it would

If that factor is established on remand, yes.

Well, as 1 see the litigation up to now, the

market at the beginning of the period and 4 percent as to tele­

13

television, which was when they began in the U. S. market, that

the evidence indicates that prima facie in that span of years

under those conditions there could have been the same in Canada

as in the United States.

Q

The record does indicate that.

There really is quite a bit left over from your

standpoint in this case.

22

firmly say, Mr. Justice, that that would be seriously in conten­

tion, because Zenith’s own proof -- let’s take television.

Zenith's own proof is that starting in the United States when

25

they started as a new competitor, that by 1959 -- after ten yearsi

they had gotten IS percent in the Canadian market, their own

2

proof is that starting in fee United States in the 820s.in radio,

3

over a span of 30 years, it took them that long to get up to 13

percent of the radio market, and in Canada the conditions are

5

different, and I most firmly submit that to think that Zenith

could have started in 1953 with its 3 percent share of the tele­

vision market and 4 percent

Mr. Justice, your question, I think that begs

18

some additional questions that must be asked.

that on the facts of this record — there are no facts in this

record on which you could assume based on 3 percent at the beginning

21

Yes, but I said let's assume that we could prove

that they would have had 10 percent in the fourth year.

24

A

15
16

Mr. Justice, I don't read the Court of Appeals

opinion that way.

17

Q

If you did, you wouldn't agree with it?

18

A

No, sir, because we are bound by the opinion of

19

this Court, and this Court has ruled, as I understand it, that —-

20

Q

Oh, 'I'm sorry to have used your time.

21

A

Well now, I would now like to go briefly to the

22

point of the release which Zenith's counsel suggests, No. 1, can

23

have no application? and, No. 2, if so, would involve a violation

24

of law.

25

First off, how can this release executed in 1957 have
23

\

I

any conceivable bearing on damages which were suffered after

z

19S7?

3

briefs, that this release by its terms relased all past, present

4

and future claims, causes of action, et cetera, which might have

S

resulted or might bear results from acts and conducts prior to

6

the release, namely, up to the day of these presents -- the usual

7

language.

8
9

The answer is, of course, as we have pointed out in our

Now Zenith argued that if this release has such an
effect, it is against public policy and in its brief cited the

10

Fox Midwest Theatres case, which came out of the Eighth Circuit,

11

Now that case held that it would be against public policy

12

the violation of the Sherman Act to permit a release which

13

covered future damages based on future violations of the Sherman

14

Act,

sukK

15

So that obviously would be an encouragement to and,

18

in fact, fco some extent a license for future violations<f the

17

Sherman Act.

18

But in this case all we have here and what we do have

19

here is a release which covers damages suffered in the future

20

by reason of past acts.

21

more, it purports to cover nothing more,

22

It covers that and it covers nothing

And it must be quite obvious that when Zenith asserts

23

that it was the conduct of the pool over the period from 1926

24

to. May 22", 1959 that prevented Zenith from building up to this

25

16 and 14 percent share of the market, which it would have enjoyed
24

1

during this period,, it must he quite obvious, I submit, that the

2

major portion of that conduct between 1925 and 1959, which

3

interfered with the proved buildup, had occurred prior to Septem--

4

ber 27, 1957.

S
6

7

in fact, Zenith’s evidence in this case was largely
testimony and documents as concerning earlier affairs.
I will say, finally, on the subject of the releases,

8

that Zenith itself has admitted to the trial court that HRI,

9

Hazeltine Research, has the benefit of the release, because when

10

we brought up the question at the reopening hearing, the court

U

asked, "What is your reply to his contention that the 1957

12

release also released Haseltine from anything prior to the date

13

of the x'Qlease?"

14

"ANSWER:

Well, any damages which had accrued prior

15

to 1957, if they were joint tort nature, which we allege they

13

were, would be released,

17

prior to 19 ---

But we are not asking for damages
\

18

"THE COURT:

Then you have answered my question,"

19

And then Zenith counsel went on to argue this conten- j

20

tion about future damages that would be contrary to public policy

21

and so forth,

22

alleged joint tort seeker is clear.

But the application of the release to HRI as an

23

Q

Is HRI less than a 49 percent owned subsidiary?

24

A

If that less than 49 percent subsidiary was an

25

alleged co-conspirator, it would apply.

35

Q

1

2

.

3

Even though the release applied to the subsidiary

and define "subsidiaries" as being only subsidiaries which are
owned 49- percent or more?
A

4

Well, Mr. Justice, as we pointed out in our brief,

5

this release more- than the subject matter of the suit, but it

6

was-a general release»

7

Q

Yes.

8

A

And it was for that reason apparently to file a

9

general release to the parents and subsidiaries.
Q

10

Yes, for what purpose could they possibly have

11

wanted to define subsidiaries if they meant to include all sub­

12

sidiaries?

13

14
15
16

A

In order feo define them to include them under the

general release, but absent', as he mentioned, if they were, in
fact, co-conspiractors, they would have the benefit.
Itow as to the subject of the statute of limitations

17

and the contention that it does not apply on the ground Zenith

18

asserts that no cause of action accrued until after the actual

19

damages were suffered, I submit that Zenith's argument flies__

20

directly in the face of long-established legal principles, not

21

only in the application in the antitrust cases, but generally

22
23
24

25

In the law.
Those principles are that a cause of action accrues
when it can first be brought, and in the case of Sherman Act
violations, as well as in other law, the action can be brought
26

!

and in the case of the Sherman Act violations --where the

2

wrongful conduct has an. impact on the business of the plaintiffs

3

or on his property.

4

his rights.

That, is, when there has been an invasion of

And at that time he had a cause of action, not only

5
6

for the damages he has already .suffered, but for the damages

7

he is likely to suffer and is reasonably likely to suffer in the

8

future as the result of that impact.
Now Zenith's counsel has referred to the act of con­

9
10

stant invasions, namely, that there are rather admittedly impact

1!

of wrongful conduct during the period.

12

is that Zenith would therefore have additional causes of action

13

for the damages caused during the damage period conduct, and in

14

fact that is what the Court of Appeals ruled and this Court

15

recognized, that Zenith does have a cause of action fpr damages

16

caused during the period.

17

the previous acts, it has its cause of action for past and future

18

damages more than four years ago, it did not sue and, therefore,

19

its claim based on its prior conduct is barred.

But all that amounts to

But as to the damages resulting from

Now I have said that this is a well-settled principle, j

20
21

We have cited a number of antitrust cases in our briefs in this

22

in Figures 40 and 41 of our opening brief, on pages 10 to 13 of

23

our reply.

m

reply brief, the Dairy Foods case, which also enunciated the

25

principle that you can recover future damages without waiting for

I would like to add a case that Zenith cited in its

27

'

I She time to pass during which those damages would be suffered.
2

This is like saying to a personal injury plaintiff,

3

who has lost a leg and can no longer pursue his livelihood, "Oh,

4

no, you may not sue for future loss of

5

year after year as you lose

6

year after year."

7

income. You must wait

the income and you must file suit

That, I submit to this Court, is not the law, and what

8

Zenith is really doing here is attempting to subvert the effect

9

of Section 4 of the Clayton

Act, which says the cause ofaction

10

must be brought within four

years from the time it accrues or

11

it is barred.

12

By attempting a redefinition of "cause of action" which,

13

in fact, would fly right in the face, of the statute itself,

14

because the law has long been settled and was so at the time

15

of the passage of Section 4(v) that when there is an impact,

16

you can sue both for damages already suffered and for those

17
18
19
20

2?
22
23
24
25

which are reasonably anticipated to be suffered in the future.
Now 1 think thatipossibly the best way to summarise this
point is to read two sentences from the Momand case, which is
an antitrust case.

This is a quotation from the District Court.

The case was affirmed by the First Circuit and certiorari denied
in 1949; and I read:
"Each time the plaintiff's interest is invaded by an
act of the defendants, he has a new cause of action.

For that

particular invasion he is at once entitled to recover as damages
28

1

not only for the injuries he suffers at once, but also for

2

those he will suffer in the future from that particular invasion■

3

including what he has suffered during and will suffer after the

4

trial."
This is quoting Lawlor v. Loewe, an opinion by Mr.

5
6

Justice Holmes in 235 U.S.
Now,, finally, I would like to go to this contention

7
8

that has been made as to uncertainty as to damages and somehow

9

it is suggested that our position is contrary to the Bigelow

10

case.
Now the Bigelow case has said that if it is established

u
12

that some damages have been suffered by reason of unlawful acts

13

and if there is an uncertainty as to whether those damages

14

result from unlawful conduct or perhaps other conduct, but that

15

uncertainty will be resolved against the defendant who may have

m

created the uncertainty.
But we submit that in this case there is no uncertainty,

17
18

that the amount of damages resulting from the damage period

19

conduct is ascertainable.

£0

tion of the award must necessarily result from pre-damage period

21

conduct.

22

assumption of a 16 percent of the television when, in fact, the

This Court itself has said that a por­

It is pointed out that the award xvas based on the

share at the beginning of the period was 3 percent; that it is
24

obviously that 13 percent out of that initial 16 percent claim

25

resulted from pre-damage period conduct.
29

The same is true on

i

radio, where the assumed share was 13 and the actual share was

z

4.

3

pre-damage period conduct.

4

It is obvious that 9/15ths of the original share traces to
It could be traced to nothing else.

The way this thing would be resolved would be to

5

start on the remand with a 3 percent share of the television and

8

a 4 percent share of radio, putting the relevant estimates, make

7

a determination to marketing experts, and dfoer experts, whoever

8

is qualified to determine what Zenith could have achieved during

S

the four years in a free market setting of its actual. 3 and 4

10

percent share.

Then apply those percentages to volume, by

11

profits and subtract the share and the profits that Zenith

12

actually achieved, and the difference would be clearly and ascer-

13

tainably with reasonable certainty, the difference would be

14

Zenith's damages.

15

And we submit that under this stats of facts when so

16

great a portion of this $19 million, this devastating $19 mil­

17

lion, is obviously based on pre-damage period conduct -- we

18

submit that the clear road to be followed here is to hand the

19

case back to the Court below so that there may be a determination,

20

so that there may be a fixing of the amount that Zenith actually

2!

suffered based on conduct during the four-year period, and then

22

bring the litigation to an end.
