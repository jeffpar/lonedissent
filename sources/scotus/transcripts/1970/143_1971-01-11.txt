ORAL ARGUMENT BY NIKI Z. SCHWARTS , ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

S
9

MR. SCHWARTZs

the Courts

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the issue in this case is the constitutionality

10

©f Section 533;01(9) of the Ordinances of the City of Euclid;

11

Ohio, which makes it unlawful for any suspicious person to be

12

within the municipality and Part E definining a suspicious

13

person as any person who wanders about the streets ©r other

14

public ways or who is found abroad at late or unusual hours of

IS

the night without any visible or lawful business and does not

16

give a satisfactory account of himself.

17

Now; this question arises on the following facts?

18

©n April 19; 1967 an off-duty Euclid policeman who was a part-

IS

time job as a patrolman or watchman at a very large apartment

20

complex in the City ©f Euclid; had his concern alerted- by

21

noticing a car driving slowly in the parking lot of the apart­

22

ment ©ompless at a speed he estimated at three fe© five miles an

23

hour; with the lights off.

24

Secondly, he testified that his suspicion was

25

aroused by the“fact that the car stepped and discharged a

2

1

“colored female" and he knew that no colored female lived in

z

that apartment complex and this aroused his suspicion,

3

The third thing he testified t© that aroused his

4

suspicion was that after discharging the female, the ear?

5

which was ultimately determined to be driven by the Appellant

6

or defendant here, James Palmer? turned

1

out to the street? and parked,

8
9

or

its lights? pulled

Upon approaching the car the officer testified
that he noticed the Appellant speaking over a Citisen?s Band

10

©r two-way radio.

It

Palmer to get out of the can put him up against the car?

iZ

demanded his license? driver8s license? which was furnished?

13

and asked him to explain what he was doing there.

14

that he had discharged the friend.

IS
16

As a result of these three things he asked

He explained

Further inquiry about the identity and purpose of
the friend resulted in no response.

t7

Q

Does the record show that —

18

A

The record shows that following the un­

19

satisfactory response as far as the officer was concerned , he

20

marched the defendant into the building at gunpoint? called

21

for assistance from the police department and a search was

22

conducted of the entire premises and the girl was not found.

23

Subsequently the defendant finally agreed to state where he

24

thought that the girl had gone? the- specific apartment number.

25

They went up to that

apartment, but by this time it was 2s30
3

1

or 2; 35, 3s®Q o8clock in the morning and knocked on the door

2

of that apartment, the police officer-

3

door and was asked was a colored female on the premises and

4

upon being informed that the answer was no, the officers left,

5

continuing to search on the premises for the girl»

6
7

Q

10

Boss the record shew any burglary incidents

in the area in the immediate past?

8
9

And a male answered th«

A

The record shows that there were no reports

of any incident of any kind but there was not ever any report
of any crime having been committed that night»

11

After Palmer was stopped, frisked, detained,

12

arrested, searched, taken to the police station and interro­

13

gated, the stolen car sheet checked, it was determined that

14

absolutely no substantive offense had ever occurred, and that

15

there was not a scintilla ef evidence of any having ever

18

occurred.

17
18
19

And subsequently. Palmer was charged with being a
suspicious person, in violation ©f this section.
How, at first blush, perhaps, this case seems t©

20

be another in a line of cases testing police investigatory

21

powers such as individual liberty, many of which incredibly

22

arise out ©f the Cleveland area? Mapp versus Ohio, Beck versus

23

Ohio and Terry versus Ohio,

24

But there is one crucial difference in this casei-

25

In those cases the issue was s conceded the guilty man ©r woman

4

1!

go free in order to serve sortie interest of constitutional

2

liberty»
Here the issue is

3

%

shall aa innocent man be

4

convicted and incarcerated in order to serve some punitive

5

interest in law enforcement or maintenance ©£ order?

6

am prepared to demonstrate that this ordinance on its face and

7

as applied, does great violence -'to hallowed constitutional

8

rights with.no justification of necessity for law enforcement

9

or maintenance of order»

And 1

10

Q

Well, what sentence did this man get?

11

A

The man was sentenced to pay a $59 fin© and

12

costs or to serve 30 day® in the Cuyahoga County jail»

13

Q

Has he served this —

14

A

DJoy by ©rd£r of Mr» Justice Stewart, the

35

serving of sentence has been stayed and originally pending

18

filing of a jurisdictional statement and now pending the out­

17

come ©f the case»
There are three fundamental tasks on this ordinance

18
19

on its face, and as applied and time perhaps will not permit

20

me to deal with all of them as fully as I might wish»
The first is vagueness»

21

The rule ©f void for

22

vagueness, serves three primarily interests; that of furnish­

23

ing notice to those who wish to conform their behavior t© law

24

so that they might know what they dmay do and what they may

25

not»

The second purpose is limiting the discretion of law

5

1

enforcement officers of courts and juries within some des­

2

cribed standards in order to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory

3

enforcement

o

and the third is to prevent the ordinance from

4
3

6

being'construed too broadly to encompass or trsneh upon con­
stitutionally protected conduct,

7

Q

Sdke

what?

8

A

liiks

what?

Q

Yes ®

10

In this particular instance?

doctrine presents itself most often in terms ©£ First Amendment
activity ®
In this particular instance the constitutionally

14

15

17
'18
29

20
21

protected conduct involved is the right to liberty without ,
except upon articulable suspicion or articulable facts that
constitute, in effect, reasonable suspicion under Terry to
justify a stop and frisk;- probable cause to believe that a
crime is being coEsaitted in order to justify an arrest and
proof beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime h&d been com­
mitted in order to justify a conviction and incarceration
pursuant to that conviction•
And s© there is a liberty ©f movement her®, free­

25

Frequently the

dom of mov@raej.it, which is one of the constitutionally protected
interests involved.
ests

Other constitutionally protected inter­

are the right t© be free ©f discriminatory enforcement®

6

1

These interests are served, these purposes are served by the

z

vagueness doctrine.

3

Now, usually when a case comes here on the issue

4

of vagueness, the whole case turns on the meaning of a single

5

word or phrase, as we just saw in the last case,.

6

question was: what dees 15annoying," mean and is that suffi­

7

ciently precise*

8
9

The real

Here we °ve got four ©r five phrases which indi­
vidually each is vague? together they are impossible.

10

“Wanders ;" what is “wanders?”

11

judicial opinions that there are at least three competing

12

interpretations of wander.

13

What does that mean?

We see in

In the Ohio Supreme Court decision in Columbus

14

versus D@ Long you have the majority striking down a statute

i5

on the ground that "wander," by virtue of being defined as

16

aimless motion without any purpose, cannot include a criminal'

n

purpose, therefore it is limited to innocent conduct and

18

therefore the ordinance was held unconstitutional.

19

On the other hand, the dissent says that within

20

the context, that wander must necessarily wean or b© limited

2!

to a criminal purpose, wandering for a criminal purpose oraa

22

wrongful purpose and therefore the ordinance should be upheld.

23

In Seattle versus Drew the Court struck down a

24

similar ordinance because it said ^wander," can mean either

25

innocent ©r culpable conduct.

And in thatsense, being to©
1

j

i

vague is too broad, as well.

z

"Abroad at late or unusual hours of night without

3

visible ©r lawful business," is simply, it seems to me, a

4

nighttime version of wandering and without visible and lawful

5

business begs the question as to what it is thatss prohibited

6

and what it is that3s protected.
Is Professor Wright9® walking the streets at

7
8

midnight visible or unlawful business when he has no defined

9

purpose?
Then the question we some to, the most incredibly

10

II

vague of all phrases, and the one that renders the ordinance

12

most defective, in my opinions' "Does not-give satisfactory

13

account of himself."

14

demand it?

15

must they b© satisfied?

16

satisfactory?

17

Satisfactory account to whom?

Who must be satisfied?

Who may

Over what period of time

Is a credible but untrue account

Is a true but incredible account satisfactory?

Ife8s purely subjective? it purely just throws ©pen

18

the door feo the police officer in the first instanceg the

19

judge and/or jury in the second instance, to decide whether

20

it*s satisfactory, and even to decide who must be satisfied.

21

Is the issue at trial whether the officer was satisfied or is

22

•the issue whether the judge and jury are satisfied?

23

How, the same principles, same defects in here in

24

discussing this in terms ©f its propensity for arbitrary and

25

discriminatory enforcements ordinarily a statute which is
8

1

inordinately ’/ague simply by virtue of its vagueness , facili»

2

tabes arbitrary? or discriminatory enforcement,

3

explicitly it authorises arbitrary or subjective enforcement.

4

And it is what the Court has previously described in other

5

cases, as government by a raoment-to-moment opinion of the

6

police officer on the'beat.

1

But here,

The law as its s drafted on its face can3t possibly

8

b® indiscriminately enforced across the board.

9

ceivable that that could be done.

It is Incon­

The Law Review literates©

10

is replete with discriminatory enforcement of these kinds of

11

ordinances, against Hippies, Yippies, beatniks, bums, people

12

©f unconventional dress, behavior, length of hair and so on

13

against Black persons.

Arid

What would you say, counsel,-about 'fee

14

IS

arguments that they have increasingly in the case of speed,

16

reasonable speed undor the circumstances.

17

to discriminatory enforcement against certain categories of

18

peonle?

19

This is ~

20

A

Is that not subject

Well, Ohio has exactly such speed laws and

21

of casxsse, any law could be subjected to discriminatory en­

22

forcement in the sense ©£ arrest and prosection and s© on,

23

On the other hand, in dealing with the question of was the

24

spaed reasonable under the circumstances, there are objective

25

indicia that on© can look at to determine reasonableness.
3

For

t

examples how many cars were on the highway?

2

weather conditions?

3

much access was there?

4

lights?

7

What were the

What was the width of the highway?

How

©a a.-side road were there traffic

So# all of these things are objective indicia
that one can look at t© determine reasonableness»
Q

Coming back to the disposition of those

8

cases is it not true as a practical matter that invariably

9

©r almost invariably the evidence consists of the evidence of

10

the arresting officer and the accused person?

11

A

More often than not that is the case.

Much as you have in this type of situation.

Each of them is susceptible of abuse.

We don't have to speculate on the capacity for

20

arbitrary enforcement here by# in terms of the other cases

21

©f the Law Review article? we have right in this very case an

22

example of race being used as a factor.

23

argue that race is almost an element to the offense here#

24

because it's one of the key factors in why we are — fch©

still have an ordinance which the fundamental purpose is

flies in the face of a number of important constitutional

principles.

I would rely, in the interest

10

of time? primarily on my brief on-that point ©r 1 would like

11

to deal with the citation of the Appellee to the Miranda

This is not a Miranda case.

Well, could I ask you% under this ordinance if

someone is found on the streets late at nights 2s30, 3s00

in the morning, and the officer asked him what he was doing

2

and he says,, "Hone of your business , " and remains quiet, does

all the state need t© do t© prove its case under this ordinance

is to show those facts t he was found late at night on the

5

streets and he remained mute®

the State’s burden?

7

A

Is that the entire esstent of

That’s a good question which I have an

8

impossible time answering because the thing is so vague.

9

assume that in the Euclid Municipal Court one could get a

10

conviction on those facts, but I ~

11
12

13
14

Q

Yes, but the ordinance says that the fact

of being found on the street without lawful business®

How

does the State satisfy its burden of showing that somebody is
on the street without lawful business?

15

A

Without visible or lawful business.

16

Q

Well, X know, but that just means lawful

18

A

X don’t know how w© can just read that —

19

Q

Well, it doesn’t mean visible and lawful;

20

it says visible ©r lawful.

23

wasn’t anything visible about -- he had no business that was

24

25

A

Wow, how about, lawful?
Well, you see, if the "visible” weren’t in
14

1

there and the State had the burden of showing of shewing that

2

he was engaging in unlawful conduct it would b© a vastly

different ordinance.

The argument for this kind of a law historically

21

has been Fourth Amendment concepts of probable cause and Fourth

myself that whatever the outcome of this hearing that the fact

that at most under Terry would justify stop and frisk.
