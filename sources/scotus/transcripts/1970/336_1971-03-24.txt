ORAL ARGUMENT BY CHARLES R. B. KIRK * ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

7

9

We will hear arguments

MR. KIRK:

Thank you* Mr. Chief Justice* and may

it please the Court:

10

The central question in this case is: was the

11

Respondent O'Neil given the opportunity to cross-examine a

12

co-defendant, Runnels* who in a confession implicated O'Neil?

13

Or* to perhaps phrase it as the Court of Appeals

14
13

did: was there an opportunity for effective cross-examination?
I think* central to the determination of this

16

question .is an examination of the purpose of confrontation and

17

as this Court recently said in Dutton v„ Evans* and I quote;

13

"The decisions of this Court make it clear that the admission

19

of the confrontation, clause

20

is to advance a practical concern

for the accuracy of the truth-determining process in criminal

21

trials by assuring that the fcryer of fact has a satisfactory

22

basis for evaluating the truth of a prior statement."

23

Now* before looking to the options available

24

when the confessing co-defendant takes the stand* as Mr.

23

Runnels did in this case* let's see what this case does not
2

I

involve.

This case does not involve a pointer-type issue

z

vrhere the witness never takes the stand and is never cross-

3

examined,, never available.

4

vrhere the co-defendant takes the stand, but by invoking the

5

privilege against self-incrimination, removed himself from

S

any possibility of either direct or cross-examination.

This is not a Doug las-type issue,,

7

So, when the —

remain silent?

10

A

Mr. Runnels?

11

Q

Yes.

12

A

Wo, Your Honor; hevoluntarilytestified.

13

He was on the stand at his own request and own defense.
Q

14
15

Did Runnels, on any ground, attempt to

Respondent’s counsel simply passed up his

opportunity to cross-examine?
A

IS

That is my viewpoint, Your Honor; he had

i?

the full opportunity.

IS

he did not.
Q

25

Well, they were both quoting an alibi,

weren’t they?
A

21

22

He could have done so if he wanted, but

Yes, they ware, indeed,

Mr.Justice

B

Brennan.
Q

Well, why would Respondent’s counsel want

to cross-examine?
A

Well, this is part of my point; I think

Q

2

Well/ but why would he?

Why would he want

to —• their defen.se was alibi; wasn't it?

3

A

4

That's right.

Thisis precisely ray point.

5

I think that the Respondent confuses the technique of cross-

6

examination with the purpose of cross-examination.

7

technique is assuredly to make the fellow develop some kind of

8

conflict if you want to, or prove inconsistency if you want

9

to.

The

But if that man is on your side — if that man is on

your side and fully supporting your

10

Q

11

W

Well, ordinarily, I take it, if a witness

12

is testifying in a way that helps the State against you that

13

obviously you want to cross-examine him.

14

testifying in a way which doesn't help the State, but helps

13

you, why would you want to cross-examine him?

But if he is

18

A

That's part of the issue here.

17

Q

Well, I suppose you could get him to tell

his story again.

13
19

A

You certainly can —

20

Q

You could gat him to tell this story in

21

your favor again.

You may call it cross-examination, but you

22

can still get him to tell precisely the same story again;
no, I didn3t make the statement —

23

A

24

This is —■ Mr. Justice White, this is

precisely what happened when the State prosecutor •

25

4

j

I

cross-examined Mr. Runnels.

2

didn’t you talk to Officer Traphagen?

And

And Mr. Runnels said: "Sure I did."

3

Didn’t Office Traphagen ask you if you did

4
5

He went back and said: well,

this and so? “Sure he did."

6

And didn’t you say he did?

7

"No, I didn’t; one I found out that I had a

S

right to an attorney I clammed up and didn’t say anything

9

further."
And then the prosecutor said: well, didn't you.

10
11

really do this?

Didn't you commit this crime?

And he said:

12

"No; I didn't do any such thing."

13

This was — these options were all available to

14

Mr. O’Neil*3 counsel.

15

bring out the fact -- because he couldn’t bring out the fact

16

that maybe O'Neil was — had some kind of motive

17

kind of dislike — maybe Runnels had some kind of dislike for

18

O’Nail because O’Neil had sort of a hold on him, as Officer

19

Traphagen had told Mr. Runnels.
But, he could have gotten Runnels

25

He complains that perhaps he couldn’t

had some

he could

Runnels would have said,

"No. "
Would your dislike for O'Neil have caused you to
make this statement?
I like O’Neil.

"I didn’t make any statement at all;

We didn’t do it."
5

1

This was availablep but it. wasn’t done.

2

Now, so I think that you have really pointed out

3

perhaps the ultimate question, the bare question here; why

4

should O'Neil have atcached the statement at all?

5

examination is a tool, but you don't use tools unwisely.

6

don't use tools if you don't need tools, and they didn't need

7

tools.

You

Now, I myself, have wondered how the Court of

8
9

Cross-

Appeals cotild say there wasn't any effective cross-examination,

10

or wasn't

11

has proffered a few explanations in his brief before this

12

Court and we have touched on some of them with our answers.

13

Namely: he says that you can only heive effective cross-

14

examination with a witness if he can bring out qualifications

IS

in his testimony or other things.

16

— the Court of Appeals didn't say, and Mr. O'Neil

Again, this is confusing the technique with the

17

purpose of cross-examination.

1 mentioned again that there is

18

nopoint to proba Runnels' anger.

19

if he was angry at him, but he didn't.

20

probe the statement for omissions or errors or inconsistencies

21

Well, you don't want to.

22

want than what Runnels gave- him on the stand, as the dissenting

23

judge below pointed out: the best O'Neil could hope for would

24

be for Runnels to testify

25

that O'Neil did not commit the crime.

He could have asked Runnels

only that, but h€ said —

This was available for exploration.

In

15

fact, this is one of the points that was brought out? and in

13

the closing arguments remember they brought in one witness who

17

said: "Well, I talked to Officer Traphagen and he said that he

m

was going to give Runnels five to ten years if he told me

10

something and one year to life if he didn't, so I told Runnels

20

and then Runnels confessed."
This kind of thing was all available for explora™

21

tion, but it wasn't done.

22

Q

23

Let me ask you this question, Mr. Kirk:

suppose the State had not called Runnels at all — let me get

the setting now of the cross-examination.

It makes nc difference, so far as 1 can see, who called him

15

and atthe same time as a witness for Mr. O'Neil.

Q

Well, it makes a difference in terms of the

16

key points of the testimony and whether he is being cross-

17

examined or not; doesn't it?

defendant as opposed to .cross-examination by the prosecutor.
Q

Respondent here than he gave, as it appears in this record now"

A

1 don't think so.

— well he could have said:
Q

I said that but I was beaten,"

And that's one of the reasons why it was

Mr. Justice Brennan's suggestion that there was no occasion
to cross-examine him.
A

Because he had the perfect — the most

favorable results from his direct cross-examination come out.
"I didn't say it

mid we weren’t there."

This was the

ultimate kind of response you could get from a witness as to
these particular facts.

This is exactly what O’Neil got.

There was no reason to cross-examine.
Nov; —
Q

Welly did I ask you: this was pre-Bruton,

A

This was, Your Honor.

Q

,And that if this co-defendant had never

taken the stand there would have been a Bruton there?
A

Yesj yes there is.

Q

But he did take the stand?

A

He did take the stand.

Q

Since there was availability for cross-

examination, if the trial were held today I suppose the

prosecution, after Runnels had taken the stand, was available

I don11 have a great deal to add but I would like

12

to briefly touch on the last argument which Respondent has

14

categorised as a pro forma argument.

15

the concept of exhaustion.

16

Respondent; it's certainly not pro forma to us in this case.

17

It's & rather short argument because there is not really much

ORAL ARGUMENT BY JAMES S. CAMPBELL, ESQ.

25

Thank you, Mr. Kirk.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
11

MR. CAMPBELL;

I

z

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court;
This case involvas evidence in an oral, un­

3
4

recorded statement reportedly made by a suspect during cus­

5

todial interrogation; a statement that accuses another person

6

of participation in a crime; a statement reported in court

7

by an investigating officer who conducted the interrogation *
This is unreliable evidence, one of the most

8
9
10
11

12

13
14

15
IS
17
!8

unreliable forms of evidence known to the law, yet it is
also —
Q

I"m not sure 1 have that clear.

Which is

the unreliable evidence?
A

The unreliable evidence is the evidence

of this statement, this alleged statement.
Q

Well, you are going to develop for us why

that8s unreliable?
A

Yes5 yes, I will, Mr. Chief Justice.

This evidence, in addition to being unreliable,

19

was also devastating; its colloquy incriminating evidence, as

20

this Court described it in Bruton. This unreliability and this

21

22
23
24
23

devastating impact are the two most important factors to keep
in mind in determining weather OsNe±l in this case had an
adequate opportunity to cross-examine his accuser.
In other kinds of cases involving other kinds of
evidence, dying declarations, spontaneous declarations,
12

documentary evidence of one kind or another, business records,

1

2

.

it may well be that something less than the fullest and most

3

effective cross-examination would suffice, to satisfy the

4

requirements of the confrontation clause.

5

evidence as to which a defendant is entitled to have the true

6

and full measure of cross-examination, it is the highly un­

7

reliable or powerfully incriminating evidence which went

8

before the jury which convicted O'Neil.

But if there is any

Now, O'Neil did not have a. fair and effective

9
10

opportunity to cross-examine all the witnesses against him or

1!

the alleged maker of this devastating out-of-court accusation»

12

flatly denied having made the statement.

13

Fully effective examination of an out-of-court

14

examination of this type can occur only whan the witness to

15
16

17
18

whom the statement is attributed, affirms this statement in
court so that the accused can probe its truthfulness by all
the many lines of attack that we include under the head of
cross-examination.
This principle is established in cases governed

19
20
21

by the decisions of this Court in Douglas against Alabama and
Bruton against the United States,.
Q

22
23
24
25

Supposing Runnels had testified: "Yes, I

did make the statement as reported by the officer.

What would

you say then?
A

Ifhe admitted the genuineness of the

statement?

Q

That isn't anything that's anybody's fault?

situation,

I see you posing the case wheye the witness —
Q

I5m just trying to recall my hypothetical

If Runnels had got on the stand in his own

defense, and said? "Yes, I made the statement, that was
attributed to me by thepolice officer."

11

A

12

which may change the result.

13

what I said then? what I said was not true."

14

"And furthermore what I said was true."
Q

15

Well, then there would be two further facts

Or does he say,

Well, I mean he just said he made the

16

statement.

17

by counsel for O'Neil?

18

Does he then say: "I deny nov?

Then did he expose himself to cross-examination

A

Well, to the extent that he admits making

19

the statement but denies the content of it.

20

genuine, but it wasn't true, then you have the situation .

2\

in which the United States, as amicus curiae in Green,"said

22

there would be effective cross-examination in this case.

23

The United States, in Green, took the position that where

24

there is a flat denial of the statement, as to genuineness and

25

Now, he says it's

truthfulness there can be no effective cross-examination.
14

1

That's our case here,

A further case is the

2

one where the witness admits the genuineness of the statement

3

but denies its truthfulness.,

4

Green case, but still not too Green.

That is somewhat more like the

The third situation is the one where the witness

affirms making the statement and he affirms the truthfulness

of what's contained in

point the only — again, not our case — the only remaining

10

argument against the admission of the statement under those

11

circumstances would simply be a straight due process argument,

14

required as a constitutional matter.

15

there.

Then he essentially incor­
And at that

despite this fact the evidence is still so unreliable

Q

Would you agree that very narrowly the

16

purpose of cross-examination is to persuade the jury that one

17

of the witnesses is not telling the truth or that his memory

18

is faulty or that for some other reason his testimony should

19

not ba accepted.

20

cross-examination?

21

A

Would that generally be the purpose of

Well, the purpose of cross — I would

22

hesitate, Mr. Chief Justice, to try to encapsulate here for

23

you all the purposes of cross-examination as --

24

Q

But those are three of the purposes that —

25

A

Yes; these are certainly among the purposes ,
15

1

One is to attack the credibility of the witness through the

2

various devices which are encompassed under the head of —
Q

3

If a witness is called and gives direct

4

examination which has — just has no real impact on the par­

5

ticular case at all, just not a bit harmful — doesn't help;

6

doesn't hurt; just largely irrelevant.

7

usually not elect simply to let that witness alone?

8

A

That is correct.

9

probably not cross-examine.

10

Q

Does a wise lawyer

That8s correct.

He would

examine Runnels.

Then why would you think he made that

I think he made that decision because he

decision?

17
18

Yes; he -- O'Neil's counsel did not cross-

realised he could not fully effectively cross-examine the
really damaging evidence in this case by injecting questions
to Runnels.

The most that he could hope to do would be to

elicit from Runnels a curaula.tive repetition of the denial of
the statement which Runnels had already made on examination by
his own counsel.
The notion that this denial —
Q

How was Runnels5 testimony damaging?
16

1

A

The denial which Runnels offered in Court

2

was of some very., very limited assistance to the defense.

3

was a necessary part of the. defense.

4

defendcmt also had to deny making this statement if he's going

5

to plead not guilty; a ste.fcemant which incriminates him as

6

well cis his co-defendant.

7

It

Obviously the co-

But the evidence that we9re concerned about, the

S

evidence, the accusation which has not been cross-examined,

9

anC. which couldn't be cross-examined by addressing a question

m

to Runnels, is this out-of-court, in-custody accusation which

ii

was reported, this alleged a.ccusation that's reported in

12

court through the testimony of the police officer.

13

14

Q

Isn't the proper way to attack that by

cross-examining the officer when he testifies about it?

15

A

No;

this —

16

Q

Was

it permitted?

17

A

18

There was an opportunity to cross-

examine the officer.

13

Q

20

A

21

Yes.

Was

he cross-examined?

He was not questioned; he was not cross-

examined by O'Neil's counsel.

22

Q

And you say that was a denial of —

I do not.

No, I do not; I simply say that that

22

That just simply

For example in this case; Runnels5 self-interest

the results that cross-examination might have achieved.

They couldn't produce the statement;

That'a rights they should not have put it in

under the circumstances; that's right, without allowing the

accused his right of confrontation or cross-examination;

18

that's correct.

19

20
21

Q

1 still have trouble with this right of cross-

examination and confrontation.
A

Well, if I may, the procedure that should b®

22

followed in cases like this is the procedure that Mr. Justice

23

White outlined in his dissent in Bruton and the one of the

24

American Bar Association on minimum standards for criminal

25

justice is recommended and it's the recommendation, in fact,

28

1

that was mads before Bruton, and that is where a defendant is

2

incriminated by a co-defendantSs out-of-court statement and

3

a motion to saver is made, as it was in this case, that the

4

prosecutor must elect between severance or nonuse of the con­

S

fession or effective dilution of the references to the inj

criminated defendant, the other defendant in the confession.

6

And this is the procedure which should have been,

7
8

followed in this case.

9

is not followed that the constitutional error could be cured

It may happen - that if the procedure

10

under other circumstances, as I noted.

11

where the co-defendant pleads and then takes the stand and

12

admits making the statement.• That3s the unusual case.

13

As, for example,

The normal procedure which the position urged by

14

Respondeat would mandate is the one that this"Court laid out

15

in Bruton.

16

Q

Did the American Bar Report say that was a

17

constitutional requirement or merely a good idea ©f how to

18

handle the problem?

19

A

20
21

constitutional problem.
If I may turn briefly to the question of harmless

error and exhaustion.

23

as to constitutional error to b© harmless must be harmless

I think that the discussion indicates>that it is a

I'm now going to reiterate

3

what I have said in my brief.

out one thing, and that is to refer the Court to the closing

arguments, because contrary to the Respondent's assertion,

the prosecutor did not heavily rely upon this statement by

belonged to the eye witness.

police officers started driving behind them.

Runnels9 confession as corroborating this identification by

idle eyewitness, but he heavily emphasized all these facts,

14

pinning Mr. Runnels and Mr. O'Neil, pinning the crime on

them and further, he pointed out the absurdity, the patent

absurdity of their defense that some strange man, this phantom

suddenly, while riding along they discovered this gun and
