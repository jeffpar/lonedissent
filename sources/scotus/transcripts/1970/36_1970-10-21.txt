OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR* !€ftRD#

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

8

Court, this matter comes before you this morning in a write of

9

certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the

10

Seventh Circuit*

It was commends in the United States District

ii

Court for the Northern District of Indiana, Hammond Division,

12

within appro::.1.irately two weeks of this Court’s decisions in

13

the Marchdtfci and Grosso cases.
The petition was brought under 28 U.S.C. 2255 by Mr.

14
15

Mackey, requesting a new trial from a conviction of willful

16

evasion of income taxes.

17

that during the course of the income tax evasion ferial, the

13

government had admitted into evidence 60 wagering tax returns

19

which under the Harihetti-Gros3e decisions were coerced,

20

taken from the defendant, in violation of his privilege against

21

s e1 £-£ncrimioation.

The gravamen of the petition was

The petition was pending for approximately eight

22

months.

The jury then considered the

case for approximately 43 hours, over the period of five days,
brought in a judgment off conviction, which was affirmed by
the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals and a petition for writ
of certiorari thereto was denied by this court,
This case offers,, we think,
Court at this time,

two major issues t© the

They are:

Will its decisions in Marehetti-Grosso foe retro-»
actively applied to criminal cases which were tried and final­
ised prior to the date of these decisions? and, secondly —
and 1 think personally more importantly -- what is the thrust
of the privilege against self-incrimination.

is it a transac­

tional privilege or is it a testimonial privilege,

and dees

the privilege, as specifically written into the Fifth Amend­
ment, mean exactly what it says?
Wow, as far as the retroactivity part of this ease
is concerned,,

I even question the accuracy of the word

"retroactivity.11

Marehetti-Grosso were decisions of this

Court which I feel righted a wrong in the Kahriger-Lewis de­
cisions,

Marehetti-Grosso did not break any new ground.

Marehetti-Grosso said, arid I think reaffirmed and reaffirmed
as it should have reaffirmed,, that the government, the national
government, as same as the state government,, has no power to
compel testimony or compel evidence out off the mouth of a

4

1

citizen if the purpose of this compulsion is to provide evi­

2

dence to he used against him in criminal prosecution.
This Court, I think universally and constantly, has

4

held in any retroactivity case before it relative to state

5

matters that where the element of compulsion is present, where

6

statements or where confessions are taken
from a defendant
t

7

through compulsion and used against him in a criminal proceed­

8

ing, at any' time he may thereafter move for a new trial or

9

take whatever steps are necessary to afford him a new trial.

to

I think what is before the Court this morning is

11

this, is the standard which this Court has imposed upon the

12

states to be imposed upon the national government and, quite

13

frankly, upon this iourfc.

14

arisen in the state or in a state court relative to state

15

legislation, I don’t think there would be any problem in the

IS

court saying that once you find compulsion -- and I may use

17

one ox Mr. Justice Stewart’s phrases in dissent —• compulsion

18

19

is the focus of the inquiry -- once you find compulsion, once
i ■
you find a compelled statement being used against the person

20

in a criminal trial, then retroactivity or a new trial auto­

21

matically follow.

22

Q

I think if this matter would have

Would you clarify for me here just what the

23

compulsion, what compulsion are you referring to, compulsion

24

on whom to produce what consequence?

25

A

If Mr, Mackey had not filed these returns, he

could have been indicted for failure to file the returns and

could have been sentenced to the penitentiary for five years

and could have been fined $1,000 for each offense*

is the difference actually between the Sullivan case and be­

held that a return which'is required from all of the people

In the Sullivan case, the Court specifically

to

for the purposes of raising revenue certainly was not

11

sheltered by the privilege of self-incrimination.

12

Holmes then, however, suggested that if any particular part of

13

that return, any particular question in that return would tend

14

to violate the privilege, then of course the privilege could

15

be claimed in the return.

16

Grosso situation, at least as I read the two decisions and as

17

the lower courts who seem to be following it, as 1 suggested

18

read the decisions, the court held specifically that these

IS

returns were not required from a general class of people for

20

general governmental purposes.

21

specifically that these returns were required from gamblers in

22

order to provide evidence to prosecute gamblers.

thing in the exhibits.

He has the expert exhibit

In spite of the fact that there were 800 exhibits

7

8

or in excess of 800 exhibits, and that the key exhibit in the

9

net worth case is the final net worth summary by the prosecu­

10

tor, that was mentioned to the jury six times, and rightfully

11

so.

12

You would expect it.
The next amount of time, as far as any exhibits

13

were mentioned to the jury, was his wagering tax return.

14

different times the prosecutor came back to these wagering

IS

tax returns, and one of them, in effect, was very interesting.

t€

It was almost a Griffin type case, and these are set out in

17

our reply brief.

18

He said to the jury,

Four j

"if these wagering tax returns

19

are accurate, if they truly reflect the ins and the outs,

20

then they are okay.

But there is only one man that can tell

21

us that, Mr. Mackey.

Come up, waive your privilege against

22

self-incrimination and explain this."

23

Q

That was the government's theory, that the

24

monthly wagering tax returns were accurate and that they were

25

inconsistent with his income tax return, or that they were
12

1
}5
t

inaccurate and so was his income tax reutrrr?

didn't believe the "wagering tax returns, because the net

in the jury's verdict was confusion, confusion that those

10

Q

As gross receipts?

11

A

Right.

But, not taking the stand, Mr. Mackey

12

didn't have the chance of explaining this. We don't Know for

13

a fact that the jury knew these were gross receipts.

14

other words, if you add up the wagering tax returns, as

IS

Exhibit 765 did, you find an enormously greater figure of in­

come from wagering than you did on Schedule C, upon which

taxes were paid.

18

found.

Investment Company -- I can argue inferentially that he never

did, because the argument made by the prosecutor to the jury

3

to show that he was a gambler and the argument made to the

4

Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, in the appeal of the

5

original case ---> the government had admitted here that the

6

only evidence of gambling are the wagering tax returns and to

7

some extent the words “policy" or "policy wheel" in the income

8

tax return, but, again, as to the weight, given to that, in

a

the argument to the jury the prosecutor never argued that you

10

could find that this man was a gambler because of what he put

11

in his Schedule C.

12

Four times the prosecutor argued to the jury, this

13

man is a gambler because of the wagering tax returns, and they

14

so argued that in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals,

15

seems a bit of a late date to come in here and try in a sense

16

to change the facts.

17

that is the district judge, in the 2255 proceeding — the

18

district judge in the 2255 proceeding tried this case, and

19

when this petition was filed, in his opinion, he said this

20

represents a new and serious question.

21

in his memorandum opinion that these returns were put in to

22

show a likely source of ««reported income, and I think that,

23

to me, is practically decisive as far as how important these

returns were to the government on trial.

Kow, if they were important, then the Accardo case

would have taken over.

There is a specific ruling in the

prejudicial and reversible error.

7

government can have it two ways, to at one point convince the

important and must go in, and then on the appeal level say

So I just don't think the

10

they weren't very important and weren't very relevant and "we

1!

didn't really need them," because if that were the case, this

12

case should have been reversed the first time around cn the

13

issue of Accardo.
Then; we get into the nature of the privilege itself,

14
15

the transactional testimonial.

IS

because Marchetti-Grosso specifically talks about gamblers,

n

that this is not a gambling prosecution and therefore the

18

thrust of the decision should not go to this type of situa­

19

tion.

20

The government has argued that

1 think the privilege itself, no person in a crim­

21

inal prosecution should be a witness against himself answers

2£

the question.

£S
24

25

I think once the privilege is violated, and

i

this Court has specifically ruled that the privilege was
i

i

violated in the Marchetfci-Gross© situation, once the privilege
is violated, that taints the evidence.
19

I can't conceive of it

'

;

being used in another prosecution.

I can’t conceive of this

Court holding or stating that the privilege against seifi«crimination can be violated, and there are some circumstances
in which the evidence could be used in a criminal prosecution
against the witness.

That to me, in any event

„

is the begin­

ning of the -2nd of the privilege against self-incrimination.
I: you go back to the Silverthorn Lumber ease, this
Court held that the essence of a provision which prohibits the
acquisition of evidence is not only that the evidence not be
used in court but that it not be used at all.

And you get

into the Murphy vs. Waterfront Commission, a silver platter
sort of thing where the court held that if evidence be taken on
a state level in violation of the witness’ privilege against
self“incrimination, it may not be used in any manner -- in
any manner, these are the words of this Court — in a criminal
prosecution by the federal government against the witness.
The Gardner case reaffirms, X think maybe a year or
two ago, reaffirmed the Murphy vs. Waterfront Commission in
that situation.

I would like to spend a second with the

Gardner case, because I think it has some relevance to this
case.
The Gardner case was a police officer who lost his
job because he refused to surrender his privilege against
sel£»inerircination, he wouldn't sign a waiver of immunity.
year and a half l.ater this Court decided
20

the Garrity vs.

A

i

New Jersey ease, so they couldn't do that to him, couldn't
make the imposition of a penalty costly.

He then filed a peti- |

I
•! tion of reinstatement of his job, which was denied, and the
t

i case worked itself up and this Court ultimately decided that
he should gat his job back, that his privilege was violated.

In other words, in a civil matter this Court had no
if

problem with making Garrity retroactive to a set of facts that
happened a year and a half before, where a man had lost his
property, his job, if you will, because of a violation of his
privilege.

It just seems to me in a criminal matter, in a

criminal case, where a man has been convicted and a very im­
portant link to the chain of evidence needed to convict is a
, part of the conviction process that he has a right to a new
trial on the same basis that Garrity had a right to — that
I
: Gardner had a right to his job.
I
So as far as this Court I think consistently and
continuously held that once the privilege has been violated,
that the evidence cannot be used in any manner against the
witness.

It has always held this, at least the way I read tbs

cases, as far as state prosecutions are concerned.

And it

I

has always been extremely careful, in talking, particularly
i
in retroactivity cases, in talking,

j

for example, that the

Miranda Rule should be prospectively applied, that the Escobedo
|
Rule should he applied.

It has always been extremely careful

to iterate and reiterate and continually to cary'e out this
21
.1

f

exception, that where it is shewn that a statement is taken from |

2

a vitness iavolunfcarily and is used against him, then he; still
has the right at any time to avail himself of any state or

4

federal machinery for bringing this to the attention of the

12

MR. SINN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

13

Court, I should like first to set out seme additional facts

14

relating tc petitioner's conviction which we believe are essen­

15

tial to this Court’s resolution of the case.

16

As has been noted, the government proceeded on the

17

net worth method of proof.

'Under the government's proof,

18

petitioner's net worth increase during the prosecution years

19

by more than a million dollars, while he and his wife reported :

20

taxable income during those years totaling $143,000.
;

How many years are involved?

21

Q

22.

A

Five years, 1956 through 'S0, inclusive.

23

Q

About $28, 000 a year was what he was reporting,

24
25

but he came out to a million dollars at the end?
A

Well, he started out with roughly $360,000 and,
22

p
,-i*

3

according to the government's computation, had over $2.5
tail lion of assets at the end of the prosecution years.

But in

terms of taxable income that he reported, it was $143,000.

4

The principal issue at the trial did not have to do

5

with gambling, the issue was whether the government was justi­

6

fied in including in petitioner's net worth certain assets

7

which petitioner acquired in the names of corporations which he

£

controlled, in the names of friends, relatives, and even

g

fictitious parsons.

It was a long trial, and more than 80

10

witnesses testified, and the bulk of the testimony showed that !

11

petitioner had furnished the funds for the purchase of assets

12

consisting of securities, real estate, loans and mortgages,

13

paying for these assets either in currency or with cashier's

14

checks.

13

The largest transaction, which is typical, except

16

for the dollars involved related to petitioner’s acquisition of

17

stock in a fire insurance company.

IE

currency, with instructions that the stock be issued in the

19

narae of one of the corporations which he controlled.

paid an additional $98,000 in

22

controlled.

And still later he paid $15,000 in currency for

While this was the largest investment he made during!
the prosecution years, the government's proof showed that on
23

f

literally cTozena of occasions he purchased assets using cash

2

or cashier8s checks.

3

petitioner controlled was the Gibraltar Industrial Life

4

Insurance Company,, of which he was Chairman of the Board.

5

The largest of the companies which

Petitioner's basic contention at the trial in this

6

ease was that the assets he purchased, and in roost instances

1

had registered in the name of Gibraltar, actually were the

8

property of Gibraltar and therefore could not be included in

9

his net worth.

But the income tax returns that Gibraltar

10

filed shewed that the corporation operated at a loss during

11

the prosecution years and did not have sufficient capital to

12

ac [«ire the assets which petitioner paid for during those years

IS

Petitioner's sister was Gibraltar's Treasurer.

She

its books and records were paid for either in currency or

5

cashier’s checks, that corporation’s expenses were with rare

7

compass was the government’s proof that petitioner’s net

8

worth had increased during the prosecution years by substantial­

9

ly more than can be- accounted for by the taxable income

10

This, then, in brief ;

reported on his returns.

II

in addition, it was the government * s obligation

12

under the net worth method to show a likely source of addi­

13

tional taxable income that could account for the net worth

14

increase.

IS

petitioner’s income tax returns for 1956 to i960, which showed

IS

that certain of his income came from being a "policy operator"

17

and in one instance, from a "policy wheel."

18

To this end, the government introduced info evidence

I would like to correct one factual statement that

19

Mr. Ward made, and that was that defense counsel did not object

20

to the introduction into evidence of the Schedule C form.

Zl

did object upon the grounds of prejudice and the objection was

22

overruled and the income tax returns were admitted.

23

He

A second point omitted from Mr. ward's statement

24

was that in addition to the Schedule C forms which indicated

25

that petitioner was in the policy business, there was the
25

I

testimony of an Internal Revenue Service agent that in the

2

course of his investigation petitioner admitted that he was in

3

the gambling business.

4

duce petitioner’s wagering tax forms for the 60-month period

5

covered by the indictment,,

6

again, this is most important —* the objection», according to

7

Mr. ’Kardj, was based on the ground that the wagering tax forms

8

were prejudicial.

9

information disclosed in the forms could, be computed by

The government also sought to intro­

Defense counsel objected — and*

But it was also based on the ground that the

10

reference to the income tax return, that is that they showed

11

nothing more than the income tax returns themselves.

12

The government attempted to introduce the wagering

13

tax forms first during the course of the testimony of the

14

first witness, who had prepared petitioner's income tax returns.

15

These forms were not mentioned again until more than 60 wit­

16

nesses had testified regarding petitioner's cash transactions,

17

and this was during the course of testimony of petitioner's

18

secretary.

m

On both occasions, the court reserved ruling on the

20

ground that the government had not shown that the forms were

21

not merely cumulative of the information that appeared in the

22

income tax returns.

23

testified was there further mention of the wagering tax forma.

24

Defense counsel again objected to admission of the forms on

25

the ground both that they were prejudicial and cumulative of

Not until the government5s last witness

26

1

what, was in the income tax returns.

>2

Ewe the forms, which are reproduced in the Appendix j

3

which is on file with this Court, show ™~ have an entry — 1

4

ara reading from page 41 of the Appendix — the gross amount .of

5

wagers accepted during the month — page 41, Mr. Justice —

6

Q

Yes, including layoffs --

7

A

That's right, they ware involved here though,

8

so far as I ;*now, while we don't have all the forms reproduced

9

hero, I air- not aware of any layoffs or that that was in issue

50

!

in the case.
So those figures, if you add up -» if you tafce twelves

11
12

month's wagering tax forms and add up the gross receipt figuresj

13

on those twelve forms, presumably that should be the figure

14

that should go into gross receipts on Schedule e of the income

15

tax return, those, gross receipts, and that is the — the line
i

,

16

reads

'gross receipts” on Schedule G,

17

Q

Schedule C is what?

IS

il

Income from a business or profession.

19

It is

filed by an individual proprietor.

20

C

A self-employed person?

21

A

Yes, someone who is employed wouldn’t have to

22
23

j

bother with that form.
G

Mr. Ward, I thought I heard him say that this

24

form that you are referring to now, the tax on wagering, is a

25

schema ©f the federal government with the sola purpose of
2?

j
t

cing people to disclose illegal activities.

Did I hear him

correctly?

■\

1 '.believe you did. Mr. Chi el Justice, and I

0

Well,

hose to *—
the tax is 10 percent of the gross,

isn't

i tV
1

Yes,

sir.

This is the point 1 am trying to

make **•«*•
Q

This is something — this looks something like

a revenue measure, I would think.
A

The court said in Machetti and Grosso that this

ras a revenue measure but that because of the interrelationship
of the wagering tar. information that had to be furnished and
the comprehensive scheme of federal and state statutes pro­
hibiting gambling and gambling related activities,

that the

privilege \.ould be a complete defense If the forms were not
filed.
;r would like,

though,

to make the point, because I

don't think it is clear as to what the income tax return
showed', because X think that this is critical to this case.

lx x were preparing an income tax return and I had
the wagering tax forms in front of me,

I would take the twelve

forms and 1 would add up the figures from each one ami put it
down in the gross receipts line on the income tax return.
That Is not what was done here.

The figure that appears on

28

f

the income can return is substantially smaller, the gross re­

2

ceipts figure, that is, substantially smaller than the sum of

3

any twelve month's wagering tax forms.
But the reason for defense counsel’s objection was

4
»»•

not only the prejudice, it was that it was cumulative, and the

6

reason for this is that on the income tax return, in addition

If

to the gross receipts figure, there is a space for deductions

£

and one of the deductions that petitioner claimed was a deduc­

9

tion for the excise taxes paid.

In. other words, the sum of

10

the excise taxes paid for the twelve-month period appeared as a

11

deduction on the income tax return, and basically the argument

12

that was made by petitioner’s counsel at the trial was, well,

13

the jury can q.cppute tbit itself.

U

the excise tax deduction, again which is on this form if you

15

add up twelve forms, add up the deductions that show on twelve

16

forms, which is 10 percent of the gross, that figure appeared

17

on the incerne tax return as a deduction.

All it has to do is to take j

The defense counsel’s argument as to — that it

18
19

didn’t show anything more was let the jury multiply the excise

20

tax deductior» by ten and then they themselves can see what the

21

gross —

22

Q

Is this deductible?

23

h

Yes,

24

Q

The 10 percent

it is.
.excise tax on gambling is

Yes, it is.

and ifc is deductible and it'was claimed.

' *£>'

the pro judice ground that counsel objected on.

cumulative, let the jury multiply by ten and then they will

5

know that the gross receipts figure, which was only a fraction I

of the total gross receipts shown on the wagering tax forms,

7

was substantially larger.
Q

8

And s© it wasn’t only

j
He said it was j

Coaid you have made your case if you had merely

9

cofused on the deduction taken in the general tax return?
h

10

2 think,

very frankly, Mr. Chief Justice — I

II

mi speaking as a matter of hindsight — I think that the

12

summary':forms to which Mr. Ward referred earlier, this Form

13

765, which is a summary exhibit of all the wagering tax forms,

14

could have been computed by reference to the income tax returns

15

alone.
3

16

His ©rindary, Ms regular --- when you speak of

17

income tax returns, you are distinguishing it from the

18

wagering --

19

A

From the wagering tax form, the Schedule C.

20

And we have asked the government prosecutor why did you push

21

to put this in, a»3 he said why shouldn't I push, Lewis and

22

Kahriger ware on the books and this was good evidence- and it

23

highlighted the opportunities that a gambler has, since h® is

24

always dealing in cash, t© hide income.

2,5

But we had here evidence that he was a gambler from
30

l

?

the Income tax returns, the evidence of the revenue agent and

2

also the fact that this could have been computed, admittedly
not as vividly for the jury, by reference to the income tax

4

returns.

That is one of the grounds on which defense counsel

objected to admission of the evidence —

Q

And it could have been Computed by multiplying

by ten the deduction forteach of them?

h
g
10

By multiplying by ten and subtracting from the

product of that multiplication the figure•that was shown as
gross receipts on the income tax return.

n

Q

Yes.

12

But that wouldn't have accounted for ail the

income that was missing,

are right or wrong.

the income tax returns.

14

The two just

1 have examined those.

Mr. Justice White, I believe you asked the question

15

regarding that — he claims deductions for costs of supplies

16

and other deductions, but he only showed the net figure in the

17

gross receipts column on Schedule C.

18

Q

Supposing Marchetti and Grosso had been on the

19

books at the time of this prosecution, what would your posi­

20

tion be?
A

21

I think we would still be here, Mr. Justice

22

Harlan.

Our position is that at the time that these wagering

33

tax forms were filed, there was no certainty that they would

24

prove a significant link in the chain of evidence tending to

.25

convict the petitioner of income tax evasion.
32

And we say

1

this — Mr, Hard has referred to the Murphy vs, Waterfront

&•»

Commission ease., and the very broad language that was used in

3

that ease regarding any use of testimony compelled in violation!
i

4

of the privilege, and 1 would like to put a hypothetical to

j

S

the Court regarding Murphy vs. waterfront Commission which

j

6

shows, we think, despite the broad language, that there are

-

7

some limits,

8

•
Let 'i?-' suppose that a commission is convened to ex-

9

amine bribery by public officials, and I am called to testify

I©

before this commission today, October 23, and I testify that,

11

after investing my privilege and having my claim rejected and

Low, next April 15 comes and 1 have to file my in-

I

15

come tax return, if I don111 include that $5,000 in income, 1

17

would suggest that Murphy vs. Waterfront Commission doesn’t

18

necessarily resolve the question whether the privilege in that I

19

ease would bar the introduction of my prior testimony, because

j

20

the theme running through this Court’s decisions in the self-

j

21

incrimination area has been that unless it will surely prove

22

a significant link in the chain of evidence tending to con­

vict, the privilege shall not apply.

And so we say that even in the case you posited,

In ocher words„ this became seif-incriminatory

That is correct-

We couldn't have gotten these

in under Aceardo if the gross receipts figures and the tax
deduction figures tied in with the income tax returns* because
than I tld::x the argument as to prejudice — and* again* this
would be ir the discretion of the trial judge, he has to weigh
the possible effeci on the jury of the exposure of gambling
against the additional contribution that the evidence might
aa ice.
So 1 think we would have had a very difficult time
getting in the wagering tax forms had they been consistent
with the later filed income tax returns.

If was only the later!
