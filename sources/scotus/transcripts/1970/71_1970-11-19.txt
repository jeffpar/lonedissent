argument in the matter of Abate and others versus Mundfc and
others, Number 71.
ORAL ARGUMENT BY FRANK P. BARONE, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER ABATE

6

MR. BARONE:

7
8

We will now hear

Court:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Rockland Comity is located in the New York City

Metropolitan area, approximately 30 miles from New York City.
Until a decade ago it was a very small suburban
10

community," that is until the development of th® New York State
II
throughway, whereupon it experienced rapid, if not phenomenal
U
growth.

It consists of five towns and has been traditionally

O
governed by a five-man board of supervisors, each supervisor
14

being elected by one of the towns comprising the county, without
15

regard to population.
16

In 1 64 this Court rendered a historic decision in
n
the case of Reynolds against Sims and in 1 65 a resident of
m
Rockland County commenced an action in the New York State
1

Supreme Court to compel the Rockland County Board of Supervisors
20
to reapportion themselves in a manner more consistent with that
2!
decision.
22

The New York State Supreme Court referred that
23
matter to the United States District Court for the Southern
24
District of New York and as a result, in 1 66 the Board of
25
3

Supervisors of the County of Rockland were directed to re­
apportion the County of Rockland in accordance with the man­
dates of this Court and the 14th Amendment of the United
States Constitution*
The District Court further directed that a plan
of reapportionment be placed upon the ballot for the general
election of November 1966 for referendum.

This plan was

rejected* as were two subsequent plans.
In 1968* the taxpayers’ action was commenced by
Samuel J. Abate* one of the Petitioners herein,’ to have the
County of Rockland reapportion itself in accordance with the
constitutional mandates of this Honorable Court.

After several

motions and hearings, the Respondents herein were directed to
serve an answer.
Respondents simultaneously moved in the New York
State Supreme Court the usummary■judgment requesting that the
Court direct implementation of a local law providing for
weighted voting without referendum. ' The plan for weighted
voting was rejected by the court and the Respondents herein
were directed to present to the court a proposed plan of reapportionment with all deliberate speed.
The Board of Supervisors had, previous to this point,
appointed a subcommittee of the Charter Commission and the
Charter Commission — the Subcommittee of theCharter Commission
recommended t© the board a single member district plan which
\

4

was rejected by the board»

The board subsequently had recom­

mended to it a multi “member district plan by this subcommittee I
of the Charter Commission arid that multi-member district plan
was presented to the court»
The Petitioners herein objected to the proposed
multi-member district plan on several grounds and further
sought to submit for the court's approval a single-member dis­
trict plan which was considered to be more in keeping with the
decisions of this Honorable Court,
Such presentation was not permitted by the New York
State Supreme Court and the Court approved the multi-member
district plan submitted by the Board of Supervisors by the
Respondents herein.
Appeals were taken from the Appellate Division of
the SEcond Department in the State of New York and the decision
of the lower court was affirmed with the dissent by the late
Justice Beldock,

A subsequent appeal ' was taken to the New York

State Court, of Appeals where again the lower court's decision
was affirmed with a dissent by Chief' Judge Puld.
Subsequently, permission for certiorari was granted
by this Honorable Court,
There are three petitioners in this proceeding and by
special permission of this Court those three have been granted
permission to appear today and orderly argue this cause,
I should like to tell the Court that there will be no

5

1

repetition of argument by counsel in order to save the time of

2

this Court,

3

in which this matter could be properly laid' before this Court,

4

I have been chosen to make the opening statement and so I will

5

give you some of the history of this matter and will also out"

6

line to you some of the arguments that counsel will make.

7

We sincerely believe that this is the only fashion

Counsel will argue that the multi-member district

8

plan does not meet the requirements of equal representation of

2

the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States,, as

1C
11

such requirements have been mandated by this Court,
Counsel will show that the Respondents have failed

12

to make a good faith effort which is required;; that a multi-

13

member district plan is unconstitutional if its district lines

14

are static but its population is subject t© changes that a

15

single-member district plan does meet the requirements of the

16

one-man, one-vote doctrine and that the standards of equal

17

representation as mandated by this Court apply equally to ail

10

levels of government and that multi-member district in tine

IS

County of Rockland cannot possibly meet these standards,

20

According to the —

21

Q

Xt is your theory, as I understand it, that

22

it’s just absolutely impossible for any multi-member district

23

plan to meet what you submit are the constitutional requirements;

m

is that correct?

25

A

Yes., that5s true, Mr, Justice,
6

1

Our position is that every decision of this Court

2

has been consistent.

3

of the Reynolds decision which indicated that certain de

4

minimis situation were unavoidable in certain situations, that

S

regardless of that the requirement is that there must be an

6

absolute de minimis and if one plan can achieve a — if you

7

will, a more minimal population variation, that is the plan

8

which must be accepted.

9

Q

Every decision of this Court, in spite

In other words, the — I’m looking now at

10

page 4 of the brief for Petitioners Molof and others, which as

11

I understand it, cuts out the present plan and indicates the

12

population of each one of the districts and insofar, unless you

13

begin cutting representatives in half or something, this is
t

14
'15
16
17

the best that can be done with the multi-member plan.
A

•

That is correct, sir.

Q

And you say that’s insufficient?

A

Yes, sir»

We , say that a more minimal popula­

18

tion balance or disparity can b<® achieved by use of the single-

IS

member district plan.

20
21
22
23

24

Q

You're not tacking (?) multi-member districts

as such, then?
A

No, sir.

Multi-member districts — single­

member districts have all been approved as being constitution­
ally proper;

it is simply a matter of meeting the requirements

of the de minimis rule set. forth in Reynolds, which must be

7

1

adhered to and the plan which best adheres to that must be the

z

plan that is adopted in order to meet the requirements of the

3

one-man, one-vote doctrine..

4

Q

While you are interrupted here now, Mr.

5

Barone, is ray calculation correct that the difference per

6

capita population per legislator, is from the maximum to the

7

minimum only 598, in round figures, 600 variation?

8

lowest being 11,577 per legislator —■

S

A

Yes »

10

Q

—-and the highest being 12,175.

II

20
21
22
£3
24
25

No; the highest would be 13,000, Your Honor,

in Orangetown? yes.

13

15

It is -the

So that it's a little over 60’0 variation from

A

Yes.

Q

Well, now, how fast, how rapid is the popula™

tion change in a given district?
A

Sir,- the 1969 Census, Special Census figures

itfhich were used for this calculation, have since been superceded by the 1970 Census figures, which I do not have.

I

believe that Counsel for Respondents has these figures and will
undoubtedly bring them before the Court.

However,the popula­

tion's variance, the change in population, I respectfully sub­
mit, will in fact, not make any difference in the argument that
Petitioners make, since the population variance can bring the
8

1
2

3

difference to a point higher or lower,, as the population in­
creases » '
So that we must deal, 1 believe, in this matter, and

4

carefully point this out, we must deal with the two basic re­

5

quirements that I believe this court has mandated in the

6

choosing of a re apportionment plan and that is that the plan

7

was determined after a good faith effort; and secondly, that

8

it achieves the minimal population disparity possible.

9

Your Honor please, with, the 13,000 down to the 11,000, creating

And if

10

an underrepresentation in Orangetown of 7.1 percent and an

11

over-representation in Clarkstown of 4.8 percent, the entire

12

disparity would be 11.9 percent, which we believe to be a

13

population variance not in keeping with the requirements of

14

this Court in its decision.

15

IS

Q

Is this dynamic growth that you are describing,

continuing; are the projections that it will continue?

17

A

IQ

Q

80 some thousand increase in nine years?

19

A

Yes; it's even increasing at a more phenomenal

Yes.

20

rata than that, Ycur Honor, and I don't have the exact figures,

21

but I am sure that the Counsel will indicate that the growth

22

is not. only phenomenal, but yearly-the rate increases yearly.

23

Q

Well, then a plan that was acceptable at the

24

beginning of one year might not be acceptable by the end of

25

that calendar year; isn't that true?
9

1

A

Yes? It certainly might not be acceptable at

2

the and of that calendar year.

3

we are here because we believe that a single-member district

4

which doss not have static lines * as our multi-member district

5

does# can best be moved or be flexible enough so that in deter-

6

mining representation the ability to determint that represen­

7

tation is inherent in the plan# which it is not in the multi-

8

member district plan which utilizes town lines as the boundar­

9

ies for the districts.

10

11

2

That is essentially the reason

As I say# -the disparity in the County of Reck 1.and
at the present moment is 11.9.

The cases decided by this Court

have clearly indicated that a good faith effort must be made.

1

Secondly# -that if there is going to be a population variance# &

14

disparity# that there must be some articulate:reasons set forth

15

to show that the policy in the state clearly indicates that

16

such a population variance will be tolerated# by reason of

17

state policy.

/

18

There has been no state policy clearly enunciated by

19

the State of Mew York# permitting such population variances.

20

It is respectfully submitted that the decisions in this Court#

21

as I said a moment ago# are absolutely consisten and that

22

popluation variances would not: be tolerated# whatever the plan#

23

unless it can be shown that tiers is a clear# rational state

,24

policy and further that a good faith effort has been made.

25

The inescapable conclusion must be that whenever it

10

I

is shown that another plan of reapportionment can reduce the
population balance, it must be adopted in lieu or the existing
plan no matter how minimal the population deviation is under
the existing plan®
Q

Welly what is the attitude, Mr, Barone, of

your clients, as to the Molof plan?
A
which plan?

I beg your pardon, sir?

The attitude to

I’m sorry, I didn’t hear you.
Q

Is it Molof?

A

The Molof petitioners ; June Molof, Mindy Baker,

et cetera, entered this matter as intervenors in the lower
court and w® subs tan fciciliy take, the same position that the onlyplan which is workable in the County of Rockland is a singlemember district plan.
Q

Well, that isn’t precisely my question.

My .

question is: would your, clients, in the posture of the case
today, support the Molof plan?
A

Yes.

Q

All rights even though it has a variation of

3.5 percent?
A

•
Yes-, sir.

‘

.

Since the Molof plan, as you refer

to it, Your Honor, has a population deviation of less than the
11.9 presently in existence.
Q

Well, do you really mean that, if it were 7.6

would you be supporting it?
11

1

A

I think? Your Honor? we must support a plan

2

which has been made on a good faith — a good faith effort has

3

been made in its implementatioft and secondly? that the

4

population variance must be the minimum that can possibly be

-5

had under the circumstances.

6

using town lines as static boundaries cannot possibly be

7

flexible enough to move with the phenomenal growth which this

8

county expects and which it has had.

9

And a multi-member district plan

As 1 pointed oufa„raomenfc ago? the County-of Rock­

10

land had appointed a subcommittee ~ had appointed a Charter

11

Commission and there was a subcommittee and that subcommittee

12

did suggest a single-member plan.

13

Board of Supervisors.

14

•that? implemented the second recommendation, which is a multi-

15

member district plan? utilising town lines as static boundar­

18

ies? thereby and the fact? incidentally? that the supervisors

17

would automatically be members of the county legislature?»

18

thereby perpetuating thoaoselves.

That was rejected by the

The Board of Supervisors? in lieu of

Counsel — my red light has come on and other

19
20

counsel in this matter for Petitioners will carry this point

21

forward.

22

Thank you? gentlemen.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

34

ORAL ARGUMENT BY DORIS F. ULMAN? ESQ.

25

Mrs. Uhlman.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS MOLOF? ET AL.

12

MRS. ULMAN;

1

May it please the Court? if I may, Isd

2

like to clarify a few points that have just been made.

3

answer to Mr. Justice Stewart's question about multi-member

4
5

district for Rockland Countys we believe that we — it is
K
possible to have multi-member districts in Rockland County?

6

provided —-

In

7

Q

But not using town lines?

3

A

Hot using town lines and not using static

0

boundaries.

10

Q

Right.

11

A

Secondly

12

Q

Could you definejust what

13

—
you mean by a

"static” boundary?
A

14

A static boundary isone which

is notsubject

IS

to change; in other words? the reasons for the present.plan are,

16

maintain town boundaries because of the inter-relationship be­

17

tween the county and town governments.
Mow? because of this? the boundary lines could not

18
19

change; they would have to remain the same throughout the whole

20

plan; otherwise you would not have your county representation

21

— your town representation on the comity level? and what we

22

mean by static boundaries is that these boundary lines can

23

never change-whereas the,,population within each town will be

24

changing.

25

believe are about 300,000 for the county.

And incidentally? the projected figures for 1980? X

13

,

!
Z

Mr. Cornell

in his brief, projected,* I believe, to

270,000 by 1985.

3

Q

If a plan plans representation that is sub­

4

stantially representative of the people and here the variation

5

is a very modest amounts, it seems to me, per capita, why

6

should you become s© concerned about how that's achieved, the

7

way the lines are, whether they're static or if they change

a

every two years, or whatever?
A

9

W

Well, we have, in our brief, set forth the

percentage deviations that would have occurred if this plan

11

had been in effect since 1950, and there were six Federal

12

Census's taken between 1950 and 1969. Of those six years, four

13

during

14

in excess of 20 percent.

15

1966 we would have had a deviation of 26 percent, between the

13

highest and the lowest population per legislator, under the

17

present multi-member plan.

four of those years we would have reached a deviation
As a matter of fact, as recently as

18

Carried to its extreme, if we follow the Planning

19

Board projections for 1980, of 200,000 we will have a devia­

20

tion of 52 percent end if I may refer to a footnote in the

21

dissent of Chief Judge Fuld of the Court of Appeals, he set'

22

an example where we could have a difference of 99.9.6 percent.

23

I'm not saying it's going to go to 99 parcent, but I do say

24

that at any given point, and the Census is taken regularly in

25

Rockland right now, because of its excessive growth, that ac
14

1

any point the deviation could be 6 percent? it could be 50

2

percent and we do not believe .that a plan that has this kind

3

of possibility for huge disparities, should be accepted as a

4

permanent kind of reapportionment because, truthfully, if

5

next year it goes up to 25 percent, we will be in court again.
And we do not think that this is a good basis, a

6
7

sound basis for a permanent apportionment plan.
We're not saying that all multi-member district

3
9

plans are uncons tititional —
Q

10

Mrs.. Ulman, I take it that one of your points

1!

says that in drawing a multi-member district,the number of

n

representatives that that multi-member district is entitled to

13

is :nofc just a multiple as a base ' population figure?

14
15

A

Yes, it is? that's how we get our discrepan­

Q

But, X thought one of your points was that,

cies .

m
17

in this case, that; a multi-member district is really over­

IS

represented, that is assigned- representatives ~ -the number of

19

representatives which, is just a pure, sheer multiple of the

20

base population figure?

21

A

22
23
24
25

here.

Mo? X don't think we presented that argument

What w@ did say was that because we are faced with the

base population being the size of the smallest town — in this
case, Sfoney Point — each town being ei multiple of that num­
ber, brings us to ©ur deviation.
IS

In other words —

1
2

Let's assume that a multi-member district

Q

here # system came out with a one percent deviation —

3

A

Right»

4

Q

—or a half of one percent deviation# and

5

is as close to equality as you could possibly get; you would

S

accept it?

7

A

No; we cannot accept it as a permanent plan»

3

Q

Well —

9

A

For two reasons? number one*, static boundar­

10

ies? number two: we do not believe a good faith effort has

II

been mad©.

12

Q

but you don’t attack the idea of assigning to

13

a multi-member district# that number of representatives which

14

is just a multiple of the base figure?

15
16
17
ie

A

No# we do not.

to Rockland County.
Q

You don’t buy the notion# then# that a multi-

member district is over-represented —

19

A

Ho# I do hot.

20

Q

—if that’s —

21

A

No# I do not.
W© do not feel that the County of Rockland

22
23

We only object as it applies

has made a good faith effort to achieve the precise mathemati­
cal quality which was implied by this Court in Kirkpatrick

25

against Preisler.
j

16

?

Q

Mrs., Ulman, do I understand that even if you

2

had. virtually precise mathematical equality, using town lines,

3

even if that were achieved, that you would still argue that

4

■this

would not satisfy the mathematical requirements?

A

We're not arguing tils case on the basis of

Then if you're not, then in fact you are,

8

essentially attacking the legitimacy of any reapportionment

9

plan that uses fixed town lines as a basis for reapportion-

10

ment representation „.

11

A

12

Q

Th at *s correct.
Well, how can you do that consistently with

13

the suggestion in Reynolds in Sisns that it is appropriate to

14

use town and county lines, et cetera?
A

15

For the fact that Reynolds' said that popula­

16

tion should be the controlling factos? in deciding a re appor­

17

tionment piano
Q

18
19

20

My hypothetical was: that you would come out

with —

'>
A

i

Yes —for this year it would be an equal, plan;

21

next yeas- it might not,, which is the — you know, this is the

22

basis of our argument, that whereas today we may have a. 9„5

23

percent deviation and it might pass muster under the plan,

24

under cases.

25

Q

However —
You're saying that it would-be impossible to
17

1

maintain equality if certain things happen by just assigning

2

different numbers of representatives to the districts, unless

3

you went to factional votings?

4

A

Yes.

5

Q

Has factional voting been rejected here, as

6

far as you know?

7

A

As I know, it has — we9ve had weighted

8

voting, which was rejected by the lower court, as it applies toj

9

Rockland and we have never had any other plan —
Q

Do you accept weighted voting or factional

A

Mo? I do not»

Q

Or do you reject it?

14

A

I reject it,

about a permanent plan.

11

A

Mrs. Ulman, you made mention a minute ago
Is any reapportionment plan permanent'

I believe so.

I believe that it is permanent

subject to changing of district lines as population changes.

17

However, because there are not static

Another advantage of single-member districts, of

course, is that the legislature would not become unwieldly

19

as it can, under this multi-member plan.

20

population at Stoney Point, for example, were to be made

21

fairly static, and the population at Ramapo, which is our

22

largest-'.town, continues to increase, we can have as many as

23

20, 25, even more legislators in a county the sixe of Rockland.

24

And we don’t think that would make a very workable situation.

25

As a matter of fact, as a practical matter, many people feel

Assuming that the

that the present 18 that we have is not very workable? it3s

Basically, wa don't think that the county made a

good faith effort because they accepted as. their basiG premise

the fact that there should be town representation on the county

Because of that we have the town boundary lines.

Originally when this plan was put forth it

Is it the matter — is it something like Stony

board and the-county legislature

their own towns.

14

who were also supervisors in

The purpose of the plan, as I'see it, was to main­

for their own political needs, whatever they were«.
/•

•••>

As it turns

*

18

out, the supervisor in one of the towns, Ramapo, for example,

19

does not even sit on the county'legislature? he never ran for

20

the county legislature.

21

So, for them to accept the county's arguments in

22

favor of town representation, Ramapo, the most obvious town,

23

has no representation on the county level.

24

Q

Well, you've got six —

25

A

You have six representatives? yes, from
21

Ramapo ? representing the people within the district of Ramapo.
There is no liaison between the town government# however, and
the county government»
In other words? no one on the. town level knows
what9s going on in the county.

And no one in the county will

carry forward any basic plans that have been proposed by the
town government.

Thisis what I mean by no representation at

the county level..
Q

And that's unofficial by the town official.

A

Right.

Q

Butf as I say?

perhaps it's a difficult

question to answer and perhaps you prefer not to answerit? but
I wondered if there was some sort of leverage or something in
the present system that you basically have a political objec­
tion to?
A

In the present

system X really couldn’t say.

I have no -—
Q

You rely? of course? just on fourth grade

arithmetic? but I wondered what this controversy is really
about.
A

No.

We rely on good faith efforts? we don't

believe that the arithmetic is as important as the efforts tha
have not been made by the county? to maintain equal represen­
tation.

As I say I'm not concerned that last year it was 11.9

percent. This year I believe it's 8 percent.
22

I'm more

1

concerned that the effort of the county to achieve

representation was not made and X believe that this was man­

the rule of Wssbsrry, which was cited by Reynolds in extending

Mr. Cornell.

the Court:
of numbers.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the only issue involved in this case is the question
Rockland County is a relatively small county and

politically, it’s a swing county.

It is sometimes Democratic

and it9s sometimes Republican.
The Board of Supervisors, consisting of fee five
supervisors originally, i^ere the Democratically-controlled
board and they devised this plan of reapportionraent, and after
the last election the board became — well, new legislative
body, became Republican.

So that politics really is not in­

volved in this case, since it swings back and forth.
The original —
24

Q

1

Is thus?© anything like an effort of soma

2

reform group or movement to try to get rid of the professional

3

politicans or anything like that?

A

4

5

I don9t think that that is in the case at

all,, Your Honor# because --

6

Q

Because tomorrow it's --

7

A

That's correct.

The original board of

8

supervisors felt that it was important to maintain a voice on

9

the county level of government from the towns, and that's what,

10

brought about this type of multi“member distrietplan and that's

11

really the only thing that's involved here.

12

there were certain townsf like the smallest town# the town of

13

Stony Point# that were somewhat isolated from the other towns

14

which are larger and they wanted to have a voice of their own.

15
16

17
18

Also, we felt that

They didn't want to be amalgamated with a larger area and perhaps lose that type of identity which definitely it had over the
many years.
So# what we're talking about really is numbers here.

19

It is our position that the plan which was devised complies

20

with the rule which is set down in Reynolds versus Sims and

21
22
23

24
25

applied to local governments in Avery versus Midland County#
which requires that the-population be substantially equal.

Or#

in other terms# as was used# "as nearly as practicable” the
districts be of equal population.

,-c

And we feel we have actually met that test.

25

Now# I

1

have set forth in Appendix A-2 of ray brief, the complete break­

2

down of how these figures operate and at the present time ,

3

based upoi!> the 1969 Census, the population variation which is

4

the largest is in the town of Orangetown, where the deviation

-5

is 7.1 percent under-represented and in the town of Clarkstown

6

it's 4.8.percent overrepresented, making a spread of 11„9 per­

7

cent from the smallest to the largest.

8

Now —

9

Q

10

11

As of 1969, but it was not true as of 1970;

is that right?
A

That's correct.

As of 1970, and these figures

12

are not before the Court, because these figures are very recent,

13

the 1970 Census has reduced this population disparity so that

14

the town of Orangetown which did have a 7.1 percent under rep­

IS

resentation, now is under-represented by 4.7 percent.

16

of Clarkstown, which had a 4.8 percent variation now has a

17

3.2 percent variation.

18

deviation? it hits it right on the nose.

IS

0.8 percent variation at this time and the town of Stoney Point

20

changes from 0.3 parcent to 1.1 percent.

21

The town

The town of Ramapo has a zero percent
Haverstraw has a

Mow, the spread between the largest and the smallest

22

now is 7.9 percent, so that the deviation between these two

23

— the smallest and the largest, is 7.1 percent.

24
25

Mow, in terms of absolute population, this amounts
to 1,017 people.

If you take the town of Orangetown, which has
26

I
2
3
'4

S

a deviation of 4.7 percent, to bring that into, line you would
have to shift the lines around same 400 or S00 people which we
feel is unrealistic because, in fact, it means that you may
have to cut a district line down somebody5s backyard or even
through an apartment building to pick up that number of people,

6

And 1 think that one of the factors -that's extremely

7

important here is to recognize that we talk about percentage

S

deviations — you must consider the size of the district which

9

is involved,

10

Mow, for examples in Wells versus Rockefeller, in­

II

volving the State of New York, which was approved by this Court

12

in May, the new districting plan on a Congressional level, the

13

average population for the Congressional District in New York

14

which was approved is 409,324.

IS

in the Congressional District ’would amount to an absolute

m

population of a little over 4,000 people.

17

Now, a one percent deviation

Now, it’s one thing to shift the district lines

is

around to pick up or exclude 4,000 people, but a one percent

n

deviation in Rockland County amounts to 1 percent of the mean

20

population of 12,000, or approximately 121 people.

21

impractical and unrealistic to consider the necessity of shift­

22

ing or moving lines or adjusting legislators to pick up or

23

exclude 121 people to provide for a one percent deviation or

M

more.

25

And it's

Therefore, it is our position that you must look at
27

i

size of the district in relation to an. analysis of percentage

2

deviations so that it can be a practical application of the

3

rule.

4

I would also like to point out that the

7

was a different type of situation.

12

And this Court said in that case that you were not

\

13

reaching the question as to whether . or not there is equal

14

apportionment of trustees among a limited number of component

IS

districts and you stated that he has said before that mathe­

16

matical exactitude is not required, but a plan that does not

17

automatically discriminate in favor of certain districts is.

18

In that case that’s exactly what there was.

There

IS

was a built-in bias and an automatic discrimination against

20

the larger districts.

21

smaller districts.

22

It was a built-in bias in favor of the

That problem was not found in this case.

In this case we merely have a situation where there

23

are equal member districts, multi-member districts, and there

24

is no built-in bias that’s in favor of the smaller or the

25

larger districts.
28

1

There Is reliance by the Petitioners here upon

2

Kirkpatrick versus PreisXer and Wells versus Rockefeller»

3

These itfera both Congressional cases and in the Wells versus

4

Rockefeller case there was a rejection of a maximum population

3

spread between the highest and .lowest of approximately 13

/

i

6

percent»
In the Kirkpatrick case, involving the Congress­

7
S

ional Districts in Missouri, there was a rejection of a spread

9

of approximately 6 percent between the highest and the lowest.
Now, it is our position that you cannot, on a whole»

10

11

sale basis, take these percentage deviations that may not be

12

acceptable on a Congressional level and transpose them down on

13

the smaller districts where there are smaller populations in­

22
23

2A
23

volved.
Also, I think the facts in both of those, cases are
distinguishable.

In Wells versus Rockefeller we had a situa­

tion where the State of New York admitted that there was an
attempt to provide equal population for subdistricts and that
the Congressional Districts were then carved out of these
regional districts within the state and the record show's that
the state admits that there was not a effort, really, to
fin® comb the district lines on the Congressional level.
In the Missouri case there are also indications that
number one; there was not a proper census data that was used
for determining the district lines.
29

And also there is a clear

V

admission in that ease that merely by shifting several counties

2

around that they could have provided for a more equal popula­

3

tion in its Congressional Districts.

4

We don't have that situation in this case at all.

5

The town lines have been used as the district lines and the

6

legislators had been allocated to the towns in accordance with

7

the population.

8

extremely minimal and there is no way that you could arrive at

9
'IO

And as I say, the population deviation is

a lesser population deviation if you adhere to town lines.

This

is the only way it can be done.
Now, Chief Judge FuXd in the Court of Appeals,

fi
12

dissented and he asked me when I argued that case, off the

13

bench, whether I wasn't concerned about the equal populations

14

changes and whether or not this plan might, depending on how the

15

figures cameoufc subsequently, result in a more substantial

IS

deviation.

17

Vitell said yes, but the figures might get better.

10

exactlywhat happened here.

Before I had a chance to answer the question, Judge
And that's

So, I think that the argument that he relies upon

19
20

in his dissent has been undercut by what actually has happened

21

here.

22

a multi-member district plan, assumes the population changes,

23

whether it be next year or thereafter, there may have to be some

24

adjustment to account for the changes in population.

2S

matter of fact, in this case the population figures that resulted

Any plan, whether it's a single-member district plan or

30

And as a

1

in 1370* improved the situation so the population deviation

2

now is as low» as I mentioned before: 7„9 percent.

3

Sot I think that the reasoning that Judge Fuld set

4

forth in his dissenting opinion» cannot be upheld» based upon
y
actually what happened.

n
n

Q

What was the basis for -— was it a judicial

rejection of weighted factional voting in this case or was it

13

by the commission or by the people, or both?

14

A

The people of Rockland County had two refer-

IS

endums: initially they had a referendum on a plan which is

16

almost identical to this plan and they rejected it.

17

seven months later there was a second referendum that had this

18

plan plus the single-member district plan, which is theplan

19

that the Petitioners are asking for, and the voters rejected

20

both of those.

21

About

Than the court was asked on a temporary basis to

22

impose a weighted voting plan until a permanent plan could be

23

devised, because the voters kept rejecting everything that was

m

presented to them.

23

The court said "no," that they felt that a

weighted voting plan in this county was not feasible, and I
32

1

agree with them.

2

Q

3

A

Why is that?
Welly the reason is that Rockland County,

4

if it’s analyzed mathematically, with the larger towns, because

§

of their size, would be in the position to nullify any vote or

6

any votes that would be accorded to the smaller towns because

7

it. is such a small town.

8

Q

If you had one body with six votes —
Q

I’ll put it this way: assume the population

15

changes so that in order to have each town represented, you

16

must have less than one vote assigned to some town.

17

wouldn’t raise the problem you are talking about.

18

would still have eight; would it?

19
20

A

That
Then you

Well, the way to plan to function would ba

that you would always give one legislator to the smallest town.

21

Q

Just with a half a vote or something?

22

A

Wall, no; actually the way I devised this plan

23

was that the ~ you start off by giving the smallest town one

24

representative and then you either divide the population of the

2S

smallest town into the others to generate the proper number of
33

I

legislators for the other towns.

2

the number of legislators.

3

Q

So that what fluctuates is

I know, but I gather that the argument on the

4

other side was that that technique theoretically could result

5

in a much wider variation if the population didn8t change just

8

right.

7

A

Q

it did, of course, they would have tc

Well, or you could — instead of starting with

one full vote you could start with a half a vote.

21

22

j

change the plan.

9
10

Yes.

A

Correct.

In other words, soma mechanism

would have to be devised to provide for that deviation.
I think it’s important in this reapportionment case

13
14

to recognise what’s involved here between town and county

15

governments, because this is really the stimulus for this type

26

of plan.
In the State of New York county governments in the

27
18

past have been run by the supervisors who are the chief execu­

29

tive officers in the towns within the county, though there is

20

never any legislative body on the

Therefore, the towns had a direct voice in the
operation of county government.

4

And bn the 'county level, there are a number of
functions of county government which can also be performedon
the town level and the desirability of having interrelationship
between the town and county governments in the opinion of the

5

Board ©f Supervisors, was to provide for the conduct of

6

business on this countywide basis so that there would be inter*•

7

relationship between the operation both of town and county

8

government„

3

For example: there is a large county sewer district

10

in the County of Rockland, which has a sewer plant and sewer

1!

line which ties in directly with lateral lines in the town,

12

So that this function of providing sewer service is directly

13

interrelated between town and county government.

14

The county has a civil service department which

15

administers the civil service on the town level.,

16

very direct fiscal interrelationship between the town and

17

county government.

18

towns adopt their budget and then the towns transmit the amount

19

of money to be raised by taxes to the county level and the

20

county legislature then levies the tax and directs the town

21

receiver of taxes to collect the taxes and then if the monies

22

are not paid as required it is then sent back to the county to

23

collect the delinquent taxes.

ship line basis . or town line basis, especially where they

2

have real functions, as in this case, is a rational justifica-

3

fcicn or excuse for some population variations?

4

A

That's right.

5

Q

Whereas.— but it might not be enough of an

6

excuse if the variation were 50 percent?

7

A

Fifty percent„

8

Q

And also it might not be a justification if

9
10
11

the town lines were legally really functionally irrelevant to
local government?
A

That is correct, Your Honor»

Of course, I am

12

also taking the initial premise here that the population

13

deviations in this case are so minor that there are not sub­

U

stantial deviations to begin with.

15
IS

Q

You mean this is based not on the 1970, but on

the figures that were actually used?

17

A

That's correct;

our 1969 or 1970.

18

Q

Because of the

smallness of the numbers.

19

A

Because of the

smallness of the numbers in­

20

volved, but in any case, I take the second step and say: if

21

this Court concludes that there is a substantial population

22

deviation here, that there are justifications that have been

23

shown for this variation and that therefore it should be

24

allowed under the test that's been applied.

25

And that was the format that was used in Swann
37

1

versus Adams, involving Florida and Kilgarlin versus Martin in

2

Texas, where you rejected the arguments there, saying that the

3

population was too large and that there was no acceptable

4

justification which was demonstrated before.

5

Q

The town lines wmight be — I take it your

6

position would be that the town lines have some real substance

7

in the purpose of local government, that these same variations

8

might not be satisfactorily justified by the town line basis

9

if we were dealing with a Congressional District?

10

A

That's correct, Your Honor.

I'm saying that

11

a one percent deviation, for example on a Congressional level

12

which involves a shift of about 4,000 people, when you talk

13

about a one percexit deviation on a local level, involves a

14

shift of approximately here 121 people, it gets to be a little

IS

bit unrealistic —

IS

Q

Yes, but also the basis of town lines perhaps

n

has less significance with respect

18

Congressman or —

19

A

to a representative, a

Yes? unquestionably.

I think on a Congres-

20

sioxial level that the municipal boundary lines are far less

21

significant than they are, for example, in New York? where

22

historically and traditionally there has been this interrela­

23

tionship between town and county government.

24

23

Now, as a matter of fact, to demonstrate the inter­
relationship here; the plan of reapportionment when it was
38

1

originally devised, provided that the town chief executive

2

officer, who was elected within the town, would be one of the

3

legislators within that town automatically and that he would

4

serve, for example, in the town of Rarnapo, which has six

5

legislators, there would be one who would be the supervisor

0

of the town, the chief executive officer, plus the five others,

7

which would provide for a very direct interrelationship so

3

that the chief executive officer of the town would still con­

9

tinue on the county level,

10

The court in New York

rejected that and said that

11

the statutes didnot permit that interrelationship.

12

the chief executive officer in the town must run separately

13

for that county office.

14

Therefore,

In other words, the chief executive officer in the

15

town can run on the ballot in two placesf one, he runs as a

16

legislator and secondly he runs as a town supervisor and as a

17

practical matter in Rockland County today, out ofthe five

18

towns, four of them have their chief executive officer who

19

serves on a town level and is ✓also elected and serves on the

20

county level, as well,

21

22
23
M
m

In one of-, the towns this is not the

case, so that thisplan has effectively provided for an inter­
relationship between town and county government, which was it
attempted to do, being also in compliance with the requirements
of Reynolds versus Sims,
You see, what happens on the local level is that
39

1

when you apply the rule of one-man, one-vote to a situation

2

like this# it can have the effect, if you set up single-member

3

districts, of slicing apart the interrelationship between town

and county government so that you would separate the operation

for this interrelationship.

here in Rockland County is desirable and it is our position

fchafcif a tight mathematical formula is applied on the local
level it may create difficulties in other areas where there is
an attempt, perhaps, to create regional governments or an
40

I

amalgamation of governments on a regional basis between some

2

of the cities and the suburbs and that there you may have the

3

necessity for a compact or an understanding between these

4

governments to arrive at a regional type of approach to govern­

5

ment and if you apply the population — the equal population

principle with strict exactitude on the local level this may

I9d like to touch briefly on multi-meraoer districts

from the theoretical standpoint.

it was raised in the Court of

17

This Court has, of course, upheld multi-member

13

districts on a number of occasions: Fortson versus Dorsey

19

involving Georgia was one of the earlier cases; Burns versus

20

Richardson, involving the State of Hawaii and then there have

21

been a number of affirmances of lower courts involving Wyoming,

22

Arkansas and of course, recently, the State of New Jersey in

23

Jackman versus Boiine which, I think you are familiar with,

24

provided for multi-member districts, as well.

25

It is our position that the use of multi-member
41

1

districts -is a constitutional method of complying with the

2

one-man, one-vote requirement.
Q

3
4 I

Is there any testimony in connection with

this plan in the lower courts?
A

5

There is no testimony at all, Your Honor.

6

The plan was devised by the Board of Supervisors and presented

7

to the Court and the Court passed upon it, based upon the

8

format of the plan without any testimony being taken.
Q

8
10
11

12

member plan in the lower courts was that the strength assigned
to a multi-raemfoar district shouldn't be just a mere multiple
of —

18
19

24
25

Q

There weren't any experts or anything called

No, but, Professor Banshof, who wrote the

leading article on this subject, did argue orally for the
petitioners in the Court of Appeals in New York, and the Court
there had the benefit of his- comments before them at that time,
Q

But there were no counter-mathematics pre­

sented?
Not other than what was set forth in oral

22

23

That is correct.

A

20

21

A

in connection with this?

16

17

I think that one of the attacks on the multi-

argument.

There was no expert testimony which was taken.

Of

course in this case there is no problem as there was raised in
some of these multi-member district cases and the one which will
42

1

be coining before this Court involving Indiana, of invidious

2

discrimination.

3

only question that was before the Court of Appeals was: are

4

multi-member’ districts, per se, bad if you allocate legislators

5

in direct proportion to population, rather than bringing in the

6

factor of the square root of population.

7
S
9

Q

So that was not involved here at all, but the

Have there bean any other court cases that

involve this same claim?
A

Yes, there have.

The Indiana case involved

10

this question and in the Indiana decision the court, although it

11

had a number©! other statutes involved, did

12

question of whether multi ■"•member districts are --

touch upon this

13

Q

Have there been any others?

14

A

The Supreme Court in State of Iowa: Krudenauer

15

versus McCullough (?) struck down a plan which did provide for

16

multi-member districts.

17

The concurring opinion by Justice Stewart in that case, touched

18

on the question of multi-member districts and in reading,, the

19

opinion, I suspect that he was saying, although Ism not clear

20

about this, I suspect that he was saying that multi-member

21

districts were per se, bad.

This case is not cited in my brief.

Q

Based on the Eanzhaf —

A

Based on the Banzhal theory.

Q

Any others that were litigated?

A

Those, the Iowa case and the Indiana case, are
43

1

the only ones — of course the New Jersey cases Jackman versus

2

Bodine has been touched on, but there the plan was* of course*

3

approved.

4

Q

Would you know any instances where those

5

people who were drafting apportionment; plans* either judges or

6

commissions or lawyers or legislators* have gone on the assump✓

7

tion

that multi-member districts give the assigned strength

8

on soma basis other than a multiple of the base figure?'
A

9

No* I don't* Your Honor* and I have made

10

inquiries.

I have not bean able to find any plan that's been

11

drafted or in the contemplation of being drafted which does

12

assign less than a direct proportion of the number of legis­

13

lators .
And 1 think one of the problems here* on this

14
15

theoretical aspect of the multi-member district* is actually

18

covered by Professor Banzhaf in his Lav? Review article* which

17

I have in front of me.

18

follows:

He says* in his own article* as

"No attempt has been made to evaluate all the ad­
20

vantages and disadvantages of multi-member district systems.

21

Furthermore* there is no suggestion that this article presented

22

a realistic picture of the actual operations* which of course

23

were involved* the factors which are not present in these

24

simplemathematical models." And I think the problem with

25

Professor Banzhafes theory is —
44

I

Q

Ke doesn't suggest how much of a discount,

3

A

No; he does not.

4

Q

It’s just that there is too much in a single

2

does he?

5

district having several representatives as against seme other

6

district having a fewer number or only one?

7

A

That's right.

8

Q

And somehow you are supposed to discount it.

A

Well, he uses the square factors.

How much?

9
10

He would

11

say, for example, if I understand his theory correctly, he

12

would say that if you haveone district with 10,000 people and

13

if you have another district with 40,000 people, that it would

14

be mathematically improper to allocate one legislator to the

15

small one and four for the larger? that the number of legis­

13

lators that should be allocated to the larger district is the

17

square root of population for two legislators.
Q

Yes, but that’s just something he pulls out

20

A

Well, he —*

21

Q

What’s the justification for it?

22

A

Well, he uses a mathematical formula to arrive

18
of the air.

19

23

at it and 1811 be quite candid; I'm not sure that I understand

24

it.
Q

25

In a way, he really thinks that it’s so
45

i

1

treacherous that you ought to go to a single’-member district?

2

A

If you follow his arguments logically it would

3

lead to the conclusion that fcheonly possibility is a single-

4

member district plan or that there would have to be some adjust

5

merit —

6

7

Q

Well, if his basic premise is right, maybe

there is some logic to that»

8

A

Well, I think the problem is —

S

Q

I say, "if his basic premise is right."

10

A

I think the problem is that he does not, in

11

creating the mathematical model, recognize that a legislator,

12

once he is elected from the district, takes into consideration

13

interests of the entire community.

14

alliances and may bu affected by pressure groups^ he may be

15

affected by what he thinks is right.

16

17

Q

He may be affected by party

If you make that assumption do you think

Reynolds against Sims would have come out differently?

18

A

No, I don’t.

19

Q

That’s interesting.

20

A

I -think Reynolds versus

Sims is really saying

21

that what is required is effective and fair representation and

22

that the ultimate goal and the ultimate aim is to provide for

23

representation by the ultimate constituents on the legislative

24

body. And I think that is the test that should be applied and

25

I think when you get to the mathematical refinements you are
46

!

moving away from the general premise behind Reynolds versus

2

Sims.

2

Q

If you follow the Professor's thesis to its

4

logical conclusion there is something inherently unfair about

5

New York having 70 or whatever number of members in the House

©

of Representatives and Alaska has only one.

7

A

e

Q

9

Yes,
Thera is a geometric progression and the force

influence which New York Congressman•can exercise as compared

10

to Alaska's.

I suppose inherent,, too, is that because New

11

York is closer to Washington than Alaska, there is some, kind

12

of a mathematical factor that gives them a good deal more

13

force her® than Alaska can have, per man.
A

14

I think if you followed Professor Bansshafs

15

theory you would have to come to the conclusion that in a

16

multi “-member district plan where you have, for example, four

17

legislators, that the four legislators who would be voting on

20

weighted voting.

21

block vote and that there would not be these other in­
This distinguishes the situation from

In the State of New York there are approximately

22

18 counties that have weighted voting.

There, of course, you

23

are allocating all the votes to one individual and there you

24

would have a situation analogous to block voting in a multi-

25

member district.

But, the voting power on a legislative level
47

1

in a muIti-member district, in this case, you have 18 legis-

2

lators, even though five may come from one district, there is

3

absolutely no assurance that you are ever going to get block

4

voting.

S

political alliances are different and they vote along party

6

lines as opposed to

As a matter of fact, you normally don't, because the

developed, that it is bad.

12

Q

Mr. Cornell, not

to say whether it's invalid

13

or not, but wouldn’t you think that if you had the choice of

14

one person representing you, or four representing you, and

15

one; you wanted something done and two; you wanted to hold

has a thing to do

with this

1 think that when talking

about, and as a matter of fact, the current opinion in the Iowa
case I mentioned before, Judge Stewart discussed the same type
of thing. He said, "Isn’t there something xvrong with one man
being able to vote for 13 people and another man being able to
48

1

2

only vote for one?"
Now, the problem with that theory is the chap who

S

is only voting for 13 people may be in a very large district,

4

so he3s only one out of a multitude of other people.

5

for him to have 13 legislators or four legislators in relation

6

to the total population of a component district ©f which he is

7

part, really is not giving him a better shape than the other

8

chap who has voting for one.

9

Q

So that

My second question, Mr. Cornell, about these

10

fixed lines; with regular district lines, how would they be

11

moved in Rockland County?

12

county legislature?

13

A

The Commissioners would do itj the

Ifysu didn't have this fixed boundary?

Well, the county actually, when establishing

14

this plan of reapportionment, appointed a reapportionment com­

15

mission which is an appointed body that is bi-partisan and set

18

up to try to devig^ the best plan and I am presuming that if

17

subsequent censuses show or if this Court says that this plan

10

is no good, that they would appoint a bi-partisan commission

19

again to come up with a new plan or a better plan or to cause
•t

20
2!

-

lines that would meet the test that would be laid down here.
Q

I still am not too sure I understand the

sanctity of these town lines.
A

Well, the — in New York the interrelationshi

of town and county government is the thing that the Board of
Supervisors is most concerned about.
49

In the past, before

1

reapportionment came in, county government was run by the

2

chief executives of the towns and there is a great deal of

3

interrelationship between these two levels of government.

4

And it wasthe concern of the Board of Supervisors who devised

S

this plan that they ought to maintain that interrelationship

0

between the two levels of government so that the towns would

7

have a voice in the county government,,

8

the town lines.

9
10

Q

That's why they used

And that wouldn’t apply to any other state *

necessarily, unless they could show the same thing.

11

A

Precisely; precisely.

Vi

Q

What my Brother* Brennan said isthat you

13

are

really saying that yours is an exceptional situation.

14

A

Well, it --

15

Q

Are you saying that all counties that have

16

towns in them are in the same category?

17

to find out.

18

A

No; I’m not saying that.

That’s what I’m trying

What I’m saying is

19

that in New York where there is a deep relationship between

20

county government and town governments, that adherence to town

21

boundary lines is a justification for some population deviation

22

and this may not be true in other jurisdictions where this is

23

the case.

24
25

Q

Mr. Cornell, are you familiar with a case in

your State of New York, involving one of the agencies of the
50

1

2

municipal government of the City of New York, involving
borough representation in the city?

3
4
5

8
0

Yes,

Wagner versus Blakey,

Q

Do you happen to have the citation of that?

This Court denied certiorari, if I’m not mistaken,
A

6
1

A

Yes,

That case is cited in the, majority
v

opinion in this case below, although I have a

feeling that the

citation is incorrect because I couldn't find it this morning?
but it8s in that case, it’s a Federal Supp,

---

As a matter of fact, that case is quite interesting

10

because there there was a district — in the districts there
11

wex^e equal population and then on top of that were two rep12
resentstives from the boroughs of the City of 'New York, and the
13

court held that there was not such a deviation from population
14

there and that the reasons._for doing this, because'of“the in­
15
herent value of the boroughs, was a valid justification for
16

proving ~
17

Q

Well, in addition to its apportionment repreSen

18

tions, each of the boroughs, be it Richmond or Queens, or
19

Manhattan or Kings, each had two representatives?
20
A

That is correct,

I have forgotten the numbers

21

involved, but you had two from each borough, plus you had
22
others that were represented from single-member districts which
23

were carved out within the City of New York,
24

Q

That was a Three-Judge Court case?

I believe it was, Your Honor? yes.

I don’t recall, Your Honor.

The case I am -thinking about

It was denied — cert was denied? yes, I

9

Q

That’s the Blakey case?

10

A

Yes? that’s correct, Your Honor.

I!

I would justlike to say in conclusion that on the

8

aelieve so.

12

local level and in this case, the important factor in my mind

13

is that the implementation of the -©n@~iaan, one-vofe rule has

14

the possible effect of separating town and country government
and that the efforts have been made by the Board of Supervisors
tomaintin this interrelationship which we feel is justified.
And finally, that if the ultimate test is fair and
affective representation set forth in Reynolds versus Sims,
that one should not look at the equal population principle and
the percentage deviations which are found, as the ends, but
merely a means to actually arriving at the ultimate goal of
fair and effective representation.
And the sterile, absolute, tight mathematical
analysis of population deviations may, in fact, frustrate the
situation and that the use of town boundary lines in this case

52

1

of course, also avoids the rather practical problems of

2

gerrymandering.

are adhered to»

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court;
I think I will simply comment very briefly on Mr.

!1
12

Thank you, Mr. Cornell.

Cornell's very excellent presentation on the multi-member
district.

I do not basically disagree with him; I don' t-'think

the question here that we have to resolve is whether or not
multi-member districts are constitutional per se, at all times,
Mr, Banzafs theory is fascinating, but I don't
think it should be or need be in any fashion, controlling, or
for that matter, was never submitted by my clients and never
contended by my clients below at any point.
I think there is something fchatought to be brought
out about the county and town relationship.

Mr. Cornell has

put this in the sense we have a — only an arithmetic question
and I think that he is fundamentally in error.

I think the

question we have here is whether we're going to have a county
government that is dominated and run and. oriented to the town

sa

1

government or whether we are going to have a county government

2

that is oriented and responsive to the individual voters in

3

Rockland County,,
And that8s the question that we must resolve? not

4
5

whether there is to be —

6

Q

Would you get any more by --

"7

A

Well, maybe if 1 simply give you some budget

8

figures you will have an idea of the dimensions that we are

0

talking about.
The county legislature on Monday of this week has

10

n

before it a proposed budget for the year 1971 of $53 million.

12

The largest town in Rockland County for next year, the town of

13

Ramapo, has a budget of less than $5 million.

14

enormity, the tremendous disparity in the sizes of these

15

governments are the nature of the problems they deal with, is

16

such that we can no longer, in the interest of the very thing

17

that Mr. Cornell has said: in the interest of meeting the

18

growing problems of the 20th Century, have the tail wagging

19

the dog.

Gentlemen, the

We have literally had that situation in Rockland

20
21

County

formany years.

This Commission -that counsel has so

22

well portrayed as having been appointed, by the Board of

23

Supervisorss yes, a commission was appointed and its members

24

and its representatives ware designated by the supervisors and

25

the proportions were in direct .relationship to the town,
54

per se; not the numbers of people in the town.

But, I am talking about the good faith effort

that was allegedly made by the County of Rockland and the
argument has been .made that the good faith effort is demonv

strated very amply by the fact that we had an impartial com­
mission that was appointed to do the job.

Well,''they did -the

job all right; they came up with a plan that would, maintain the
town lines ridigly without any variation.
And then I point out that in Fortson, he recognised
the right of multi-member districts and he recognized the right
to maintain boundaries and very properly so, but within that
system there was the ability to move county lines; not the

55

1

county lines,, but the counties within the structure to ensure

2

equality of votes.

3

assumption that I'm standing hare on, is that my vote is the

most important thing; that after that we look at regional

problems or we look at governmental problems.

Our growth is burgeoning so greatly, but, Your

Honor, there are some realistic limitations on it in the north

end of the county which is the base of this plan.

and I think that it is not idi© speculation to say that the

reason that it has the duty, from the standpoint of those who

Counsel has talked about the rational state policy
and the importance of the town and the county supervisors.
He didn't mention the fact that even the state law did not
write into it the automatic right ofthe supervisor to sit on
this body and yet this county legislature, this comity board
of supervisors, in endeavoring to preserve itself, not to
secure equality of representation, gentlemen, but to preserve
itself, put into its local law and when you look into the
Appendix, you'll see it, the right to sit —- not because they
are elected as a legislator —■ but because they are elected as
a supervisor,

by the extent that my vote is diminished in the County of

perhaps 25 percent.

a very fascinating article on the square root of something.
