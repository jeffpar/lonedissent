MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER? We3II hear arguments next

4

„n No. 59, National Association of Securities Dealers against

5

:he Securities and Exchange Commission.

6

MR. LEVINs May it please the Court, my name is

7

Fosaph Levin, I represent the National Association of Securities

8

Jealers, Inc.
The Association is made up of some 4400 members who are

9
10

ingaged in the securities business and a graat majority of them

11

jell mutual fund shares. At issue here is an order of exemption,

12

mfcered by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the

13

[Investment Sompany Act of 1940. And that order enabled the First

14

national City Bank to go into the Mutual Fund business.
At the outset I would like to emphasise the fact that the

15
10

Commission has washed its hands of its decision in this case,

17

rha Commission, it is believed for the first time in its history

18

las refused to appear in support of a Commission order. Further™

19

nore, the Commission in its response to the petition for Writ

20

of Certiorari, which we filed, stated there is no assurance that

21

the Commission would reach the same judgement if a similar matter

£2

is again presented.

23

Q

Has the Commission changed since the order?

24

A

Yes. The explanation for the Commission position

25

appears in the brief of the United States as amicus curaie, on

1

4

1

page 3. The statement there is that on’.y two of the members of

2

the Commission who participated in this ?ase remain as members

3

of the Commission, one of whom supported the decision, and one

4

of whom dissented»
v

5

The three subsequently appointed memberi of the Commission

6

are not prepared to take any position. Accordingly, the Commiss­

?

ion expresses no position on the merits and urges, neither affir­

8

mance nor reversal of the judgement,of the Court o:

9

Appeals.

In this setting, with the agency taking the position that

10

it does, the Court is urged here to accept here as agency ex-

11

pertise, which for all practical purposes at least the present

12

Commission has disowned. I might also point out that two of the

13

three judges in the Court of Appeals relied upon administrative

14

expertise in reaching their decision. The third judge, who also

IS

affirmed the order of the Commission did consider the merits of

16

the case.

17

The question presented involves Section 6C and Section

18

IOC of the Investment Company Act- Section 1.06 provides, and I

19

quote, "That no registered investment company shall have a maj­

20

ority of its Board of Directors consisting of persons who are

21

officers or directors of one bank." As I shall more fully de­

22

velop later, this was a prophylaxis prescribed, to deal with con­

23

flicts of interest problems resulting from

24

pany/commercial bank interlock.

1 rivesfcmenh com­

And the prophylaxis resulted form a record of gross abuse

25

2
5

1

in the relationship., Here the hank has created an investment

z

company which it operates and manages, and as the Commission

3

acknowledged, there are potential conflicts of interest between

4

the bank in its commercial banking activities, and the invest­

5

ment company.

G

Q

Is the investment company incorportaed?

7

A

NO.

8

Q

You?re just calling it an investment company.

0

A

Well, ifc-s an investment company under the Invest-

'

10

ment Company Act. The question of whether or not it is an invest'

11

menfc company in fact, is not raised in this litigation. In fact,

12

the particular, account has registered under the Investment Co-

13

moany Act as an open end investment company.

14

Ehe question presented here is whether in these circum­

15

stances, that is where there are potential conflicts of interest

18

the Commission may grant the bank an exemption from IOC by in­

17

voking Section 6C of the Act.
Section 6C permits the Commission to grant an exemption

18
19

from any provision of the statute, and I quote ‘

20

extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the

21

public interest, and consistent with the protection of inves­

22

tors, and with purposes clearly intended by the policies and

23

provisions of this title.'*.
Before considering the policy of the statute, its pro­

24
25

if and to the

visions, I'd very briefly like to describe this particular in-

3
6

1

vestment company which is called a Commingled Investment Ac­

2

count o

3

At the time of the SEC proceedings, the Account had not

4

yet come into being? it has now come into being. The Account, as

5

I said, is registered under the Investment Company as an open

6

end investment company, it s objectives are the investments in

7

common stock and convertibles which offer the opportunity for

8

long term growth of capital and income, a prospect offered

9

generally by investment companies.

10

It is an open end investment company or mutual fund, be-,

11

cause it stands ready to redeem its shares at net asset value,

12

and it makes a continuing offering on that basis.

13

The participations in this particular mutual fund are

14

called units and the minimum unit of participation is ten thous­

15

and dollars. There is no

16

into the fund and in that respect the fund is like the

17

Investment Soippany.

IS

sales charge when an investor buys
No Load

The Account uses an arrangement common to mutual funds. It

19

is managed by an investment advisor, in this case the bank serve,'?

20

that function, the bank maintains a continuous investment pro­

21

gram for the Account, determines what securities are to be

22

bought and sold, and executes those transactions.

23

For services, the bank recieves an annual fee equal to h

24

ofl% of the average net asset value of the account. This is a

25

type and amount of fee that’s customary in the mutual fund busi-

4
7

1

ness.

2

Operation of the Account is subject to the supervision of

3

the committee that is annually elected by the participants«This

4

committee is under the statute; as the equivalent of the Board

5

of Directors, and it was this Board of Directors for which the

S

Commission granted the exemption from Section 10

7

Commissioner dissenting, as I've indicated»

8
9

(c), with one

The Board has five members, three of whom are officers of
the bank. The account is subject to the supervision of the

19

Comptroller of the Currency, this particular type of operation

n

did not become permissible until the Comptroller adopted certain

12

regulations in 1963, aid the validity of those regulations is the

13

subject of No. 61, which is to be argued after this case.

14

Now as far as Section 6(c) of the Act is concerned, it

15

was intended for persons who were not within the intendment of

IS

the legislation. Now the Commission in its decision here ref”

17

erred to its traditional standards

13

invoking Section 6(c). And as the Commission put it,"the pro­

19

priety of granting an exemption largely depends upon the pur­

20

poses of the Section from &hich an exemption is requested, the

21

evils against which it is directed and the end which it seeks

22

to accomplish." And then it continued by saying that the showing

23

required in order to meet the standard set forth in Section 6(c)

24

as the compliance from which exemption is sought, is not nec­

25

essary to accomplish the Acts5 objectives and policies.
5
8

that it relies upon in

1

Our position here is that the action of the Commission

z

does contravene the policies and objectives of the statutes.

3

The Inv etment Company Act resulted from a comprehensive study

4

of investment companies which the Commission made and the Co­

5

mmission itself initiated legislation.

-That study revealed—

As you suggested* Mr. Levin, there's a companion

case to'be heard, I guess, tomorrow morning, and if by chance

9

the Court should decide that case, should decide in that case

to reverse the judgement of the Court ofAppeals, then the Court

need not and might not ever reach this case.

I think that's correct. I think in this case, the—

it this way. The matter was presented to the Commission in the

7

mission acted» The Sommission in its opinion assumed that there

8

was compliance with the (inaudible)» It didn“t consider the

9

issues» And then subsequently, an action was initiated in the

10

District Coutt challenging the validity of the Comptrollers

regulations»

12

13

Q

Well that was the basis of the motion to change the

order in the first place»

14

A

Yes.

IS

Q

Reverse the order of argument»

16

A

This study that the SEC conducted, which led to

17

the passage of the Investment Company Act, revealed a history

18

of abuse on the part of insiders.
And a paramount purpose of the statute was to treat with

19
20

the conflict of interest problem, particularly as it relates

2!

to investment company officers and directors and their affiliates»

22

Section 10(c) is part of the statutory arsenal that is

23

directed at that conflict problem. To contend with the conflicts

24

problem, the statute contains a variety of provisions. It pro­

25

hibits self dealing by insiders in very, very broad terms, it
7
10

!
2

restricts agency transactions by insiders, it imposes feduciary
.

obligations on investment company managements, it provides for

3

pervasive supervision by the Commission of Investment Companies,

4

and in that respect it provides for periodic examinations by the

5

Commission of Investment companies, detailed filings by invest­

6

ment companies with respect to their operations, and things of

7

that nature»

8

It also provides for civil and criminal enforcement meas­

9

ures. But the statute went one step further in terms of dealing

10

with the conflicts of interest problem. It felt that the impo­

1!

sition of feduciary duties,prohibition of self dealing, and
•i

12

Commission supervision and inspection was not enough.
In Section 10, which the Commission describes as a keystone:

13
14

provision of the statute, and which during the Congressional

15

hearings on legislation was referred to as a double barrel

16

tection, the statute imposes certain restrictions on the com­

17

position of the Board of Directors of an 'investment company.

18

Apart from the restriction of commercial bankers in Section 10

19

(c) , it also places restriction on membership by investment

20

bankers, by the investment companies9 principal underwriter, by

21

its regular broker, by its investment advisor, and by people

22

that are affiliated with it.

pro­

Now turning specifically to Section 10Cc), to use the

23
24

language of one of the Commission spokesmen during the Congres-

25

sional hearings, it is the consequence of horrible examples of
8

11

i

tebuse in the bank dominated investment comp my.

2

The legislative history, which is fu.ly sat forth in our

3

brief /this is with passages that condemn ■ibat particular inter­

4

lock. For example, Commission spokesmen, in justifying the pro­

5

visions of Section 10(c) during the course of the Congressional

6

hearings, made the following observation/ . There were very

7

undesirable consequences flowing from the relationship, some of

8

the worst examples of abuses we had is. the whole study arose out

9

of that relationship. The conflicts problem becomes more acute

10

in the case of the commercial barfcer. The publics funds are used

1?

to further the banking business of the insider. The Congressional

'12

concern, as it was expressed in the Senate report that accom­

13

panied the legislation was the concern with the unscrupulous

'14

banks who advance their own pecuniary interest at the expense

15

of the investment companies and thrir security holders.

16

Indeed the question in 1940 was not how little, but rather

17

how much should be done to restrict the bank interlock, and in­

18

deed whether it should be permitted at all.

13

And Section 10

(c) w&s viewed as a minimum safeguard for

20

there were those who advocated the complete segregation of

21

commercial banks from investment companies. For that matter that

22

position was even advocated by commercial bankers themselves

23

in the light of their unhappy experiences during the twenties in

24

terms of conflicts in the operations of bank sponsored invest­

25

ment companies.
9
12

1

And particularly significant in this regarc is the obser­

2

vation of Senator Robert Wagner who was Chairman if the Senate

3

Banking and Currency Committee. after the Commi? idon had put in

4

its testimony he made the observation, 1 think it would be better

5

if the Board were free of any kind of influence from bankers.

6

Of course, I know that that is ideal and that ve are. not going

7

to get that far, but then there ^ould be no chance of their

8

loyalty being conscioudly or subconsciously only t> their in­

9

vestment trust rather than to outside interests,i

10

The Commission explained 10

(c)'in saying that it viewed

11

10

12

instead of having complete segregation of Corame: cial bankers,

13

an attempt was made to permit it, and then to .drcumscribe ti,

(c) as a middle of the road approach. As a cor .promise-.» As,

3

In our view

it is unmistakable that Section 10

intended as a minimum investor protection

(c) is

certainly whe^e

there axe potential conflicts of interest.»

4
5

,

And now turning to

the matter of the conflicts of interes

that exist in this' situation»

6

As I’ve indicated,: the Commission acknowledged that there

7

are potential conflicts of interest here which could arise as

G

a result of the banks5 commercial banking business.

9

In fact, one of the spokesmen for the banking industry

10

recently, in urging the amendment of Section 10 acknowledged

11

the fact that the conflicts problem is inherent in the relation­

12

ship.

13

And in a situation such as is involved here, where the

14

bank has control of the day-to-day management of the invest­

15

ment company, with full rein in the conduct of its operations

16

the conflicts problem emerges probable as sharply as it ever

17

could.

13

The only aspects of the problem, of the conflicts prob­

19

lem, to which the SEC addressed itself, were those that it, it­

20

self had referred to, in 1963, in urging that the Section 10

21

prophylaxis was necessary for the type of arrangement that’s

22

involved in this kind of agency.

23
24

Q

You have to begin from the premise that the Com­

mission had power to do what it did, don’t you?

Q

The issue as it*3 posited here is whether the Co­

20

fliefcs of interest, may consistent with the public interest in

21

policy of the statute—

22

Q

Yes—

3

A

That’s right. Whether or- not it may have majority

4

control of that Board of Directors, and it was at that line

5

that Congress drew the line of prophylaxis.

S

It said, yon may have two, our of a Board of five, you

7

may have as many as two, but as a matter of prophylaxis, as

3

a matter of policy, you may not have three.

9

Q

Unless the Commission finds that it is appropriate

10

in the public interest? Consistent with the protection of in­

11

vestors and so on?

12

A

13

The statute grants the Commission considerable flexi­

No. A word about the structure of the statute.

14

bility in many areas of the statute. It permits the Commission

15

to exempt, permits the Commission to grant various types of or­

16

ders and what is necessary in the public interest, and things

'37

of that nature.

13

However, it withheld, or the statute withholds, that type

19

of specific statutory authority, exemptive authorigy or (in­

20

audible} authority, in Section 19

21

lative hearings show that it was intended in Section 10 not

.22

to provide flexibility.

23

(c). And in fact the legis­

What we have here, though, is a residual authority that

24

the Congress granted, in Section 6

25

Congress said if you, if there is a situation that isn’t within
13

16

(c) , and that authority, the

1
the intent of the legislation, it isn't the kind of situation

2
3
4

in which the evils of the statute are directed, doesn’t fall
within the purpose of tbs statute, in those circumstances you
may grant the exemption.

5

As I say, the only aspects of the problem to which the

6

Commission addressed itself, were -those conflicts which it

7

itself had emphasised in 1963, in the Congressional hearings.,

8

Urging that the Section 10 prophylaxis was necessary for the

9

types of arrangements the! are here presented.

•so

And the conflicts which the comin3.SE^on reffered to, and

11

they’re £©itr in number, is the danger-that the bank might re-

12

tain an unwantedportion of the assets of the bank sponsored

13

fund , in cash inorfder to earn money for the batik.

14

Secondly, the banks distribute brokerage according to

13

a fonmula, which rewards those brokers who keep balances in the

16

bank or have other dealings with the bank. This policy, the

17

Commission pointed out, in 1963, could lead to excessive, port-

IS

foloi turnover, or to a fund not reeleving maximum benefit

19

from its brokerage business.

20
21

Thirdly, that fund-investments could be used to shore up
bank l©ans.

22

And fourthly, that bankers or underwriters and various

23

dealers of various kinds in government bonds and that they might

24

use the fund as a plaice to place those bonds.
Nov/ these aren’t the only conflicts of interest. These

25
14

17

?

are the ones that the Commission addressed itself to.

2

There are others. For example„ a bank maty use the invest-

3

menfe company as a

4

an investment in a company in the hopes , or in ofder to get the

5

commercial banking business of the particular company.

S
7
<r>

bird dog, that is, it may have the fund make

There is also a competitive problem, the nature of
which was aluded to in the Congressional hearings, the sit-

u

nation of where a fund holds securities of a company which is

9

an important commercial banking customer. And the sale would

10

appear fcc be advisable but the sale would depress the- market

11

price, something that company mamagements don’t like. The

12

question is whether in those circumstances, the bank would be

13

able——or the bank directors would be able to 16ok at the mat­

U

ter of the disposition of that investment with an eye (in­

15

audible) to the interests of the fund, or would (inaudible)

16

be concerned by the impact on the commercial banking cus­

17

tomer .

18
19

Q

Is this power frequently exercised by the Com­

mission?

20

A

The 6

(c) power? Yes. The 6

(c) power is exercised

21

frequently by the Commission. The matter of the Commissions9

22

authority under 6

23

considered by a Court, and the 6

24

in the context of where there is no

25

15

18

(c) orders ordinarily come up
opposition to the grant

(c) grant becomes pretty much a

1

formal matter.

2
3

There are cases, though# where there is opposition# but
as I say

4

„

they are relatively rare situations.

The matter becomes one between the staff of the Com­

5

mission and the applicant and if the Commission is willing to

S

grant the order# the applicant of course is very happy that

7

there isn't anybody to challenge him. And that's why-there's

3

very little opposition.

There ®as an (inaudible) hearing.

19

A

It was all argument and briefs. We took the po-

17

sion.

20

siton before the Commis sion that the hanks application did not

2!

make either a factual or a legal basis on #iibh to grant the

22

exemption# we didn't- feel that we ought to be asking for an

23

evidentiary hearing.

24
23

We

thought that the burden was on the bank to show that

it—

16

19

1

Q

As the applicant for the exemption.

2

A

As the applicant for the exemptions, and in fact,

3

the only round that the hank advanced in its application was

4

the fact that unless it got this exemption, it wouldn't be

5

able to go forward in this particular mutual fund business.

6

Now the overall problem that8 s presented here, in terms

7

of conflicts, was probably as well presented as possible by

8

one of the Commissioners in this case during the course of

9

(inaudible) argument, and I might add it was not the Commissioner

10

who dissented, who observed that the banks application was

ft

presented, as he put it, in a vary exaggerated or exteeme

12

form.
The problem of the old matter of joint ventures assuming

13
14

joint ventures where the bank on the one hand in the exercise

15

of its various functions has a relationship with a company and

16

your account for various reasons also has relationships with

17

the company and who is to say where the propriety line should

18

be drawn, and is drawn?
And bank counsels* response at that point was that he

19
20

acknowledged the problem and he said that the bank would have

21

to live with it.
Finally, as the dissenting Commissioner pointed out, not

22
23

can the exsicfc form of future conflicts be anticipated.
In these circumstances, we submit, there is presently

24
25

evil to exception 10 (c) as directed, namely potential conflicts

17
20

1

of interest, and by the S3C8s own standards for the application

2

of section 6 (c) an exemption is therefore improper.

3
4

Now the Commission did attempt to rationalise an exemption
and we submit, of course, that the analysis is erroneous.

5

First, in what is an unusual stance for the Commission,

S

in administering this remedial statute, the Commission endea­

7

vored to restrict the intent and scope of the statutes, although

8

the statutes speak in terms of no registered investment com­

9

pany, the Commission said Congress really didn’t mean it.
And in this regard, it was also pointed out that that

10

11

this (inaudible) did not become permissible until 1963, with

12

the Comptrollers regulation and in terms of endeavoring to try

53

to find a basis to distinguish it, this pargicular fund, it

14

said that the fund was different from the bank dominated in­

15

vestment companies that were described in the Sonunissions8

16

study.
Now as far as the Account not being, becoming permissible

17
18

until 1963, I submit that that's irrelevant. In the Accounts9

19

posed after 1940 doesn"t negate the potentials for conflict, and

20

that-s what it the statutes concern under Section 10 (c),
Insofar as the Commission looked to the bank affiliates

21

22

of the twenties and tried to find identity, the Commissions"

23

own study in describing these bank affiliates says, and I quote,

24

s'That these affiliates acted as investment companies, in buying

25

and selling, securities for investment or speculative purposes.

18

21

1

It was for this reason that Section 10 (c) was enacted* and

2

it is precisely this function that 'the Account, or this bank

3

sponsored mutual fund is engaged»"

4

Furthermore

5

Q

The majority of the Commission said in its report*

S

as I read it* that the Account involved here is different from

7

that historic one that you just described,

8
9

A

That’s right* and what I am saying is that one of

the functions of those bank securities affiliates in the twen­

10

ties as described in the Commission study is that those af­

11

filiates among other things* engaged in the business of buying

12

and selling securities $or investment or speculative purpo­

13

ses .

14

And it was because they engaged in that particular activ1

15

ityr the investment company business* that they became subject

16

to the Investment Company Act and Section 10 Co) was adopted.

17

In any enent* the statute itself* patently rejects this

13

Commission approach* that the application of Section 10 (c)

19

terms on whether a particular company has a kinship to the

20

bank affiliates of the 1920’s.
And I refer” specifically to Section 10 (d) of the In­

21

22

vestment Company Act. Ten id) deals with so-called 'no-load"

23

companies that are managed by investment counselors. Now

24

those companies* it’s a special situation* those companies

.23

are granted

the matter of exemptions of Section 10 was con-

19
22

'i

sidered for those companies. These are open-end companies.

2

The matter of exemptions for those companies was spec­

3

iei f ally considered. THey were granted certain exemptions,, from

4

10 (a) and from 10

5

bank securities affiliates of the 1920’s hut Congress spec-

6

ifically withheld an exemption from 10

7

ly interesting that in the so-called "10

8

load company", there, is less of a chance of potential conflict

9

of interest because by hypotheses those companies cannot be

10

(fo), the companies have no kinship to the

(c)» And it5s. particular­
(d) company", the "no-

mangaed by banks.

11

And furthermore, the broad provision of Section 10

12

such that it reaches to all types of investment companies. For

13

example, I referred already to the so-called 10

14

pany, the company that doesn-fc have a Board of Directors.

15

Congress said, well we want 10

(h)

(c) is

(2) com­

(c) to apply where it can.

16

And furthermore it applies to face amount certificate companies

17

which haye absolutely no kinship or identity with the balk se­

13

curity affiliates of the 1920* 3,-

19

Now, the Commission did attempt to come to grips with the

20

conflicts problem. And what it said was, that there were sub­

21

stantial safeguards here against conflicts, that’s its char­

22

acterisation: substantial conflict’s.

23
24

And we submit that that doesn’t answer the statutory
question.

25

Q

Well their safeguards were the supervision by the

20
23

1

Ccmptro ller—

2

A

By the Comptroller, and also the self deal prohi­

3

bitions in the Investment Company Act and in the Comptroller

4

regulation,

5

Basically, the Comptrollers regulations really don9t add

S

anything to what the Investment Company Act provides. The

7

Commission, in its opinion here, in referring to the substan­

8

tial safeguards made reference in the first instance to the

9

Comptrollers regulations, to the Inspections of the Comptroller,

10

The fact is, and -the Commission made no reference to it,

11

that it has inspection authorities of investment companies and

12

as the Commissioner, i#ho is the spokesman for the Commission

13

during the legislative hearings pointed out, the purpose

14

of that inspection authority is to permit the Commission to

15

engage in the same kind of inspections as it permitted the

16

Comptroller under the—-

17
18

Q

How about investment in the secutiries that the

bank has underwritten?

19

A

Well, on that on®, the Commission found the Com­

20

mission imposed.la further condition that goes beyond the statute.

21

And the Sommission found that it saw no liklihood that there

22

woudl be any over-reaching by the bank while an investment bank­

23

er, And I raight add in that regard that the Commission was very

24

careful to refrain from making that same observation about the

25

fact that—

21
24

'i

Q

Is there a restrictior?, ia the exemption?

2

A

Pardon?

3

Q

Is there, therefore, that restriction in the ex­

4

emption?

5

6

A

There is a condition that was added in terms of the

underwriting of—the underwritings by the bank.

7

Turning back to the matter of the supervision of the Comp­

8

troller, as I say the statute granted the Commission the auth­

9

ority to inspect investment companies, as X*ve indicated earlier

10

the Statute authorized the Commission—-the statute prohibits

11

self dealing and poses feduciary obligation and nevertheless it

12

imposed, as a prophylaxis, this 10 (c) requirement.
Now the fact that, we submit, the fact that there may

13
14

also be regulation, or inspections by the Comptroller, in­

15

spections that as far as the statute is concerned that are

16

broader'then the Commission is empowered to make under the

17

Investment Company Act, there* s no reason to deny investors

18

in this mutual fund the specific 10 (c) prophylaxis, against

19

domination by a bank investment company.
The Congress thought that inspection of government over­

20
21

sight was enough, it was already in the Investment Company Act,

22

it didn't have to provide for 10 (c).

23

I'll save the rest of my time for rebuttal..

ARGUMENT OF MR. ARCHIBALD COX, ESQ.

2

.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

3
4
5

S

MR. COX: Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the
Court, as remarked earlier, this is one of two related cases.
But I think there is one respect in which they were not
correctly described.

7
8

9

It is true, as I understand it, that if the case to be
argued tomorrow, the ICI case, should be reversed, then this
case ceases to be important. But on the other hand, Justice

10

Stewart, even if the exemption should be held improper, which

13

of course we deny, than the ICI case still would ba important,

12
13
14
15

first because

Regulation 9 is at issue in the ICI case,

and because there's some reason to believe that it would be
possible to operate managing agency commingled investment
accounts even though there

16

were

no exemption from Secion 10 (c).

That’s a moot point, I don't mean to say that the exemp­

17

tion isn’t important. But it isn't quite accurate to say that

10

if it were denied that that would be the end of the managing

19

agency commingled invesment account.

20
21

Speaking of them as a category, not of this particular
plant.

22

Q

In other words, if you should prevail in tomorrow

23

mornings’ case, a differenttmechanism might be found that would

24

not need to be—that would exempt it from—

25

3

Two things are possible, as—

23
26

1

Q

2

A

3

. the 1940 Act?
Two things are possible as explained in the amicus

brief as filed by the fiduciary associations of Chicago»

4

©ne is that it's possible that it might be held that the

5

entire commingling authorized by regulation 9 is not under the

6

Investment Company Act»

7

Second (, it is possible that the Federal Reserve Board *

0

which has given its approval to these plans, and found them

9

in the public interest, might find it sufficient that the

10

bank had the contract to act as an investment advisor. Atj,d

11

two bank officers on the Board of Directors.

12

We couldn't be sure of that, that's why we asked per­

13

mission to have three, so that it would be wholly within the

14

bank, but if it had to go the other way—

15

Q

Yes,

16

A

I don’t think the whole thing could fairly be said

17

to be dead.

13

q

So I was mistaken in my vice versa comment.

19

A

Sort of uncertaine but not clearly vice versa,

20

right.

21

There are two general observations, wn.;.ch 1 think «re

22

pertinent to both cases. In the first place, it’s important

23

not to slip info such question-begging characterizations, as

24

mutual fund investment company securities business, all on our

25

side of fiduciary relations.
24
21

1
2
3
4

The rule at question here is which is the right char­
acterisation? And of course the right characterisation depends
upon an examination of what it is that the bank is actually
doing»

5
6

7
8
9

Second, the right characterisation has beer» decided in
these cases by the expert agencies unanimously in favor of the
view that what the bank is doing is performing a traditional
fiduciary banking function,, in a way that preserves the fiduciary relationship and which is in the public interest»

SO
11

This is a view supported not only by the Comptroller, but
by the Federal Reserve Board,, both in its rule in given to

12

City Bank, and in its testimony before Congress, by .the. Federal

13

Deposit Insurance Comapny, by the New York banking authorities

14

in parallel situations, and to the extent that it was pertinent

15

under the Investment Company Act, by the Securities and Ex­

16

change Commission.

17

And so here, the question is not as Mr. Levins argument

13

suggests, whether the Commission could properly exempt an or­

19

dinary investment company from Section 10 (c), but rather, it8s

20

whether the

21

when it concluded that this is not the kind of investment co­

22

mpany with 'fehich the purpose of Section 10 (c) was primarily

23

concerned, but as I say, a fiduciary banking activity, which

24

could be exempted without departing from the purposes of the

25

policy of the Act, and which should be exempted in the public

Commission may make permissable expert judgement,

25
28

1

interest.

2

That the Commission was correct in that finding, becomes

3

apparent when one goes behind the labels and looks at the

4

development of the commingled investment, account.

5

And to do that it's really neces&ary to go back to 1913,

6

•when Section 11 (k) of the Federal Reserve Act gave the Fed­

7

eral Reserve Board power to issue the national banks permits

0

to act in sundry fiduciary capacities.’"

0

The presemt language, with some roo.difications, is set
t

10

forth at page 1 (a) of our brief and it describes these powers

11

as the right to act as trustee, executor, administrator, and

12

so forth, or over an the next page, in any other fiduciary ca­

13

pacity in.which state banks can act. And there’s no doubt that

14

state banks could act in this capacity under the law of Mew

15

York.

16

Under this section, banks have, of course, long acted as

17

trustees, executors, guardians, and so forth. They've also

13

acted as agents to keep custody of a customers8 assets and se­

19

curities and to give him advice concerning investments, with

20

the customer retaining the final decision whether tfa change

21

his securities.

22

In addition, banks have frequently acted as mamaging ag­

23

ents in a strict sense. That is to say the customer turns over

24

his assets to them and -the bank makes and executes all imvest-

25

ment decisions concerning the management of the customers assets,
26

29

1

2

with a true fiduciary relationship between the principal and
the agent»

3
4

And I would emphasise that this is only one of many fi­
duciary activities, all of which belong in a single bundle»
