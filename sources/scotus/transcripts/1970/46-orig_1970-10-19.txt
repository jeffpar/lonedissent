ORAL ARGUMENT BY ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, SOLICITOR

5

GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES, ON BEHALF OF

6

THE UNITED STATES

7

MR. GRISWOLD:

Numbers 46 and 47.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

8

the Court:

9

United States against the State of Arizona and the State of

These cases are original suits brought by the

10

Idaho.

11

Voting Rights Amendment Act of 1970, the full text of which is

12

set out in the Appendix to our brief in this case.

S3

set out in the Appendix to our brief in the Arizona and Texas

14

case, the voting rights of persons are.

IS

Both arise as did the previous two cases, under the

It

also

And turning to page 78 I would point out the way

16

the statute is put together, after what has now become Title I,

17

which extends the 1965 Voting Rights Act and also steps up the

18

controlling date to the 1968 election in the alternative and

19

not in place of the previous one.

20

Then we come to Title II, which extends the

21

abolition of literacy requirements to all of the states.

22

is involved in the Arizona case, number 46, which involves the

23

voting age requirements, too.

24

25

That

And then in Section 202 of Title II we have the
fairly extensive provisions, dealing with
2

the residency

t

requirements and that, along with voting rights, is involved

2

in the Idaho case, number 47.

3

As Mr. Wright pointed out, there is in Section 205

4

a separability clause which is in an odd place, but its

5

language is certainly broad enough to be applicable to any of

6

the provisions of the Act and finally, in Title III we have the

7

voting rights provision which were the subject.' of -the

8

argument this morning.

9

As I have indicated, both of these cases involve

10

voting rights.

11

in the Texas and Oregon cases, but I do have a few supplemen­

12

tary points which I would like to advance.

13

I will not repeat the arguments which I gave

The Chief Justice asked whether, in Carrington

14

against Rash the two classes were not identical and this made

15

the restriction against one of them invalid.

16

I think I can respond to that now precisely with

17

respect to Evans and Cornman, which also dealt with exclusion

18

based on residence.

19

there were differences between the two classes concerned.

20

Residents in the enclave did not pay real estate taxes, either

21

directly, or through their rent.

22

different criminal provisions insofar as they were subject to

23

the Maryland law that was pursuant to the adopting proviaons

24

of the Federal statute.

25

There, as I mentioned in my argument,

They were subject to somewhat

The issue of residence involved there, like that of
3

?

age, is one as to which, in general, there is a substantial

z

state interest, of course»

If the question of drawingrfine
.

3

lines were one of state prevalence, then we would have expected

4

the Maryland statute to be upheld.

S

Whether people are Maryland residents as a matter

6

of Maryland law, would seem to be in the first instance a

7

matter for the Maryland Legislature.

8

Court was right in that case in concluding that the law

9

violated the Equal Protection Clause.

But we think that the

In the Cornman case the

10

Court readily could conclude that the basis offered by

11

Maryland for the distinction was insufficient.
Q

12
13

Is it really accurate to say that they are

in Maryland or are they on an island surrounded by Maryland?
A

14

WEll, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that the

15

Court decided that they were in Maryland.

16

seiid in its opinion that it was within the external boundaries

17

of Maryland.

18

Q

The Court certainly

I suppose if it hadn’t been for the en­

19

clave factor it wouldn't have been necessary to be so circum­

20

spect in these terms, would it?

21

A

No; I suppose not, but I think the Court

22

must have decided that they were residents and citizens of

23

Maryland, otherwise they couldn't vote.

24
25

In this case the Court alone — in that case it was
black and white; either they were in or they were out.
4

There

1

was no numerical problem; no line drawing problem and the

z

Court, we think, properly held that they were in Maryland, and

3

for Maryland to say otherwise, was not supported by a suf­

4

ficiently compelling reason to take it out of the Equal Pro­

5

tection Clause.
In this case the Court alone might not be able to

6
7

reach such a conclusion, choosing between 18 and 21 requires

a

line drawing which the Court is not particularly well-qualified

0

to do.

no

Congress can do it and Section 5 of the 14th Amendment,

we submit, permits it.

11

Now, let me go back to the South Carolina against

12

Katzenbach case and we call attention to the specific provis­

13

ions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 which was upheld there.

14

The literacy test provision sustained there had a trigger

15

provision fixed by Congress under which the provisions of the

16

statute went into effect in states where less than 50 percent

17

of the possible voters had registered or had voted.

18

Now, this might have been 40 percent; it might

19

have been 60 percent, but Congress made it 50 percent. This

20

figure was never questioned.

21

22
23
24
25

If Congress had power to act at

all, the establishment of such a figure was exactly what it was
qualified to do, better qualified on the whole than the courts.
And in Katzenbach against Morgan the statute up­
held was applicable to those who, studying in American Flag
schools were — who studied in American Flag schools where
5

1

Spanish was the language, had proceeded through the sixth

z

grade -— not the fourth grade, or the eighth grade, but the

3

sixth grade.

4

difficult to decide, simply under the Equal Protection Clause

5

whether the fourth or the fifth or the eighth or the sixth.

6

It is hard for ma to even think of a recordwhich would really

7

support such a determination.
In both of these cases.. Congress, proceeding under

8
9

I think this Court might have found it very

the enforcement clause of Section 5 of the 14th Amendment,

!0

drew lines and fixed exact points.

Now, this is the kind of

11

line that Congress is wall-qualified to draw and. this was up­

12

held by this Court.
And I may go back to the definition by Congress

13
14

under the 18th Amendment of what constituted intoxicating

15

liquor.

16

exactly the same kind of a line well-drawn by Congress and

17

18

Some of us may recall 3.2 beer and I guess that was

perhaps difficult for thi3 Court to draw, pursuant to the
powers expressly granted to Congress, or in that case, to en­

19

force the 18th Amendment.

20

Q

21
22
23
24

Well, Mr-. Solicitor General, does Section

5 give Congress equal power to exclude as well as include.

suppose that would have bees found to be unconstitutional.
Q

Well, I would suppose there nay be some

12

limites, but how about the standards by which we judge the

13

validity of a Congressional action under Section 5?

14

for exclusion as inclusion?

15

within the reach of the 18th Asetidment if it’s got something

intoxicating in. it of a certain amount.

Congress has power to say that anything which this Court has

not be a violation of Equal Protection.

is to bar actions -which it regards as dinials of equal profcec- ,

about inclusion and exclusion»
I also said this morning that if Congress doea

Q

Well* what iswhy should Congress —

IS

A

Because

19

the constitution itself says that

.nor shall any state deny, deprive any person of the equal

20

protection of the laws and if this Court has held that the statu

21

had deprived a person of the laws* nothing that Congress does

under Section 5 can be an action by Congress to enforce the

24

enforcement of the 14th Amendment but not to enforce the 14th

25

Amendment.

It can be an action by Congress to limit the

Weil, if Congress thinks that an action

Q

z.

of this Court frustrates the V :h

er»forcing it by —

4

A

why isn't that

Well, 1 th:uvk that that might well be and

5

we've already referred to that -nd specifically the Virginia

6

literacy statute which this Court hole- to be consistent with

7

the 14th Amendment, was thereat tor made ineffective by the Act |

8

of Congress under Section 5 ire slveci in SouthCarolina against

9

Katzenbach.

I don't know that Congress necessarily dacidec

10

that this Court's decision feast sated the* 14 th Amendment but Y.

11

think it did decide that under all the circumstances it could

12

not effectively enforce the lit! irarndment.

13

Now, let me turn tc first., the cast; of the United

14

States against Arizona and the literacy problem which is in­

15

volved there, arising under Section 201. of the statute*

16

thatprovision Congress has prov r.ded that any test or device

19

of literacy as a. requirement, s’ all be invalid in all states

20

of the country to which the trigger provisions of the 1965 Act,

21
22

I
as extended, do not apply.
And the effect of t at is that literacy requirement^:

23

are made invalid throughout the United .States.

24

that they are exactly the same

25

I cannot say

n every part of the United

States, because any state which is within the trigger class

is also subject to further prov i.s±ons under which it cannot

st.

And so the question is, as to the power of Ccngressj
seeking to act under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment or other
provisions which might, in this

include Section 2 of the

15th Amendment and even Section 2 o ': vhe 13th Amendment, has
power to extend the abolition . ' hi-.-.©racy requirements tc the
en.fc.ire country „
I am inclined fee th:. nk that the way the argument
has developed we have argued the: most difficult case first?
that is that the voting age reqairen-sat raises the most
serious intellectual and consti-.afcir..i problems.

only to keep the Indians from voting.

that there were some•80,060- persons in Arizona who were barred
from voting on the literacy■requirements.
I think that's a disappointing showing, but I don’t
think it’s terribly significant.

All the experience in the beep

South showed that you. got people to register only by fairly in­
tensive voting drives and indeed it, was not very effective until
lots of people went down and gave-

people information and instruc­

interest with respect to literacy; they have an interest in

First I would like to correct or restate some of

s

tile facts stated by the Solicitor General..
In the Government's brief the figure used is

0

7

certainly 3,400 rather than 87,000 as the number in Arizona

8

not registered.

9

21st of August only 18 people have registered to vote in all oi

10

And since the order of Justice Douglas on the

the 14 counties of Arizona, rather than 21 as stated.

11

In 'the appendix of Arizona's brief we have attached

12

copies of all of the county recorders of Arizona, setting forth

13

the number that did register and the total population’ of the
said county as revealed by the latest census figures.

in all of the papers and the television and radio broadcast tha

they had the opportunity for three weeks,. Mr. Justice? "to
register.
It is Arizona's position that there was not adequat 2
basis given for the enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 1970.
Arizona was not given an opportunity to be heard and that in th Is
Court's decision in the Morgan case the Court satisfied itself

21

that pertinent factors were used in. that Congressional
1
decision.

Here there is nothing before, this Court for which

it can pursue the basis of which Congress acted as it did in

18

has never been the case in

‘Arizona and Arizona has people from

all different parts of the country residing there, that have

use that, but it will impede -the right of someone else who has
taken the time to learn to read and write.

device to prevent someone from voting '.hat would be one thing;

17

Q

Why do you, say that?

18

A

Because» Your Honor» our whole system in

the Courts

questions that were just asked, concerning the literacy in the

Indian Nation and the reasons for not registering in the in­

9

are exceedingly frightening to me, as chief legal officer of fchji

10

II

if I might just briefly comment on some of the

I think there are a combination of factors that

state, which has a large Indian population.
I think one of the problems is that the Indians,

12

since 1800 have by and large rejected the Federal Government's

13

efforts to bring them into the mainstream of this country's

14

processes, whether it. is by language, by government, or any

!5

other criteria — education, if you want to wave and I think th is

16

is the reason, in addition to the actual factual matter, but th

\7

communications on the reservation are totally inadequate to

IB

take information to the Indian Nation.

19

the solution is to it, but they have exactly three jurisdictions

20

that they are concerned with, not any one of which has thorough

21

responsibility over them; the Federal Government, the state in

22

which they are in and their own nation, and it is a pressing

23

problem but I don't think that it is right for them to be able,

24

in a sense, without having any basis in fact or knowledge to

25

legislate in the State of Arizona, and I think they could

And I don't know what

i

particularly in two counties, if they chose to do so.
So? it8s a problem with which we are really concur? ed

2

3

and we don’t purport to offer here, nor would this be the props r

4

forum, all of the answers to this question.
Q

5

6

Are those two counties a majority of Indians

in the population?

7

A

I believe that is correct; yes.

a

Q

Well, what's wrong with them governing

9

themselves, or dc you think they are illiterate?
A

10

11

Nothing, but 'they don’t choose to do so,

Mrc Justice Marshall.

They have never chosen to do so.

12

Q

Who has given them the opportunity?

13

A

Well, there is no evidence — there was no

14

evidence before Congress and there is no evidence here as a

15

basis to these admittedly short-term opportunities and affi­

16

davits that they cared to do so,

17

and register and run the two counties, even though they

18

wouldn't admittedly be subject to paying any of county's taxes

that they cared to come in

19

Q

Are they free to vote in those counties?

20

A

As far as I know they axe, Your Honor.

Q

Oh, you take it that the natives don't want

I think it's net quite that simply explained

but they haven't shown motivation; certainly that's true.
Q

Well, why do you oppose this move to give

37

1

the illiterate ones the right to vote?

2

A

We oppose it on the constitutional grounds

3

that we don't think it can be done this way, plus we oppose it

4

on 'the main grounds, as Mr» McGowan mentioned, concerning the

5

I just don’t think it would be done; it.

Do they have members of the legislature in

the State Senate?
A

They finally elected one Member of Idle

24

House of Representatives, which is the lower body and he served

25

one term; his name was Lloyd House; he was a Navajo and he trie
38

1

to run for the Congress and was beaten in a three-way primary.

2

To the best of my knowledge and I would ask Mr.

3

McGowan to check his records, that’s the only Navajo that’s

4

been elected.

5

Apaches, perhaps, Yavapis, who are either totally Indian or

6

part Indians who have been elected, but I just can't recall.

7

Lloyd House, I know.
Do they have districts there 'the Indians can

8
9

There have been, I believe, some other Indians,

elect members?
A

10

Oh, yes, i think there are at least two

11

districts in Arizona there, if all the Indians voted, even 'the

12

one -that perhaps are registered, they could elect & representa­

13

tive if they chose to do so.
Now, if I may briefly touch upon which I think is

14
15

16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

the most critical issue before this Court.

I sort of feel a

little bit like proving Lincoln’s words; I think it’s appro­
priate, although it’s a different form than he found himself at
Gettysburg.
I think we are realxy met,here today in this par­
ticular question of the 18-year-old vote to find out if our
country so conceived as ours has, can long endure.

And I think

that’s really the ultimate test that we’re faced with when we
brush our other cases aside, our decisions, and look simply at
the Fourteenth Amendment, even though we may call it abortive,
or an anachronism, or whatever we call it.
39

I don’t see how we

1

2

conceivably sweep it away.
And 1 think 1 was very encouraged to hear the

3

Solicitor General, mention that we still consider the Electoral

4

College, which I think is a classic example of what most people

5

in most of the states for different reasons and with different

6

degrees of how they would like to change it, totally inapposite

7

to our system today.

8
9

But, it's still there,

I find myself in tine position where personally, I
have for years circulated petitions to get the 18-year-old vote

question on the Arizona ballot.

11

it will happen and that8s not the issue,

12

dangerous situation that we find ourselves in because 1 -think

13

historically this is where the governments tend to make the fix at

15

area where everybody sees a need.

an evil thing that we“re doing, so why not do it the easy way;

whatsoever.

Now* 1 concede a very sound argument to be made

that Section 5 may give a concurrent remedy other than the

:

Yes 'i excuse me.
Q

What you are arguing is that the second

41

1
2

section of the 14th Amendment does — what do you think it does?
A

I think it sets a minimum age for voting at

3

21 years under which the Federal Government has no authority

4

to enforce any sanctions against the state whatsoever, for dis­

5

allowing people under the age of 21 to vote.

6

that very clearly.

7

I think it says

Now, granted, perhaps if we had been drafting the

8

14th Amendment, we could have set it batter or more straight­

9

forwardly but I don't think we can strew away the fact that, it

10

says to the states: "States, if you don't allow your people

11

who are 21 old or older to vote, the Federal Government can cone

12

in under this amsndraent and sanction it.»"

13

to say, "If you do allow all people under 21 years of age or

14

older to vote, then the Federal Government has no authority

15

to come in and sanction you on that purpose and I just — well,

16

it's inconceivable to me, quite frankly, that we could come to

17

any other conclusion in spite of the sound constitutional

18

lawyers and judges opinions that are to the contrary.

And, it seems that we wouldn't even be bending the

constitution; we'd simply be breaking it, and while it would

21

be for a good purpose and a result that I personally want to

see accomplished, I think it would just be the first step and

every other step then would be a little easier, even if it were

24

more controversial.

4

perhaps, that's attributable to this, although I think that's

5

an erroneous conclusion and I just would urge this Court to

think very, very carefully about ignoring, as Congress said,

GENERAL OF THE STATE OF IDAHO

MR. ROBSON:

the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and Gentlemen of

I hate to keep flogging this poor Katzenbach to

death but it looks like that's the name of the game' all after­
noon .
I think that we have heard enough arguments that I
can assume that this Court will recognize Congress, at least
directly by the Constitution of the United States, has no right
43

1

to enfranchise any citizen to vote per se.

2

legislate to prevent discrimination under the Equal Protection

3

Clause is not denied and a combination of Article 14, Section

4

1 and Section 5 certainly has been allowed to be exercised by

5

this Court in a good many areas.

That Congress can

6

But I think when you look at Section 14 as to the

7

whole you find that really the intent of the enactors of that

e

piece of legislation were attempting to stop discrimination

©

against citizens of the United States in an area where dis­

io

crimination had been practiced for a hundred years because of

ii

race, color and national origin.

12

They were so unsure about Section 14 in what

it

13

did that they enacted Section 15 to make sure that they weren't

14

understood, or they weren't misunderstood.

15

I think Katzanbach, and I want to point this out

16

because I don't think it's been pointed out in any argument

17

today that Mote 14 .shows that expressly in the Constitutional

18

Convention of the State of New York there was a great deal of

19

discussion about our national origin.

20

that this Court was taking a real good look at that when they

21

decided Katzenbach.

22

I can't help but believe

Contrary to the argument of the Solicitor General,

23

I do think that there was, in this Court's mind, some invidious

24

discrimination on the basis of race, color and creed or

25

national origin.

I'm not on your wave length.

Q

You said that the 14th Amendment was restrict*

10

to the newly freed slaves and I submit Puerto Ricans weren't, evsan

11

here at that time.

12

A

And Katzenbach involved Puerto Ricans.
I understand that but the New York Constitu­

13

tional provision that was struck down in Katzenbach, as I under

14

stand it, in one of the footnotes in that case there was clearly

15

pointed out -- I think it's on page 645 or 654 — 654 to be

16

exact, 384 U.S. 654.

17

this has been looked at because there’s a quote in there direct

18

but Df the Constitutional Convention of the State of Mew York„

19

which showed that they were considering national origin as the

20

source or their limitations.

21

22
23
24
25

I think that that footnote indicates that

I just wanted to point that out that this was
before this Court and it does have Some overtones.
Another thing that I would like to point out to the
Court and there has been some discussion of this today but not
specifically.

Th€;re was a specific finding by Congress in the
45

■y

i

determination of how they were going to word the section in

2

regard to the 18-year-old vote in which they found in exactly

3

the language of this Court in Katzenbach that it was an

4

invidious discrimination for the states not to allow 18-year-

5

olds of age to vote because of their military service and it was

6

required by them and I would like to point out that this is, I

7

think, a syllogism because certainly more than half of the

8

18-year-olds in this country are women and are not subject to

9

any Federal service.
The service is required by the Federal Act, not by

10

11

a state act, so this can’t be a state discrimination here.

12

the fact that of 50 percent of the males who are old enough to

13

be subject to the military service, only about ten percent of

14

them ever served, unless we were in the World War 11 situation.
1 don’t believe that just because you are old enouch

15

to fight means that you are ©id enough, necessarily, to vote.

U

All that means is that you are ©Id enough to take orders

17

and you’ve been old enough t© do that since you could under­

18

stand.

19
20
21

22
23

24
25

Anc

The other side of the coin is that if you are too
'

old fight, as I am now considered to be by my country, then
you are too old to vote», and I don't think I’m too old to vote.
I would like to point out another argument
that; I’d like to make.

The rationale and the arguments that
46

1

have been proposed here by the Solicitor General are that by

2

a combination of Sections 1 and 5 of the 14th Amendment,

3

Congress can cl© something indirectly that it can't find in

4

the enumerations of powers chav, at may do directly.

5

In other words, by removing a, step by coming on

8

with an argument that, because we want to enforce equal protec­

7

tion ©f the laws and we don t want any discrimination we can

8

come in the back door and do what you could not do directly,

9

I think is a parody on the law and I don't think it's an

10

argument that holds too much water, particularly in & situation

n

where there is no particular di.3criEdne.tioa by a state that is

12

really pervasive across-the-board.

13 i

particular age group or sectior of the population is really

14

being discriminated against anj more than another.

Where yon can show that any

15 I

Here is a group between 18 and 21 that are not

allowed to vote.

if you, by the premise 'that’s presented hare by tha Solicitor

It also seems to me in regard to this — this is

11
12

the last comment I would like to make in regard to the Katzenbach

13

case — it seems to me that when Congress made the finding the}

14

did that there was an invidious discrimination because the

15

states did not allow 18-year-old persons to vote, that the legis­

16

lature was, in effect, invading the judicial power of the United

17

States which is invested in this Court.
Now, somebody said that — I think it was the

than it was the nine men on this Court.

Now we get down to the arguments of the Solicitor
General in regard to the terrible discrimination which my state,
perpetrates on residents of the State of Idaho»

It seems to me this argument hasn't been made at all

There seems t

10

be a philosophy or a tendency on the part of, not only courts,

but Congress and legislators and lawmakers of all kinds to pro­

13

upon us to protect him from everything.

Now, it doesn't seem to ms so great of a burden

15

that a man ought to be able to get, if he is going to leave a

16

state, get down to the county courthouse and get his absentee

ballot and vote it before he goes to Timbuctu or he goes to the

18

playground U.S.A. or he flies to Europe or he comes back here

sorry, Mr. Chief Justice, because tire statute provides that the

is no obligation on the state to get the ballot there.

11

are closed I don ’ t 'see %\y burden on the state above and beyond

So, I couldn't follow that particular argument.

I was thinking of this particularly, Mr.
