ARGUMENT OF BEATRICE ROSENBERG, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8
9

We will hear arguments

MISS ROSENBERG:
the Court.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This case is here on petition for writ of certiorari

10

to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit,

11

and it presents what has become a perennial problem of the

12

kind of information you need to get a search warrant and how

13

courts and mgistrates — magistrates and courts, I should say —

14

should interpret, them.

15

The particular aspect of the question which this case

18

present is what law enforcement officers are supposed to do

17

when they get information from someone who has not given in-

18

formation in the past and who is unwilling to let. his name be

19

used but who nevertheless gives information which a responsible

20

law enforcement officer feels he cannot ignore.

21
22
23

Q

Is it clear and do we know in this case that the

informant had net given information in the past?
A

Well, we don't know except that considering the

24

many, many cases in which reliability is placed on the fact

25

"1 have now received information from an informant who has
2

1

given information in the past,”

It is hard to believe that if

2

he had an investigator would not have said so,

O

Q

lieve that,

5

A

Pardon?

6

Q

I)o you thinly it follows from what we do know in

*~a>

I Jail , it is not necessarily hard for me to be­

7

the record in this case that we have here clearly an informant

8

who had not given information in the past?
A

9

Yes, because -- he may have been an extremely

10

careless operator, X don’t know, but the fact is that as one

11

goes through the cases, particularly since Spinelli, but since

12

McCray vs, Illinois, there is case after case in 'which it is

3
14-

5

m

almost a formula, "I have received information from an in­
formant who has in the past been proved reliable," sometimes
with the added statement of "he has given specific information
about instances." but it is hard to believe that particularly a

7

federal investigator 'who had had information in the past from

IS

this informant would not have so stated if in fact he had done

9

so.

And certainly at least we have to fake this case, since

20

he did not claim to have had information in the past, as repre­

21

senting the situation of an informer who had not given informa­

22

tion in the pas ;,

23

Q

And here X gather the affidavit identifies the

informant as a person, does it not?

As a person, yes.

•the looks of tie affidavit.
Q

5

Well, the detective is an informant, he examined

6

him and got an affidavit from him under oath as to what he

7

encountered.
A

8
9

I was just about to say that.

And the particu­

lar problem comes here in relation to someone who had some

10

connection with the defendant because he purchased liquor for

11

him.

12

come about in all kinds of ways„

13

formant is a very important problem in law enforcement because

14

it can come at the one end from a completely responsible

15

eminent citizen who happens to witness a crime.

16

ordinary citizens who simply feel they have seen something

17

that causes them to make reports.

18

But the problem, as the brief in this case shows, can

20

Q

The problem of the first in­

It came from

Police get information —-

I just wondered, what is this having found this

parson to be a prudent person, what is that?

21

A

Well, Your Honor, I think in context it means

22

credible.

23

but it seems to me the opinion below in that respect, in that

24

little respect, in the example of how not to read search

25

warrants, and E don’t know whether that is colloquialism or

The court says you pay no attention to it at all,

4

1

not.

2

as we get from "X have received information from a person

3

who fears for their life and property,"

4

in English,

5

think when it is read in context, "I have interviewed this

6

person and found him to be proven," that means I found him in

Obviously this is not a master of the English language

He wouldn't get an "A"

But 1 don't know that that is the question,

I

my judgment to be somebody whom I trust.
8

Q

That is the same as saying

9

A

Well, I don't think he is saying reliable.

I

10

think he is saying I offer you my judgment that this is a person

11

whom I can trust and that gets us to this problem, one gets

12

information from a person who has not given information in the

13

past.

14

Now, the one thing that is clear about this affidavit

15

on page 4 of the government's brief is that the informant is

18

talking from personal knox^ledge.

17

person has personal knowledge — and I am quoting — "of and

13

has purchase illicit whiskey from within the residence

19

described for a period of more than two years, and most recently

20

within the past two weeks, has knowledge of a person who

21

purchased illicit whiskey within the past two days from the

22

house, has personal knowledge that the ilicit whiskey is con­

23

sumed by purchasers in the outbuilding known as and utilised as

24

•the 'dance hall,' and has seen Roosevelt Harris go to the other

25

outbuilding, located about 50 yards from the residence, on

What he has said is this

1

numerous occasions, to obtain the whiskey for this person and

2

other persons."

3

So that this case is clearly distinguishable from most

4

of the situations that have come before this Court where we do

5

not know the basis of the informant's knowledge, and we do.

6

is personal knowledge, and true the personal knowledge stopped

7

at two weeks before the day, but that this is not still in­

3

formation is alleged ■— I think it appears anyway from the

9

nature of the business

it

bat the fact that he knows, the

10

informant knows somebody who bought whiskey two days before

11

the date of the affidavit,

12

that is to show that the business is still going on, not just

13

a presumption but that information adds that.

I take it the only importance of

14

Q

The only problem that, they ought to see is the

IS

informer in the case?

16

A

That11 s right.

17

Q

That is the only issue?

18

A

That is the only issue in the case.

I take it

19

that the informer had given his own information in his own

20

affidavit by name, and it would not be hearsay, it would be his

21

own affidavit, is no question that the search warrant could

22

have been issued on that.

23

Now the question is should it be different whan the

24

informer is afraid or unwilling or for some reason will not

25

make the affidavit to the magistrate but is willing to make
6

1

this sworn statement to the investigator.

2

Now, this isn't —-

Q

Well, an informer wouldn't make a sworn affi­

4

A

No, a sworn verbal statement is what it said.

S

Q

I swear that —

6

A

What it says is — has given under a sworn verbal

7

statement the following information —- let's assume it. is not

8

sworn, I think that is not the issue.

10

affidavit to be presented to the magistrate.

11

tion which does arise, it is frequent, the court has recognized

12

time and again that informers who must reveal themselves will

13

not talk, so that this is a practical situation in which the

14

law enforcement agencies must deal with, and the question is

15

what do they do about it.

IS

This is a situa­

Now, opponent says when you gat this kind of informa­

17

tion, you go out and make a buy, but you will notice that the

'18

affidavit does say on page 4 that "Roosevelt Harris has had a

19

reputation for over 4 years as being a trafficker...and over

20

this period I have received numerous information from all types

21

of persons as to his activities.

22

located a sizable stach of illicit whiskey in an abandoned

23

house under Harris1 control during this period of time," and so

24

on.

25

Constable Howard Johnson

But the fact that for four years they had known about.

7

this and haven’t been able to make a buy suggests to me that
it isn't quite that simple.

There is any case ir. which you

can go and corrcborate an informer's information by making a
buy or an equivalent.

And of course there are many situations

when you have first informants where that is impossible.

You

get word from a hotel maid that there is a gun under somebody's
bed and he may be gone tomorrow,, this is something one has to
act on.

And when you get word from an accomplice, which is

the situation in. several recent cases, that the diamond that
he stole is about to be sold to a Mr. X down the street, you.
have got to act.
Q

Well, surely this isn’t that kind of a case?

A

Mo, this isn't that kind of a case.

Q

This was over a period of four years that this

man had been —A

Yes, but in a period of four years they have not

been able to make a buy.

All I cim saying is that they had not

— it isn't that simple to say, well, go out and make a buy and
corroborate the informant.

Obviously fox' some reason this is

not an easy case -— this has not been an easy defendant.
Q

This was in the Eastern District of Kentucky.

In what town or village or city, do you know7?
A

I think it is — I don't remember.

Q

1 suppose it is a very small community, it

might be hard for a law enforcement officer or his agent to
8

make a buy because I suppose it would be presumed that every­
body knew everybody else in that community and so forth.
A

Right.

Q

Is -that your point, that —

A

I don't know.

I know nothing more about this

case than appears in the record.

There are two things that

appear in the record, one that they had the information over
four years and acted apparently the day they got somebody who
had personal knowledge so that I assume they hadn't been able
to do it very easily before and the other thing that appears
is that the statement that the informant says he fears for his
life.

Those are the two things that appear aggressive.
The tract is, however, that there are then lots of

situations — not this case, but there are certainly many in
the list that nave to be considered beyond just this case as
to what does one do about first information where either be­
cause of time sr circumstances corroboration -- you can't have
a long investigation for corroboration ,
And one of the first things I think one has to ask
himself with ragard to this question is what would be the
motive for an informant to lie.

I understand that an informant

might have a motive —■ it seems to me two motives.

One is if

he is an accomplice or somebody involved, is arrested, he wants
to do something for himself.

If I give information to the

police maybe they will go easy.
9

And the other is a grudge

against a particular person.»
Neither of those, it seems to me, involves a motive
to lie, particularly in the nature of a search warrant, because
you are not going to accomplish anything for the police and
therefore for betterment of yourself, or you are not really
going to get the man you have a grudge against in jail if you
send the police off on a wild goose chase.
So the informant, by a grudge, or by wanting to
better himself, has a motive to give correct information and
probably wouldn't do it unless he had some motive of that kind,
assuming he is not the good citizen but the person involved in
crminality in some form or other.

But I hcive been trying to see

what benefits he would gain for himself by lying and I frankly
have not been able to think of any.
But assuming that even so we need some determination
as to the honesty of the informant.

The question is how do you

get it if you can't for some reason have a further investigation
or a further surveillance, and you do it at one end or the
other, either what do you know about the person who gives you
information or what do you know about the person informed
against.
How in some cases, I take it -- not this one — in
some cases, 1 take it, you can say I have received information
from a respectable citizen who had absolutely no motive to lie,
that he has personal knowledge that such and such occurred.
10

It

1

seems to me something a magistrate could properly give weight

E

to in determining whether to believe an informant who accord­

3

ing to reports speaks no;; on hearsay but. on personal knowledge.

4

Wow, one just has to bear in mind in that situation

5

that the more you describe the informant the more you tend to

6

identify him.

1

from a hotel maid who was there at nine o’clock in the morning

3

or something like that, he is identifying —- it isn’t very hard

9

for anybody who wanted to to find out who that hotel maid is„

IO

If an investigator says I got this information

Wavertheless I do think that in some situations an

11

investigator could probably say I have received a report from

12

a citizen who had absolutely no motive to lie who is well

13

regarded in the community.

14

all I guess he thought he could do.

15

viewed this person, received his statement undes: oath, and I

16

am giving you my judgment that he is a credible person.

Would it make any difference in your approach if

23

the informant, the first time informant, refused to give his

name to the officers?

25

A

Yes, I think it would.

11

I think that these are

1

all nuances that we have to consider.

2

more specific, that’s right, it would strengthen this affidavit

3

at that end if the officer said this man gave me his name and

4

address and a sworn written statement.

5

He gave him a sworn oral statement

himself.

7

don't give a great deal of weight to what was said about the

better than the commissioners do now, certainly in the ones

19

where you have full-time magistrates, are going to know the

20

character of the investigators who regularly come before them,

21

consider, whether as long as they could swing thing — I don't

3

only way they could know that is from people bringing them

information.

5

A

Yes, because the —•

"reliable informant"?

11

the others?

A

I don’t know the reason but —

I wonder why he was more reliable than all of

Well, this is the one who was willing to say I

13

have personal Knowledge.

I don’t know what else they had.

14

Unfortunately it is true that people have reputations, I guess

15

in much bigger crimes than this, Mr. Justice, but a lot of

16

things we know that we can't prove, and that brings me to the

17

second and what I think is the; more important part of how do

18

you believe the informant in this case, and that is the state­

19

ment that we have heard about this man for four years and we

20

found -- and orce we found whiskey in an abandoned house under

21

his control.

22

where the informant speaks from personal knowledge, we are not

23

dealing with a very informant like Spinelli, we are dealing

24

in a situation here where the informant speaks from personal

23

knowledge and the question is should we believe him or not.

And I at least in the situation we have here

13

1

In that situation I do ask this Court to modify the language

2

of Spinelli to the effect that reputation is really a matter
of bold suspicion having no weight whatsoever„

4

This Court said as long ago as 164 United States

5

that good reputation can make the difference between innocence

6

and guilt in the trial of a case.

7j

Court have sale, that reputation is something you can consider

8 i in probable cause.
9
50
11

i

Q

And prior decisions of the

And actually in the trial of the case —

What language expressly in Spinelli is it tha£

you find yourself uncomfortable with?
A

The fact that defendant there had a reputation

12

as a gambler was "a broad and unilluminating assertion of

13

suspicion that is entitled to no weight in appraising the
validity of the magistrate’s decision to issue a warrant."

15

This is contrary to Brinegar, to Jones, to Rugendorf.

16

say, it is contrary to the old Edgington case about good

17

character and really we keep bad reputation out of a trial, not

18

because it is irrelevant but because too much weight could be

19

attached to it through a jury.

As I

20

And so it seems to me that at least in a situation

21

here, as I say, there they were dealing with an informer who

22

speaks through personal knowledge, certainly at least in that

23

situation, and the question is merely can we act on this per­

24

sonal knowledge even though we don’t know this man, and we

23

haven’t dealt with him before.
14

You consider the fact that the

1

person he is informing against has been the subject of a lot

2

of suspicion.

■C*

it is particularly true in fields like liquor and narcotics,

4

where reputations are generally -- have some backing.

5

tainly it is true that it is possible for somebody to have the

6

name without the game, but it is extremely unlikely with rela­

7

tion to premises where liquor is sold, and therefore when you

8

get, as I say, not a very kind of suspicion, not a tick, but

9

an informant who at least to the officer is willing to make

And if I have to narrow it beyond that, I guess

Cer­

10

statements under oath, then it seems to me whether you — and

11

•the issue is, as Mr. Justice White said at the beginning, you

12

believe your informant, you have the fact, which is what this

13

case presents, that as far as 1 can see he would have no

14

motive to lie even if it is assumed he had got into trouble

15

when he talked to the police, it would still do him no good
unless the information he gave was —• turned out to be lies.

11

If he sends the police on a wild goose chase, that doesn't

IS

help hirn.

19

Secondly, the officer is willing to swear1 that he has

20

examined the man and found him a credible person; and,

21

thirdly, the person informed against is someone who has had

22

this reputation.

23

could not really get a way of checking the information.

24 1

I take it they were trying to get and

Mow, let’s not forget that this isn't guilt or innocence.

25 I This is simply a presentation to the magistrate for authority

15

I

to go in and look at the premises to see whether this reputa­

2

tion and the informant's information together are accurate,

<p\
4*^

whether there is in fact illegal activity concealed here.

4

Q

Miss Rosenberg, I think the trouble with it not

5

being guilt or innocence, I understand that in moonshine

©

cases if you move a motion to suppress, you have had it.

7

A

Well, that is true, Your Honor, but the fact

8

remains that they didn't find the whiskey and that is the end

9

of that for the government.

10

11

Q

But the fact that you find it doesn't validate

the warrant.
A

12

No, the fact that you find it doesn't validate

13

the warrant.

14

this informer had some motive which might conceivably — had

15

some reason why he was willing to talk to police, and

16

apparently a lot of people weren't, the fact is that he would

17

have no motivation to give false information.

18

thing to gain by giving accurate information, if he hopes to

19

gain anything, than by giving false information.

20

Q

What I ara saying is that even if we assume that

He had every­

I suppose you would probably say, wouldn't you.,

21

that an informant tells people that liquor is in a certain

22

place, there it is, and if they go there they will find it,

23

they go there and they find it, it wouldn’t be easy to con-

24
25

/ince you, would it, that the informant was not "worthy of
belief?
16

1
£

A

No.

Unfortunately, the magistrate who has to

issue the warrant just doesn't have that
Q

3

They don't have to try the guilt or reputation

4

for truth and veracity of all the witnesses in a search warrant

5

case, do they?
A

6

No, Your Honor.

I think there is no question

7

that if this informant had given them an affidavit, this case

8

wouldn't be here.

9

is unwilling to give his name to the magistrate, and the

The point is that you do go to the man v;ho

10

question is how much more in the face of that, what do we need

!1

to corroborate it, and I say that this corroboration can come

12

in different ways.
I take it if you cou3.d really say to the magistrate

13
14

this information comes to me from a leading citizen of the

IS

town, who has absolutely no motivation to falsify, then it

16

wouldn't matter whether the person informed agciinst had a bad

1?

reputation or not.
Q

18

Wouldn’t it be to go out and get two or three

10

witnesses who would swear to the magistrate that these people

20

have a general reputation for being truthful, for telling the

21

truth?

22

24
25

A

l take it

Q

That is so, isn't it?

A

'fell, it gets awfully complicated because if

there is a motive, if there is a real interest in keeping the
17

1

identity of the informer secret — and this Court, has recog­

z

nized that time and again

3

swear to his reliability because that would reveal him im­

4

mediately.

5

There is a real movement on in this country to up­

8

grade police investigations.

7

Q

To do what?

8

A

To upgrade.

But it seems to me in relation to

this matter of warrants that those who must deal with the

9

police and sort of train them must make them understand what

10
11

then you can’t get people to

Now, I think it is possible to make law enforcement

agencies generally understand that you can’t barge in without

a warrant, that you can't barge in on just reputation, because

that is not enough.

16

times find this very exasperating, you know they want to act

17

in a hurry, but I think here are principles which can be ex­

plained and understood.

19

I am not disputing that the police some­

But I think that if we try to lay down rules that are

20

contrary to normal experience of law enforcement officers,

21

then law becomes to them something sort of archaic, a series

22

of rigid rules that they don’t understand.

23

believe that to say to an alcoholic and tax investigating

24

officer that when he gets an informant, the fact that lie has

sort of heard rumors about this place, to put it as vague as

that to him dees not seem to accord with experience,

think that it is in the long run to the interest of good law

enforcement that we uphold reasonable judgments.

in this case where the officer had information on personal

knowledge which he thought came from a credible person, but

which also coincided with a lot of other unspecific informa­

ARGUMENT OF STEVEN M. UMIN, ESQ.,

16

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

17

MR. UMIN:

Mr. Chief Justi.ce and may it please the

18

Court,

19

that gave rise to it, took place in Middlesbo.ro, Kentucky, in a

20

little shack alleged to contain alcohol on which the tax was

21

not paid, but in fact the —

The search that took place here and the circumstances

22

• Q

23

A

This was in the City of Middlesfcoro?
To the best of my knowledge it was.

24

Dansbury Avenue in Middleshoro,

2S

the place, which are in the record.

It was on

Now I have seen pictures of

19

To what extent Middlesboro

i

is a big city or not is something I am not familiar with.

2

The circumstances however are paralleled

by similar

3

circumstances in every metropolitan area and indeed now

4

suburban areas that I am sure this Court is all too familiar

5

with, the circumstances in which a law enforcement officer

6

familiar with some reputation of a particular suspect, becomes

7

on a given day possessed of information not devised of his own

8

observation but from the say-so of a layman that an illegcil

9

stimulent is harbored in a given house.

That to be sure

IO

happens probably hundreds of times a day in the metropolis of

11

this country with respect to narcotics.

12

The decision in this case will therefore affect those

13

cases greatly as wall as it will the pursuit of the illegal

14

whiskey in the back woods.
I think we can say on this record that this is a

15
16

case in which an officer got possession of information from

17

someone not another law enforcemtn officer, and not from his

18

own observations, to the effect that there was an illegal

19

stimulent in tnis case, non-tax paid whiskey on someone's

20

premises.

21

The record doesn’t show a number of things.

It

22

doesn't show with any great clarity that this was a first­

23

time informant or indeed even someone who may have been unre­

24

liable in the past.

25

magistrates interpret search warrants, affidavits for search

To be sure, this Court; has counseled that

2

would have common sense suggest first that prudent means re­

3

liable t perhaps not credible but reliable, and secondly —
Q

4

The government here

Suppose the case was up for trial before a

S

jury and they put on this same informant, would it be up to

6

the government to prove that he had a good character for

7

truth and veracity?

8

A

No, it certainly wouldn't, Your Honor.

9

Q

Suppose this affidavit for the application of a

10

search warrant had indeed used the term "reliable, trust­

A

!2

Yes, Your Honor.

That of course is not this

13

case, although 1 thin]?, it would be insufficient under this

U

Court's standards in Aguilar.

15

of case.

Aguilar was precisely that sort

16

Q

Then you are not standing on the word imprudent?

17

A

No, I am certainly not.

In fact, I would plan

18

to assume though not concede that this is a first-time in­

19

formant for purposes of the argument 1 would want to make.

20

Q

But he was reliable?

21

A

Of course not., Your Honor.

22
23
24
25

There is nothing in

this record to suggest that.
Q

Do you suggest that prudent negates the idea of

reliability?
A

I wouldn't suggest that it negates it, but —
21

1

particularly the informant context.

2

inference of unreliability.

It may well bear a strong

A reliable —

3

Q

Let raa hear that again.

4

A

In Idle informant context the word prudent may

5

bear a strong inference of unreliability.

6

informer may really be one who makes educated guesses about who

7

it is in the community who may well have a bottle of illegal

8

liquor on his premises because he is being paid for the number

9

of people he actually turns up.

A prudent narcotics

Having seen Roosevelt Harris

10

at a party, he said, at which illegal liquor was served, he

11

would take a guess that. Roosevelt Harris may have a bottle of

12

liquor in. his house.

13

under those circumstances to suggest to an officer a list of

14

thirty or forty people for whom search warrants may bs obtained,

15

but one such person is Roosevelt Harris.

It may be perfectly prudent for ids

16

How if it turns out that in 29 cases the liquor is

17

in fast found, the informant would subsequently be found re­

18

liable.

19

and in proving narcotics or liquor informants may well be in­

20

clined to take a guess just, on the chance that it will turn

21

•up reward or payment or whatever it is, encourages him to con­

22

tinue as an informant, something of course that this record

23

says absolutely nothing about.

24
25

But it is that one case that we are concerned about,

Q

Would that same argument not apply if the man

was on trial and

you summoned a jury and -the jury was before
22

1

you and you were trying his guilt or innocence?

2

A

And you put hirs up for his witness?

A

It indeed would but in the jury context there is

Of course, in the jury —

a thought —

IS

a search warrant but not in the actual trial —
A

Ho, I wouldn't suggest that the magistrate

17

should necessarily presume unreliability in this case.

I

18

suggest simply that the inference of reliability, knowing what

19

is known about informants, particularly in, the stimulent con­

20

text., is not compelling at all from the word prudence.

21

dence may suggest, as the Court of Appeals suggested, that a

man la circumspect.

him to dc that.

It may suggest that he is very good at

I don't suggest that unreliability is compelled

23

1

could well begin without any notion of what prudence meant ©r

2

with a notion that it meant reliable or unreliable»

3

Q

The word prudent in the context of this state-

4

ment may have a connection with the fact that the informant

5

feared for his life or property and he was being very prudent —

6

A

Certainly„

7

Q

-- in not revealing his name and so on»

It seems

8

that it could well be related to the proceeding sentence in the

§

paragraph# doesnet it?

10

A

That certainly —

11

Q

It has nothing to do with reliability or not.

A

That is the point.

12

'

I mean the context of the

13

affidavit and the context of informant behavior generally lends

14

to .the word prudence so many connotations that it is difficult,

15

even to settle ©n a meanings even more important than settling

16

on a meaning is coming up with some basis for magistrates to

17

assess whether teat judgment of prudence is correct.

18

a magistrate know what the word prudent means in an affidavit#

19

what it implies about the judgment made if there are acf in

20

fact# circumstances stated in tea affidavit to substantiate

21

the meaning of prudence in this context?

22

the function that -this Court, has historically attributed to

23

the magistrate.

How can

That after all is

.

24
25

The check before the search upon tee probaility that
the search is warranted, the check upon a judgment that a man
24

I

is reliable,,

2

define prudence in a way that would allow the determination of

3

reliability and, second, speculate In the dark as to whether

4

this man was properly determined to be reliable or prudent

5

or whichever was settled upon by the officer in question.

6

Q

The magistrate in this ease would have to first

Getting away from the nuances of prudent for a

7

moment„ what significance do you contribute (a) to the

8

specificity of the allegations mad© in the affidavit

9

what the informant told him and, second, to the allegation

as to

10

that the agent himself had gone to the extent of getting the

1?

informant t© put his information under oath?

12

A

As to the details. Your Honor, 1 think there is

13

very little yea can attribute to that in this context.

14

details in no sense resemble the details in Draper,, which were

IS

details predictive in nature®

IS

that when details given by an informant were subsequently

17

confirmed by an agent, therefore they had a chance in that

18

case not to eventuate it, the informant became more credible

19

because the information predicted was in fact confirmed to be

20

true and indeed the informant — the likelihood that the in­

21

formant was giving personal, information was increased by -die

22

nature ©f the details in Draper®

23

The

The details given pertains to the relationship among

25

I

probably observable detail, but suggests no particular knowledge

2

on the part of the informant or any particular credibility.

3

Indeed it should be noted that as to that detail the investi­

4

gator in this case didn’t even go so far# as this record

5

shows# to confirm that before applying for the warrant.

6

So the confirmation aspect of Draper is wholly out

7

of the case and the personal observation aspect of Draper is

8

likewise not here.

9

this ease# as decided by the Sixth Circuit# impairs law enforce­

The ccitical point is though nothing in

n

weigh the interest of individual security.

12

the test under the Fourth Amendment, is a search reasonableg

13

reasonable involves balance# and this Court has expressed that

14

test in Camara and in Terry as the balancing of the need to

search against the enormity of the invasion.

That after all is

In this case# a number of alternative opportunities

itself would undermine# it seems to me, the merit of the

22

a buy to be sure would be constitutional, as would the pro­

That kind of conversation with a government agent

who has received information that there is illegal liquer at

a certain place might well — and

stances would — enhance the probable cause that ha could

present to a magistrate in an affidavit.

17

the question of whether a buy was available, an available

18

technique, a buy by the informant or buy by the government

19

agent, but whether other investigative techniques in this case,

20

such as a mere phone call, would not have in fact turned up

21

enough strongly indicative evidence ©f involvement in the

22

traffic of illegal alcohol as to warrant a proper affidavit in

23

this case.

would suggest in many in­

So it is not simply

Law Enforcement ran around the neighborhood and asked the

neighbors of the informant, is he liable, is he credible, what

12

was his reputation, checked with the police t© see whether ha

13

had a criminal record or not, checked his employer to see

14

whether the employee would have any motivation in that case

15

to lie or fabricate or distort, a factor just as strong as

lying in the formation of affidavits»

17

Having gone through that process, the officer could

First of all ~-

i
12

Q

Isn't it?

Suppose that the government simply

13

put this informant on the stand and it did not put on any

14

evidence to show that he was truthful and trustworthy in the

15

community, and the jury went on and convicted him, is there

16

any reason why that couldn't stand?

17

A

Certainly if the defense has done any effective

18

job at impeaching the credibility of that witness, an oppor­

19

tunity they had at the trial but not before the magistrate,

20

that conviction can stand, Your Honor.

21

Q

That is what you are exacting, is an opportunity

22

— is getting a search warrant, a higher burden on the govern­

23

ment -than would be imposed on them to convict the defendant.

Q

7

You are

not making it on the ground that —

case is the power to call the informant before him and cross-

X understood that the hearsay rule with refer­

established hearsay rule in connection with people who testi­

Indeed the very opposite is true.

Hearsay is

16

permissible in © warrant affidavit of this kind* but it is for

17

that very reason that magistrates — and this Court has in­

18

sisted upon some assessment of the reliability of the person

commonly used throughout the country, the suggestion that this

can sign over to the police the security of persons and

their houses, not simply the security of persons in their

of the police acting upon an inarticular hunch.

This Court has said it is faced against an inarticu­
