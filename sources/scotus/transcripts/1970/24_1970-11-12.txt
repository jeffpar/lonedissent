ORAL ARGUMENT BY Elli'/ N N GRISWOLD,

4

SOLICITOR GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES,

5

ON BEHALF OF l~!LI lJ\M P. ROGERS, SECRETARY

6

OF STAT,.

7

M. GRISWOLD:

CIII~F JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Solicitor General.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it pleas~

8

the Court:

Th1s case comes here on a direct appeal from a

9

three-judge court in the Jistrict of Columbia.

The legal

to

question involved is the constitutional validity of an Act of

11

Congress relating to the citizenship of a child born abroad,

12

one of whose parents is an Alt!erican citizen.
The statutory provision in question is Section

13

14

301 (a) 7 and JOl (bl of the Nationality Act of 1952.

These

15

are set forth, beginning at the bottan of page 45 of the

16

Government's brief and continuing on co page 46.

17

to read the important portions of the statute.

I would like

Beg_nning at the bottom of gage 45, "The foll.owing

18

19

shall be nationals and citizens of th,? United States at birth:

20

7.

21

States and its outlying possessions, of parents one of whom is

2Z

an alien and the other a citize11 of the United States, whom,

23

prior to the birth of such person was physically present in

24

the United States or its outlying possess ·.ons for a period or

25

periods totaling not less than ten years, at least five of

A person bo~n outside the geographical limits of the United

3

1

2

which were after atl:2.ining the age of 13 years.
And tren '301 (b) • "Any p0rson who is a natio.1al and

3

citL.en of the Un.~teu States at birth under paragraph 7 of sub

4

section A o - t:l .:.s section shall loce hj.s nationality and

5

citizenship ,.m~esc he shall come to the United Sates prior ·co

6

uttuining the age of 23 year& and i.hal;. i'.!Ulledia.tely, follow:.ng

i'

any cuch c<Jming, be contin.iously physically present in the

8

United States for at leas; five years, provided that such

9

physical pres~nce followo the attainment of the age of 14

to

years and precedes the age of 28 years.
And I m;;.y add that there is another statute which

t2.

provides that the con~inuous presence is not broken by absences

1Z

which do not exceed one yea~.

14

to go bacl. for viaits but he must hava five years without more

ts

than a one•·year break.

So that it's perfectly possible

16

The case arises on the following facts which were

17

stipulated and thus are not the subje~t of any dispute: the

,e

Appellee, Aldo ~ario Bellei was born in Italy in 1939.

19

iather is an Italian, a native and cicizen of Italy.

20

l1 ario Bellei became an Ital..an citizen at birth and he is an

2!

Italian citizen today, and thus there is no question of

22

statelessness here.

23
24
25

His
Aldo

The Appellee's mother was born in the United States
and has always been an American citizen.

The father and

roother were married in Philadelphia on March 14, 1939; a few
4

,

•

days later they left for Italy where the Appellee was born

2

i~ December, 1939 anc the f .unily ha~ since resided in

!

taly.

At the time of the Appellec's birth, an Act of 1934

3
4

Wilf-

5

wa.s an amendment to S~ct:i.,Jn 1993 of .;he Revised Statutes and i

6

?rovided that a chi~u und~r the~e circu.~stances is declared to

7

be a citizen of the United dtat~s, but the rights of citizen-

a

ship shall not descend to any such clL.ld unless the ci':izen

9

father or c t.i.zen mothe... , a .. t..lte case rr.ay be, has resided in

in effect.

'.!.'his is p:c· 1ted on page 4A of my brief.

It

10

the United State~ previous ~o the birch of said child, and

Tl

then it goes on to provide -hat when Jne of the ~arents is an

12

alien the right of ci.\:i.zenship ,:;hall not descend unless the

13

child comes to the Un:'.ted States and resides therein for at

14

least five years cont~nuously, immadiately previously to his

15

18th birthday and unless within six months after the child's

16

21st birthday he or she shall take an oath of allegiance to

17

the United States of Amer~ca as prescribed by the Immigration

18

and Naturalization SeL-vice.
That statute of J.934 was amended in 1940, liberaliz-

19
20

1ng the time period and casting it not in terms that citizen-

21

ship shall not descend, but in terms of the stat.emant

22

is a citizer, but that he shall lose his citizenship if the

23

condttion is not rr.et and the time provision was further ex-

24

tended by the 1952 st..tute which is the one now in effe ct and

25

before the Court.
5

,,

that he

Under this statute, as I have indicated the child

born abroad with one parent

s citizen may retain or perfect

continuous yearo oometimc between his 14th birthday and his
28th bi~thd y.

And that ~~ans that ~f he has not started to

do t.b, t re idar.cc by his l.:lrd b4r .:hdny then there i.s no
7

po5sibility, i¥ the stetute is valid, that he can retain his

8

citizenship u:1der the statJte.
The Appcllee her~ has lived in Italy most of his

9
10

life, and recently he toolt up renidcnce 1,1 England.

He has

ti

made five brief visits to the United Slates, but he has never

12

~!5tabl:i.ahcd re:..idc:lce in th.is country.

On his first t•-10 tripe

in 1948 and L951 he traveled on his mother's l\lI!erican passport.
14

On his next;

15

vnited States passport and this was periodically renewed until

16

DecE.mber 22, 1962.

tt-10

trips in 1955 and 196?. he traveled on his own

In connection tli th the last two renewals of his '·

17
18

passport he was expressly advised 01 the need to establish

IS

residence in the United Statea prior to his 23rd birthday if

20

he wished to =etain his Amc~ican citi~~nship.

21

to do so, the Department of State

22

lost his United States citizenship, he came thereafter to the

23

United States in 1955, using an Italia~ passport and was ad-

24

mitted as an alien visitor.

When he failed

notified him that he had

•rhat, too, was a temporary visit.

Tllo years later in 1967 the Appellee brought this

25

..

1

2 ·

suit, contending that the cond.. tions for the retention of
citizenshir, pr -::icrib .d by

he Immigrutio 1 and Nationa:i.ity Act

3

are unconstitutional and that he has not lost his citizenship.

4

When this contention was s 1Ftained t y the Three-Judge District

5

Court, the cas

U>

the proble~ in i;hi

TherP. are, indeed, two absolutes which have domincte:l
One i. · :::emir ded in the considP.rat::.on

10

of this problem of the reference by .Judge Cardozo nearly fifty

1i

y.~r:rs: ego in the nature of the judicial proccos to the tendency,

12

of a principle to exper.d itself to tte limit of its logic or

13

to Holmes•s referen~es to carrying things to a dryly logical

14

extrene.
One of these ab9olutes is that all United States

15

16

citize.~s are exactly alike as far

17

cerned.

18

i.n any aspect of the citize;1ship of a citizen.

19

citizen is a citizen.

il3

th-lr citizenship is con-

Under this view there can be no variations wha-te,,e~
A citizen is a

The other absolute is that no citizen can be de-

20
21

prived of his citzenship except by some action which he not

22

only takes intentionally, but takes for the very purpose of
te:a:minating his citizenship.

It is clear, I think, that these

24

absolutes find some support in the opinions of this Court in

25

the cases of Schneider against Rusk in 377 u.s. and Afroyim
i

:I

7

!

,.,.

against Rusk in 387 U.S. on which the cot:..Ci: below relied.
I( tt

38

propositions are true absolutes then this

3

appeal must fai~.

4

ceptual approach is not a sound one and that there is no

5

approp:z:iate reason to hold that citizenship cannot be qualifie

6

in certain ci~cwnstances or that citizenship may be extended i

7

some cases, including this one in a tentative or preliminary

8

manner which will not come to full naturicy if certain re-

9

quirements ar~ not met.

10

My

effort will be to show that this con-

Afte~ all, here is a statute which is entirely fair,

11

rational, understandable aid fe 9ible,

Why it should be

12

thought to be unconstitutional or what provision of the con·•

13

stitution it ~iolates i9 hard to see.

14

It is wholly clear, I belie~e, ~hat Congress could

?5

have provided a condition preceding, rather than a condition

16

subsequent.

17

born ~broad with one parent a citizen could not acquire citize -

18

ship &t birth, but that he would bee=;; a citizen l:>y coming

19

to the United States and residing here for five years between

20

the ages of 13 and 28.

21

would have presented really practical pr~blems.

22

wanted to come here he would have to come as a foreigner; hE! ·

23

would travel on a foreign passport; he would have to get a

24

visa, even though special. provisions might be made for visas i

25

such caoes.

That is: Congress could have provided that a chil

i,r. Solicito-: General, where has Mr. Bel lei

been living ~ince this suit started?
A

I understand he has been living most recently

18

in England; he has not been living in t:.1e United States.

I

19

believe that apperu:s in the stipulations, although the stipula-

20

tion was entered into close to two years ago and I don't know

?.1

uhere he h.:.s been living since that time but there is nothing
to indicate that he has been in the United States.

When both parents are citizens the family is likely

24

to be an American family and it is app~opriate that the child-

There can be

no cond1.tions or quaiifications on t-.hl!ir citizensl>ip because

the con:itituti.on gives them that cit:.zenohi.p as this Court has

helcl in Kennedy against Uendoza-Martinez with respect to a

15

native-born citizen and in Schneider against Rusk and Afroyim

16

.e.gainst Rusk with respect to natw:elized citi:.:ans.

12

alternative pos.. tions.

13

citizenship in 1.1uch ca.sea io not acqu:'..red by na-::uralization,

14

but by an independent power of Congrers, the power in Congress

15

to grant citize·1ship accord;;.ng to its judgment; a power which

16

Congress has ex~rcised from the time

17

18

With res,ect to persons born abroad we mc:.y 'l:ake
We ma:{ contend in the first place if

or

the first Congress.

Over seven years ..go Congrer.s gran·ted citizenship to
Sir w.t,·,s'ccm Chu:cchill.

Obviously that; cannot be rested on the

p:,wer of Congress tc ~stablish a uniform rule of naturalization
20

And Congrc, s has pass"'d many acts granting citizenship to

21

individuaJ.s whose citizenship was doubtful, particularly in the
case of WCTl\en who married foreign1;.rs and then returned to the

23

United States.

Such a special act was once passed for the

24

daughter of President Grant.

Does anyone think that these

25

statutes were b yond the power of Congress?
12

1

Similarly, Congress has gr11nted citizenship to all

2

tte p{lople in Pu~rto Rico 1~d the Virgin Isl nds and before

3

tP.at to all t:h.:i people in Hawaii a:nd AJ.<1::;ka, except Indians

4

in Alaska wllo were e. eluded in the 1.867 statute.

S

At the last ar~~nent of th~s case it was asked if

6

Congress co•1ld give c:'..tizenship to all the people of Canada.

,

I have no doubt that it could; indeed, scrne 60 years ago 'chere

8

wa3 some talk of merger bet1>eer. the United States and Canada,

9

and if that had p=cgreso~~ further,~ grant of citizenship

to
it

would obv:!.cusl::· have been a part of it.
We have a clear example in the Citizenship Clause of

t2.

the civil Rights Act of 1866 which overnled the Dred Scott

13

case and gave ~itizenship ~o a ~arge group of citizens whom

to\

this Court has said were ,1ot citizens before.

15

Q

Am I correct in my recolJ~ction, Mr. Solicitor

16

General, that Congress has given Uni.ted States citizenship to

17

all ths descendants of General Lafayette?

18

A

Mr. Justice, I thought that was true and I

19

tried to bring it in as one of my illustrations, but apparently

2.0

it was the Statas of Maryland and Virginia which gave citizenship to the Marquis de Lafayette and his descendants and we

?.2.

could not find any Congressional statute to that effect.

2.S

course, that illustrates i=l'at an element in this case , there

24

were no provisions in the conatitut:on for the granting of

25

citizenship and ':o a large extent, cj.tizenship was thought of
13

Of

1

as a state matt.er.

Indeed, many years ago, when going through

some old p pers of a law firm that asked me to look through
3

them to "~e which should be bur.ned and which should be kept,

4

I came across a passport issued by the Commonwealth of Massa-

5

chusettG in 1844 and apparently at that time that was the

6

normal way.

7

r.itizen.
I winh X could find the Lafayette Statute and whetile

8
9

You got a state p~osport because you were a state

the Marquis' desccnda..,ts are now citizens, I dodt know.
So, Congress has the power to grant citizenship, a

10

11

power which we believe it can be said it has exercised in

12

E:Dact:i.ng Section 301 (a) 7 and )01 (b) •

1.3

ment citizenship mid there was no reason, verbal or theoretics,

t4

why it must be subject to all the absolute conceptions which

15

have been ati:ached to 14th Amend~11er,t citizenship.

This is not 14th Amend-

So, for good reasons, reasons which are surely valid

16
t7

as far as the Due Proet,sa Clause is concerned, Congress has

ts

attached the conditions of Section 30l(b).

19

such conditions.

2C'

or preliminary cltizenship or conditional citizenship.

21

is no reason why Congress could not vest it with great f orce

22.

and significance

23

wil:.h.

24

tion, except the concept that citizenship is in all cases and

25

situationo, absolute.

Our law is full of

This can be called "in-court" citizenship,

unless and until the condition is complied

There is no reason for not giving effect to that condi-

Not this case; no question about that in this

here.

20

There is no case eecided by this couYt which requires that

21

resolution and ther.e is certainly no war.ding in the constitu-

22

tion which requires it.

23

To decide the case on that ground is to beg the questio.

16

this Court said that a grant of citizenship was closely anala-

17

gous to a public grant of land and this was quoted in the

16

Schneiderman case in 320

u. s.

But, of course, a grant of lan,

including a g::ant of publ:tc land can be made conditional.

A

20

mining claim is a grant of public lani and it gives substan-

2i

16

But, beyond that, let us look at this very statute:
under Section 30l(a), 7 citizenship can be transmitted only
through a citi ..on parent "who, prior to the birth of t-.he child

This qualification goes ccrnpletely back to 1790, an

13

1~

Act of the first Congress and it was sustained by this Court

15

in Weedin agains~ Chin Bow, in an opinion by Chief Justice

16

Taft without dissent.

17

would mean that the constitution requires that l\?:,erican citize -

18

Unless this qualification is allowed it

generation after generation, even though there is no trace of
20

any connection wit.'l the Unlted States or any allegiance to the

21

United Sta~es.

~t seems an unnecessarily bizarre r-esult.

Yet, if the condi·tion of residence of the parent is

22
23

sustained, not eve:i.-y citizen has the same qualifications and

24

status.

25

And let ma g:i.ve another example, though a small one:

17

1

we are dealir,g in this case with Sect5.on 30l(a), 7.

2

Immediately before it is Sectiot 30,(a), 6 wh:'..ch provides for

3

citizenship at bi~th for (6) "a pe.ccon of unknown parentage

4

found in i;he United States while und r t'he age of five years.

5

Until shown, prior to his atta.ininq t:he age of 21 years, not

6

to have been born in the United StatE.s."

7

sible and humane ~revision, ye~ if it is valid, and I hope it

8

is, we have another instance of citizenship to a condition

9

s•lbseqaent.

Now, this is a sen-

to

The only other way to look at this problem is to say

11

that Sections 30l(a), 7 and (b} are an exerc~se by Congress of

12

..ts pcrv1er to establich a uniform rule of naturalization, bu·;:

13

that like other naturalizations, this is a process which c.o.kes

14

time.

15

and the ind:!.v.!.d\..a:i. is involved and not naturalized until the

16

conditions are met.

17

It requirao substantial proof of prospective allegiance

Xn ordinary naturalization of foreigners within the

18

United States, a five-yea~: period of residence is required.

19

In the situation involved in this case ~any of tho incldents

20

of citizenship are conferred at birth, but the naturalization

21

process is not completed until the residency requirement is

22

met and it is that process in its entirety to which reference

23

is made in the 14th Amendment.

24
25

It's true, of course, that the wording of the statut

ORAL ARGUIIE~T !3Y O. JOHN ROGGE, ESQ.

ON BEHAU,' OF THE APPELLEE
MR. ROGGE:

Mr.

Chief J·ustice Burgex· and may it

tt,

please tile Court: I will divide the tir.~ on behalf of the

15

Appel.lee with Professor Gardner of the Columbia Law School,

16

who d:i.ci the iilile brief on behalf of the am::.ci curiae Associa-

17

tion of Americe.n Wivea Married to Europeans and the American

Bar Association.

19

Counsel, I suppose, in their role of advocates, no

20

matter hOYI objective they try ~o be are going to state facts

21

a little bit differently.

22

Now, the Solicitor General stated \:hat Revised

23

16

18

statute.

19

As the Solicitor General pointed out they

And when it comes

'J.'hat's an expatriation

No-~, the Solicitor General asked what provision was

20

violated: the Du.c Proca::is Clause of the 5th l\mendmant, and I

21

am not asking for any absolute here; I'm relying upon Schneider

22

against Rusk which I say is precisely in point.

23

Schneider was not a lilth ll.mcndme?1t citizen; Angelica Schneider

24

never stood up in any United States Court and raised her hand

25

and s ,ore an oa-ch of allegiance.
24

Now, Angelica

No; her mother did that, and

1

then a statute said and ~hat statute, to be found in 8 United

2

States Code, Section 1432 or, immigra,ion and nationality

3

lawyers would refer to that as Section 321 of the Immigration

4

and Nationality Act of 1952 and it says in its very action:

5

"automatic citizenship."

6

So, wh~t I'm relting on as the case being precisely

7

in point is Schneider against Rusk and I submit to this Court

fl

that Angel~ka Schneid~r was just a~ much a statutocy citizen,

9

i.f that's what the Government want~ "to draw the di.~tir,c.:..:i.rn

to

between statutory and Fourth J\mendrr.ent, Angelika Schneider was

11

just as much a statutory citizen as Aldo Mario Bellei and if

12

Schneider against Rus,; is to be followed, the court held that

13

the section which involved Angelika Schneider to have her

14

citizenship taken away because she returned to the country of

15

her origin for three years, I say by a parity of reasoning if

16

that provision was held unconstitutional as it was on the

17

grounds that moreover while the First Amendment contains no

TB

Equal Protection Clause it does forbid discrimination that it

19

is so unjustiiiable as to be violative of due process.

20

If that decision is correct, then the provision

21

requiring Aldo Mario Bellei to come here and be here for five

22

ye~s between the ages of 14 and 28 likewise viola~es the Due

23

Process Clause of the Fifth AMendmant.

24
25

I am asking for no absolute, but I am asking on the
basis of Schneider against Rusk that where this Government has
25

1

given citizenship at birth, it can't come along under the cir-

2

cwnstances of +;his case and take it away wil:hout the voluntary

3

act of the one who qot citizenship.
Q

Supposing the statute rephrased the terms,

5

malting it a con.di .ion preceding these requirements, what would

6

your position then be?

7

A

Mr

J11:o.ticP. Harlan, r would look al th~ due

8

process clause and I -1ould apply that in the same manner in

10

const;.tutes fundam2ntal :i'ai.:,1ess at the ti;1e of the d cision

12

their phrasing; I would probably say it \ ould make ·a 9-'.{;ferenc

13

We la11yero are supposed to be careful at; draftsr:tanship and I

14

think it would mal~e a difference whether

16

I think it would make a difference in the case where

17

Congress had said: "You'l:e not a citizen; yon are going to be a

18

citizen under the performance of certain conditions."

19

would be one thing.

20

That

I think r would draw the difference and would say

21

that where it's a condition precedent, that's one thing, but

22

where it is a condition subsequent, ~here Congress says as it

23

did in this case: "Your are a citizen at birth,":.: would then

24

say you can't come along later under the Due Process Clause of

25

9

A

Precisely in point, if You~ Honor please.

10

Q

I'll ask of you, then, th~ same questions I

asked the Solicitor Gener.al: do you think if this case is

In that connection, I think Mr. Justica White

American citi3enship at birth, and there is no doubt that

No; I'm placing mine plainly and simply on

the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

6

that if my understanding of Schneider against Rusk is correct,

namely: tha~ Ange_ika Schneider. never stood up and took the

And I do say

that; her mother did.
And, as far as protecting the interests of this

Mr. Chief Justice -Q

-- I don't think there was really any argument;

I was really asking a question.
39

1

A

There are two possible arquments that could

2.

be used to su tain our position: one i.F.S that Congress has no

3

power to take away citizenship without consent.

4

argument is the one which this C.:iurt tffirzns today and we

5

believe that is w,u,t it said in Afroyui, then no condition si;b •

6

sequen.;, e'> en of tl e kind that was put to ma, is possi'.,le.

1

If that

Alternatively, the Cow:t r:iid1t wish to go less far

8

tl.':ld say th t if there is a cond.!:\::ion eubsequent it must be one

9

which bears directly on '.:he '.nt<"ntion of '..he person with res-

to

pect t~ his citizenship.

!t

is unraason~le because in Schr,eider the Court said there:

t2

ree:i.dence is not a badge of

13

We -cl.,im the residence requirement

llegiance.

In answer ·:::o the question on that ground i t would

14

s~-a to me that no condition subsequent would br, appropriate

15

even the oath of allegiance although it would be possible to

16

distinguish l::.hat f~om the residence requirement in this case.

,1

Among ~e Amsrican children that are subject to this

18

rosidcnce requirem~nt,

a daughter cf a retired colonel in

19

the u. s. Army, a young lady who is presently in California in

20

an attempt to comply with this requirement, whose parents

21

cannot join her because her grandparents are ill in Paris a~d

22

her father, retired from the Army, is employed there.

23

And finally, in this class of persons affected by

24

this decision is a young man or rather three pe~sons, three

2.5

young people who ars the gr~at grandchildren of Charles Evans
40

t

Hughen.

2

So,

t ~.ssue today arec the c5. t · zenship of the direct

3

descendants of people who helped build America, of youngsters

4

of value who will contribute to the future of Amerj.ca and of

5

children of American citizens who hava spent their productive

6

years in th~ service of America.

8

llas your organization made any effort l:o get

Q

Congress to change thP. la~rs?

th6 mcmbern to ~o tha~.

13

I'm informed by

co-counsel the.t there has been an atter-:pt there by some of

I s·..ibmit that theJe foreign born children are the

14

victims of invidious discrimination.

15

parents who happens to be born in the United States during a

16

brief visit of those parents can go back to their native land,

17

grow up in a home in which English is not spoken, in a foreign

te

home and remain an American citizen for the rest of his or her

19

life without any residence requ'.rernents.

20
21

u

A child of two alien

And what• s the sourca -- by virtue of what

does that occur?

22

A

The 14th Amendment.

23

u

So that it :.sn • t an Act of Congress; is it?

24

A

That is correct.

25

But, we're claiming that this

is a discrim... nation wl'ich vj.olates the Fifth Amendment; it's
41

t

unjustifiable and it seems to me indefensible that the child

2

of those alien pa::-ents be cor,sitlered an American for the rest

3

of his life without a need of residerce rere that the child

4

of naturalized American pare11ts can reside, under Schneider

5

versus Rusk fo~ the rest of his or her life abroad without a

6

residence requirer.ient, but this class of Americans is subjec~c<

"I

to this res~.dence requirement.

8

g
10

This seems to us precisely a discrimination so unjl•.stifiable so

clS

to be violative of due orocess under

Bolling versus Shaw.

11

Now, th::.s discrimination imposes great hardship as

12

we have tried to develop in our brief, be~ause it means tnat

13

t.he child c.i.n cn:.y retain his or her citizenship by coming

14

back here e;,.ther during the early school years, which would be

15

harnful in educab.onal terms and a gr~at expense, with long

16

separation from family or at the university level and wa know

17

what the costs of education are; this could mean four or five

18

or more thousand dollars per year; or it would mean giving up
the possibility of post-graduate studies or jobs or careers

20

immediately after graduation from the university.
It is

21
22
23

24

25

a discrimination that bears particularly heavi y

upon middle and low income families who cannot afford to fly
the mother back here to have the child brought in this country
or send the child back for schooling for five years in this
country.
42

t

To give one example only, or p~r,\aps two examples

2

of the unfairness of this provi~ion, it has been brought to

3

our c:l::~en ... ion that there are ca:::es where a child was born

4

,!.broad of an AIUeri.can father and an alien mother; the mother

5

nubsequently became naturalized in this country; the child

6

could not becoroe naturalized because the child was already a

7

citizen at hirth and thus tnat child is subject to a disabilit}

8

to which i: would not have been subject had it become natur-

9

alized with the mother.
Another anomaly is that here we have people who have

10

11

in a nwnber of cases, as in the Bellei case, been willing to

12

serve in the Armed Forces of the United States and uncondition

13

ally make the supreme sacrifice for their country and yet they

14

can be told e1en if they do serve, th'lt t.1ey are no longer

15

citizens of this country.
Q

16

If I may interrupt yo'.l on that last comment,

17

becauEe I saw it in the brief also; isn't this demanded of

18

resident aliens just as much as of citizens?

9

to

does it not?

A

Well, that ·nvolves 14th Amendment citizenship,
The reliance upon that opinion was put squarely

16

it was said, "W= l1olc1 that the 14th Amendment was designed to

Well, I would make the argument whether or not

he was willing to enter the service of his country, but the
fact is that in this case he did and in many of these foreign
born Americans are prepared to accept this obligation .
Q

I guess this brings m~ back again to inquire

whether the arg=ent, then, has any particular merit in this
context as to whether he is willing or is not willing, because
if you prevail you benefit either class.

Do you think, Professor G~rdner, that Congress

could constitutionally provide that upon failing to report for

of conditJ.on 3Ubsequent that you were challenging before?

9

A

Or is that the sai_n_e kind

Well, 1 think we would say under our theory

10

that Congress Ci!lnnot take away citize1ship for any reason that

11

under that line of argument that condition subsequent wo~ld

fail and I would think under the Mendoza-Martit>cJZ case there

13

might also be problems and other cases decided by this court.

14

Q

That ~ends to undexmine, at least to some ex-

15

tent, doesn't it, your argument on having all the burdens of

16

citizenship?

17

A

Well, I don't think so, Your Honor --

Well, if it rejects the burdens and you say the

19

United States Government can do nothing about it, it has re-

20

jected one quite important burden; hasn't it?

21

A

That is correct; that is correcti but there are

22

other burdens such as subjection to judicial process under the

23

Blackmer case, the paying of taxes and other things.

24

a whole collection of burdens here which would be very difficul

25

for these foreign-born Americans their first 23 years to avoid.

citizens at age 21 upon co;nplying with ::he residence require-

11

ment is a very different thing to strip them of their citizen-

,2

~hip and re dirg the deci3ions of this COlrt over the years

13

one sees two fundemental reasons for this: first, the unfair-

14

ness of taking enay c:.tizenship once vested, given the willing

1,ess, the fac~ that the people have a::cepted for 23 years

16

right& and obligations, ond second that the danger of taking

And finally, if it please the Court, the second
pillar of the argument we're making io that the Court held in
Schneider versu3 Rusk that a residence requirement for
