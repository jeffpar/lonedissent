ARGUMENT OF PETER L. STRAUSS, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

We will hear arguments in

if I may, I should like to“take just a moment to correct a couple,

12

I think, factual overstatements regarding the case just con­

13

But

My understanding is that the stays that are in effect

15

concerning the mail received by The Mail Box in this case were

concented to

on behalf of his client.

impression, the original orders in this case came on as a result

19

of unsolicited advertisement which postal inspectors received

from The Mail Box.

or at least not opposed to — by Mr. Fleishman
And while he may have given a contrary

may be brief.

24

of the character suggested by the advertising exhibit reproduced

25

at pages 58 and 59 of the record.

The appellee advertises and sells through the

A Section 4006 proceeding was

1

brought against The Book Bin, alleging that one of these publica­

2

tions, entitled "Models of France," was obscene.

3

1969, the Government set out a Section 4007 protective order in

4

the United States District Court of the Northern District of

5

Georgia.

And on June 6,

Appellee's counterclaim for an injunction forbidding

6
7

enforcement of Sections 4006 and 4007 was made.

A three-judge

8

district court was convened and granted the counterclaim.

o

court found the procedures for examining mail possibly connected

The

with the challenged publications were overbroad and that the

11

procedures generally failed to meet the standards of Freedman v.

12

Maryland.
On the Government's appeal this Court noted probable

13
14

jurisdiction on March 2nd of this year.

15

If I may turn first — and I note your question, Mr.

16

Justice Harlan, regarding scope of relief in this case remains

17

open and is perhaps the most serious of the questions in this

18

case.

19

cedures of Section 4007, the operative procedures as it were,

20

the procedures that were put into operation because the scope of

21

the relief question is really shared with Section 4006.

22
23
24
25

But I do want, first, to examine briefly the other pro­

Section 4007, as I stated at the beginning of the prior
case, is basically a reference to Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of
Federal Procedure.

It entitles the Government to get interim

relief against the distribution of the magazines of this type or
3

1

against fraudulent enterprises in circumstances in which such

2

relief could be obtained under Rule 65»

3

things, that the proceedings cannot be ex parte and, therefore,

4

the consideration which principally, 1 think, animated this

That means, among other

S Court's decision — or the concern, I should say, in Kingsley
6

Books and subsequent opinions construing that case, is absent.
In addition, there is the necessity of showing probable:

7

8

cause in two respects:

First, to believe that the magazines are

9

obscene, and that would be a judicial finding; and, second,

tc

probable cause to believe that, indeed, the Government will be

It

irreparably injured, that there is some need for emergency relief
And Kingsley Books spoke to both of those issues.

12

The

13

Court said, at page 440 of Volume 354 before the court, authori­

14

zation of an injunction pendente lite as part of this scheme

15

during the period within which the issue of obscenity must be

16

promptly tried and adjudicated, in an adversary proceeding for

17

which adequate notice of judiciary hearing and fair determinatior

18

are assured is a safeguard against frustration of the public

19

nterest in effectuating the judicial condemnation of the obscene

20

matter.

21

business offered by the limited hazards of piecemeal prosecution

22
23
24
25

It is a break on the temptation to exploit a filthy

sale by sale of a publication already condemned as obscene.
And I think Mr. Justice Harlan in his concurrent —
or am I characterizing it accurately -- his dissent, rather, in
A Quantity of Books stated the grounds that were important to
4

1

that decision and to the distinction of that decision that was

2

made by this Court in the Marcus case -- first, that the Court

3

could exercise an independent check on the judgment of the

4

prosecuting authority at a point before any restraint took place,

5

second, that the restraints ran only against the main publica­

6

tion; third, that no extensive restraints were imposed for an

7

adversary proceeding; and fourth, that the New York Code required

8

a decision within two days of the trial on the obscenity question.

9

Now the only issue regarding those four statements in

10

this case, I believe, is the matter of time, and it is the Govern­

11

ment's position basically that that question is adequately con­

12

trolled by the power which a court of equity always obtained to

13

modify its judgments when subsequent events show that indeed the

14

person against whom a temporary restraint runs is being improperly

15

or unfairly injured by the pendency of the proceedings by the

16

continuation and relief during a period of undue delay.

1-*

17

In that respect I would like to clear up some confusior

18

which I think may exist regarding the relationship that we see

IS

in Section 4007 and Section 4006.

20

before a final administrative decision has been reached.

21

Once a

The person against whom the order is entered may then

24

seek review, as was done in these cases essentially.

25

issue is then, what is the effect of that petition for review?
5

And the

i
i

The Government's principal position is that that petition for

2

review operates to convert the Section 4006 order into what is,

3

in effect, a Section 4007 order, an order .impounding the mail

4

for the duration of the proceedings, to challenge the administra­

5

tive decision.

14

an appropriate stay would be issued.

these orders, after all, from Washington where they are entered
to the postmasters out in the field, and if such a stay wouldn't
be entered, I ara sure this Court and other courts would be quick
to grant one.
That is the necessary effect of an appeal, and now we
say, in addition, although we don't urge it, that if the Court
feels it incumbent upon it, it would not disturb the statutory
scheme in view of the history of Section 4007 to say that the
appeal has a more radical effect, that is, it suspends any impact
whatever of the administrative order and leaves the Government
completely dependent on its ability to get a judicial order under
6

1

Section 4007»

So that under that second reading, I think you were
correct, Mr. Justice Stewart, in your question that there would

subject to the order other than the burden of filing his appeal

Then it is your alternative -- you are talking

about your alternative construction of the statute?
A

9

No, now I am talking about Section 4007, and —

10

the Government need not wait.

11

Government cannot invoke Section 4007 before there has been an

12

administrative decision.

I don't mean to suggest that the

A

No, the purpose was to keep --

administrative procedures?
A

That's right and therefore I think it is certainly

19

appropriate for the Government to seek such an order, as it did

20

in the Mail Box case when the hearing began.

21

22
23
24
25

,

Q

Yes.

A

That, of course, would be before the decision

in the particular case.

It was a month before the decision,

so that there will be possibly a period of time during which thei e
is not yet any administrative decision.

7

There could not yet be

$

any administrative restraint, but there raay be a judicial order

2

outstanding which does impose a restraint of impounding the

o

mail and -—

4

Q

Of course that, too, is appealable»

5

A

Of course.

That is appealable and it may be

6

stayed.

It requires, as I said before, that the judge have the

7

specific materials before him and that he inspect them and deter­

8

mine that there is probable cause to believe that they are

9

obscene, and indeed that was precisely the procedure.
The Court will see we have reproduced at the rear of

10
11

our brief in this case the temporary restraining order and

So, as I say, the principal things to be said here are

that there is this need.

2

would be.

3

There is a further point that Mr. Justice Harlan has

4

averted to in some of his decisions, and that is that there is

S

involved in these materials here, unlike movies that communicate

6

ideas or political speeches that have a certain timeliness to

7

them, that the materials involved in this case really carry no

urgency of that sort whatever.

fi

The Court knows from the description of the material there is

16

against that balance the need of the Government for relief.if

11

of the statute is to be upheld.

12

Now if I may turn to what I call the Lamont issues,

13

which 1 agree were the more troublesome in the case, still it

14

does seem to me that they were principally settled by the deci­

15

sion of this Court in Donaldson, because as to this question

16

the way in which an order interferes or may interfere with a

17

person's incoming mail, it seems to me the effect of this order

18

is indistinguishable from the mail which was involved in the

19

Donaldson case.

20

As the Court may recall, --

21

Q

22
23
24
25

mail?

You say "the incoming mail."

With whose incoming

You are talking about the target of these proceedings?
A

The target of the proceedings.

Q

Or of the incoming mail of the public who send

in for this material?

<
10

2

A

The only mail that this order operates on is

incoming mail to the target of the proceedings.
Q

3

That is to prevent members of the public who order

4

this material from getting it, to that extent it interferes with

5

their incoming mail.
A

6

Well, I should say "directly operates upon."

14

It does remove

them from this one particular market.
In this respect, as I say, I think the order is essen­

11
12

It doesn't in that sense

tially the same impact and is essentially indistinguishable
from the situation in Donaldson.

I might remind the Court, and

that while it may be unusual, nonetheless in Donaldson was

5

dealing, indeed, with a magazine, Facts Magazine, Reed Magazine

6

— these were magazines with subscription lists, these were maga­

7

zines which undoubtedly had persons writing to them for proper

8

purposes.

As the case started out, the order entered against

19

the magazines in question was quite broad.

20

dently, properly I would say, alarmed at the breadth of that

21

order.
It heard argument once and then set the case for reargu

22

23
24
25

The Court was evi­

rnents specifically on the question of the breadth of the order.
In the

interim the order was modified and the Court then con­

cluded that with that modification, a modification which

I

essentially narrowed the order so that its predictable impact

2

was principally on the transactions in question and the order

3

was not overbroadf and indeed was proper.

4

The problems here stem from the necessity of honoring

5

the privacy of the mail in the sense that the Government may not

6

open a person’s domestic first-class mail out of his presence,

7

and that means if the statutory remedy is to be applied, it must

8

either be applied against all mail incoming to the person, which

9

we don't assert would be proper and do not attempt, or there must,

10

be some provision made for an inspection procedure.

And the

11

provision for an inspection procedure is what is at issue here.
X don't think it is irrelevant to point out that here,

?2
13

distinct from a case like Lament, we are not dealing with an

14

innocent party whom the Government presumes to protect.

15

dealing with an individual who has either been adjudicated or

16

whom it has been adjudicated that there is probable cause to

17

believe that he is using the mail for an illegal, improper

!8

purpose.

19

cific adjudication directed to him, directed after adversary

20

proceedings fully consonant with due process ■ that this remedy

21

22

Vie are

And it is upon the basis of that adjudication, a spe­

is applied.
Now the order, of course, is a restraint in some

23

respects, but that is a restraint which can readily be reduced

24

in its impact.

25

Commercial publishing houses and coiimiercial mail

orders regularly use special forms of address in connection with

case may be, and again that was the situation in Donaldson.

I think there is not a

Even the inspection itself, when it occurs, I might

point out need not and, in fact, probably is not in the reali­

We know that the way these publishing houses operate is on a

They do not accept orders COD.

utility, of maybe special evidence that could be introduced in

6

one way or another on various of the elements of the Court's

7

obscenity standards as they have evolved.

3

certainly in this Court's practice, it does seem to come princi­

9

pally down to a matter of inspecting the materials themselves anc.

There might be some questions of social

But I must say that

10

to the extent, of course, that that is the test, there is no

difference.

12

Q

13

I suggest maybe the judge thinks he needs a little:

more time to ponder the problem.
A

14

That’s right, and I think any conscientious judge

in that situation would take more time rather than issue the

16

order.

17
13
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

Well, I might say again that there are substantial
interests on the Government side warranting this procedure.

What­

ever certificates of age there may be in the mail is nonetheless
impossible to know whether in fact the person is saying that he
is 21, that he is 21.

If you sell this material over the counter,

you can at least make some obvious sorts of differentiations
along that score.
There is the need, I think recognized by Mr. Justice
Harlan's opinion in Memoirs, for cooperating in a sense with the
14

1

state for inhibiting the spread of this material to all states of

2

the Onion from a point obnoxious.

3

this is properly so.

4

cannot be effectively done without some form of restraint.

5

is the matter of Post Office involvement, indeed, with what is

6

an offense under the laws of the United States and the time for

7

the prosecution of the criminal case, again, is a time during

8

which the material may continue to be sent.

There are a few concluding observations that I would

Regarding this Court's decision in Stanley and the

only in Griswold v. Connecticut, but perhaps better than else­

is done.

3

I believe that Stanley was a decision about the choice

4

of means for regulating obscenity and as such the Government

5

has no qualms with it.

6

was was not that the opinion was meant in any way to interfere

7

with general Government regulations in this particular area.

8

someone suggested that the Roth opinion has proved a debacle.

9

I find it hard to imagine back to what was available on the news

10

stands and through the mail in 1957 in considering what is there

11

now, that it was a debacle at least for anyone on the side of

12

the fence represented by the person who made the observation.

13

I do not believe, as the Court said, it

But

Nor do I think that the issue of social value can be

14

equated with monetary value.

15

authors of the Roth opinion understood that obscenity was handed

16

out for no compensation, because people wouldn't pay for it.

17

Obviously it has some social value in that sense, but I do not

18

think that any value which has been suggested for it amounts to

19

the type of value that the Court was discussing in Roth about

20

value connected with ideas.

IJo one suggested that surely the

Counsel has made a great deal of our brief in Rowan.

22

Those quotes were taken widely out of context.

23

cipally quotations which the Government had felt had made in

24

its brief, one for example was from our statement of facts, page

25

and quoting from the Harvard Law Review,

The principal thing to be noted about the Government's

position in that case is that deals with a statute which has

much wider impact than on materials which this Court has held

Q

15

And in that wider

Q

What's that?

A

It is a position very much like the similar posi­

tions in the Department of Agriculture and other places defined
by the postal laws, Section 303 of Title XXXIX,

"He shall perforrr

such quasi-judicial duties as the Postmaster General may desig­
nate.

He is the agency for the purposes of requirements of the

Administrative Procedures Act."
Q

Does he have any judicial experience?

A

Well, no more than a trial examiner for the

National Labor Relations Board.

17

1

Q

We don't call them judicial officers.

2

A

They are the same.

3

Q

In fact, it would be an acting judicial office.

4

Mow I am trying to find out what the difference is between him

5

and the censor, except the title.
A

6

Well, I think the censor deals strictly with these

7

materials.

80 percent of the judicial officer's time is spent

8

passing on contractual disputes involving the building of post

9

offices.

10

Q

Oh, is that what he does?

SI

A

That is a lot of what he does, yes.

12
■13

14

And he passes;

on issues of second-class mailability, any administrative dis­
pute that may come up within the Department that has to be set­
tled.

15

Q

Then he is a judicial officer in the sense of

16

being an adjudicator?
A

That’s right, precisely.

Q

His job is adjudication and not administration.

19

A

Precisely.

20

Finally, I think it is necessary to say that the Gover"

17

21

22
23
24
25

ment does, indeed, assert that it does have the right not to
deliver through its mail some of the materials and the people
assert the right to send through it.

That may ultimately be

what is at issue in this case, although I thought it had been
settled by Roth.

It seems to me there is an overriding interest

It involves the Government in this business.

ARGUMENT OF ROBERT EUGENE SMITH, ESQ.

19

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE
MR. SMITH:

20
21

22

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court j
The factual circumstances in the case involving The

23

Book Bin are slightly different than the factual circumstances

24

involving The Mail Box, and as to those differences as to not

25

covered by my brother here I would like to mention those facts.
19

1

First, if it please the Court, the particular publica­

2

tion. involved is just one, called “Models of France."

3

advertisement brochure sent out through a postal inspector, I

4

call the Court's attention to pages 58 and 59 of the appendix,

5

has a notation at the top that he inquired and the date 2-4-69,

6

Pebrxiary 4, 1969.

7

The

Nov? in the context of this particular case what there­

S

after occurred is nothing for four months.

And then in June,

9

approximately June the sixth, a motion was filed which the

10

petitioners filed to the complaint before the judicial hearing

11

officer, as well as a motion for an expedited hearing because

12

of the tremendous danger suggested in this particular regard.

13

And then almost instantaneously a motion was made

14

under 4007 to have the court declare probable cause and the

15

material as obscene.

16

But yet four months went by under the scheme as it

17

operated by the Government's own exhibit as put into this par­

IS

ticular case and we point out to the Court the material, the

19

magazine “Models of France," which was the subject of the 1969

20

proceeding, was no more candid than the magazine this Court

21

found "not obscene," applying the Reirup concept in exclusive —

22

in the magazine case involving Exclusive, which was Central

23

Magazine Sales Ltd. v. United States in October of 1967.

24
25

So this is a year and a half later there is an attempt
to take one magazine out of an entire brochure and we suggest thait
20

?

these are separate facts and circumstances,

2

the U, S. Attorney sent a letter to The Book Bin, telling them

3

that he was going to move for a temporary restraining order,, and

4

counsel appeared at the time and shortly thereafter filed a

5

motion to dismiss the application as well as asking for a three-

6

judge court to declare the constitutionality.

Whafc occurred is

It is true in this case there was at no time any mail

7

8

stopped, because of the action of counsel in this particular

9

regard.

10

Now in that context we show this is the difference in

this case and the other case.

11

Now about our arguments in this other part.

First is

12

the concept of whether the administrative proceedings here are

12

appropriate under the First Amendment dealing with presumptively

14

protected publications.

IS

proceeding that does not have an adversary before a judicial

10

officer, a court.

We have, as we suggested, a Post Office

17

But what occurs is that the publication is displayed

18

and an affidavit is obtained by the general counsel, the mate­

19

rials are then submitted to the hearing examiner, who then docke+s

20

a complaint and goes forward from there.

2!

there is to expertise to suggest in this hearing officer.

22

have heard that 80 percent of his time is spent on matters

23

relating to contracts for post

24
25

Now in this instance
You

office buildings.

In. the proceedings at that time there is no time period
in which the hearing must be convened.

21

There is no time period,

1

as we suggest, that is required under

the decisions of this

2

Court in Teitei Film Co. and in Freedman within which there

3

must be a prompt judicial determination.

4

this regard this is a failure in this context.

And we say that in

Then there is obviously no jury in the context of

5
6

the administrative proceedings to determine whether or not some­

7

thing is obscene.

S

Mail Box case were determined by that same hearing acting judi­

9

cial officer to be obscene and, as Mr. Fleishman indicated,

10
11
12

that these were comparable to the materials in Bloss and we sug­
gest that Roth is also comparable to the materials in the Centra
Magazine case.
So, in that particular context we say that they are?

13
14
15
16
17

not

these are not appropriate procedures.

20
21

22
23
24
25

Now in the con­

text of the 4007 order we suggest that there are several defi­
ciencies in that particular section which are special to the
Book Bin case.
First is, what is probable cause or what is the prob­

ie
19

And we suggest that the pxablicafcions in The

able cause test?

There is no guide left as to what is probable

cause in the context of a 4007 hearing, because in no instance
are we talking about an opportunity, a reasonable opportunity to
be heard.

Is one day or two days sufficient?
This is not a kind of situation like Carroll v. Presi­

dent and Commissioners of Princess Anne County wherein a speech
is about to be heard that almost that evening — and there are
22

1

emergency concepts involved and there was no opportunity — there;

z

could have been an opportunity to be heard

3

hearing could have been held»

4

,

and an immediate

In this context they waited,, as we suggested, from

5

February until June and then they moved for an immediate hearing

6

and we saw that, unlike Carroll v. the President and Commissioners

1

of Princess Anne County, there was no overriding emergency and

8

in this regard

9

one or two days' notice to go in and be prepared to demonstrate

10

11

probable cause consisting of due process»

Is it

one's case?
In this particular court we also go on to the fact than

12

there is no reasonable construction that could obtain to save

13

what we consider to be an unconstitutional mail block, requiring

14

an affirmative action on the part of the addressee under the

15

doctrine suggested by this Court in Lament.

IS

The order, yes, could have been drawn very narrowly

17

and the postal inspector could be delegated to sit down with

10

the appellee on a day-by-day basis, sort through every piece of

19

mail there to determine whether or not any of the material alleged

20

to be obscene could be Released to them, and only that material

21

which was not should be released»

22

So we suggest that this, in effect, creates a chilling

23

effect or self-censorship which we feel this Court has condemned

24

on numerous and prior periods»

25

judge court suggests that under the broad wording of the statute

But the trial court or the three-

23

1

that under 4007 the United States could obtain a court order

z

retaining all incoming mail.

3

the Solicitor General, that should be somewhat reduced.

4

However, as has been suggested by

We get, in part, to the concept that Mr. Fleishman has

5

discussed and Mr. Strauss has discussed with respect to Roth

6

and its applicability in this regard.

7

individual has a right to receive material which to him is for

8

his amusement value or for the conveyance of ideology content.

9

The individual asserts that right by ordering merchandise.

10

In essence we say that an

Now it is not suggested, we say, that this brochure

11

necessarily goes to an unwilling or to an unsolicited individual

12

and then he responds by ordering a magazine.

There is a variety

13

of ways that this man can get this material.

He can buy a

14

publication that is put out by a firm, he may have an advertise­

15

ment in there and he may then say, "Send me a brochure," and the

16

brochure is sent to him in response to this.

17

the publication is sent to him after reading from the brochure.

And then in kind

18

And this is, in effect, the part of the people of

19

The Book Bin or The Mail Box trying to follow what has been

20

suggested by this Court in the Redrup case where we are dealing

21

with an individual who wants to avoid exposure to that type of

22

material, and this is the unsolicited intrusive mailing.

23

But if John Doe, a postal inspector, wants to get on

24

The Mail Box list and he wants to buy that type of material from

25

The Mail Box, and ultimately, as this Court recognized in Rowan,
24

1

there is an exchange of lists in every commercial enterprise

2

and mail order»

3

exchanged and he then gets an advertisement from The Book Bin

4

or whatever, he is not in the category of the individual who

5.

says, “I want to avoid confrontation with this type of material, i'

6

He is hot that particular person, so it is not a solicitation.

7

It is just simply widespread,, which seems to us to have been

8

suggested in the Stanley case when the Court took particular

9

pains, as this counsel reads it, to point out in a footnote a

What ultimately occurs is that this list is

tional questions presented by the plaintiff, but did note its

14

belief

15

obscenity must be interpreted in light of the widespread dis­

!6

tribution of the material in Roth."

17

that the statement in Roth concerning the judgment of

And again in the particular case this Court, the

10

Stanley case, this Court reiterated what'was said in Mr. Justice

19

Brennan's opinion in Roth, "The door barring Federal and state

20
21

22
23
24
25

intrusion into (the area of First Amendment rights) cannot be
left ajar; it must be kept tightly closed and opened only the
slightest crack necessary to prevent encroachment upon more
important interests."
And at thatparticular point there was a footnote, which
led us back ultimately to Breed v. City of Alexandria, which

25

*1

seemed to be an expression of the kind of intrusion that we were

2

talking about, that certain material could be disseminated.

%

O

Mr. Justice Stewart has suggested in Ginzburg v. U. S„

4

that unless the materials had some intrusive quality about the

5

nature of its dissemination before it should be prohibited.

S

least that is how this counsel has read the particular points.

So we will not rule this particular position that we

had many flaws.
