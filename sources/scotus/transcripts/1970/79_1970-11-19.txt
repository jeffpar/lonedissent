ORAL ARGUMENT BY SANFORD JAY ROSEN» ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

MR. ROSEN;

Thank you» Mr. Chief Justice.

1?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please' the Courts

12

1 am representing a woman who was ousted from her ' job as a

13

school teacher in Orange County» Florida because she refused •

14

to take a loyalty oath.

15

Incredibly, the oath that was first tendered to the

16

Appellant was a duplicate, word-for-word» of the oath that was

17

voided by this Court almost ten years ago in the Cramp case.
Indeed, both this case and the Cramp case arose in Orange

County.

And individuals comprising that county8s board of

The-Court will forgive counsel, he hopes, if he
confesses to a sense of des. ;je vous.

The feeling of having

been here-before is enhanced by the fact thatjust three years
ago counsel stood at the Bar -of- the Court to pl§Sd llh§

Now we have coma full circle, for we are back again

As enacted the Florida Loyalty Statute contains five

operative phrases? test oaths, we submit, each separately or

all taken together.

In Cramp this Court declared one of these phrases

at least, invalid.

Q

Would you have objected if it stopped after

the first section?
A

Your Honor, we would object if the Florida

oath were to stop after the first section.
Q

Well, we handed down a very recent decision

of this Court in order to sustain your objection.
A

Justice Stewart, Appellant requests that you

consider the recent decisions of this Court which were not had
after a full argument and briefing, but only ©n summary affir­
mance of decisions below.
Q

Well, it was an affirmance on the merits.

A

Affirmance on the merits in three cases in the

last three years? Knight, Olson and Hosaok.
Q

do you think it8 s unconstitutional for this

14
15

Court to require, as w® did this morning, seven or eight man fc©
take an oath that they will support and defend the constitution?

16
tA

Your Honor, 15ra not here to press the question

17
of whether an attorney may be compelled to take an oath to
18

support the Const!tutiori of the United States.

1 understand

19

that that question may be before the Court right now in three
20
other cases.

However, I think the case of an attorney may b@

21

distinguishable, may be different, really different from the
22
case of a school teacher, a garbage collector, a subway conduc­
23

tor, well, any number of potential public employees of the State
24

©f Florida, or for that matter, any other state.
25

1

2
3
4

We ere submitting that an indiscriminate test oath
of.all public employees is a test oath, an unconstitutional
oath for various reasons»

We could also suggest grounds upon

which this particular test oath could be voided without the

5

Court’s reaching that question»

6

submit that it would be appropriate in this case for that

7

question to be reached.

8

However, wa would respectfully

Butv taking the case of the attorneys, Mr. Chief

9

Justice, one could suggest that an attorney coming to the Bar,

10

to operate within a system of law under a constitution, might

11

well, at very least, as a symbolic act of fidelity, take an

12

oath to support the constitution.

13

attorney would ever fee prosecuted for perjury, of course, is

14

questionable in my mind.

'15

Whether or not such an

But, if cause came on subsequent

occasions to think that the oath were taken falsely, we’re

16

not quite even certain what that would mean, of course, but we

17

do believe that the case ©f the attorney would be somewhat

10

different from that of just an ordinary public employee.

19

In fact, Your Honor, we make five arguments as to

20

the oaths in this case, none of which do turn on a particular

21

phrase at issue or whether it is cast in negative or affirmative

22

terms.

23

hope to persuade the Court the time has come at least to ad­

24

dress idle underlying question of whether indiscriminate test

25

oaths, regardless of how they may be east, invariably offend

W@ propose in this argument to take the high ground and

5

1

the constitution.
Now, we would make five points in this case.

2
3
4

of them are just the indiscriminate test oaths or all indis­
criminate test oaths.
The first is that such test oaths violate the First

S
S
7.

10

Amendments, t© the United States Constitution.

Amendment rights, all such test oaths violate the Due Process
Clause of the 14th Amendment in this case, or if itss a Federal
oath, the Fifth Amendment, for lack of a hearing.
The- other three arguments we would make pertain more
specifically to the oaths in this case —

On the hearing, Your Honor?

Q

Or lack of the hearing.

Hearing on what?

And at what stage?
A

All right.

The hearing might fee on two points.

17
It8s- our submission that all test oaths have within them an
IS
element of vagueness and overbreadth.

None of them is quite

19

clear.

A layman taking the oath, if he takes oaths seriously,

20
might well wonder what the oath means.

Thera is no provision

21

in the Florida law nor in most laws, for any clarification of
22
the oath.
23
The case before feha Court is a particularly inter™
24
©sting one in this regard because, as the briefs demonstrate,
25
S

1

and the record demonstrates, this Court had, in fact, struck

2

down one provision in the oath that was first submitted to our

3

client, the Appellant.,

4

went to an attorney and was informed that the oath that she was

5

given was infirm*

In the absence of & hearing opportunity, that
clarification in this case would

never have occurred or might

In addition, if the oath is at all vague,

a clarification possibility would never occur if the person has
conscientious reasons to believe that the oath is unclear.
Secondly, a large number of people have conscientious
objections to the talcing ©f oaths.

I'm not merely talking

about whether they can swear or affirm, but they conscientiously
scruple against taking oaths.

Members of the Society of

Friends, for example, might well not wish to take any oath.
Members of the Seventh. Day Adventist sect might well not wish be
take any oath as this Court recognised in Torcaso, I think.
So, the indiscriminate across-the-board, automati­
cally operating tost oath as in this case, provides no oppor­
tunity for a parson who may have a good constitutional excep­
tion to the oath — at least in her case or in his case — to
assert that exception.

Or, it provides absolutely no oppor­

tunity for that person to explain his or her reasons for not

arguments and have made them in our brief» addressed to the
notha at issue in this particular case»

The first argument

will b® that is illuminated, by the Florida Supreme Court on
remand in -the Cramp case» ©ach-of the phrases» each of the
oaths in this case is unconstitutionally broad in derogation of
the First Amendment.

If not unconstitutionally broad» our

second argument would be that each again as illuminated or
perhaps obfuscated is the proper word by the Florida Supreme
Court» is unduly vague» in violation of the 14th tod First
Amendments.
And finally» under Florida tests of severability»

15
given the gloss that's put upon the oath by the Florid® Supreme
16
Court in Cramp on remand» any surviving p ©visions of the
17
statute must now fall.
18
How» if Tour Honors will» I'll take up each ©£ the
19
points in order.

My first point is that test oaths generally

20
are unconstitutional.

argument by suggesting what I meant by an- indiscriminate test

And certainly this Court, in Bond versus. Floyd recognized

that the state might well require of a state legislator an oath
that it could not require o£ a privat® citizen.

speaking to the oath in Bend versus Floyd, used almost' precisely
those words: "It may require an oath of a legislator that it
could not require of a private citizen."

Q

A

To support the constitution?
WEXI, this oath is illuminated by a gloss

IS

provided by the Supreme Court of Florida which is controlling

16

on the meaning of the oath new.

17
18

19
20

In Cramp on remand the Supreme

Court of Florida said; "The obvious legislative purpose in
enacting the subject statute was to prevent’the election or
employment of public officials and employees who are knowingly
disloyal to the Government of the United States, or to the

2?

State of Florida and subscribe to the doctrina of accomplishing

22

a change in government by employment of force ©r violence

23
24
25

We suggest that two words in that gloss are unclear;
unconstitutionally unclear.

We do not know what disloyal means,

and we do not know what subscribe means as used by the highest
10

court of the State of Florida.

1 took the occasion to look up

the word "subscribe8* today and 1 noted that tins first three
meanings have to do with signing a written document to under­
take it.

Jsm not sure -that that's what the highest court of

Florida meant when it used the word "subscribe.fi

X8m not sure

how far they meant to go when they used the word "subscribe , !i
and further, the word "disloyal58 or "disloyalty," does confound
me.

That's as to this oath.

Now, if that gloss were not present? if the Florida
Law merely said that all persons accepting office under the
laws ©f Florida or of any political subdivision, must take an
oath to support and uphold or to —well, "support and uphold"
will do,'the constitutions of the United States and of the
State of Florida.
Then our position, Mr. Justice Marshall, is that
oath would fee unconstitutional as to mere public employees not
in positions of sensitivity.
Q
A

Why?
If I may suggest first that it would be con­

stitutional as to legislators.

Why?

Because —

Q

Well, what

about executive officers?

A

It would be constitutional as to executive

21
22

officers in a sensitive post, as well.

Q

Because of

Article VI.

Well,» on that point in vagueness we * re not

pressing that particular point to vagueness. . The point cf
vagueness we press is the Supreme Court ©£ Florida8s.gloss on
this particular'affirmative oath* when you're dealing with the'
affirmative oath.
Butg as to her» we would still su jest that the
affirmative oath» put to a school teacher or a sanitation
employee ©r someone in that category» is an undue invasion of
their First Amendment rights.

There is no good reason why the

government should require — well» to start with: sanitation

It seems to m© the oath to affirm the Constitution

10

to 'the constitution, to the. basic system of government and of

11

law.

12
13
14
15

And it's a useful symbol and tradition to have the

President of the United States, for example, on the occasion of
his inauguration, or the Justices of the Suprema Court or other
high government officers, take an oath of fidelity to the con­
stitution to the basic document.

I assume that each man who takes the oath for

I — of course, I choose the sanitation worker as

what strikes me fc© be the most ludicrous example of the lack of
relationship between a function for such an- oath and the oath.
Q

But feh© case here before us is a school

collector; do we?
IS

16

A

In this case.

In this case you can not even

worry about the affirmative oath question, but of course, in

Cole versus Richardson, which the Court remanded last year, the
10

n
20

question has been refiled, of Cole versus .Richardson has been
refiled before the Court, and the question is being pressed
upon the Court on innumerable occasions.

In this cash we8re

21
.dealing with a schoolteacher.

In Cole, as I recall, we were

22
not dealing with a school teacher? the woman was a laboratory

23
technician, which, if the area of education

is one which seems

24
to give, rise to a reason for sensitivity as a symbolism of the

freedom? because it5s a very* very tenuous and subtle and* well*

24

very fragile nature of the academic setting.

Our second point —■

1 have .taken the oath .as a

Q

1

Mr. Rosen,, can I ask yous did the record

disclose the grad® at which your client taught?

2

A

3

She was either in fch@ first or the third

grade, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

4

Q

5

Are you drawing a distinction between teaching

6

at the elementary levels "-as compared with teaching in the lav?

7

school# for instance?
A

8

■

So far as the oath la concerned?

No# we do not.

1 concede that such distinc­

tions can be made# but we do not believe fc&ey make a difference.

9

The afeasic function of the oath is served in neither occasion

10

to the extent that the state interest may be in avoiding in­

1?
12

doctrination of either third graders or law school students in

13

subversive concepts or subversive ideas, whatever they may foe.

U

I would submit that the state has other means by which it can

15

accomplish that end without requiring teachers to g© to ignoble,
in some cases, ends in having to subscribe to a test oath.

16

The second point that we make in terms of the broad

17

base unconstitutional!fcy of the indiscriminate «test oaths, the

18
19

oaths given to all people who.somehow come within the staters

20

power, either by way of employee or one who requests a benefit#

'

21

22
23
24
25

is that because of the automatic nature of the disability, the
First Amendment rights are even more greatly invaded or the
danger to the First Amendment rights is even greater. - There­
fore, at the very least, if such oaths or such inquiry can be
made, there must be provision for a hearing as there was,

18

1

2

indeed, in the New York cases, both in Adler and in Keyishian,
some provision for a hearing

l@ast whereby the oath or the
• /

3
4

inquiry can be clarified and the applicant, or the one who is
being asked to subscribe, to the oath, may, in fact, state her
reservations.

5
6

Q

Yes.

A

The specific objection to the oath and the

7
statute in this case, the oath of Florida and the statute of

8
Florida, really illuminate, we feel, the defects of oral test
9
oaths o

20

In the first instance under the gloss provided by
11

idle Florida Supreme Court, each of the oaths, in fact* unduly

12
invades First Amendment Interests•

13
Q

Would you say your concept of academic freedom

14
would go so far or maybe not so far as to say that the school

15
or university could not hire a professor who was advising
16
students to use violence to achieve their goals in the univer­

17
sity?

18
A

No, I would not say that, Mr. Justice White,

19
but that is not the same thing as requiring all professors to
20

take loyalty oaths»
21

Q

Yes.

We'll get closer.

What•if — could they ask him when he takas his jobs

Q

8
9
10

So you would say a fortiori you couldn't ask

him: ”D© you believe in the use of violence to achieve social
*

ends?”
A

11

A fortiori you could not ask him that, because

12

that is just a belief and innumerable decisions of this Court

13

have recognised that you may not invade the protected province

14

or --

15

16

Q

1 mean that could keep him out of his job for

that and I just wondered if you had asked him that.

17

A

Well, you can always ask,

Mr. Justice White.

18

Q

Well, I know, but you are

saying that if he

1©

refused to answer they couldn't fire him?

20

A

That's right.

2!

Q

And you would say it's bad evenif the state

22

conceded that if he answered “yes," they couldn't fire him

23

without answering some other questions?

24

25

A

Well, you are trying to make the teacher's

situation look much closer to the bar situation, I take it.

Weil, I don't know whether it does orv not»

2

Which way do you limit it?
A

Well, because of the fragility of academic

freedom I would think that you would have to put a greater

protection around the teacher than around the lawyer, although

the lawyer is entitled to a great deal of protection»

Q

you could.

Because when you are asking him whether he has

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. SLEPIN?

Mr, Chief Justice and may it pleas® the

io

Courts

ii

perspective in which the Appellees5 brief was cast, without

12

abandoning any of the arguments in that brief, in the next few

13

moments l*d like to take account of Appellant’s argument within

14

tiie somewhat prosaic context of a three-fold argument, if I may.

In employing a perspective slightly different from the

The position that the Appellees are going to ad­

15

16

vance fox* the Court this afternoon are, briefly stated?'_theses

17

first we think that the Court below was correct in assuming end.

18

we think that it was an operative assumption that oaths, per

19

se, and we’re not concerned for the moment with the contents of

20

•the oath, are constitutionally legitimate, running as they do,-'

21

we think sand as the court pointed out, through the very pith

22

23

z

and max-raw of the American experience.
Secondly, we think the court wascorrect in advancing

M

that assumption to a position that governmental employment as

23

such, may be conditioned upon an oath under certain circumstances
23

1

and we will deal again with 'the content of the oath in just a

2

moment.
Secondly, we are going to take the position that the

3
4

Court was quite correct in upholding, after certain judicial

5

excisions, the instant oath that is now before this Court and

6

in the context of that. I’d like to deal with the due process

7

arguments advanced by the Appellant.And finally, I wouldlik® to advance the argument

8
9

that the court below is correct with, respect fe© the doctrine of

10

severability in holding, in effect, that the doctrine is alive

11

and is well and in the case of Jackson and as wall in the

12

Cramp case, is alive, well and resident within these very

13

chambers.

14

First of all, Your Honors, we’re going to be.

15

somewhat less

16

to -this ease before the bar at this point and we will paint

17
18

categorical than the Appellant; we want to'speak

with the brush less broad than a comet’s tail.
We want to take the position, Your Honors, as this

19

Court knows,.that Article II,Section 7 ©f the Constitution

20

itself prescribes an oath.

21

the oath which it does prescribe for the President ©f the United

22

States, is far broader, far vaguer, if you will, far less

23
24

as-

And later I want t© point out that

specific than the oath with which we are confronted in the
instant case.
Article VI, Clause' IX of the Constitution requires

24

1

that all executive, judicial and legislative officers of the

2

United States and the several states must subscribe to &n oath.
And as we noted in our brief, the first Congress in

3
4

1789 precisely prescribed an oath.
This morning I stood before this Court and very

5
6

7

proudly subscribed to an oath promulgated by this Court and
.imposed upon me by this Court pursuant to Rule S 9 an oath

8

which I want to point out to the Court, was a tri-partifee oath,

9

was far more expansive, if you willj far leas specific than the

10

oath attendant to the cause ’at bar at the present time.
In\the of Bond v. Floyd, 'this Court, held very;,

11
12

categorically, it seams to me, if somewhat offhandedly, and.1

13

quote:

14

t3A legislator, of course can be required to s'sear

15

to support the Constitution of the United States as a condition

16

of holding office.

17

tion that -the oath provisions of 'the United States'and Georgia

18

Constitutions do not violate the First Amendment."

19
20

We do not quarrel with the State’s conten­

And then finally, at page 247 of the Lawyer’s e
Edition, Bond ?, Floyds

21

”0£ course a state may constitutionally require

22

an oath to support the constitution from its legislators.”

23

And then, as Mr. Rosen pointed out, in the Hosack

M

case and the Knight case and the Ohlson case, affirmed by this

25

Court, the so-called affirmative mode of the loyalty oath was

25

1

exacted; it was sustained and this Court affirmed it.

2

In Gilmore versus James, it was si case that had t©

3

do precisely with organisational membership and that particular

4

oath or affidavit was struck down.

5

pointed out that the affirmative mod© of an oath as such, was

6

hardly repugnant to the constitution because the constitution

1

requires one in oh® place and prescribes it in another place.

6
©

Nevertheless, the Court

And then lastly, in the case of Stewart versus
Washington, which again is not on point because it dealt with

10

subscription to Title ¥ of the U. S. Cod® which was a far more

?i

involved case than the one at bar,

iz

Stewart versus Washington, the Court pointed out that the oath

13

in the affirmative mode was part and parcel of our constitu­

14

tion and our constitutional experience.

15

Nevertheless, in dicta, •

I suggest to the Court that the oath per se, is

16

constitutionally legitimate on at least two grounds; number one,

17

the Constitution of the United States in two articles admits

18

of an oath and prescribes an oath.

19

,

And then secondly, this Court, has held, and I would

20

site -the Court to the Mitchell case, and S would cite the Court

21

as well to ex part© Curtis, that governmental employment may bs

22

conditioned and■may b© conditioned in such a way that the

23

employee may claim an infringement of his First Amendment

24

rights but the Court itself will then determine, not whether

25

there has been an infringement, because in the Mitchell case
26

9

1

upholding the Hatch Act, the Court admitted an infringement of

2

several provisions of the constitution and rights derivative

3

therefrom.

That's correct.

they are willing t© do so, even though this Court has held it's

It was unquestionably done in this case.

The

I have no knowledge that it

20

error, omission, oversight or delinquency and the case of

21

Adams, which, as pn know, is to be before tills Court and

22

various portions ©£ that record are included, was a case,, in­

23

cidentally, where some of the members of the University of

24

Florida staff were employed -for some substantial period of

25

time before they were aver presented with . an oath, which is

It seems to me that it's a case of

1

very much like Knight versus the Board of Regents•

It pointed

2

out that felis oath was adopted in 1934 and I think the Knight

3

case was brought in *67, several years after some members of

4

that faculty afe' Adelphi had bean employed and now presented

5

with the oath.

6

And the Court moved very'quickly to remedy that particular

7

delinquency and to point out as did the Board of Public Educa­

8

tion in Orange County, after it was notified by counsel for

9

Miss Connell, that that portion of the oath which this Court hac

It was a delinquency in this case, Tour Honor.

administration, admittedly, tan years after the fact, to with­

21

22
23
24
25

Yes, sir*

before 'this Court is complicated, somewhat, Your Honors, by
virtue of inability to follow this Ariadne thread of the
Appellant*

The Appellant seems totake the position that

vagueness is applicable when a person is a school teacher but
vagueness fcs a. constitutional challenge somehow is not appli­
cable when one is a legislator, t© take the position that some
of the arguments apply to sanitarians but others don’t seem to
teachers, and I confess, though this is an admission which per­
haps I'm not compelled to"make, but I'm not quit® following that__
particular argument*

I am following the argument of this Court'
29

1

statement in Bond, in the three cases which it affirmed and

2

with respect to the oath I took and with respect to the two

3

prescribed oaths that government employment may be conditioned

4

upon the enaction of an oath.

5

And I might point _oufc to the Court right now 'that

6

I am persuaded that the State of Florida'and any other state

7

could exact from, a doctor who becomes an employee of the state

8

and who takes the position of an employee in one of the stata

9

hospitals, an oath making him disclaim, if you will, that he is

io

opposed to antiseptics? make him disclaim that he is an advocate

ii

of euthanasia and it3s not beyond the realm of either reason ©r

12

experience that a man who favors euthanasia or a man who is

13

opposed to Dr. Lister's discovery, who does not believe in

14

antiseptic procedures, founds it upon either religious commit-»

15

raenfcs or pi you will, a political commitment.
Morris Cohn once said, "Hot all who rave are

16

divinely inspired,” and it may be that a man is misdirected, but

18

nevertheless feels he has a First Amendment right to believe in

belief clause that survived below

There are, Your Honor, and —»

23

Q

What la your position about that?
30

A

1

Our position is that there are two belief

a

clauses and I think that’s precisely what the Appellant said.

3

The Appellant said that the affirmative mode of the oath which

4

reads as follows?

S

”1 do hereby solemnly swear that X will support the

6

constitution/5 is .in point ©£ fact, "he says /a belief oath and

7

it’s really a negative oath masquerading as an affirmative

8

oath."

B

'

"

---- ....

Q

What about the other requirement?

A

The other requirement is: I do not believe in

11

the overthrow of the Government of the United States or the

12

State of Florida by force and violence and we support that and

13

X should like to cite to the Court at this point the opinion

14

of the lower court in OhIson versus Phillips, affirmed by this

21

22

Court at 397 U.S. 317.
The Ohlson oath was an oath, Your Honor, to uphold
the Const!fcutioiof the United States and the Constitution of the
State of Colorado.

In explanation of that oath the Ohlson case

went on to say, and 1 quote;
■"The present oath is an affirmation of belief in
organic law snd disbelief in the use of force to overthrow the
government”and X think that9s quite —
Q

Don't we affirm judgments, not opinions?

A

You do, indeed. Your Honor and X am urging

upon the Court the reason of. the Ohlson Court, not the strict

31

1

words which I certainly would not claim that this Coart adopted

2

per s®.
The point 1 am making is that if the affirmative

3
4

oath means anything, to uphold the constitution, it seems to ras

5

could quite reasonably — and I think it'is preeminently

6

reasonable “-“mean that one avows a belief in organic law and

7

jthe infinite mutability of the constitution -through organic

8

process and devise simultaneously a disbelief in the utilisa­

9

tion of force and violence to overthrow the government.
Mow, the point that we wish to make in this regard

10

11

is simply this: no hearing procedure is prescribed or allowed by

12

the constitution with respect to the President of the United

out, have»a vital concern in maintaining the security of the

Now, if 1 have to swear an

oath and an oath which

X would point out to the Court requires me, not merely to up­

6

hold the constitution, Your Honor, but an oath to conduct my­

self uprightly,-/ whatever that means, to draw upon the vagueness

8

argument of the Appellant, an oath to conduct myself according

upon the enaction of an oath andthe answer is s sometimes,

depending upon the nature of the oath.

prescribed by Article II which says, "I will execute,” and

surely the President is saying that he promises -to., execute?

not that history will demonstrate that he did execute; the

Your Honor, I don't think that's the test of

But do you think there should be a hearing

A

2 most surely d© not, sir? I see no need for

there?

24

a hearing and the very interesting argument, and I think the

23

correct argument made in the Smiley and Ohlson cases, is that a

35

1

hearing has to do with the weighing and sifting and finding of

2

evidence? it has to do with<the confrontation of accusers and

3

it has to do with cross-examinationi none of which applies- to

the instant situation»

S

Q

Welly do you want to pursue your position that

s

in the case of a school teacher it is quite all right for a

1

state to bar a school teacher for refusing to answer the

8

questions "Do you believe in the overthrow of the government

9

by force and violence?”

to

A

Yes, sir.

As I pointed out, and indeed, as

11

this Court has pointed out, the state has a very compelling

12

concern, it seems to me, in the beliefs as a spring to action.

13

Surely we're not so abstractionist that we want to be exceed­

14

ingly careful so as to believe that human belief 'is irrelevant

15

t©human conduct.

16

And this Court has pointed out time and again that

17

the state has a vital concern in education? indeed, in the

18

Brown case versus the Board of Education, it was noted that

19

education is the principal business today of government.

Q

This

Sof I take it you are saying that, if they say,

23

"Yes, I. believe in the overthrow by force and violence," or if

they refuse to take the oath, saying, "1 do not believe in it,"

that right then and there that Florida may bar the pe5f®pn

It just isn81 a preliminary question?
No, sin unlike one or two of the other cases

with which this Court was concerned: principally the case of the

The swearing of this oath or., a refusal. to

Mr. Slepin, 1st roe somewhere along the line,

10

would you comment on the argument that the true .subversive

II

isn't going to be bothered, by any loyalty oath in the first

12

place?

X want you to touch on "that before you get done*
A

13

I'll comment directly on it at this point, if

14

X may, sir.

1 think it’s probably true that one who has

15

engaged in espionage or one who has an insidious purpose, is

16

net going t© scruple at either lying or taking some other action

17

which will avoid placing him in the clutches of the law or

■

j

20

And'while it seems to me quite clear, and X can

21

certainly be fooling and deluding myself if X were to take

22

any.other position, that the Florida loyalty oath, like any

23

oath, is not a panacea in terms of security.

m

23

And that the

Florida loyalty oath, does- hot " assure the school authorities
that they are having present in their classrooms, competent,

37

‘3

U

dedicated loyal people? it is a treasure, number ones which we

2

don't think is constitutionally impermissible# and therefore it

3

is a measure# as are so many measures# within the broad dis­

4

cretion of fclie legislature of the State of Florida.

5

Arid if the legislature of the state feels that this

6

is one important symbol and a symbol which may have more or

7

less utilitarian effect# then it seems to me# so long as it is

8

constitutional and permissible# the legislature of the state of

9

Florida and her sister states must be granted that leave to
impose such a symbolic oath.

10

And indeed# we would seise upon the question put

11

12

to counsel for Appellants it is# in point of fact, a symbolic

13

oath and we feel that it's as symbolic and as important an ,

14

oath as was subscribed before tills Court -this morning and as

15

the cor^itution itself requires.

18

Q

May I ask you when this law was passed?

17

A

1949# 1 believe was the. initial act# Your Honos .

18

Q

Was there anj? oath of any kind before that?

A

I'm not aware of any# Your Honor#but I

'

20

certainly wouldn't be surprised if there were some kind of oath

21

required.

for the Appellant can answer that as he rises.

Was the first one passed# the same one that is

1

Q

Or was it amended?

2

A

The same one but far more abundant because it

3

contained the provision which was excised by this Court in

4

Cramp and then contains the other provisions which were excised

5

by the court below and we’re not arguing about those judicial

6

excisions»

7

three more provisions than it now contains as it sits before

8

this Court in this case.

So it was generally the same oath but it contained

I wonder if you knew how many people have been

discharged from office for failure to sign it?
A

I have no knowledge * Your Honor, of any person

12

being discharged, other than those who are the parties to the

13

cases now before the Court.

14

Q

How many are they?

15

A

There are several thousand teachers in the

18
17
18

state; there are many, many thousands of state employees.
I’m sorry, sir.

Three in the Adams case and Mrs.

Connell in the instant case.

Three people?

Four in all, 1 think. Your Honor.

Q

Do you think maybe it was the law before 849?
I’m sorry, Your Honor.
Do you think that maybe there was a loyalty

oath before 549?
A

I should suspect that there was, but I know of
39

1

no statute prior to '49 and my research didn’t reveal one.

2

Q

3

Public school teachers?

4

A

5

Are teachers on a year-by-year contract?

‘They are until the first few years of teaching,

Your Honor, whereupon they gain continuing contracts.

6

Q

7

A

Two or three years , I believe , Tour Honor.,

8

Q

So that they would have to take this oath

S

three times?

10

A

11

That was after the first two years?

2 strongly suspect that they would, Your Honor,

yes, but I'm not at all —
Q

12

Suppose a teacher said, BAs:* of this moment

13

I am not for advocating the violent overthrow of the government;

14

but I can't guarantee what mv research and study might lead me

15

to believe." Would that be okay?

16

A

No; 1 think not, Your Honor.

17

Q

They have just got to take it that way or

I think so, Your Honor.

Q

I don't know about you, but I didn’t take an

oath that I wouldn’t overthrew the government, did 1?

A

Your Honor, 1 -- it is not given to me to

3

exercise judicial interpretations, but I suspect that the oath

4

which you did take has some very real meaning to it and I think

5

it involves a very real commitment and belief as this Court

6

stated in the Dallas ease; 'the belief means a promise.'

1

Q

•

I agree with you and 1 don’t agree with the
I most certainly don’t

8

other side that it’s just symbolis.

9

agree with that, but my worry is that hew a teacher, for example,

10

of mathematics has to take an oath would not agree with about

11

the overthrow of the government.

Well, Your Honor —•

Q

My whole point is what I mentioned before;

there is no leeway in these joints here.
A

“There is no leeway in this respect because it

applies to all state employees of every source and variety an
including the sanitarian who I hold to have an extremely impor­
tant place in society and anyone who has roamed through New York
during ‘the garbage strike is acutely arid sensitively aware of
‘that and 1 should ‘think that the state even had a compelling
interest in maintaining whatever symbolic protections it can
with respect to the sanitarians who are, in my scale of values,
is not the lowly creature who is below an oath? he’s act below
an oath and more than a teacher is above an oath, because
again, the Path itself is not an anathema, and secondly,
41

1

because this particular oath is well within what we think the

2

Court has decided is permissible.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Justice Blackman'had a

question* I believe.

S

A

6

Q

Yes * sir.
WaJ.1, perhaps it's been answered.

I was

7

merely interested in knowing whether Florida has tenure for

8

teachers; for instance: Arkansas does not?

9

A

For university personnel* Your Honor.

For

10

public school personnel* it*s what's called a continuing con­

11

tract, meaning that after they have taught for approximately

12

three years* they then go on a continuing contract and they

13

only may be dismissed for cause and there are procedures out­

14

lined for that.

IS

elementary and secondary schools and tenure in the higher

16

education area.

17

So, ife_5s called a continuing contract in the

—-

Let me just fleetingly refer to separability.

This

IS

Court stated that the rule in Jackson.

19

Supreme Court of Florida in Cramp and it's quite clear that we

20

have an affirmative and negative mode requiring an avowal of

21

belief and an avowal of disbelief ? fundamentally and probably

22

•She same avowals* if you will, and I don't think the constitu­

23

tion and I think the cases don't think that the constitution

24

anathematizes a grammatically negative oath, irrespective of

25

what the meaning of it is.

42

It was stated by tine

And I should think that this Court would not.commit

1
2

itself to the proposition that because an oath happens to be

3

framed in the negative, -then there is some superhuman command­

4

ment which says that negative oaths per se axe objectionable to

S

the constitution.,'
Q

6

May 1 ask you if that oaths.-as you interpret,

?

it, means that the person who takes it has to swear that he will

8

never, under any circumstances nor conditions, no matter hem

9

bad the government may be., attempt to overthrow it?

10

A

No, sir? I think that it does noto

I think

11

that it does not.

As I stated to this.'Court, Your Honor and

12

I trust that I*m on reasonable ground though it makes me far

13

less categorical in my statements than Appellant who challenges

14

all oaths under any circumstances•

13

concerned with this case at this time involving these parties.

16

We are not, and I'm as grateful as Your Honor is, living in the

17

Third Reich at this point, and we are not faced, it seems to me.

18

Your Honor, with the circumstances which faced a Simone Weil,

19

or some of the revolutionaries whose concern with the Gestapo

20

or who is concerned with the totalitarian state.

"It seems to me that we are

And if Your Honor asks me whether I would project

21

22

this oath into th© abstract, 1 can only tell Your Honor that I

23

trust that the parties defendant and Appellees in tills case are

24

perhaps in their own way, every bit as committee to the notion

23

of individual -liberty and freedom as are'the Appellants in this

-

But I can’t project into some totalitarian teacher

which I trust will not descend upon us and which I trust, will

4

not give rise.'to a case before this bar
Q

5
6

May I say if a man had to face that situation

he should continue to abide by that oath?

7

A

Your Hortor* I think --

3

Q

Suppose the government* and I don’t think it

9

ever will* and 1 hope it won't

suppose it should have a

10

government like Hitler — would you say that ha would then

11

have to swear that he would not fight it?
A

32
13

Your Honor* I think that Judge Learned Hand

put it well and it may be very paradoxical. As I recall he gaifis

14

"The government* any government* and I assume he meant the

15

totalitarian one, juridically* as well as our government* has

16

the right to protect itself against revolution and any person

17

. oppressed by th t government who does not have available to him

10

constitutional moans of altering that government* has a moral

19

right to do what he can to alter it.
And I think that’s the everlasting* moving paradox

with which any man in any' stata is called.
