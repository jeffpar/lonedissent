MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Callahan, yon may proceed whenever you are

ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. CALLAHAN, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. CALLAHAN:

8
9

the Court,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Crampfcon case presents a similar challenge to

to

the imposition of the death penalty for cases of murder in the

n

first degree under the Ohio procedure.

12

Similar to McGaufcha, the McGautha case in California

13

we decry the lacR of standards to guide a jury in the selection

14

of its penalty.

IS

ing that a procedure which permits a jury to consider and de­

16

termine the issues of guilt and punishment in a single pro­

17

ceeding violates the defendant's rights under the Fifth Amend­

18

ment to be free from self-incrimination.

19

We have the added feature in Ohio of contend­

The statutes involved in the Crampton case are the

20

statute which defines murder In the first degree in Ohio which

21

sets out the felony type murders and the necessity of. deliber­

22

ate and premeditated malice and also prescribes the punishment.

23

The statute says that the punishment is death unless the jury

24

recommends mercy, in which event the punishment is imprison­

25

ment in the penitentiary for life.

/

3

?

We are also bringing t© the attention of the Court

2

the statute which'provides the right of allocution to a de­

3

fendant in a criminal case.

The factual context of the

4

Crampton situation is this:

James Crampton was a man approxi­

5

mately forty years of age at the time of this incident, and

€

he had been married to Wilma Crampton approximately four

7

months at the time of the murder.

8
9

In November of 1966, shortly after the couple were
married, Crampton admitted himself voluntarily to a hospital

10

for treatment for drug addiction.

11

under a "court order" of the Probate Court of Lucas County,

12

Ohio to the Toledo State Hospital.

13

He later was confined

Shortly before the holidays of 1966, Crampton was

14

released to his wife. Wilma, on a trial visit by the state

15

hospital authorities.

16

with him to return to the hospital.

17

the family home.

18

to two weeks, during which time he was with a friend whom he

19

had met in Pontiac, Michigan and traveled throughout the Ohio,

20

Michigan and Indiana area procuring drugs with money that

21

they obtained from thefts, generally in motels.

22

In January of 1967 she remonstrated
He refused and he left

He remained away for approximately ten days

On January 17 he returned to Toledo, Ohio and came

23

to the residence of his wife, at approximately 7:00 o'clock

24

in the evening.

25

a stolen car in the streets ©f downtown Toledo with a .45

Later the same evening he was found driving

4

1

caliber automatic on the front seat.

2

— bis wife's body was discovered the following morning and had

3

been shot through the head with what appeared t© be a .45

4

caliber automatic.

S

His wife was discovered

When he came to the Lucas County Court, he entered

6

a plea of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity to

7

the charge of murder in the first degree.

8

his case before a jury, he did not testify.

9

order to support his plea of not guilty by reason of insanity,

At the trial of
He supplied, in

10

the medical records from the hospitals that he had been in,

11

both before and after his arrest, and also his mother testi­

12

fied on his behalf with reference to his background.

13

The jury had to decide at a single sitting whether

14

or not the defendant was guilty or innocent, "whether or not

15

he was insane at the time of the crime or possessed his

16

faculties at the time of the crime, and whether his punishment

17

should be life imprisonment or death.

18

The instruction given to the jury, we have no

1©

quarrel with the instructions with reference to the guilt or

20

the insanity issues involved, the instruction given to the

2!

jury on the question of punishment was, if you find the de­

22

fendant guilty of murder in the first degree — this appears

23

at page 5 of petitioner's brief — the punishment is death,

24

unless you recommend mercy, in which event the punishment is

25

imprisonment during the penitentiary for life.
S

1

The jury found the defendant guilty of murder in

2

the first degree, did not recommend mercy, and the defendant

3

came before the court and was sentenced to death by electro­

4

cution in Ohio.

S

He has appealed to the Ohio courts.

The judgment

0

of the lower courts have been upheld and this court has

7

granted certiorari on the question of the standards question

8

and what has been alluded to as the single verdict question.

9

In view of the fact that the standards question has

10

been treated in depth to this point, I will address myself

21

first to the question of the Fifth Amendment problem as it

12

arises in the Crampton case.

13
14
25

G

Can the trial judge in Ohio or the reviewing

courts alter the sentence?
h

No* Mr, Chief Justice,, once the jury in Ohio

16

imposes the penalty of death, it cannot be modified or

27

affected by the trial court or by any appellate court unless

18

there is a legal error found in the record with reference to

19

the conviction.

20

punishment falls with it.

21

22

stages in the trial and appellate procedure in Ohio.

The petitioner* Crampton, contends that he has*,

under the federal Constitution,, two rights involved in this

courts of Ohio is that the- limitation is within the discretion

Q

But to avoid this —

Mr. Callahan, Ohio — how do you. put on the

&

testimony other than the defendant that would be for sentenc­

ing purposes rather than guilt or innocence?

10

A

Under the Ashbrook case in Ohio, Mr. Justice

Marshall, it would appear that the question of punishment is

not in an issue and no evidence can be addressed by the de­

13

No, Your Honor, not directly.

New, 1 will

20

admit that In many cases in Ohio, and I think this is in one

21

©f the ©pinions written by the Honorable Chief Justice at an

22

earlier time, indicated that in many cases a plea of not

23

guilty by reason of insanity is entered, and many mitigating

24

factors directed toward the sentencing come in In an Indirect

25

fashion under the plea bf not guilty by reason of insanity.
8

1

Q

What about the state, can ifc put in evidence

z

on the issue of guilt and evidence that goes only to the

3

issue of punishment?

4

A

Mr. Justice Harlan, I believe that ifc would be

5

difficult fc© distinguish whether the state’s evidence is di­

6

rected to the issue of guilt or punishment because the aggra­

7

vating factors that would be necessarily involved in proving

8

the crime itself would also fee directed toward the punishment

9

phase of the matter.

10

Q

Mot necessarily.

You might have had 'a lot of

11

prior convictions that wouldn’t be admissible on the issue of

12

guilt but would be on the issue of punishment.

himself or subjects his character or reputation to inquiry.

15

Right.

17

A

Then, of course, the state can put on that

type of evidence.

.

Q

May 2 asSs you this question while you are

20

pausing here.

a defendant in any capital esse t© put the whole range of Ms

22

Ifc is pos­

sible for him to put it in.

Q

And he can put it in without being subjected

4

himself to cross-examination, put it in through the mouth of

5

an expert?

A

That's correct, but there is incriminating

evidence that comes in with this psychiatric testimony,

criminal incidents, they are appearing not only in the admis­

sions reports, in the psychologist's report and many times in

14

the evidence of his background through medical records oft-

15

times incriminating himself vicariously through what he has

16

said to the psychiatrist on an earlier occasion.

17

Q

You say this often happens, but it doesn’t

A

It doesn't necessarily, no, air,

Ifc would be

21

difficult, however, to try a case in front of a jury and

22

attempt fc© block part ©f the medical records from a technical

23

standpoint, to deprive the jury of some part of the medical

24

record when you are submitting the others for examination.

25

So there is a certain compulsion to submit to the jury the
10

1

entire medical record when there is this evidence in it.

2

When the defendant, Craxnpion, was confronted with

3

the dilemma in the present case, he elected to invoice his

4

Fifth Amendment rights and he thereby surrendered his right to

5

address the jury, who is in effect the sentencer in this case,

6

on the right of his punishment.

7

Now, the statute in Ohio with reference to allocution

8

is a mandatory statute so held by our Supreme Court, and we

9

go through the ritual in Ohio of bringing the defendant before

10

the court in a capital case after he has been found guilty

1?

without a recommendation of mercy by the jury, and asking him

12

if he has anything to say as to why sentence should not be

13

imposed upon him.
The court is not the sentencer in this case.

14

It is

15

merely imposing the verdict upon the basis of the mandatory

16

allocution statute he is asked this, but the statute is mean­

17

ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. CALLAHAN, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER — RESUMED

7
8
9

MR. CALLAHAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court.
The petitioner, Crampton, in this case, when he

10

was confronted at the outset of his trial with the dilemma as

11

to his rights, chose to exercise his Fifth Amendment right

12

and because he feared that If he

tried to address his

3

aenteneer, the jury in this case, he would subject himself to

4

the broad range of impeachment and inquiries and also subject

5

himself fco incriminating cross-examination.

16

This selection is coerced by the unitary trial

7

system in Ohio.

8

either the fight to avoid incriminating himself or the right

9

to allocution, because he feared the consequences that may

20
21

He is compelled tc select one of the rights,

come from selecting the other.
In this case, his choice was not a completely free

22

one, and this compulsion that was induced by the system that

23

prevails in Ohio; it has been suggested that this choice of

2«.

right Is no more than a dilemma that confronts any criminal

25

defendant as fco the matter of his trial tactics or trial
6

1

strategy.
But we would submit to this Court that in making

2
3

this selection, it is far more than a selection of trial

4

tactics or a choice of trial tactics.

S

tioner laid his life on the line in making the selection.

6

knows as he goes into the trial that the jury will be informed

7

and instructed on what to consider and what not to consider

8

on the issue of his guilt.

9

ment, he knows that they may condemn him to death for any

In this case the peti­

10

reason, for twelve different reasons or for no reason at all,

11

and —

12

Q

Wouldn't that be true in a regular trial?

13

A

It would be, Your Honor, that he would be

14

looking at the issue of punishment.

15

with respect to punishment in the State of Ohio.

16

merely told, as they were in the Grampian case, that they had

17

to decide after he was found guilty, if they found him guilty

18

of first degree murder, whether or not they should recommend

W

mercy.

2Q

Q

There is no instruction
The jury is

Mr, Callahan, as a practical matter, isn't it

21

true that the overwhelming majority of defendants have other

22

factors that inhibit them from taking the stand, whether there

23

is a death penalty involved or not?

24
25

&

I would agree with you, Your Honor, that there

are an unlimited number of other factors in addition to the
17

1

death penalty in these cases,, but the reason of paramount im­

2

portance --

3

Q

4

You mean this choice is that much more import­

ant in a capital case?

S

A

Because of the capital case, because ~~

6

Q

It is the only difference,, isn't

7

A

1 begyour pardon?

8

Q

It is the only realdifference,isn't it?

9

A

Yes.

Q

Every defendant in every criminal case is

it?

n

somewhat chilled or otherwise discouraged about talcing the

12

stand in most cases, isn't that true?
A

13

Etot all, sir -- yes, most.

But in a capital

14

case we submit there is a distinction because of the punish-

15

ment involved and because of the manner in which that punish­

16

ment is meted out in Ohio.

17

Q

But you are not suggesting that either this

18

defendant or defendants generally in capital cases would take

20

A

I believe,, Your Honor, that the choice that

21

the defendant makes in a capital case at the outset of the

22

ease, if he were aware that he could address his sentence

23

around the matter, he would be more inclined to take the

24

stand in the penalty phase of the trial, similar to

25

California, which we do not have in the Ohio ease, if I under18

That is just another way of saying that if you

That's right.

That is the reality of it, isn't it?
A

Ifc is true, but it is also a possibility that

10

in a bifurcated trial the penalty phase could work against

II

him permitting the states to introduce evidence of aggravation.

12

Now his character and reputation are at issue but they are not

13

at issue in the guilt phase unless he puts them at Issue.

14

I submit that the difference is that when he makes the elec­

15

tion, considering the point.

16

G

Well, but take this bifurcated situation where

the second trial is on penalty only, he is not compelled to

18

take the stand, is he?

19
20
21

A

So

Ho, sir, not under the present procedures of

which I am aware.
Q

And the states, in the cases where they have

22

the two-stage trial, may put in a very wide rang© of evidence

23

adverse to him, factors in aggravation, whether he takes the

24

stand or whether he doesn't?

25

A

l agree, and that is a possibility.
19

But it has

1

when you consider that that evidence cannot be introduced by

the state in the single ferial unless the defendant puts it

Q

Mr. Callahan* was there any request for a

There was no request made in this case, Your

bifurcated trials made by the defendants in Ohio.

A

1

The first instance that I know of in my study

2

of this case. Your Honor, is the case of Maxwell vs. Bishop,

S

which was before this Court in the 1968 Term, 1 believe.

4

G

Did you find any suggestion before that time?

S

A

Ho, sir, I did not.

©

This procedure in Ohio that forces the defendant

7

to make his selection between these two rights is, we claim,

8

similar to the procedure that was condemned by this Court in

9

the Simmons case, that a constitutional right should not have

‘10

to be surrendered in order to assert another constitutional

n

right.

!£

pels this type of surrender.

We submit that the Ohio single verdict procedure com­

13

The procedure also imposes --

14

G

15
16

In that statement, are you claiming the right

of allocution in the constitutional right?
A

X am, sir.

The right of allocution, the right

17

to offer evidence on the question of his punishment and the

18

right to have an opportunity to be heard by his sentencer, I

19

submit, is a fight guaranteed under the due process clause.

20

Q

Is any case, state or federal, so held?

21

A

The only cases that we refer to as supporting

22

this contention, Your Honor, is the eases of Specht vs.

23

Patterson and Mempa vs.

24
25

r

hay.

This Court has also considered the burdens that are
placed upon the assertions of a constitutional right in the
21

1

United States versus Jackson, and in Crampton we contend that

2

there is an inpermissible burden placed upon the defendant's

3

exercise of his Fifth Amendment right against self-

4

incrimination in violation of this Court's holding in the

S

Jackson case.

6

The procedure in Ohio has the quality of needlessly

7

encouraging a waiver of this Fifth Amendment right if he wishes

8

to talk to the jury, and it needlessly chills the right to

9

present evidence on the question of punishment relative to his

10

rational sentencing.

!1

Constitution has held that the defendant need not do anything

12

to defend himself against a charge brought against him, but it

13

has likewise observed that he certainly cannot be required to

14

help convict himself.

IS

quires that he help convict himself, and that the judgment

MR. CHI®1 JUSTICE BURGER:

19

Q

Thank you, Mr. Callahan.

Let me ask you one question.

As 1 understand

20

if, this record contains evidence bearing upon the defendant's

21

sanity or alleged insanity, does it not?

22

A

That is correct, Your Honor.

23

G

Is this not in itself mitigating to a degree,

24

25

in any event?
A

It is, to a certain extent.
22

However, in

1

introducing the medical records to support the plea of not

2

guilty by reason of insanity, the defendant had to take another

3

calculated risk as to his trial tactic, because in those

4

records was contained his prior criminal record, which he bad

5

told the admissions officer, the doctors and the psychiatrist

6

at the hospital,,

1

Q

That leads me to my next question.

Doesn't the

8

record contain already evidence as to his alleged addiction and

9

his prior convictions?

10

A

Yes, sir, it does.

11

Q

Well then, what prejudice was he concerned

!2
13

about in not taking the stand?
A

The prejudice of incriminating himself.

The

14

possibility of incriminating himself in this case in violation

IS

of his rights under the Fifth Amendment.

16

is that the jury having at one sitting to consider guilt or

17

innocence, sanity or insanity, and punishment, either death or

18

life, is a procedure that compels the defendant to make certain

19

choices which are needlessly made, -which he does not have to

2@

make, if there were a bifurcated trial, if there were judge

21

sentencing or review of the sentence by a judge in Ohio, or if

22

the death penalty were abolished.

23

Q

ARGUMENT'.CP MELVIN L, RESNICK, ESQ,

4

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

5

MR. RESNICK:

Mr. Chief «Justice, may it please the

6

Court,, the petitioner's basic position in regard to the ques­

1

tion of bifurcation of trials in capital cases consists of

8

three matters.

9

His first position is that there is a collision of

10

constitutional rights.

11

Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and his

12

alleged Fourteenth Amendment right to allocution are colliding

13

and that one imperial ssatoly burdens the exercise of his

14

privilege not to testify.

15

cases of U.S. vs. Jacteson, Simmons and cases where two specific

16

constitutional rights were involved.

17

claim that wehave a question of fundamental fairness under the

18

due process clause.

IS

that there is no collision of constitutional rights in that,

20

No. le allocution has never risen to a constitutional right?

2!

secondly^ that there is no burden or penalty on the exercise

22

of his right against self*incrimination because allocution

23

evidence can be admitted toy other witnesses.

24
25

In this particular case, he claims his

His reliance in that regard on the

Secondly, the petitioner had a choice to do what he
considered would benefit him the most when he made his decision

<J>

There was no compulsion; there was no

It was a pure voluntary choice.

It is also our position that the unitary trial is

4

fundamenta 1 ly fair,, and indeede better on the "fasts than in

S

the case of Spencer vs. Texas which Justice Blackman referred

6

fco.
Q

7

Mr. Resnick, on this allocution testimony, do

a

you tell us that in Ohio in the trial on chief you ean put

9

witnesses on Who know nothing about the crime at all, but just

10

that he's a nice fellow?

11

A

Could you do that?

In this specific case, Mr. Justice Marshall,

12

the mother of the defendant who knew nothing of the facts of

13

the actual crime testified as to the petitioner's entire life,

14

background, his trouble with the law, his marriages, whatever.

'

15
16

Q

Well, as a prosecutor, have you ever been

worried about mothers0 testiisohy hurting your case?

17

A

Pardon?

I am sorry?

18

Q

As a prosecutor, have you ever heard of a

19

defendants mother’s testimony hurting your case?

The defendant may put in his character In issue

other than through himself, yes„ under Ohio law.
Q

9

But until its in issue, its not — 1 just have

10

difficulty in seeing that he has all of the benefits of a

!1

sentencing hearing in his regular trial? that's my only point.

12

And there must be some difference in Ohio.
A

13

Well, the difference In Ohio, if the Court

14

please, Is that the defendant himself «■- and I think this is

15

what the petitioner is getting to, counsel for the petitioner

16

is getting to ~~ he cannot personally appeal to the jurors in

17

the case.

That is his main contention.

18

Q

Well, sir —

19

A

He is not contending that other witnesses may

20
21

not testify as concerns that.
Q

Certainly he cannot tell the jury, which he

22

could do at a sentencing hearing,. wO£ course 1 admit ray guilt

23

and 2 am sorry for it and 1 ask for mercy.”

24

not take that position, could he?

25

A

That Is correct.
28

Of course he could

So at least he loses that much, doesn't he?

2

A

That much we would go along with.

order to sustain your point.

A

That's all I was

the brush was

We submit, if it please the Court, that as

7

argued by counsel» the allocution statute in the State of Ohio,

8

as in most other states, is really only a legal objection and

9

it is so historically, and this Court has noted that distinc­

10

tion in the case of Schwab vs. Berggren, decided in 1892.

As

II

stated in the Government1s brief, it is usually something like

\Z

the pleading of a pardon or any other type of legal objection.

13

It actually has nothing to do with the sentencing discretion

14

regarding the defendant's opportunity to give mitigating evi­
dence.
The only place where 1 could imagine that this plea

1©

17

of allocution under the Ohio statute would apply would be

18

where the defendant could claim that there is an insufficiency

19

of the evidence'upon which the verdict was based.

20

the normal things that would be brought up on a motion for new

21

trial.

22

These are

In regard further to allocution, the Court in

ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. CALLAHAN, ESQ.,

9

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER -- REBUTTAL

10

MR. CALLAHAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

n

I will not repeat what has been said generally with

12

respect to standards.

13

as it has been suggested in a couple of briefs filed in this

14

case, could foe- considered to have a standard.

IS

I would submit to the Court that Ohio*

Cited on page 20 of the petitioner's brief is the

16

case of Howel 3 vs. State, in which the Ohio Supreme Court

17

held that it was error ~~ not error to charge the jury in a

18

capital case "to consider and determine whether or not in

19

view of all the circumstances and facts leading up to and

20

attending the alleged hosaicide as disclosed by the evidence,

21

you should or should not make such recommendation of mercy."

22

Now, I would submit that that is merely an instruc­

23

tion to the jury that they should consider all of the evidence

24

in a case, and it may be a standard, but it is not an adequate

25

standard and it was not given in the Crampton case.

The only instruction that was given to the jury»

that is other than to seat a jury» twelve people» appears at

But the

dice.

11

I submit that when you tell the jury that one of the

12

things they must not consider is sympathy» you have effectively

13

stopped any argument toy the defendant for mercy in the case.

14

The distinguished Solicitor General has indicated

15

that the single verdict trial,, the bifurcated trial» would be

16

available also to a defendant in cases of self-defense defenses

17

or in cases of alibi defenses.

te

The distinction that I "would point out with refer­

19

ence to those two observations is that both of these matters,

20

self defense and alibi, relate to the question of the defend­

21

ant "s guilt.

22

Q

23

They do not go t© the question of his punishment.
Does not the criminal responsibility also go

to the question of guilty in a legal sense?

24

I\

That is correct» Your Honor.

25

Q

But California, at least» bifurcates that
45

1

trials do they not?

2

A

That is correct.

3

Q

So it wouldn't be very remarkable if someone

4

would built on the analogy of bifurcated trials for the in­

5

sanity question to bifurcated trial for alibi or self-defense

8

trial?
A

7

I submit that it could toe argued that way* Your

8

Honor, but it is not part of the submission in this case* that

9

we require — that they require a bifurcated trial under self-

10

defense and alibi.

11
12

Q

But wouldn't you agree that the arguments might

be just as valid?

13

A

Take the self-defense case.

I don't think they could be just as valid as

14

the insanity argument.

15

16

defendant.

Q

The insanity plea has been -- is a

Well* each of them,, in the nature at least* in

18

the broad sense* in the nature of a plea of confession and

19

20

A

That is correct.

21

Q

So that in that sense they have a common

22
23

genesis and a common thread of logic?
A

That is correct.

But to say that they -- they

m

do not* however, self-defense or insanity or alibi relate

2%>

directly to the question of punishment, and what we are
46

1

contending in this case is that the bifurcated trial that per­

2

mits the defendant, after he has been found guilty and

3

responsible, to address the sentencer on the question of his

4

punishment

5

The trilogy of guilty plea decisions made by this

6

Court last terra, I believe, can be effectively distinguished

7

from the Crarapton case as the Crampton case

0

out, whereas the cases decided by the Court in the last term,

in Craxnpfcon, he

10

the Brady, McMann and Parker cases, involved originally a

11

guilty plea, a concession by the defendant that he was guilty

S2

of the crime.

13

1 submit to the Court that for the reasons that we

14

have argued, the decision of the Ohio courts should be re­

15

versed and the cause remanded for determination with respect

16

to punishment.

17

Q

Your colleague in the other case, Mr. Selvin,

18

suggested that as far as he could see there was no constitu­

1©

tional barrier to having a legislature vest in the judge the

20

power to fix the sentence, without standards, or to fix a

21

mandatory sentence.

22
23
24
2§

A.

Do you have a view on that?

Yes, I ss&e no constitutional barrier for

having the legislature filing standards for the judge..
Q

Well, no,, ray question is just the reverse,

vesting the power of imposing the death sentence in the judge.

utility of these studies which are done because of the diffi­

14

Professor Calvin and his associates at the University of

15

ChicagOj their conclusion was that judges having the power to

16

impose the death sentence imposed it exactly twice as often

17

over a great number of eases as juries did..

18

&

19

Q

That would not certainly leave defendants as

20

a group to want to move this out of juries and put it in

22

A

No, sir,, not that conclusion.

23

With reference to the problem ©f standards, there

24

appears in the petitioner's brief at page 21 probably the best

25

evidence with respect to the necessity for standards, where a
48

1

foreman of a jury comes before the court and asks the court

2

what criteria,,, what are the grounds for granting mercy in the

3

case, and there is a colloquy there between the judge and the

4

foreman of the jury that betrays the jury's curiosity as to

5

the standards necessary for the granting of mercy,

6

the point where they want to consider the sociological and

environmental factors in it.
