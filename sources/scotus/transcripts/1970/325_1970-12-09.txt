MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argumfcfcfes

next in Number 325s Negre against Larson.
ORAL ARGUMENT BY RICHARD HARRINGTON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

5
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may proceed whenever

6
you are ready, Mr. Harrington.
7

MR. HARRINGTON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may

it

8
please 'the Court:

This is a petition for certiorari to the

9

9th Circuit Court of Appeals by Louis Negre.
1©
Louis Negre is a young man who is a Catholic con™
ii
scientious objector.

He got discharged from the United States

12

Armed Forces when he was assigned to serve in Vietnam.

And

13

his application for conscientious objection discharge having
14

been denied by the Army on the grounds that it was based on a
15

personal moral code.

He was assigned to go to Vietnam.

16

So, in this case’,"there is no question that the war
17

in which he was asked to serve was the war to which he objects.
18

He had standing to object to serving in that particular war to
19

which he was assigned.

He sought a writ of habeus corpus,

20
before Judge Zirpoli in San Francisco, to restrain the Amy
21
from shipping him to Vietnam to take part in that war and to be
22
discharged as a religious objector.
23

Judge Zirpoli denied his application for habeus
24

corpus on grounds set out in his opinion and in the course of
25

2

1

argmuent.? he made the observation ' that even if my client,

z

Louis Negre, were willing to serve in the United States, that

3

under the common law concept he would be aiding and abetting

4

the war.
My client relied, however, on the concept that was

5
6

traditional in the law and also in logic between proximate and

7

remote participation.

8

distinction, that he would not participate in any form in the

9

weir

><.

He indicated that he drew a practical

but liKe the man in Kansas, who was against World War II

10

and he was a railroad switchman»

11

the switches when the railroad troop trains came through»

12

now it is charged against him that he isn't willing to par­

13

ticipate in war.

14

He did not decline to flip
And

a

And of course it would be nonsense to say that a mac.

15

has to close his eyes when a troop train goes by or else he is

16

participating in war.

17

participation and participarion and my client refused to par-

IS

ticipate and refused to participate in Vietnam.

19
20
21

Q

There is a distinction between the non­

How long had he been '• in the service at the

time he made his first claim?
A

He made his first claim, Your Honor, approxi­

22

mately four months after induction into the service and after

23

he had been assigned to serve in Vietnam.

24
25

Q

Does he daim that this belief had come to

fruition in that four-month period, or was it the assignment to
3

Vietnam that merely triggered a preexisting belief?
2

A

I think the latter. Your Honor? he was a

3

Roman Catholic and as I have been at pains to set out in my

4

brief, and this is set out by the Army hearing officer -•»

5

Q

WE11, then my questions werepreliminary then

0

to asking if that’s -the case why wouldn’t just a cancellation

7

of his assignment to Vietnam satisfy his objections?

a
9
to

A

If that were the case, the Array’s answer to

that in Judge Zirpoli*s court was that they had no provision
for cancelling his assignment to Vietnam»

11

On the pragmatic side the Army puts the practical!”

12

ties substantially as the Solicitor General does, and says "We

13

don’t have any form of duty where a man can say sI6il serve

14

here, but I won * t serve there. e t!

15
16

17

Q

Then his_posi.tion was taken only because of the

Army limitations and not for any other reasons?
A

His position was taken only because the Army

Vs"

said it had-no assignments for'him except to compel him to

19

participate in the War in Vietnam»

20

they carried him. They assigned four sergeants, put'him on an

21

airplane and carried him to Vietnam* after this Court refused

22

to entertain a stay.

23
24
25

Q

And that’s where, indeed,

He is now back in this country and remains in

the Army Reserves?
A

He has a four-year Army Reserve obligation and

4

1

I presume the next time# Your Honors# that they want him to

2

serve# they will pick him up again and take him again. as they

3

have done on prior occasions.

4

Q

Wall# as I read your brief# he was ordered to

5

Vietnam; he refused®

'6

to obey a lawful order and he .was acquitted.
A

7
8

He was then court-martialed for refusal
Is- that correct?

He was acquitted because the Army didn't

follow its own procedures in processing

his application.

9

Q

What do you mean?

10

A

Well# he filed th& first application xtfhieh was

11

summary because hastily prepared.

That was denied.

He filed

12

a second application supported with a citation of religious

13

authority and letters from friends.

14

just same#6" but the Army could not persuade the court martial

15

it was same.

16

said that's entirely different; please process the second

17

application.

The Army said# "That's

The seven combat --reterans in the court martial

The second application was then denied; he then

13

19

declined to go to Vietnam.

I suggested they court martial him;

20

he was ready to stand court martial# but they carried him off

21

instead.

How long did he stay

Is there any

dispute that the Catholic

doctrine as a doctrine, of Catholism, recognizes selective

There is — the Solicitor General takes the

view that that puts him in the realm of politics.

Well, he hash81 addressed himself to it, but

I can answer that as follows;

S

Aquinas in his treatise. Part II, Section 2,

6

Question 40, put that very question, and he said — the

7

question is; "Is it always sinful to participate in war?"

8

answer was "no."

Canon 1366, of Canon Law in the Roman Catholic Church, is

The

That was 1272, Teachings of Aquinas, by

10

binding teaching in all Catholics.

11

reaffirmed, however, by Aquinas, but I discounted him in the

brief by St. Augustine, by Victoria Salamanaca, 1520? St.

Q

And that doctrine was

Well, I didn't sxippose, at least as I read

16

the briefs, that there was any dispute about that.

point is; this is not a Seeger type or a WElsh-type conscien­

I think Your Honor is absolutely correct.

Yes, it does? Your Honor,

11

A

No? Your Honor,

It says the factors — by

12

starting from Aquinas, as I say in 1272, they are often broken

13

down into lists; whether the war was declared by the properly

14

constituted government, is one factor; whether it's conducted

in defense as opposed to a war of aggression, is another fac­

the civilian populations who are not combatants is the third

factor.

Accordingly, there are factors which have different

20

numbers on different lists, but they go to the justice of the

21

war in the broad sense.

harm done exceeds the gain that may be expected from the war.

Now, one of the tests is whether the

Well, 1 think the function as outlined cor­

rectly in the Seeger opinion, that what the government draft
board or hearing officer has to do is to determine, are the
beliefs religious? and are they, second, sincerely held?

Once

they are found to be religious and sincerely held it’s no part
of government to put on a theological hat and say, "Well, my
wfriend, you say it's religious and you have support of the
others that it is religious, but we have the government theo­
logian sitting here and he wants to engage in a theological
imposition — to say you a.re an orthodox Catholic:

than it was in the last case»
A

Well, Your Honor —

Q

Am I mistaken?

23
A

I think the Solicitor General contends that my

24
client's objection is illegal.

The brief says that despite the

25
10

1

fact that he's resting it on the teaching of the Roman

2

Catholic Church x»/hich has been uniform for 2,000 years and

3

despite the fact that the only hearing officer in his findings,

4

set out in the Appendix A-37, said the following;

5

training has been extensive and he is extremely devout.

6

sincerity is shown by his willingness to be incarcerated for

7

his beliefs.

'’His religious
His

The roots of his beliefs are religious.

The real question in this case is what are those

8
9

beliefs?

It is not — beliefs are not based on religious

10

grounds.

He continues — Appellant sincerely believes that

11

the War in Vietnam is wrong and his failure to object to serving

iZ

in Vietnam is in violation of his religious beliefs.

13

Q

Well, I say, I don’t think there is an issue

14

about that in this case.

15

A

Am I mistaken?

Why is the

16

Solicitor General asserting that his objection is political

when it was found by the fact-finder in the case to-be religious ?■

I didn't under sfcan&cthat the Solicitor General was making any

such contention.

in his religion as objectionable in some fashion, is of neces­

Congressman Faddis in 1940, the time of great

national peril, outlined what the real pragmatic problem here
is, which is quite different from the speculative problem.

He

said, "If I were to go out and command the troops, and I may;
I don't want any conscientious objectors in ray regiment at all.

Who would want a man out in the perimeter and one thing you

know about him is he won't use his weapon?
Q

10

That's what I come back to.

And he did cite that he was willing,to

serve in a capacity that was not participation in the war.
Q

Is it in the record that he is in the Ready

Reserve now or as distinguished from whether he is attending or
not attending the meetings?
A

No, ites not, Your Honor.

The Solicitor

General, in a footnote, concedes that the case is not moot?
that under Carafas v. LaVallee he has this obligation which is
a substantial burden on him and I think that's clear from his
four-year reserve obligation fixed by 10USC 270.

And he can be

called into active duty at any time, in the Ready Reserve.
Q

But why is his posture any different now,

Welly Your Honor, in the — doctrine he had

not been, called upon to form his conscience about participation

And, having made the judgment he then was bound by

Accordingly, that’s what he

'13

did do? he did refuse, but he was, as 1 say, carried off,

14

nevertheless.
How, I assert, Your Honor, our position is quite

IS
16

simple? it’s an equal protection position that if the Quaker

17

ORAL ARGUMENT BY ERWIN R, GRISWOLD, SOLICITOR

5

GENERAL, ON BEHALF OB’ THE UNITED STATES

6

MR. GRISWOLD:

May it please the Court:

before

7

opening my argument in this case, I would like to clarify two

8

things which came up in the previous argument and which are

S

relevant here.

10

Mr. Justice Harlan referred to a, the fact that

11

there is in the statute a reference to a purely personal moral

Ia

code.

13

chance to find the statutory language.

14

to the Petitioner’s brief in this cases the Negre case on page

15

1—A at the back.

IS

construed to require any person to be subject to Combatant

17

training and service in the Armed Forces of the United States

18

who, by reason of religious training and belief is conscien­

19

tiously opposed to participating in war in any form."

I was a little vague in my answer.

I have now had a

It is in the appendix

’’Nothing contained in this title shall be

And then comes this sentence which was unfortunately

20

omitted in the printing of our briefs

21

"As usad in this subsection the- term 'religious

22
23

training and belief0 does not include essentially political,

24

sociological or philosophical views or a merely personal moral

25

code."

!

It was because of the way the statute has put it as a
26

1

definition of religions training and belief which we are not

2

questioning here, rather than as having something to do with

3

participation in war in any form that I omitted it before»

4

Formally, verbally that is the way that it is limited»

5

tically, it seems to me to give some indication of what

6

Congress is trying to get at in formulating the provision

7

itself»
And -then thersa was a question to me as to whether

8
9

Prac­

Congress had ever refused to allow conscientious objection»

10

This is covered on pages 34 to 36 of the supplement to the

11

brief which we filed in 'the Welsh case, which we printed the

12

brief in the Seeger case which gave a detailed treatment of the

13

history»
The fact is that at the beginning of the Civil War

14
15

military service was a state matter.

16

was always -the "Jth of Massachusetts," and the "3rd of Ohio,"

17

and so on.

18

conscientious objector provisions and others had different

19

ones — and thereafter Congress provided for a draft, but at

20

the beginning it provided that you could provide substitutes

21

and a great many of the

22

provided a substitute»

23

And you will remember it

Thereafter Congress said — and some states had

conscientious objectors apparently

Finally, thereafter, during the Civil War, Congress

24

enacted the statute which was typical of the form right down

25

through the World War II, that "Members of religious
27

1

denominations who shall by oath or affirmation, declare that

2

they are conscientiously opposed to the bearing of arms and who

3

are prohibited frcaa doing so by the rules and articles of faith

4

and practice of said religious denomination? shall? when

5

drafted into the military service? be considered noncombatant

6

and shall be assigned by the Secretary of War to duty in the

7

hospitals or to the care of Freedmen or shall pay the sura of

8

$200 to such person as the Secretary of War shall designate to

9

receive it to be applied to the benefits of -the sick and wounded

soldiers.
"Provided no person shall be entitled to the bene-

12

13

of ■ conscientious scruples against bearing arras shall be sup­

14

ported by satisfactory evidence that his deportment has been

15

17

in some, ways? more complicated? it presents essentially ‘the

Is it your contention? Mr, Solicitor General?

20

at all, that in this case that sentence that you read to us

21

about "essentially political? sociological? or philosophical

22

views, or merely personal moral code?" is it any part of your

23

But it is, insofar

8

as I understand it, it is the doctrine of the Catholic Church

has theological significance.
However, the church, as I understand

it, does not

good Quakers who have served in wars : Paul Douglas served

actively in World War II; Herbert Hoover was Commander-In-Chief

says,

"Based on my religious beliefs I object to the Vietnam

You apparently concede that both beliefs motivating

the refusal are religious beliefs? that the one you would say

8

Q

I think we are

Would it be correct to say — that another way

9

to put your position, .Mr. Solicitor General, is that when it's

10

a selective choice, subjective on the basis of what wars then

11

the reason for it becomes irrelevant.

12

A

Yes, Mr. Justice? 1 think that’s what I We

13

been trying to says whether it is religious or not, if it is

14

selective that fa) it does not come within the statute, and (b)

15

there is nothing in the constitution which requires Congress

16

to recognise it, or putting it another way; it does not amount

17

to an establishment of religion or a denial of the free exer­

18

cise of a relgion which is allthat the First Amendment covers ?

13

nor is it an invidious discrimination insofar as there, is an

20
21

- - -*4»

equal protection concept in the Fifth Amendment.
Now, it’s already been pointed out that this case is

22

different from the. Gillette case, since it arises in habeus

23

corpus and is not a criminal case.

24

any significant difference? it is based on a directive of the

25

Department of Defense and Army regulations which provide for
33

This, I don’t think, makes

!

release of people on the basis of conscientious objection and

2

they should bs judged according to the regulations, by the same

3

standards, whether made before or after entering military ser­

4

vice and these shall be the selective service system standards.

5

Thus, Section SJ is incorporated into the relevant

©

military regulations.

7

again, as has been asserted, as has been stated here by Mr.

8

Harrington, that the Petitioner is no longer on active duty in

9

the Army.

I

do think it is pertinent to point out

He has been transferred to the Ready Reserve.

He

10

sen .quite readily within the conscientious scruples which he

11

showed during the four months that he was in the Army where he

12

was willing to serve in uniform on this side, he can quite

!3

readily comply with the military requirement which, it seems to

14

me if h® doesn't, it would be completely a clear case of

15

military disobedience which ought to be treated as such.

1©
17

If he does feel that his views have now changed so
that he is opposed to participation in war in any form, he is

18

still entitled to file a claim based upon that.

19

understand that he has ever made any such claim.

I do not

20

Now, the other difference between this case-and the

21

Gillette case as already pointed out, is that the objection in

7

would be prepared to perform noncombatant hospital service in

8

the United States because such service is not directly in aid

to the Amy in Vietnam.

10

On this basis he concludes that he cannot

The hearing officer found that he was a devout

11

Catholic who sincerely believed that the War in Vietnam was

12

wrong and he concluded, however, that the application for dis™

13

charge should be rejected because, in his opinion, the appli­

14

cant objected to a particular war and not to war in any form,

15

and this was supported by the Department of the Army.

22

General,

No one would know batter than the Solicitor General,

23

even the Members of the Court, the difficulty of these cases.

24

I do not understand why, if this man has gotten what he wants,

25

and is not being compelled to fight, this wouldn’t be moot?

36

A

1

Well, Mr» Justice* I share that feeling to a

2

very considerable extent»

3

There is a suggestion ...here by Mr. Harrington* not supported in

4

the record*-- I mean I'm not denying it -- I just donst know*

5

that he isn*t attending his drills* and may be subject to an

6

order of call-up.

of total conscientious objection.

This man is in the Ready Reserve.

As I have said* that seems to

me to be a

He has never made a claim
This has never been passed

His claim is one of selective conscientious

10

objection and it seems to me that the effect of the Department

11

of the Army was that he would be classified as 1-A-G; that is*

12

as a noncombatant in the military services which was the ser­

13

vice which he did perform.
Frankly* I don’t myself* understand why the case

14
15

isn't moot* that I suppose that —

16

Q

If you lose this case —

17

A

The case is citedin thefootnotes as having

18

a chilling effect on me -and I didn't quite feel that I could

19

assert that the case was moot.

20

if I had moved to dismiss the case on the grounds that it was

21

moot* I would have thought that maybe I would have not been

22

successful.

It seams to me that this is

Because he is ~

X don’t see why we —

Mr, Justice, he is trying vary hard to opt a

15

called back iato active service in order that he may get another

16

order to go to Vietnam, the order that he may be sure .that the

issue will be presented«__
Whether that possibility which turns considerably on

18
19

his own determination to get a decision on this issue, is

20

sufficient to keep the case from being moot, is something which

21

the Court ought to consider; will consider, of course.

seems to me there is much reason to think that this is a case

which is essentially moot,

If it is ■ relevant* it seems to me it ought to be

put in by evidence? it ought to be subject to examination and

13

cross-examination and ithere ought to have been an opportunity

14

to putin other teachings of other prominent Catholic theolo­

15

gians and I have no' doubt that a very confusing mass of

16

material altogether can be found rather than the selected

17

materials which are here. But * the point which I want to make is — can be

18

19

seen in two places in this briefs . page 3* the heading *

He would always say, well I will

participate in just wars and I would call yornr attcfttiw to the

3

fact that the Mulloy case which was decided by this Court last

3

record about Catholic doctrine and he claimed to be a total

6

conscientious objector»

We have filed a petition for certiorari in an&fcher

8

ease which is now pending, raising an issue like this?

laird

9

against Caprobianco(ph) Wo. 611, which also involves this

10

Catholic who claims to be a total conscientious objector and I

1!

think that the light comes on page 7 of the reply brief.

12

This is theplace where there was an error in the

13

printing of the brief and the material —

14

and X hope in yours

IS

is the language just below the middle of page 7:

IS

my copy

at least,

has been written in in longhand.

This

"Captain Van Wert, was correct in capturing the

17

theological gist of the teaching of Paul VI in the Pastoral

18

Constitution that a Catholic has a religious duty to distin­

19

guish between just wars in which he may participate and unjust

20

wars in which he has a religious duty to refuse to participate.

21

Q

The brief I have does not read that way.

reads: "to discriminate between just wars in which he has a

make up their minds or whether ™-

Mr. Solicitor General, there is a very

13

(Laughter)

19

A

Well, I’m sorry, Mr. Justice.

The copy that

20

was furnished me has the language on which I have based my

21

argument and which I will stand on, "to distinguish between

22

just wars in which he may participate and unjust wars in which
he has a religious duty to refuse to participate —

23
24
25

i

Q

Where are the alternative briefs?

A*.

And I wi 11. venture the suggestion that the

!

sound theological doctrine is that a Catholic may participate

2

in all wars? that a Catholic may decline to participate in all

3

wars, and that he is not within a religious duty to participate

4

in just wars? that he does have a considerable freedom of

5

conscience and I haven't the slightest doubt that that is the

6

practical construction which has been given, not only by many

7

individual Catholics but by their religious advisors.

Q

Mr. Solicitor General, in the other case, in

■the Gillette case, there was no finding in either of the courts

10

below as to whether or not a religious belief was involved.

11

B ut you don't challenge it, but if that were determined that

12

there wasn't a religious belief involved, why, we wouldn't be

13

reaching, same ©f these questions in that case, either.
A

14

Well, that depends an what the decision in the

15

Welsh case means and all! can say is that five members of the

16

Court, on one ground or another, have determined that the words

17

"religious training and belief" in the statute do not have

18

much significance.

19

have.

21

Four, because they don't think it should

And, all that we on this side of the bar can do is
to undertake t© proceed on the basis ©f the decision which we

23

have reached for varying reasons by five members ©f the Court

24

which did, in effect, write out from the statute, the words

25

"religious training and belief.”

FURTHER ARGUMENT BY RICHARD HARRINGTON, ESQ,

'3

Mr» Harrington, we will

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. HARRINGTON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

7

please the Courts

The Clerk did a marvelous job printing my

S

brief on very short notice.

9

the errata sheet filed yesterday with the Clerk is before the

The printed text is set out in

10

Court, and the proper correction appears at page 7 after

11

line 23: "Discriminates between just wars in which he has a

12

religious duty to participate and unjust wars in which he has

13

s\n unjust duty to refuse to participate.'5

14
15
16

Now, my too minutes remaining I will make two
points? which will be a record for brevity, I hope.

First,

First, the Solicitor General, I think, never

17

answered Mr. Justice White's inquiry how the constitution

18

permits discrimination between religions on the grounds of

1©

belief in this case.

20

21

Q

We will have to start with the preraise that it

is discrimination.

22

A

I think Ms premise is that —

23

Q

If you go from that premise you don't have

24
25

any difficulty with the conclusion.
A

If Your Honor please, that's correct.' And if

44

1

you accept the religious beliefs of Negre here to be that he

2

must fight in just wars? he must refuse to fight in

3

wars

4

belief«

unjust

then that is a discrimination on -that basis and that

Q

5

Is there; anything to prevent a Presbyterian

6

or a Methodist or a Baptiste or anyone else from applying the

7

Pope's doctrine„ not the doctrine, but the historic doctrine

a

of 'the church —

3

A

MoYour Honor and I think that's exactly the

10

point Jus tic® Marshall /•;

11

religion.

12

orthodox believer or unorthodox.

9

that it's the individual's

It's not the place of government to say you asre an

And so if a Baptist would come with the belief,

13
14

based on his religion that like the Catholic, he must fight in

15

just wars and must refuse to fight the unjust wars and he can

16

get equal protection too,.- In that case -Q

17

m

Which church was that?

You were speaking

about another church then? what was that?

19

A

Justice Marshall's question about —

20

Q

What about the Baptist church?

21

A

Welly if the Baptist church had such a

22

teaching

23

Q

I thought you said it? that's all.

24

A

Your Honor» I think that any religion — what

25

I don't —

I'm really saying ~ 15ra not speaking as a theologian, but what
45

1

I think our constitution does is to permit each of us to have

2

some religious beliefs,

3

Q

Why wouidn8i that permit ~ why wouldn’t that

4

absolutely prevent the government

5

it shouldn’t be prevented or should ~ why wouldn’t that

6

absolutely make it impossible for the government to have a law

7

drafting an army?

8

A '

and Ism not saying whether

Because most, of the persons of the country

9

think that any wax* that the government starts is a just, war

10

and they go willingly and happily and are pleased to serve.

11
12

13

Q

Well, some of them keep that, opinion until

they are drafted»
A

Some after they are drafted lose some

14

enthusiasm, but they are nevertheless loyal soldiers ? and the

15

number of objectors is small.

IS

students with only 25,000 objectors.

There are 2 .million college

17

Q

18

many of them there are?

19

A

No, Your Honor, because ~~

20

Q

Suppose 98 percent of the people decided

21

22

Does your case depend ill any degree on how

to do that; you wouldn't —
A

-r

I agree entirely, and if 98,percent o:f: the

23

people adopted a religion and followed it the country would be

24

much better.

25

But in the field of the armed services, if they all
46

became pacifists we

wouldn't have any array»

Q

Or the war»

A

Or a war.

And I devoutly would, hope that the

world v?ould come to that condition»
Mr, Justice Black, I think the case is not moot.
It's not moot —
Q
A

Why?
It's not moot, Your Honor, for three different

i

reasonss Number one, if the application had been granted when ishould, my client would have been discharged and would have
• i

had no reserve obligation whatever.
Number two; there is —

I don't see why not,

Q

I thought they just

objected to getting mixed up in this war,
A

Well, Your Honor, departing from the record,

on the grounds of mootness, I should lay the full record before
the Court.

The fact of the matter is before this young man

went to Vietnam he amended his application’, solely in this par­
ticular,

He said, "After that's happened to me I'm unwilling

to serve in the United States Army anywhere because it new all
appears to me to constitute aiding and abetting this immoral
war, which violates my religion.
How, the Solicitor General never that this
Q

That must have been a newly-developed idea,

from what you say.

47

!

A

It was»

Judge Zirpoli pointed out to him at

2

trial that .he was aiding and abetting the war by releasing

3

another man to go and after he got 'that admonition from Judge

4

3irpoli and after this Court had denied certiorari, he -then

5

gave that consideration and he did amend his application in

6

that particular alone.

7

Now, therefore, the case is not moot.

The young

8

man feels that he should not participate in this war, even by

9

aiding and abetting it.

10
11

And, thirdly, as. I point out to you, Your Honors?
we did seek a stand before he went to Vietnam»

12

Q

Has he filled out a writ of habeas corpus to

14

A

Yes he has.

15

Q

On the ground that they might sometime sand

53

16

get out?

him to Vietnam?
4

17

Q

IS

.21

Before he went

filled out ithafc writ and—-

18

20

That8s this case, You;* Honor.

But it was not a new writ since he went into

the reserves?
'

A

No? no, he didn’t serve a new writ, Your Honor,

22

But I simply say that if an issue is the law, then he ean9t

23

raise it before he’s in the Array.

24

stay the -- in the Army, And when we gat to this Court we have

25

exhausted our remedies? we are too late.

And this Court will not
