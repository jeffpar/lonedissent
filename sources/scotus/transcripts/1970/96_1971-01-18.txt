ORAL ARGUMENT BY GEORGE M. SCOTT, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

7
8

MR. SCOTT:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court: ' - , ■

9

I must apologise for my voice.

I have had

10

laryngitis the last few days and I hope the Court will indulge

11

me in this.

13

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

That's quite all right,

counsel.
MR. SCOTT:

14

This case is unique, I think, in the

15

annals of jurisprudence.

16

before been presented to this Court.

17

protection of the laws and the 14th Amendment mean majority

18

rule in special elections which determine questions of public

19

policy.

20

The question presented has never
The question

'

does equal

To put it another way: does the 60 percent require­

21

ment, an extraordinary majority requirement of the constitu­

22

tion, and enabling (?) statutes in the State of West Virginia,

23

violate the 14th Amendment of the Federal Constitution?

24
25

The facts of the case are not in dispute; they are
simple and they are brief.

In my home county, Roane County in
2

1

West Virginia,, in April 1968 the Board of Education submitted

2

to the people for decision, two issues.

3

was whether or not to issue $1.8 million in general obligation

4

bonds.

5

The first

question

The second issue is whether or not to increase

6

the rate of taxation for current expenditures beyond the

7

constitutionally prescribed maximum for a period of five years

8
9

On each of these issues, approximately 51 and a
half percent of the persons voting, voted in the affirmative

10

and, of course, the issues failed of passage at the canvass

i!

by the board of education because the requisite 60 percent

12

of the voters did not approve the issues.

13

■ The Constitution of the State of West Virginia was

14

adopted in 1872 and at that time the 60 percent requirement so

15

far as bond indebtedness or any indebtedness extending beyond

16

the current fiscal year, was a part of the constitution.

17

In 1932 the tax limitation amendment was adopted

18

which set forth maximum tax rates for each political sub­

19

division and this limitation provided that these rates could

20

not be exceeded, except by vote of the people and 60 percent

21

voting in the affirmative.

22

In 1966 an amendment was presented to the people

23

of West Virginia, and the only question in that amendment was

24

ivhether or not to amend and cancel the 60 percent requirement

25

and substitute a simple majority requirement.
3

And the people

1

voted by a majority to retain this 60 percent rule.

2

Despite this background and in light of this

3

background, the Supreme Court of /appeals of the State of

4

West Virginia, decided at the instance of five citizens of

5

our comity who allegedly voted in the affirmative on- each of

<3

these issues, that the 60 percent requirement, the extra7

ordinary majority requirement was inherently discriminatory

8

in that it deleted or debased the vote of the persons who voted

9
10

11

12

“yes,"as compared to the vote of the persons who voted "no.”
Q

Can the constitution of West Virginia be

changed by a simple majority vote?
A

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, when it is submitted,

13

if it is submitted at the instance of a two-thirds vote in

14

each house of the legislature.

15

has a majority vote when submitted to the electorate at large.

IS

19

Q

On the vote of the people it

Does this record by any chance show what the

vote, in fact, was?
A

X9m not sure, Your Honor.

I think that ;the

dissent of Judge Haymond does show that.

20

Q

That is back in 1962, you mean?

21

A

1966.

22

Q

1966, when idle amendment was submitted?

23

A

Yes.

24

Q

And this involved both a bond issue and a

25

tax levy; is that it?
4

i

A

Yes, ;Mr. Justice.

2

Q

Each requiring 60 percent of the vote of

3

those voting?

4

A

That’s right.

5

Q

Does each of these provisions date back to

A

The tax limitation amendment dates back to

6

1932?

7

8

1932; that’s the levy.

Q

Tax levy?

A

Limited —

11

Q

The tax remedy in excess of what the local

12

government can do by itself?

13

A

That’s right, Mr. Justice.

In 1932 —

14

Q

And how about the bonding authority?

15

A

Our political subdivisions have always been

16

prohibited from borrowing money except by approval of two-

17

thirds of thepersons voting on the question of borrowing

18

money.

19

20

Ever since the existence of West Virginia as

That’s my understanding; at least from the

a state?

21

22

Q

1872 constitution, our constitution was —
Q

23

So far as the bonding authority goes, it goes

24

back to the original constitution of the State of West

23

Virginia?
5

1

A

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart»

z

Q

Now, we think that this — of course this

3

case doesn't present a situation where there was a discrimina"

4

tion based upon race or religion or wealth or place of

5

residence or the matter of status of any circumstance that

S

prevailed in any of the so-called "one-man, one-vote" cases»

7

Chere is, I think, no factual analogy betx^een those cases and

8

this case and yet our court" felt, obliged, by virtue of the

9

language in the opinions of those cases, to hold that this

10

60’ percent requirement was inherently discriminatory? and we

11

think ■— it is our submission that this is a monstrous mis­

tz

application of the "©n@-raan, one-vote" rule and to support

13

this submission I have cited to the Court in my brief?

14

articles which have appeared in the Virginia Law Review and

15

the Georgetown Law Review.

16

j

I have also stated articles which have appeared in

17

the Harvard haw Review, the Columbia Law Review, Houston Law

18

Review, Vanderbilt haw Review, and the West Virginia Law

19

Review and there are others, and the commentators are severely

20

critical of this decision, 1 think without exception»

2!

22
23

Q

The mathematical reasoning of the court is

certainly impeccable? isn't it?
A

Well, it’s certainly beyond dispute, Mr.

24

JusfciceHarlan, that 60 does not equal 40, and this is, I think,

25

the basic error the court fell into.
6

They treated this as a

i

problem of arithmetic rather than a problem of definition or

2

one of philosophy»

3

conclusions, the fact that 60 is to 40 as one-and-one-half is

4

to one, that the rules of arithmetic, I think, must lead to

5

an absurd result? because if you say, speaking mathematically,

6

that this provision is inherently discriminatory then mathe­

7

matically speaking you would have to say that a majority rule

a

is likewise discriminatory.

9

as more is to less and inherently unequal.

10
11
12

IS

14

I think unless they reach this profound

And a majority is, to my idea,

But, it is a mathematical, I think, that: can’t be
used.
Q

Yet one can’t escape the fact that arithmetic

underlies the one-man, one-vote rule? doesn’t it?
A

Only on the basis of comparison, I think, in

15

the geographical sense, and also a different context of whether

16

so many more people have the right to elect only one delegate,

17

whereas, as opposed to fewer people in another area.

18

mathematics does have a part in it, but not in the sense that

19

I would present here? that is the sense of equality.

20

doesn't have to — one doesn't have to equal one before it can

21

be constitutional equality, it seems to me.

22
23

Q

So,

It

What did the court do with the Federal Con­

stitutional amending process?

24

A

Ignored it.

25

Q

Ignored it?

7

1

A

The court said that the Federal analogy was

2

frivolous and wholly beside the point.

3

a little later» too» that it was frivolous and wholly beside

4

the point.

5
6

Q

I want to get to that

Does the record show what percentage of

eligible voters actually voted in this election?

7

A

The record does not show that.

I can tell

8

you» and I have the agreement of my counsel her®» there were

9

8»911 registered voters in Roane County at the time of this

10

election.

11

was approximately 5»700 people voted» that approximately 60

12

percent of the eligible voters voted.
Q

13
14

Do you know what your normal turnout is in

a — was this a general election here?
A

15
16

The record does show that hew many persons voted

This was not a general election; this was a

special election.

17

Q

Special election.

18

A

And this was a rather excellent turnout» I

Q

This is an excellent turnout for a bond

A

I think that the turnout was an excellent

19

think

20
21

election.

22
23

turnout.

24

Q

Yes.

25

A

For a rural area in the spring when the roads
8

!

were bad and these were generally scheduled, I might add, Mr»

2

Justice White, so that -there wouldn't be too heavey a turnout,

3

Q

Well, that's not unusual,

4

A

No; I'm certain of that,

5

Q

Do you know what your turnout is in a

6

general election year?
A

7
8

It would be strictly a guess, but I would

say rougly 75 percent.

We have a politically-minded county.

9

So, as I have said in answer to the question by

10

Mr. Justice Harlan, it’s not a mathematical problem; it's a

11

philosophical problem.

12

And of course --

13

Q

Suppose, Counsel, if this were a mathematical

14

problem, essentially, it could be reasonably argued that on

15

the Respondents8 theory, one-third of the registered voters,

16

are commiting the credit of all of the registered voters.

17

There were about 28 or 2900 for the bond issue; were there

m

not?

^

19

A

Yes; 2800-odd; yes.

20

Q

Now, 'that argument, if it’s mathematics, a
-

21

22

third — normally a third of the people 'are commuting 8900
people, 2800 people —

23

A

Yes, sir.

24

Q

What would you say if, the position were the

25

other way; if it only took a 30 percent vote in favor to pass
9

j

the bond Issue?

1

z

T

A

I would say the same thing? I-think itEs

4

Q

That there is no majority rule either way.

5

A

I think not»

valid.

3

I think with a situation of a

6

minority veto — of course our constitution and our history is

7

full of instances of minority vetos, and not necessarily

8

minority rule ~
Q

9

And full of constitutional provisions to

protect 'the minority?

10
1!

A

I!m sorry* Mr. Justice.

12

Q

And full of constitutional provisions to

protect minorities?

13

A

14

Yes.

Before this decision I thought that was

what the 14th Amendment was all about.

15

There is one thing that I think is pivotal(?) here

16

— the essence of the 14th Amendment in a voting situation is

17

that every voter should have equality of voting power.

18

And I believe that the court below more or less conceded it.

19

The California court* in its scholarly decision* a 62-page

20

decision* I think* did concede* and I believe that my adver­

21

sary here* and I think we would all have to admit that when­

22

ever the -- and in a situation like this * when any man enters

23

the voting booth* when all the voters first go to the polls*

24

before the election is held* each has exactly the same

25

I

1

opportunityi each has exactly -the same power to affex^g. the

2

ultimate decision, as every other voter, regardlesX'o?how he

3

votes.

4

election when he goes in.

He's got the same power to affect the outcome of the

5

Now, this wasn't the case in any of the one-man,

6

one-vote cases andin those cases it seems to me the state had

1

told its people; regardless of how you'vote, your vote as a

8

resident of this populous county can't have as much effect

9

on the ultimate decision-making process as a vote of the man

SO

who lives in the less populous, rural areas»
But, surely the state has told that; you each have

IS
12

votesi each has the equal power to affect the outcome»

13

fore the majority requirement is merely a rule of decision!

14

it prescribes how many votes it takes to win.

15

not a majority, but 60 percent of the votes to win.
g

16

There­

No plurality;

What if West Virginia should say that in order

17

to elect a Republican candidate it took 60 percent of the

18

votes; but in order to elect a Democratic candidate it only

19

took 50 percent.
A

20

That would be monstrous.

I think that would

21

be monstrous, and of course in violation of equal protection

22

of the lav;.

23

and subject to discrimination.

24

equally in such a measure.

25

Q

The candidates are individuals; they are people
They could be treated un­

But here you say that in order to impose a
11

1

tax levy or to impose bond indebtedness, it takes 60 «percent

a

of the vote, but on other issues it takes 50 percentT** ^

3

A

Well, the affirmative of a bond issue, or a

4

negative of a bond issue is not a person subject to dis-

3

crimination.

6

7

Q

No, but I simply ~ aren't there other

issues in which it only takes a majority?

8

Q

Like a constitutional amendment?

9

A

A constitutional amendment is one? certainly»

10

I don't know that there is any constitutional distinction be­

1!

tween those two,

12

which the people of the state have spoken to.

13

Q

I think that’s a question of public policy

Well, what if the law, the West Virginia law

14

was that negative votes be counted twice and affirmative votes

15

be counted once on bond issues?

16

A

17

the voters, I think that would be bad.

20
21

A

Q

Well, if such a provision were addressed to

Well, it would get just exactly the same

result; wouldn't it?
A

Possibly, on a mathematical basis? yes, I

think it would, except it would give you a —

Well it would —

This restricts the power of

It cannot borrow money unless you

Well, the law could say that in all political

negative votes would be counted once-and-a-half and affirmative

have precisely the same result on a mathematical basis, but it

is not a question of —
Q

12
13

Well, wouldn’t you make the same argument,

though, there, that --

14

A

No, I couldn’t make that argument —

IS

Q

Why?

16

A

Because the voters would be treated un­

n

equally.

18

this — Mr. Justice White.

19

that is to carry his side of the issue.

20

same power when he goes into the polls I don’t think he loses

21

that power, that equality of power by casting his ballot.

22

Here the voter — every man stands equally before

Q

Every man has the same burden?
And if he has the

Well, on my example he has the same power

23

when he goes in, too, because he doesn’t know which side he's

24

going to be on until the vote is counted.

25

A

But the way that example was put, I think,
13

1

of course, is not this case, but it wouldn't be a question of

2

voting»

1 think it would be discriminating between people»

3

Q

Well, Mr» Scott, overriding a Presidential

4

veto, in the Houses of Congress, under the Federal Constitu­

5

tion, negative votes have twice the voting value as affirma­

6

tive votes? don’t they?

7

A

Well, they certainly have —

8

Q

--- to take Justice White’s illustration»

9

A

Well, they certainly have twice the effect.

10

I’m not sure that the — that specific context is justificati os:

11

for a state

12

Federal analogy hasn’t met with very much favor at the hands

13

of this Court, although I do want to employ it later on, and

!4

I think it is a valid argument.

15

to treat its citizens unequally and that the

Q

Well, in each case the parallel to the veto

power overriding the veto of the President in each case: West

17

Virginia’s constifcutionand the Federal constitution, it’s a

It certainly is, Your Honor, Mr» Chief

21

Justice.

three separate occasions by a majority vote, and have volun­

23

tarily, by a majority vote, restricted the powers of the

majority, designed to protect the rights of the minority in

Q

There are many people who couldn't vote in

S

this bond issue who are going to have to pay off the bonded

indebtedness; aren’t they?

8

A

9

That’s quite so, Mr» Chief Justice, and I

think it’s analogous to a mortgage of real estate; it is,

10

in effect, a mortgage of property even to persons not born at

11

the time of the election.

12

born who will own property and will have to pay taxes on it

as minors, before the bonds retire.

There are many reasons and many justifications for

get to a justification of this, though, because I don’t think

it is discriminatory.

12

substantial constitutional deficiencies.
I don't think that when a person enters the poll

15

that he loses any of the equality that he had before he went

nia case where they held

rested on one thin thread and when it said that if yens'

19

classified voters that it was sufficient for the class to come

20

into being at or after the election.

21

22

And I think this is the basic error made in the Califor­
and their entire ,62-page opinion

It was not necessary for

there to be prospective discrimination; it was sufficient if it
came

into being retrospectively.
And I think that there is no such thing as a

23
24

class here.

There isn't even an identifiable group if secrecy

ORAL ARGUMENT BY CHARLES C. WISE, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

4

MR. WISE:

5
6

Thank you, Mr. Scott.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
In our view we are dealing here with a voting, an

7

8

election case that of course does determine questions of

9

whether or not bonds may be issued or excess levies applied,

10

but it also equally determines whether or not a school will

11

be built for the use of students 20 years in the future as

12

well as the issue of paying for it.
There is certainly no requirement, to our know­

13
14

ledge, that the West Virginia Constitution was required to

15

submit to the voter an issue such as this, but it is refresh­

16

ing that it does do soon auchan important matter: education?

17

and having done so, it seems to us that as all roads once led

18

to Rome, the well-established powers of the decisions of this

19

Court in the denial of the vote cases, and in the waiting and

20

debasement of dilution cases, as well as discrimination of

21

subject matter, found in Hunter versus Erickson, are appli­

22

cable here.

23

the person who, because of his conviction on the issue of

24

whether or not bonds shall ba issued, determines whether or

25

not his vote is to be counted 50 percent more than that of

Because, there is an effect, no doubt but that

21

1

another of opposite conviction.

2

Q

Is the SUHl total of your argument that the

3

14th Amendment forbids the state to have any election unless

4

it provides for a result that will abide by the majority

5

vote?

6

A

|

Mr. Justice Black» I think that the line

7

will have to be drawn somewhere and we certainly wouldn't

B

contend that elections in very restricted areas or dealing

&

with restricted acres or dealing with the internal procedures

10

of a legislature or something of that kind would require a

ft

majority.

But, we think that when we have ~

12

Q

Who decides where that line is drawn?

13

A

This Honorable Court, sir, and we think that

14

within the framework of these decisions it is almost in

15

escapable that when we are dealing with an election on an

16

important issue on a county-wide basis when a citizen has so

17

little opportunity now of direct participation in an important

18

result, that there may be better reasons for applying the 14th

19

Amendment to this than in the election of a representative

20

where the citizen’s interest is certainly not quite as direct

21

a —

22

Q

Well, there is no question of whether or not

23

the 14th Amendment applies to West Virginia; of course it

24

applies to West Virginia.

or not we can apply the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, by

In this particular area? right.

S

Q

Yes.

6

Q

And as I now understand you in connection

7

with your second answer# you say the 14th Amendment forbids

a

the states to permit an election on a particular issue it

3

chooses to submit to the people to permit that to be decided

10

by less than 50 percent — by more than 50 percent# unless

11

this Court somehow decides that it would be wiser and better

12

to let that election stand?
A

13

Well# Mr. Justice Black# what I meant was

9

A

It would determine whether or not the 14th

Amendment would apply to this.
Q

1?

What about a requirement in the West Virginia

12

Constitution that 50 percent plus 1, a majority of all the

13

registered voters would be required to contract bonded in­

14

debtedness.

Would you think that would be unconsfcituional?

.15

A

No, sir; I don't think so.

16

Q

That would requiri 4500 votes, in round

17

figures here? wouldn't it?

18

A.

I believe that would be a proper restriction.

19

Q

It would foe far more difficult to obtain that

20

kind of a majority than 60 percent of the voters actually

21

voting? wouldnst it?

22

A

Yes.

It is certainly true that it is

23

difficult to get a voter turnout under these conditions in a

24

special election.

25

fixed, on that basis it would foe much easier to get a greater

A

I think it would be a great error of policy

to make that type of requirement because we have had a con­
stitution for 98 years with practically no change, and efforts

13

to amend it have met with a very frustrating experience

14

ultimately, and nothing happened •— it was rather typical»

15

Q

Well, how do you ■— did I understand that

16

the legislature did, by a two-thirds vote, adopt a constitu­

17

tional amendment, and that the people rejected it?

18

A

That is correct»

19

Q

Well, then how were they legislatively

20

frustrated?

21

A

They weren't legislatively frustrated»

22

Q

They just frustrated themselves.

23

A

That is correct, and of course this Court

24

pointedout in the Lucas case against the

25

Colorado, the mere fact that there has been approval by the

25

Assembly of

voters of an apportionment plan does not in anywise take the

proposal away from the requirements of the 14th Amendment,

Well, a majority of the voters in West

18

Virginia could change the constitution of West Virginia to

20

by a majority of the voters actually voting?

21

A

Yes, sir.

22

Q

Is there initiative in West Virginia?

23

A

No,, sir? we have no initiative and it requires

24
23

a two-thirds conferring vote of both houses cf the legislature.
Q

But you don8t challenge?

26

!

A

No, sir.

We do have a provision for calling

But, basically,. Your Honors, it is our position

and we think it goes back even beyond Gray»

Black in CoIgrive against Green in 846 in a dissenting opinion,

7

pointed out that no one would argue that if you gave to one

S

voter one-half of the weight given to another voter you would

9

have an invalid situation.

Mr» Justice

Gray certainly makes that clear

1©

and as we see it, all of fch© equality cases go to the point

11

that the same weight, substantially, must be given to the

12

views of ' each one»

of the outcome of an issue that a voter may have»

form of government and in the final analysis there seems to be

exceptions to most rules somewhere along the line.

Even in the face of the 14th Amendment -—

Mr. Wise; I assume that if the state legis­

that the result of applying to each voter equal weight in his

21

the application on even theoretical grounds, of going to the
point of"destroying the traditional balance of power between

31

And that would be the

But we do say that under the Ray against Sanders

local issues, has been subject to the application of the

4

14th Amendment like Avery against Midlands; the cases that

5

have recently been decided in 1969 and 1970, stich as Kramer

6

and Cipriano, and Phoenix, which go to the question of issuance

of bond and the requirements for example, in Cipriano, that it

is impermissible for Louisiana to require by legislation a

9

50 percent vote and a 50 percent

And in the case of Phoenix, as well as Cipriano,

11

of course, the Court vary properly pointed out that you cannot

12

make the voting classification on the basis of whether or not

13

you are a real property taxpayer.

14

But in our view, Carrington against Rash, the

15

Erickson decision, make it even more invidious if the dis­

16

crimination is based upon the views that a man holds at to

the outcome of an election.

I find that difficult to follow, Mr. Wise, in

22

light of the proposition that we -- that you and I seem to

23

agree on with reference to 50 percent, a majority of all

24

registered voters be required because then the man who stays

25

home might have a non-vote Which would carry more weight than
32

the man who took the trouble to go down to the polls and vote .

going to have risk and encourage them to get out and vote

also submit that there, if it is applicable here, Mr» Justice

7

White, that there is no compelling state interest that would

preclude or make it proper to permit this provision to stand»

9
10

Philosophically there is an inconsistency
We

Section 8 of Article 10 of our constitution,
another section of the very article that's involved here, has
an absolute limit on bonded indebtedness and on excess levy.

12

In lieu of that, even with the 60 percent vote in successive

13

elections and for a period of time

can you go beyond five

14

percent of the assessed valuation.

Of course that constitutes

15

the best way to prevent extravagant government.

16

-And it was pointed out earlier in connection with

17

our provision of the constitution involved here, the hope was

18

expressed that this would have something to do with preventing

19

that profligacy»

20

have you such provisions in their constitiitions or laws, seem

21

to be able to be just as economical and handle these matters

22

just as effective as the 16 ©r 17 which clearly do contain

23

provisions of this kind, either in their organic law or in

24

their statutes.

As a matter of fact, the 30-odd states that

As a matter of fact, there has been a great body

33

1

sophisticated knowledge respecting bond issues and taxes that

2

has blown up in recent years, the rating services and matters

of that kind which do a much better job than restrictive

4

legislative or constitutional provisions do in attempting to

5

prevent the local governmental bodies from going overboard

and making extravagant expenditures .

On that basis we respectfully suggest that the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY GEORGE M. SCOTT, ESQ.

13

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. SCOTT:

14

15

Thank you, Mr. Wise.

If it please the Court, Mr. Chief

Justice:
By way of rebuttal I would like to respond to two

16

17

or three things.

Mr. Wise just made the point that the 30-odd

18

states which don’t have this rule, don’t seem to be spend­

19

thrifts and are getting along all right.

20

also well to remember that the 20-odd states which do have,

21

at least a great percentage of them, as far as we know, are

22

getting along all right in the fields of education.

23

doesn't seem to have been a great hindrance to them in that

24

area.

But, I think it’s

This

V

25

The question of Mr. Justice Black was very
"

34

-

............................... .............

1

intriguing; who decides where the lines ought to be drawn in

2

this case, and of course I would love to argue that this is

3

a political question, nonjusticiable and if there is anything

4

left of that political, nonjusticiable political question here.

3

I think this would be a classic example for its application»
I would like to remind again also that we8 re

7

dealing here not with the question of minority rule, but the

8

question of minority veto.

And yet we elect officers every day.

11

stand the last election was at the center (?) and the lawyer

12

states that 39 percent or something like that of the votes

13

cast, will elect governors, will elect members of the legis™

14

lature, will elect, as I recall, and of course this is not a

15

matter of record, but the last man elected to the board of

16

education in Roane County received less than 30 percent of the

17

total vote cast in the election.
So, we have many instances of minority rule, which
