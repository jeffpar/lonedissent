MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; We’ll hear

arguments next in No. 5257, Labine against Vincent.

Mr. Cox?

6

ARGUMENT OF JAMES J. COX, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

8
S

MR. COX; Mr. Chief Justice and may it please
the Court.

10

This case involves the equal protection rights of an

11

ssitht year old Negro giel, from Lake Charles, Louisiana, who

12

is the daugheer of the decedent, Ezra Vincsnt.
Ezra Vincent died without having left a will, but he

13
14

bequeathed upon his child formal proof of the childs ancestry

IS

by a formal act of acknowledgement before a notary public which

16

was' recorded in the Division of Public Health Statistics

17

along with the childs birth certificate which corroborated

18

proof of parentage of Ezra Vincent of the child Rita Nell

19

Vincent.

z

Q
Mr. Cox*, in many if not tost states*, that
k
kind of acknowledgement. —■- the whole question,,

3

A

Thatas right*, and it should, Your Honor„

4

Q

Well, I mean as a matter of statute,. The

5

statute expressly provides that the acknowledgement has the

6

consequence of establishing legitimacy. But the Louisiana

7

statute—

8
9

A

Does not, Your Honor. Mr Chief Justice

Burger, I think that this is the crus and the real issue of the

10

case. It is not a question of whether or not the state, as was

11

so aptly put in Mr. Justice Harlans dissent, and the Levy and

12

Glona cases, has the right to require a formal burden '.of proof

13

standards or criteria 'which are meaningful and relevant in

14

determining the question of the states application of its lawsm

13

but in this case no matter what burden of proof was met by this

16

particular child, because of the fact that the child is saddled

17

with the stigma of illigifcimacy, this child @an inheirit nothing

18

and in fact has what is a different standard of requesting

19

support from the decedents estate.

20

This particular child had much better proof of her

21

relationship with the decedent, Ezxa. Vinvenfc, than did the

22

brothers and sisters of the decedent who came from Washington,

23

D,C, and other faraway places to claim the decendents estate

24

and were granted the decedents ©state by the Louisiana courts.

25
5

s

That is the sister could produce no marriage license

2

to show whether her parents were married. They could produce

3

no birth certificates tosshow that they were children of the

4

same parents as the decedent, Ezra Vincent, th@ir reputation

5

of proof was extremely sketchy.

6

None of the witnesses other than family members, the

7

brothers and sisters themselves could recite the names of the

8

brothers and sisters of the decedent. And yet the Louisiana

8

courts because of its penalty burden of proof situation and be­

10

cause of its tradition

1?

awarded the estate to the brothers and sisters rather than to

12

the little child,

13
14

Q

of prejudice against illigitlmates

I suppose the broghers and sisters were

rather aged people, weren't they?

IS

A

They were, Your Honor, and in fairness—

16

Q

The father was 70, the father who acknowledg­

17

ed this child as his child, was 70—

18

A

Yes,

19

Q

——wasn’t he?At the time he did that?

20

A

Yes, Your Honor., but that's not beyond the—

21

Q

I suppose at least some of his brothers

22
23

and sisters were older than he, and—
A

In fairness, Justice Stewart, I would say

24

that records were not kept in Louisiana, There were courthouse

25

fires and other

reasons why it was difficult to proove relation'
6

I

ship. By the same token th© fact of burden of proof and the

2

fact of proof of relationship is extremely significant in a

3

caseoof this sort because it goes to the question of what is

4

the states legitimate interest in legislating against a partic­

5

ular class of people.

6

Q

How old was the. mother?

7

A

The mother was 51 years old.

8

Q

And she8 s now married to Mr. Lebine.

9

A

Mr. Labine is deceased, Your Honor.

10

Q

1 see. She was married after—

11

A

She was married to James Brooks and than

12

married Mr. Labine and Mr. Labine is, now deceased, and she's

13

unmarried. She was also the mother of, it will be brought out,

14

I'm sure, in adverse argument, of other illigitimate children.
Q

13

16

was what, in between marriages?
A

17
18

At the time of the bir&h of this child, she

Thera was no marriage, Your Honor, at the

time of the birth of the child.

19

Q

She had never been married.

20

A

She had been married first to Mr. Brooks,

21

and then to Mr. Labine who is deceased.
Yes, and where along the line was this

22
23

child born?
This child was born after the death of Mr,

24
25

Labine.

7

I

Q

I see» She qas a widow»

2

A

Yes , Your HOnor.

3

Q

Is there any disability from the two par-

4

ents marrying at the time,, in that one might have been married

5

to someone else?

6
7
8

A

Ezra Vincent, Your Honor, was not married,

neither was Mrs, Labine, there was no disability»
Q

As you move along in your argument, will

9

you touch upon the question whether if you prevail with reapect

JO

to this little child, the same would be true with any illigiti**

11

mate child whether acknowledged or not, if paternity were

12

established?

13

A

Mr. Justice Blackmun,

the question of

14

burden of proof and standards of proof are questions which

15

would be more appropriately resolved by judicial declarations
9

16

and statutes» Statutes from the standpoint of setting reason­

17

able burdens and judicial declarations if the burdens ere un­

18

reasonable o

19

Here we have a case where there's an impossible

20

burden, either the parents of the child would have had to marry,

21

in order to satisfy the statute or would have had to adopt the

22

child, or would have had to go through a procedure whereby a

23

certain shiboleth would have had to be observed, that is they

24

would have had to state

25

imate the child, or---

the Declaration of Intent to legit­

S

1

Q

Or draw a will.

£

A

Or draw a will. On the other hand, the

3

state, it is our contention, Justice Blackmun and we resprct-

4

fully submit to YOur Honor, the state cannot presume a dis­

S

criminatory intention, and that is what the state has done in

e

this case.

7

In fact the state of Louisiana has filed an amicus

8

curaie brief stating that illigitimate children are the

9

proper subjects of this sourt of legialation and inferring that

10

robbers can be classified, why cannot illligitimates be class-

11

ified?

12

And we realize that—

13

Q

Well I just wanted to be sure that your

14

due process argument wouldn’t be carried all the way to benefit

15

any other illigifcimatechiid. Once paternity was established. I

16

take it you're drawing a line between the two.

17

A

As a matter of standing before the Court

13

as an officer of the court I would say that to draw the line

19

at formal acknowledgement would be perhaps an inappropriate

20

line. The uniform probate code recommerided by the Uniform

21

Commissioness on State Laws recommends that any child should

22

be treated as legitimate if proof of paternity is established

23

during/the lifetime of the parent, the father. Or thereafter

24

by clear and convincing proof.

25

Ours is not that hard a case. But this perhaps is good
9

t

legislatione.

z

Ours is a case where, the proof ©f paternity is s©

3

clear and unequivocalXe that we have to look at the states

4

intentions in discriminating against the child» Admittedly,

S

we stand to

6

ries, but thousands of years of discrimination against illicit-

7

imates be set aside.

8
9

throw this out of the court asking that not centu­

This court has never hesitated in the past to confront
issues wherein clear and convincing proof of discrimination

10

against a particular class is shown, no matter what the histor­

11

ical antecedents may have been.

12

In fact in Levy and Glona the fact of discrimination

13

against illigitimates has been held to be unconstitutional9

14

in the context of wrongful death actions,, which involves

15

property rights as well,
Q

16

Mr, Cox, do you need to do more than per­

17

suade that where there has been formal acknowledgement in a

18

lifetime of the alleged father, that that's enough to satisfy

19

the claim?

20

A

2!

this court,

22

Q

This is the case and controversy before

Well, do you have to do any more than

23

that? Do you have to take on this whole class inc&uding those

24

who have never had the beeefit of that acknowledgement?

25

A

Only in order to answer hypothefcfe posed by
10

;

1

Your Honors* Beeuase I think that if formal acknowledgement is

2

sufficient to carry the burden of proof perhaps other methods

3

and molds of proof would satisfy Your Honors also*

4
S

Q

You couldn't get anything much stronger

than a formal acknowledgement™””

6

A

We're very fortunate in that respect—

7

Q

That was made here»

8

A

We're vary fortunate in that respect as

9

far as having a case and controversy before this Court.

be satisfied by the record here , do you happen to know?
A

12

13

How many states have a statute that would

In one of the amicus euraie briefs various

references—

14

Q

I saw some references—

15

A

—and differentiations are made. The

16

brief of thE American Civil Liberties Unito , written by the

17

eminent writer in the field; primarily Professor Harry D.Krause,

18

joined

19

out that, I believe in perhaps at least 16 states, if I'm not

20

mistaken but I don't have the figures before Me, Your Honor.

21

by Mr. Melvin Wulf and Mr. Norman Dorsen, he points

Under various conditions, this is at page 12 of his

22

brief, for eaample, in Arizona, California, Florida, Idaho, and

23

I donknww, Your Honor, that North Dakota has changed its law

24

as a result of the In Re Estate of Jensen case which would

25

make a fifth of & sixth state in which this particular case

11

s

WOULD not needs have arisn before this Court,

a

In In Re Estate of Jensen, the state of Worth Dakota,

3

after the Levy and Glona cases the Worth Dakota Supreme Court

4

rightly applied Levy and Glona to an inheiratance ease and

5

said that the Worth fiakota statute was unconstitutional discrim-

6

ination against Illigitiroates and allowed an iiligiiimat® to

7

inheirito

3

Not only did this illigitimate ehild not inheirit

9

her fathers estate but the Louisian© Courts felt that since

10

she .was recieving

11

and V.A. Benefits that she was not entitled to support becuase

12

of the standard which the statute established as support for

13

an illigitimate, which is to proave actual necessity,,

14

a hundred dollars a month in Social Security

This is a heavier standard than a recognized child

15

has to establish. The cMlds needs were shown to be $192.30

16

per month but becuase Of the fact that she's illigitimate she

17

must continue to live in a condition of destitution.

18

As we view it, Your Honors, the: real issues in this

19

case is does the denial of inheiratance rights to illigi&imates

20

promote a genuine state interest in family unity? And if it

21

does so promote it, can this be promoted in a haphazard fashion?

22

We would concede that family unity is something that

23

is very much of a concern to the states and something which

24

could be very well promoted.

25

Eor instance,the state of Louisiana could well legis-

12

?

late a bonus for parents who remained together and cared for

2

their children. To the contrary the state of Louisiana has

3

passed a statute legislating against parents who stay together

4

for welfare purposes. If parents remain together and they have

S

dependent children and they're destitute they're ineligible in

6

the state of Louisiana for welfare.
This appears in Louisiana revised statutes

7
3

46s231. Therefore Louisian® certainly is pursuing a most pecul­

9

iar course if it's genuinely trying to promote family unity in
t

10

the field of legitimate relationships between parents and

11

children.

12

Furthermore—-

13

Q

Wall, that's true everywhere * isn't it, tha ;

14

that where a state has a welfare program in cooperation with

IS

the £ederal government the aid to dependent children program.

16

That’s what you’re talking about, isn’t it?

17

A

Yes, Your Honor. By the same token, some

IS

states in applying this type ®f statute

19

further against illigitimates by invoking the"substitute father?;

20

doctrine which is that if there were an illigitimate father in

2!

the household he would be presumed to fee the parent of all the

22

children therein and therefore illigitimacy situation would

23

exclude all of the children from benefits.

24
25

have tried to go

How this Court had no trouble with this type of

1
i;

j

statute in Arkansas. In Smith vs. King, this Court struck this
13

!
I

?

2

down as a denial of the equal protection and due process laws.
Furthermore,, if the state of Louisiana is to be

3

consistent in pursuing the doctrine of family unity and pro™

4

moting legitimacy, they should, we feel, pay some attention

5

to the recent statistics.

6

Aecording to the trends of illigitimacy in the United

7

States from 1940 - 1965, which was published by the National

8

Center for Health Statistics in February of 1968, Louisiana

9

had more illigitimate births per capita than states which did

10

11
12

13

not follow this particular oppressive approach to illigitimacy.
Q

I was puzzled by your emphasis on that in

your briefs. Whats the real connection between the two?
A

Well this was in the amicus curaie biiiefs,

14

Your Honor. This is anticipating an argument that the approach

15

&o promoting family unity and encouraging legitimacy is based

1©

on common sense.

17

Q

Wall, arent8 you iconfusing the declared

18

purpose of the legislative body in making enactment and the

19

actual consequence as nearly as anyone can discern? They can

20

have as a decleired purpose legitimately, they objectively state

21

it doesn’t proeve anything that the statistics have some ten-

22

dency to go the other way.

23

A

Well, theye must be some real and viable

24

relationship between thedeclared purpose and th® actual state

25

©f facts, Mr. Chief Justice Burger-—

14

!

Q

But you don81 know—

Z

A

By the — admission—

3

Q

You don8t know* you have no way of knowing

4

that absent the statute the situation might be a lot worse in

5

Louisiana, That’s my point,I can't see that that's a very

6

strong ground,

1

A

I can't really argue with that—

8

Q

That8s my point* nobody knows and—

9

A

Mobody really knows—

10

Q

That5s not a very reliable yardstick for

A

Mo* I don't think that pursuing these

ft
12

anything.

13

figures could come up with anything resembling an answer

14

except to say that Justice Stewarts observation in the case of

15

Shelton vs. Tucker is pertinent.

16

This Court in that case pointed out that even though

17

the governments purpose might be legitimate in this case

18

perhaps the promotion of family unity by legislating in the

19

field of legitimacy * this purpose might be ligitimate, that

20

purpose can't be pursued by means that stifle individual rights

21

and that are overbroad* or overencompasing„

22

G

Is that the First Amendment case?

23

A

Yes* it was* Your Honor* --- the language

24

there* let me pose this question* to you* Justice Stewart, If

25

legislating against legitimacy is a valid purpose* which we

15

1

concede it is, would it not be overbroad to say that not only

2

must a parent formally acknowledge the child; but must also

3

declare that he intends to legitimate the child,

4

to accomplish that purpose?
Q

5

6

in order

Do you want me t© answer that question

now or later?

7

A

I'm sure I will recieve an answer, but

8

this is what8s going to be the question here fromthe standpoint

9

of this childs rights,

10

Q

Well Mr, Cox aren't you on stronger grounds

II

to simply take the old thesis that one of the predicates on

12

this problem has been that it exposes people to fraudulent

13

claims which are difficult to establish proof of-—. And that

14

none of those factors are served when a &tate denies this

IS

right

16

the father?

17

A

to one as to whom fehere is

no question on the part of

I would like to take those grounds in my

18

argument. Blackstones commentaries, which might be used as the

19

historical prededent to show that this is not an unusual bit

20

of legislation, specifically mentions the reason as these fraud­

21

ulent claims, and for thousands of years in both the civil and

22

the common law we have this situation that where an overbroad

23

sealousness andpersuing these illigitimates kho have had noth­

24

ing to say about theirs status.

25

Here this little child could do nothing about her
16

1

situation. Her father who was attempting to do what he could

z

about her status, formally acknowledged her, and joining in

3

this particular approach we feel that it’s too much to require

4

that they go beyond formal acknowledgement.
Q

5
6

Is it quite accurate to say that the father

did what he could? He could hade drawn a will.

7

A

He could have, Your Honor—

8

Q

Which is a lot easier than going through

9

adoption procedures or--A

10

He could have. Justice Blackmun, but it's

11

every mans right not to draw a will

and I do notfeel, speaking

12

for the little child, I'm not engaging in a colloquy with the

13

Court, that this child should not have any heavier burden after

14

the proof of relationship to her parent than any other child '

15

is

concerned.
The state presumes an intention on the part of those

16

17

who don’t draw wills in Louisiana to exclude illigitimates. And

13

this is unconstitutional assumption of state power and dele­

1©

gation of equal protection rights.
Q

20

I would suppose, perhaps, that.the state

21

woudi assume an intention on the part of the decedent who did

22

not draw a will that his property should go under the state

23

laws of

24

could have drawn a will and left all his property to his

25

child, since he did not draw a will wouldn’t the natural as sump-

dissent and distribution. The father of this child

17

3

tion be 'that he intended his property to go by the Louisians

2

laws of dissent and distribution, i .e. to his brothers and

3

sisters?

4

A

If those laws were constitutional, I would

5

imagine that the man in the street thinks that the laws are

6

constitutional, Your Honor, talking to ordinary people, and

1

that's not before this Court, -this doesn't shock, I mean the

3

idea of an illigitimafe inheiriting if he's formally acknowledged

9

he's formally acknowledged, seems to be what most people think

10

the law would be.

11

And——

12

Q

That doesn't meet the problem that is posed,

13

that the state makes a will for all people who do not take the

14

trouble to make one for themselves,, And a man, it's a common

15

thing for lawyers, to be consulted by people with no great

16

means, in finding out what they want to do, to tel.l

17

they don't seed a will because what they want is what is already

18

provided for thy the statutes» Now I'm certain that that's

19

common to lawyers all over the country»

20
2!
22

them that

In other words they say tie state had made a will for
you so you don't need to bother,
A

Once lawyers know what this honorable Court

23

holds to be what the constitution means when it says equal pro™

24

fcection of the law, which most people think they know, then

25

the attorneys won't be giving adivce not to do something one way

18

1

or another»

2

If you want to exclude your illigitimate child, which

3

you can't do, by the way, if the child is granted equal pro­

4

tection by

5

portion»

-

Louisiana, the child would recieve a forced

6

Q

That's equal protection with what?

7

A

With other children» With children simii™

8

iarly situated except with the accident of what their parents
had done»

10

Q

You're not saying that Louisiana could

11

not constitutionally leave all children, ligitimate, or illigit­

12

imate, out of the laws of intestacy» Or are you?

IS

A

That would be-—this has never been done in

14

this state, Mr. Justice Blacfcraun„ I'm not saying that they

15

coiildn't but it certainly wouldn’t promote what common sense

16

dictates, that is that partens support their children, and

17

leave — methods of support.

18

Q

I come back to the question that I orig­

1

inally asked, and I realize as the Chief Justice indicated that

20

you don't have to go this far, but I wonder how you can, if

21

you prevail constitutionally here, you don't also carry with

22

you every illigitimate child whose paternity is established

23

fo^s other methods that formal acknowledgement» I would suspect

24

that you do»

to that question that it would depend upon the way that this
.

Court rules»

3

I don't believe that becuase the particular standard

4

is unconstitutional,, that every standard under other circum­

5

stances would be unconstitutional.

6

I can only appear before this honorable Court with

7

a case in which a clearly unconstitutional standard has been

8

placed upon a child under which equal protection has been de­

9

nied this child.

10
11

Q

Now in this case there were no ligitimate

children of the decednet?

12

A

13

Q

There were no li^xtimate children.
So in this case, with respect to this

14

property, there was no discrimination among his children, was

IS

there?

IS

A

There was discrimination against—

17

Q

No child—

18

A

-•=*- the child, though.

19

Q

The brothers and sisters got the property.

20

A

That"s right, and — -

21

Q

There

was no discriminationas between

22

ligitimate children and illigitimate children of this decedent,

23

was there?

24
25

A

There was discrimination as

between an

illigitimate child, and Xigitimafee brothers and sisters.
20

1

But because of the fact that—

2

Q

3

Two quite different classes of people» There

4

was no, well I think that you have answered by question, if there
j
were no ligitimate children than there was no discrimination

5

as among children in this case.

6

A

That's correct, Your Honor.

7

Q

But if this Petitioner had been ligitimate

8

9

1

fehe would have automatically inherrited, is that right?
A

That's correot. This is where I feel that

10

the discrimination comes in. This particular child was dis­

11

criminated against soley because this child was illigitimate.
i

12

And we don't mean to go as far as the briefs filed

13

by the amicus curaie, which raise the question of racial dis­

14

crimination. We don't think that the state intends racial dis­

IS

crimination. But we think the state intends a discrimination

16

between ligitimates and illigitimates„

17

Which is a class of discrimination which has gone on

18

for centuries, in which inrodds have been made in other cases.

19

But when it comas to this particular child, thefact that others

20

in other states and the Supreme Courts of other states have

j

21

said that these were unconstitutional enactments does not help

j

22

this child becuase our Sppreme Court says its perfectly con­

23

stitutional .

24
25

So we are forced into a position of having to ask re­
dress from this Court,, I'd like to say21

I

Q

Suppose the legislature had passed a law

2

which said that no father of illigitimate children in this

3

state should be permitted ti exclude their illigitimate child"

4

ren» That all fathers must give as much to their illigitimate

5

childffien as they give to their; ligitiaaate children.

6
7

A

This would be a good and a valid way to

clear the problem.

8

G

What?

9

A

This would be a good way to clear the

W

problem, Mr. Justice Black, but when the legislature does not

11

do it,"""

12

Q

The legislature just left it open, I presume

13

for a man to dispose, let his property go as he felt best, under

14

the law.

IS

Didn’t it?
A

Admittedly, Mr. Justice Black, the father

16

could have left to his illigitimate child what he did to his

17

ligitimate brothers and sisters, but we get into the area p£

18

presuming the intention of the testator. This is what the state

W

has done, the legislature has presumed that all testators intend
S

20
2!
22
23

to exclude illigitimates.
But the legislature also presumes and it. said that a
parent cannot exclude ligitimate childrem.
Q

Why would n't the nest step be, under your

24

argument to say that it's not fair, it denied equal protections, j

25

it's bad policy for a father not to have to leave some of his

22

I

money to his illegitimate children? Why shouldn't the Court

a

decide that denied due process under equal protection?

3

A

Well 1 submit that-—••

4

Q

Why weiildn't that be about the next argu­

6

A

Z don't understand.

7

Q

Well, the next argument that there's not

5

ment?

8

lav? on it but the courts should hold that it denies equal

9

protection to permi± a father to discriminate against his illig­

10

itimate children.
A

11

That step may very well come because a

12

father cannot discriminate against Xigitimate children in Lou­

13

isiana, why should a father be able to discriminate against

14

illigitimate children?
We have a forced heirship law in Louisiana, Mr. Justice

IS
16

Black. I understand the philosophic argument, but the state

17

of Louisiaia presumes that parents have t© provide for thier

18

children, and are not allowed discrimination against children.

19

20

Q

cannot, disinhsirifc his children?
A

21

You mean that under Louisiaia Law, a man

That is correst„ Your Honor. But he can

22

dislnheirit his illigitimate children by not saying anything.

23

Add he doesn't intend to.

.

24'
25

Q

Well, if he hadn’t intended to, he could

have — it under Louisiana Law. He could have made a will, and
23

1

left part of his property.

2

A

Yes, he could have, Your Honor.

3

Q

Well would you answer that for ma again,

4

he could have made a will and what?

5

6

A

He could have made a will and he CQuId have

left his property to his illigitimate child, if he s© desired.

7

Q

At the expense of hisligitimate children?

8

A

He had none, sohe could

9

©

Suppose he did.

10

A

Ho, he could not have. They would have been

not.

11

forced to the same extent. There's a small disposable portion

12

that he can distribute—

13

Q

So that by will he cannot give his entire

14

estate to charity, to the exclusion of children, under Louisiana

IS

law?

10

17

IS
19

A

That's correct, Your Honor, I3d like to

save the balance of my time for rebuttal. Thank you.
Q

Mr, Leithead.
ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. KEITHEAD, .ESQ.

20

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE

21

MR. LEITHEADs Mr. Chief Justice, and may

22

it please the Court.

23

This matter factually doesn’t present any question.

24

These people merely came in after Essra Vincent d.i<§d, and said

25

that they were the brothers and sisters and wanted to open his

24

!

succession» In Louisiana, under the intestate laws, if

2

son dies leaving no children, then you look to the intestate

3

laws to see which classes of; "persons inheirit his estate.

4

a per-»

Louisiana has legal hairs, in connection with their

S

intestate succession. In this particular case, since Ezra Vin­

8

cent didn't leave any children, he left brothers and sisters,

7

and he left an acknowledged illigitiraate child, under the law

8

©f Louisiana, the: .intestate succession laws, the brothers and

S sisters are declared inheirited before the acknowledged illigi™
10
11
12

13

timafce child.
Q

Does an acknowledged illigitiraate child

come anywhere in the hierarchy?
A

Yes. the acknowledged illigitiraate, some­

14

body asked why did he acknowledge his child? First in Louis­

15

iana you have an illigitiraate child, -which is the lowest you

16

can get. Then you have an adknowledged illigitiraate child, and

17

that acknowledged illigitiraate child is raised in his status

IS

as being able to inheirit.

19

He can inheirit from his mother just after her li~

20

gitimate children. H@ can inheirit from the father just after

21

the wife, which is just before the state. He doesn't have as

22

high an inheiritahce position in the estate of his father, as

23

he does in his mother. Becuase Louisiana recognizes the natural

24

law that a child is closer to its mother than it is to its

25

father. But he does have inheiritanee rights.
25

1

Q

If this decedent had died, leaving no

2

brothers and sisters and no issue of any siblings,, would this

3

child have inheirited?

4

A

This child would have inheirited, because

5

the law states that if a man dies leaving no ligitimate child

6

ren, no mother and father, and no surviving wife, than his

7

acknowledged child inheirits.

8
9
10

Q

Well, wait a minute» This man didn't have

a mother or a wife, did he?
A

No» I say, that's why the child, would have
i

11

12

13

inheirited, if he did not have brothers and sisters»
Q

Oh, yes, because the brothers and sisters,

in this case the brothers and sisters come fehead, don't they?

14

A

Yes»

15

©

But if there had been no brothers and sis­

16

ters here, the appellant would have inheirited.

17

A

That’s correct.

18

Q

Under the laws of dissent and distribution.

19

A

That is correct.

20

Q

And from the natural mother I suppose you

2!

dont need to have any certification! of parenthood, from the

22

mother, do you?

23

A

Proof of the motherhood is very easily made,

24

the mother knows, there’s usually a witmess, a midwife or some­

25

thing, to the birth of the child. But the children of the mother

26

1

com© in just after her ligitimate children, If she had no digit-

2

irnate children they would inheirit to the exclusion of all

3

persons, underthe intestate laws of the state,

4

Q

Well what is the reason for drawing the

5

line between ligitimate and illigitimate children insofar as

6

the mother is concerned?

7

A

The state realises that the mother has

8

a close family connection to the—well to answer your question

9

completely--

SO

Q

Why should she have more of a close family

II

relation with the llligitxmate children than with the ligitimate

12

children?

13

j
|
j

A

The

state of Louisiana now has a policy

14

of preferring ligitimaey over illigitiraacy* And in connection

15

with that policy, it8s obvious that they prefer ligitimate

16

heir® to illigitimate heirs. And their policy is to promote

17

marriage and discourage illigitimaey and also for the protection

18

of their land titles,

19

Q

To promote the marriage of the illigitimate

20

child or its mother? Because the illigitimate child is the

2!

one that suffers,

22

\

A

That is correct. But if the parents wish to

23

they cacild prevent the illigitimate child from suffering by doincf

24

some other things and that is they could ligitimate the-child

25

by informally acknowledging the child before or after a marriage,

27

1

if they could marry. They could adopt him or they could leave

a

a will.

3
4

So there is an avenue that they could choose the
course of events.

S

Q

Pfeat course of events can the child change?

6

A

the child cannot change any course of events

7

Q

That's what I thought.,

8

A

Yes, sir.

9

Q

Somewhere

in these briefs

1 thought I re­

10

called the figure on the estimated total number of illigitimate

11

people in the country. Do you recall the figure?

12

13

A

I don't remember what those

figures are*

Your Honor,» they must be in the amicus curaie brief.

14

Q

It's a very large number* the total number

15

of all illigitimates.

16

A

17

I might comment on the factsof this case. In the Levy

Yes* sir.

18

case* Justice Douglas stated that the Court, assumed that the

19

minor children there had a family relationship with their

20

mother. That is the mothers support. That's where the illigiti**

21

mate children sought under -the Louisiana wrongful death statutes

22

for -the death of their natural mother.

23

That there was a family relationship* the mother su­

24

pported them, she took them to church* took them to school* she

25

cared for them* she lived with them* but none of those facts are
28

1

2

in this case, in the record»
This case shows , does not show that Ezra lived with

3

the child, in fact, the evidence is just to the contrary. If

4

you'll notice the acknowledgement papers and the birth certif­

5

icate it'll show that the address of the mother was somehfeing

6

on Belden Street in Lake Charles, Louisiana, whereas Esra and,

7

his family lived in a little town called Mossville which is

8

approximately 10 or 12 miles away.

9

Now the fact that there was no marriage certificate

10

between Ezra's father and mother is due to the fact that there

11

were no marriage records in Calcasieu Parish, where this man

12

lived ^, prior to 1910. And his brothers and sisters all were

13

born prior to that time. So there's no marriage records, no^

14

were there any birth certificates.

15

So we had to proove the marriage relationship of Ezra's,

16

mother and father by their reputation in the community. And in

17

so doing we found out that, thisinterest in this property that

18

Ezra Vincent left was property. He had 7 brothers and sisters,

IS

one-eighth of it constituted the bulk of this succession, which

20

amounted to approximately $15,000»

21

That was the family home. And Ezra and his brothers

22

and sisters lived there. They famed the property, they went

23

to the Baptist church together, his grandfather was a Baptist

24

minister. Their reputation in the community was such that it

25

was the highest. His family was recognized as prominent cifcisens,
29

So there was a family relationship between Ezra?

1

2
3
4

bro&hers and sisters and their parents * This was not shown
fco be the

case as by the evidence presented in this ease»
Now in common law, an illigitimate was -known as a non-

5

person. He was not entitled to inheirit anything. Louisiana law

6

permits -them to inheirit, but not as high up on the ladder as

7

ligitimate relations. Th* civil law has historically treated

8

ligitimates more favorably than ilXigitimat.es , by letting them

9

inheirit from their mother.

10
11

12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19

20
2!
22
23
24
25

The most modern statutes now permit the illigitimate
children to inheirit from their mother, but prohibit or deny
them to inheirit from their father.
Nov/ we've been talking about the child in this case,
I think the Court should also give some considernation to the
decedent. Now when he died, the laws of the state of Louisiana,
the intestate laws, was that his family property would be inheirited by his brothers and sisters.
Now at that time Ezra had a choice

to make. He could

say Now look, I want to 1 leave this child something. I want to
make a will. He could have done that. Or he could have said, 1
want fco marry the mother of the child. There was no impediment
to the marriage. Or he could have adopted the child. Anyoone of
those things would have changed the course of these events.
Now onee Ezra died, he no longer can exercise any
choice. The die was cast. This Court hannofc reverththis case
30

1

to before his death and say Now Ezra, you have the choice

2

do you want to do, because what he did indicates what his

3

choxce was»

4

Q

But if the child had been ligitimate and

5

.n5fc seem her father for the past 50 years, and was now living

6

Rome, she would have inheirited?

7

A

That’s correct.

8

Q

He could have made a will, I suppose, and

9

•SB her at least part of his property to somebody else.
A

11

If you have one child, the forced portion is

—third that you have to leave the child»

12

Q

Two thirds of the property he could have

■en still to his brothers and sisters.

13
14

A

Right.

IS

Q

While you’re pausing here, I’m looking at

16

■e 8 of the Appendix, that’s the certificate of Acknowledgement

17

Paternity» Do I read that correctly, that it’s also signed

18

by the mother?

19

A

That’s correct.

20

Q

Than, before a Notary Public and two wit-

22

A

Right, Your Honor.

23

Q

Sc that, is the formality of executing a

aesses.

21

24

-

25

will in Louisiana any more complex than this?
A

There is, No sir, A will may be executed in

31

5

Louisiana before a Notary Public and two witnesses.

2

Q

The same

3

A

The same as this. TheNotary Public

as this—
has

4

authority to take a will. So at the sametime these

S

were doing this, if Ezra wanted to he could have signed a will,

6

and left his property to his acknowledged child.

7

two parties

So all of that indicates that it was not his intention

8

to leave the family property to this acknowledged child but

9

rather to keep it with his brothers and sisters.

SO

Q

1!

A

That indicates what?
It indicates to-ray way of thinking that

12

Ezra was in the Notary5 s office and had two witnesses and did

13

not sign a will at that time, leaving his property to his ac­

14

knowledged child, it would indicate that he did not want to

IS

do that.

16
17
18

Q

Well what would be the purpose of acknow­

ledging the child?
A

To provide for the chiIds support. Now the

19

child did immediately recieve $35 a month from the Social Se­

20

curity Administration while Ezra was living, and after his

21

death is relieving between Social Seci&ifcy and Veterans Ad­

22

ministration $100 a month.

23

Q

What date was this acknowledgement made?

24

A

It's on page 8 of the Appendix,

25

Q

1962, apparently?

32

1

A

1962, Your Honor.

2

Q

The Social Security Act was passed some time

3

before that, I thinkc

4

A

Yes. Your Honor.

5

Q

By reason of the —— —

6

A

Yes, Your Honor.

7

Q

By the acknowledgement that he was the

8

father of the child.

9

A

Yes, sir.

10

Q

Did the child recieve as his child?

11

A

Yes, sir. Under the Social Security Act,

12

Q

---Social Security and Veterans benefits

13

totaling $100 a month from the United States government, and

14

then all of his property went, to his brothers and sisters.

15

A

That’s correct.

16

Q

Then there's no way of knowing that that's

17
18

no& exactly what he intended,
A

Mo, that * s exactly correct. Now by statute

19

under the Social Security Administration and the V. A, Admin­

20

istration, the acknowledged child.

21

22

Now I'm not saying that this is not a hard case
factor. It is

But Chief Justice—

23

Q

What do you mean by that?

24

A

Well it means that, a man that came in and

25

acknowledged

his child and the child, the brothers and sisters

33

1

come in and inheirit before the child. This might be considered

a

by some to be a hard case factually»

3

4

Q

The acknowledgement

.did serve to make

her eligible to raeieve $100 a month—

A

That—

Q

9
10

Right, and that9s equivalent to $24,000 at

1 assume that parentsfrequently

distinguish

in the amounts that they leave to their children.
A

11

That is true, and in some cases, in some

12

states, Ism informed there9s no forced heirship. And the child

13

may be left just by testimony a mere pittance, where another

14

child may be—

15

Q

Or ommitted entirely.

18

A

Or ommitted entirely.

17

Q

As long as it's clear that the

18

wasn't an oversight.

19

A

20

Q

21

24
25

Yes, sir.
In almost all the states in this country

that's true, isn't it?
A

22
23

ommission

Yes sir, but in Louisiana, no, you cannot

do that.
Q

That's because of the point

A

Civil law-—
34

of the- —

1

Q

Civil law, isn't it?

z

A

You must leave the forced heirs with a

3

portion, and the forced heirs in Louisiana are lawful children

4

and parents.

5

As I say this may appear to some to be a hard case

0

factually. But I!d like to remind the Qourt of a speech made

7

by Chief Justice Burger, while then a United States Circuit

S

Court Judge, when he delivered an address at the conference of

9

judges in Columbus, Ohio, on September 4, 1968, from which the

10

following is an excerpt, and I think it is pertinent. This

11

copy was given me by Mr. Ben Miller from Baton Rouge.

12

The Chief vJusticesaid: "These hard cases usually come

13

to the Court with a narrow record of but one case which fre­

14

quently presents emotionally appealing situations that confuse?

15

and blur the bedrock consequences of a broad holding."

16

The address was published in the Ohio Bar, Volume

17

41, No. 46, dated November 25, 1968, pages 1440, and 1441.

18

Now in my opinion, Pandora6 s Box would be opened by any holding

19

that federal law, as declared by federal courts and not even

20

by Congress, and not by state law, would govern succession

21

rights in all of the 50 states, and overrule a states law on

22

inheiritance of property in that state.

23
24
25

Q

May I ask if the record shows how much a

state gets if there’s any left?
A

The record does show, and it's approximately
35

I

$15*000 in property, real estate»

Q

$15,000»

Yes, sir»

Q

13
14

Yes, Your Honor, the child would have had

Even thoughthere

had beentheacknowledge-

[sent?
A

'15

No. If there had been the acknowledgement,

16

the fathers estate would still have to support the child, that

17

is correct, Your Honor.

Q

18

And when is it that the fathers estate•is

19 not subject to child support?
A

20
21

the child can earn a living for himself,
Q

22
23

It supports the child anfcil he is 21, or if

why is it. in

this instance,wasn’t

there

an effort here to hatje the estate contribute tb this child's

24 support?
25

Q

The trial judge reasoned this vay: in the
36

1

divorce cases inLouisiana, in the jurisdiction where we are,

z

a child in a divorce case gets between 60 and 75 dollars a

3

month support» The trial judge felt that this child was re-

4

cieving $100 a month, suppprt, and that that was sufficient for

5

the childs support.

6

Q

1

A

No.

6

Q

The

9

A

The

But the statute itself doesn’t fix——
5
amount?
statute just says what is necessary

10

for the support of the child, and leaves it up to the discre­

II

tion of the Court.

12

Q

So even had

this pension, orwhatever

it

is, this $100 a month been only $50 a month, there might still

have been a Adding that the astate was not to pay anything?
A

Maybe, and it may have been just the op­

16

posite, that the estate should have had to contribute so much

17

money.

18

Considering some of the bedrodk, I mean some of the

19

anologies, to this case, and some of the bedrock consequences

20

which may, we may get into by a broad holding, and this case

a child. Some states permit that an unmarried man and an unmar- j
8
ried woman may adopt, others may say just an unmarried woman

25

may adopt.

most states permit a married couple to adopt

37

1

Some states may wish to deny inheiritance rights to

a

an adopted child , or some may want to give the adopted parents

3

of the child some rights in the ohilds estate„

4

But what would happen if a state

would suddenly de­

s

clare that they had changed their policy on the prospectiva, and

6

deny adopted children the inheiritahce rights? In real property

7

in the state?

8
9

If that is to be declared unconstitutional as discrim­
inatory against the innocent child, in some other hard case

10

who beleeved that he was the child of his parents, but later

II

it was decided that he was the adopted child. The child would

12

come out without anything.

13
14

Q

In this particular case, could this man

alone have adopted Smis child?

IS

A

There' s no—

16

Q

In Louisiana.

A

There's no prohibitions Sihat I know of that

24

as

he could not.
Q

And then he would be in the same category ofj

a ligitimate child.
A

Yes, sir.

Q

So that if an illigitiraate child is born to

a pauper who has no access to kegal adivce or adoption, there's
no way in the world for that child to become able to inheirit?
3

No, sir.

38

1

Tkat child is entitled to support—

Q

4

Well that means adopted.

Did you say if the child

No I said has to be adopted.

was adopted?

10

done by a Notarial Act. where you go to a Notary and you say

11

this is my child and I want him to be my heir and I want him

12

to inheirit from me. That is a ligitimation, it has to be

13

specific.

14

Q

15

A

And that's under Lousiiana law?
That8s under Lousiiana Law. Or the part is„

16

the mother and the father of-, .the child may marry. If they

17

marry either before or after the child is born, and consider the

18

child as their . child, the child id ligitimated by that act of

19

marriage.

20

Q

Z'i

A

That's before a Notary?
Nor just go into a church and get married.

22

And just have the child live in the home with them and acknowledge

23

it.
Q

24
25

Well I thought you said ligitimise it before

a Notary.

39

A

1

z

There are two ways of doing a ligitimizing.

One before a Notary and a document is signed, the other is by
*

3

action of the parties, by actually being married. And acknow­

4

ledging informally or in writing that the child is theirs»
Q

5

But this has to be done before a Notary

6

and in

Louisianathat's differant from Notaries in other countries

7

that's an official affair»

3

A

S

Q

Yes, sir»
But that's the only way to do it» The only

10

difference between that child, the child in this case,, the

11

only reason she can't inheirit is because her father

12

do that.

13

A

didn't

The father did not ligitimize her before

14

a Notary Public, and he did not marry the natural mother, or

IS

he did not, of course, leave a will, or adopt her,

16
1?

Q

And ritsne of these things, could hhe on her

own have done, obviously.

18

A

No.

19

Q

Mr. Leithead, under

thestatutes ofLouisian

20

would that certificate of Acknowledgement have been valid if

21

the mother had not also joined in it? Must both of them join

22

in the acknowledgement?

23
24
25

A

My understanding

is that they do.Both.

Or

if only the husband signs the acknowledgement, it is not binding
on the mother. It's only binding on those who actually acknowledge
40

1

it.

2

Q

I see.

3

A

I'm not quite sure, but I believe either

4

one can acknowledge. But it's only binding on the one who does.

5

Q

How much more would they have to say on

6

this Certificate inorder to confer rights ©f inheiritance, by

7

intestacy?

8

9

K

They would have had to have said that they

acknowledged, Ezra Vincent would have had t© say that he was

10

the father of this child and that he acknowledged the child as

11

his child and granted him the right, the fight to inheirit from

12

him. It has to be specific.

13

Q

Just—

14

A

It's like a will—

0

Just five more words.

A

Well, I;m just giving you those in my words,

15

Q

16

\7

it could be maybe less or more than five words, but he would

18

have had to express his intention, becuase 'this does not, in

19

itself, express his intention to allow the child to inheirit froir

20

him.

21

I might say another anology to this case, the Louisiana

22

Code prohibits divorced spouses from marrying his or her con"

23

eufoine. Now is a state to be denied this policy, becuase it might

24

be denying equalprotection under the Constitution?

25

I see my femme is running out. I'd like to—

41

1

Q

Doss Louisianaa have a common law marriage?

2

A

Louisiana does not recogaize common law

3

marriages although many states do.

4

Q

Yes .

A

Q

Has there been any question raised yet

about that being unconstitutional?

9

A

There's never been any question as to whethes

10

or nofcy no, sir„ that question has never been raised in Louis­

II

iana. Whether or not

12

of the state in its policy decisions, whether

13

14

living together should go through a ceremony. The question has

IS

just not risen.

that if the constitutional perrogative

1

or not not to
5

!©

But if it had arisn it would be obliterated by that

17

would that be constitutional for the state to apass such a

18

statute.

19

The implications of this case may be far reaching,,

20

far more reaching than the narrow issues that are presented

21

before this Court.

22

Once this Court decides that the Supreme Court of

23

the United States is going t© pass on the dissent and distri­

24

bution of laws!in the 50 stated, in my opinion, the Court

25

would have to legislate on many items and make decisions and
42

'

S

1

decide many points in succession law, which will be most com­

2

plicated .

3

For instance, in this particular, in Louisiana, these

4

are some 6£ the things that the Court would have to decide.

S

Whether an illigitimate child, whether the illigitimate child

6

would inheirit from its father equally with a Xigitimate child.

7

You see, this makes a difference becuase in Louisiana we have

8

a forced heirship. In some ©f the other common law states it may

9

not make any difference.
Will an adultress5 Illigitimate child inheirit the

10

11

same a-.i a

42

igitimate cipjd? Should there be a distinction there?

n

illigitimate child woo is not an adultress' ill­

Will an illigitimate child kho Is informally ack­

13
14

nowledged inheirit just as well as one that is formally ack­

15

nowledged?

18

Will there be a distinction made if the father had

17

an illigitimate child and later the mother and the father

18

married? Would that make any difference as to the rights of

19

inheiritahce?

20

Would the Illigitimate child of the father, of the

21

fathers" concubine inheirit his one half interest in the

22

community property of the father with his Xigitimate wife?

23

Williilligitimate children inheirit to the exclusion

24

of the decedents parents who are forced heirs, if there were

25

no other children? Or would the illligimate> child, no matter how

43

!

able to be acknowledged. , would he be considered a forced heir?

2

These are all many questions that would have to be

3

answered and the Court would be legislating* in my opinion, if

4

they would attempt to decide that the intestate laws

5

this Court for decision

b© affirmed.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

MR. COX: Thank you very much, Mr. Chief

We submit that the decision of the Court below should

6

7

.before

Justice Burger „
I think that at the outset I should answer the most

IS
16

important question raised by Mr. Leithead * and that was the

!7

question of the confusion that would result in property law

18

if this illegitimate child were considered to be a child of the

19

decedent.

20

The answer is that if this Court ruled as it has in

21

Levy and Glona that it's invidious t© discriminate against

22

illigitimates, and that this child should be treated as a ligi-

23

timafce slice the burden of proof standard has been met here,

24

then this child would simply inheirit like any other child, and

25

his relationships \yis a vis the parents, vis a vis collateral,

44

f

would be just like any other child. Thera would be rao uncertainty

2

in Louisiana0s property laws as a result of such a ruling»

3

It was cleared up in North Dakota by the North Dakota

4

Supreme Courts by stating that for all intents and purposes,

5

a child who has born the burden of prooving his parentage should

6

be treated as a ligitiraate.

1

Now 1 think of the other question, that is , the chaos

8

that might be Created in land titles—

On what ground did North Dakota base that

'

12

of Jensen based it on the grounds of the North Dakota Conztitutic n

and the United States Constitution, granting equal protection

14

15

Supreme Court of the state of Italy , under post war consti­

16

tution-

17

decided 'that in Italy, the equal protection of the laws under

i

tints of their status , the innocent victims of discrimination .

2

Levy and Glona are the laws of the land, and to repudiate Levy

3

and Glona because of the fact that land titled might h© involved

4

is to deny to a particular person, a particular case and con­

§

troversy, equal justice under the law»

Q

Now in the famous case of Muacrat vs. United States,

?

it was held that actual cases or controversies were the things

8

presented to the Court. Declaratory judgements about other

9

peoples rights would not be entered upon by this Court.

10

In U.S. V. Wade, and Gilbert v, California, the Court

11

ruled that the new standards which were basic standards of due

12

process in those cases, that is the right of an accused to have

13

a Counsel in the lineup where this reprejudiced his case, would

14

be applied to Wade and Gilbert, but not tio those who had lived

15

before Wade and Gilbert, or who had transgressed previously.

16

If this Court rules in favor of the little child in

17

this case, it w&ll apply to her case, and to subsequent cases.

18

And lawyers will have ample opportunity to make their wills and

19

provide under the laws for fch&ir clients.

20

But under Levy and Glona, this child is entitled t©

21

the most profound consideration of her equal protections rights

22

by this honorable Court.

23

Q

Mr. Coss, I live in Virginia, which permits

24

a testator to make a will, I think, any way he wihnts to do it,

25

he can cut off his children, I suppose that9s true in 49 other
46

1

states= Suppose 1 make a will, leaving nothing to my children,

2

if they have ,a claim becuase Louisiana, if they lived in Lou­

3

isiana, 1 could not have cut them off, that they are thereby

4

denied equal protection?

5

A

No, because, here we have a question of

6

a class of people, Your Honor, in this particular case we have

7

a class of people, illigitimates, just like a class of people,

8

Chinese, in which this honorable Court in cases have said that

9

in alien land-lost cases, that we couldn't discriminate against

10
11

them, either,,
Q

-““got a class. Suppose I had some children,

12

well, children in Louisiana can inheirit, the children in the

13

other spates can't?

14

A

1 see no --

15

Q

—equal protection problem there, at all?

16

A

I see no reason why children in one state

17

should not be able t© inheirit, and children in another state

18

according to the state11 a legislative wisdom can inheirit only

19

if their parents say that they can or cannot. But 1 do see

20

something invidious in one state saying, or any state saying,

2i

that Japanese, as was the case in Gyaraa vs„ California, that

22

the child of an alien cannot hold property foeuc&se it is pre­

23

sumed to be the aliens property <•

24
25

Add I would join with Justice Black, who wanted to
g© further, and say that not only could that child hold property

47

t

a
3

but his parents should be able to hold property.
This is a discrimination against a class of children,
Your Honor, not a state trying to carry out a state purpose.

Thank you, Mr. Cox, thank you, Mr. Leithead,

the case is submitted.
