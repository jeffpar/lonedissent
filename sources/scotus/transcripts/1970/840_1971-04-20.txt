ARGUMENT OF PAUL N. HALVONIK, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

9
10

MR. HALVONIKs

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and

Members of the Court:

31

Actually this case is quit® simple.

The principal

12

facts occur in the years 1950 to 1952.

13

lawfully entered the United States for the purpose of permanent

14

residency in the year 1950.
In the summer of that year he registered for the

15

18

The Petitioner here

draft.

E© was later that sunsaer drafted, but he did not submit

to inductioni he signed an exemption from military service asprovided by the 1948 Selective Service Law.

That exemption

19

provided that aliens who were permanent residents would be

20

ex©mpt<M from the draft if they executed the form.

21

the

22

Forces.

23

In exchange

would be relieved ©f liability for service in the Armed

The following year 1951, Congress amended the

24

draft law to provide that permanent resident aliens could b®

25

drafted, thus removing the ■ exemption part of the bargain in
2

I

favor of Petitioner.

2

a drastic departure from prior law.

3

aliens been drafted bythis country if they chose not to be.

4

As we pointed out in our brief, this was
Never before had neutral

Petitioner was drafted again.

This time he went

5

down to submit to induction but he was rejected because he didL

6

not — he was not physically fife for service.

7

The next significant date is 1952 when Congress

8

adopted Section 315 of the laanigration and Nationality Act, the

9

section which Petitioner contends controls here.

Section 15

10

provides what this Court has characterised as a two-pronged

11

test where an alien who has signedexemption from military

12

service is seeking citizenship.

13

the alien must have sought the exemption, and two: must have

14

been relieved from military service, prior to 1952 law which

15

required this exemption because the execution of the exemption

16

also grants relief from liability.

17

It provides that, one: that

But Congress, evidently because of the intervening
f

18

law, taking away this release from liability for anyone who

19

signed the exemption now provided that two events had to occur

20

and we contend that Petitioner was not relieved from liability

21

since he was drafted, and therefore, that he should be admitted

22

to citizenship.

23

The judgement, at least below, and I assume still

24

takes the position that had Petitioner actually served in the

25

Armed Forces he 'would be eligible for citizenship and we con ten

3

i

that that is a misreading of the statute; it says "liability

2

for military service,” not service in the Armed Forces; not

3

actual service.

4

have said so.

S

liability are eligible for citizenship and Petitioner was not

8

relieved from liability.

7

to make a distinction between those who were physically fit

3

and could act in the service and those who just weren't

3

physical.

If the Congress meant actual service it would
It merely said those who are not relieved from

Moreover, it wouldn't make much sense

The Congressional scheme makes a good deal of sense.
Mow, the Government in jits reply brief in this

10
11

case has raised a new argument that was not raised before and

12

that is that this section that has been the focus of all the

13

litigation up to now, Section 315, isn't applicable to the case

14

because —
But the Government contends that the savings

15
16

clause. Section 406(a) of the Immigration and Naturalization

17

Act keeps Petitioner's status the same as it was inthe year

18

that he signed the exemption.

19

with the argument.

20

Government's general position that if Petitioner had served he

21

would be eligible for citizenship, because the Section 315 of

22

the Act doesn't apply to people who signed the exemption before

23
24
25

There are a number of problems

First of all, it's inconsistent with the

1952.
q

Mr. Halvonik, the Government filed only brief in

this case?

That is correct*

You talked about a reply brief.

Their reply brief? right.

That's the

4

only brief they filed.

5

below but I just was referring to — they have filed only the

6

one brief and in the brief essentially relies on this point.

7

I want to emphasise that it does seem to be in­

They filed other briefs in the courts

8

consistent with their general theory that if he had served he'

S

would be eligible for citizenship because if that saving clause

10

saved all ©f the disabilities of everybody then it also saved

11

those who also had served in the Armed Forces and -thus Congress ,

12

in trying to create this new status in 1952 for people whom it

13

was drafting it would be unsuccessful.
Now? the inconsistency, I think, in the Govern­

14
15

ment's position points up, I think, their'misreading of Section

16

406(a) in relation to Section 315f because Section 315 is an

17

exception to the savings clause in 406(a).

18

meant to change status.

19

to change the series of events that result in ineligibility for

20

citizenship and add a new condition before one becomes in­

21

eligible.

22

Section 315 was

That9s whatit8s there fori

It's meant

That’s pra
That's precisely what it5s for and it . therefore

23

is a specific exemption to the savings clause.

5

It begins with

1

petition for naturalisations that are pending,
The Government takes the position that sines,

2
3

there is this notwithstanding Section 405(h) language ,

4

therefore Congress meant to leave Section 405(a! as a continuing

5

status quo in all of these cases.

6

with the case relied on by the Government in Shomberg.

7

Shomberg also started out with."notwithstanding Section 405(b)

8

9

this Court said: Well, it may well be that the draftsman could

that case Section 318 was designed specifically for this
problem, designed specifically for & change of status that it
was an exception to the savings clause.

19
20
21

22
23

25

And here all you need

to d© is look at the language of Section 316 tc see that it's
supposed to have retroactive effects.

The past tense refers

to those who have applied.in the past for exemption.
Moreoever, X think probably Section 315 doesn't

have that much prospective impacti £t9s main impact is retro­
spective.

There are very few people under the change in the

laws who could properly receive this exemption and then ever
be in a position to apply for eifciaenship or to apply for
permanent residence.

1 think Section 315 is perfectly designed

for cases such as that one here.

It's perfectly designed for

retrospective applications.
I wonc t dwell too much longer on Section 315.
6

We

i

have In our brief gone into some length eJbout the history

©f this exemption; about the history extending back to the

Civil War, telling aliens: you can either accept the burdens

©f citizenship or not and you make your decision and that 3s

6

ship and you won’t gat the benefits.

You will be released from the obligations of citizen­

7

What 315 is designed to do it to take care of

8

those people who did have the obligation imposed on them, the

9

citizen obligation of military service after they had signed,

10

the exemption.

11

in this case,

12
13

That’s also relevant to our second contention

We contend in the brief there that Petitioner

14

didn’t make a knowing waiver of his eligibility for citizennature
ship because he wasn’t apprised properly of the/of the bargain

15

he was making.

IS

it was held that though feh© alien had signed an exemption form

17

he would not be bound to it because he had been officially

18

told by both the United States Government and the Swiss

19

.Legation that it didn't really mean that he couldn’t become a

20

citizen and the 'Court here didn’t rely on estoppel theory;

21

they said there wasn’t a knowing waiver ©£ the eligibility,

22

because he wasn’t properly apprised of the consequences,

23

We rely there on the Moser ease.

In Moser

-Well, we say the same thing happened here, that,

24

he wasn’t .given any real choice because the choice was illusory

25

end h® wasn’t told really what was going to happen.

7

He, w©8

1

told: if you take this exemption you will receive this bene­

2

fit.

3
4

0

When you say he wasn't told what was

really going to happen# precisely what are you alluding to?

5

A

I'm alluding to the fact thathe was told

6

that he wouldn't ba able to become a citizen but h@ was also

7

told that he would be released from liability for service in

8

the armed forces and thus he made his choice# looking at these

9

two alternatives.

But# those alternatives# it turns out,

JO

weren't real.

11

release from liability.

12

He wasn't getting that; he wasn't getting that

Well# the Government said: Wall# it's just a

13

change in law and that sort of happens when you enter into a

14

bargain you have to perhaps anticipate that somebody will

15

change the law.

IS

private contract, but here the party he made the agreement

17

with was the Government# and it was that Government that told

13

him that he would not have to serve; he would be released from

19

liability for military service.

20

And that may ba a good argument where it's a

Well, then the Government, the very institution

21

with which he made the agreement went back on its promise.

22

Because the consideration was initially illusory and he was

23

not given a fair oppoertunity to make a choice between the

24

exemption and service.

25

I think it's significant in Moser where this was
8

1

referred to as a .rule of elementary fairness that the Court

2

cited Johnson v. United States, which is in 318 U. S. Report,

3

and what happened in Johnson is this s it was a matter of

4

during a criminal trial the defendant had taken the stand and

5

was testifying -'and than tried to invoke fha privilege against

self-incrimination and the judge permitted him to invoke that

that he ruled improperly; he shouldn't have allowed the defen­

good moral character and I assume that any man who malingered

or carae up with a fraudulent illness in order to avoid military

So, it was events that changed the bargain there.

15

Events on the outside that here would change the bargain was

18

Q

Had he — the second time around had he

I believe that's the case.

to ask the Government, but that has been the Government's

20

MR. STONE:

21

23

Thank you, Mr.

Halvonik.

17

22

But,

Mr. Chief Justice and may it. please

the Court:
The Government's view of this case raises

24

essentially two questions:

One, whether a Petitioner8®

25

eligibility for citizenship is, in fact, governed by the
19

i

;

1

Selective Service Act of 1948 or by the Immigration and

2

Nationality Act of 1952,

3

And 'feTO: assuming that the 1952 Act applies,

4

whether Petitioner is# nonetheless# ineligible for United

5

States citizenship now by virtue ©f his having applied for and

S

obtained an alien’s exemption from the draft in 1950»
I think both of these questions raise rather

7

3

difficult issues of statutory interpretation of the 1952 Act.

9

Without reiterating material that has already beengone over

10

or* that is familiar t© this Court I think it might foe helpful

11

right now if I very briefly place the 1952 statute in its

12

context»
Under the Selective Service Act of 1948 and under

13
14

the predecessor statute in 1940# the alien who applies for an

15

exemption from the draft on the grounds of alienage# was

16

thereby fundamentally permanently debarred from seeking

17

citizenship.

18

an alien's exemption shortly before his scheduled induction in

19

1950 and he passed the physical examination for the draft.

20

Thus# when Petitioner Astrup sought and obtained

Th© sole test inthe military service area of an

21

alien's eligibility for United States citizenship was# in

22

fact# whether that alien had committed a valid application

23

for an exemption on the grounds ©f alienage.

24
25

Mow# I take it that we're all agreed that if /the
1948 Act is &pplic?afo!e to this case Mr. Astrup is clearly

20

1

ineligible for citizenship and 1 guess there could be no dis­

2

pute on this point in view of this Court’s holding in Ceballos

3

v. Shaughnessy in which a unanimous Court in an opinion by

4

Mr. Justice Brennan held thatunder the 1948 Act an exempt alien

5

subsequently loses his exemption, but like the Petitioner here

6

fails to pass the physical examination, continues t© be in­

7

eligible for citizenship.

8
9

Late in. June of 19 51, as the Korean War grew in
intensity. Congress did what it had dona several times before

10

during wartime is put increasing pressure on aliens residing

11

inthe United States to participate in the war effort.

12

case of permanent resident aliens, such as Petitioner,

13

Congress simply amended the Selective Service Act of 1948 to

14

provide that permanent resident aliens were no longer l@lig.iblc

15

for draft exemptions on grounds of alienage.

16

affected both those aliens who had already sought and obtained

17

alienage exemptions and those who had not done so.

18

In the

And this law

Well, what about citizenship status of those

19

aliens wh© had, in fact; obtained alienage exemptions which

20

were no longer valid and who were now eligible theoretically,

21

at least with respect to their alienage, to be called t©

22

military service.

23

by no means necessary, for Congress to have provided in the

24

1951 Amendment that some sort of adjustment to the ineligibility

-25

for citizenship of those persons like Petitioner, who were no

It certainly would have been possible, but

21

1

longer exempt by virtue of that amendment.

2

any event, it would have been logical for Congress to have

3

said nothing one way or another in the 1950 statute directly

4

about 'She citizenship eligibility of those persons whose

5

eligibility had been taken away by that statute.

S

And I guess, in

But, Congress said nothing? that is, nothing more

7

than that p§Emaneat resident aliens were a© longer exempt by

8

virtu© ©f their alienage.

9

after that statute became effective then, for the at least

And 2 take it also that one day

10

year and a half until the effective date of

11

Immigration and Nationality ~ a© one doubted that the

12

Selective Service Act of 1948 continued to govern the citizen-!

13

ship eligibility of those persons like Petitioner and

14

then consequently, those who had applied

15

tions, continued to be debarred from seeking citizenship.

16

the 1952

for alienage exemp­

Then finally in 1952 Congress passed the

17

Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 which is the statute

18

that gives rise to the problems in this case, and which for

19

the first time, incorporated the rules governing citizenship

20

eligibility of aliens in a context other than the Selective

21

Service Act and citizenship eligibility an&cits relationship

22

to military service.

-

23
24
25

Now, as we know, the 1952 Act set out a somewhat
different test for citizenship eligibility.

In the words of

< .this Court In Ceballos v. Shaughnessy, a two-pronged test, and

i

1

that is the formulation that has been used aver since but it

2

has never been clearly elaborated what exactly that test meant,,

3

And by that two-pronged test aliens were debarred

4

from seeking citizenship if he both applied for an alien's

5

exemption and 15is or was relieved from service on such grounds»

6

Now, again* certainly it was possible for Congress

7

at that time to have settled the question of citizenship

3

eligibility for those whose exemptions had been removed from

9

the 1951 Amendment* by specifying that the two-pronged test

10
11

set out in the 1951 Act would be applied to those persons»
But* again Congress did not significantly at all

12

refer to that class of persons like Petitioner* who had applied

13

for alien's exemptions prior to the passage of the 1952 Act —

14

of the 1951 Amendment that took that exemption away.

15

what Congress did was to put a savings clause in the 1952 Act*

16

which is Section 405(a) of the Act* printed now as a note to

Q

Mr» Stone, what class of aliens would have

better title to take advantage of Section 315(a) under the
"or has applied" language?
A

I want to get to that* Mr» Justice White»

That is a somewhat difficult question to answer precisely if we

23

i

take the assumption that that applied or "has applied,” must

2

be parsed word for word, then it is difficult for me to think

3

of anyone who, at the time the 1952 Act was enacted, had

4

already applied, he would not come under the rule in this case«

it isn't necessarily so and in Ceballos v. Shaughnessy tills

under the Selective Service Act of 1948»

And*

It simply continues in

Now* this Court had held that the savings clause

8

we're dealing with here is a

very broad and inclusive clause

9

which is gotten around only with great difficulty,

Mr. Justice

10

Clark described Section 405(a) in the Menasche case in 348

11

US* in which this Court very carefully examined the history

12

of the savings clause as contained in the Immigration acts and

13

now I'm quoting 338 US 535s
“The consistent broadening of the savings

14
15

provision, particularly in its general terminology indicates

16

that tills policy of preservation was intended to apply to

17

matters both within and without the specific contemplation of

18

Congress.

19

quite clearly that the savings clause of Section 405(a) is

20

inapplicable unless Congress makes a deliberate and specific

21

statement of its intentions to eliminate its preexisting

22

liability.”

fact that we make actual service as the test.

service a test and the fact that the physical exam comes into

for this is that the langiiaga of the '48 act seems to make it

could have chosen to adopt this more generous provision and to

really do have t© take into account whether Congress —
Section 315 is not.* after all, crystal clear as to whether
Congress intended to hold all aliens to their end of this socalled "bargain arrangement” sort of like a contract.

5

I don’t think that really that the harshness of

our interpretation of Section 315 such as it is* would apply

7

to a case where an alien had passed his physical examination

originally and only decided to choose his alien's exemption

after the fact of knowing that ha was physically fit for the

draft.
In fact* several Courts of Appeals have made

12

related arguments and every Court of Appeals that has decided

13

this precise issue has* in fact* decided in the Government’s

14

favor and several have pointed out in connection with tills

issue that many things can take — happen.

16

An alien can assess his chances of getting an

17

exemption on some other ground that would not debar him from

18

citizenship before he chooses to claim his alien’s exemption

19

and then he may later lose his exemption but in the interim

With respect to this Petitioner? even though this

Court were to take? let's say? an intermediate position with

respect to Section 315, that the alien doesn’t have to have

In any ©vent, we, on Ibaleae© feel that the language

in Section 31S is quite badly strained by construction that his

relief from alienage must rest exclusively on grounds of

We feel that a more normal reading of that language

We think that this reading is far mors in line

21

with Congress's attitude, as expressed in the prior legislation

and we think that the prior legislation, the basic concepts

of that legislation were meant to be retained in the 1952 Act.

It is for that reason that wa ask that this Court
