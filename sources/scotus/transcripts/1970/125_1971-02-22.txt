This case which, is here on a writ of certiorari

Circuit, raises a fundamental question as to the legal status

of taxes which an employer withholds from the wages of his

employees.

And, specifically, the ease raises the proper

The facts of the case

re relatively simple.

Halo Metal Products, Inc. filed a p :tifeio:.i for an arrangement
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy

;.ct, and that is the pro­

vision which allows operation of the business to try to stall
off the bankruptcy and was allowed by the Referee of the
Bankruptcy Court to remain in the possession of the business
and to carry on the business’s operation, subject to the
Referee's supervision during the Chapter 11 arrangement.
As is the custom in such an arrangement, the
Referee entered an elaborate order requiring the debtor in

2

possession to file periodic reports and to maintain full

s

records of its operation during the arrangement period.

3

in addition, the Referee ordered the debtor to open up three

4

bank accounts.

5

all revenues received by the business during the operation in

6

the arrangement period.

7

periodically from the funds deposited in the revenues account

B

the amount necessary to pay all employee wages and disburse­

9

ments from this payroll account were to be made at proper in­

10

And

The first of these accounts was to receive

And the second account was to receive

tervals with the approval of the Referee.
The Referee ordered that simultaneously with

11

12

meeting the debtor in possession's payroll obligation that the

13

debtor deposit into a third special account the amount of tax

U

and social security deductions that the debtor was required to
withhold from his employees

15

wages.

And withdrawals from this

.

16

third account were to be allowed only for payment of the-’ *•

il­

withheld taxes and welfare benefits as those payments becamef

ls

due to the United States Government.

19

The debtor failed almost entirely 'to.comply with

20

the Referee's orders, with the orders of the Bankruptcy Court

21

with respect to these withheld t&xea? although the income and

22

social security taxes were withheld from the employee wages ,

23

the withheld funds were not' placed .in a special account nor

2«

were they paid over to the united States at the proper time,

25

as required by the arrangement court.
3

1

During the arrangement: the United States filed

2

a proof of claim for $1,075., that in one thousand, seventy-five

3

dollars of PICA and income taxes withheld from employees'

4

salaries on the ground that this amount was a special trust

S

for the United .States benefit under Section 7501A of the

8

Internal Revenue Cods of 1954 and about that section I shall

7

elaborate shortly.

0
9

Subsequently, about three months after the filing
of the original arrangement petition, Halo was adjudicated a

10

bankrupt.

11

States filed a petition in the bankruptcy proceeding, asking’

12

that the withhold taxes which it claimed ns a trust fund under

IS

Section 7501 be paid over tc. the United S-ir.at.es, just as any

14

trust fund would be paid over prior to payment of the costs

IS

and expenses of administration of the bankruptcy proceeding.

16

And the Referee denied the Government8 s petition

And a month latex, on December 22, 1967, the United

n

and 'the District Court and the Court of Appeals upheld the

18

Referee’s denial of the petition and it in that on which we are

19

here on a writ of certiorari to contest now.

20

Both of these courts It - Id essentially that Halo13

2!

obligation to pay over to the Government the taxes withheld

22

from employee wages was merely an & ministrative expense of the

2S

bankrupt estate and was thereby subject to the scale of

24

priorities established by Section 64 of the Bankruptcy Act of

25

which I- am sure this Court is quite familiar.

4

Now,, I -think it would be helpful to view the

i
2

issue presented here, which is whether the Government is en­

3

titled to recognition of a trust fund for the amount of taxes

4

withheld from the salaries of the bankrupt's employees during

5

the arrangement period as breaking dawn, essentially, into two

6

partsi two questions.

7

The first question is, and this is really the

8

question as construed by the lourt of Appeals; whether the

9

trust fund concept is simply inapplicable altogether, as both

10

16
17
18
19

20

2?
22
23
24
25

courts below seem to have felt, in a bankruptcy proceeding.
And the second question, which neither court reached, but which
I believe was the focus of the Bankruptcy Referee's decision,
is whether, assuming -chat the trust hoes not disappear merely
by virtue ©i the withholding employe.:;bankruptcy, but whether
the trust is nonetheless, defeated or enjoined if the trust is
defeated by virtue of the Government's inability to trace the
res of the trust, and I will Address myself to both of these
questions.
Q

As the Government looks at this case it

really is not a matter of priority, sit all.
A
Q

That's right, Mr* Justice

Stewart.

And by contrast, the way these courts lock

at it, that's all it was.
A

That"s right.

Q

Am I correct in that?
5

A

That's exactly right, and prior to several

years ago, I believe in 1955 when the Third Circuit decided
the Connecticut Motor Lines case, every court that had looked
into this and all the commentators, ;s I shall show shortly,
viewed the question as not one of priorities, but simply a
recognition of a trust, and not the matter of relative priorities „
Q

And then -the ques tion becomes s did the

trust to be —
A

Yes; is it —

Q

— it stead because the res —

A

Exactly; exactly; that is precisely what

1 think is important to show.

And what we are really alammed

about in this decision is the fact that the Court of Appeals
viewed these trust assets as debts and viewed this case as a
matter of -priorities between conflicting administrators.
Q

Yes.

A

Now —

Q

Well, it is apparently 3/our theory that the

bankrupt estate is really enjoying a windfall if it prevails
here; is it not?
A

That's right, Mr, Justice Blackmun, though

it is hard to trace, as I intend to

'.iscuss at length, it is

hard to trace precisely what, happened to the funds., one likely,
logical assumption is that this trust fund has simply been added

6

to the amount of assets available for the collection of the
bankrupt's creditors.

And therefore, collectioris from those

•

assets would be windfalls to those creditors„
Q
in

But the trust fund you are talking about

case of this kind is a fund that arises from the

bankrupt's assets themselves — from the bankrupt’s own assets?
A
Q

That’s

r:.ghfc

It's" jtrr: something that —‘ he paid wages

but he wrote checks for his employees for an amount less than
what they were getting paid ■—
A

That's

right

—*

Q

-- and

so hejust kept,

the rest.

And so

there has never been a transfer creation of the trust fund?
A

No? it was ordered by the Referee that the

Trustee make a transfer at the time he paid all the wages
in fact he never dido

And one of the points which I plan to

address myself to is whether the enjoinmer.t of the trust ought
to be defeated by the fact that the Trustee never did make
these deposits and so that a!.l we are really talking about is
whether a trust ought to be Imposed on general assets of the
bankrupt estate0

That is the question in this case, as we

view it.
But that is not the question as the Court of
Appeals viewed it and I think it is very important to see
exactly how the Court of Appeals did identify this question and

7

to make sure that what I consider the gross misconception in
the Court of Appeals opinion be corrected.
Q

Well, on your theory this statute, along

with the order of the Court, impress ;s a constructive trust
on the total receipts of the bankrupt and regards him as having
done what he had been ordered to do? is that substantially —
A
Mr. Chief Justice.

That9s exactly right; that's exactly right,
That is our theory.

And that is the theory

of Professor Scott, and that is the theory of all the courts
which have directed themselves to this aspect of the case and
the theory that the courts have gone on and since we have
gotten into this X might as well anticipate what I expected to
be a later statement of the argument: the theory that these
courts have gone upon is than yes, in a situation where the
res of a trust cannot be traced, where you. are simply talking
about general assets, is that you rvn a risk in either imposing
the trust or disregarding the trust, you run a risk that the
actual proceeds have been lost in the accounting procedure;
there is no record to say where the assets went and so that
either the beneficiary of the trust or the. general creditors
may have suffered in some way.
Now, it seems to me the most likely assumption is
.

that the estate has been fattened by the failure to pay over
these funds at the designated time and though we want to pro­
tect the creditors with respect to the general assets of the
8

1

estate, it has been the view of all the courts that have con­

z

sidered this that because of the fact that the Referee, the

3

debtor in possession is himself an officer of the Bankruptcy

4

Court and because the debtor in possession is the person who,

3

by his negligence, failed to segregate these funds and failed

6

to set up -the trust for the benefit >f the Government, that we

1

ought not to make the beneficiary of the trust suffer because

B

of the negligence of an officer of t.ie bankruptcy court»

9

ought to give that beneficiary the right to rely on the fact

10

We

that an officer of the bankruptcy court is g>ing to do what the

11

bankruptcy court tells him feu, particularly when the bankruptcy

12

court states in the order that it shall supervise all these

operations on a weekly and monthly basis»
■So that all who have considered this question have
felt that the equitable consrderations which militate in favor
of recognizing

this right to rely on the bankruptcy court

doing what it says it's going* to do, should eliminate the re­
quirement of tracing the res of trust»
But, what I want also to make clear is that this
is not the ground — this issue which I consider to be the
crucial issue in this case is not the issue that the courts
below went upon»

The courts below, in ray opinion, fundamen­

tally misconstrued the whole nature of withheld taxes and the
interrelation of the Bankruptcy Act with this trust fund»
Q

I want to test your argument with a

I, at the moment, can find no argument against the proposition

I would not

want to go on record as committing the Government to that
position, but it seems to me that if you can trace the res of
the trust then you — then the Government ought to be required
to go after that trace of the res and the persons clearly
responsible for the waste of the re

Welly the point is there is nothing in the

A

Mo; it's a trust to the Government.

Q

A

Only for the Government.

How, that

trust

is set forth in Section 7501 of the Internal Revenue Code,
which is quoted in page 26 of our brief and to which I refer
the Court, and that provision state.: as follows:
"Whenever any person is required to collect or
t

withhold any internal revenue tax from any other person and to

11

pay over such tax to the United States, the amount of tax so

2 1

collected or withheld shall ta held to be a special fund in

8 j
,1

trust for the United States»'
Now, I take it that neicehr Respondent nor the
courts below would dispute that by virtue of Section 7501 an
employer who withholds income and social security taxes front

7 i

his employees' salary is the trustee of a crust, at least up

8

until the point that the employer be tornes insolvent»

j;

Now, let us

9

consider the case of the employer's

10

insolvency and look briefly at Section 64 of the Bankruptcy

11

Act, which is set forth in re levant part ah page 23 of our

12

brief.

13

establishes 'those debts of the bankrupt which have priority

14 ,

over general unsecured creditors of :he bankruptcy proceeding.

15 jj

That section, entitled: Debts which have priority,

And that section reads as follows:

19 i

cost and expenses of administration* including the actual and

18

2© I

And then follows a general enumeration

22 j

of expenses considered to be administrative expenses of the

23 |

bankrupt estate, followed by four other categories of debts

24 |

which have priority.
And I note-': in chat regard, just for the sake of

vision?

As; far as

re can tell the Senate

Report and the HouseReport are both rather limited, in terms of
explaining the purpose, but as far as we can tell the trust
imposed in Section 7501 was designed to forestall the possi­
bility that courts would limit the Government to mere debt
collection procedures and would not allow either trust collec­
tion or tax collection extraordinary procedures against those
withheld funds.

It is imperative to the structure of the

Social Security Act and to the withholding of income taxes?
yes, it is, Mr. Chief Justice.
Our view is that the entire legislative scheme

14
15

Welly in your view, if ne t the trust

which we discussed at length at pages 7 to 10 of our brief,
the entire legislative scheme behind the withholding of all
taxes shows that the Government serves merely as a collection
agent with respect to these :axes, that these are tax debts of
the employee to the Government and not of -the employer to the
Government.

And therefore, that these are neither taxes nor

debts of the bankrupt to the Government, and therefore
don’t come under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act which
establish priorities for debts and expenses of the bankrupt
estate.
Essentially, if an employee is paid $100 in wages j

25

15

receives $85 and he is considered to have discharged, the $15
tax liability and the employer at that point merely holds

,

as

the Tenth Circuit recently said, holds as a collection agent
for 'the Government.

He holds it for a brief period of time

and is required to pay it ovor.
And it’s my submission to this Court that regard­
less of how strong a policy Section 64 of the Bankruptcy Act
embodies as to the administrative priorities of administrative
expenses, there is nothing in that provision which converts trust funds into administrative expenses or which deals in any
way with the bankrupt's obligation to hand, over funds which it
has received in the capacity of collectior agent and neither of
the courts below nor the Respondent Trustee have attempted to
answer what I consider to be a crucial threshold question of
interplay at all does Section 64 have on these funds»
Q

Do you think the Nicholas case bears on

our problem here?
A
be discussed.

Yes.

1 uhink that it certainly needs to

Of course, this Court reserved in Nicholas the

question before us here.

Nicholas involved the question of

whether interest on withheld taxes accrued past the period of
bankruptcy or whether it stops with the institution of bank­
ruptcy proceedings or actual institution of bankruptcy.
.And the Court in Nicholas held that interest did
not accrue.

It held on the broad general principle that
16

Interest during the bankrupt-sy proceeding ought not to accrue
at all because it eats' away it creditors5 assets and creditors
ought not be disadvantaged merely because of delays attribu­
table to the long length of the bankruptcy proceeding,

What's

the relevant position of the Government, vis-a-vis for its

A

I don't know the answer to that question,

Mr, Justice White, except that I believe that if the lien Is
perfected that they stand ahead of all unsecured obligations,
including admini&rtive expenses, but I'm-not sure about the
answer to that.
I want to point out that the Court in the Nicholas
17

f

case, cited the second sentence of Section. 7501, and I think

z

it is. important, since no doubt the Nicholas ease does have to

3

be examined to determine the outcome of this case.

The second

sentence of Section 7501 after the trust is declared, says as
follows 5
"The withheld taxes shall be assessed, collected

6
7

and paid in the same manner <md subject to the same provisions

8 i

and limitations, including penalties, are applicable with ■

9 !

respect to the taxes from which such funds arose."

to !

Now, we think, as we discussed in our brief, that

St :
I

the legislative history of that statute makes it clear that it

12 I

was designed really — though it says "limitations," it was not

13

designed to limit remedies but to .expand Government remedies.
But, even with — even the quoted language taken at its face

14

!

value is# I think, if anything, favorable to our position in

15

this case, because the phrase "taxes from which such funds

1.6

17 i

arose" clearly refers to the income and social security -tastes
owed by the employees and withheld by the employer and these

18
t& I

taxes on the employees -would not be subject to any collection

4

limitations by virtue of the employer’s bankruptcy.

Now, they would foe subject, in any bankruptcy

Q

Off the track.

A

The Governmentseems

to be relying rather

heavily upon the trust fund theory and of the theory of trusts
and trusts ex nslifici©!-;

and I question why the Seventh

Circuit Court did not* address itself to this.

And 1 think it's

very obvious that- the reason why the Seventh Circuit. Court di.d
not address itself to this particular argument to the Govern­
ment is that it wasn't necessary for it to do so, because the

24

.i

court, there interpreted Section 64a to the Connecticut General

2

case did and the same as the Green case did: that number one*

3

they were not in conflict with one another; that Section 750XA

4

and 64a(1) could be read separately and by the second sentence

5

of 7501A it. provided that tir e trust would have the same limita­

8

tions on it as the taxes from which the fund arose and then

7

went on to say that the taxes arose from and by virtue of the

0

Bankruptcy Act and therefore the Bankruptcy Act would prevail

0

and ergo Section 64a.

10

.

. '

But* further* if this were not the case* that the

11

strong policy of 64a of the Bankruptcy Act would prevail ovei

12

the general provisions and the general policy of Section 7503 ,

13

I would like to review rather briefly the history

14

of these cases and starting out with the Guarantee Title Company

is

case, an opinion in 1912 where Section 34C>6 of the Internal

18
17
18
19

20
21

Revenue Code provided for a priority, as opposed to 7501 which'
provides for a trust fundo
There the Supreme Court held' that it was a beneficient policy that 64a should prevail, especially and in that
■
case it pertained to wage earners o' This was reaffirmed by this
Court in Davis versus Pringle .in 1925. ■
Bow, this line of cases goes undisturbed up until
the time of 0» S. versus Nicholas or Nicholas versus 0. Sc which
was decided in this Court in 1964.

'The problem arises with the

line of cases under City of New York versus Rassner»

25

And in the;

Rassner case the first case in 1942 in which this trust fund
was found to apply.

The Rassner case provided — the Rassner

case said that it was a general provision of the Bankrupcty
Act. in Section 64a, as pppcsed to the specific provisions of
the trust and the RasSner case went on to say that if it could
be shown that the policy or if the provisions of 64a were other
than general then the result would be different.
And this Court has shown in Nicholas versus the
United States, in express language said that it is a strong
policy thatprevails in 64a.

That being the case, then the

props fall from underneath the Rassner case aid all of the cases
that follow it fall like dominoes.
This is the theory of -the trustee.

This has been

the position of the Trustee from the very inception of this
case.
In the Nicholas case the Court went so far as to
say that the taxes that were incurred during Chapter 11,.and
this is precisely what we ara talking about here, "come within
the first priorities of Section 64 of the Bankruptcy Act. 5
That is the costs of administration.
The history of the administrative and cost of
administration provisions of the Bankrtupcy Act have constantly
worked towards allowance of cost of administration and
from tax collecting.

When you trace the history in the Bank­

ruptcy Act as•enacted in 1800 and 1841, 186? and 1898, all gave

1

top priority to taxes-

2

were change, the cost of administration was advanced and the

It wasn't until 1926 that the priorities

taxes were reduced to a sixth priority4

Then, under the Chandler Act of 1938, the system

5 i

of priorities was retained end further the tax collector was

6

further restricted by being required to file his claim within

7

the limitations set on all ether clmiras.

8

the act was again amended tc give further priority to costs of

9

administration by providing that costs of administration in a

And again, in 1952

'10

superceding bankruptcy takes priority over the costs of ad­

.11

ministration in the superceded Chapter proceeding, further

!2

strengthening the position of costs of administrationAnd lastly, the 1966 the most recent amendment,

13
14

which changed the priorities further or limited further the

'

15

claims for taxes by holding that fch

16

claimed for a three-year period prior to the filing of the

17

bankruptcy.
So, we see here historically this picture of the

18
19

taxes could only be

!

reducing of the tax claims and advancing the costs of admini­

20

stration and I think as the court,

21

scholarly opinion by Mr, Justice Has;tings, points out and

22

refers to the Congressional, rather the Senate Reports and the

23

House Conference Reports as it applied to c he costs of ad­

24.

ministration and the need to preserve these costs of administra­

25

tion because, let's take just what could happen very easily in
21

,

below, in the very

!

this case.
The Government is onl^ seeking to impress the

2
3

trust on thosetaxes that were collected by the debtor in

4

possession, but if you were to read Section 7501 it says ”any

5

person who collects taxes.."

6

rupt prior to filing.
Further, in following the Ressner line of cases

1
8
9
10

n
12

That, would also mean, the bank”

if you have every state and every municipality enacting trust
fund legislation there is nothing left to administer in these
cases.

Or, worse still, you have a trustee who is going to

■wait and see if anyone is going to assert his trust rights and
the. estate is- going, to go m .administered during this period
.

13

of time.
And, as the House Repo rts and the House Conference

14

15
16

Reports and the Senate Repos t, I- be ..ieve it was in the 82nd
Congress, emphasize the necessity to protect- the- trustee in
order to have orderly administration of the estate.

If you

1.7

18

IS
20

don’t protect the trustee, if you don’t give him-the first
priority, then you are not going to have orderly' administration
of estates.
Addressing the normal routine that's'employed by

21

22
23
24
25

the Trustee? first of all, he seizes the property in order to
protect it.

In so doing he immediately incurs liabilities.

He’s got to post a bond as required by court? he's got to assume
rent liabilities for use and occupancy; he’s got to employ
28

inventory clerks? he has got to employ a closer (?) by rale of

These are all obligations that he, himself, must take»

MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Stone, you have

four minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY RICHARD B. STONE, OFFICE
OF THE SOLICITOR GENERAL
ON BEHALF OS’ PETITIONER

38

5.

MR. STONE-s
Chief Justice.»

Yen'.

I'll just take a minute, Mr»

I want to clarify cue point.

I have been informed by my co-counsel that, as
to the Government lien on these taxes, if it is on real
property it is — comes ahead of administrative expenses? if
it's on personal property reduced, to possession' then it coraes
ahead, but if it is on personal property not reduced to
possession it comes behind preferred expenses»

However, a lien

in a Chapter 11 proceeding cannot be perfected against the
Trustee in any circumstances »

The Government is —’

Q

It doesn't need it because —

A

It doesrafe need it because it has trust

Q

Or you can say it doesn't need it because

fund anyway»

of its administrative expenses?
A

That, I suppose, is an undesirable, but

albeit an alternative —
Q

How about this bank account?

A

Oh, Mr» Justice Brennan, there is some

reference — tbereis a report filed after the institution of
•— the actual liquidation had occurred, which refers to a
special account in the bank, special tax account, but the
Referee specifically found, and I guess this is the facts for
the purposes of tills case that no such monies had, in fact,
been entered»

And it's unclear from the little record that we

39

1

■have , about the $200 or $300, that it was in fact a special

2

Government account and I would say that for purposes of this

3

case we have to assume that- we are going simply at the general

4

funds of the estate in imposing trust with respect to those

5

funds o

6

I want to say in conclusion only that I think that

7

Respondent's argument in this ease merely affirms my prior

0

staten®nt that neither the courts below nor'the Respondents

9

have- dealt with the issue of what is the nature of these debts s

10

are they tax debts of the employer owed to the Government or

n

does the- employer hold them merely as collecting agent for

m

debts of the employee»

13
14

I don't see on the theory that either the court
below or Respondent has gone on, how they would recognize this
\

15

trust fund, even if the proper amounts had bean segregated.

16

It seems to me. that under their theory which precludes operation

17

under 7501 trusts when a bankruptcy proceeding starts, the

18

trustee.would not have been authorised to pay over segregated

19

funds even if he had segregated them because they are simply

20

— would be no trust in’ a time of bankruptcy and that is a

21

totally unacceptable holding, "from our point of view»

22

\

Q

What do yon say about 7501 insofar as it

23

says taxes withheld by Idle employer shall be collected by the

24

same procedures as other taxes?

25

A

We have dealt with that at length in our

40

!

brief, Mr. Justice White.

Briefly to reiterate, we say first

2

of all that the legislative history shows that the real pur­

3

pose of that second sentence was to make sure that it would be

4

clear thattax: remedies were available altogether to the

5

Government.

6

absent that ordinary tax remedies would not be available

7

precisely because this was not a tax debt of the bankrupt .and

8

the Congress wanted all available procedural remedies % trusts

9

and —

There was a fear on the par'; of Government that,

10

Q

This was cumulative, not —

n

A

Right? right.

3ut 'even if it is viewed as

<

m

restrictive and 1 suppose it must be said that the Nicholas

is

Court and. I believe the Court went perhaps? farther than it had

u
IF;
1€

13

As 'an alternative ground the Nicholas.? court invoke! the
sentence to the proposition that interest couldn't be supported
during -this time.

To the extend that it is limiting I believe

that this case is distinguishable, because even though interest

U

would have been precluded on any tax debt, including the

!!

employees' tax debt in a bankruptcy proceeding, the employee»'
tax debts would have, at nc time been subjected to the collec­
ting limitation of being placed in the bankrupt employer's
estate and his funds available for general creditors.
