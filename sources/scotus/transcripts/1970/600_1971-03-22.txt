ORAL ARGUMENT BY ALBERT J. KRIEGER, ESQ.

We will hear arguments

MR. KRIEGER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
In considering the constitutionality of Title II

II

of the Consumer Study Protection Act? or as is popularly

12

called: The Federal Anti-lean-sharking statute.

We respectfully submit that the real question
posed is whether Congress may constitutionally enact a general
extortion statute.

Because, in truth and in fact, the statute

enacted by Congress does not reach in the true sense, the crime
of loan sharking, if we follow the definition of that crime,
as testified to at the hearings before Congress, is a lending
at a usurious rate of interest.
This statute does not i.nclude anywhere within it
those activities as a criminal offense.

That which it makes

criminal is extortion and extortion of the broadest stripe
covering a myriad extortional activi.ties to which criminals
may resort in our very society.
Even though the statute; continually refers to 'die
2

1

term, the phrases "Extension of credit," extension of credit

2

as defined by the statute refers not. merely to a debt but to a

Oo

claim, be that claim valid or .invalid, acknowledged or not,

4

disputed or not, however arising, so long as the satisfaction

5

of that claim is deferred.

6

The hearings before Congress certainly disclosed

7

and it may well be assumed that organized crime is interstate

8

in character and that organized crime may have, as one of

9

their substantial sources of revenue, loan sharking; that is

io

the lending of money at usurious rates of interest.

I3ut there

5?

is nothing within the proceedings had before Congress which

'12

would warrant

13

per se, is a crime which belongs in the Federal lexicon.

the broad and sweeping finding that extortion

14

The types of expression covered here may well

15

include the incidental extortion to which a loan shark may

16

resort in seeking collection of a debt ■— of a lending.

17

xaay also include an irate wage-earner going to his employer

18
1©

and demanding wages.

It

It may include an irate motorist after

a collision, saying to another driver:

You will pay me for

20

this damage, one way or the other, and by the end of the week.

21

These are all included within what we contend is any reason­

22

able reading of the definition "extension of credit.®

23
24

25

Certainly, and we concede there are times when
extortionate means are employed by loan sharks«

But what

Congress has done here is because organized crime may be well

3

1

involved in loan sharking and loan sharking at some time may

2

involve extortion, but all extortion, regardless of how it
arises, becomes a Federal offensee
We respectfully submit that such a statute is a

4
5

classic case of overkill.

Certainly Congress may legislate

6

against the crime of extortion; Congress has done so in 1951

7

and 1952, the Travel Act.

S

eludes as a Federal offense in extortion so long as that ex­

9

tortion may reasonably be connected with a Federal interest.

Congress may broaden what it in-

10

The Federal interest, however, between extortion generally —

11

extortion generally, appears.to be lacking.

12

connection to extortion generally appears to be lacking.
Certainly it did not appear within the hearings,

13
14
15

18
17
18
19

20
21

22

The hearings were directed at a specific definable class of
activity.

25

Congress, in seeking to legislate against an

organized crime activity, enacted this statute, and Congress
stated that the purpose of this statute is to s-trike at the
second-most lucrative source of revenue for organized crime;
loan sharking.

There is nothing within the proceedings before

Congress -which characterized extortion as a uniquely organized
crime activity or that extortion, per se, is a lucrative
source of funds for organized crime,.
The Federal peg for the general extortion statute

23
24

The Federal

is lacking.

There is no definable class of activity or acti­

vities whose vary nature might compel the finding of the

4

'1

Federal interest a la the current gambling statute.

2

Congress, instead of making all gambling illegal, said

3

gambling of a certain type has characteristics which compel

4

the finding of a Federal interest.

S

the gambling activity; it must involve five or more people,

6

dealing in amounts in excess of $2,000 on a daily rate, an

7

activity which is continued for 30 days or more.

8

the gambling activity fee the business of the individual.

9

Where

Such as: it must involve

And that

Here, if I may say "occasional extortioner",

10

finds himself fully within the purview of this statute even

11

if his activity is totally unrelated to loan sharking, the

12

vice which Congress was seeking to control.

13

It is our contention that the means that Congress

14

has selected to control laon sharking, these means are far too

IS

broad, far too inclusive and exceed the authority of Congress,

IS

both under the Interstate Commerce Clause and under the

17
18

Bankruptcy Clause.
We believe and we do not argue here that every

19

specific criminal statute requires a recitation that there

20

must be proved to a jury an interestate activity or that an

21

22
23
24
25

interstate facility was used.

We do believe, however, that in

a criminal statute there must be a showing at the trial level
if not of the interstate activity itself, or the use of the
interstate facility, but such a state of facts as warrants
the conclusion that the Federal interest is involved.
5

1

Q

What are the underlying facts of this case?

2

A

The underlying facts in this case, Mr»

3

Justice Harlan, are that in a local butcher store in Brooklyn

4

Mr» Miranda was — Mr, Miranda was the owner of a local

5

butcher store in Brooklyn; that he needed some money and was

6

not able to obtain money through the usual sources, and

1

through a friend was introduced to the Petitioner,

8

Petitioner loaned him some money at a usurious rate of in­

9

terest.

The

Eventually Mr. Miranda was unable to repay? a

10

new loan was worked out; again at a usurious rate of interest.

11

12

Mr. Miranda was again unable to pay and finally extortionist

13

threats were made to Mr, Miranda as an attempt to effect re­

14

payment .

.

13

There were no interstate facilities used.

This

16

all involved a transaction occurring in Brooklyn, New York,

17

in the Williamsburg section.

13

Q

But it is conceded that run-of-the-mill

19

extortion was exercised?

20

from your statement just now this is conceded?

21

22
23
24
25

A

Ar-d threats were made.

Oh, yes, Your Honor; there was

I talce it

extortion

under the proof in this case; there was.
But we feel that the fact of extortion in this
case still doss not make the extortion as committed by the
defendant here a Federal offense.
6

The only way this extortion

1

could become a Federal offense is if a general extortion

2

statute were part of our Federal criminal code.

3

basically what the Consumer Credit 'Protection Act is.

And that is

If the intent of Congress were carried out —-

4
5

if the intent of Congress were carried out it is perhaps quite

6

possible that Mr» Perez’s activities would fall within a

7

loan sharking definition that would be constitutionally accep­

8

table, but we are dealing not with such a statute»

9

we're dealing with a general extortion statute, and regardless

10

of the constant reference to this statute

n

statute, its basic nature was not changed.

I repeat;

as a loan sharking

The Congress, in the proposed new Federal

12

'

13

Criminal Code, treated the loan sharking statute anew and here

14

they face up to the problem, because; there was a recognition

15

in the commentary that such jurisdiction, referring to this

'56

17

plenary jurisdiction over extortionary activity may well be
overbroad.

And they recognized also, apparently, that this

18

statute, the current statute was an extortion statute.

19

they rewrote —
Q

20

And

What's the constitutional difference betweer

21

a loan sharking statute, as you call, it, which I take it you

22

say would be all right, or might be all right under this

23
24
25

statute?
A

I would say that the constitutional dif­

ference here is that this statute, just generally was an
7

?

enormous vacuum cleaner type effect, sweeps in every type of

2

extortionist activity, be it intrastate, be it interstate,

3

be it connected with a Federal interest, be it not connected

4

with a Federal interest.
A loan sharking statute, such as the one that

5
e

appears in Section 1771 of the proposed code, defines a class

7

of activity, thereby limiting the scope of the statute.

8

legislates against loan sharking as a business; it implants

©

definitions of the business, the character of the business &nd

It

10

the nature of the business connects it with organized crime

n

activity so that the casual lender, just as the casual gambler

.12

is omitted from the impact of Federal jurisdiction.

13 |
14

'

I

I think that we are basically dealing, sir, with
matters of definition: how far out may Congress reach in
legislating against what might well be an interstate evil.

15

16

This is basically, I submit, a matter of the scope.

17

true that extortion within the loan shark gambling, may be

18

'

It is

reached, but may extortion unrelated to loan sharking activity
be reached also.

Q

Isn't it true in Nsw York that the person

who got the loan could go to court an3 have it wiped out

on

the grounds it was usurious?
A

That's a perfect defense to the loan.

If

the loan shark were to sue the usurious rate of interest would
render, in the nature of a defense, the loan void and unen­
forceable.

Yes.
9

But we also have the situation where people who

trust, the same as in the gambling business, where these sort

That, I think, is the basic defect in this

13

statute.

Certainly if a certain type of extortional behavior

15

could be reasonably defined as present in organized crime

loan sharking, I think Congress could legislate against that.

17

Q

May I ask you how much this loan was?

!8

A

Originally $1,000.

19

Q

What was the interest rate to be paid?

20

A

I would estimate it to be in excess of 35

It went up to $3,000

percent, which is mentioned in the statute.

21

22

Q

Payable how often?

23

A

Payable at usurious terms.

I think the

original loan was $1,000 payable at the rate of $100 and some-

24

odd dollars — $105 aweek for 14 xveeks.

25

11

!

Q

Now, what was the extortion used?

2

A

Welly Mr. Miranda3s business proved to be

3

unsuccessful and he was unable to meet the payments.

4

Petitioner allegedly went to Mr. Miranda and told him that —-

No.

23

No; he had made reference to other

people, to another person who had gone to the

Mr. Krieger you have repeated several

dissent in this case.

All right, but you think that under the

sense, of the hearings is to attack organized crime there
should be required that there is an organized criminal element

13

as

in a gambling statute they seek a criminal organization

14

in order to bring that gambling within the Federal area*»

there is nothing within a Congressional hearing which would
support the findings that he had an impact upon interstate
commerce.

If he is in the business of loan sharking and he

utilises other people then he may well be engaged in an or­
ganized criminal activity ---Q

Suppose it is, but it has no connection wit!

interstate commerce?
A

I think that if it is an organized criminal

activity and Congress, through the hearings, has established
organized criminal activity as affecting interstate commerce,
15

1

it may well be that under the Wickard against Filburn rule he

2

may find himself brought in within the gambit —
Q

3

But there you have something more than an

4

organized crime? you have it making an impact of some kind on

5

interstate commerce.

6

A

Yes, sir —

7

Q

Is that what you claim there must be in

8

order for it to be a valid Federal statute?
A

9

1 do not contend that the impact on inter­

10

state commerce has to foe proved at the trial if the definition

ii

of the criminal activity includes within it, such provable

12

facts — such provable facts at a crime level as it was, of

1.3

necessity linked to criminal activity to interstate commerce.
Q

14

IS
16

Well, I suppose you and I would agree that

-- at least under existing constitutional law, that Congress
couldn8fc make a local larceny of a Federal criminal offense.

17

But, as a juror would you concede that if a person were in the

18

business of being — of grand larceny, that Congress could do

19

so?

3

A

No.

But there are new certain standards in

there which I think make that statute not necessarily

constitutionally objectionable as opposed to this statute.

Q

But it’s not just that it's organized; it

has to — there has to have been a finding or evidence that

it's a national or at least an interstate organization.

so*

conceded that this conduct of your client which you emphasised

to us earlier# was all within the City of Brooklyn# New York.

Why would# conceding as you tell me you did — I didn't mis­

I did not

I meant to surround that statement with

to extortionist credit being carried on extensively in inter­
state and foreign commerce and through the means and instru­

credit transactions are truly intrastate in character, they
nevertheless directly affect interstate and foreign commerce.
And, extortionist credit transactions directly impair the
effectiveness and frustrate the purposes of the laws enacted
by Congress on the subject of bankruptcy and on the basis of
these findings the Congress determined that the provisions of
the statute, including that involved here, are necessary and
proper for the purpose of carrying into execution the powers
of Congress to regulate commerce and establish uniform

a person in the position of the man involved here to get the

benefit of the Bankruptcy Act because he may get a discharge

in court, but he will also get a broken arm or worse from the

usurers who are involved here.

He is afraid to seek bank­

fact, thwarted by the extortionate credit methods.

1©
.20

Perhaps the closest and most important

is a decision of more than 50 years ago of the great opinion bv
Justice Hughes in the Shreveport case», in 234 U.S.
The statute involved in that case was in general
terms, without any reference to or limitation t.o acts burdening

21

or affecting interstate commerce.

22

1 am quoting from page 355 and 356 of the ©pinion in .the

23
24
25

Shreveport cases

Congress provided that, and

"That it shall be unlawful for any common

carrier subject to the provisions of this act to make or give
any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage t© any

29

1

particular person, corapinny, firm or corporation or locality

2

in. any respect whatsoever, or to subject any particular person,

3

company, firm, corporation or locality to any undue or un­

4

reasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect

5

whatsoever*"

v

And there is no limitation in that statute with

6
7

respect to interstate commerce and the Court will recall that

8

inthe Shreveport case the court held that the.statute was

9

broad enough to apply to discrimination in intrastate commerce

10

and that Congress had the constitutional power to enact that

11

statute.
We come a good many years later to the National

12

IS

Labor Relations Act.

The first, great decision there was

14

15

That statute, by its terras is

are in commerce or affecting commerce.

Thus, it is a statute

which is worded somewhat differently than the one here, but the
language of the Court is instructive on page 37 of 301 U.S.
"Undoubtedly the scope of this power must be considered in the
t•

*.. .

and remote? that to embrace them in view of our complex
society would effectually obliterate the distinction between
what is national and what is local and create a completely

thing of that sort here.

Judge Hays did in dissent, that this is; a criminal statute.

construed, but more no question of construction is raised in

this case.
