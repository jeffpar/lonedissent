ORAL ARGUMENT BY THOMAS C. BINKLEY, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

We will hear arguments

MR. BINKLEY;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court;

10

My name is Thomas C. Binkley.

I am a member of

11

the firm of Houser, Thomas, Summers and Binkley and my Co-

12

Counsel is Mr. Philip Carden from Nashville.
This ~ the Petitioner in this case was tried

under Federal District Court in Nashville, where he was charged

In this

All of this occurred

after the Petitioner was returned to the penitentiary,
Now, our primary contentions before the Court,
our first proposition? we3re saying that the recent rulings of
the Court have changed or should change the conspiracy excep­
tion to the hearsay rule,

We think this is especially true in

view of the Bruton decision and in view of the Jackson versus
Dezmo case decided before Bruton, and it is our contention that
Bruton draws these cases together.
As the Court will recall, on the Jackson case it
was confirmed with, a confession which was turned over to the
jury under the New York rule which provided that the jury
should determine whether the confession is voluntary or not.
We think, even though it hasn't been extended at this point to
cover cases involving conspiracy, it is our contention that it
should .follow»

i

In the Court below the District Judge allowed

2

proof to be offered and determined that the jury should deter™

■3

mine whether or not a conspiracy9 in fact* existed? whether

©r not out-of-court statements made by a declarant who was —

5

the declarant making the out-of-court statement was a part of

6

the conspiracy? whether the statements whre made in the course

7

of the conspiracy and v/hether it was in furtherance ©f the con­

8

spiracy o

9

10

Q

You don’t claim that Burton itself did

away with the co-conspirator rule, did it?

11

A

Did away with what. Your Honor?

12

Q

The Co-conspirator Rule*

13

A

No*, sir? it9s our contention that the

14

rationale of Bruton and the eases preceding Bruton: Jackson

15

versus Denno and others which are mentioned in Bruton, that the

16

logical consequence is to d® away with the conspiracy excep­

17

tion rulesas it is now employed by thh Federal Court*

18

We can sea little difference in allowing,in

19

saying it*s a violation of constitutional rights fc© allow a

20

jury to determine the voluntariness ©f a confession and then

21

©n theoother hand say that it wouldn't be proper or that.'it

22

would be proper for them to determine whether a conspiracy, in

23

fact, existed*

24
25

And we submit, in our case, in the present case
before the Court, the way it was tried we allowed the ’

4

1

©ut“o£»court hearsay statements to corns in.

We allowed the

2

prosecution — the prosecution, of course, can start the ©as®

3

anywhere -they want to.

4

this case with the murder count and then the jury has to sift

5

through 13 days of testimony and determina whether or not this

6

conspiracy, in fact, existed before they can waive testimony.

The prosecution started the case in

7

And we submit, especially in the framework of our

8

case that it was difficult for the trial judge t© keep up with

3

the statements without requiring the jury to, in effect,

10

determine whether the conspiracy existed by the hearsay state­

11

ments they were hearing.
And we feel that the proper rule, the rule that

12
13

should fee required of any district court in trying this would

14

be Erst: to determine whether the conspiracy exists, without

15

turning this over tothe jury.

16

the rationale ©£ the Bruton case would require this rule.
Q

17

And it is our contention that

Ones an argument was made, as long as I

18

have been at the bar, every trial, every conspiracy trial which

13

til® judge has mad© subject to connection, that argument has

20

always been made for 49 years —

21

22

25

Yes, sir.

Q

Wall, if ~ he wanted to fee given life.

A

23
24

A

it.

Well, Your Honor —

I think aw is the perfect time to change,

1 think we have come this way and I think this is the way

the courts ar© leaning, and as was stated in one of the cases:
S

:

1

there is no way that we can guarantee a defendant a perfect

2

trial»

3

and certainly you obviate- some ©f the difficulties you have if

4

you require it first b© established that the conspiracy essists.

Ws have t© guarantee him as fair a trial as we can?

5

Q

The judge did charge a conspiracy* if I

6

recollect the chargee that the jury could not infer membership

7

from th@ conspiracyf in the conspiracy;, except through feh@

3

testimony that was directly admissible against the defendant»
.t

A

Yes, sir»

But this is the problem that

10

the Court has been faced with in the Jackson

11

and was stated by Justice Jackson in the Krulewifcch case* that

12

you just can't escpaet the jury t® b® able fc© sift all this
*
through and there has to be a limitation on human beings®

13

case and others

And in the present case before the Court* with

14
15

the conglomeration of proof that was offered we just feel that

IS

it would be impossible for the jury to determine this®
- Our secondproposition is concerned with the fact

17
18

that we are stating that the petitioner herein was deprived ©f

1

a fair trial by all ©f this prejudice by not having a sever-

20

ance.

21

volved in that he was incarcerated at the time the alleged

22

murder was committed* .at the time the second bank robbery was

23

committed and could have had no part in this? at least it would

24

have to be affirmatively shown that he had a part in it®

25

His ease was different from the other defendants in­

Since the 1 66 Amendment f© Rule 14 it8s up to the

district Judge if he sees there is going to b® some prejudice

involved, to sever the oases.

Q

This can be done even without

Now, when you just said that he claims

5

that he was incarcerated in prison when "this93 took place, 1

6

am not sure what your antecedent to 95this" was.

7

incarcerated when the bank robbery occurred; was he?
A

cerated on June 5th.

He wasn't

May it please Your Honor, he was incar­
He wasn't incarcerated at the time the

10

first bank robbery took place, which was April 24, 1967, but

11

there was a second substantive charge of a bank robbery which

12

took place on August 3rd and he was incarcerated at that time.
Q

13
14

He could be part of a conspiracy, a pre­

existing conspiracy, could he not?

15

A

Well, he —

16

Q

It may have intended to cover many bank

17

robberies, but was interrupted by his recapture.
A

18

Well, if Your Honor please, I haven't been

19

able t© find from the Court, from this Court directly on this.

20

The Court of

21

that once a conspirator is arrested, at least as far as the

22

conspiracy is concerned his part in the 'conspiracy is termina­

23

ted.

24
25

-Appeals has held in two cases cited in our brief

Wow, certainly a person in jail, I am sure, could
take part in a conspiracy, but I think at the time tie's arrested

7

1

there would fee a prescription that his part has ended and it

2

would be on the government to affirmatively show that his part

3

continued.

4

Q

Why does that add to the Government's

5

burden to prove every element beyond a reasonable doubt,

6

that an additional burden?

7

your point is there.

8
9

A

is

18m having difficulty seeing what

Well, as far as proving the conspiracy,

this doesn3 fc add — as far as proving the continuing part of

10

the conspiracy this is just a pool of evidence, if Your.Honor

11

please, of the burden of going forward with the proof.

12

tainly the Government can show that.be was a part of the con­

13

spiracy and if feh® Government can prove that he was a part of

14

it up to a point and they prove this beyond a reasonable doubt,

15

certainly he can be convicted of conspiracy.

16

Cer­

The complaint the Petitioner makes about the

17

matters that took place after he was arrested is that this not

«8

only affected the conspiracy count, it affected the substantive

19

count, and put him in a position where, as we argue in the

20

case, there were only two witnesses against him and witnesses

21

wa say ware of questionable character.

22

circumstances in this case put the Petitioner in such a posi­

23

tion it is our contention that the jury couldn't waive the

24

testimony of these two witnesses against him.

25

But the totality of the

And we feel this could all have been taken eare

1

of by a severance»

2

And the severance was asked for initially»

For example* as we point out,, the case was

3

started by the prosecution putting on evidence of a murder that

4

took place»

5

murder which the Petitioner had no part in whatever.

And then

6

we had testimony concerning this other bank robbery,

There

7

tvas testimony in the record* and the Government sought to put

8

in testimony where witnesses had been intimidated* and cer­

9

tainly this is something by the allegations* that had to happen

10
11

There were four days of testimony concerning this

after the Petitioner had been incarcerated.
Q

Was there any request for an instruction

12

as to the proof concerning the substantive acts that took place

13

after the rearrest and recapture» of Petitioner?

14

A

No* sir.

15

Q

Were there any objections on that?

16

A

No* sir? there were objections made all

17

during the trial concerning this-but to my best recollection we

18

didn't ask for any special instructions.

19

Q

Well* certainly it would have been appro­

20

priate to request and appropriate to grant an instruction

21

specifically aimed at the substantive events after his re­

22

capture? was it not?

23
24
25

A

Well* we feel that it possibly would and

in light of the judge's rulings during the trial.
Q

Well* if you had asked for that instruction
9

1

and it had been denied your arguments that you are making now

2

would have a bit more force * at least with me.

3

dicta °t ask for such an instruction.

But, you

4

A

5

If it may please the Courts the third matter we

No, sir.

6

are contending is concerned with whether or not the conspiracy

7

continued as far as the Petitioner was concerned after ha was

8

arrestedP and there apparently the Government is not contesting

9

this particular part of it.

And, as wa have stated before,

10

our primary contention her® is, even if we had had limiting

11

instructions with the mass of proof that went in this case,

12

both by hearsay and nonhears&y and for matter unrelated to the

13

charges against the Petitioner, that I don8t think it's -- it

14

is our contention there is no way the jury could have sifted

15

through this and com® up with the proper decision»

16

And there, is no way, with the instructions from

17

the court that the jury could have sifted the

18

theinadmissible and rendered a.fair verdict, at least as far

19

as this Petitioner is concerned.

20

admissible from

If the Court has no other questions at this time
'

21

22

I would like to reserve my remaining 'time for rebuttal»
Q

— Judge Edwards in the Sixth Circuit —

23

there is a paragraph there that says; "As to Bostic, although*

24

lie was in the penitentiary some time before Ferguson's murder,

25

there is no evidence that he had renounced or withdrawn from th«:

10

1

conspiracy.

You may remember that.

2

A

Yes , sir? X know it.

3

Q

And it's now my understanding in light

4

of what — of this record,, that the Government never claimed

5

that ha continued to be a member of the conspiracy after his

S

arrest and return to prison.

7

the record that appears on page 12 and 13 of the Government8s

8

brief which shows that the prosecutor made clear that in June

3

Mr. Bostic leaves the conspiracy because he Ss arrested and sent

11

no longer a party to the conspiracy, and so on.

12

So at that point, of course, Bostic is

X gather from -the few things X just read you that

13

the Court of Appeals was, at least in that respect, misappre­

14

hended what the Government0s claim was.

15

A

Apparently —

The statement made by Judge Edwards is

16

clearly in conflict with other Court of Appeals decisions nad

17

this is the only statement that X know of made in the trial,

18

this by the prosecutor, where he says that he leaves the con­

19

spiracy becauss he’s sent to the penitentiary but continuing

20

on here — X don’t know what the jury thought this meant, where

21

it says? "So at this point of course he’s no longer a part of

22

the conspiracy, but nonetheless, this would not prevent this

23

from being a single continuing conspiracy."

24

Q

That was the overall conspiracy —

25

A

Yes, sir.

11

1

Q

And then in the opposition to the

2

petition for certiorari in-this ease the Government stated the

3

fact that there had been acharge here of conspiracy to commit

4

murder, and -there was no such charge in the indictment? was

5

there?

6

A

There is --

7

Q

I'm not being critical of you? I8m saying

8

that that was a misstatement, I gather, in the Government's

9

opposition,,

10

A

Well, there was a substantive charge as a

11

part of the conspiracy, and then there was another charge of

12

committing murder to avoid apprehension*
Q

13
14

So --

ted Bostic was not charged with murder or

with conspiracy to cosmit.:.murder? am I right about that?

That8& right»

Of course they are charged

Because the fact is that, as was made

22

clear, he was in prison for about three months before the

It is my impression of the record that

his opening statement made that very clear.

A

Yes, sir.

It was in connection with the statement, I

10

think, that at that point Bostic goes out ©f the conspiracy.
A

11

WE11, sir, of course he didn't come back

12

for ten days and this jury was locked up for 29 clays, so a

was said.

9

to the jury that Bostic was not regarded as involved in the

But when you go through the whole

10

murder.

And that appears not only from page «—» that8 s the

11

opening argument at the close of the case that we quote on

12

page 12 to 13 of the case.
I don01 have to tell the Court how important that

13
14

is to a jury.
Q

15
16

Then 2 was mistaken when I said it was the

opening statement! it was the argument t© the jury.
A

17

It was the opening argument at the close

18

of the case.

But, that appeared earlier in 'the trial, too.

And I call your attention to the voir dire of the jury when

20

they were being picked, and that took a lot of time because of

And certainly reading the

There is nothing in the record which suggests that.

2

matter of fact, in relation to this petition there aren't very

3

many co-conspirator declarations that have any significance.

4

Aside from the murder the proof was like this:

5

As a

Ons woman testified who was named originally as a

6

defendant^ testified that in April he and Ethridge decided •=»-

7

they had been robbing merchandise before and they decided that

8

wasn't any good because they could get caught with the mer­

9

chandise? money was safer? that they were going to the bank

11

would get people to do it for them.

As I understand it, the murder was

charged as an overt act; is that right?

14

A

Yes o

15

Q

Now, supposing

that had been the only

16

overt act charged in the indictment? could that have been used

17

to prove the conspiracy against Bostic?
A

I don't think so.

You say you do not?

I do not think so.

But the question as to Bostic is a question of
withdrawal» and that’s a question of fact and on these facts I
think there really is a doubt that he had willy-nilly been
withdrawn from the conspiracy.
Q

Yes» or removed from it.

A

Removed — I don’t know that it was a

voluntary withdrawal» but he had withdrawn.
Q

Did the prosecutor say that to the jury?

A

Yes? that’s that quotation on pages 12

and 13 of our brief.
Q

But there wasn’t any instruction on it?

A

Mo? there wasn’t any instruction speci­

fically on it.

There was an instruction that somebody

could

withdraw and there wasn’t any instruction©» the consequences of
withdrawal» although I think it was evident** implicit in that

is if he had withdrawn he wouldn’t be held.

There is no question, I

18

think, that on the facts of this case, and X think there isn't

19

any question the jury so understood

20

highly selective jury in its verdict, even as to the others,

21

And for example, there is an August bank robbery that was

22

charged but the jury wasn't satisfied as to the proof of that

So that we do not have as to this Petitioner the

13

In the face of the fact that the jury clearly found that

these people were in a conspiracy to commit the Bordeaux rob­

finding about the other bank robberies, but they clearly found

And, as I say, the evidence is overwhelming that

Then it is perfectly clear that

the jury found that the conspiracy to rob banks and at least

24

the overt act ©£ the Bordeaux robbery, whether in addition it

25

also found the murder, would be unimportant.

22

Q

1

Isn't there another at least arguable

2

response to that?

Namely, that the Government concede,, more

3

than conceded, asserted flatly that after he returned to

4

prison on his recapture he was out ©f the conspiracy?

5

A

Yes.

6

Q

That was probably at least as strong as

the instructions from the court? since it came right from the

prosecutor.

A

Well, I think that is very clear and I

also think that if you g© through the record, which you can't

do when you start, just putting together all the objections in

H@ wasn't even

It was made clear throughout the

trial that while it was an overt act in furtherance of the con­
spiracy, with Ethridge in the center of

'the conspiracy —

that comes through at the trial also -- it was perfectly clear
throughout the trial that nobody was saying that not only

23

?

Bostic but Self and the other defendants9 nobody was accusing

anybody but Beard and Ethridge, as being responsible for the

murder.

And it was Ethridge that the center of the conspiracy,

Q

Miss Rosenberg, let me be very sure of

5

your position.

Bo X fake it, in your answer in response to

6

Justice White's question, despite the misapprehension of the

7

Sixth Circuit Panel and Judge Edwards in his ©pinion, is it

8

the Government's position that tills case in any event need not

9

he remanded to the Sissth Circuit?

10

A

Yes.

That is our position because ©ur

11

position is that if is perfectly clear on this record in every

12

way that Bostic was not charged directly or by implication

13

with the murder.

14

this record that Bostic was properly convicted, both of the

15

Bordeaux bank robbery with which he was charged, and with being

16

a member of the conspiracy for the length of time that fo® was

17

out ©£ jail.

18

On the other hand it is perfectly clear ©a

X suppose he ' will always feel that as

21

A

Well, Your Honor, X think it's signifi~

22

cant that in the petition for certiorari and I think in his

23

brief he says the question is whether the Court of Appeals

24

should have charged him as being responsible for the murder.

25

And all that the Court of Appeals really says is that there was

24

1

no showing ©f affirmative withdrawal from the conspiracy.

2

don't think they said he did it or really had any part in it?

3

they just said technically and legally he hadn't withdrawn.

4

I think that was wrong, because 1 think that ©m these facts it

5

will show that he was taken off to the penitentiary and no-

6

body -- there's absolutely nothing in the record to show that

7

anybody even visited him after that.
2 think it would be wrong to impute the murder to

3
9

10

him, but I don't think it was done at the trial.

I think it

was made perfectly clear that he wasn't involved.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY THOMAS C. BINKLEY, ESQ.

13

OH BEHALF OF PETITIONER

14
15

MR. BINKLEY:

May it pleas© the Court:

16

There has been some confusion on this and 2 think,

17

at least in our argument today we have been drawn away from

18

what might possibly be oae of the minor issuers in the case.

19

But, to answer in a way, the record will show that the parts

20

of the testimony we haw cited in the appendix will show that

21

the prosecutor wasn't doing me any favor and the petitioner

22

any favor when he conceded that the Petitioner was back in the

23

penitentiary, because I tried in most of the case to keep that

24

out.

25

incarceration because it certainly doesn't help you before a

And so I didn’t feel I could elaborate on this man's

25

1

jury to let you know that your client’s permanent place of

2

residence at this time is the state penitentiary.

3

Q

Yes* but didn’t it help you quite a bit

4

to have him cut loose from this, at least very much premedi­

5

tated murder, motivated murder?

6

didn’t it?

h

7

It helped him a lot there?

Yes, sir? I am sure that that did help

Mm if, in fact, this was done.

jury can remove this from their minds and take it away,
especially in view ©£ everything else that came in.
Mow, there was testimony that’s pointed out in

12
13

©ur brief and we’ve cited examples in the appendix of portions

14

where the Government impeached their own witnesses with prior

15

statements not made by the person, but alleged to have been

16

mad© by the FBI man, where the statement of what the FBI man

17

said the witness said was reared in open court t© impeach.

18

There was also some testimony of declarations

19

made by Ferguson. who of course was dead, and we have no way

20

to cross-examine.

21

— when Beard was being testified.

22

Bear’d a little out of the rationale of the Bruton case, but

23

we submit that we have pointed out instances where tills has

24

happened.

25

There was also an FBI report brought in by
Of course, this takes

Mow, there was a discussionin court when
26

I

Ferguson8s brother was testifying and they were trying to

2

allow this to com© in by asking Ferguson's brother first if

3

he knew any of the parties, and then said? "Stow, don5t name

4

any of the parties, but go ahead and tell us what was said.”

5

And of course, that was objacted to, but that was allowed to

6

come in.
It’s our contention that it should be spalled out

7
8

that now is the appropriate time the rationale of the Bruton

9

case, taking into account the Jackson case and others, should

10

set down the rules that the Government, just like in a question

11

of voluntary confession the trial judge should first determine

12

there is a conspiracy before he allows all of this hearsay to

13

come in and then ask the jury after it has heard all of this to

14

datermine whether a conspiracy existed.
A conspiracy case is a difficult case to try.

15

The

18

record shows that every case of hearsay and double hearsay was

17

brought info this record by the prosecutor standing up and

18

sayings "But, Your Honor, this is a conspiracy case, which

19

means everything goes.”

20

th® time, and certainly if the Court doesn't feel that this

21

should b© reversed on, under the Bruton rule, certainly it was

22

prejudicial and prejudice could have been taken away by a

23

severance.

24
25

Thus, it's ©ur contention that now is

And certainly with the obstacles, the difficulties
the Court of Appeals found in this, that the judge, the trial
27

1

judge found* certainly it should have been known that we could

2

have avoided any of this by having a separate trial and we811

3

never know -- of course we concede the jury convicted — but

4

we will never know how they would have weighed the testimony

5

of the two witnesses against the petitioner herein had their

S

minds not been cluttered with all these other things that I

7

couldn’t remove from the jury* just as I couldn’t remove my­

8

self from the counsel table where we were required to be by the

9

Courto

10
11

And it is our contention that this case should b®
reversed and remanded on our two grounds„
