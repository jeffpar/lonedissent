ORAL ARGUMENT BY GORDON GOOCH, GENERAL COUNSEL
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

6

MR. 600CII:

7

8

Mr. Chief Justice and. may it please

the Court:
This, of course, is the same case as 464»

©

The

10

Federal Power Commission has appealed the judgmentof the Fifth

II

Circuit which circumscribed the discretion committed to the

12

Commission in rate-making in connection with interconnections

13

under the Federal Power.
The Federal Power Commission is charged by

14

15

Congress with the responsibility of seeing to it that all

16

citizens of the United States have a reliable and adequate

17

supply of power in this country and with due deference to en­

18

vironment.

19

In this particular case the Commission was called

20

upon by the City of Gainesville, a municipal-owned, but entirely

21

self-sufficient generating system, to hold a hearing to deter­

22
23

24
25

mine whether or not an interconnection should be ordered with a
larger investor-owned utility,, th§- Florida Power Corporation.
And if so, at what rate.
After extensive hearings before the Commission
2

1

that were held not only in Washington but in Florida, the

2

Cononission considered the type of evidence that Mr» Emory has

3

recited here; it considered the type of evidence that Mr»

4

Spiegel has recited here and in addition, had the staffkicks

5

placed in the record by those in -the Bureau of Power at the

6

Federal Power Commission who are charged with the responsibility

1

of looking over these problems nationwide.

8

After the Examiner's decision the Commission
considered the case on its merits and concluded the following:

9
10

It concluded first that an interconnection was in the public

si

interest; that it placed no undue burden at all on Florida

12

Power or the system that Florida was connected with; that it

13

would not require Florida Power to increase any facilities»

14

The Commission determined that the service to

15

Florida Power's customers- would not be impaired at all»

18

Commission assigned 100 percent of the cost of the interconnec­

17

tion to the City of Gainesville and the Commission set —
Q

18

A

20
21

,

23

Bv that you mean the transmission lines

and whatever facilities go with that?

19

22

The

Yes, sir.

And assign a rate to be charged for the actual
energy transferred across the interconnection»
Wow, what the Commission did in its order was to
place Gainesville in the same position that it would have
been if the five other utilities in the Florida operating group
3

1

had admitted it to its informal membership, with one signifi­

1

cant exception: the Commission imposed on the City of

3

Gainesville as a condition for the interconnection, that it

4

maintain an installed reserve capacity, something that none of

5

the other members of the Florida operating committee are re­

S

quired to do.

7

Now, much argument is made here —

8

Q

0

Mr. Gooch, that is maintain what kind of

a reserve capacity?
A

to

The installed reserve capacity is required

11

to maintain 115 percent of its peak in installed generating

12

capacity.

13

Q

Installed?

14

A

Yes, sir.

15

Q

Did that involve their making any other

1

A

Yes, sir.

18

Q

— to increase their —

19

A

Yes, sir.

20

Q

Does the record show whetherthey

10

21

investment —*

would

have done that absent, this interconnection?
A

Sir, the record,

asclosed

in

e65 had

projections all the way through 1979 and in the projections it
showed by staff witnesses the projected additional generation
that would be required.

The Federal Power Commission, though,
4

1

made it possible for Gainesville to purchase that power rather

a

th&n install it if it was in their economic benefits to do so.

3

Now, as through -the year, roughly 1970, but

4

based on the projections of 5 65, with the addition of the two

5

15 megawatt gas turbines,, the City of Gainesville wouidhave

6

adequate installed capacities to meet 'the 115 percent obliga­

7

tion imposed on them by the Federal Power Commission.

8

their load grows they have the burden of maintaining the in­

©

stalled reserve.

10
11

But, as

Q

How many megawatts was the installed

A

Well, as of the projection in the record

reserve?

12
13

the City of Gainesville at the present time would have 138

14

megawatts of installed.

IS

in the year 1970, according to the record that was back in '65

16

in the projections.

They had anticipated peak of about 102

How long did it take to conduct the

Sir, it went on £rom #65 and it didn’t

hearings?

20

clear the Commission, the final opinion of the hearings until

21

January of 869.

22

Q

How long, how many volumes of evidence?

23

A

I would say when they are condensed it’s

24

about 13 in transcript form, sir.

25

from the City of Gainesville in my recollection, including the
5

We have had three witnesses

■i

witness from the Clay County Cooperative and witnesses from

2

Florida Power; we had three staff witnesses, all subject to

3

cross-examination before the Examiner»

4

How, the main point that I would like to make is

S

that I cannot, for the life of me, see how anyone can read the

6

order of the Federal Power Commission as requiring firm service

7

to be rendered by Florida Power ""to the City of Gainesville.

8

I cannot see in any way how that order could be so construed.

9

The order is set aid clearly says that it is a nonfirm power;

10

the order clearly says that the emergency service is subject to

II

the control of the dispatchers and the order clearly says that

12

the operation of the interconnection would be left to a com­

13

mittee which the Commission ordered between the City of

14

Gainesville and the Florida Power Corporation.
Q

15
16

Well, are you saying that this is not

firm in the sense that it's only on a capacity available basis?
A

17

I am saying, sir, that the Florida Power

18

Corporation is not required by the order of the Federal Power

19

Commission to maintain 50 megawatts or 60 megawatts of capa­

20

bility at the Archer Substation at all times and under all cir­

21

cumstances for the benefit of the City of Gainesville.

22

are only ordered to make that power available if as, and when

23

it is available, to the Florida Power and its interconnected

24

system.

25

Q

They

In other words, as I understand what you
6

t

are saying ass they ar6 not required to keep a standby?

2

A

3

The second point I would like to make

4

Q

5

6
7

That's right* sir.

What happens if one of the Florida Power’s

other connections has a need for Florida Power's standby power
and is using it, then Gainesville comes along and needs some
and they can't get it? can they?

8

A

That.9s right* sir.

9

Q

And you say -that they have the right to

10

.^

refuse it or to open the switch?
A

11

I am saying, sir* that -the matter can be

12

handled in one of several ways:

13

the right to open the switch.

14

Powerhas the right, to tell the City of Gainesville to shed

IS

load.
Q

16

(1) that the Florida Power has
I am saying also that Florida

And if the City of Gainesville is already

17

using it — say the City of Gainesville has an outage and it

18

is using Florida Power's reserve — that is using it and then

19

some other connection of Florida Power’s system needs some?

20

A

May 1 change —•

21

Q

It also has the same need that Gainesville

23

A

Yes, sir.

24

Q

And that Florida Power can’t provide them

22

25

has.

both.
7

Well, let me —

1

A

Let me answer it this way, sir; if it is

z

a firm customer of Florida Power —

3

a question of impairing the ability

4
5

Q

in other words if it is

Yes, well, but I am talking about just one

of their —

6

A

Another standby?

7

Q

Another system.

3

A

Like the City ofOrlando, which is com­

9

parable in sise to the City of Gainesville.

to

Q

Yes.

11

A

It's if, as and when available to both

12

systems.

And I would assume that the dispatchers then would

13

have to get together and decide who is going to shed load and

14

how they are going to lay it off among themselves.

IS

0

As I understand it •—

16

Q

Mr. Gooch, I have a problems when there is

17

a sudden breakdown of the generator in Gainesville, does the

18

committee meet?

19

A

No, sir; the purpose of -the committee is

20

to set up theoperating procedures as to how the interconnection

21

will be set up; what sort of relays will be put in there; what

22

sort of — how the system will be operated.

23
24
23

Q

It is true —»

As of right now, assuming that the order

of the Federal Power Commission is put into effect
A

Yes, sir.
8

1

Q

And next year Gainesville has a breakdown.

z

A

Yes, sir.

3

Q

Do they get it or don't they?

4

A

That depends on, first; whether it is

5

available under the Florida Power Corporation's system, point

S

one? point twos it has to be scheduled in.

7

8

Q

1 don't understand this, for obvious

reasons, but how do you schedule this sudden breakdown?

9

A

Well, you don't schedule the sudden break-

10

down.

11

frankly it will flow mostly from Gainesville to Florida Power

12

according to the staffkicks.

13

ly, as if a load goes down on one or the other side of the

14

interconnection, power will flow, but that doesn't mean it will

15

flow forever.

IS

power is needed somewhere else.

The point is that it is true that power will flow —

But it is true that instantaneous

It can be shut off almost immediately if the

17

Q

I get it.

18

Q

Did I understand you to say that the firm

19

customers of Florida Power, under their pool agreements or

20

otherwise, have a prior claim on the power over Gainesville?

21
22

A

I say that the firm's customers do have a

prior claim on the power? yes, sir.

23

Q

But not the pool arrangements?

24

A

Not the pool, because, as the Commission

25

evidence shows, in fact, by installing Gainesville into the
9

1

pool under the terms, what the Commission was really trying to

2

do was to fife Gainesville in as a full-fledged member of the

3

pool without being, having to pay twice the dues because they

4

were late in joining»

5

having done that, we're blamed because we didn't follow what

6

someone else says the industry practice is»

7
8
0

And instead of getting any credit for

Well, of course, the Commission is under no
obligation to follow what the industry practice is.
Q

Yes, but Mr. Gooch, has the Commission eve:;

10

approved an interconnection where some payment is provided

11

more than just for the power when and as used?

12

A

The —if we take the instances which were
*s

13

not in the record but mentioned in the briefs of Florida Power,

14

I caused those specific instances to be checked by the section

IS

at the Federal Power Commission who reviews those things and

16

they informed me that if we were to resolve that kind of dis­

17

pute at this hearing they would testify that none of the con­

18

tracts cited by the Florida Power Corporation contained the

19

kind of standby charge that Florida —

20

Q

But, I understood from Mr. Emory- — perhaps

21

I misunderstood him, b ut some of their connections were paying

22

more than it is going to cost Gainesville?

23
24

A

Well, sir, on page 26 ©f their brief they

refer to a 12-megawatt sale which is, I believe the one that Mr.
Emory was referring to.

That was, in our view, an entirely
10

1

different situation because the line was placed in for the

2

benefit of Florida Power’s customers.

3

time that the evidence was in in this case, subsequent to that

4

time, the Florida Power Corporation came in said that they had

S

negotiated a deal with another company in which they had im­

6

posed this sort of standby charge.

Now, subsequent fco 'the

1

Q

With

another system?

8

A

Well —

9

Q

Not a paying customer?

10

A

That

was our understanding, but it — the

11

point that causes the problem is that the only reason to bring

12

up that kind of point, is to claim that the Federal Power Com­

13

mission gave Gainesville better membership conditions in the

14

pool than others have.

15

evidence shows that Gainesville has the same thing.

IQ
17

Q

Now, we say that is not so and all the

Even if it was so, I suppose there were

two ways of curing it?

18

A

Yes,

sir.

19

And the second I am just getting ready to bring

20

up, and that is that the Commission specifically provided in

21

its order that Florida Power Corporation may file for a rate

22

increase under the Commission’s regulations if they are not

23

getting what they think they are entitled to under the service

24

in the interconnection.

25

Q

They won’t know anything about that in the
11

1

way of experience until they have some interchange?

2

A

Precisely, and the Commission — the

3

expert evidence on which the Commission relied showed that the

4

City of Gainesville will be providing proportionately more

5

service to Florida Power than otherwise*

6

Nov?, I'd like to touch on that point for a

7

second, if I might,

8

that they can give 50 or 60 megax^atts without even feeling it

9

in their system.

10

50 to 60 megawatts: Florida Power admits

They have got a swing of 30 to 40 megawatts

which they say.means nothing to them.
But I say that 50 megawatts going back across the

21
12

interconnection from Gainesville to Florida Power can't be too

13

insignificant if Florida Power is buying firm from tiny Orlando

4
IS

at

00 megawatts.

If the interconnection, the valid intercon­

nection between the Florida Power system and its members to the

6

north in Georgia who have opened at

7

Power will negotiate a

30 megawatts ~ if Florida

2-megawatfc transaction and they have

IS

cited in their brief as an example, as if as the minutes of the

19

Florida Operating Committee show, the Florida Operating Com­

20

mittee doss not even maintain at all times adequate spinning

22

reserves under their own standards.

22

And if, as in this record, the City of Gainesville

23

and Florida Power Corporation are arguing over service to indi­

24

vidual customers in Alachua County, it seems to me -chat we can­

25

not argue that. 50 megawatts is insignificant to Florida Power
2

1

2

Corporation»
Now, the Commission has to resolve these kinds of

3

disputes all the time and they would have to resolve the dis­

4

putas not only because it is a dispute between parties, but,

5

because they have an affirmativa obligation to develop a policy

6

that will work nationwide♦

And the staff tries to do its best

7

to put on a case that will be of assistance to the Commission.

8

The Commission, of course, doesn't always take the best part of

9

anybody’s case, but

they resolve the disputes in this case?

io

they set the rates and they ordered the interconnection and we

n

believe the Fifth Circuit x^as in error in saying that the Com­

12

mission may not set the rate on the basis that they did»

13
14

Q

Mr. Gooch, you referred to the expert

testimony put in by the Commission staff, I take it?

IS

A

Yes, sir.

IS

Q

On this flow

17

that wouldbe from

Gainesville, more likely to Florida Power.

18

A

Yes, sir.

19

Q

Was that disputed or was that

Well, it is disputed in the sense that I

undisputed?

21

don't — it’s difficult to say.

22

were witnesses that said that that's just a mathematical pro­

23

bability and tfaa mere fact that it's a mathematical probability

24

doesn’t mean that- it actually will happen.

25

of arguments to the weight of it addressed to the Commission.
13

Yes, it was disputed.

There

There were plenty

1

But I do not recall any competing exhibits that showed any

2

different.

3
4

Q

What were the findings of the Commission

A

The Commission found that it was likely

on the point?

5

e

that Florida Power would be drawing on the interconnection more

7

than the City of Gainesville would and the Commission* by im­

0

posing the same standards of responsibility on Gainesville as

0

were imposed on Florida Power by the operating agreement* the

10

Commission felt there was an equality here.

11

And* since Gainesville can* at some period* ■!

12

deliver the full 30 to 60 megawatts -- not all the time ..

13

across the interconnection ~

14

Q

The Court of Appeals set that finding

A

The Court of Appeals said that that par­

13

16

aside?

17

ticular finding was not entitled to weight under the substan­

18

tial evidence rule.

19

fits that the Federal Power Commission found for the Florida

20

Power system were vague and

21

The Court of Appeals said that the bene­

nsubstantial.

And the Court said that because of the firm

22

obligation that was being imposed on Florida Power by the Com­

23

mission's order that a standby charge was in order and -the Com­

24

mission would have to coma up under some theory to do this.

25

Q

And the Commission found there was no such

14

‘1

firm

A

2

That’s right..

The Commission ordered

3

absolutely ordered no firm and if there was any doubt that the

4

Commission ordered the firm you would have thought that the

5

Florida Power, in their motion for rehearing, before the Commis­

6

sion would have pointed out an inconsistency in the order

7

between sayings

8

tion and. the facilities that were actually being ordered in.

9

But nothing appears in the rehearing and —
Q

10

-This is a nonfirm order as to the interconnec­

I suppose tliis matter remains within the

11

jurisdiction of the Commission in the sense thatif two years

12

from now a showing could be made under the experience this was

13

connectable on the basis of new developments not now in the

14

record, the Commission should alter its order?

15

A

Yes, sir»

IS

Q

And there is no

reason, from your

17

experience, I imagine down there with the Commission, to

18

imagine that if it does show anything like that the company

19

won’t call it to your attention?

ORAL ARGUMENT BY RICHARD W. EMORY, ESQ.

Thank you, Mr. Gooch.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

MR. EMORYs

24
25

iSo, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

tills Courts

15

1
2

I think it's important to understand what standby
is and 1 don;t think that that is really understood,

3

Mr, Justice Marshall referred to it as insurance

4

and that, in a sense, is what it is.

5

iss the water in the pipes all around -the City of Washington

6

where you have fire hydrants, and you've got quite a complicated

7

system of water pipes and fire hydrants and somebody is paying

8

for thos©water pipes and those fire hydrants and the water

9

that's in -there, and that is what Florida Power is paying for

10

and what we say we are not going to get any compensation for,

n

Maybe a better definition

We&e paying for the fire department, the fire

12

engines, the firemen, the water pipes and the water and it's

13

there at all hours of the day and night and it's constantly

14

available.
Now, we feel one of the reasons this has never

IS
16

come up before: this is the first time the Federal Power

17

Commission has ever come up with this idea of relative burdens?

18

sharing burdens in proportion to size.

19

ever dreamed of such a theory, as far as I know.

20

it anywhere in any of their decisions and the one decision that

21

they had on the subject -they said charges across an intercon­

22

nection should be based on reciprocity and mutual exchange of

23

services.

24

25

They never — nobody
You can't fine

And the cases or the rates that have come up
since, actually until this came along they really hadn’t passed
16

1

on any rates»

a

What we think makes this highly unfair and highly discrimina­

3

tory,- where the Federal Government agencies, Southeastern Power

4

Authority, which is an agency of the Department of Interior,

5

has come in with the same kind of standby charge request -they

6

have been allowed; they are getting $2.75 a kilowatt per year

7

for standby.

8

selling it to three people on, really a “when, as and if”

9

available basis.

They hadn*t held a forced interconnection case»

They have 100 megawatts of reserve and they are

And the contracts say that if any one of the

10

other three are using it,' it's to& bad, fellow; you can't get

11

it.
But, this is being paid for every hour of the day

or night.

have a breakdown and start taking power -they stop paying this

$2.75 and I think they pay $9.00 or $10 and a half.

higher rate.

Now, when they actually take power if they should

They pay a

But, in addition to paying for it they pay for

the fire department; they pay for the pipes that are in the
ground and the water that's at all times there.
Now, Gainesville -- something was said about

19

20

Gainesville maintaining this 15 percent reserve.

2!

you how ridiculous that is s they had 112 percent reserve when

22

we tried -this case and they proposed, by tapping into our

23
24
25

Let me show

transmission system and relying on us, to reduce that reserve
to 15 percent.

And what is 15 percent?

hundred megawatts of demand.

They have got a

We are talking about a 15-megawatt,
17

1

reserve and here we need 500 instantaneously and they are going

2

to reduce their reserve from 112 percent to 15 percent: and they

a

talk about that being a burden and to me it just doesn't make

4

any sense at all.

S

he decided that there should be definitely some charge for

Now:

And it is also not uncommon in these interconnec­

12

tion arrangements to split the benefits; to decide what the

14

savings are and one fellow gets half and the other gets half

15

and he proposed that standby be paid for by a splitting of the

16

financial savings.

17

think that would cost them a little more than what we propose

18

to charge them, although it's never been fully priced out.

19

it's a perfectly reasonable proposal and it is a proposal that

20

is used in many of these interconnection arrangements.

We don't object to that.

in the industry is called "firm power, firm service."

would require us to enlarge our generating facilities or would

6

give us an argument that it would require us to enlarge them,

7

Q

Then you would be entitled to pay for it?

A

Then we would be entitled to say they

didn't have any jurisdiction because they don't have the juris­

10

diction to undertake to do anything that would definitely,

positively, requireus to enlarge our facilities.

13

I'm not sure that -the Commission ever used the word or did use

14

the word, because actually, as I say, you don't need, to use the

15

word.

16

they say so or not.

17

It's a meaningless word.

Q

We are firmly bound whether

I imagine that if they had made a demand

18

and you didn't supply it audit would cost you a lot of money

19

you could then find more reason to say that the word "firm"

20

would have been pretty good in the contract.

21

A

Well, we can't envisage — we sincerely

22

and honestly cannot envisage their making a demand that we won't

23

supply and the Commission knows that and Gainesville knows that.

24

How could they reduce their reserve from 112 percent to 15 per­

25

cent, down to 15 megawatts if they didn't feel that their
21

generator capability was going to be firmly protected?

But 'they are trying to eliminate this

said Gainesville can reduce its reserve by about 100 percent if

they didn't feel that Florida Powerwas going to supply that.

Q

In Tallahassee I understood you to say

that the interconnection was too small to provide this standby.

What’s the point of having the interconnection?

A

This is something that I didn’t know a

thing about until I got this brief on Monday and I really don’t

know much about if.

22

it's a small connection; I guess we're supplying the power or

and positively to arrange for some mutuality and if there is

Now, I'll read one more thing out of the brief;

16

"The Report to the President of the Federal Power Commission on

17

the Prevention of Power Shortage,"and it recited this matter of

18

the problem of interconnections and the necessity for inter­

19

connections to provide reliability of service, particularly to

small systems and after pointing out the importance to

16

But also only when Gainesville had some

17

peculiar need for the power.

All of its regular needs it was

18

obligated to maintain a full reserve for.

19

A

Yes# sir.

20

Now, the reserve that Gainesville is required to

21

maintain under the Operating Committes formula is one thing?

22

what it lias the capability to put across that interconnection is

23

another.

-v

24
25

Mr. Emory would have you to believe that the
Gainesville system is so antiquated and so small that it has

29

1

a response of only two hours or more.

2

in the briefs they have two 15 megawatt gas turbines? they have

O

a 50—megawatt generator and a numberseven unit of 26 megawatts.

4

Their testimony is thatifc would always be running those two:

5

the 7 per 7 in number eight and had a number two available.

6

So# I suggest that it is somewhat unfair to the City of

Gainesville t& say that they cannot respond with'-emergency

power across that interconnection.

Nowt as to the relative benefits: again, by

9
10

imposing on the City of Gainesville a demand charge, a standby

11

charge, based on the size of their largest unit, what that

12

effectively does to rates to rate treatment, is to prevent the

13

City of Gainesville from increasing the size of its large::

14

generators, thereby increasing the amount of rate that the

15

citizens in Gainesville would have to pay if they cure going to

16

be an

isolated system.
It would mean that they would have to buy in

17
10

increments of smaller, less efficient generators so that there

Well, they wouldnet have to.

They would just have to pay a iittl® more

for them than Florida Power.
v

A

No, sir ~ oh, as the alternative?

Q

Yes o
30

A

!

Yes, sirj they would be faced with the

2

economic choice of not, completing the interconnection and

3

building their own generation and the Federal PcwerCommission

4

has recognised, just like Florida Power recognises that it is

5

uneconomic and wasteful to carry more installed capacity than

6

you are going to need for a reasonable period of time.
And so, rather than deprieate the City of

7
8

Gainesville for being able to reduce their installed capacity,

9

this is one of the purposes, one of the benefits of intercon­

10

nection.

And Florida Power cannot maintain its own and does

II

not maintain its own installed reserves by itself to take care

52

of itself in the event of major outages on its system.
So, it is easy to, I suppose, deprieate the

13
14

contribution that Gainesville can make but then we shoiald also

15

deprieate the contribution that Orlando makes, which is not that

much bigger than Gainesville, which includes a 100 megawatt

On value of service it seems to me unnecessary to
say that a regulatory commission is not bound to take into
consideration value of service.

The value of electricity to a

man in an iron lung is a lot more than the value of electricity
to someone making coffee in the morning.
