ORAL ARGUMENT BY LOUIS CHANDLER# ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

Q

MR. CHANDLER:

9
10

11

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Courts
There seems to be a relatively simple issue

12

that we have because we stated whether or not the National

13

Labor Relations Board may enforce the decision and order in an

14

unfair labor practice case,» which is based upon evidence in

IS

a transcript that it has long considered in review and based

w

upon conflicting testimony by witnesses # that the board or its

\1

trial examiner# neither heard nor observed.

v

18

The background of this case involves the filing

i

19

of a petition for an election by the union in a so-called

20

representation case# called an "R"

2!

of the phrase# as distinguished from a C case» which is not

22

fair labor practice —

23
24
25

case# in the parli&nce

tod a hearing was held; conflicting evidence was
presented and one of the questions involved# particularly# is
whether ©r not the system foremen were supervisors.

2

The

1

question involves some credibility because there was con-”

z

£listing testimony and this question as to supervisors became

3

erical because the company had an employee that it contended

4

was a supervisor, who was acting as an agent for the union in

5

soliciting authorization cards for the union»

6

And this would change the interest of the union

7

because the board has held that the solicitationof cards by

8

an employer representative is an unfair labor practice» it is

9

coercive and it does not permit of the free choice by

10

employees of their collective bargaining agent.

11

Mow, one must bear in mind that in an R case,

12

under the rules and regulations of the board and under the

13

Labor"Management Relations Act, a representation case is

14

called an investigation and the results are not called a

IS

decision, but a certification and it was interesting to hear

16

the prior case where there was a certification of the results,
And the hearing officer, who would be noted in

17

m

the representation hearing on the magnesium case, said — on

19

page 79 of the record appendixs “As we are in a nonadversary

20

proceeding, a hearing in a representation case is not subject

21

to any rules of evidence „!S

22

102,60,

23

cedure Act, because there is a specific exemption t© Section

24

5 of the certification of employee representatives, but not

23

as to unfair labor practice charges»55

This is in the regulations:

"or to the requirements of the Administrative Pro­

1

The hearing officer is actually one of the staff

z

in a regional offie®f designated by the regional director.

3

He is not appointed under the rules established for -the

4

appointment of hearing officers under the Administrative Pro­

5

cedure Act? and he has no authority t© make recommendations

3

finders of fact, rulers of law, ©r determinations of credi­

7

bility.

8
9

The only reason that a representati.cn case is
handled in this manner is to expedite the processing of elec­

10

tions, and representation matters.

II

under the act, of the Landrum-Griffin Act, which amended the

12

Taft-Hartley Act ©f 1947, Section 3(b) was one ©f the amend­

13

ments which authorised the board to delegate its section 9

14

functions — a section 9 function was only on representation

15

matters, as distinguished from sections that provide unfair

16

labor practice —

17

its representation cases to its regional directors ox retain­

18

ing discretionary powers ©f review.

19

And because, in 1959,

to delegate Section 9 functions only as to

Now, there is no authority for the board to

20

delegate t© a regional director the board9s obligations t© make

21

the findings that ar© required in unfair labor practices

22

brought under Section 10„

23

this more binding, Section 3(b) ©f the amendment said that

24

the board could delegate any of its other powers to a three-

25

man panel of the board.

And, as a matter of fact, to make

gives the board the authority

So the board refused to review the election

21

results, and the union was certified as the bargaining agent,

22

and the company position, having been that the employees were

24

There was no burden

6

You understand it is whether there is a question

7

of representation* but in an unfair labor practice case the

8

burden is on the general counsel to prove by a preponderance

of the evidence that an unfair labor practice exists»

The

10

burden is not on the partyC?) to disprove that there was an

11

unfair labor practice and this is the decision when the board

and it relates to the handling of these C cases.

17

violation subject the Respondent to* and the Petitioner in

13

this case* injunctive penalties *including possible contempt.

19

It requires the board to consider the evidence and to consider

20

the evidence under the rules of evidence of the U. S. District

21

Courts,

Findings of

These rules do not pertain in the representation case.

22

It requires that the board exercise its own in­

23

dependent judgment and under 10 Ce) to make its own findings

24

and conclusions on a preponderance of the evidence taken be­

25

fore it cab enter a bargaining order.

7

1

And of course the Administrative Procedure Act is

2

applicable and this Court has 'so ruled in Nashville Plastics *

3

and that requires that all agency decisions include a state­

4

ment of the findings end conclusions and the reasons or basis

5

therefore on all the material issues of fact and law and

6

discretion presented on the record.

7

Now* when the board's trial examiner issued an

8

order to shew cause after general counsel filed a motion for

9

summary judgment under the unfair practice ease* the employer

10

objected on the basis that the evidence of supervisory status*

n

all of the evidence* should be reviewed by the board or by the

12

trial examiner designated under the rules of the Administrative

13

Procedure Act.

14

And incidentally* just about the time of the issu­

15

ance of this order to show cause on a motion for summary

16

judgment* the employer* Petitioner* learned that the witness

17

Scott*, some ©f whose .testimony had been excepted from the

18

transcript by the regional director relied upon* had admitted

19

after the representation hearing that he had been less than

20

truthful and had withheld information at the representation

2!

hearing.

22

The employer called this to the attention ~

23

Q

How did that develop —

24

A

Beg pardon* sir?

23

Q

How did that develop* Mr. Chandler?
8

1

2

A

It developed because the assistant foreman

told -—

3

Q

1 mean how did it get in the record?

4

A

How did it get in the record?

The Petitioner<

5

Respondent employer at that time, made a motion stating that

6

the witness Scott admittedly had withheld information and

7

requested a reopening of the record, without getting into the

3

details of what the information was®
There was some concern in these rather emotionally

9
10

charged situations as to pressures being brought on witnesses

11

who might subsequently testify end give names -~

12

Q

What did the examiner do about it?

13

A

The examiner said that this doesn’t mean

14

anything t© me®

15

would, it stated in the brief or rather in the record appendix

He said, “You haven’t said anything that

Well, don’t stop your argument now —

18

back.

19

Thank you, sir.

20

The — we asked the opportunity to present facts

21

on the issue®

And the ferial examiner refused t© take evidence

22

or to review the record and he therefore could make no inde­

23

pendent findings of fact or on credibility and he merely

24

affirmed the regional director’s decision on the basis that

25

the board had refused to review®
3

I

The employer filed the exceptions that are re­

2

quired under the act and the board in a short one-page decision

3

really rubber-stamped the trial examiner’s decision who* in

4

turn, rubber-stamped the regional director9s decision and

3

the First Circuit Court who ordered .enforcement
of the bar5

6

gaining order, admitted thatthe issue was a difficult one.

7

used the term BThere are gradations of authority and it is

3

a difficult decision/3 but that they were deferring to the

9

board’s expertise»

10

He

It's interesting, too* because they should have

11

deferred to the board's expertise, but the board's expertise

12

wasn't involved here9 because the board had neglected to

13

perform the duties that were required of it under Section 10«

14

It was the regional director who had mad® some kind of a

13

determination based upon a reading of the transcript*

16

"The portion on request for permission to adduce

17

the evidence, the only construction that I can make ©f

18

Respondent's reply"— this is the trial examiner talking —

«9

"that it viewed Scott's admission as newly discovered evidence*

20

However ~

21

Q

Where are you reading?

22

A

I'm reading on page 164. "Respondent furnishes

23

no support for Ms contention, other than offering to prove in

24

a full hearing that Scott had supervisory authority and did

23

various acts consistent thereto*
10

And he goes on; "And to what

1

extent such evidence is new is impossible to determine other

2

than Scott8s admission which presumably came after the

3

hearing and of which we know nothing.”

4

Well» 1 would ask the ferial examiner how could

3

he know anything about it if we knew nothing about it until

8

after the,'hearing and how could he learn anything about it

7

unless^ since it was newly discovered evidence, he would give

8

us the opportunity to present it.

9

Q

Do you think -the regional director is

10

violating Section 3(b) or the board is, by permitting another

11

person inhis office to hear the evidence and he, himself,

12

just passing on a ~

13

A

Mo, I don't.

The act provides that it be a

14

hearing officer or staff employee.

15

he may make no recommendations and that the regional director

16

will make the decision.

17

it9s really investigatory and it results in ~ certification

18

and it contemplates that ultimately.

19

is that a charge will b© filed and at least this expedites the

20

representation area of the proceeding so that the election

21

can be gotten over with.

22

But it also provides that

But the important aspect of this is

The intent of Congress

And if there are issues they would be raised in a

23

complaint case I say that the board violated the act by

24

adopting the regional director's decision and applying it in

25

the C case without an independent evaluation of facts.
11

i

Q

You don't think that the regional director’s

z

determination is entitled to the same finality as a board

3

determination of representation?

4

A

If it's not appealed ~

S

Q

Let’s assume the board had reviewed the

6

regional director’s representation determination and had

7

reviewed it and determined it and then the company refused

If -there has been an independent review by

13

Q

So your answer is CTnoK?

14

A

The answer is: I would expect to comply with

12

the board —

15

the board’s determination in that case unless there was newly

10

discovered evidence.

17

Q

And s© you say — but you say the regional

18

director’s determination is not entitled to the same finality

19

as -the board’s is on a representation issue?

20

That is right, because there hasn't been an

independent review that applies to the ~

But the section says the regional director

13

is the board for this purpose..

A

Only for the purpose of representation but

14

not for charge

15

must look at all of the evidence.

16

In the motion for review when we said to the employer and they

17

say to any party filing a motion for review? "You prove to

18

us by compelling reasons -that the regional director is wrong,"

19

they shifted the burden that is on them to show by a pre­

20

ponderance of the evidence that an unfair labor practice

21

charge has been committed.

If you have a complaint case the board
They shifted the burden.

There is a difference in the burden that is
required between a representation and a charge.

And the discretion of the board not to take

representation cases d©esnBfe mean very much if they are going

13

1

to have to take them and decide them on the 'anfair labor

10

10 ©f the act requires that in an unfair labor practice case

they must look at the record and that the trial examiner is —•

I mean, the regional director- 1». not the board for unfair

13

labor practise purposes; in representation cases; yes? to

14

process up through to the time of the election.

15

Q

Well* you may well be right.

I was just

16

curious to know why Section 3<i>) didn’t make the regional

n

director determination as final as the board’s.

18

A

As a matter of fact* in the short time remain»

19

ing today I8d like to quote Judge Kaufman’s statement, in the

20

Pepsi-Cola case in the Second Circuit where he says that the

21

board procedure for review under 102.67* which is exactly what

22

we are talking about* is even more cursory than certiorari*

23

since the petition for review must be the self-containing do­

24

cument* cut adrift from the record.

25

In certiorari the record is certified to the higher
14

t

court for examination and for consideration with the petition

2

and the shift of responsibility is improper because there is

3

n© preponderance of evidence required»

4

Q

Are you saying here that there is no possi­

3

bility of review anywhere ©f the regional director's determina­

6

tion if the board chooses not to make it?

7

A

That’s right„ sir.

8

Q

That's what you’re saying?

9

Q

Well, there is always court review.

The

10

Court of Appeals can review the substantial evidence behind

11

the regional director's —

12

A

Not behind — this is what we were going to

get to.
