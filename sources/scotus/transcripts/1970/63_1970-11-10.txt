ARGUMENT OF EDWARD DE GRAZIA, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

6

MR. DE GRAZIA;

7
8

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court;
This case is here on appeal from a judgment of the

9
10

Court of Appeals of Maryland which affirmed an order of the Circ iit

11

Court of Baltimore City upholding a decision by the State Board

12

of Censors disapproving the film I am Curious (Yellow) for

13

exhibition in the State of Maryland.

14

The Maryland film censorship scheme under which I am

15

Curious (Yellow) was banned throughout the state is an amended

16

version of the law which this Court held (without, dissent) to

17

be an unconstitutional "previous restraint" in Freedman v. Mary­

18

land .

19

{

Maryland, in fact, is the only state which still retains

20

a law on its books making criminal the failure of motion pic­

21

ture exhibitors to obtain prior approval by a censorship board

22

of a film intended to be shown to adults.
j

24

25

I am Curious (Yellow) was imported from Sweden by its
American distributor. Grove Press, and it immediately became the'

]
subject of a customs- forfeiture proceeding, but eleven months
2

i

later was finally held to be constitutionally protected and not

2

obscene by the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,
Soon thereafter Appellant 5 V?est Amusement Co., Inc,

contracted with Grove to exhibit I am Curious (Yellow) in

S

Baltimore.

policy the agreement provided that admission to the film would be

7

limited to persons 18 years of age and older, and that Grove

8

would supply all advertising copy.

In accordance with Grove's national distribution

On July 1, 1969, as required by the statute, appellanti

submitted I am Curious (Yellow) to the Maryland Film Censorship

Board, consisting of three adult ladies, who following consul­

12

13

ney General of Maryland, found the film obscene.

15

their identity and their testimony was kept secret.

or supporting reasongs were given by the board in issuing its

17

decision.

As required by the statute, following its disapproval,!

19

the Censorship Board petitioned the Circuit Court of Baltimore

City,.asking it to approve its decision, and after a hearing,

an adversary hearing in which witnesses were heard on both sides!,
the Court affirm the board's decision.
Appellants here appealed that decision to the Court of
Appeals of Maryland, which considered the matter de novo and
found the statute constitutional and the motion picture obscene.

The Maryland Court of Appeals reached its decision

f
a

by a four to three division,, disagreeing sharply over the con™

elusions to be drawn from application to the film of this

Court’s Rofch/Memoirs tests for distinguishing protected expres-

You didn't say that before.

It was a majority of two to one, with Judges

Q

But you emphasized the Maryland court as four

Court of Appeals.
A

In fact, Your Honor, I refer to Judge Lombard's

decision in the case later on.

I think it is notorious that

20

the very rare cases in this field in which there is not a divi­

21

sion of the justices at every level of court that we look at.

22

•

1
The issues presented by this appeal are two-fold.

24

Oh, before I get to the issues, I would like to state |
that in terms of the Court of Appeals of Maryland the majority

25

opinion applied the Roth/Memoirs three-pronged test.

23

4

The Court

1

gave special weight to "the visual impact of a motion picture

2

as contrasted with the printed word."
The issues presented by this appeal are two:

3

First,

4

is the Maryland statute defective as applied to I am Curious

5

(Yellow)?

6

it protected expression?

1

And second, is I am Curious (Yellow) obscenity or is

It is our position that the Maryland film censorship

8

scheme is fatally defective because it is overbroad in acope and

9

because it fails to provide adequate procedural safeguards.

10

The statute requires the board to disapprove any film

11

that is obscene.

12

the statute, however, reaches any film whose effect is to

13

"arouse sexual desires" if that effect probably "outweighs what­

14

ever other merits the film may possess."

15

definition is that it is in conflict with Roth and every other

16

case that has followed.

17

The only definition of "obscene" provided by

The trouble with this

This Court has never to my knowledge suggested thafc

18

books or films may be censored for arousing sexual desires.

19

Any film with a handsome actor might be perceived by lady cen­

20

sors as arousing sexual desires — particularly if the actors

21

appears naked, if only for a few moments as he did in I ant

22

Curious (Yellow).

23
24
25

Similarly, any film starring a nubile woman may be
perceived by a man as arousing sexual desires, particularly if
the actress appears naked, even for a few moments, as she did in
5

. 1

2

I am Curious (Yellow).
Also the statute commands that the arousing effect be

3

weighed against the film8s other values.

4

submitted the statute is in conflict with -this Court's judgment

5

and Mr. Justice Goldberg's opinion, in Jacobellis v. Ohio, and

6

is also in conflict, we submit, with Mr. Justice White's dis­

7

sent in Memoirs v. Massachusetts.

8
9

In this respect it is

Finally, the board is not required by the statute to
consider whether the film goes substantially beyond contemporary

10

community standards in its depictions, as

11

Enterprises v. Day has held must be done before the material can

12

be found obscene.

ship, whereas in the case of the Post Office, which has beer-

22

been described today, a possibly analogous role, the censors

23

deal with other matters than obscenity.

24

25

Q

Mr. de Grazia, am I right that you don’t like the

wording of the statute' in the Maryland Court of Appeals in terms

6

1

of the Roth and Memoirs standards?

2

A

That is correct, Mr. Justice Harlan.

3

Q

So you are not making a — on that basis why

4

the statutes aren't based on something or other material from

5

our standpoint?
A

6

I believe that there have been opinions by jus­

1

tices of this Court, including Mr. Justice Blackmun, to the

8

effect that it may be necessary for the statute itself to define

9

the specificity, the requirements and criterion for censorship.

10

Q

You mean on the chilling effects?

11

A

In the case of Aptheker

v. Secretary of State,

12

which is cited in our brief at page 44, the Court I think clearly

13

held that the courts are not unlimited in the authority to

14

rewrite otherwise defective statutes.
Q

15

Well, I say the Supreme Court is so far as is

16

required.

We just take the statutes as ‘brown" and the State

\7

Court says that really means "green," then the state law is that

m

it means "green" and that's the way we fake it.
A

19
HO

that.

21

way.

22

in the law.

23

Q

24

25

Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, it may be that you do

I am not sure the censorship board would take it that,
The ladies on the censorship board are not, I think, trained
There is not indication that ——
But here we have the Maryland Court of Appeals,

the highest State Court.
A

Yes, Your Honor, but we are here dealing also
7

1

with the censorship system which requires the prior submission

z

and the suppression by a board, an administrative board, of

3

material which only later is judicially adjudicated for its

4

obscenity»

5

Q

Well, let's assume that the first action was

&

inadequate in some way.

7

Appeals of Maryland had taken its steps?

Q
9

A

Was it irrelevant after the Court of

Mr. Chief Justice, if this statute permitted this

film or any film, at least any film that had been the subject

10

of a prior positive judicial action to remain free for exhibi­

11

tion during the pendency of the board's hearing and the legal

12

proceedings thereafter, I would say "yes."

13

that is the teaching of this Court that censorship boards are

14

free to reach erroneous conclusions through inadequate practices

15

The proceedings are subject to the saving grace of a final judi-’

16

cial decision, which as is perfectly plain in this case is more

17

than a year after the film was originally suppressed and run.

18

But I don't believe

I would like to further point out the teaching of

:

19

Kingsley Books v. Brown in which the Court held material ought

20

to be permitted to circulate pending the final judicial decisioni

21

subject only to a subsequent contempt proceedings.

22
23
24
25

j

Again! wish*

to emphasise that in cases such as this where the film is already
known to the censorship board and known to the courts, the film j
already had been held constitutionally protected by the Second
Court of Appeals.

j
8

!

Surely in a case such as this there is no sufficient

2

warrant for a board or court to suppress the exhibition of a

3

film pending the final adjudication by this Court.

4

My second point is I am Curious (Yellow) cannot be

5

held to be obscene, when any of this Court’s tests are used.

6

Q

What inference do you want us to draw, if any,

7

from the fact a Federal Court of three judges held one way and

8

a State Supreme Court held another way?

9

more than reasonable men take a different view of some of these

10

Does that prove anything

things?

11

A

Mr. Chief Justice,

12

Q

You are not suggesting that the Second Circuit’s

3

~

holding is binding upon the Court of Appeals of Maryland, are

14

you?

15

'

A

I suggest that in the area, sir, as difficult

IS

as this one is that the Court of Appeals of Maryland indeed and

17

the Circuit Court of Baltimore should have heeded — should

18

not have follov/ed the decision by the Second Circuit Court of

19

Appeals, but should have seen as a matter of law that if a

20

majority of the High Federal Bench sees social importance in a

21

film, sees on insufficient prurient appeal and insufficient

22

patent sensitiveness in the film, that surely the film cannot

23

be said to be utterly without social importance, without vio­

24

lence.

25

It seems to me that a decision by any judge, any justice
9

I

of a Federal or state court should be enough to warn another

2

away from a decision which suppresses a film.

3

In Roth this Court said that obscenity was not protected

4

expression, but in doing so the Court emphasized that sex is not

5

synonymous with obscenity.

e

in art, literature and scientific works, is not sufficient raaso,

7

this Court said, "to deny material the constitutional protection

8

of speech and press."

"The portrayal of sex, for example,

That reasoning, we feel, precisely covers this case.

9
10

I am Curious (Yellow) is too hours of filmed art.

Dozens of

1?

witnesses and critics proved that, were it not otherwise perfect!

12

clear from the viewing of this film,

13

of ten minutes of sexual relations cannot taken to destroy the

14

film's entitlement to constitutional protection.

The portrayal in this film

The relationship of the sexual episodes to the balance

15

IS

of the film was described at the trial axid is contained in our

17

brief on the merits at footnote 32.
I would like to read to you one sentence of what Mr.

18
19

Vincent Canby of the New York Times said on this point;

"A full-

2©

length portrait of the Lena, the trouble, liberated, woman, simply

21

could not exist without these sexual scenes."
As Judge Hays said in the Second Circuit decision, "Whit

22
23

ever the dominant theme may be said to be, it is certainly not

24

sex.

25

Moreover, not only is the sexual theme subordinate, but it

is handled in such a way as to make it at least extremely doubtful
10

s

that interest in it should be characterized as 3 pruriente.8"

2

The conclusion that this film is constitutionally

3

protect plainly follows from this Court3s decisio® subsequent

4

to Roth,
I would wish to mention at this juncture two important

3
6

facts about the Roth/Memoirs test.

7

the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography's recent report*

8

and I must quote this to you* “The three-part definition adopted

8

in the plurality opinion in the Fanny Hill case" is the version

10

which has been codified into a number of state statutes and "is

1!

the one which is almost universally used in state and lower Federal

12

courts."

13

First* as was documented by

Second* the judgments required by Memoirs "are enormously

14

difficult to make with regard to particular materials and it is

IS

very easy for different judges and jurors to reach opposite con­

16

clusions as to the same works,"

17

The recommendations of the Commission are that all

18

laws which prohibit or interefere with consensual distribution

19

of "obscene" materials to adults should be repealed* and that*

20

as this Court has intimated in such decisions as Redrup and

21

Stanley and Rowan v. Post Office* only laws aimed at the protec-;

22

tion of juveniles or at the prevention of obtrusive or assaultive

23

communications to unwilling or captive adults are consistent

24

with theconstitutional values of free expression,

25

Q

Are you going to devote any more time to the
11

1

argument that the Chief Justice inquired about, namely, what the

2

impacts of the Second Circuit's decision should be?

3

I understood your brief to argue that in the First

4

Amendment field, not as a matter of res adjudicata, but as a

5

matter of giving protective effect to either supremacy matter

6

or the preemption matter and to relieve people in this field

7

from the threat of different kinds of decisions from state court

8

and then being given by the Federal Courts, that the first Federal

9

decision is a matter of supremacy law or preemption law, which

10

should be controlling.
A

Well, that is our position.

12

Q

You are not going to argue that any more?

13

A

Perhaps X can say a few more words about it.

14

Q

Well, X thought it was quite an interesting

11

15
16
17

IS
19

20
21

22
23

argument myself.
A

It seems to me that this field already replete

with conflicting decisions, conflicting rules, overlapping tests
could be improved \ ere state courts to learn the courtesy or
supremacy to the judgments of Federal Courts in this area.

I

would think that the Federal Courts might similarly respect the
prior judgments of state courts at least if the state courts
are applying the correct standards.
But there is no suggestion in the Maryland Court of

24

Appeals decision that the Second Circuit Court had applied

25

standards different from those which Maryland chose to apply.
12

1

In such situations, it seems to me, that the prior judicial

z

decision could be treated as, in effect, binding on the second

3

court o

11

Q

Would you carry that beyond- the First Amendment

in all areas of the adjudication of the Federal Constitution?
A

Mr. Justice Harlan, I wouldn't»

1 haven't inves­

tigated that matter, but I doubt that I would.
Q

Suppose the Second Circuit had gone the other

way with Judge Friendly resolving his distrusting doubt the
other way, would you make the same argument?
A

If, Mr. Justice Blackmun, the Second Circuit

12

Court of Appeals had ruled differently, we would have appealed

13

the decision to this Court.

14

case and I had every confidence that this Court would have

15

reversed the Second^Circuit Court of Appeals.

And I had been involved in that

16

I think that we should —

17

Q

18
19
20
21

Well, keep in mind suppose some other counsel

had handled it and didn't appeal.
A

Mr. Justice Blackmun, I am sure that any compe­

tent counsel in that case would have appealed to this Court.
I want to emphasise a point with which the Commission

22

on Pornography, it seems to me, is doubly persuasive, and that

23

is in this area where is a doubt, the expression should be per­

24

mitted to continue and to exist, and doubt should be resolved

25

in favor of the expression and of the decisions upholding the
13

1

expression because there is absolutely no evidence'of social

2

danger to individuals or to society from the chills of the time

3

which are suppressed by statutes like this.

4

I mention the Commission’s report today not because

S

its findings are.necessary to support our side.

6

The Roth/Memoirs testss and in the alternative the Kingsley

7

Books v. Bromm and Freedman eases# are all the law we believe we

8

need for reversal.

9

They are not.

However, the report is unquestionably the most important

10

and authoritative commentary in this field of obscenity to have

!?

appeared since the American Lav? Institute’s draft of a Model

12

Penal Code, and I have no doubt that you will have reference to

13

it in the event you should decide on clearer definitions or

14

tests should be introduced in this or related cases.

15

I wish to point out that in my judgment this case and

IS

this film provide the Court with a rare opportunity to reach

17

a judgment that is unanimous# and announce a clear and uniform.

|

18

opinion which might significantly relieve this Bench and lower

j

19

state and Federal courts as well of the floor! of litigation and

20

conflicting decisions which have been the inevitable prices paid:

21

for the disagreements between the members of this Bench# and

22

for tests which fail adequately to be in touch -with the realifciei
]

23
24
25

of sexual attitudes# behavior and expression.
I therefore suggest the Court, might wish to go beyond
a reversal of Maryland on the basis of Roth/Memoirs or Brown/

14

1

Freedman, and reverse on the basis of a new formulation which

2

finds its common rationale in a distillation of the wisdom of

3

the opinions of Mr, Justice Harland in Manual Enterprises, Mr»

4

Justice Brennan in Memoirs, Mr„ Justice Stewart's opinion in

5

Ginzburg and Mishkin, the per curiam opinion in Redrup, Mr.

6

Justice White’s opinion in Memoirs, Mr. Justice Marshall's opinion

7

in Stanley, and the Chief Justice's opinion in Rowan.

8

Q

What is the rule you just -- (laughter)

9

A

Yes, the rule, Mr. Justice Harlan, is that

10

Federal agencies and courts would be admonished not to obstruct

11

or interfere with disseminations of films or any other material

12

unless they are hard-core pornography, but they would be given

13

leeway to prevent or prosecute these whenever the mode of their

14

distribution carries with it the risk of exposure to unwilling

15

adults or to children.

16

Here may I remind you that general commercial motion

17

picture distribution generally carry far fewer such risks than

18

books.

19

That is exposure to children or to unwilling adults.
Your Honors all have had an opportunity to see this

20

film* and to have experienced its dominating concern with

21

political and social and moral values, its exploration of per­

22

sonal and national ethics of violence and nonviolence, or criti­

23

cism of American, Swedish, Russian, Chinese and Spanish Govern­

24

ments, of youthful reactions to the war in Vietnam and the aspir a-

25

fcion for a country which could adopt a policy of nonviolent

15

1

defense., of the ideals of Martin Luther King, of the irrespon­

2

sibility of some parents and the anger of their children.

3

We have furnished the Court with copies of the film's

4

scenario so that you may be able, if you desire, to refresh your

5

recollection of the film's social theme and intellectual ideas,

You don"t want to make that one, too, do you, while you are at

Mr. Justice Marshall, we mentioned that we touch

them in our brief on the merits.

Yes, Mr. Justice Black.

Q

Why are the people of the other nine states

I believe entirely because of litigation which

been suspended pending the decision of this Court in this case.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Attorney General.

ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS B. BURCH, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE

21

22

MR. BURCH:

23

I would make apologies at the outset if I have a

24
25

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:

question put to me and 1 have a little difficulty hearing it,
and I just simply want to apologize in advance.
18

1

1 had originally intended to argue this case by

2

addressing myself, first, to the obscenity issue and then very

3

lightly at the end to the questions raised by my brother with

4

respect to the statute itself, the whole system of pre-censorship

5

in Maryland and the question of preemption by the Second Circuit.

6

But let me, since he made quite a point of both of

7

those matters — let me first, if X may, go to the question of

8

the other buts of the Maryland statutes.

9

Stewart, you pointed out that the Court of Appeals in the

1 believe, Mr. Justice

10

Sansa case addressed itself specifically to that problem and

11

held that obscenity was obscenity within the constitutional

12

sense, and that was all that could be banned by the Maryland

13

Board of Censors.

14

And 1 might say that brings to mind the Shuttlesworth

15

case in Alabama, where this Court held that plastic 3urgery

16

on a statute which was otherwise be in violation of First Amend­

17

ment rights could act prospectively so that the surgery would

18

correct whatever defect there was.

IS

20

But we think Shuttlesworth is a complete answer to the
point raised by my brother on that question.

21

With respect to the preemption, again going to the

22

question of the statute itself, my brother refers to the Kings­

23

ley case, the Brown case.

24

1957.

25

Maryland system of pre-censorship, was decided in 1965 and it is

I simply point out that that was in

The Freedman case, which dealt specifically with the

19

1

very much on point, so I don’t know why he would ask this Court,

2

having once addressed itself to the Maryland statute, having

3

found that it could constitutionally be amended — and it was

4

so amended — that now he brings up the Brown case of 1957.

5

On the. question of preemption by the Second Circuit,

0

first of all we have an. entirely different situation.

7

be a completely new theory of the law.

8

find nothing which would suggest that preemption would be appro­

9

priate in this particular case.

10

But let’s look at the points.

It would

In fact, we assert we

First of all, we ware

n

not party to the Federal suit in New York.

There was no expert

12

witness offered by the Federal Government.

The case was tried

13

before a jury.

14

if a court in some other jurisdiction were to decide the issue

15

without our having had any opportunity whatever to enforce the

16

rights of our statutes, that we should be preempted.

17
18
19

Vie had no right of appeal, so we would say that

I think such is a question for the states to answer.
I don't believe this Court will ever take such a position.
Now let me get to the question about obscenity, the

20

description that, my brother had given of the sex in this picture.

21

He talked about a few fleeting moments of a man in the nude and

22

a girl, in the nude.

23

pornography, even under the unusual circumstance that he suggests,

24

that hard-core pornography would be properly banned by any

25

jurisdiction, whether it be Federal or.state.

He says that he acknowledges that hard-core

20

1

1 would like, if the Court is not already familiar

2

with it, simply to refer to the description of the 17 — in the

3

—• pardon me for just a minute, I would like to find the par­

4

ticular reference- to What this film is all about»
While I look for that, I would like to make one fur­

5

@

ther comment about the theme of this movie.

There was some

7

very interesting characterizations of the various things, about

8 Martin Luther King, the unrest in Sweden and this and the other
9

thing and thcit this, therefore, gave it "redeeming social value."

10

I think it is interesting, if the Court will recall,

1!

in our brief the reference to Rex Reed's critiques, I think in

12

the Hew York Timest in which he related a very interesting

13

incident when the film had been shown to those who were going to

14

writs it, the critics, that after the film had been shown it

15

was found out that the projectionist had put the second reel —

18

the third reel second and the second reel last.

17

the theme was so completely disorganised and there wasn't really

18

any theme.

19

In other words,

They didn't know which film want where.
And if you will look at Judge Lumbard's opinion in the

20

New York case, you will find that they did the same thing when

21

that film was exhibited to the Court and the jury, because in

22

his opinion Judge Lumbard says, "The final scene in conformity

23
24
25

to the dominant theme shows the female lead performing an
orchiectomy or peotomy, or both, on her murdered lover with a
kitchen carvi.ng knife."

21

1

This happened to be in. the second reel and not the

a

third reel, but when they showed it to the jury and the Court,

3

it ended up by being in the third reel.

4

Now let's look at what sex is in this movie.

5

not going to use some of the expressions that were used, such as

6

in the opening scene when the young lady tells about what she

7

can do in Rio de Janeiro for free, but you have an erotic dis­

8

play of Indian sculpture depicting a man with his hand on the

9

woman's vagina.

You have a discussion between Lena and another

girl about different methods of masturbation.
You have the dialogue, "Are you that *

Also, you don't give a you-knoW-what about it.

14

completely naked, exposing the male genital area, showing attempted

intercourse standing against a wall and also a scene of Bttrje

caressing the girl's breasts with his tongue.

17
18

There is a

There is a scene depicting sexual intercourse between
Bdrje and Lena on the palace balustrate in which, although the

19

parties are clothed, the act of intercourse is vividly displayed.

20

Also we see scenes of nudity at the retreat and scenes depicting

21

Lena looking at a sex manual showing various unusual positions

22

for sexual intercourse.

23

There is a scene at the retreat showing Bdrje throwing

24

Lena to the ground and committing an act of cunnilingus, followed

25

by a scene depicting the parties both completely nude with Lena
22

kissing Bdrje’s penis as he caresses her vagina.

There is a

12

appears to be intercourse in the nude.
Throughout this picture you have 10 or 12 minutes of

The sex is used to sell the film.

10

There has been

The rest of it is

11

nothing.

The I am Curious (Yellow) case, this picture was

12

developed by a series of infcerviei^s such as you see Lena con­

13

ducting on the street and what-not.

14

they extracted from it that which they wanted to put in I am

15

Curious (Yellow), which was about 90 percent of the sex scenes

16

they filmed.

17

(Yellow).

They took all of that and

They put that together and they sold I am Curious

Then they came along with I ara Curious (Blue) and what

18
19

a disappointment to those who were looking for sex, because it

20

reminded me of the comment by Mr. Justice Stewart or Mr. Justice

21

Goldberg, who said, in the Jacobeliis case, that the sex was

22

so fleeting that you wouldn't have known unless you had been a

23

censor.

24
25

In this case this is exactly what they did and they
ended up with I am Curious -- and what happened?

Along came I am Curious (Blue) with no sex, the same type of

7

interviews, the same depiction of unjust social matters and this

8

and the other thing, and what happens?

9

weeks it has fallen flat on its face and I doubt very seriously

10

that it is being shown in any other state in the country today.

Why?

15

If it had the sex that I am Curious

So, this now gets me to the part of the argument of

16

addressing myself to what is the state of the law oh this whole

17

question, and I agree it is confusing.

18

difficult to read the opinions in these cases.

19

make a summary of what each of the justices in the 15 years has

20

done in the various cases and quite frankly, and X say it with

21

some apology, there is really no complete consistency among the

22

views of the justices and among some of the justices8 own views.

23

I agree that it is very
I have tried to

They say one thing one time and they say one thing

24

another time, and they come back and they end up with a somewhat

25

different view from what they even had the second time.
25

1

Again I say it with an apology, but this is really the

2

problem, and I think the Court recognizes the problem.

3

the Court sees that it has to resolve the problem.

4

I think

Now throughout the country today all the courts are

5

viewing the whole question of obscenity with the three-pronged

©

test as being the applicable test.

7

on the subject and I have yet to find where a majority of the

8

courts has - agreed on the three-pronged test, or the majority of

9

any court has agreed on the three-pronged test.

Well, 1 have read every case

10

Mr. Justice Brennan introduced the three-pronged

If

test in. Memoirs and he came out i^ith the " social], y utterly

12

social redeeming values."

13

the court that has subscribed to this as the viable concept and

14

the principle which shall be applied in decisions such as this.

15

But there hasn't been a majority of

What is the test?

I think the answer is what Mr.

16

Justice Harlan has suggested, and which 1 believe has been

17

generally adopted by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Blackmun

18

and to a somewhat lesser extent by Mr. Justice White, and that

19

is that you have got to let the states use a rational basis in

20

making a determination.

21

whether it is obscene and whether it is in violation of that

22

particular statute.

23

We have got to- let the states determine

This is the only way we are going to make any sense

24

out of it and it is the only way we are going to end up the

25

clogging of the courts with these cases corning in day in and

26

1

day out all over the United States, whether we are talking about

2

Federal courts or whether we are talking about state courts,

3

whether we are talking at the lower level or whether we are

4

talking at the appellate level.
We have today the biggest backlog of cases in the crimi­

S
6

nal field throughout all the courts in the United States, and

7

because of the inability of the court to determine with some

8

reasonable definition of what constitutes “obscenity," the

9

states have a right to control — because of that we are causing

10

all of these criminals or those who have been charged with

11

criminal acts to languish in jail, waiting for these other cases

12

to be tried.
Quite frankly, I know that some will criticize me for

13
14
15
16

18
1©

what I am about to say, but I would rather see the whole law
abolished than to have this state of confusion continue»
this serves no good purpose,

I think

I think, however, that the public

has a right, based on the acts of the Legislature, to have some
protection in the field of obscenity,

I think this Court has

said that it has to.
It has also said that obscenity is not entitled to the

20
21

protection of the First Amendment,

22

believe it would be a sad day if it is ever the view of this

23

Court that obscenity can run rampant and nobody can do anything

24

about it.

25

I believe it is correct,

Can’t you just stick with

I am not saying I want you to straighten anything

up other than this particular matter, Mr. Justice,
Q

Just this one point.

And you are suggesting,

12

as I understand, that the state court wants to decide it, but

13

you haven't mentioned what standard the state court would apply.

14

That is my question.

15

A

I would say, like we have in the trial of crimi­

16

nal cases, that if there is sufficient evidence, as I believe

17

Mr. Chief Justice Warren suggested — that is'there is suffi-

18

cient — and I believe it is the view of Mr. Justice Harlan and

19

Mr. Chief Justice Burger and Mr. Justice Blackmun and it might

20

very well be Mr. Justice White's view, that I .think that if

that is established, at least we could caress unless there is

clear air, unless there is a substantial amount of evidence to

And with all due respect again to this
This Court puts itself in

But that is what this Court is; it is a "super-censor.
And as long as you are going to be a "super-censor,"

you are going to end up by having yourself completely choked
