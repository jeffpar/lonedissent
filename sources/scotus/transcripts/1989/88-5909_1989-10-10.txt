MR. HUNTER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice , and may it

This case is before the Court on certiorari for the

11

Supreme Court of North Carolina to review the Supreme Court of

12

North Carolina's decision affirming Dock McKoy•s death

sentence.

14

in that trial, and whether those instructions violated the

15

Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

16

This case is about the penalty phase instructions

At the penalty phase trial in that case, the court

17

instructed the jury that it must be unanimous to find a

mitigating circumstance, and that if the jury was not

Mr. Hunter, is it your position that the

Constitution requires the state to prove lack of mitigating

circumstances?

16

KR. HUNTER:

No, Your Honor.

No, it is not.

It is

17

simply our position that it is unconstitutional to allow one

18

juror to preclude the rest of the jurors from considering

19

mitigating circumstances at -- at the penalty, at the final

20

sentencing stage.

MR. HUNTER :

No , I think it may be addressed to the

that fact truly unanimously.

21

here is -- as I understood the dissent in Mills, for example,

22

scheme where the jury had to be unanimous to find or to reject

They had to agree.

And on that basis the

In the North Carolina scheme, on the other hand, and as

that is, to unfind it or to reject that mitigating

understanding, you say that the jury has to be unanimous.

Unless there is some rule of less than unanimous.
MR. HUNTER:

9

And again, our, Your Honor, our problem,

10

the unconstitutionality in North Carolina, does not have to do

11

with requiring the jury to be unanimous to find mitigation.

12

It is allowing them to reject that mitigation by only one

13

juror.

14

Maryland really illustrate the problem that also exists in

15

North Carolina.

16

that were suggested there was that 11 jurors could believe

17

that there was mitigation in the case, be convinced of it by a

preponderance of the evidence, Your Honor, and yet one juror

could say I am not convinced by a preponderance of the

evidence.

Because we

don't think the cure for that is to allow black ball of

6

I

You know, the -- the requirement that the jury be

more step, where the jury must determine unanimously and

by the jury -- or factors found by the jury to exist, is

sufficiently substantial to warrant imposition of the death

the extent we can, the issues that we're trying to deal with

by these sentences -- by these -- these evidentiary rules, are

to ensure that one person doesn't get the death penalty on the

The jury, after hearing an individual's evidence, by

having this -- this standard, and if we are going to have

aggravation found by this standard, the need for symmetry is

such that we do need this type of rule, the jury, after

MRS. BYERS:

argument about how old the person is?
MR. HUNTER:

If 11 believe that the -- the defendant's

age is mitigating, and only one doesn't -QUESTION:

No, no.

No, no.

There is a fight over - -

11

there is a dispute as to how old he is.

12

in this Court, by the way.

13

MR. HUNTER:

Is that

And that has happened
is it wrong then to - -

I would still -- I think that's what was

14

held in -- in Mills, Your Honor, that allowing one juror to

15

decide for the 11 -- other 11 -- because in Mills, this second

16

level was not there.

17

The jury was only finding facts --

19

QUESTION:

19

MR. HUNTER:

In Mills they were only finding facts.

Historical facts, yes.
Yes.

And this Court held, in -- in Mills,

20

that that was the height of arbitrariness, to let one person

21

essentially veto facts for the others.

22

QUESTION:

I did want to

Well, what if it comes out seven to five?

23

Are you -- are you going to let seven people veto facts for

24

the other five?

25

MR. HUNTER:

Well, I would say -- my personal belief is

no, that still wouldn't be constitutional, because they could

be preclusion, but it is seven times less arbitrary than the

3

system we have in North Carolina now.

4

As to the question about what the jury does with

5

question 4, Justice, I wanted to be sure and point out that in

6

North Carolina it is very clear in question 4 the only thing

7

that jury can consider is the mitigating circumstances that

8

were found, not the whole case.

review of the entire case.

10

They are not doing a -- a

On page 73 of the Joint Appendix, at the top of the

11

page, the North Carolina Supreme Court says it then allows the

12

jury to consider only that evidence which is relevant, which

13

in North Carolina's definition of the word is that evidence

14

which the jury has unanimously found, in sentencing the

15

defendant.

16

QUESTION:

Yes, but, apparently the jury is instructed

17

that if there are no mitigating circumstances and there are

18

aggravating circumstances, that they still have to determine

19

whether those aggravating circumstances are sufficiently

20

substantial to justify giving the death penalty.

21

another layer of decision.

22

MR. HUNTER:

That is true.

There is

There is another layer, but

23

it is only a reconsideration of the aggravating circumstances

24

that were found, plus if any mitigating circumstances were

25

found, consideration of those.

This Court has never held that

because we are very solicitous about the consideration of

2

aggravation, for instance in Sumner and Roberts are two cases

that -- that occur to me, we have never held that because, no

that excuses the exclusion of mitigating evidence.
