ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN I. HOROWITZ

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. HOROWITZ:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case involves two different bankruptcy

12

court disputes that were consolidated on appeal in the

13

First Circuit.

14

bankruptcy courts erred in ordering the IRS to apply the

15

periodic payments of priority taxes that are required

16

under a Chapter 11 reorganization plan, applying those

17

payments first to satisfy the debtor corporation's trust

18

fund tax liability.

19

liability for which the corporation's responsible officers

20

are separately and personally liable.

21

They present a single issue:

whether the

That is, the withholding tax

This order prevents the IRS from applying any of

22

these periodic payments to the corporation's other,

23

nontrust fund tax liabilities, for which there is no other

24

source of collection, until the trust fund liability is

25

completely satisfied.

In the absence of this court order,

1

the IRS would apply the periodic payments in the reverse

2

manner, in accordance with its usual practice.

3

As the court of appeals frankly acknowledged —

4

QUESTION:

Is there some basis in law for the

5

IRS allocation?

6

it -- they permit the taxpayer to do it with voluntary

7

payments.

8
9

MR. HOROWITZ:

12

That's — the IRS has a policy of

permitting the taxpayers to designate —

10
11

They say they have the right to allocate

QUESTION:

Well, is there some basis in law for

that?
MR. HOROWITZ:

There is no, there is no legal

13

provision that directs the IRS how to allocate, either

14

voluntary or involuntary or any other kind of payment.

15

this policy pretty much comes out of common sense.

16

pretty much the same way --

voluntarily, rather than requiring the IRS to go to court

I'm sorry, we can't accept the limitation, but if you

don't accept the limitation you don't accept the payment.

MR. HOROWITZ:

QUESTION:

5

Your Honor, that's —

You consider these to be involuntary

payments?
MR. HOROWITZ:

6

Well, in this case these are

7

involuntary payments.

Justice Scalia asked me about

8

voluntary payments, I think.

I am just answering that.

9

That is true, the taxpayer can then withdraw the

10

payment, and the IRS would then have to go to court to get

11

it.

12

more power.

13

It can also take administrative action and prefers not to

14

do that.

15

So the situation is similar.

The IRS has a little

It doesn't have to go to court, excuse me.

So, as a practical common sense way of

16

administering the tax laws in the same practical common

17

sense way that private debtors and creditors deal with it,

18

the IRS accepts these designations.

19

perfectly reasonable thing to do, whether it is required

20

to do so by law, by something that is implicit in the

21

Code, maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

22

MR. HOROWITZ:

Our position here is that the

going to allocate payments.

No reason for the

But do you think there is some legal

10

-- some legal basis that you argue that the bankruptcy

11

court was wrong, namely that it should have -- it should

12

have preserved your right to get at this — at the

13

officers?

14

MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, we are — we do argue,

15

which I plan to explain in more detail a little bit later,

16

that there are a lot of policies that are embodied both in

17

the Internal Revenue Code and the Bankruptcy Code that --

18

with which there is at least some tension with what the

19

bankruptcy court did here.

that either permits or forbids the bankruptcy court from

2

voluntary and involuntary, or where one looks for that

distinction, except you invite us to look to what the IRS

has done in the past.

is voluntary, and it is involuntary where the IRS says it

MR. HOROWITZ:

And you seem to assert that we

I think the IRS' own policy is

10

just tied to the will of the IRS.

1

MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, I think to the extent that

2

some of the bankruptcy courts in this area have fought

3

over what the IRS' policy is, I think you are right.

4

That's the wrong place to fight the battle.

5

policy is that this is involuntary, and as far as --

All the lower courts upheld that

conclusion, didn't they, that —

MR. HOROWITZ:

All the courts of appeals have.

There are some bankruptcy courts —

10

QUESTION:

That these were involuntary payments.

11

MR. HOROWITZ:

12

QUESTION:

Yes, that is correct.

Then the question we granted

13

certiorari on is whether the authority of the bankruptcy

14

court to allocate tax payments under these circumstances.

15

MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, that's true.

Just to

16

finish the point, it's a very sterile inquiry as to

17

whether this is the IRS' policy or not.

18

clearly it is, but if it isn't, if the court somehow takes

19

the view that the IRS is misapplying its own policy and

20

doesn't know what it means by the distinction that it has

21

drawn, then I imagine the IRS will probably clarify that,

22

I mean, we think

And I think the real issue here is whether there

23

is some law, either the common law, and we think there is

24

nothing that has been suggested as any common law bar to

25

it, or whether there is something in the bankruptcy

payments which it receives, becomes its money on its

ability to collect.

QUESTION:

Mr. Horowitz, did the bankruptcy

6

court have the power to approve these plans over the

7

objections of the IRS?

8
9

MR. HOROWITZ:

The bankruptcy court is required

under Section 1129 — Section 1129 sets forth a lot of

10

requirements for confirmation of a plan, and the

11

bankruptcy court can only confirm a plan if it meets those

12

requirements.

QUESTION:

So, the bankruptcy court can overrule

Does the IRS have an express policy

18

in its manual to the effect that it will comply with

19

orders of the bankruptcy court?

20

MR. HOROWITZ:

Absolutely.

We will comply with

21

the order of the bankruptcy court, but we reserve the

22

right to appeal it, which is what we have done here.

23

if we lose this case in the Supreme Court we will abide by

24

the designation.

for the prior allocation of these payments to the ordinary

2

tax liability.

3

MR. HOROWITZ:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. HOROWITZ:

To the trust fund tax liability.

Yes.
Yes.

Well, what happened in the

6

Energy Resources case was that the — one of the

7

requirements of Section 1129 is that all of the priority

8

taxes, which includes both components here, have to be

9

paid in full over, within a six-year period.

So, when the

10

first payment was made in that case, the debtor sent a

11

letter saying we would like these payments to be applied

12

first to the non — excuse me, to the trust fund taxes.

13

And the IRS wrote back and said well, we're not going to

14

do that unless you get a court order.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. HOROWITZ:

17

Yes.
And then they went and got a

claimed that the bankruptcy court does not have the

2

authority to require us how to — remember, what the

3

bankruptcy court has done here is — there is no question

4

that the money is being paid to the IRS.

5

then is how the, once it becomes the IRS' money, how the

6

IRS is going to deal with it on its books, which liability

QUESTION:

8

9
10

The question

You mean the question is whether it

becomes the IRS' money, until the IRS agrees to accept it
in the manner in which is it offered.
MR. HOROWITZ:

11

Well, that I think is the

12

difference between what everyone agrees is a voluntary

13

payment and what we have here, because under Section 1129

14

there is no plan, unless the IRS — these payments are

15

made to the IRS.

16

the payments if the IRS says we are not going to designate

17

them the way you want, then it's just too bad for the

18

debtor.

19

The debtor has no discretion not to make

He has no choice.
QUESTION:

(Inaudible).

If we were to rule against you in

20

this case, would the IRS in future reorganizations have

21

the capacity to object to a plan and block a

22

reorganization on the grounds that it objected to the

allocation?

We can

In other words, as a creditor it

could not object to the approval of the plan?
MR. HOROWITZ:

6

That is right.

The IRS, as long

7

as the requirements for payment of taxes that are

8

specified in the statute are satisfied, if the plan

9

complies with that, then the IRS can't object.

And if

10

there are, as in this case we contend, if there is no

are a lot of rights that the IRS has in that trust fund as
long as it exists.

In fact, as long as the trust fund can

be identified prior to bankruptcy, those funds don't go
into the estate at all.
QUESTION:

That's right.

But what's happened here is that

the trust funds have completely been dissipated by the
officers.

There is no way of identifying any trust funds

And Congress has given the same priority to

QUESTION:

Well, the court of appeals ruled that

the equitable power of the bankruptcy court included the
power to prefer the restoration or the payment of these
trust fund taxes first.
MR. HOROWITZ:

That is what the court of appeals

held, incorrectly in my view.
QUESTION:

Were these monies generated after the

petition was filed or before the petition was filed?
MR. HOROWITZ:

The payments that are being made?

Not the payments, the money that is

being used to make the payments.

QUESTION:

— under your theory in this other

MR. HOROWITZ:

Yes.

And if that happened, of

14

course, then the plan would only be paying out the

15

nontrust fund taxes and we would be getting paid those

16

taxes at the very beginning, instead of being pushed off

17

effectively to the very back end of the plan, which is

18

what is happening here.

19

As the court of appeals said at page 3(a) of its

opinion, the only thing that turns on this dispute is who

The designation provision that the court imposed

here works to the advantage of these officers at the

expense of the government.

QUESTION:

You said the designation provision

which the court imposed.

6

MR. HOROWITZ:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. HOROWITZ:

9

You mean the bankruptcy court?
Yes, I mean the bankruptcy court.

And how would you describe it?
The bankruptcy court ordered the

IRS to apply the payments that it receives first to all of

10

the trust fund liability of the corporation.

11

after the trust fund liability has been completely

12

satisfied, which in turn completely eliminates the

13

separate liability of the officers, because the IRS only

14

collects those liabilities once, only then can the IRS go

15

and apply any of the payments to the nontrust fund

16

liabilities.

17

QUESTION:

But these payments are being made out

18

of the bankruptcy estate, right?

That is correct.

court does is it confirms the plan of reorganization.

then the debtor continues to operate the company within

the parameters of the plan.

He is also, I am not sure he would be paying the

I am saying — I am

QUESTION:

Well, it could.

I mean, the argument

going business may turn in part on the agreement of how

18

these taxes are to be allocated. And

The only thing that the court of appeals seized

on here was the notion that the responsible officers would

try to negotiate their personal liability away by

threatening to do various things to the debtor, maybe to

force it into liquidation, if the IRS doesn't — if they

10

are not able to get what is basically a personal

11

accommodation from the IRS in discharging their liability.

12

Now that is not the IRS' fault.

14

That is the responsible

And I would say a few things about that.

One,

15

we really think it is very inappropriate for the

bankruptcy court to kind of become an accomplice in this

17

scheme where the responsible officers take the

18

government's money and then threaten the vitality of the

19

reorganization in order to get out from under their

20

liability.

21

Secondly, the idea of Chapter 11 is that there,

22

is to give the corporation a chance to keep going as a

23

going concern.

right now.
MR. HOROWITZ:

2

Well, I don't know if the debtor

3

has an action against the officers or not, but the problem

4

with the IRS going after the officers directly is that the

5

officers can string out the litigation for quite a while

6

by posting a bond, litigating it, et cetera, et cetera.

7

It will take a while for the government to collect from

8

the officers.
During this time in which they are trying to

9
10

collect from the officers, the payments out of the

11

organization plan will be being applied to the

12

corporation's liability under provision of the plan and

13

reducing the officers separate liability.

necessarily a useful remedy for the IRS to go after the

officers.

this.

benefit of Section 1141, the assets have revested in the

control over and custody of the funds, the taxpayer makes

But it is true that the cases have focussed

6
7

upon, to some measure, what takes place during the course

of the Chapter 11.

13

Scalia pointed out, the debtor always lacks options to pay

involuntary taxes.

15

the law says they arise under certain circumstances.

16

yet the debtor is afforded more options in a Chapter 11

suggest that when we look at the applicable statute, which

What that statute says is that the court shall confirm a

Now there are, I think, 11 requirements.

9

Some

10

are relatively unimportant and some are very important.

11

The two that probably are germane to this case are

12

1129(a)(9), that says the plan shall provide for full

13

payment of priority taxes, but may do so over the course

14

of six years with interest, and the Section, I think,

1129(a)(11), that says the plan shall be feasible, or the

1

Could the IRS apply to the bankruptcy

QUESTION:

And so those are — that's really the

MR. MOSS:

Well, the debtor recognized, and it

is worth noting that counsel for the debtor, by the way,

MR. MOSS:

Chapter 11 is an endless process of

negotiation, and there are reasons, as Justice O'Connor

19

pointed out, one, why these tradeoffs are requested.

which she noted was that you need an inducement, and it

No, it's — the government took the

question, which I would like to answer with that

observation, says is it immaterial to the debtor.
You have an almost endless variety of things

that can occur in a Chapter 11.

It doesn't follow.

For

10

example, the responsible officers quite often will own the

MR. MOSS:

12

Well, it's — I'm sorry, it's a

question of my being careful how I interpret your

question.

15

At any given moment, to the extent the trust

fund taxes are due, they are not taken off the hook.

17

what is at issue in this case is whether they benefit from

18

a payment that is allocated to the trust fund portion.

19

So, in my hypothetical, if the $60,000 of trust fund taxes

20

out of $100,000 were to be paid over five years, say, then

21

they would benefit as those payments ensue.

22

would also be subject to IRS attack also as those payments

ensue, because it would probably take two to three years

for those trust fund taxes to be paid in full.

The

10

government should receive those tax payments, which then

11

gives them in effect a double payment.

12

looking for a double payment, but that is the result.

13

They are not

And then, upon the existence of a double

14

payment, the responsible officer can sue for a refund,

15

thereby keeping the government paid in full and ultimately

16

leaving the responsible officer in the position of a kind

17

of surety, with the debtor primarily paying and the

18

responsible officer secondarily liable.

19

QUESTION:

That gets it out of the officers, and

20

I would think the other creditors would want to have the

21

plan revised, because it would enhance their ability to be

22

paid in full if the government gets their taxes, their

23

trust fund taxes out of the officers.

MR. MOSS:

The creditors might want that, but it

doesn't mean that they — that they can have it.

Interesting enough, those same creditors are often the

ones who benefit by what the corporation did with the

money —
QUESTION:

4

Well can't the creditors usually

5

profit from the fact that a debtor has a surety, has a

6

guarantor?

7

MR. MOSS:

No, not usually.

The guarantor is

8

secondarily liable, and the debtor is forced to meet its

9

primary responsibility.

In fact, while it is not the case

10

here, for reasons that are set forth in the Code, in an

11

unsecured, nontax situation, the guarantor, if he paid,

12

would be subrogated to the position of the creditor, and

13

the indebtedness would not go away.

Thank you, Mr. Moss.

Thank you.

Mr. Horowitz, you have two minutes

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN I. HOROWITZ

19

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

20

MR. HOROWITZ:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

21

I would like to make a couple points.

First of

22

all, we completely disagree with the notion that the

23

debtor is not under a court order to make these payments

24

under the plan.

25

can move to dismiss the plan for not — the Chapter 11

If he doesn't pay, then the government

4

case can be reopened in the event of noncompliance under

5

Section 350 of the Code.

6

QUESTION:

That is under Section

And if for some reason the court

Well, excuse me, if you move to

7

dismiss it for noncompliance, then you are back in the

8

situation you were in pre-plan, I assume, right?

MR. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION:

That is right.

You have the same legal remedies

under the statute that you had.
MR..HOROWITZ:

Well, we would levy on them, and

13

it would be an involuntary payment and we would apply it

14

where we wanted.

15

QUESTION:

It's not a very useful court order.

16

You're saying the penalty for not obeying the court order

17

is the court order is eliminated.

18

MR. HOROWITZ:

And the protections against

19

creditors are eliminated, which is the reason why the --

20

don't forget Chapter 11 is a proceeding that is invoked by

21

the debtor to protect themselves against creditors, not

22

one that the IRS commences in order to collect.

23

Second, as far as the question of whether this

24

kind of order is appropriate, I would also like to point

25

to Section 523 of the Code, which specifically does not

MR. HOROWITZ:

Voluntary or involuntary?

Well, if you're talking about the

IRS' policy, we would not permit that designation.

would view that as under the involuntary.

Horowitz.
