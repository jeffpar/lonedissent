CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument next

Nancy J. Schwalb, and No. 88-127, Norfolk & Western Railroad

ORAL ARGUMENTS OF WILLIAM T. PRINCE

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PRINCE:

10
11

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

12

The issue in this case is whether the workers who

13

maintain and repair ship-loading equipment at a waterfront

14

situs are engaged in longshoring operations and therefore are

15

covered by the Longshore and Harborworkers' Compensation Act.

16

The Supreme Court of Virginia says they're not.

The

17

— when the Supreme Court of Virginia was first faced with the

18

identical issue, there were very few federal reported cases

19

that gave any guidance at all, and that was in 1977 and the

20

case was Ralph White against the Norfolk & Western Railway

21

Company.

22

In this case, the three cases that are now before

23

the Court, the three employees, like Ralph White, were engaged

24

in the maintenance and repair of longshore equipment.

25

brought a — a claim against th.e railway company under the

Each

1

Federal Employers Liability Act claiming damages caused by

2

employer negligence.

3

In each of the cases, the railway company gained

4

dismissal on the ground that the employees were engaged in

5

longshoring operations and that their exclusive remedy was

6

under the Longshore Act.

7

That was the exact situation that prevailed in 1977

8

in the Ralph White case, and if I may, the Ralph White case is

9

important in this context.

10

Ralph White was an electrician who worked on the

11

piers in Norfolk at Lambert's Point.

12

and the maintenance of -- of the apparatus -- excuse me, the

13

electrical apparatus — that was used to run to coal loading

14

machinery at Lambert's Point.

15

His work was the repair

Not only did Ralph White repair the machinery that

16

kept the operation going, but he actually went on board ships

17

and, on some occasions, he actually worked on scaffolding

18

attached to the piers oh — over the navigable waters.

19

The Supreme Court of Virginia held in 1977 that

20

Ralph White was not engaged in longshoring operations because

21

he did not manually handle cargo, or he did not actually

22

operate the machinery that kept the -- the operation going.

23

Now, that was in 1977.

By mid-1980, nearly all of

24

the circuit court judges in Virginia who had the same, or

25

nearly the same issue come before them, had stopped following

1

the Supreme Court of Virginia in its Ralph White case and had

2

started following the decisions of this Court in Northeast

3

Terminal v. Caputo and Pfeiffer v. Ford, and especially the

4

opinions of the federal circuit courts of appeal, especially

5

the 4th Circuit, and the Benefits Review Board opinions which

6

were interpreting this Court's opinions in Caputo and

7

Pfeiffer.

8

The Court in Caputo said that Congress intended

9

expanded coverage, and in Pfeiffer you said that Congress

10

intended a simple, uniform standard of coverage.

11

By mid-1980, the federal circuits and the Benefits

12

Review Board had worked out, following Caputo and Ford, a —

13

essentially consistent interpretation that was uniform and

14

simple in factual situations like this.

15

But in 1988, when these three cases reached the

16

Supreme Court of Virginia, the court — the Virginia court —

17

rejected the reasoning of the federal courts and rejected the

18

reasoning of the many decisions of the Benefits Review Board

19

and specifically reapplied its reasoning in the Ralph White

20

case, holding that these three employees were, in effect,

21

janitors and were not involved in longshoring operations.

22

Let me tell you for a few minutes about what these

23

three employees did.

24

C&O Railway, which is now CSX Transportation, and one was

25

employed by Norfolk & Western.

They were -- two were employed by the

Nancy Schwalb and William

1

McGlone worked for the coal loading facility at C&O at Newport

2

News, and they were engaged in cleaning the equipment that was

3

used in the coal loading operation.

4

The operation at both facilities is the picking up

5

of these coal cars, turning them upside down, dumping the coal

6

into the hoppers, from which they get onto belts and go onto

7

the ship loaders.
Now, the two employees working in Newport News had

8

9

the job of cleaning the — what — what are known as the

10

trunnion rollers.

11

dumpers move, and in the dumping operation coal unavoidably

12

falls and collects around those trunnion rollers and if that

13

coal is not cleaned away, then the operation will — will come

14

to a stop.

15

come off the belts and were — was accumulating under the

16

belts.

17

These — these are rollers upon which these

They also were involved in cleaning coal that had

Now the two circuit court Judges -- the two Virginia

18

circuit court judges — who heard the jurisdictional evidence

19

both found that the work that Nancy Schwalb and William

20

McGlone were doing was essential to the coal loading

21

operation, and that if it was not done, that operation would

22

come to a halt.

23

Now, the Supreme Court of Virginia in its decision

24

in this case actually accepts that finding and stated in its

25

opinion that, if the work was not done, the dumpers would

1

malfunction and the conveyer belts would become damaged and

2

the work would be interfered with.

3

Nevertheless, the Supreme Court, accepting the fact

4

that this work was essential and would cause the -- the coal

5

loading to stop if it were not done, said that it was

6

construing this Court's opinion in the Caputo case and that

7

this Court in the Caputo case was saying that if an employee

8

did not actually handle cargo, then he was not engaged in

9

maritime employment or longshoring operations.

(12:59 p.m.)

QUESTION:

3
4

Mr. Prince, you may continue your

argument.

5

MR. PRINCE:

Thank you.

6

Your Honors, I was saying just before the luncheon

7

recess that the Supreme Court of Virginia had acknowledged in

8

its opinion that the coal loading process would come to a stop

9

if the work was not done that Schwalb and McGlone were doing.

10

And then the Supreme Court of Virginia said that it was

11

construing your opinion in Caputo and said that that opinion

12

held that employees who were not actually handling cargo were

13

not involved in the essential elements of longshoring

14

operations and, therefore, these employers were not covered by

15

the Act.

16

It is also noteworthy that in the Caputo case, you

17

said that an employee who was not involved in the ongoing

18

process of loading was not covered.

19

Court specifically stated that it would not adopt an ongoing

20

process test.

The third employee, the one whose case —

This is not the test that you are

presenting?
MR. PRINCE:

No, Your Honor.

Actually, I think the

1

employee who is involved in an integral part of the loading

2

process is covered, also, the term has been used, "essential

3

elements."

4

integral part is covered, and these employees are all engaged

5

in the repair and maintenance of equipment which would come to

6

a halt if not done.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. PRINCE:

9

So any employee who plays even a small part of an

An integral part of the loading

operation — of the longshoring.

What we are looking at is

longshoring operations.

11

or the movement of cargo from land transportation to ship.

The loading of coal in this instance,

This would be so even though, parttime,

MR. PRINCE:

Even if, parttime, they swept out the

office.

employee is covered for some part of his work, or her work,

17

then that employee is covered for all of their work.

fallen coal, because it was a — it was —

1

factual finding that, if that coal was not cleaned out from

2

under the conveyer belts, the conveyer belts would be damaged

3

and would interfere with the loading so it was essential to

4

get that coal cleaned, and therefore, those employees are

5

involved in the longshoring operations.

6

QUESTION: And this was all they did?

7

MR. PRINCE:

8
9
10

No, that was not all they did, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

What else did they do?

MR. PRINCE:

One of the other employees — well,

11

they — one of the employees at the time of injury -- and of

12

course the time of injury is not the test, but one of the

13

employees, Mrs. Schwalb, at the time of injury, was cleaning

14

out coal from the trunnion rollers, which was necessary to

15

allow the dumpers to operate.

16

QUESTION:

Sure.

Sure.

But did they have any other

17

duties, other than -- other than this integral part of the

18

loading process?

MR. PRINCE:

bathrooms and of offices.
QUESTION:

But the injury was — all of them were in

the process of performing their loading duties?

23

MR. PRINCE:

QUESTION:

25

They did some amount of cleaning of

That — that is correct, Your Honor.
Did they do any repair work on damaged

equipment or anything?

MR. PRINCE:

1

Not Schwalb and McGlone, but the third

2

employee, Robert Goode, actually worked up on the dumper. And

3

at the time of his injury —

4

In fact, the circuit judge who heard the

5

jurisdictional evidence in that case found that the

6

overwhelming amount of his time was -- was done in the

7

maintenance of ship-loading equipment.

8

machinist.

9

He was a pier

Now, at the time of his injury, he was repairing a

10

retarder, which is a piece of equipment up on the dumper that

11

is used to bring the cars to a stop when they get to the

12

position where they are to be dumped, and the repairs that he

13

did in fact brought a stop to the operation.

14
15
16
17
18

Repairs had to be done — the repairs could not be
done while the coal was being loaded and the work stopped.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, did any of the three

employees bring a — a Federal Employer Liability Act suit?
MR. PRINCE:

Your Honor, they all brought one.

That

19

is how this came on.

20

Employer Liability Act claims, and the railway company in each

21

case moved to dismiss on the ground that the Court did not

22

have jurisdiction because the exclusive remedy was under the

23

Longshore Act.

24
25

QUESTION:

Each one of them brought Federal

MR. PRINCE:

2

They would most likely be greater.

3

-- it's the difference between a negligence action and a

4

compensation remedy.

5

QUESTION:

It

Mr. Prince, the limits of this so-called

6

functional relationship test that you propose aren't entirely

7

clear.

8

9

In a sense, all employees at the maritime situs
might be said to contribute to the loading process.

10

MR. PRINCE:

11

QUESTION:

That is true, Your Honor.
It has — the test you propose has the

12

disadvantage of forcing the courts, in a case-by-case basis,

13

to determine how essential and how integral the work is to the

14

loading process.

15

MR. PRINCE:

Your Honor, I don't — I don't think

16

it's going to be a test of how essential.

17

determination is, is it essential, or is it an integral part

18

of the loading?

19

I think the factual

There comes a point where land transportation ends

20

and everything thereafter is the movement of the cargo toward

21

the ship and onto the ship.

22

movement of the coal once land transportation ends — is an

23

integral part.

24
25

All of that effort — the

As — as this Court said in the Ford case, anyone
who is involved in a portion of the work is involved in an

integral part of it, and in — and in fact, there would be

2

probably no worker who would be involved in all of it, not in

involved only in a part of it.

Mr. Prince, what about a machinist who —

who works for the railroad only in downtown Norfolk who —
who repairs, among other things, one of these trunnions that's
essential for the movement of coal?
QUESTION:

Under the rulings of the Pfeiffer and

12

Caputo, if he spends part of his time in repairing ship­

13

loading equipment, he would be covered all the time.

14
15

QUESTION:

Yes, but this is — it would not satisfy

the situs requirement.

16

MR. PRINCE:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. PRINCE:

He wouldn't — oh, I beg your pardon.
I said in downtown.
He would not be on the situs.

he would not be on the situs.

QUESTION:

Right,

He would not meet the situs —

So, you add to your test not just that it

21

be essential, or an integral part of the loading process, but

22

that it be done on the site?

23

MR. PRINCE:

On the situs, and there was no question

24

in this case that all three employees were on -- on a

25

statutory situs at the time.

So, yes, they have got to be on

At the time of the injury.
So, this man that Justice Scalia talks

about worked downtown 364 days out of the year but came down

on November 1st and had an accident, he'd be covered?

QUESTION:

10

MR. PRINCE:

That's a hard question.
That's your position though, is it not?
I think there could be, as the — I

11

think it's the 9th Circuit, in one case referred to an

12

employee's presence on the waterfront, or on the situs, as

13

episodic, and I guess there could be an episodic presence in

14

the situs that would exclude that particular worker.

What about a timekeeper working on the

situs?
MR. PRINCE:

3

If a timekeeper were merely an office

4

worker he would be excluded by statute, but if he were out in

5

the area where the work was being done, if he was involved in

6

— in getting the cargo moved, he would be covered.

7

The 1984 amendment specifically excluded office

8

workers.

9

in 1981 that would exclude workers who were engaged in

And I might say that there was an amendment offered

10

repairing and maintaining ship-loading equipment and that

amendment was dropped before the 1984 amendments were enacted.

2

by the act.
As Justice Scalia pointed out though, the -- the

3
4

function of the status provision is to select for a type of

5

work, and some types of work — the logic of the status

6

provision includes workers who are outside' the geographical

7

location of the situs test.
So that someone who is mining steel, or mining metal

8

9

that will be used in the ship-loading equipment, would be

10

covered by the logic of the test, but the fact is that that

11

person is never going to be on the situs.

12

That is, the situs and the status test work in

13

tandem to select sort of the intersection of two groups of

14

workers who are covered by the act.
And — finally, I would — I would say that the

15
16

status provision does select most workers on the waterfront,

17

and that is the point of the Longshore Act, is to cover those

18

workers.

What about the problem of the occasional

visit to the situs and the injury occurring there?
MS. DESAN-HUSSON:

It would depend on how often the

23

once a week or once a month, that worker would be covered by

pressing that argument?

I'm sorry, which?

In light of the fact that all the situs

it's.nice of you to say well, we wouldn't press it if he's

That is, it used a term which, as the Court made

1

clear in Perini, had been given a broad meaning before 1972.

3

Then, making explicit that the list was not exhaustive, it

specified the named categories of workers who were engaged in

maritime employment — that is, longshorers, et cetera.

then repeated the functions of those workers in the situs

provision.

It

Attention to the objectives of the statute makes it

8
9

even clearer that Congress wrote broadly and functionally when

10

it wrote the status provision.
It wrote functionally because it was responding --

11
12

it was reforming a system in which injury had depended only on

13

the location — in which recovery had depended only on the

14

location of an injury.

It wrote broadly because it did not want the new

line to become as arbitrary as the old line.

In this case, the loading operation is almost wholly

line that would — would cover longshorers would have to cover

that would cover all who were on the waterfront.

It therefore

2

declined to import distinctions like the point of rest that

3

the Court rejected in Pfeiffer and in Northeast Marine

A rational coverage of all those engaged in

1908 to benefit railroad workers, or by the Longshore and

1

than the one adopted by the Supreme Court of Virginia?
MR. WILCOX:

2

That's true to some extent, but I

3

believe that if the Court reviews the cases — for example, in

4

the Dravo case, which is a 3rd Circuit case, it's very similar

5

to the situation for McGlone and Schwalb.
That involved a — a laborer, a person who was

6
7

involved in clean-up activities similar to what Schwalb and

8

McGlone were doing, and in that case, 3rd Circuit, they have -

9

- they have indicated that the Longshore Harborworkers

10

Compensation Act does not apply.

11

It's not uniform as to where all the circuits stand on this

12

case.

13

They haven't extended it.

The Virginia Supreme Court in the White decision

14

relied on the Weyerhauser case, which was a 9th Circuit case,

15

which has not been overruled, and that, again, limits the

16

expansion of the longshore coverage.

17

If we have to examine the legislative intent of the

18

Congress when the act was amended in 1972.

reviewed that intent, both in the Caputo decision and later in

20

the Perini decision, which was Director v. -- Office of

21

Workers Compensation v. Perini.

well recalls, having written the opinion, the purposes were to

2

expand coverage, to extend it to longshoring workers and it

3

recognized the changing nature of the industry.

4

Because of containerization a lot of the work had

5

moved from the ship and onto the land, and there —but there

6

were three main groups that were interested in amending that

7

Longshore Act, and this was indicated first in the Caputo

8

decision and then later reexamined in the Perini case.
They involved three groups.

9

The first of the groups

10

were the ship owners, who did not want to be sued on a

11

seaworthiness doctrine by the longshore workers.

12

were the employers of the longshore workers, who had — under

13

a judicially created doctrine had to indemnify the ship

14

owners, and the third group were the workers themselves, who

15

wanted to have an improvement in their benefits.

16

The second

And the problem here was the benefits under the

17

federal statute were ordinarily superior to the benefits under

18

the state workers' compensation statutes, and one of the

19

purposes for amending the act and expanding the coverage was

20

to permit these longshore and harborworkers to enjoy improved

21

benefits under the federal statute.

22

Now, in the case we have here, we think it's

23

important to note that all three of these workers are railroad

24

workers.

No, I'm not suggesting that it's

QUESTION:

Well, why is that relevant, that none of

them filed claims?
MR. WILCOX:

Well, because if the purpose for

10

amending the act was to improve their benefits, these workers

11

here, these railroad workers, all — already have a perfectly

12

suitable source of compensation through the Federal Employers

13

Liability Act.

14

It's not optional.

I mean, they have a method.

For

15

the last 80 years, they've had a way to file for claims when

16

they're hurt on the job, and that's through the FELA.

don't suggest that it's optional, but they already have an

adequate remedy that's provided to them through the Federal

Employers Liability Act.

So, we should disregard the language of

intent of the Congress was to expand the coverage to benefit

QUESTION:

So all railroad workers aren't excluded,

even though any of them could sue under the FELA?
MR. WILCOX:

Yes sir, that's correct, and the Court

here this afternoon could make a policy decision that there's

MR. WILCOX:

(Laughter)

QUESTION:

No, I'm not.

Mr. Wilcox, we're dealing with a statute

7

that feels it necessary to specifically except from the term

"employee" under the act, individuals who are, one, employed

9

by suppliers, transporters or vendors; two, are temporarily

10

doing business; and, three, are not engaged in work normally

11

performed by employees of that employer under this chapter,

and -- and a lot of other specific exceptions, which would be

13

unnecessary if your interpretation of the act were the

interpretation that Congress accepted and intended.

15

For instance, the exception for individuals employed

In that opinion, it was noted that an earlier

We suggest that what the railroad is

The point of rest theory was based on cargo being

off-loaded from a ship.

it was no longer moving on the shore, and that was where the
