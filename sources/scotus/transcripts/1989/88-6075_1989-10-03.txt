ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARTIN S. CARLSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

Very well,

MR. CARLSON:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This case presents the question of whether

12

statements obtained from a Defendant as a result of an arrest

13

made without probable cause may be used substantively as an

14

admission to rebut the testimony of a defense witness.

15

Mr. James, the Petitioner, was found guilty of

16

murder and attempted murder arising out of a shooting incident

17

in Chicago.

18

shooting, he was arrested by two police officers with --

19

without a warrant and taken to a squad car where he was

20

questioned concerning the color of his hair.

21
22

23

And the following day, the day after the

QUESTION:

He was arrested in his mother's beauty

salon while he was having his hair dyed and reshaped?
MR. CARLSON:

Well, the testimony of the police

24

officer was that he was discovered under a hair dryer.

25

statement to the police, which the trial court excluded as

His

having been the fruit of the unlawful arrest, his oral

2

statement was to the effect that he was there to get his hair

3

dyed black and curled.

4

At trial the state presented five members of the

5

group who were with the deceased and the other shooting

6

victim.

7

Petitioner as having been the — the third man in the other

8

group and the one who was the shooter.

testified that at the time of the shooting --

They also all

Mr. Carlson, could you slow down a little

I think some of us are having a little trouble

MR. CARLSON:

Yes, sir.

They also testified that at

14

the time of the shooting Petitioner was wearing what they

15

called a butter-style hair — hair which is a slicked back

16

hair, reddish-brown in color.

17

state's case, was the eyewitness testimony.

That was the substance of the

18

For the defense, in addition to presenting a police

19

officer who had interviewed some of the eye witnesses and who

20

related certain prior inconsistent statements, Petitioner

21

called a friend of the family named Jewel Henderson, who

22

testified that on the day of the -- shooting she had taken

23

Petitioner to a high school to transfer, to pick up his

24

transcripts and to register at another high school and on that

25

day his hair was, in fact, black and among other things he was

not wearing an earring, also.

2

the state's other eyewitnesses.

3

That was also testified to by

At this point, the prosecution asked the Court, or

4

announced to the Court that it wished to use Petitioner's

5

suppressed statements for the purpose of, as it was

6

erroneously called, impeaching or rebutting Miss Henderson's

7

testimony.

8

9

Defense counsel objected on Fourth Amendment
grounds, calling, of course, attention to the fact that this

10

Court's decisions had only allowed the use of tainted evidence

11

to impeach the testimony of the Defendant himself.

12

The trial court rejected that argument but did hold

13

a voluntariness hearing at which the two arresting officers

14

testified, and having found the statements to have been

15

voluntary, the court ruled that they could be used, as he put

16

it, to impeach and rebut Miss Henderson's testimony.

17

Thereafter, Officer — Officer Glynn, one of the

18

arresting officers testified and related, in essence that in

19

the squad car he asked the Defendant what his hair color was

20

the day before and Mr. James responded that it was reddish-

21

brown and combed straight back.

22

Later, approximately two hours, I believe, at the

23

police station, he was interrogated again and at that point,

24

he reiterated that the color was brown and he also was asked

25

what — what he was doing at the beauty parlor, and according

to the detective Respondent — or Petitioner stated he was

2

there to get his hair dyed black and curled to change his

3

appearance, and all of those statements were -- were used —

4

were presented to the jury in rebuttal.

5

Counsel for Petitioner requested a limiting

6

instruction to the effect that these statements could not be

7

used as evidence of guilt, but only as bearing on the

8

credibility of Miss Henderson.

9

The trial court refused the written instruction

10

tendered by the defense but did give an oral instruction which

11

in effect said that this testimony was offered to prove that

12

his hair was black -- I'm sorry, was red.

On appeal the Illinois Appellate Court reversed

QUESTION:

Do you think -- Mr. Carlson, do you think

16

the trial court's oral instruction was or was not the

17

equivalent of an instruction to use it only for determining

18

credibility?

19

MR. CARLSON:

20

QUESTION:

It definitely was not limiting.

So, it was — the — the trial court

21

allowed it, in its instruction, to be used for, in effect,

22

rebuttal, to be considered substantively?

23

MR. CARLSON:

Definitely.

mention the word "impeaching," but the instruction read, it's

So, there isn't any instruction that you

can think of that would have cured this?

MR. CARLSON:

That -- that would not -- that would

have solved the problem of it being used for its assertive

value.

different question here, if that instruction had been than, in

22

your view, you have now?

still been here, because I think the -- the instruction

of the statement, and when the court repeatedly overruled that

3

objection, which was made several times during lengthy

4

hearings, he said well then, at least you've got to give me a

limiting instruction.

His objection was to the admission

But I don't believe that, given the -- the logical

basis of this kind of impeachment, of -- of contradiction,

that you can tell a jury that a witness will be discredited

unless you also tell them that they've to believe the truth of

10

the matter asserted in the impeaching or rebutting evidence.

11

So, our — our position is that you can no way you

12

can logically, or — or — or give an instruction to the jury

13

that would make any sense as a matter of logic, that they

14

could follow and that that could be effective in preventing --

QUESTION:

You say that an instruction saying that

17

the Defendant's statements were introduced only to impeach the

18

defense witness' testimony would -- would have, what, made no

sense?

MR. CARLSON:

3

is true, if they believe it for its substantive value.

4

say that they can consider it only for a purpose that is

5

nonsubstantive, but when it's — when it's obvious that

6

purpose requires substantive use, like I say, is logically --

7

it just doesn't make any sense.

Well the problem with that is that it will bear on

So, to

As the -- the dissenting opinions in the Illinois
Supreme Court — I think the problem in the Illinois Supreme

10

Court, was their failure to recognize the majority opinion,

11

that what we're talking about here is

12

self-contradiction.

13

QUESTION:

contradiction, not

But of course, those aren't

14

constitutional principles themselves, you know, the law of

15

evidence and the circumstances under which you can impeach a

16

witness and what — what they generally don't have any

17

constitutional basis.

18

MR. CARLSON:

Certainly, but the problem is, what

19

does have constitutional magnitude is whether unlawfully

20

seized evidence is being used to prove a Defendant's guilt —

21

as substantive evidence of guilt.

outside of the good-faith cases, has never allowed at trial

23

evidence obtained unlawfully from — from a defendant to be

24

used to prove his guilt.

did conclude that that was error.

MR. CARLSON:

No, they did -- did not, Justice

0'Connor.

QUESTION:

MR. CARLSON:

And thought it was harmless?
No, but that was the alternative

6

argument that we had made.

7

error in admitting the statements and that any error in the

8

limiting instructions or in the closing argument was harmless.

9

But their -- their — their basic holding was that there was

10

What they held was, there is no

no error in admitting the statements in the first instance.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. CARLSON:

But if it was error, it was harmless?
No.

No, again, they did not reach the

13

question of whether the admission of the statements was

14

harmless.

15

error in limiting instructions or closing argument was

16

harmless.

They only said that, assuming that was proper, any

question.

there in their opinion, but the Illinois Supreme Court did not

20

address that question.

21

They held that it was — I'll say not harmless

QUESTION:

Well, but the Illinois Supreme Court

22

apparently thought that there would have been error, and real

23

error, if — unless there was an instruction that the evidence

24

could be used only for impeachment purposes.

MR. CARLSON:

Yes, but I think that's, again, it's

1

our position and I think the position of the dissenting

2

position in the Illinois Supreme Court was that the majority

3

overlooked the fact that there — this is not like the case

4

you had in Havens or Walder or Harris -- or Harris.

5

could not use -- you could not impeach by contradiction and

6

not use it for its assertive value.

QUESTION:
Havens?

Well, why is it any different than

Havens was the T-shirt case.
MR. CARLSON:

Where the Defendant has assisted his

11

accomplice by cutting up his T-shirt to make an extra pocket

12

in the — in the drug courier and then he puts the torn-up T-

13

shirt in his own luggage.

How can you possibly say that in --

14

in that case, it was used only for impeachment, and that in

15

this case, it cannot — the statement cannot be used only for

16

impeachment?

17

the case.

I don't understand the difference in the -- in

MR. CARLSON:

It isn't as clear cut in the case of

No, but it's accompanied — it's

accompanied by an assertion of the police officer that the T-

MR. CARLSON:

Well, this Court did, but I -- I

think —

QUESTION:

15

MR. CARLSON:

So, you're saying Havens is wrong?
No, I'm saying that Havens was

16

predicated on the assumption that the instruction in that case

17

could effectively tell the jury not to use it as evidence of

guilt.

19

admissible as substantive evidence of guilt.

20

I mean, the Court held that the evidence was not

QUESTION:

Well, none of our cases, though, have

21

ever said that there has to be an element of self-

22

contradiction in order to have evidence that undermines

23

credibility of a witness.

and while we've had cases that have involved self-

25

contradiction, I don't think you can find in them any

2

witness can be undermined, can you?
MR. CARLSON:

3
4

No, that's true, there — there have

been -QUESTION:

5

So let's suppose that that's a perfectly

6

legitimate way of undermining the credibility of a witness, to

7

introduce rebuttal evidence of this kind.

8

MR. CARLSON:

9

QUESTION:

Well, I think —

Then the question becomes whether it must

10

be accompanied by an instruction so that it's — it's limited

11

in its use to that purpose.

12

Illinois court, as I understood it, thought it would be

13

harmless.

14

MR. CARLSON:

As to that question, I guess the

Well, the court

in this case thought

15

that

the instruction given by the trial court — the oral

16

instruction, in conjunction, if -- and they didn't even

17

acknowledge that it may have been erroneous — in conjunction

18

with the standard Illinois instruction on impeachment by self-

19

contradiction was adequate, and that — if — if — they said

20

if it wasn't, it was harmless.

21

But getting back to the issue

of physical evidence,

I think,

I can't deny that.

case, I think, indeed, when you — when you would be able to

impeach a defense witness with physical evidence.

It's hard to conceive in the abstract of a case

1
2

where physical evidence could somehow be inconsistent with

3

something that a defense witness said as opposed to what a

4

defendant might have said, because generally it is seized from

QUESTION:

It just won't be relevant to their

Mr. Carlson, I suppose it's evident to

you that beginning with the Walder case in 1947, the Harris

10

case in 1971, the Havens case sometime in early '80s, the

11

Court has gradually expanded the use that has been permitted

12

of this sort of statement.

13

make, other than another step of expansion, if we were to say

14

here that so long as the government doesn't use it in its case

15

in chief, it's perfectly permissible to use it substantively?

16

MR. CARLSON:

And what great difference does it

Well, our position is that the danger,

17

or what's wrong with that is the -- is the deterrent function

18

of the exclusionary rule, that it would add significant

19

incentive to the police to make a lot more arrests.

20

QUESTION:

Do — do — do — do you think fewer

21

Miranda warnings would be given if — if — if that rule came

from this Court?

MR. CARLSON:

Well, this was a Fourth Amendment

case.

Well, few — fewer — fewer — less

1

attention — less attention paid to the law regarding searches

2

and seizures?

3

MR. CARLSON:

Well, I — I — I think that based on

4

— as this Court always has, it's based its — its

5

determinations on applying the exclusionary rule and its

6

assumptions on police conduct, and here we're dealing with the

7

core -- the center of the officer's attention is, his zone of

8

primary interest, the criminal trial.

9

It seems to me that, as this Court held in Brown and

10

Dunaway in the unlawful arrest statement cases, that there is

11

indeed a need to deter seizures for investigation, seizures on

12

bare suspicion, which I think is what we had here.

13

QUESTION:

But why — why would it be inadequate

14

deterrence to say that it extends only to the government's

15

case in chief?

16

MR. CARLSON:

Well, our -- our position is, that --

17

that's what we -- that as the law now stands, the vast

18

majority of authority is that you can only use tainted

19

statements to impeach the Defendant's own testimony.

20

granted — granted that there will always be the deterrent of

21

the bar in chief, but if — if the state — if the officers

22

feel that — that they would be able to have independent

23

evidence to get past the restricted finding, I think the value

24

to them of -- of, under this new rule of the Illinois Supreme

25

Court would be

Now,

1

QUESTION:

Yes, but they can't — they can't

2

anticipate that they would — they can't manufacture the

3

opportunity to use it.

4

— the evidence you want to contradict would have to be

5

brought out on direct examination of the defense witness.

6

8

MR. CARLSON:

The way the Illinois court put it, the

That — that's correct, the Illinois

Supreme Court —
QUESTION:

So, that the officer -- the prosecution

9

isn't permitted to — to bring this statement out that would

10

justify introducing this illegally seized evidence on cross-

11

examination .

12

MR. CARLSON:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

That's true, but --

It's the defense that is offering this

statement that is contradicted by illegally seized evidence.
MR. CARLSON:

I think, again, if the police are

16

seeking an admission and they've got a broad admission, it

17

would be virtually impossible for the Defendant to put on any

18

kind of a defense without being inconsistent.

19

I mean, that — that's -- that's the incentive, and

20

— and in addition, as we point out in our reply brief, it's

21

not only the use of the evidence that would be of value, it's

22

-- the actual use — it's the fact that the police would see

23

it as a means of -- of tying the defendant's hands and

24

enhancing the chances of convictions by deterring the defense

25

from putting any — any evidence on at all, and —

QUESTION:

1

But if -- if the goal of a criminal trial

2

is to try to find the truth, certainly this would enhance that

3

goal.

MR. CARLSON:

There's no question about it that any

5

time you apply the exclusionary rule you are not furthering

6

the goal of truth.

7

the goal of —

The question always is, are you furthering

MR. CARLSON:

10

Some other value.
Well, the Fourth Amendment interests

here.
QUESTION:

11

Well, usually, I wouldn't — I wouldn't

12

suppose the officers really know when they see something like

13

— like this that it's -- they don't know how critical it

14

might be to their case.

15

times, if — if evidence they seize is excluded they haven't

16

got any case left.

MR. CARLSON:

So they're taking a terrific risk.
Well, not in the case of statements.

I think, generally speaking, a Defendant's statements are not

22

generally essential to the state's case in chief, certainly.

obtained statements.

It would also apply to physical

2

evidence, but again, I think that would be a much more unusual

3

situation where that would ever come about.

4

But in — in this very case, the police officers

5

knew when they took Mr. James into custody that there were

6

several eye witnesses to the offense and that if they ever —

7

if they ever found the right person they would probably get

8

identifications and they wouldn't need the statement.

9

And the first — the first question they asked him,

10

as a matter of fact, was what was the color of his hair, and I

11

think that was clearly -- they -- they were trying to get

12

statements that would conform to what they knew of the offense

13

already.

14

The danger is that — we don't maintain that the

15

police would have to think specifically about what possible

16

specific testimony might be given that it might be useful for.

17

It's just the overall message that if -- if you adopt this

18

rule, that now we can use unlawfully obtained statement or

19

physical evidence, I — I suppose would apply to Miranda

20

violations as well, whenever the Defendant puts on any kind of

21

inconsistent evidence in his defense.

22

And again, it's not based on a right to do so, but

23

if the police perceive a value to it I think that's, as this

24

Court has held, you look at the common sense assumptions on

25

their behavior.

Furthermore, I — I think one further ramification

1
2

of this rule is if the Court does approve the — use -- the

3

substantive use in rebuttal I don't see how that could not

4

apply to the Defendant's own testimony and therefore that

5

under the -- the requirement of Harris and Havens that there

6

be written instructions, I don't think it would any longer

7

really apply.
QUESTION:

8

9

No, it wouldn't, because you're not using

it just for impeachment any longer.
MR. CARLSON:

10

That's right, you're using it for

11

rebuttal for proof of -- of facts in the case.

12

expansion of the use of unlawfully obtained evidence, both in

13

terms of who it will apply to and also its use, I think is not

14

a small step here, it's a major step and I think is — is —

15

is one this Court should -- should not sanction.

I'd like to reserve the rest of my time, unless
there are any further questions.

deterrence flows when the evidence becomes unavailable for the

state's case in chief.

4

The Solicitor General, writing as amicus for the

5

state in this case, has suggested that this case is an

6

appropriate vehicle for this Court to draw that as the bright

7

line, and Your Honors, the people of Illinois agree with that

position.
Your Honors, there are two steps to draw that line

that must be taken.

12

witness and then to cross-examination of a witness, and then

13

there's also the related step of — the step of impeachment to

steps.

would make a big difference, of course, if the Defendant

3

doesn't put on any defense, but if you have any substantive

evidence that tends to prove guilt, would it not always be

I think not, Your Honor, because at the

QUESTION:

MR. MADSEN:

I see.
Your Honors, for — a police officer

will take — will get eventually to take the stand, if a

defendant now presents conflicting evidence in his case in

The police officer will get to take the stand and if

12

— if we extend here to direct -- and I think certainly, Your

13

Honors, what -- what a defense witness -- or, what a defendant

14

does through a witness is clearly attributable to him.

15

The court cannot allow a defendant to use a witness

And what the police officer knows now is he -- he'll

you — you would not allow — you — you can't impeach a

witness on a collateral matter, they say, so that the

testimony of the second witness has to be material to the —

to the issues being considered by the jury, which this would

qualify as.

was impeachment.

9

But I think very few jurisdictions would say that

MR. MADSEN:

Your Honor, I — I agree.

I'm not sure

there are many jurisdictions — I'm not sure there's another

10

jurisdiction that would say this is impeachment in this

11

particular — in this particular instance, but my Court has

12

told me it's impeachment and I suppose that if you say well,

13

to the extent that he said it, it may tend to discredit her,

14

just that he at some earlier point said it.

15

You wouldn't necessarily have to believe him.

16

if -- if you didn't believe him, impeachment would fail.

17

you wouldn't necessarily have to believe him to call into

18

question her credibility.

19

Now,
But

But that's — that's the only approach we've been

20

able to see to even begin to support this as impeachment, but

21

I don't see how this Court can interfere with what the — the

22

State of Illinois has -- has called -- but the label makes no

difference.

Have you found any other case in any

QUESTION:

MR. MADSEN:

We've not.
This is all by itself?
It is.

To my knowledge -- to my

recollection, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

5

Isn't the question whether it's

6

impeachment within the meaning of the exception or the

7

exclusionary rule really a federal question rather than --MR.

MADSEN:

9

Illinois Supreme Court has labeled this for purposes of

I think, Your Honor, that's the point.

What the

10

Illinois evidentiary law is a different question from what --

11

what you need to face, and I think that's an easy way to

12

address that question, and I think, Your Honors, that if you

13

take that approach to this question, then that will give you

14

the solution and avoid the business of, there's

15

look at this as impeachment and try and address it from that,

16

there's a waiver of the first instruction, there's two

17

harmless error analyses in this opinion, and the much easier

18

course to take would be that course.

You can put in

anything on rebuttal.

2

MR. MADSEN:

3

Is that statement just as damaging —
To the extent that it's proper for

rebuttal.

4

QUESTION:

Is that statement just as damaging to the

5

defendant whether it's on direct testimony or rebuttal

6

testimony?

7

MR. MADSEN:

It's just — it's just as damaging

8

either way, and it's just as damaging whether it comes from

9

the mouth of the defendant or from the mouth of one of his

10

witnesses, and I submit either on cross or direct, but

11

certainly on direct.

12

13

QUESTION:

So that any defendant who takes the stand

or puts on a defense loses Miranda?

14

MR. MADSEN:

Not -- he — he loses — not — Your

15

Honor — he loses it -- he does not lose it any -- you've

16

already made that determination, Your Honors, in Walder and

17

Harris.

18

determination has already been made, and in balancing the

19

exclusionary rule the -- you've already decided that the

20

deterrent ends of that aren't well met by — by allowing that

21

to happen.

I guess — I guess if we say he does, that the

QUESTION:

Doesn't rebuttal itself have some

limitations in most states?

That is, it has to be a -- a

That's true, Your Honor.

The case -- the

You can't --

But all we do is, we have

protection of this evidence and we move — all we're doing is

11

shifting — making the person whose — whose court it is in,

12

as — as we say, responsible for the use of — for how that

13

evidence comes in or not.

14

QUESTION:

But at least when you're dealing with a

15

confession, that is always going to relate to whatever the

16

defendant puts on, because whatever he puts on, it -- it will

17

go to establish the point that he did not commit the crime,

18

and if you have a confession that will always be able to come

19

in, as far as relevance is concerned, isn't that right?

20

far as being properly in response to what was in the case in

21

chief?

As

Wouldn't a confession always come in?
MR. MADSEN:

It will, but if the confession were

properly admitted -- it were legally taken, there — the

confession would be there.

Justice's question -- in Fourth Amendment violations I can

understand how very often you wouldn't be able to get

something in unless he had specifically said that the -- the

puts on any kind of a defense, you're going to be able to

Your Honor, could I ask -- if you're

talking in terms of "I did it" —

Yes.
Then that's different also from a

statement like the one in this case — I had brown hair.
QUESTION:

Okay.

You're right.

I -- I'm talking

about the "I did it" confession.
MR. MADSEN:

And that would be -- while that is the

19

one thing that would make it difficult for him to put on

20

evidence against, that also is the highest price we pay for

21

the exclusionary rule, because that's "I did it," and then

allowing the evidence to put in -- the defendant to put in

evidence that thwarts the truth-seeking process that "I did

it" and that's the highest price -- price we pay, and — and

him into the chair and started changing his hair color, right?

10

MR. MADSEN:

At least — at least that.

11

Your Honor, as far as the policeman is concerned,

12

the evidence is lost if he loses it, unless the defendant does

13

something to allow it to come back in, and a policeman is not

14

in a position to try to work out the legalities that the seven

15

judges below, or the seven -- ten judges below, and you, and

16

Judge Pincham in the trial court, are trying to make when

17

they're trying to decide whether to cross the threshold or

18

whether to ask the question, and Your Honors, I submit that an

19

order from the chief is going to be, gather admissible

20

evidence, and that's the point that this Court should work

from.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARTIN S. CARLSON

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

MR. CARLSON:

I don't know if I misunderstood

4

Justice Scalia's comments on — on -- he saw the danger more

5

in terms of Miranda than in terms of the Fourth Amendment, but

6

I want to emphasize that this is really a derivative Miranda.

7

This was an unlawful arrest for the purposes of

8

interrogation, so that it was getting him — it was — the

9

arrest was the vehicle by which the police could then obtain

10

the statement that they would lose without — without the —■

11

having done the illegality.
So, I think in the case of physical evidence perhaps

12

13

that's correct, but certainly in the case of Dunaway-type

14

violations, where it's an investigative arrest for the purpose

15

of interrogation, I think that the incentive is definitely

16

there.

17

QUESTION:

Well, of course, they could have — the

18

police I suppose could have found out what color his hair had

19

been.
MR. MADSEN:

20

Well, as a matter of fact, that may

21

have aided their probable cause argument, but that's the

22

point.

23

is not set out, but the arrest was based on — two boys on the

24

street came by and said, we heard rumors that Romeo, who the

25

police said was the Petitioner's nickname, may have done this.

They didn't do that, among other things.

The evidence

1

And based on that, they went and picked him up.

2

I think it's pretty clear, as the trial court found,

3

that there was no probable cause here and the police couldn't

4

have believed that they had probable cause.

5

think this rule would both encourage carelessness, but I think

6

it would also encourage deliberate violations of Fourth

7

Amendment rights.

8
9

So this — I

As — as far as, again, whether a police officer has
to sit down and think this through, I mean that's true.

I

10

think the message will be that the restrictions on the use of

11

this kind of evidence have been greatly relaxed.

12

it'll be valuable to us to get it, so if you can't get it

13

another way, and especially, as in this case, if the prospect

14

of having independent evidence is very high, where you know

15

you have several eyewitnesses, then I think that the -- the

16

deterrent, or the incentive, is there and I think I'll close

17

with that, unless the Court has any other questions.

18
19

QUESTION:
may.

It's —

I have two very quick questions, if I

Did you say that Judge Pincham tried this case?

20

MR. CARLSON:

21

QUESTION:

That's correct.

The other question I had is how — is

22

this a typical period of time from trial in 1983 to now, on

23

direct review?

24
25

Does it take that long in Illinois?

MR. CARLSON:

Well, I think the -- the trial itself

was not that —

1
2

You know it was pending in the court of -

- the appellate court for about three years?

3

MR. CARLSON:

It was delayed in the appellate court

4

-- it took the appellate court, I believe over a year, or a

5

year and a half, to decide the case after oral argument and

6

for them to explain it.

7

QUESTION:

Are things that — I'm just wondering if

things are that bad.
