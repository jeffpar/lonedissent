ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE L. GARRETT

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. GARRETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case involves central issues concerning the

12

adoption and the enforcement of state air control

13

regulations under the Clean Air Act.

14

presented is, in a case where a state has revised its

15

regulations, whether EPA may bring a suit to enforce the

16

original unrevised regulations and to collect penalties

17

without first complying with its statutory duty to act to

18

approve or disapprove the revision.

19

The question

We request that the decision below be reversed

20

because it allows EPA to veto state regulatory choices

21

through an enforcement mechanism without following the

22

procedures and requirements of the statute.

23

that this procedure EPA is following creates a regulatory

24

limbo which frustrates the efforts of states and companies

25

to respond to changing conditions.

We submit

1

Now, I want to clarify at the outset that our

2

point is not simply that EPA took too long in acting on

3

the revision in question here.

4

fundamental one than that.

Our point is a more

We submit that Congress established a very

5
6

careful sequence in the statute, first, for the state

7

promulgation of state implementation plans and revisions

8

to those plans, secondly, for limited and timely EPA

9

review of those plans and, only after that, for

10

enforcement.

11

the limited and timely review, EPA has put the cart before

12

the horse, if you will.

13

We submit that by skipping that second step,

Now, in this case, the Commonwealth of

14

Massachusetts gave General Motors an extension of time,

15

from 1985 to 1987, 1987 being the attainment deadline in

16

the Clean Air Act that's relevant here and, indeed, it was

17

the deadline for all of Massachusetts, as granted by EPA.
The purpose of the extension was to allow

18

%

19

General Motors to replace an older painting facility that

20

it had in Framingham, Massachusetts and instead to build a

21

new more modern facility with substantially lower

22

emissions.

23

EPA had previously approved similar extensions

24

of time through state plan revisions for other companies

25

in 1984 and 1985, and the Agency did so pursuant to a

2

policy that it had announced in 1981.
In this particular case, EPA waited while

3

General Motors built its plant.

It completed the new

4

facility at great expense in July of 1987, and then when

5

the new facility was built and the old facility was shut

6

down, EPA filed a lawsuit in August of 1987 to collect

7

penalties for the period of time during which the company

8

had operated the old paint shop.

9

any action -- any final action on a revision.

It did so without taking

10

Now, we submit that General Motors should have

11

been entitled to comply with the Commonwealth's revision

12

and should have not been penalized for doing so until EPA

13

took action on the revision.

14

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Garrett, the statute, does

15

it not, makes the terms of the original plan enforceable

16

until a revision is approved, as I understand it.

17
18

MR. GARRETT:

Are you referring to Section

110(d) of the statute, Your Honor?

19

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.

20

MR. GARRETT:

Your Honor, it seems to us that

21

the government's argument with respect to that section

22

proves a little bit too much, and it's somewhat a

23

mechanical and artificial reading of the statute.

24

reason we say that is because it does not deal with EPA's

25

corresponding duty under the statute to comply with its
5

And the

1

obligations to review a plan in a timely way.

2

We submit that the Congress —

3

QUESTION:

Well, of course, the SG takes the

4

position that there is no four-month deadline requirement

5

for action on proposed revisions.

6

be first to acknowledge that the language of the statutory

7

provisions could be interpreted as the Solicitor General

8

suggests, as not requiring revisions to be approved within

9

four months.
MR. GARRETT:

10

And I suppose you would

We disagree on that point, Your

11

Honor.

But there's a more fundamental point that I would

12

like to emphasize.

13

under the statute, because it uses the word "shall," that

14

EPA has a duty to act on the plan and plan revisions.

15

we're saying that EPA has breached that duty act.

16

it's four months or a reasonable time --

I think that there can be no doubt

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. GARRETT:

19
20

Whether

Well —
-- they should be acting before

they bring lawsuits.
QUESTION:

But the -- the language of the

21

statute dealing with the four months says the

22

administrator shall within four months after the date

23

required for submission of a plan under Paragraph 1.

24

that doesn't appear to refer to any revisions.

25

And

MR. GARRETT:

Now,

1

Subsection (a)(3), that section deals entirely with

2

revisions, and we believe --

3

QUESTION:

But (a)(3) says that the

4

administrator will approve any revision if he determines

5

that it meets the requirements of Paragraph 2.

6

he meets the requirements by acting, but that the plan

7

meets the requirements.

8

9

MR. GARRETT:

Not that

The language of the statute, I

think, Your Honor, we have to be careful not to try to

10

parse it a little bit too fine but to look to the overall

11

intent of it.

12

example where EPA does not interpret the language to refer

13

only to the requirements of the plan.

14

the first sentence of Section (a)(2) states that the

15

administrator may approve or disapprove a plan or a

16

portion of a plan.

17

In our reply brief we pointed out one

And in particular

There is no reference to a portion of a plan in

18

Section (3)(a).

19

service case has said Congress basically intended these

20

two provisions to work the same way and the administrator

21

has the same obligations and responsibilities under (a)(2)

22

as it does under (a)(3).

23

But yet the administrator in the public

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I guess my question is

24

specifically whether you would acknowledge that the

language of the statute could be read as the Solicitor

1

General says it should be read.

2

MR. GARRETT:

Our view, Your Honor, is that the

3

language is intended to be a provision of incorporation,

4

and it's plain, to us anyway, that Congress intended to

5

incorporate all of (a)(2) into (a)(3).

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. GARRETT:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. GARRETT:

But it could be read otherwise?
I don't think so, Your Honor.

No?
I really don't.

I think it's a

10

very strained reading for the government to say that every

11

provision of (a)(2) is incorporated in (a)(3) with the

12

exception of the four-month rule.

13

word almost to see what provisions the government believes

14

are incorporated and which are not, they believe that

15

everything is incorporated except the four-month rule.

16

And if you go word by

I don't think that there's any indication in the

17

statute that Congress intended to carve out that one

18

provision.

19

all of the amici that have filed briefs with this Court

20

are correct in assuming that Congress intended that.

21

And we think that all of the lower courts and

And we think that the proof of the pudding is

22

Section 110(g) of the Act, which we've pointed out in our

23

brief requires EPA to comply with the plan revisions — to

24

act on certain plan revisions, quote, "within the required

25

four-month period," we think clearly referring back to the

basic provision for revisions, which is (a)(3).

QUESTION:

But

it says -- it says the required

(inaudible) what four-month period has been required.
MR. GARRETT:

5

Our position, Your Honor, is that

6

the only reference that's logical is the required period

7

for EPA to act on the revisions under Section (a)(3).
QUESTION:

8

9

But that's — that's a required

period after the -- the SIPs must be submitted.

That was

10

four months after the Act was originally passed -- after

11

the date that the Act required states to submit plans.

12

And as the Act originally passed, it said four months

13

after that date the administrator must have acted on those

14

plans.

A

MR. GARRETT:

16

the statute does --

17

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor, and

That is the only required four-month

18

period.

19

The plans could have been filed before that -- that

20

period, couldn't they?

21

after the Act was passed.

22

indeed have been -- I don't know when the Act was passed,

23

it might have been an eight-month period.

24
25

Four months -- not after the plans were filed.

They could have been filed right
So the four-month period might

It was four months after the plans were required
to be filed, not four months after they were filed.

MR. GARRETT:

I think that the

I

Why isn't that

true?
MR. GARRETT:

It assumes that Congress really

didn't intend that there be prompt action on revisions and

10

that revisions somehow were less important than the

11

original plans.

12

—

Again, Your Honor, there's some

QUESTION:

No.

It just assumes that Congress --

13

that Congress for prompt action relied upon the

14

Administrative Procedure Act which — which assures prompt

15

action in all other areas.

MR. GARRETT:

Let's assume --

And the four-month provision was just

to get this Act off and running really fast.
MR. GARRETT:

That's all.

Let's assume for the moment that

the four-month provision is not applicable and that EPA's

21

duty is to act within a reasonable time.

QUESTION:

what you think that leads to.

ago.

Under the Court's decision in the Train v. NRDC

2

case, EPA must approve a revision if it satisfies the

3

basic requirements of the statute.

4

And what EPA has done here is that they've

5

invented a new option.

What they do is they exercise a

6

pocket veto by ignoring a revision while bringing a suit

7

to enforce the old plan.

8

revision without any of the restrictions on EPA authority

9

that are in the statute.

This, in effect, disapproves the

And indeed, it provides

10

incentives for EPA to delay further in order to advance

11

its enforcement action.
Now, by proceeding in this way, it seems to us,

12

13

that EPA is leaving the states and industry in a

14

regulatory limbo.

15

and enforce revised plans for improved control strategies.

16

It removes any incentives that industry would have to

17

accept and implement revisions that would make progress.

18

And we submit that these consequences are totally

19

inconsistent with the goals of the Act, and they are

20

inconsistent with the basic obligation that EPA has in the

21

statute where it says the administrator shall approve any

22

revision.

23

It undercuts state efforts to develop

And even if it's not four months, even if it's a

MR. GARRETT:

That was the remedy that the court

of appeals suggested — or, at least one of the two

remedies that the court of appeals suggested, Your Honor.

And we respectfully suggest that that's not very

meaningful.

It seems to us that this approach of requiring a

problem that we've got.
QUESTION:

11

The problem, Mr. Garrett, is once you

12

abandon the form -- well, you haven't abandoned it.

13

once you assume I don't agree with -- with your four-

14

month clear line, industry isn't helped very much by

15

simply adopting a reasonable time rule and say that after

16

a reasonable time for approval has elapsed the industry is

17

thereafter excused from -- from complying with the

18

original SIP and -- and can act as though the revised SIP

has been approved.

—

And let me try

MR. GARRETT:

No, Your Honor, we go a step

13

further than that.

Our position is that EPA has a

14

fundamental duty under the statute to first act on the

15

revision, up or down, before it brings an enforcement

16

action.

17

look at whether there was a reasonable time on the four-

18

month rule.

19

important because it underscores the urgency of EPA to

20

act, but there can be no question to us that the statute

21

imposes a mandatory duty on EPA to act on those plans and

22

that they should be prohibited from bringing an

23

enforcement action.

QUESTION:

enforcement actions?

14
15

MR. GARRETT:

Is there any particular provision?
Your Honor, there is not a

particular provision in the sense of language saying that
EPA may not bring an enforcement action.

However, we

16

suggest that -- several things.

17

language in the statute saying that they are obligated to

18

approve, the language in the statute saying in several

19

places — in the preamble to the case and to the statute

20

in the declaration of findings and purpose — that the

21

prevention and control of pollution at its source is the

22

primarily responsibility of the state and local

23

governments, and in Section 7407(a) which says that each

The states don't have that authority if EPA is

State of Massachusetts that we've lodged with the Clerk of

comments with EPA saying that this is a good revision and

QUESTION:

We want this approved.

May I ask this question about the

interplay between the state and the Federal authority?

If

10

you focus on Section 110(g), which provides -- gives the

governor the power to suspend enforcement if he makes the

12

finding that it's necessary to prevent the closing of a

plant and so forth.

14

It seems to me that extra precaution there would

15

be totally unnecessary in view -- if your view of the

basic statutory scheme is correct, that the state could

17

accomplish it without that planning.

18

I'd like you to comment on that portion.

19

MR. GARRETT:

20

two responses to that.

21

disagree on the interpretation of that language of 110(g).

22

We believe that that was an emergency provision that was

23

designed to deal with imminent plant closings and in a

24

situation where the state really couldn't even afford to

25

wait the four months.

Certainly, Your Honor.

MR. GARRETT:

Our position is that the company

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

I would like to preface my remarks by pointing

17

out that the time limitations that were specified in the

Act in 1970 in order to get the states to make prompt

19

submissions and EPA to move on them within four months

20

were designed to get into place protections of the public

health which were not yet in place under the previous

22

versions of the Clean Air Act.

was included in the 1970 Act so that these protections of

The enforcement authority was given both to the

2

EPA and to citizen suits, and citizen suits could also be

brought by the states under the definition of who is a

person in the Act who can bring a citizens' suit.

primary enforcement authority was in the EPA.

the citizen suit can proceed only if the EPA has not

which was to get protections for the breathing public in

I think the court of appeals

of the equities of the particular case will be taken into

account in the penalty proceeding.

10
11

One is that in determining what

And the other is that

mandamus actions do lie to get the EPA to act.
But I must point out that in this case the EPA

arguments that General Motors has here is that your

the fact that you bring a prosecution.

What do you have?

It's just the —

courts to erect a bar to the exercise of the government's

explicit enforcement authority even though no such bar

appears in the text of the statute itself or is adverted

12

to in any way in the legislative history of the Act.

13

Nothing is pointed to that shows that it was at all

14

contemplated by Congress in enacting it.

16

Petitioner hasn't totally renounced it -- that court based

17

this judicially created enforcement bar on EPA's failure

18

to complete regulatory action on a proposed SIP revision

19

within a four-month period supposedly required by the

20

statute even though that alleged four-month requirement

21

also does not appear in the text of the statute and is not

adverted to in any way in the legislative history of the

And yet Massachusetts, the state whose interests

Now, in developing a couple of these points

briefly, there is a sixth point that I hope to make, and

that is that even if it would ever be appropriate for

an enforcement bar in limited circumstances has been

2

provided by Congress in the Act which, under this Court's

3

jurisprudence, cuts more in our favor than against our

point because it shows that Congress, when it thought it

QUESTION:

Is this bill drafted by the same guy

that put in the required four-month period?

(Laughter.)

MR. WALLACE:

And there is another provision

that relates to the issue of this case, and I will read

that sentence to the Court.

"Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, each

MR. GARRETT:

Just a few brief points, Your

Honor.
In response to the last point concerning
emergencies, it should be understood that our position is
that EPA does have authority under a separate provision of
the statute to deal with those, and we would not claim a
bar to deal with those kinds of emergencies.

Our request

for a bar only deals with state implementation plans.
With respect to the commingling point and Mr.
Wallace's comments about the government policy with
respect to the negotiations of a DCO, the negotiations
were simply that the government wanted GM to pay penalties
as a price for getting the SIP revision.

They weren't

asking GM to make any other improvements or do anything
else.

They had just changed their policies on whether or

not SIP revisions could be allowed for these purposes as a
revision or whether a DCO with penalties was the
appropriate remedy.
And I would urge the Court to look at the
Hannish memo — it's a May 1986 memorandum by an EPA
official that we've lodged with the Court.

It

demonstrates the moving target problem in our brief.
Mr. Wallace said that the Cyanamid remedy, or
the temporary bar on enforcement is an extreme remedy.
Well, we would submit to the Court that the mandamus
