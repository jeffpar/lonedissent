MR. LADDISH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This is a tax case, but where are the taxpayers?

The

12

domestic corporations that do business in California and that

13

are assessed and pay the California taxes are not before this

14

Court today.

15

of record here and they are challenging the validity of the

California tax.

Imperial, the foreign corporations which control the domestic

taxpayer corporations.

Counsels employed by those taxpayers are counsel

But today they are on the record as

It is that control which has orchestrated these suits

21

so that taxpayers are not before the Court today.

But once they were in the federal courts and were

2

confronted with a Tax Injunction Act, then they said well, the

Tax Injunction Act can't apply to us because we have no plain,

MR. LADDISH:

They do, in effect, have plain, speedy

MR. LADDISH:

1

Currently there are cases pending in the

2

California state courts where the issues are being raised by

3

subsidiaries —
QUESTION:

4
5

those?

6

those issues?

7

And what position is the state taking on

Is the state saying fine, we're going to litigate

MR. LADDISH:

The state is taking the issue, as to some

8

of them, the state is taking a procedural defense that they

9

did not raise them in the claims for refund.

But in no case

10

is the state claiming that the subsidiaries cannot raise those

11

foreign commerce claims.

12

if we did try to raise that, because —

13
14
15

QUESTION:

And we — we would be unsuccessful

And how about the claim that it costs more

for the parent?
MR. LADDISH:

Those claims are being fully litigated in

16

— in the state courts.

17

believe that is one of the issues where we are claiming that

18

they did not raise that in the — in the claim for refund.

19

QUESTION:

In one case, the Barclay's case, I

Do you think under California state tax law

20

that the state could take the position that it can tax the

21

parent, that the parent's the taxpayer?

MR. LADDISH:

Not under the California state law, Your

Honor, in that the California —

I mean, you

1

MR. LADDISH:

2

QUESTION:

Well, that you can consider worldwide income

3

in levying the tax.

4

MR. LADDISH:

5

No, Your Honor, we do not.

The California statute states that the —

taxpayer is the person subject to the tax.

That doesn't get

6

us anywhere except that the section that does impose the tax,

7

Section 23151 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code,

8

says that — imposes the tax on every corporation doing

9

business in the state.

Now, in these cases the corporations

10

doing business in the state are the domestic subsidiary

11

corporations.

12

stipulations of fact, that the assessments have been made

13

against, those are the corporations that information has been

14

requested from and those are the corporations that we are

15

determining what their — what income should be attributed to

16

their California business.

17

And those are the corporations, under the

Now, in determining that, California does turn to the

18

income of the unitary business, and looks to the whole unitary

19

business in order to make the apportionment.

20

levied on that corporate entity, and the Franchise Tax Board

21

deals with that corporate entity in its tax procedures.

22

the Container case, this Court recognized that, although

23

California counts income arguably attributable to foreign

24

corporations in calculating the tax — taxable income of that

25

domestic corporation, the legal incidence of the tax falls on

But the tax is

In

1

that domestic corporation.

2

And as a final touch to consider, if that corporation

3

did not pay the tax, under California law there was no means

4

for us to go after the foreign parent corporation.

5

corporation that has the tax liability, and if that

6

corporation goes insolvent we must file claims in the — in

the bankruptcy of that corporation.

8

provisions that that is not really the taxpayer after all, and

9

we can go after anyone else.

10

It is that

But there are no

So we submit that the foreign parents, having let their

11

subsidiaries keep their California procedures lying fallow

12

while going to the foreign -- the federal courts, that this is

13

a forum shopping, a form of forum shopping that strikes at the

14

very heart of the federalism that Congress meant to preserve

15

in the Tax Injunction Act.

16

California of its tax remedies, which Congress meant to

17

protect in the Tax Injunction Act, and subjects California to

18

the expense and peril of litigating the ultimate

19

constitutional validity of its tax structure, regardless of

20

whether the tax has been paid, against nontaxpayers, in

21

actions where California would not have the other procedural

22

or other substantive defenses or issues it might raise against

23

the taxpayer itself.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

MR. LADDISH:

You may resume, Mr. Laddish.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

You will

basic tax structure in a distant federal forum which has

absolutely no familiarity with the procedural or substantive

nature of California tax law.

The threat that this might

10

California in asking this Court to recognize this threat for

11

what it is and give it the fate that it deserves under the Tax

12

Injunction Act.

13

The Tax Injunction Act has quite clear language to

14

avoid such forum shopping as we see today.

15

corporations cannot get the declarative or injunctive relief

16

that they seek if — where a plain, speedy and efficient

17

remedy may be had in the courts of the state.

18

the Grace Brethren case, recognized that, at the time of the

19

Tax Injunction Act's enactment, Congress was well aware that

20

tax refund procedures were the sole remedy offered in many

21

states, and in the same case this Court recognized that

22

California's tax refund remedy, in a similar statute and

23

another tax, provided a plain, speedy and efficient remedy.

Under a very strict reading of the Tax Injunction Act

suits, for at least some interpretation must be had -- given

2

to the language to add the requirement that anyone other than

3

the taxpayer have a plain, speedy and efficient — remedy.

4

a requirement were to be read into the statute that the party

5

bringing the federal action must, in effect, have a plain,

6

speedy and efficient remedy in the California courts, that

7

requirement would be met here.

9

If

In order to protect the state's finances, the State of
California offers its remedy in the usual tax refund form.

10

This is, by its form, limited to the taxpayers.

11

limitation, though reasonable by itself, could arguably lead

12

to inapplicability of the Tax Injunction Act if the parties

13

before the court, the federal court, only could rely upon the

14

hope of persuading the taxpayers in the state courts to raise

15

certain issues or to raise them in a certain way.

16

not the case before the Court today.

17

That

But that is

Here we have the sole stockholders of the taxpayers in

18

California, and those stockholders do not need to rely upon

19

the hope of persuasion.

20

They have the certainty of control.

The result of barring these actions under the Tax

21

Injunction Act is not only consistent with the language, it is

22

fully consistent with the purpose underlying the act, which

23

was to limit drastically federal court^jurisdiction to

interfere with the lifeblood intense local concern of the

states in the assessment and collection of their own state

In furtherance of this purpose, this Court, in the

Now, in further answer to the question as to whether

The issue before the Court today is the

it only stands to reason as common sense, that the subsidiary

If the tax is

When we move to the standing issue, the subsidiary

taxpayer's ability to raise all the issue pertaining to the

19

Under the stockholder standing rule a stockholder will not

QUESTION:

May I -- may I give you a hypothetical case

3
4

MR. LADDISH:

5

QUESTION:

Sure.

— that I have been thinking about?

6

Supposing the subsidiary's tax would be the same whether you

7

use the unitary business approach or their, you could somehow

8

or other isolate them, if they claimed it was

9

unconstitutional.

But there really didn't make any difference

10

in the tax obligation of the subsidiary, and therefore

11

arguably it wouldn't have standing to raise all sorts of

12

constitutional issues.

13

in such a case the state's insistence on following the unitary

14

approach would pose a lot of burdens on your adversaries here

15

that were not imposed on the taxpayer, and that there would no

16

forum in which that particular claim could be litigated?

17

MR. LADDISH:

Might it, nevertheless, be true that

Still, if, as to the validity of the tax,

18

I believe, since California is not only taxing the —

19

corporation that is doing business in California, it is asking

20

that corporation for all the information pertaining to the

21

assessment of the tax.

22

the direct request or demand made upon it by the Franchise Tax

23

Board, and that corporation would have the standing still to

24

challenge, if — if we're talking about whether the tax is

25

valid because of administrative burdens --

It would even if it didn't affect its tax —

not this corporation would need to supply the information, or

The stockholder standing rule here clearly applies

didn't get the word and still assessed a tax on Alcancorp

taking into account all of Alcan's income, and asking

Just as clearly, as I mentioned before, pure common

sense says that the corporation itself would have standing to

reasons justifying the departure, any departure from the use

Mr. Laddish, or perhaps found isn't the right word, maybe

held, that the corporations here did sustain a different kind

19

of injury from the taxpayer?

20

MR. LADDISH:

The Seventh Circuit, Your Honor, mixed

21

the merits with the standing issue, when considering the

22

standing issue forgot to consider the strong issues of

23

federalism that we can maintain underlie both the standing

24

issue and the Tax Injunction Act issue in this case, and did

interfered with here, and these people are in foreign

It is submitted that that injury is not

It certainly would fit under the stockholder

And certainly I think it could be raised by the

clause.
But, under Article III standing, when boiled down to

12

its essence, that, that injury, as found by the Seventh

13

Circuit, is really that if a state imposes any tax upon a

14

subsidiary, why, then, that — the subsidiary's parent,

15

whether it is an interstate or foreign commerce, would feel

16

this burden upon its decision making as to whether to do

17

business in that state through the use of the subsidiary.

18

It is submitted that that is basically saying

19

corporation don't like standing and, to borrow a term from

20

First Amendment cases, if you impose a — tax on a corporation

21

and its parent is doing business in interstate or foreign

22

commerce, that is a chilling effect on interstate and foreign

23

commerce.

Moving back to the stockholder standing rule itself,

3

this Court in Hawes v. Oakland, more than 100 years ago,

4

decided that it was perfectly appropriate to apply the

5

stockholder standing rule to prevent forum shopping through

6

the abuse of federal diversity jurisdiction.

7

this Court, in the Shindley Corporation case, held that it was

8

particularly appropriate to apply the stockholder standing

9

rule when there was a situation where you had sole

these policy currents that we have seen from prior cases, show

that the stockholder standing rule as applied in this case

that application would be supported by the same concerns that

of federalism which recognize the imperative need of the state

4

reason that that injury should be rejected is that, under this

that has to do with the requirement, Article III requirement,

9

there some decision that is uniquely our decision that has

10

been infringed?

What the Seventh Circuit said is, in the

violation of an understanding between the United States, a

18

course of conduct exemplified in some treaties and exemplified

19

merits confers standing to the extent that, yes, it is true

2

there must be a foreign commerce injury.
QUESTION:

3

The Seventh Circuit said we are only going

4

to apply this where foreign commerce is involved.

5

logically, why should it be limited?

6

foreign commerce to this particular question of standing,

7

other than the arguments on the merits?
MR. SALIBRA:

But

What is peculiar about

Well, I — my analysis of that would be

very simply that it — that one could, I think, make the

10

argument that you suggested.

its subsidiary, regardless of whether it is a foreign unity or

12

an American — or a U.S. unity, the shareholder role no longer

15

one common element of a single business.

16

you are saying.

17

to that — am I correct?

The shareholder role has been defeated, because he is

When you unitize a company with

Yeah.

And, I guess my an — I guess I am

The question is why is it tied to the merits?

QUESTION:

Yes.

You know, you say the Seventh Circuit

says we won't apply this except in the area of foreign

commerce.

limit that principle to foreign commerce, other than something

25

to do with these treaties you are talking about, which are

basically questions of the merits.
MR. SALIBRA:

2

Well, Your Honor, I don't disagree with

3

that.

I guess I am saying I agree with you.

They limit it to

4

foreign commerce.

5

whenever the shareholder role has been eliminated, whenever

6

the shareholder isn't being treated like a shareholder any

7

longer, then the — then one is precluded from coming in when

8

he wants to vindicate a right and say you can't come in

9

because you are a shareholder.

I think it is logically possible to say

I agree with that.

That is

10

not what the Seventh Circuit said.

It said there were reasons

11

why it was limiting it to foreign commerce.

12

to the extent that a shareholder is not — is suffering an

13

injury that is not derivative through his role as a

14

shareholder, he should have a right of action, is in fact the

15

fundamental principle that all of us recognize.

16

that.

17

shareholders who suffer injury, Universal -- Schaffer v.

Universal Rundle, that shareholders who suffer injury, and

19

that injury is not injury that derives from their shareholder

20

position but is unique and personal to them, have a right of

21

action.

But I agree that,

I agree with

There is established law on that principle that

And I agree that that is a rational position.

22

The important point, I think, in this case, from the

23

point of view of some of the foreign parents, is that, as I

24

said, is that in this case once you decide we are not a

25

shareholder — or, I am sorry, that we are a shareholder, and

that is the only derivative impact we see from the unitary

informed yes, it can be litigated in state court.

that is true, why isn't that sufficient?

13

MR. SALIBRA:

Now, if

I

think the issue is if there is a determination by this Court

MR. SALIBRA:

We are finished.

I am saying that if you hold that there

QUESTION:

The state is quite willing to assume you do

The state says that

these very issues, even though you have standing, these very

issues can be litigated in the state courts.

MR. SALIBRA:

And the — and our answer is the fact

7

that the -- assuming that the issues could be litigated,

8

assuming the issues could be litigated, the Tax Injunction Act

9

still wouldn't apply.

10

QUESTION:

Why not?

11

MR. SALIBRA:

And it wouldn't apply because of the

12

uniform recognition of this Court and those courts, every

13

court in this case which applied that doctrine, that absent

not bar the action of another party without a remedy.
