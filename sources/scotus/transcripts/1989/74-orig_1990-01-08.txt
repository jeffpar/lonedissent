ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA T. BARMEYER

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
MS. BARMEYER:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This original action was initiated by Georgia in

11

12

1977 in order to resolve disputes concerning the boundary

13

between Georgia and South Carolina in the lower Savannah

River, the mouth of the river and the lateral seaward

boundary.

exceptions to the reports of the Special Master.

Both Georgia and South Carolina have filed

In order to outline the exceptions, I'd like to

QUESTION:

It may take more than that.

15

MS. BARMEYER:

Before I go to the specific areas

16

in dispute, I'd like to remind the Court of the

17

controlling document here, which is the Treaty of Beaufort

18

in 1787, which was entered into by Georgia and South

19

Carolina.

20

QUESTION:

Is the whole — is the entire treaty

anywhere in your briefs?
MS. BARMEYER:

Yes, sir.

It is Appendix A,

actually Articles 1 and Articles 2 are Appendix A to

24

Georgia's brief and exceptions.

But that's not the entire treaty.

Is

1

the entire treaty anywhere in the briefs?
MS. BARMEYER:

2

3

It is in evidence, Your Honor,

and those exhibits have been sent to the Court.
By the treaty, the boundary between Georgia and

4
5

South Carolina is the most northern branch or stream of

6

the river, expressly reserving all islands in the river to

7

Georgia.
This Court had occasion to consider the Treaty

8

9

of Beaufort in the case of Georgia v. South Carolina in

10

1922, and the Court further explicated that boundary and

11

determined that the boundary is the geographic middle of

12

the boundary stream, irrespective of the navigation

13

channel or thalweg of the river.

14

that all islands in the Savannah River are in Georgia.

15

The Court reaffirmed

The Court also stated in 1922 that the boundary

16

stream may be narrow and shallow and insignificant, as

17

compared to the main body of the river, but that doesn't

18

matter if it is the northernmost branch or stream of the

19

river.

20

Now, first I would like to direct your attention

21

to the Barnwell Island area.

22

downstream from the city of Savannah, and on this map it

23

is directly north of the inset map, which is simply a

24

slightly larger view of the Barnwell Island area.

That's a curious way of putting that,

evulsive actions of the Corps of Engineers.

I didn't know

they were engaged in evulsion.
MS. BARMEYER:

11

Well, Your Honor, they have

12

evulsed up and down the Savannah River.

13

the boundary stream by the creation of dams which blocked

14

off the northernmost branch or stream of the river, and

And

the Special Master agreed with that.

Because it is a sudden change rather

than a gradual one that comes from accretion.
MS. BARMEYER:

That is right, Your Honor.

That

is correct.

it?

I mean, would just building a jetty out into the flow

2

constitute evulsion?

3

not evulsion but accretion further downstream?

4

accretion should happen because of the jetty, that

5

wouldn't be called evulsion, would it?
MS. BARMEYER:

6

That is right, Your Honor.

The

distinction, we believe, between evulsion, which we had in

8

this case, and accretion is accretion is the deposit of

9

material by the gradual action — by the water dropping

11
12

sediment.
QUESTION:

Even if that water has been diverted

by a jetty or some action by the Corps of Engineers.

MS. BARMEYER:

QUESTION:

15

MS. BARMEYER:

16

QUESTION:

That is correct.

It would still be accretion.
That is correct.

In this case what we had was the

17

Corps of Engineers dredging material from the river bottom

18

and placing it blocking the — this boundary stream.

19

With Barnwell Island, the issue is prescription

20

and acquiescence.

which are primarily transactions by and among members of

22

continued reiteration of the Treaty provisions that all

2

islands are in Georgia, and in spite of actions by the

3

United States and actions by the State of Georgia on maps

and other official actions showing Barnwell Island in

5

Georgia.
Moving downstream to the next areas in dispute,

there are two areas of made land on the north shore of the

Savannah River which South Carolina has excepted — where

South Carolina has excepted to the Master's recommended

line.

11

Georgia's exceptions, but there are two places.

12

to the left or upstream of Jones Island, where the

13

boundary line crosses on to the northern bank, and then

14

another area downstream of Jones Island, which is called

15

Horseshoe Shoal, although, again, it is not labeled here.

16

They are not labeled here, since this went with

Both upstream and downstream there are these two

areas of made land.

result the boundary did not move.

excepted to that recommendation.
The next area I would like to direct your

3

attention to is Oyster Bed Island, which is at the point

4

where the yellow line and the red line diverge.

The Special — Georgia contends that it is in

11

Georgia, either because all islands are in Georgia, even

12

if they formed after the Treaty of Beaufort, so long as
r

13

they formed naturally, or, in the alternative, that Oyster

14

Bed Island must be in Georgia because it is south of the

15

geographic middle between the islands that were in

16

existence in 1787, which is Cockspur Island, Georgia, just

17

to the south, and Turtle Island, Georgia -- Turtle Island,

18

South Carolina.

19

The Special Master was following a geographic

20

middle in this — his yellow line, until he got to the

21

point at the southern tip of Turtle Island, when he,

22

rather inexplicably we contend, jumped from a geographic

23

middle boundary to delineation of a boundary in the

24

navigation stream — navigation channel of the river.

QUESTION:

Did he give any explanation at all

for his change?

2

MS. BARMEYER:

His conclusion was that the

3

decision in 1922 that the thalweg did not apply, he

4

concluded that that did not control in the mouth of the

5

river area.

6

had the navigation channel in mind when they drew the

7

treaty.
QUESTION:

10

the way it did.
MS. BARMEYER:

I think that is correct, Your

Honor.

13
14

Well, if Oyster Bed Island hadn't

come into being, this line probably wouldn't have jigged

11
12

And he concluded that the framers must have

QUESTION:

Well, but he had to choose which side

of the island to go on, didn't he?

15

MS. BARMEYER:

16

QUESTION:

That is right.

And which side to — he did go

17

halfway between Oyster Bed Island and some other place,

didn't he?

Between Oyster Bed Island and

Roughly, he did, Your Honor.

Well, why shouldn't he do that rather

than go on the north side of Oyster -- Oyster Bed Island?
MS. BARMEYER:

1

that the geography in 1855 was what was controlling.

And

2

using that theory and using his theory that he was going

3

to follow the 1922 decision so long as there were islands

4

in the river, I think he necessarily should have continued

5

that geographic middle, at least until he passed Cockspur

6

Island, Georgia, which everybody concedes is an island in

7

the Savannah River and in Georgia.

8

continued that a little bit further to the eastern end of

9

Cockspur Island then, although we would have disagreed

If he had only

10

with it, he could then have made a dog leg to the

11

navigation channel of the river, and Oyster Bed Island

12

would have been in Georgia rather than in South Carolina.

13

QUESTION:

Ms. Barmeyer, is it — is it true

14

that he would have, would not have done this if Oyster

15

Island didn't exist?

I am under the impression he would

16

have done it anyway.

I thought that he was regarding the

17

shoal that is north of Oyster Bed Island as the substitute

18

for a headland in defining the mouth of the river, and

19

that the reason he went into the navigation channel at

20

that point is simply effectively he was saying that is

21

where the river ends.

22

MS. BARMEYER:

That's further east, Your Honor -

23
24
25

QUESTION:

And he would have done that whether

the island was there or not.

MS. BARMEYER:

1

In that area, that's the mouth of

2

the river.

But that's further east.

If I could get you

3

to follow his line a little further east, you see Tybee

4

Island, Georgia.

5

just north of Tybee Island, and he referred to a large

6

prominent shoal opposite Tybee Island, and did, I believe,

7

more or less substitute that shoal for headland.

8

decision really had nothing to do with the Oyster Bed

9

Island area.

He found that the mouth of the river was

But that

Georgia contends that he should have stayed in

10
11

the geographic middle throughout the boundary waters, that

12

he should have determined the line based on the nearest

13

point in Georgia and the nearest point in South Carolina

14

until he reached the seaward limit of the internal waters

15

of Georgia.

16

QUESTION:

And what is that limit, in your view?

17

MS. BARMEYER:

I would direct your attention,

18

Justice Stevens, to this oblique line that goes from

19

Hilton Head Island —

20

QUESTION:

I know, you think the mouth of the

21

river is Hilton Head at the north and Tybee Island at the

22

south.

23

MS. BARMEYER:

That is right.

That is certainly

24

the closest point in — South Carolina and the closest

25

point in Georgia.

1

Do the parties agree that the Tybee

Island is — is the point from which you measure the

southern boundary of the mouth of the river?

MS. BARMEYER:
that.

The parties are in agreement on

They are in agreement on that?
Yes, sir.

So you either have to draw a rather

horizontal line or else go up to Hilton Head.
MS. BARMEYER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

All

11

the record and evidence of the 18th century perception was

12

that the framers understood the mouth to be at Tybee

13

rather than in this Oyster Bed Island area.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

And your position is the mouth is the

entire area between Hilton Head and Tybee?
MS. BARMEYER:

That is right.

Even if the

17

entire area is not technically the mouth, it is our

18

position that the 1922 case said you don't look at the

19

thalweg, you don't look at the navigation channel, you

20

find the geographic middle between the island shore in

21

Georgia and the closest point in South Carolina, and that

22

you can draw a very simple — simply plotted geographical

23

mathematical line by using those closest points.

24

this case it would be Turtle Island, South Carolina,

25

Daufuskie Island, South Carolina and Hilton Head Island.

MS. BARMEYER:

It's an arm of the sea.

It is a

place where these waters enter and flow out, and it flows

around Tybee Island.

sound and the entrance to two other rivers, whether

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA T. BARMEYER

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

11

MS. BARMEYER:

Thank you, Your Honor.

12

Georgia agrees with the point made by the Chief

13

Justice that South Carolina must show prescription and

14

acquiescence as of 1953, because, of course, otherwise it

15

would be defeated by the action taken by Georgia in

16

intervening and pursuing the case, the condemnation case

17

that went to the Fifth Circuit.

18

The question is, as of 1953, was there the

19

cumulative notoriety that's required in the cases to

20

change the location of Barnwell Island from Georgia to

21

South Carolina?

22

Was there any notice to Georgia?

Now, Georgia asserted to the Fifth Circuit that

23

Georgia did not know that the boundary was in dispute,

because South Carolina had never made any claim to

that South Carolina appeared on the scene and said yes, we

5

QUESTION:

That was the first time

As of 1955 —

But South Carolina had been on the

scene all along, because that's been where the deeds were

7

recorded and the taxes were paid, and this land was being

obviously used.

MS. BARMEYER:

Deeds were recorded and taxes

10

were paid in South Carolina, but those are primarily

passive acts by the clerk of court.

QUESTION:

3

Well, is there any place — is there

any other Georgia land that pays taxes to South Carolina?
MS. BARMEYER:

4

There may well be, Your Honor.

5

At least until the 20th century and the '60s, when the

6

clerks were able to get these photogrammetric tax maps

7

where you could really superimpose the property boundaries

8

on the land, in Georgia and other states that were not

9

granted, and South Carolina, that.were granted randomly

10

with irregular parcels, there wasn't a chart that somebody

11

could go to to see whether or not this township, this

12

range, whether or not the land had been granted, whether

13

or not taxes had been paid.

14

I think it's key that South Carolina did not

15

even know of the grant by South Carolina to this land.
