ORAL ARGUMENT OF CAROL CONNOR FLOWE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MS. FLOWE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

This case concerns PBGC's efforts to protect the

12

integrity of the government insurance program that insures

13

the pensions of more than 30 million American workers.

14

At issue is the scope of the agency's statutory

15

authority to restore a terminated pension plan.

16

discuss how the language of the statute, its legislative

17

history, and PBGC's policy considerations each support its

18

use of that statutory authority in this case.

19

I will

We begin, of course, with the language of the

20

statute itself.

21

to restore a terminated pension plan and I quote, "In any

22

case in which the corporation," that is, the PBGC,

23

"determines such action to be appropriate and consistent

24

with its duties under Title IV of ERISA."

25

In Section 4047 Congress authorized PBGC

Now, Congress could have said that PBGC could

\

1

restore a terminated pension plan only if an employer's

2

financial condition had improved.

3

that PBGC could restore a plan where it could persuade a

4

court that doing so was in the public interest.

5

didn't.

Or it could have said

But it

What Congress said was -- was that PBGC should

6

7

make this determination, and it limited our discretion

8

only by requiring that we exercise it appropriately and

9

consistently with our statutory duties.
The court of appeals slid right by the statutory

10
11

language though and went immediately to the legislative

12

history.

13

history to see whether there was a clearly expressed

14

legislative intent contrary to PBGC's action in this case,

15

the court of appeals turned the analysis on its head.

16

And then, rather than examining the legislative

The court of appeals searched the legislative

17

materials for an explicit reference to the use of

18

restoration that PBGC made here.

19

found none because the legislative history confirms what

20

the plain language of the statute says, that Congress

21

intended PBGC to determine when its restoration authority

22

was to be used.

23

Not surprisingly, it

This legislative history is sparse, but it's

24

straightforward.

It says that Congress intended PBGC to

25

restore a plan if a plan or employer had a favorable

1

reversal of business trends or if, and again I quote,

2

"some other factor made termination no longer advisable."
The court of appeals simply disregarded this

3
4

final phrase and focused instead on the one example given

5

-- a favorable reversal of business trends.

6

then concluded that was the only circumstance under which

7

the agency could restore a terminated pension plan.

8

approach was contrary to this Court's teachings in Chevron

9

and its progeny.

That

And it also --

QUESTION:

10

The court

May I interrupt you for a moment?

It

11

would help me if I understood why the termination decision

12

was reversed in this case.
MS. FLOWE:

13

There were two reasons, Justice

14

Stevens.

15

on plans, new pension arrangements which, when combined

16

with the insurance payments that PBGC was paying under

17

these terminated plans, effectively continued the

18

terminated plan as if there had been no termination but —

19

The first reason was because LTV adopted follow-

QUESTION:

Well — this is what I really need

20

some help on because the briefs somehow gloss over the

21

facts, just as you did in starting out with the statute.

22

What does that mean?

Does that mean that

23

someone who was getting a pension under the old plan

24

that's being financed now by your client could get a

25

pension under the new plan too?

MS. FLOWE:

In effect, yes, Justice Stevens.

What it means is that -QUESTION:

Well, how could that be?

If they —

if they were already returned from a closed plan or

something like that, how could they earn a right to a new

MS. FLOWE:

I don't

Under the statutory scheme that

Congress established here, PBGC doesn't pay all benefits

10

under an underfunded terminated plan.

11

that we would pay only certain basic benefits, and even

12

those are limited by a statutory maximum.

Congress specified

The follow-on plan makes up the nonguaranteed,

14

QUESTION:

It also

Let me just be sure I understand -Sure.
-- just to get an example.
Sure.
In other words, if there's a closed

21

plant, the people qualified for retirement benefits

22

because the plant was closed and they lost their jobs and

23

they were getting pensions and then they -- you terminate

24

the plan so PBGC pays part of the benefits and the LTV

25

finances the balance.

Is that how it worked?

And now those same people will get

benefits under the follow-up plan?

MS. FLOWE:

QUESTION:

6

7

That's correct.

That's correct.

Well, how can they earn benefits if

they've already retired?
MS.

They will —

FLOWE:

That's what puzzled me.

Well, suppose — let's take a

8

numerical example and suppose we have a retiree who was

9

receiving a pension of, let's say, $800 a month —

10

QUESTION:

Right.

11

MS. FLOWE: -- under the pension plan that

12

terminates.

Because of our various statutory limitations,

13

we may pay only $600 --

14

QUESTION:

Right.

15

MS. FLOWE:

-- of that $800.

The follow-on plan

16

would pay the remaining $200 or some substantial portion

17

of that remaining $200.

18

QUESTION:

I see.

And the follow-up plan covers

19

people who have already retired and are receiving benefits

20

under the old plan.

21

MS. FLOWE:

22

QUESTION:

23

MS. FLOWE:

It covers those people —
I see.
-- and it also covers active workers

24

who might have had a vested benefit under the old plan in

25

a certain amount.

But once the old plan terminated, that

But you had to pay his vested?
That's correct, Justice White.

We

would pay the amount of the benefit that was accrued and

vested as of the date of termination.

7

would allow that same employee to continue earning

additional benefits and to continue earning service for

QUESTION:

MS. FLOWE:

9

QUESTION:

From the follow-on plan.
All right.
That's correct.
When -- when you say that the PBGC

10

pays vested benefits, you don't necessarily mean up to the

11

full amount of the vested benefit?

12

to whatever limitations there are, or are there no

13

limitations on the vested benefits?

14

MS. FLOWE:

You still mean subject

It's rather complicated, Justice

15

Scalia, but in most cases we would pay the full vested

benefit at the time that employee reaches his retirement

age.

2

QUESTION:

3

MS. FLOWE:

Right.
— if an employee is already — or a

4

retiree -- is already eligible for a shutdown benefit at

5

the time that a plan terminates, he will not receive the

6

full amount of that benefit, even though it might

7

otherwise be vested, because it will exceed the amount

8

that we would guarantee by some fairly substantial amount.

9

QUESTION:

Okay.

And what you just described to

10

Justice Stevens as being the consequence is only the

11

consequence because of the particular deal struck by the

12

union with the corporation here.

13

Conceivably, the union could have said, listen

14

people that are already retired, tough luck, we'll --

15

we'll let them just get what — what the Pension Benefit

16

Corporation pays them.

But in this case it was both, both

The follow-on plan policy grew out of a need to

do all of these things -- to discourage unwarranted

terminations so as to protect the program; to make sure

that these disincentives to termination from the

standpoint of employees and their unions continue to be

maintained in the statutory scheme.

13

QUESTION:

Ms. Flowe, may I ask you whether the

14

benefit -- Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation takes the

15

position that it can order restoration based solely on the

16

existence -- coming into existence of what it thinks is an

17

abusive follow-on plan or must it also include in the

18

calculus whether the company can -- can financially absorb

19

the cost on restoration?

20

MS. FLOWE:

Justice O'Connor, the grant of

21

authority under Section 4047 is unusually broad.

22

-- and -- and it is the agency's position that follow-on

23

plan abuse alone is a sufficient basis under that

24

provision --

25

QUESTION:

However,

Even though the company clearly

1

cannot pay the costs, so that it's going to result in some

2

kind of immediate retermination action one way or another?
MS. FLOWE:

3

Well, whether the company can pay or

4

not, first of all, does not necessarily equate with the

5

immediate retermination.

6

significant risk at all of any immediate retermination

7

because the plan —

Here, for example, there was no

position, and the position you take is it makes absolutely

10

no difference what their economic condition is, that if

11

there is an agreement to what you call an abusive follow-

12

on plan, you can order restoration.

13

MS. FLOWE:

At least where, as here, there is no

14

significant risk that doing so would be futile because

15

there might be an immediate retermination.

16

QUESTION:

Well, that just doesn't answer the

17

question at all.

18

three things existed and they were -- all three were

19

relied on.

20

Now, here there was a determination that

Were they not?
MS. FLOWE:

We did have three grounds here.

The

21

third ground is -- is subsumed within the first two.

22

we did also make a determination that restoration was

23

warranted here because of the company's improved financial

24

circumstances.

QUESTION:

But

1

determination was not adequately supported on the record?

2

Does that mean it would have to be remanded so that the

3

agency could think about it again?

4

MS. FLOWE:

I think not, Justice O'Connor.

I

5

believe that the Court could reverse the court of appeals

6

on the follow-on abuse question because there was no

7

significant chance of — of immediate retermination here.

8

And please let me explain why.

9

When these plans were restored, they had then

10

sufficient assets to continue for at least several

11

additional years without any further contributions

12

whatsoever.

13

determination here that the company could afford to fund

14

these plans at least for the foreseeable future.

15

In addition, the agency did make a

That finding was not seriously challenged by the

wrong test, that we had to make a finding of long-term

It simply believed that it was the

QUESTION:

Well, what standard for a financial

improvement did the PBGC apply to evaluate the situation?
MS. FLOWE:

On the separate ground of the

22

improved financial circumstances warranting restoration,

23

what PBGC looked at was the factors that had led it to

24

determine these plans in the first instance.

25

several financial factors that caused PBGC to exercise its

There were

1

discretion under Section 4042 of ERISA to terminate these

2

plans to protect the insurance program against the risk of

3

unreasonably large losses.

4

LTV's financial condition did improve over the

5

next several months leading each of those factors to cease

6

to exist.

7

because those factors —

10
11

That fact is really undisputed in this case

QUESTION:

Did you consider whether the tax

waivers that had been granted by IRS in the past would be
extended in the future?
MS. FLOWE:

We did, Your Honor, assume that in

12

making our determination that they had the ability to fund

13

at least for the short-term.

14

that the IRS would grant the company waivers of the --

15
16
17

QUESTION:

We did make an assumption

If that assumption were unwarranted

would the finding be unwarranted?
MS. FLOWE:

No, Your Honor, it would not,

18

because if that assumption were unwarranted, their ongoing

19

contribution obligation would have been a smaller amount.

20

Those past due contributions, rather than being amortized

21

into their current contribution obligation, would have

22

been paid as a part of their plan of reorganization a few

23

years down the road.

24

assumption that made the amount of their contribution

25

obligation slightly higher.

That was actually a conservative

1

But in any event, the assumption --

2

QUESTION:

Well, if -- if there were a waiver,

3

would that affect whether or not the past due obligation

4

was a pre-petition or a post-petition debt?
MS. FLOWE:

5

In our view, Justice Kennedy, a --

6

once there was a waiver granted the amount of the

7

amortization payment which was then — which would then

8

have been due as a part of the ongoing contribution, would

9

have been entitled to administrative expense treatment.
QUESTION:

10

11

debt then?

12

MS. FLOWE:

13

QUESTION:

14

So it would not be a pre-petition

That's correct.
If it -- and if there were no waiver,

would it be a pre-petition debt as to the '84-'85?
MS. FLOWE:

15

At least as to the '84-'85

contributions, those would have continued to have been

17

treated as pre-petition debts.

MS. FLOWE:

We think not, Justice White.

Certainly, we considered the fact that LTV was in

bankruptcy here and in fact we first objected to these

follow-on plans in a bankruptcy court proceeding.

MS. FLOWE:

We were simply —

No?

We were -- we were in fact a

creditor, but we were there exercising our regulatory

authority to say that these follow-on plans --

approval of the plan?

MS. FLOWE:

QUESTION:

16

MS. FLOWE:

Well, we did —
Of the follow-up plan?
Well, we did in fact appeal.

And I

17

might add that the bankruptcy court did not reach the

18

merits of our objections.

19

instead that it wasn't appropriate for him to consider the

20

regulatory objections we were making and that if we

21

thought we had some administrative options, we should go

22

exercise those.

23

The bankruptcy court said

We, nevertheless, appealed his refusal to

24

consider the merits of that matter.

LTV moved to dismiss

25

our appeal on the grounds that it was interlocutory.

while this -- at the same time, we were also considering

a fair thing to do?.

They did not.

They did not.

were no objections other than PBGC's to the funding of

these follow-on plans in the context of that case.

Yes, but even if -- even if you had

Well, why wouldn't you be entitled to

MS. FLOWE:

If they were financially sound and

12

were able to pay each and ever creditor 100 cent on the

13

dollar, we would get only, even then, 75 percent because

that is the amount of the statutory liability under the

money back that way and your position that they are

financially able to handle the plan.

17

MS. FLOWE:

Well, not necessarily, Your Honor,

18

because our claim would be an immediate lump sum

20

underfunding, whereas the company's obligation under

22

statutory minimum funding obligation, which in this case

23

is more like $200 to $225 to $250 million a year as

compared to our claim, which is for about $2 billion.

believe that follow-on plan abuse alone is a sufficient

ground under the statute, under this broad grant of

authority, provided that it will --

Oh, it may be.

the Court:
Contrary to the government's position, this case

3

is not about the integrity of the insurance fund, nor is

4

it about conspiracies between employers and unions to give

5

liabilities to the government.

6

Our position is simply stated.

Nothing in ERISA

7

bars the negotiation of replacement benefits after a plan

8

termination.

9

the Taft-Hartley Act and the Bankruptcy Code support the

10
11

And indeed, both ERISA and the policies of

negotiation of those benefits.
And secondly, nothing in this record supports

12

the conclusion of the government that LTV's financial

improvement -- financial condition had improved in the few

14

months between termination in January 1987 and restoration

that September.

In our view, the question --

Do you -- Mr. Kaden, you say then

that even the abuse of follow-up -- follow-on plans that

MR. KADEN:

Should not, in the absence of

The question in this case -- what this case

really involves is a question whether this government

agency for restoring a pension plan for the first time in

its brief history met the requirements of the

Did they develop a record adequate for review?

their assumptions?

13

Did they proceed

Did they have evidence to support

Did they consider each relevant

factor?
QUESTION:

Will you find all of those

requirements in the Administrative Procedure Act?
MR. KADEN:

Yes.

As -- as this Court has said

in Overton Park and State Farm, in reviewing informal

think the structure of the act itself makes clear that the

nothing to do with the restoration power and is not

But if there's any doubt about that, let's look

at the conflicting mandates of other important Federal

statutes, and let's start with the Taft-Hartley Act.

8

Section 8(d) of the labor law, as you know, says that an

employer must bargain over wages, hours, terms and

10

conditions of employment.
We know that retirement benefits are within that

12

circle of mandatory bargaining.

that it is a serious act to circumscribe the ambit of

We were prepared to pay that $70 million ourselves and we

7

MR. KADEN:

If they were successful in

reinstating the plan, two things might happen, and it

turns on whether the contributions are owing or not by a

10

debtor in possession, whether they are pre-petition

11

obligations or not.

12

There's no question that with the passage of

13

time the unfunded liability in these plans is now over $3

14

billion, and if they were returned to us today, the

15

question is do we have to make those contributions?

16

If we do, our creditors would be forced under

17

the Bankruptcy Code to evaluate whether liquidation was

18

better than paying that bill.

19

would automatically be reterminated under Section 4041 of

20

ERISA, under the voluntary termination standards.

In liquidation, the plans

By contrast, if we didn't have to pay those

MR. KADEN:

8

9

We don't think the harmonizing of

those three statutes could have intended that result.

6

Well, why —

I mean, in terms of figures.
For two reasons.

One, in the

intervening time between the time they restored -- they

10

tried to restore these plans or they terminated these

11

plans and today, the law changed to give them 100 percent

12

claim instead of a 75 percent claim.
And, two, over the course of time benefits have

13
14

been paid out, no contributions go in, some of the

15

liabilities have been reduced, but other liabilities

accrue.

the liability year by year over time.

things have happened to cause that gap to widen.

and the second is the change in the law to give them 100

2

percent claim in bankruptcy as opposed to a 75 percent

3

claim in bankruptcy.

4

QUESTION:

Indeed —
Well, but wouldn't they be entitled

5

to some increase over 2 million just by virtue of the fact

6

of the passage of time from the --

7

MR. KADEN:

No, because the size of their claim

on termination is fixed on the date of termination.

In

other words, at the moment they terminated these plans in

10

January 1987, assuming this Court affirms and the plans

11

remain terminated, that claim, which is roughly $2

12

billion, is fixed.

13

That is the claim in the bankruptcy.

They are

14

our largest creditor, and they will be satisfied in a plan

15

of reorganization with however much they get out that

16

process of negotiation and reorganization.

17

The only way they get to manipulate it is if

this Court reverses and the restoration is effective and

What if it was a mandatory

Does the restoration provision not apply to

any mandatory termination situation?
MR. KADEN:

13

No.

The — the -- in our view, you

have to be able to afford a plan in order to take it back.

Because if you don't -- if you can't afford a plan, when

16

you take it back, it will be immediately terminated

Because once you do, if you restore a plan

QUESTION:

I bet you don't agree, Mr. Kaden,

3

that the agency's reasons were independent rather than

cumulative?

I think they've made clear that —

that the reasons are independent.

that's legally valid.

Okay.
Their position is that abuse by

itself justifies restoration, and for the reasons I've

indicated, we disagree with that.

Our final point is the process point.

The

20

question of what procedures apply in informal adjudication

21

is, as the Solicitor General indicates, an important one

22

not yet addressed by this Court.

opportunity to rebut, is -- is fundamental.

law that was passed, which took -- which was passed three

there's no basis for that assumption here.

QUESTION:

Does one of the plans now have no

assets in it?
MS. FLOWE:

14

That is incorrect, Justice O'Connor.

15

As I mentioned in my earlier dialogue with Justice

16

Kennedy, because the agency uses this proportional

17

funding, we've been paying some of the benefits out of our

18

premium funds under that plan.

That does mean that there will be a -- an amount

payable back to the agency once restoration is upheld.

But the plan does have money.
