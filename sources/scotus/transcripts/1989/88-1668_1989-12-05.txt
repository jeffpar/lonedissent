ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD C. REDCAY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. REDCAY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Ninth Circuit decision in this case creates

12

a new private antitrust cause of action

on behalf of

13

competitors, the least-favored class ofantitrust

14

plaintiff to challenge price cutting, which is the essence

15

of competition, and without requiring the competitor to

16

prove that below prices pose any credible threat of injury

17

to the consumer interests that are the primary concern of

18

the antitrust laws.

19

Specifically, the Ninth Circuit decision permits

20

a competitor to recover profits and sales lost as a result

21

of increased competition from low prices imposed on its

22

rivals by vertical maximum price fixing.

23

The error in the Ninth Circuit's decision is

24

that it permits an antitrust recovery simply because a

25

plaintiff's injury is causally linked to an antitrust

violation without requiring a determination whether the

2

injury reflects the reasons why the Defendant's conduct

3

violates the antitrust laws or whether allowing such a

4

recovery would be inimical to the purposes of the

5

antitrust laws.

6

As was also true of the competitor claims in

7

Brunswick and in Cargill, the antitrust recovery sought

8

here would be inimical to the purposes of those laws.

9

Now the procedural history and the facts are

10

rather straightforward and are, in all material respects,

11

undisputed.

1982 marketing program designed to appeal to price­

13

conscious consumers.

convert its marketing strategy from one of higher prices

15

for more service and credit to lower prices with less

16

service and hopefully larger volumes.

17

emulated a marketing strategy that theretofore had been

18

employed mostly by the independent refiners.

19

USA filed this lawsuit to challenge ARCO's

At that time, ARCO decided to

ARCO, in effect,

ARCO also at that time engaged in many measures

20

to cut the costs of refining and distributing gasoline,

21

allowing it to lower its wholesale and retail prices.

22

resulting lower prices both at ARCO-owned and operated

23

stations and at independently owned and operated ARCO

24

brand stations were tremendously successful in attracting

25

new customers, and the market share of ARCO brand gasoline

The

1

increased from approximately 12 percent to around 15 to 16

2

percent in a little over a year.

3

increased competition that led USA to file this lawsuit.

4

As I said, it was this

USA's complaint alleges a broad brush attack on

5

ARCO's marketing program.

6

changes in marketing techniques had actually caused it to

7

enter an entirely distinct market, the discount gasoline

8

market, of which USA said ARCO already had a 45 percent

9

market share.

10

USA in fact alleged that ARCO's

USA then alleged that ARCO was attempting to

11

monopolize this market through predatory pricing in

12

violation of Sherman Act Section 2.

13

Now USA also alleged Sherman Act Section 1 price

14

fixing because much of the gasoline of ARCO that was sold

15

in competition with USA was sold not by ARCO directly but,

16

rather, by ARCO independently-owned ARCO dealers who

17

competed with USA.

18

ARCO responsible for the low prices of these ARCO dealers

19

because, otherwise, USA's injury was too remote to confer

20

standing in USA to challenge the allegedly predatory ARCO

21

prices.

USA needed Section 1 in order to hold

22

USA, therefore, alleged that ARCO had coerced

23

its dealers to pass along these price cuts to consumers

24

through threatened revocation of discounts, reductions of

25

supply and termination of franchises.

After ARCO moved for summary judgment on both

1
2

Sherman Act counts, USA abandoned its discount market

3

allegations and its predatory pricing case.

4

its Section 2 claim, and it eschewed any intention of

5

proving predatory pricing in support of its Section 1

6

claim.

7

It dismissed

And USA made abundantly clear in opposing the

8

summary judgment motion at issue here that it was not

9

going to prove predatory pricing but, rather, that all it

10

needed to prove was that ARCO had engaged in vertical

11

maximum price fixing in violation of Section 1 and that

12

price fixing was the cause, in fact, of USA's injury.

13

Now this contention, which is — which is set

14

out most clearly in USA's Statement of Genuine Issues in

15

Opposition to ARCO's Summary Judgment Motion, framed the

16

antitrust injury issue that the district court decided

17

adverse to USA and which the Ninth Circuit then decided in

18

USA's favor.

19

QUESTION:

Well, as it -- as the case comes to

20

us, is it conceded or clear that USA was injured and was

21

injured by the agreement on maximum pricea?

22

MR. REDCAY:

What is clear as it comes to Your

23

Honors is that there — there was vertical maximum price

24

fixing assumed here and that USA was injured as a result

25

of the low pricing that resulted from the vertical maximum

price fixing.

What is not —

QUESTION:

MR. REDCAY:

4

QUESTION:

5

What is not —
— that — that is — well, then,

maximum price fixing by agreement.

6

MR. REDCAY:

7

QUESTION:

8

Well --

It — by coercive agreement.
Well, the — the nonowned stations,

there was an agreement, wasn't there?
MR. REDCAY:

9

What is alleged in the complaint is

10

that ARCO used coercion to cause those dealers to succumb

11

to that coercion and charge prices lower than the dealers

12

otherwise would have charged but for their — but for the

13

coercion and their succumbing to the coercion, which in

14

fact is —

15

QUESTION:

Well, that's — that's tantamount to

16

an -- I mean it should be treated the same as an

17

agreement?

18

MR. REDCAY:

Under -- under -- it is an

19

agreement — it is a combination conspiracy in violation

20

of Section 1.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. REDCAY:

23

Yes.
Yes.

All right, then.
This is a — this is a case

like Brunswick and Cargill and other antitrust cases —

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. REDCAY:

So there was a Section 1 violation?
For purposes of deciding this

1

issue, there was an assumption of a Section 1 violation.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. REDCAY:

Yes.
The problem is with the contention

4

and that theory with these two facts undisputed doesn't

5

pass muster under either of the two standards set forth in

6

Brunswick for determining antitrust injury, each of which

7

serves an important antitrust policy of avoiding

8

overdeterrence by making sure that the treble — the scope

9

of the treble damage remedy that is — that is imposed on

10

any particular violation be related to the fact — that

11

which makes the conduct unlawful.

12

USA's claim fails at the threshold level because

13

its lost profits and sales are not the type of injury that

14

the rule against vertical maximum price fixing was

15

intended to prevent.
QUESTION:

16
17

Mr. Redcay, how -- how do you think

the Albrecht decision bears on this question?

18

MR. REDCAY:

I think Albrecht obviously is the

19

Court's — Court's articulation that — that a coercive

20

vertical maximum price-fixing agreement is, per se,

21

illegal.

22

particular antitrust injury issue that is presented here.

23

Albrecht does not deal with or address the

I think that the way Albrecht bears on the issue

24

is to make it perfectly clear that this Court most

25

recently reaffirmed in Sharp that vertical maximum price

1

fixing involved an agreement to force the dealer to adhere

2

to a specific price.
QUESTION:

3

Well, it seems to me if you have to

4

look for a — an antitrust injury, as you claim, that you

5

are somehow altering the per se rule under Albrecht,

6

whether you say so or not.

7

MR. REDCAY:

Justice O'Connor, I don't believe

8

so.

I believe that Albrecht, which of course did involve

9

a claim by a coerced dealer, or there it was a coerced

10

distributor of newspapers, is perfectly consistent with

11

our position.

12

Our view is that because it is the coercion that

13

makes vertical maximum price fixing unlawful, that is the,

14

to use the words of Brunswick, that is the vat.

15

coercion is the vat which makes the conduct unlawful, and

16

as a result of that the coerced dealer, such as the

17

plaintiff in Albrecht, certainly satisfies the threshold

18

Brunswick standard, and the coerced dealer is a proper

19

private plaintiff to bring this kind of a cause of action,

20

and that — we take no issue with either the per se rule

21

or the antitrust injury of the coerced dealer.

The

QUESTION:

So you wouldn't be here, I take it,

if the dealer was suing?
MR. REDCAY:

That's -- if the dealer was suing,

what we would have to do is defend the case -9

QUESTION:

1
2

You'd have to get Albrecht overruled

or some — and some others.
MR. REDCAY:

3

We would — we would -- what we

4

would do, Your Honor, is to prove that -- that ARCO didn't

5

engage in coercive price fixing.

6

summary judgment because the wrong plaintiff is here.

7

But we're here on a

USA, in effect, if I can -- if I can make it

8

this way, USA is attempting to usurp a rule that this

9

Court has created to protect the coerced dealer's pricing

10

discretion and is trying to apply it to a wholly different

11

injury that's never been identified in any of this Court's

12

opinion as a reason for imposing illegality.
Another way of looking at it is that USA is

13
14

taking a square peg, its claim as a competitor of a

15

coerced dealer, and is trying to put it into a round hole,

16

the — that rule against vertical maximum price fixing.
Now Brunswick is intended to prevent just that

17
18

kind of a squeeze, allowing only the round hole, the

19

coerced dealer's claim, like the plaintiff in Albrecht,

20

into the round hole in order not to divorce the private

21

antitrust remedy from the purposes of the Sherman Act.

QUESTION:
Albrecht.

Mr. Redcay, reference is made to

MR. REDCAY:

If I were — if I were sitting —

QUESTION:

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. REDCAY:

5

opinions in Albrecht,

6

persuasive Justice Harlan's dissent, and I do believe that

7

in light of GTE v. Sylvania and Matsushita and Cargill and

8

more recent decisions of the Court,

9

question of Albrecht were squarely presented, that I think

Justice White won't mind.

Go ahead.

I find more — when I read the
I will say that I find more

I think that if the

10

that Albrecht should be overruled and that the vertical

11

maximum price fixing should turn on the rule of reason and

12

not a per se rule.

13
14

But I — I have the comfort of not being here
arguing that particular issue today.
QUESTION:

15
16

MR. REDCAY:

21

Well, the interesting thing is

that —
QUESTION:

19

20

I was on the Eighth Circuit

when Albrecht was reversed, but I didn't sit on the panel.

17
18

You see,

(Inaudible)

if we don't overrule

Albrecht?
MR. REDCAY:

Certainly.

In fact,

it is my

22

position that the issue of whether or not vertical maximum

23

price fixing is to be judged under a per se rule or a rule

24

of reason is irrelevant to the antitrust injury issue

25

that's presented here.

(800) FOR DEPO

Under a per se rule, the anti — the

1
2

procompetitive effects of price ceilings that result from

3

vertical maximum price fixing are ignored for purposes of

4

determining illegality because those procompetitive

5

effects are presumably by law ignored — they're

6

outweighed by the anticompetitive effects on the coerced

7

dealer.

8

Under a rule of reason, the procompetitive

9

effects must be balanced against the anticompetitive

10

effects to determine if the conduct is unreasonable and,

11

therefore, illegal.

12

What is important for antitrust injury purposes,

13

however, is that under either of those scenarios, the

14

effects on competitors of the coerced dealers are

15

procompetitive by definition; and, therefore, it really

16

doesn't matter to me whether you apply a rule of reason or

17

a per se rule.

18

QUESTION:

If ARCO could have predicted that

19

consequence, and that apparently is the consequence that

20

occurred, does that mean that it was entitled as a matter,

21

say, of business judgment and legal ethics to enter into

22

the agreements that it did?

23
24
25

MR. REDCAY:

Well, what is alleged here

is -- is —

1
2

agreement.
MR. REDCAY:

Right.

Assuming there is a price­

3

fixing agreement, then obviously ARCO has violated the

4

law, and ARCO is subject to all the — all the sanctions

5

that are available, criminal sanctions as well as civil

6

sanctions by the class of plaintiffs against — for whom

7

the rule is designed to protect.

14

QUESTION:

And I assume their attorneys could

not participate in — ethically in drawing the agreements?
MR. REDCAY:

That -- that's correct.

But what

is involved here isn't drawing agreements.
QUESTION:

Well, let's — let's assume they were

in agreement.
MR. REDCAY:

Correct.

And the problem I — the

15

problem in arguing any standing or antitrust injury issue

16

is that one assumes the violation.

17

that any violation occurred, but — but what you need for

18

purposes of standing or antitrust injury or these

19

doctrines that are designed to identify who may properly

20

bring a claim, you need some issue that will be available

21

to summary adjudication and to quick determination.

22

And so —

23

QUESTION:

We obviously dispute

But as I understand the law, sitting

24

in the corporate board room, ARCO should not have engaged

25

in this conduct if, in fact, it constituted an agreement

1

to fix maximum -- maximum prices.

2

MR. REDCAY:

Correct.

But what is

3

involved — the problem we have here is a case where the

4

evidence is highly ambiguous.
What ARCO wanted to do, as I indicated in my

5
6

statement of facts, was it wanted to lower its gasoline

7

prices.

8

because it distributes through independent dealers, it had

9

— it was in a situation where it had to come up with a

It wanted to become more competitive.

And

10

situation to get those prices down to dealers.

11

lowered — it lowered the wholesale price, but that's

12

about all it could do, and then it tried to persuade, as

13

the courts have made very clear that ARCO can engage in

14

exposition, persuasion and argument to get its dealers to

15

lower the prices.

16

And so it

And we believe that's all ARCO did, that's all

17

ARCO's people were counseled to do.

18

have to try if we ever have to try it is whether that

19

exposition, persuasion and argument went over the line and

20

went into coercion.

21

event we certainly don't believe that, as I said, the

22

square peg should be allowed to recover because,

23

otherwise, ARCO would be responsible in treble damages not

24

only to all the dealers they allegedly coerced but to USA,

25

to Shell, to Mobil, to Chevron.

The question we will

We don't believe it did, but in any

broad exposure which rules like Brunswick are designed to

2

prevent.

3

QUESTION:

4

suggests, if ARCO had just said would you like to be a

5

dealer; yeah; well, here, sign up, and here's an agreement

6

that expressly says don't sell for any higher price.

7

There were express price-fixing agreements, you — then

8

you would be arguing the same thing, I suppose?

9

v.

(Inaudible) if, as Justice Kennedy

MR. REDCAY:

That -- that the dealer would have

10

the ability to challenge that but not a competitor of the

dealer.

Yes, Your Honor.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Redcay —

13

QUESTION:

But — but there's a lot of things

14
15

you can do alone but not by agreement.
MR. REDCAY:

That — and that's correct, and

/
16

that -- that is the reason for making those illegal, but

17

it is not a reason for allowing any particular plaintiff

18

who might be able to say that he was injured as a cause in

19

fact of that to be able to recover treble damages, which

20

is a very potent remedy.

QUESTION:

Mr. Redcay, it seems to me you

22

may — you may be understating the effect of our agreeing

with your argument.

coerced dealers would — would have a cause of action.

You say that coercion of the dealers is the evil at which

1

the antitrust law is directed.

2

that's true at all.

3

It doesn't seem to me

You're — you're relying on the language of —

4

of Brunswick that says that loss must be the type that the

5

antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows

6

from that which makes the defendant's acts unlawful.

7

It seems to me that if minimum price fixing —

8

or maximum price fixing is unlawful, the loss it's

9

intended to prevent is — is obtaining control of the

10

market and therefore being -- thereafter being able to

11

raise the prices.

12

addressed against the coercion of retailers.

13

retailers are coerced?

14

I'm not sure that the antitrust law is

MR. REDCAY:

Who cares if

The — the only reason that I care

15

and I take the position is because Albrecht is on the

16

books, and I think as long as Albrecht is on the books

17

that would be a more difficult case.

18

was — I'm not arguing to overrule Albrecht.

19

QUESTION:

And I was -- I

I — I think the logic of your theory

20

might have to lead us to say that there is no cause of

21

action on the part of anybody except a consumer who is

22

ultimately harmed by the market monopolization that this

23

maximum price fixing produces.

24

MR. REDCAY:

25

There's -- there are two different

articulations in Brunswick.

One is the -- if whether or

not the conduct is that which the law is intended to

prevent; and the other is whether or not consumer welfare

3

is injured.

4

I think in — in your case, Justice Scalia,

5

your — if both of them are required, then you're right.

6

MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Prior to 1982, USA Petroleum was quite content

with conditions in the gasoline market.

complaint, the major oil companies did not compete on the

19

basis of price but, instead, advertised heavily and

The campaign was

Now the crux of USA's complaint is that ARCO

8

lowered its prices by forcing the ARCO dealers to do so;

9

but so far as the antitrust laws are concerned, any

10

coercion of ARCO dealers by ARCO is none of USA's

11

business.

The dealers can stand up and sue ARCO.

QUESTION:

1

But that may be so, but do you think

2

there is antitrust injury in the sense the term is used in

3

Brunswick and other cases if the suit had been brought by

4

a dealer?

Would there be antitrust injury?
MR. ROBERTS:

5

Yes, I do, Your Honor, because the

6

antitrust injury inquiry looks to whether the injury flows

7

from the reason the particular restraint is unlawful.

8

reason the restraint is unlawful is because it limits the

9

freedom of the dealers, because it may prevent some of

The

10

them from surviving, because it may prevent some of them

11

from offering additional services to consumers.
All those were the reasons identified in

12

13

Albrecht.

That's the reason this is illegal.

14

suffers those injuries can bring suit, and that's the

15

coerced dealers.
QUESTION:

16

The one who

In reality, though, it seems to me

17

that's the definition of a — of the violation, not a

definition — not a description of the injury.

fixing is prescribing a minimum price.

That's the violation.

MR. ROBERTS:

It seems to me that in this case the

evil or the violation is coercing the dealers, and the

1

evil is how that disrupts the market.

2

MR. ROBERTS:

Maybe it would be better if you

3

looked at the price by itself and the antitrust violation.

4

The violation, the reason this is illegal, is the

5

coercion.

6

There's nothing wrong with the price that ARCO

7

dealers were — at which they were selling their gasoline.

8

The case comes to this Court on the assumption that no

9

predatory pricing is involved.

The price is a lawful

10

price, and USA's complaint is that they're forced to

11

compete against that lawful price.

12

QUESTION:

You could say the same thing about an

13

agreement.

You could say there's nothing wrong with

14

everybody charging a price.

15

not the harm that it causes to anybody but the agreement

16

in a — in a run of the mine Sherman Act violation.

17

The agreement is what makes that invalid.

The evil is the agreement,

18

Coercion is what makes this invalid.

19

agreement nor coercion is the evil against which the law

20

is directed, it seems to me.

21

MR. ROBERTS:

But neither

I think that's precisely correct,

22

and that's why in an agreement case, horizontal conspiracy

to fix prices, we don't look to what level the price is.

brought by co-conspirators.

7

beneficiaries of the antitrust laws, as this Court made

8

clear in the Reiter case, they always have -- suffer

9

antitrust injury.

The

And consumers, the ultimate

And, in fact, as a theoretical matter I think

10
11

consumers could sue in this case, although it would be

12

hard to establish damages, consumers who, for example,

13

preferred credit cards and additional services.

14

But it is the dealers who have in the past

15

brought vertical maximum price fixing cases to this Court.

16

That was true in Kiefer-Stewart.

17

For that matter, it's true in the other vertical restraint

18

cases such as Monsanto and Sharp.

It was true in Albrecht.

In contrast, the Ninth Circuit majority below

19
20

did not, and USA cannot, point to a single case in which

21

the Court has allowed a competitor of the coerced dealer

22

to bring suit complaining about the coercion his rival

23

faces.

MR. ROBERTS:

1

We have argued in the past, Your

2

Honor, to this Court that these types of agreements should

3

be evaluated under a rule of reason in particular cases

4

and not a per se rule, but we do not submit that Albrecht

5

should be reconsidered in this case.

6

particularly inappropriate vehicle for such

7

reconsideration because the Court has to reach the

8

antitrust injury requirement whether the violation is per

9

se illegal or illegal under a rule of reason.

It — it is a

10

And that's why we think the per se label makes

11

absolutely no difference whether the violation is per se

12

illegal or illegal under a rule of reason.
And that's why we think the per se label makes

14

absolutely no difference to a resolution of the antitrust

The per se label goes to the substantive
The antitrust injury

24

there is no sound policy reason for making an exception to

The approach of the majority below, we think,

7

would render the antitrust injury requirement superfluous.

8

It would, for example, lead to a different result in cases

9

this Court has already decided.

For example, in Cargill

the allegation was that a merger violated the antitrust

laws and that the merged entity would be able to lower

The Court nonetheless held there was no

19

approach, as Judge Alarcon noted in dissent, really

reduces simply to a cause in fact test.

made clear in Brunswick, there's more to the antitrust

injury requirement than that.

Now if those

result of illegal coercion of the ARCO dealers, those

So it's irrelevant to you that these maximum prices were

set by agreement, either vertically or horizontally?
MR. ROBERTS:

21

I think that's right, Your Honor.

22

The antitrust injury requirement does apply in horizontal

23

cases.

24

Both Brunswick and Cargill were horizontal cases.

makes this easier, is that it's difficult to find the

May I ask you this?

What if

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

11

Thank you, Mr. Roberts.

MR. BLECHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Court has been presented with four distinct

12

analytical approaches to resolving this question of

13

antitrust injury, and before I deal with those four

14

analytical approaches I'd like briefly to place the

15

litigation in its proper context, which I don't believe

16

Mr. Redcay, in fairness, has done.

17

What's alleged in the complaint and what's

18

assumed to be the factual predicate for the appeal process

19

through the Ninth Circuit and here is that ARCO organized

20

and enforced a vertical price-fixing combination with its

21

dealers to eliminate the independent segment of the

22

gasoline selling market by setting a price either below

23

the market level or below some standard, of course, which

24

was not set out with specificity in the complaint.

what they were charged with.

Now, ARCO —

2

QUESTION:

3

But you ultimately withdrew your

claim of predatory pricing, did you not?
MR. BLECHER:

4

I withdrew, Mr. Chief Justice, my

5

claim of Section 2 under the Sherman Act.

It is

6

absolutely incorrect, and I invite the Court's attention

7

respectfully to the transcript of the argument before

8

District Judge Gray in October of 1986 where we told him

9

it wasn't necessary to reach the question of predation

10

because if they applied this Court's decision in

11

Matsushita it was only necessary in a Section 1 case that

12

we show the level of price to be below the prevailing

13

market price.

14

But there's no place where we ever withdrew the

15

claim of predatory price which is alleged in the

16

complaint, as distinct from the entire requisite elements

17

of monopolization.

18

QUESTION:

Let me call your attention to page

19

25a of the Petition for Writ of Certiorari which -- and

20

which is the beginning of part IV of the Ninth Circuit's

21

opinion.

22

asked to determine whether a retail competitor suffers

23

antitrust injury in the form of lost profits as a result

24

of a nonpredatory maximum vertical price-fixing

agreement."

In light of those facts, he concluded that we

could not establish the requisite antitrust injury.

That's what he found, and that's what the Ninth Circuit,

as a shorthand expression in my view, was talking about

That's totally illogical because

if the antitrust laws have the solicitude, as this Court

has frequently said, it should be for interbrand

competition.

13

Here is a case in which resell price maintenance

has been used as a vehicle to distort interbrand

competition, and --

QUESTION:

What sort of resale price -- you

17

think resale price maintenance is minimum fixing as well

18

as maximum fixing?

MR. BLECHER:

I believe it is, Your Honors.

I

20

read -- Sharp made no distinction when it talked about

21

vertical resale price maintenance.

22

it, Dr. Miles on the one hand, which has traditionally

23

been treated as a minimum case, with Albrecht on the other

24

and made no distinction and said both facilitate

25

cartelization and both remain, per se, illegal.

It equated, as I read

So I

1

don't — I don't recognize -- I don't think it's necessary

2

to recognize a distinction.

\
But my point is ARCO's argument would require us

3
4

to prove under a guise after you find an antitrust

5

violation that is, per se, illegal.

6

says to prove antitrust injury you now have to prove a

7

dangerous probability monopolization, thereby engrafting

8

the requirements of Section 2 into a simple Section 1

case.

10

ARCO comes along and

I don't see how you can possibly square that

with Cargill or preserve the integrity of the treble

Excuse me, the third approach.

5

Excuse me.

The government has offered a third approach,

6

and that third approach is that we don't need — they

7

don't endorse ARCO's position that we need to prove the

8

elements of monopolization.

repeat the reason we voluntarily withdrew the monopoly

And, of course, I want to

claims, because of the recognition that we could not prove

11

the dangerous probability of monopolization in any

12

properly defined relevant market.

Now that comes back to become, in ARCO's view

14

and in Judge Gray's view, the basis for dismissal of the

MR. BLECHER:

The U.S. position is that we don't

have to prove the full — panoply of facts necessary to

21

show a Section 2 violation.

I believe the Court —

QUESTION:

Mr. Blecher, once again, I don't

8

think it's fair to say that they — they assert that that

kind of price fixing is good.

They -- I think their

argument would assert that it is still bad, or at least

until we overrule prior case law.
However, it is not the kind of badness that your

12

13

client can complain about, other people can complaint

14

about

MR. BLECHER:

I believe my answer to that is

16

that if any — if the Court has solicited about the true

17

interbrand effect of price fixing, the distortion of

QUESTION:

Aren't low prices generally thought

MR. BLECHER:

Yes, but not if they're arrived at

6

We're not against low prices, Mr. Chief Justice.

7

QUESTION:

Well, no, but — but you — you're

8

claiming damages because you lost sales from somebody who

9

was selling lower than you were.

MR. BLECHER:

That's true, but by agreement, not

11

by the marketplace.

12

happened in the marketplace, and let me give you just some

13

illustrations of what ARCO could do.

14

lower the price to its dealers, the wholesale price and

It's another case if the policy

I think, Justice Stevens, they

appreciated that when they set up the factual predicate at

10

the beginning of the decision and at 859 F.2d 696 the

11

majority says, "USA complains that it has suffered

12

financial losses and is being driven out of the market by

ARCO's illegal price fixing.

that the antitrust laws were meant to prevent."

15

QUESTION:

This is the type of injury
Yes.

It's quite different to say they're

as a result of a program specifically intended to drive

MR. BLECHER:

And you think that when the district

Yes.

I think what the district

7

court said unequivocally in a very short statement was

8

that if we could not prove the requisite elements of

9

monopolization we couldn't show antitrust standing because

10

the Ninth Circuit accepted the argument that the agreement

11

to fix low prices was procompetitive and, therefore, the

12

only way it crosses the line and becomes anticompetitive

13

is when there's a threat of monopolization.
And what that does is it sets up a totally

separate analytical approach to antitrust injury.

In a nutshell, that's the way it was alleged and

6

Ninth Circuit says, well, if that's what you're alleging

7

and they took the price under the market, you don't need

8

to show it's predatory because that complies with the

9

first leg of this Court's statement in footnote 8 in

10

Matsushita which says that if there's a conspiracy to

drive people out of business by charging a price below the

has made by a rule of reason analysis; and we certainly

have to get affirmed, because all that would say is

instead of having a presumption of illegality

MR. BLECHER:

Of course, there would still be a

combination, and the only difference then is we'd have to

prove what the actual marketplace effect was, and

10

then — and if the elimination of the competitors is

11

effect, we could win.

I must respectfully suggest that

MR. BLECHER:

The alleged and accepted facts for

10

this purpose is that we lost sales and profits as a

11

consequence and closed stations as a consequence of our

12

inability to charge a price as low as ARCO was charging.

13

ARCO was charging at retail less than what it costs us —

You mean you didn't go down from 6

percent to 2 percent?
MR. BLECHER:

It's very substantial, and the

company was forced to constrict itself during this period.

23

And the record is clear, and the undisputed fact are that

-- that literally dozens of independent marketers and

and many others shifted their operations from independent

2

to the ARCO flag.

3

So the effect of this in the marketplace, at

4

least in California, was very substantial, which is why I

5

believe, Justice Scalia, we can show anticompetitive

6

effect wholly apart from the elements of monopolization.

7

This has had a very significant effect on the

marketplace, and what I want to suggest to you is if in

any way you condone this, in any way you say this cannot

10

be reached by people directly in the — the target of and

11

within the impact zone, I think you can reasonably expect

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. REDCAY:

I would like to begin with the case that Mr.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

10

Blecher says is controlling, and that's Matsushita.

11

Matsushita was a horizontal price-fixing case in violation

12

of Sherman Act Section 1, but the plaintiffs in that case

13

did not even -- and obviously the plaintiffs were injured

14
15

as a result of the alleged horizontal price fixing.
But the plaintiffs there didn't contend that

16

they could -- they could recover simply by showing a price

17

fixing agreement and cause, in fact, injury.

18

recognized that they needed to prove a horizontal

19

conspiracy to engage in predatory pricing, and this Court

20

wrote a landmark opinion addressing when you can have

21

predatory pricing and when you cannot because all parties,

22

including the Court, recognized that only such a

23

conspiracy could cause the plaintiffs there cognizable

24

injury.

reaffirmed in Cargill was that — that the only time you

2

can have an antitrust recovery is where the competitors'

3

and consumers' interests are coincident, and those

4

interests are only coincident when the low prices pose the

kind of danger of obtaining the power that can ultimately

lead to higher prices.

So I think that Matsushita also is a controlling
case, and I think it supports our position.
