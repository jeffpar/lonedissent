ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. FROHNMAYER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MI^. FROHNMAYER:

10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case is before this Court a second time.

11

The

12

first question was whether claimants were entitled to

13

receive unemployment compensation benefits after being

14

fired as drug counselors.

15

violated their employer's job-related rule that they be

16

drug free because they ingested peyote in the ceremonies

17

of the Native American Church.

It is undisputed that they

A majority of this Court held that the claimants

18
19

were not entitled to unemployment benefits under the

20

doctrine of Sherbert v. Verner if their conduct, even if

21

religiously motivated, violated a valid Oregon criminal

22

law.

23

on federal grounds on remand, the question is this.

24

the Free Exercise Clause require every state to exempt the

25

religious peyote use by the Native American Church, or

perhaps even beyond that, other substance use by other

2

religions, from the reach of generally applicable criminal

3

laws regulating the use of controlled substances by all

citizens?

QUESTION:

General Frohnmayer, the Oregon Supreme

6

Court really didn't tell us whether the Oregon

7

constitution would have been violated by this statute, did

8

it?

9

the Oregon constitution.

10

We still don't know what the position would be under

MR. FROHNMAYER:

In footnote 3 of the Oregon

11

Supreme Court's decision on remand, Justice O'Connor, the

12

court reserved the question of what would happen in a

13

fact-specific criminal prosecution related to the conduct

14

of a specific person arrested and prosecuted.

15

QUESTION:

Has — does -- do we know whether there

16

have ever been any criminal prosecutions in Oregon under

17

the statute of members of the Native American Church for

18

peyote use?

19

MR. FROHNMAYER:

Yes, we do.

More than a decade

20

ago, in a case called State v. Soto, which I believe is

21

described in our briefs, the conviction of a person who

22

was a Native American for peyote use was upheld, criminal

23

prosecution, and certiorari was denied by this Court.

24

That is a dozen years ago.

25

QUESTION:

Was there any claim in that case that

existence of their religion is threatened if they are not

11

free to use this substance.

12

QUESTION:

Is it also true that the federal

13

government and some 23 states exempt peyote use from their

14

drug enforcement schemes?

15

MR. FROHNMAYER:

There is an exemption in the Drug

16

Enforcement Administration's regulations for bonafide use

17

by the Native American Church.

18

O'Connor, we believe, is wholly inaccurate.

19

our reply brief is a careful parsing of the states that

20

provide, either by legislative exemption or judicial

21

decision, an exemption for religious peyote use, sometimes

22

by a named religion, other times more generically

23

referring to bonafide religions.

count is closer to 12 or 13.

exemption in the 12 states you are talking about applies

2

only to use by a member of the Native American Church?

3

MR. FROHNMAYER:

Justice Scalia, no, the exemptions

4

are somewhat scattered in terms of how they are phrased.

5

For example, in Arizona it is simply a defense through a

6

prosecution rather than an exemption from Schedule I, and

7

it refers to bonafide use of peyote.

QUESTION:

MR. FROHNMAYER:

(Inaudible.)

MR. FROHNMAYER:

I am sorry, Justice White.

By whom?
By the bonafide practice of a

religious belief.

QUESTION:

14

MR. FROHNMAYER:

Any religious belief?
That is right.

Others -- in fact,

exemptions single out the Native American Church, so --

MR. FROHNMAYER:

The federal exemption is limited

to the Native American Church.

to the Native American Church.
MR. FROHNMAYER:

That is one of the deeply-

3

troubling aspects we find in the Oregon Supreme Court's

4

decision, because there is another church, an offshoot of

5

this church, called the Peyote Way Church of God, which

6

also has many Native American members and which has

7

strictly controlled religious rights which a lower federal

8

court has denied the same exemption enjoyed by the Native

9

American Church.

10

QUESTION:

Am I correct in thinking that one need

11

not be a Native American to be admitted to the Native

12

American Church, or to participate in its rituals?

13

MR. FROHNMAYER:

Justice Rehnquist, I — I would be

14

somewhat hesitant to answer that question, because that is

15

more properly directed, I believe, to the communicants of

16

the church.

MR. FROHNMAYER:

Mr. Black was not a Native

American.

We believe it is a fair reading of the record

24

that he believed that he was a member of the Native

25

American Church.

it is evident by universal and pervasive regulation.

QUESTION^:

Is there any documentation in the record

17

or in reported opinions of the danger-that peyote is

18

diverted from religious use and, say, sold on the street

19

in the normal drug distribution channels?

20

MR. FROHNMAYER:

Justice Kennedy, we know that it

21

is found in normal drug distribution channels, although

22

not in great amounts.

QUESTION:

Is it used for the derivative mescaline,

24

which in turn is used commercially?

25

mescaline from some other source?

MR. FROHNMAYER:

1

Mescaline, as we understand it,

2

can be produced synthetically, as well as, of course,

3

being found as the psychoactive ingredient in peyote

4

itself.

5

from mescaline is the presence of alkaloids in a natural

way in the peyote button, which does create additional

7

effects on the particular user.

QUESTION:

Does this record show the presence of

peyote buttons in the normal drug trade in any significant
amounts?
MR. FROHNMAYER:

The best evidence for that is in

12

material at least tangential to the record and in other

13

lower court proceedings, which shows that the DEA has

14

seized some 19 pounds, I believe, is the figure, over

15

perhaps the period of a decade.

So that shows at least --

The

QUESTION:

How long do these things last?

7

MR. FROHNMAYER:

It is said, Justice Blackmun, and

8

I am now trying to recall from memory precisely, that the

9

effect may last as long as 12 hours.

To quote from the

10

record in Smith's case Exhibit 8 from a clinical substance

agent which does sometimes have long-lasting negative

effects on its user, with no predictability as to when

14

that can happen.

It is "very risky."

The record is consistent with what is known

These dangers are great enough that Oregon

In the face of these considerations, the Oregon

6

Supreme Court has concluded, however, that the federal

7

Constitution commands a judicially crafted exemption for

8

sincere adult users of a single church.

9

for us a dilemma.

And this poses

On the one hand, if the exemption is

10

crafted so narrowly that it applies to one group on a de

11

minimis basis, then that means that our state and federal

12

constitutions have preferred one religion over another,

13

and hopelessly compromised the constitution requirements

14

of neutrality.

QUESTION:

20
21

I am sorry, Justice?

Can we say the same thing about the

result of the — Wisconsin against Yoder?
MR. FROHNMAYER:

No, we think not.

Because there,

22

in Yoder, the church was not singled out by name and by

23

identity and by denomination, and there were no others

24

similarly situated who were clamoring for that particular

25

exemption.

obviously, on many other important grounds, and I can

2

reach them now.
QUESTION:

3

Well, suppose the Wisconsin legislature

4

had singled out the Amish church.

5

singles that out it is all right, but the legislature

6

can't?

7

MR. FROHNMAYER:

Just because this Court

We think the problem is compounded

8

when a legislature singles it out, because the judicial

9

exemption is free of broader interpretation, whereas, if

10

the legislature in its plenary judgment has singled out a

11

specific church, we believe it has, in many respects,

12

potentially run afoul of the Establishment Clause unless

13

it treats other religions clamoring for equal treatment on

14

similar grounds in similar ways.

15

QUESTION:’ Are you arguing that the 23 — or it

16

isn't 23 under your figures, but whatever the number of

17

states is that grant exemptions, those exemptions all

18

violate the Establishment Clause?

19

MR. FROHNMAYER:

No, we are not.

We did not come

20

to this Court to argue that giving an exemption in some

21

form or another is an impermissible state act in the

22

exercise of its plenary authority.

There is a problem in just allowing

Isn't that a problem, too?
Justice Scalia, that is one of the

12

major reasons we have brought this case to this Court for

13

a second time, which is, we are asked, we believe, not

14

merely to see this as one case, but it is in fact the thin

15

end of the wedge in which analytical distinctions are

extremely difficult to draw, and in which claims certainly

will be made, as they have been made in lower courts with

increasing frequency, for other drugs and other —

Well, but the state certainly could

prohibit the use — the consumption of alcohol within its

Yes, but what I am asking is supposing a

state did not give that statutory exemption.
MR. FROHNMAYER:

There, an argument for

accommodation is stronger, stronger in at least two

16

respects.

17

this Court examines or re-examines the nature of the

18

compelling state interest and the potential danger of the

MR. FROHNMAYER:

Again, bearing in mind the

admonition that it is not government's role to explore the

would fairly reveal that a hallucinogenic dose of four is

common, and that ingestion of between eight and 30 of the

peyote buttons is common.

decide state constitutional issues before federal, and

Justice Lindy has written on this, why didn't they do that

MR. FROHNMAYER:

Either because they did not

believe it was dispositive of this Court's question to it

conclude from the decision in Smith I in the Oregon

MR. DORSAY:

QUESTION:

Yes, it is.
I mean, we granted certiorari on the

8

question presented, which is whether the Free Exercise

Clause of the First Amendment protects a person's

religiously-motivated use of peyote from the reach of the

11

state's general criminal law prohibition.

you agree that the First Amendment issue is here.

But once that is shown, the state must show, as Justice

2

O'Connor summarized in the Goldman case, that the interest

3

will in fact be substantially harmed by granting the type

of exemption requested, and that the state interest will

be undermined by granting the exemption, and there is no

And it is our belief that the state cannot meet any
of the burdens in this case.

The compelling state

interest is the regulation of drug abuse generally, but we

do not have any evidence in this case that peyote has been

abused or that it contributes to the drug abuse problem.

In fact, all of the evidence is to the contrary.

Is peyote habit forming?
No.

It has not been shown to be habit

forming or addictive in any respect.
I wanted to briefly address the other Establishment

upholding the Native American Church is that it's a

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. FROHNMAYER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Two points on Oregon law.

The case of State v.

10

Soto which is relevant to my answer to Justice O'Connor's

11

decision, the court did not address the Oregon

12

constitution, and that was probably prior to a time at

13

which state and federal constitutional claims were

14

separately considered.

15

With respect to the question propounded by -- to

16

opposing counsel, the question of benefits and the

17

entitlement of Respondents to benefits under the state law

18

and under the state constitution was fully settled by the

19

Oregon Supreme Court before this Court ever reached this

20

case in Smith v. — Smith I.

21

entitlement to benefits, putting aside the criminal law

22

issue, is settled law, it is, as the Chief Justice said,

23

water over the dam in terms of what the state law ruling

24

was on misconduct and whether that is covered by -- or

25

protected, by the state constitution.

So the state constitutional

It is not.

QUESTION:

The reason the benefits are required in

MR. FROHNMAYER:

That's — and we believe that a

different answer would have been forthcoming on remand,

because we believe that it is relevant and it is a

distinguishing factor.

Third is a factual point, Mr. Chief Justice, and

that is that it is generally agreed that the ingestion of

very adverse precedent decided by the Oregon Supreme Court
