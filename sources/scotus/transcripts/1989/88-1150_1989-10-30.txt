Mr. Farr?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTON FARR, III

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. FARR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May it

please the Court:
The issues in this case are important ones regarding

10
11

the nature and extent of federal judicial power.

The Eighth

12

Circuit has held that a federal court, in seeking to remedy a

13

constitutional violation, can give higher authority for state

14

taxes than state law allows, and it further has held that the

15

district court properly exercised that authority in this case.

16

We think that the court of appeals was wrong pn both

17

counts.

18

government to tax its citizens without its consent, and it

19

certainly can't do so without showing that no other remedy and

20

no other means of financing is available.

21

In our view, a federal court can't authorize a

Now, before turning to the merits, I'd like to spend

22

a few minutes on the issue of jurisdiction in this Court.

23

basic issue seems to us pretty straightforward:

24

of appeals treat our rehearing petition, which sought en banc

25

review, as a petition for rehearing as well as one for en

The

did the court

1
2

banc?
If it did, and several circuits have made an express

3

practice of treating petitions this way, then it seems clear

4

to us that under the rules the time for seeking review in this

5

Court was tolled until after the petition was denied.

6

Now, the Eighth Circuit has said itself how it

7

treated this particular petition.

8

nunc pro tunc it said that it had denied petitions for

9

rehearing with suggestions for rehearing en banc, and it

10
11

In an order that it entered

corrected its earlier order to reflect that fact.
QUESTION:

Mr. Farr, we occasionally run into a

12

situation here where a court of appeals or a state court will

13

enter a judgment nunc pro tunc where the Petitioner has had

14

his time for certiorari expire just so that the person will be

15

able to petition in what they think is a timely manner.

16

would be somewhat disturbing, I think, if there were any

17

thought that the court of appeals had just kind of given a

18

break to your client.

19

MR. FARR:

This

Well, Your Honor, I don't think there's

20

any reason to treat the order in that particular way for a

21

couple of reasons.

22

First of all, there's certainly nothing on the face

23

of the order or anything that it suggests that it is simply

24

doing that as an accommodation to the parties.

25

Secondly, it is in fact the regular practice of the

Eighth Circuit to treat petitions for rehearing en banc as

petitions for rehearing with suggestions for rehearing en

4
5

QUESTION:

A regular practice?

6

MR. FARR:

I'm sorry?

7

QUESTION:

A regular practice?

8

MR. FARR:

That is what we understand from the

9

clerk's office, that this is a practice that was instituted

10

well before the petition was filed in this case and that the

11

court of appeals does follow, and it is — our understanding

12

is the only reason it was not followed in this case was simply

13

a matter of inadvertence in the clerk's office.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

So there are no instances in which that

was not done?
MR. FARR:

Your Honor, I can't certainly say that I

17

know of no instances in which it was not done.

18

is that I do understand that from a period of time beginning,

19

I believe, sometime in 1987, that the court has been following

20

this practice as a general matter and they have —

21
22

23
24
25

QUESTION:

All I can say

The Eighth Circuit has no rule to that

effect, does it?
MR. FARR:

It does not have an express rule to that

effect, no.
QUESTION:

Was there anything in the petition for

1

rehearing en banc that indicated that it was intended to serve

2

both purposes?
MR. FARR:

3

No, Your Honor, there was not.

Now, I

4

would say, though, I don't think that in any sense the court

5

of appeals are or should be limited by what is specifically

6

asked for in the petition.

7

As I say, in these other circuits which do have it

8

as an express matter of rule, there is no requirement that, in

9

order for the rule to come into play, you actually have to

10

have said, I would like rehearing from the panel, in the

11

process of applying for rehearing at all.

12

decided as a matter of internal court business that that would

13

be the more flexible way to deal with these, in fact, I think

14

to eliminate some of the confusion that has arisen out of

15

problems like this one.

16

They simply have

QUESTION:

The petition — it used the word

18

MR. FARR:

I'm sorry?

19

QUESTION:

It used the word rehearing, at least.

20

MR. FARR:

Our particular petition did, yes.

21

QUESTION:

It didn't say just a suggestion.

22

MR. FARR:

That's correct.

23

QUESTION:

It said rehearing.

24

MR. FARR:

It used the word rehearing specifically,

17

25

rehearing.

that's correct.

QUESTION:

Mr. Farr, did you say our clerk's office

treats this as a permissible practice?

3

MR. FARR:

Just when — I'm sorry if I wasn't clear.

4

It's the Eighth Circuit's clerk's office that I was talking

5

about.

6

QUESTION:

Oh, I see.

7

MR. FARR:

What they have informed us, just once

8

again, is that when a petition is filed, even if it is

9

entitled Petition for Rehearing en Banc, it has become the

10

regular practice of the Eighth Circuit to treat that as a

11

petition for rehearing with a suggestion for en banc.

12

what the court did, therefore, in its order — its amended

13

order — was simply to --

14
15

QUESTION:

MR. FARR:

20

Well, if a petition for rehearing is

filed, that does toll the time under this Court's rules.

18
19

But didn't you say they treat it as

tolling the time when you're —

16
17

And

QUESTION:

If it's a petition for rehearing by the

MR. FARR:

Well, in fact, the court's rules state a

panel.

21

petition for rehearing.

They don't specifically specify the

22

panel, but I think that is at least --

23

QUESTION:

But that's what it means.

24

MR. FARR:

That is my understanding of what it means

1

QUESTION:

And the practice of this Court, I assume,

2

is to treat both a suggestion for rehearing, or a petition for

3

rehearing en banc, as not tolling the time?

4

MR. FARR:

Your Honor, my understanding is that the

5

practice in this Court is that if the court of appeals issues

6

an order and says, we have essentially treated this only as a

7

suggestion for a rehearing en banc, this Court has not taken

8

that to toll the time.

9

But again, I would like to go back and say that is

10

not what the Eighth Circuit has done here.

11

has said, we have treated this as a petition for rehearing

12

with a suggestion for rehearing.

13

QUESTION:

The Eighth Circuit

Well, but that was by a nunc pro tunc

14

order which perhaps it didn't have any authority to enter.

15

mean, if there wasn't any jurisdiction they can't come in

16

later and create it by that kind of an order.

17

MR. FARR:

I

Your Honor, I don't know of anything that

18

would prevent a court of appeals, certainly before this Court

19

has ruled on a petition, from saying we have made a mistake in

20

the form of our order, or the order should have read

21

differently from the particular order that was entered and we

22

would like to correct that order and to reflect it.

23

seems to me fully within the power of the court of appeals.

24
25

QUESTION:

That

Yes, but when it comes here, we have to

determine whether the petition to us was timely or not.

MR. FARR:

1

Well, that's correct, Your Honor.

2

There's no question, this Court has to determine whether to

3

give effect to the order of the Eighth Circuit or not.

4

not saying that — that that is not an issue before the Court.

5

I'm

What I am saying, though, is that there is no good

6

reason not to give effect to the order of the Eighth Circuit,

7

because it is reflecting its practice, and what the Eighth

8

Circuit says, at least in its order, was in fact what it did

9

in this case, and I don't think there's any reason to second-

10

guess the Eighth Circuit on that.
One other point I would make, at least as some

11
12

independent evidence to suggest that the Eighth Circuit is not

13

engaging in some sort of device or sham, here, is what

14

happened with the mandate.

15

Under the rules of — the federal Appellate

16

Procedure Rule 35, the mandate would not automatically be

17

stayed simply by a petition or suggestion for rehearing en

18

banc.

19

was automatically stayed.

20

But there's no question, in this case, that the mandate

There is no order staying that, but the mandate did

21

not issue until after the petition was denied, so we think

22

that what the court's order says is consistent with, in fact,

23

the way the court showed it treated the petition at the time

24

the petition was filed.

25

Now, turning to the merits, as I have said, the case

1

involves questions first about whether federal courts can ever

2

give authority for higher state taxes and, second, whether

3

they could do so here.

4

some common issues about just what judicial power is and how

5

it ought to be exercised.

6

And these questions involve, I think,

I begin with what I think are two relatively

7

uncontroversial propositions.

8

courts do have broad remedial powers to correct for

9

constitutional violations.

First of all, that the federal

10

The second point, however, is that that power is

11

subject to limitation, in particular, limitations that are

12

drawn from the Constitution itself.

13

be of different kinds.

And these limitations can

14

For example, they can be absolute limitations, ones

15

that completely bar the use of judicial power in a particular

16

circumstance, or they can be more flexible.

17

limitations that allow the courts to exercise power but

18

require the courts to take account of other important

19

institutional interests.

20

They can be

Now, for example, in the first category I think a

21

federal court simply could not tell a senator or a congressman

22

to refrain from activities which are protected under the

23

speech and debate clause, and in fact the Court so held in

24

Eastland v. U.S.S.F in 421 U.S.

25

court could tell the President that it had to appoint a

Nor do we think a federal

particular Cabinet official.

2

applies, can be an absolute barrier to relief.

3

Sovereign immunity, where it

But then there are other doctrines which fall under

4

the second category, doctrines like comity and judicial

5

restraint, which — which do require the courts to give weight

6

to other branches of government or, in the case of comity, to

7

state and local governments.

8

9

It's simply not correct, therefore, as a starting
point for this discussion, to say that a federal court can

»

10

always bring about a particular result, or should always bring

11

about a particular result in a case before it, and indeed, the

12

particular case cited by the Eighth Circuit for the idea that

13

courts generally must have the power to carry out their

14

particular orders is Marbury v. Madison, a case in which this

15

Court held that it did not have the power under Article 3 to

16

give the relief that the litigants sought.

17

Now, what has happened in this particular case is

18

that the courts below have ventured into new ground.

19

believe for the first time ever, a federal court has

20

authorized a government to assess and levy taxes that its

21

citizens haven't authorized.

22

We

There seem to be some very good reasons, and I will

23

discuss them, why this power may be absolutely beyond the

24

reach of the federal courts.

1

we're dealing with an — an authorization by a court to a

2

local body to levy a tax, rather than -- rather than the court

3

itself purporting to, itself to tax?

4

MR. FARR:

Your Honor, I have stated it that way

5

because first of all I don't think it makes any difference

6

which of the two it is.

7

just to save quibbling over it, I think what in fact happened

8

is that the district court ordered the school district to levy

9

the tax».

I think they're both improper, but

The Eighth Circuit then essentially said well, we

10

will authorize, we will change this slightly so that we will

11

authorize the school district to levy the tax.

12

question, however, that if the school district said, now that

13

we've been authorized to levy the tax, we've decided not to

14

levy it, that an order would be forthcoming, at least under

15

the way the courts below have treated it to date.

that the authorization is in fact one that is backed up by the

order.

MR. FARR:

1

It will.

What the parties by agreement,

2

Your Honor, said for this particular tax year, we would not go

3

through that particular process because the case was pending

4

in this Court, but there's certainly no question, I think,

5

that the district court intends to follow that.
QUESTION:

6

And what alternative did the court below

7

have?

How was it going to achieve what it had determined had

8

to be achieved in the absence of the money?
MR. FARR:

9

Well, Your Honor, I think the question is

10

— if I understand it — how would it achieve it in the

11

absence of the tax?

12

there.

13

as I will say, we don't think that's the correct thing to do,

14

but if you simply isolate the funding, then we think the court

15

should have addressed the question of whether it would have

16

been less intrusive, as we believe it is, to simply put all of

17

the funding responsibility on the defendants jointly.

18

Now, I think there are two questions

First of all, if you simply isolate the funding, and

We think, although, that obviously does have an

19

effect on the state, that that is a less intrusive use of

20

judicial power.

21
22

23

QUESTION:

Well, are they -- are the state and the

school district jointly and severally liable here?
MR. FARR:

There is some dispute about that in the

24

lower court, but some of the orders clearly read that way,

25

Your Honor, yes, they do.

QUESTION:

1

Well, let's assume they are jointly and

2

severally liable, what could the court have done, just order

3

the state to pay it all?

4

MR. FARR:

Your Honor, we think that would have been

5

a less intrusive form of financing if the question came to

6

that.

7

that is not the only alternative that the court —

Now, I want to make clear, our position here is that

8

QUESTION:

But it is one alternative?

9

MR. FARR:

That is one alternative, that's correct.

10

We believe there is another alternative, however; the court,

11

if it was going to increase the burden of the state, should

12

have examined whether it was possible to reach the

13

constitutional goal by means that didn't put such an enormous

14

burden.
But — so I think both of those should be

considered.

possibility of saying that the state, as the sovereign body,

would be responsible for seeing that the financing was

obtained.

QUESTION:

Well, what — what is there in the record

21

that indicates the court did not consider those less intrusive

22

alternatives?

Well, Your Honor, we believe that there

24

is simply -- the record will stand on its own, that there is

25

no adequate discussion by the court of looking at and

rejecting the various alternatives that we are talking about.

2

I mean —

3

QUESTION:

Now, when you're talking about

4

alternatives, are you talking about alternatives to the

5

substantive provision of — provisions of his order, or just

6

funding?

7

MR. FARR:

What we are -- essentially, what we are

8

talking about is both, Your Honor.

9

they can be taken, one from the other, at least in our view of

10
11

Because I don't think that

how the court ought to exercise power.
What we think should happen is that a court, in --

12

in putting together remedies, must be aware, from the

13

beginning, of the particular financing concerns that are being

14

caused by the remedy.

15

the history here, from the very first order, remedial order,

16

in June of 1985, the court indicated that the school district

17

was going to have difficulty raising really any significant

18

funding to contribute to the remedy.

19

And if you look just very briefly at

The very next year, however, the court, with only

20

the very briefest conclusory discussion of cost, adopted, at

21

the urging of the school district itself, an experimental

22

remedial program, which went well beyond any remedial program

23

ever ordered in a school desegregation case.

24

QUESTION:

[Inaudible] --

So your position is that before this —

the district court can either order a tax or order the state

to pay for funding, it must make a finding on the record that

9

there are no remedies or alternatives other than the ones that

10

it is adopting that are sufficient to meet the remedial

11

objectives that the court has decreed?

12

MR. FARR:

That's correct, Your Honor.

We think

13

that is the process.

14

there's a specific result that we're asking for here.

15

Obviously, that is something that the court would be required

16

to determine itself.

17

that that is something that, in exercising equitable powers,

18

and — and let me stress again, I'm assuming at the moment

19

we're -- that there is an — a power to tax somewhere at the

20

end of this, but before exercising any equitable powers that

21

put these unusual burdens on, the court should engage in just

22

that sort of analysis, and make proper findings.

23

And --

QUESTION:

But you're saying it now.

12

MR. FARR:

What we are saying is that we believe

9
10

13

that is an alternative that is preferable to ordering the tax.

14

And that in terms of looking at how judicial power is

15

exercised, that that would be less intrusive than the order to

tax, even assuming that the power to tax exists at all.

to determine whether all of the funds are needed.

is the full exercise of equitable power that we are asking the

court to examine.

That that

We are not even here suggesting that the proper

result is simply to say, let's ignore whether these costs are

7

absolutely necessary or ignore the burdens they may put on a

8

particular defendant, just let's shift the money around.

That's not our position in this court, and that was not our

If we just confine

MR. FARR:

-- it's only against the best interests

of the client if two assumptions are made.

exercise of power as to how it properly should be determined -

MR. FARR:

Well, Your Honor, let me say — and I'll

2

come back to it, that I — that I think that what I'm talking

3

about is fairly encompassed within the question the court did

4

grant, but the other assumption, of course, that has to be

5

made is that the only interest of the state is the financial

6

one.

7

here both of the sort of sovereignty of the state and its

8

state laws, and essentially the commission that the state has

9

from its people.

10

And I think that's not true.

That there is a question

And I think that is the thing that is so troubling

11

about an order that involves the power to tax is that, in this

12

particular case, what it says to the state is — or says to

13

the school district -- you have authority now from the court

14

itself to levy a tax that the citizens have not given you

15

authority to levy — in fact, it specifically denied you the

16

authority to levy.

17

And the idea of taxation without representation,

18

which is of course a catchy slogan, but I think it's something

19

more than that, too.

20

power to take property from citizens — the government's power

21

to take that property is — is exercised through elected

22

representatives and not through courts, unless there is

23

individual adjudications, which of course we don't have here.

24
25

I think it's rooted in the idea that the

So, the — that is the principle that the state does
believe is one that is -- is worth preserving and that its

laws simply shouldn't be set aside because the court feels

2

that that would be a more convenient way of achieving its

3

goal.

4

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Farr, your argument makes it

5

sound like what you're saying is there's no power to tax

6

because it's too expensive — this program is too expensive.

7

MR. FARR:

Your Honor, the — the —

8

QUESTION:

Is that what you're urging?

9

MR. FARR:

Well, I've — I've jumped around, and let

10

me make clear that there are two different points that I'm

11

urging.

12

That federal courts simply don't have the power to say to a

13

legislative body or a school district, whatever, the people

14

have not given you this authority, but I, as a federal judge -

15

- [inaudible] —

The first is that there is no power to tax, period.

22

23

necessary.

will work and be effective without a tax.

’

1

the logical point that one gets to any time one puts any

2

limits on judicial power.

3

One can always look at a — the particular exercise

4

of power and say, if there weren't limits on these powers, we

5

could quash the subpoena that the House subcommittee has

6

issued, for example, which may infringe somebody's rights.

7

That is — so that is why you only obviously limit judicial

8

power when the institutional considerations are of extreme

9

importance.

10

But we think they are of extreme importance in

this particular case.

11

So that's the first point that we are making, that

12

that power simply does not exist in federal courts, even, as

13

you posit, in the most extreme case.

14

The second question, though, the second point we are

15

putting, is that as an exercise of power, of equity and

16

comity, that this is not the extreme case.

17

the extreme case the other way, that the court essentially put

18

itself into this whole and then said, having gotten into it,

19

that there were only two ways to extricate itself, the tax and

20

perhaps levying it all on the state.

21

that that process should be looked at once the hole is dug.

22

Now I would say one — one more word about power.

If anything, it's

And we don't believe

23

have made the point, I think, that the power, in and of

24

itself, is an extraordinary power, but I think it can't just

25

be viewed in isolation.

I think the other thing that this

claim of power does is it concentrates, in the federal court,

2

a range of powers that are really quite extraordinary,

3

beginning with the power to declare what the Constitution

4

means — the power, of course, that everybody concedes -- to

5

the power to issue orders for particular programs, orders that

6

require state and local officials or federal officials, in

7

some cases, to comply and implement those programs, and

8

ultimately, now, the ability of the courts to try to go out

9

and get the citizens to support these programs beyond the

10

power that they have already given to their elected

11

representatives.

12

*

That is a concentration, I believe, that is well

13

beyond the idea of judicial power that is embodied in article

14

three, which anticipated that courts obviously would have

15

important power, but that power would be distributed, not just

16

among the courts themselves, but among and -- and between

17

other branches of government.

responsibility to ensure the implementation and the funding of

1

petitions for writ of certiorari had run before any petition

2

was filed and, thus, that there was a jurisdictional bar from

3

this Court considering the case.

4

The state now relies basically on the nunc pro tunc order

5

that was issued just a very few days after this

6

clerk's -- this Court's clerk's determination, where the

7

Eighth Circuit declared that it had denied petitions for

8

rehearing and petitions for rehearing en banc.

9

This Court, in the Credit Company v. Arkansas Central

Railway case, stated clearly that jurisdiction in this Court

11

cannot be created by an order of a lower court or by a nunc

13

that the state did not file a petition for rehearing below.

14

QUESTION:

The fact is, the very plain fact is

May I ask right there, supposing at the time

the Eighth Circuit initially denied the petition for rehearing

of the rule says that the timely filing of a petition for

If the state had filed a timely petition for rehearing

3

regardless of how it was characterized, we would concede that

4

the time -- the time would be tolled even -- even regardless

5

of the phrasing of the Eighth Circuit's rule.

it takes before the Eighth Circuit to file a petition for

MR. SNYDER:
QUESTION:

Justice Scalia —
Could the Eighth Circuit if it

11

wished — indeed, haven't some other circuits done so

12

explicitly, said that when you file a petition for rehearing

13

en banc, it shall be deemed to be a petition for rehearing

14

with suggestion for rehearing en banc?

15

MR. SNYDER:

Justice Scalia, we agree that a circuit

16

court can do that and is certainly free to treat the petitions

17

in any way it wishes.

18

First of all, I think there is a serious question whether

19

in that way it can extend this Court's jurisdiction when the

rule of this Court talks in terms of whether the parties have

filed a timely petition for rehearing.

QUESTION:

You know, I — I'm prepared to do that where -

- where there is a lot of evidence to that effect, but —

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. SNYDER:

Justice Scalia, I do not suggest t-hat ;

6

however, I do suggest that, first of all, the failure of the

7

mandate to issue does not, in our view, indicate that the

8

court was treating this as a petition for rehearing.

9

we cited the United States v. Samuels case as an example of a

10

case where the Eighth Circuit has held up a mandate because a

11

judge was considering en banc treatment.

12
13
14

In fact,

And so the circuit courts have the power to hold the
mandate whether or not a rehearing petition has been filed.
QUESTION:

Would the circuit court have had the authority

during the pendency of this petition to amend the panel

opinion?

it appropriate or — or prudent to amend their opinion?

the issue is whether a petition for rehearing was filed; and

petition for rehearing by the panel.

And I think that the state has in essence

Now the question of whether the Eighth Circuit has a

10

pattern and a practice and a regular custom of so treating it

11

that might have lulled a party into filing something different

or thinking as if there were a local rule that this would be

13

treated differently, the state in its main brief cited as its

14

principal support for the proposition that the Eighth Circuit

has a regular practice the McDonnell Douglas case and said

that that and other cases suggest this is how the Eighth

decisions that we found, and most of these rulings on en banc

First is that the McDonnell Douglas case on which

surprised now to hear that the practice is allegedly more

recent.

But more fundamentally, we do not believe that this

12

There is nothing in the Eighth Circuit's rules or its internal

MR. SNYDER:

I believe it would not be sufficient, Mr.

2

Chief Justice, particularly because this Court I think is not

3

in a good position to engage in evidentiary hearings or

4

proceedings to try to determine what the practices might be.

5

The best evidence of such a practice if a circuit court

6

wishes to adopt it is to put it in the rules, which would

7

allow the parties to know when their time was running and when

8

it wasn't; and not only the parties filing the petition but,

9

hopefully, the parties who might be opposing the petition

10
11

would like to know when the case is final.
Now turning, if I may, to the — the merits of the

12

argument here, the state's position comes down basically to

13

the bald suggestion that in at least some cases the federal

14

courts simply lack the power to ensure that

15

constitutionally-required remedies are implemented and funded.

16

We believe that that position is without any precedent in this

17

Court's jurisprudence and is dangerously wrong,

2

I think since Marbury v. Madison, it's been understood

3

that the federal courts, once they accept jurisdiction of a

case and have the power to hear the case and find a violation

of the Constitution, have the power and have the duty to use

6

their equitable discretion to find and to be sure that it is

is stronger in the context of the kind of violation we have

here, but I agree under the Supremacy Clause there should be a

We would acknowledge that in exercising the lower court's

discretion and power, they should look to questions and issues

of comity and of federalism and equitable principles.

agree that those should be considered in fashioning the

MR. SNYDER:

But it seems to me it's another

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I do not

believe this court's cases limit the statutes that can be

10

stricken where they interfere with the implementation of a

11

remedy to those that are an independent constitutional

12

violation, and I would cite, for example, Washington versus

13

Fishing Vessel Association which we cited in our brief, where

14

perfectly neutral state law provisions had the effect in that

15

case of preventing the implementation of the remedy the court

16

had already ordered was the right remedy.

state laws, if they have the practical effect of stopping

implementation of a constitutionally required remedy, can be

overridden.

In this case, the state in the district court said

that the one issue it cared the most about with regard to the

or any other basis for the state to pay part of the costs that

2

otherwise the district would have to bear.

3

The district court, exercising his discretion in

4

looking at principles of comity, saw that both governmental

defendants, in essence, were agreed in saying that an order

that allowed the school district to pay its share of the

remedy allowed the citizens of the district to contribute when

8

it had been found guilty of a constitutional violation as

before such a remedy can be adopted, the district court must

9

everything that went into those remedial determinations, and

10

we have not briefed that issue, but I do believe that the

11

record shows that the constitutional violations here were

12

particularly pernicious and, in fact, resulted in the Kansas

13

City school district becoming a 74 percent minority district

14

because of the actions of the state and at an earlier stage

It would not, I submit, be feasible or practicable

QUESTION:
MR. SNYDER:

10

All right.

.

However, we think it is feasible to do

11

what the court below did, which is to demand that these

12

schools be brought up to the level comparable to other schools

13

in the area so as to attract back in the students who left

14

when the facilities were, "literally rotting" as was found

15

below.

16

There were holes in the roofs.

The buildings were

17

rotting down, and water was pouring in, because the local and

18

state authorities had stopped funding the schools.

proceeding to accept the remedy which was found to be

necessary, following the right precedents —

QUESTION:

Even if that presents an abstract

question divorced from the concrete realities of this case?
MR. SNYDER:

Well, I think this court frequently

8

will consider abstract or legal questions and will leave the

9

factual determinations to the lower courts.

I assume, perhaps

10

presumptuously, but I assume when this court denied cert on

11

question one, it felt that there was not a legal question

12

worthy of review on question one, but felt that the issue

13

raised by question two raised a legal question for review.

think they can be separated.

15

In conclusion, we really come back to the

16

proposition with which we started, and that is that violations

17

of constitutional rights we believe require the federal courts

18

to use their discretion looking at principles of comity and

19

federalism, looking at the practical circumstances of —

Well, Mr. Snyder, do you see any

difference between — on — legally between what the district

the future?

MR. SNYDER:

A small difference, Justice White.

Well, what I mean to say is, I think

I think technically it is before you,

believe that there's any violation.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MR. H. BARTON FARR, III

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

13

MR. FARR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Just a

couple of brief points.
Returning momentarily to the jurisdictional

14

question, the Respondents take the position I think, as I

15

understand it now, that what this Court ought to do is review

16

the particular papers that were filed in the Court of Appeals,

17

rather than taking the Court of Appeal's order at face value.

18

We don't think that is in fact a rule that is likely

19

to lead to a great deal of certainty and we think that the

20

Court of Appeals is entitled to treat the papers before it as

21

a rehearing petition if it wishes to do so.

22

pointed out several times, several circuits do.

As we have

23

The difference between a case like this and --

Where you want certainty is ex ante.

You want the person who

files this petition to know whether the consideration of it is

2

going to toll his time to appeal and to tell him that he's

3

only going to know that when the Court comes out with its

4

decision that says well, we've treated this as this, or we've

5

treated it as the other, that doesn't help, does it?
MR. FARR:

6

But Justice Scalia, there's no such

7

absolute certainty in any event.

8

agrees, I believe that the Court can treat it as a petition

9

for rehearing if it wants.

I mean, because everybody

It could grant it as a petition

10

for rehearing, it could modify its opinion, all sorts of

11

things could go on, and I think to allow the Courts that sort

12

of flexibility as part of their own operating procedures

13

simply makes sense even though there might be some less

14

certainty on the front end as to what the particular litigant

15

expects.

16

The difference between this and the Credit Company

17

case I think is that a Court of Appeals can and should have

18

the power to do that.

19

can't treat June 15th as if it were June 1st.

20

something that's wholly outside the ambit of the power of a

21

Court of Appeals and therefore that purely — that effort to

22

convey jurisdiction by taking an action like that is literally

23

outside its power.

despite what it is saying right now, has at various times

throughout the litigation said that the school district should

bear none of the cost.

5

are opposed to that.

6

The school district,

We have said we as a general principle

We think the school district should bear some of the

7

cost, and we think that the Court should devise remedies that

8

allows both of those principles to be carried out, where the

9

state would bear a burden, the school district would bear a

10

burden, and constitutional compliance would be achieved with

11

both of them doing that.

12

The problem, as we have said, is that the Court

13

simply ignored those considerations in developing the

14

particular remedy and essentially made the kind of order that

15

it led to, or the alternative of the state bearing all of it,

16

a foregone conclusion.

Finally, I'd just like to say — sorry?
