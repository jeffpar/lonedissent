ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. PALMER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. PALMER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This is a statutory habeas corpus case brought

11
12

by a Texas state prisoner.

13

whether the ex post facto clause was violated when the

14

state appellate court applied a statute that allowed it to

15

reform the judgment to delete an unauthorized punishment.

16

The question presented is

In 1981 Carroll Youngblood abducted and sexually

17

assaulted a young woman.

18

his plea of not guilty, and was found guilty of the

19

offense of aggravated sexual assault by a jury.

20

Thereafter, a separate punishment hearing was held before

21

the same jury, in which the state proved that Youngblood

22

had previously been convicted of a felony.

23

assessed punishment of life imprisonment and a $10,000

24

fine.

25

He was tried the next year upon

The jury

Following affirmance of his conviction,

1

Youngblood filed a state habeas application in which he

2

complained that the fine that the jury assessed was not

3

authorized by state law.

4

appeals agreed and granted relief.

5

Article 37.10(b) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure,

the court of_ criminal appeals reformed the judgment to

delete the fine.

to the life sentence handed down by his jury.

The Texas court of criminal

conduct.

There is no question but what Youngblood was on

18

notice at the time he engaged in his actions that they

19

could lead to the incarceration he presently is suffering.

20

21

of Calder v. Bull, nor can he show that he was deprived of

22

fair warning of the possible consequences of his actions.

QUESTION:

But do you argue that this claim is

barred by Teague v. Lane?

that issue, and we have not chosen to rely on it.

2

Court chooses to address that without reaching the ex post

barred.

QUESTION:

If the

Do you understand Teague to be a

jurisdictional rule or is it something you can waive?
MR. PALMER:

I understand it to be

8

jurisdictional, Your Honor.

Certainly if it is not, well,

9

then I would think we had waived it in this case.

But

10

given the conflicting opinions of the courts through which

11

this case has travelled, both state and Federal,

12

particularly the two concurring opinions in the court of

13

appeals below, I don't think there is any question but

14

what this would be a new rule under Teague and under

15

Butler v. McKellar.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Palmer, you know, in the opinion,

17

even in Calder against Bull, and you find in a couple

18

other of our opinions, they do lay down — like Beazell,

19

for example — they do lay down these three general

20

principles that you have adverted to.

21

kind of language indicating that something else might come

22

along too, don't you think?

23

MR. PALMER:

But then there is

Well, there are decisions of this

24

Court that contain language to the effect that changes

25

which are procedural in nature may violate the clause if

1

they affect substantial personal rights.

I would suggest

2

to the Court that in every case in which the Court has

3

found a violation due to a procedural change, it has fit

4

within the Calder framework with two exceptions.

5

think those two exceptions are readily distinguishable.

And I

The first of those is Thompson v. Utah,

involving the right to a 12-person jury under the

8

Constitution.

territory and the defendant was entitled to the Federal

At the time of the offense, Utah was a

10

right to trial by jury.

11

was of the opinion that that right embraced the right to a

12

12-person jury.

13

become a state and had passed a statute limiting the jury

14

to eight persons.

15

decision in Thompson was the notion that the change in law

16

had deprived the defendant of a right he possessed under

17

the Federal Constitution.

18
19

At that time, in 1898, the Court

By the time the case was tried Utah had

QUESTION:

In addition to that —

Although clearly the right to jury

trial did not apply to the states at that time.

20

MR. PALMER:

That's what I am saying, Your

21

Honor.

22

Utah was not a state, and he possessed that right as a

23

citizen of a territory.

25

At the time the defendant committed the offense

QUESTION:

So a change in jury size meets the ex

post facto test?

MR. PALMER:

1

Well, in the sense that the jury

2

size question in that case was thought to be inherent in

3

the constitutional right to trial by jury.

4

The second case, I think, which does not fit

5

perhaps neatly within the Calder framework would be Kring

v. Missouri.

7

pleaded guilty to a less included offense.

8

provided that that plea of guilty represented an acquittal

9

of the greater offense, which would have been a capital

That was a case in which the defendant

I think — there are two things that can be said

11
12

about Kring.

13

good law in light of later decisions of this Court

14

regarding the effect of a guilty plea and withdrawal of

15

that plea.

16

the effect of the change in law was such that the

17

defendant was subjected to a death sentence, which was not

18

in effect at the time of the offense, not in effect if he

19

had pled guilty to the lesser.

20

represents a change in law that deprived the defendant of

21

an absolute defense to punishment.

But regardless of whether it does, in Kring

So in that sense Kring

In this case that is not so.

Youngblood was

23

sentenced to life imprisonment.

The result he seeks is a

24

reversal and the right to a new trial, in which he again

25

could be sentenced to a term of life imprisonment.

QUESTION:

1
2

What was the absolute defense that

the defendant was deprived of in Kring, did you say?
MR. PALMER:

3

Well, Your Honor, the Court itself

4

has not interpreted Kring consistently since that time.

5

Later cases, later decisions of this Court contain

6

language to the effect that Kring represents a case in

7

which the defendant was deprived of the right not to be

8

sentenced to death.
But if the Court will look at the decision in

9
10

Kring itself, at page 450, the Court says flat out this is

11

not a case in which the defendant was deprived of the

12

defense.

13

the rules of evidence were altered so that the prior plea

14

of guilty and acquittal of the greater had no force in the

15

second trial.

16

The Kring court characterized it as one in which

QUESTION:

That reasoning really doesn't hold up

17

under the later cases, the reasoning that the Kring court

18

used, does it?

19

MR. PALMER:

I think it is quite questionable,

20

Your Honor.

21

is readily distinguishable.

22

And even if it did, I think Youngblood's case

QUESTION:

Would you explain why the right of

23

the defendant to a reversal of his conviction or having it

24

set aside and to get a new trial is not a substantial

25

personal right under the former Texas law?

MR. PALMER:

1

Well, Your Honor, to the extent

2

that this so-called right existed under Texas law, I

3

suggest the Court should defer to the Texas court's

4

interpretation of that law.

5

37.10(b), the Texas courts had consistently held that in

6

cases of jury verdict error, they were powerless to

fashion any remedy other than an entire new trial.

a right of the defendant —

right of the defendant to get a new trial?

substantial right, it was no right at all.

MR. PALMER:

QUESTION:

4
5

He could, Your Honor, but -Based on the lack of power of the

state court to remedy it.
MR. PALMER:

That is true, Your Honor.

My

6

response is twofold.

One, to the extent this Court —

7

that this question turns on Texas law, I think Texas law

8

is clear that this was not seen as a right but rather as

9

one of a lack of authority.

10

However, even if the Court characterizes it as a

11

right, or disagrees with the Texas court's interpretation,

12

it is far from clear that prior Texas law necessarily was

13

advantageous to defendants in these type of cases.

14

In Youngblood's case, for instance, the

15

permissible range of punishment was a term of imprisonment

16

for 15 years to life.

17

sentence at the lower end of that range, and had he

18

obtained a new trial, which is the result he is seeking in

19

this case, he would have exposed himself to a life

20

sentence on retrial, a greater punishment than was -- than

21

had been handed down at the first trial.

22

QUESTION:

If Youngblood had received a

Well, the, under the old law the

conviction would just be set aside.

exposed to punishment at all.

would be reversed and the state would be free to retry him

2

again and seek whatever punishment was permissible, up to

3

and including life.

4

QUESTION:

5

I know, but he has been convicted and

illegally sentenced.

Is that right?

MR. PALMER:

QUESTION:

He —
And the appellate court says this is

an illegal sentence, and his conviction is hereby set

aside.

10

MR. PALMER:

QUESTION:

That is correct.
And you get a new trial.

And until

12

there is another conviction, you are not exposed to

13

punishment at all.

14

pretty close to even Calder.

No, Your Honor.

25

the term of imprisonment would stand.

procedural changes normally do not offend the clause.
Youngblood has characterized this case as one in

The

court of appeals likewise characterized the case.

would suggest that that approach is flawed because it

QUESTION:

4

MR. PALMER:

Exactly, exactly.
We would suggest to the Court that,

5

as the Federal government has, the case that is most

analogous to this is Mallett v. North Carolina.

case the Court upheld the retrospective application of a

8

statute which provided the government the right of appeal

9

that it did not possess at the time of the defendant's

11

In that

trial.
Here, as in Mallett, the statute in question

12

simply provided the government with authority which it did

13

not possess before.

14

of such authority should not be construed as the

15

equivalent of a personal right.

16

Youngblood had no more right to have his case disposed of

17

in a particular way than Mallett did to avoid a successful

18

appeal by the government.

19

and Youngblood has not suggested that it is not, it

20

controls the disposition of this case.

The retrospective application of Article 37.10(b)

has disadvantaged the respondent by depriving him of the

have one's guilt retried by a different jury, with its

attendant possibility that the outcome might be different

But it seems to me what has happened here is

12

that the state's appellate procedure was changed before

13

your client underwent that appellate procedure.

14

the state has not said retroactively that it is okay to

15

impose both sentences, both the fine and the imprisonment.

16

It still said you are right, that was invalid before; it

17

is still invalid.

18

between your client's wrongful conviction and the appeal.

19

All the state said is we are going to have a new

procedure, which your client had not yet undergone.

If the court said -- if the court of criminal

you had a right not to have that procedure exist, which

was taken away when, after the wrongful conviction the

right in seeing that there was no procedure for the state

never had that before, and it is a benefit to the

be that the basic notion in our form of government that a

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Farrar.

Mr. Palmer, do you have rebuttal?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. PALMER

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

MR. PALMER:

Very briefly, Your Honor.

6

Youngblood has relied to some extent on the

7

language in Ex parte Spaulding to the effect that prior to

8

the passage of the statute an unauthorized jury verdict

9

was a nullity and voided in its inception.

That language

10

must be examined in light of what the court of criminal

11

appeals subsequently said in Ex parte Johnson.

12

as you have just been told, was the first case to come

13

before the court after the statute was enacted.

14

got his judgment reformed to have the fine deleted, as did

15

Youngblood.

16

Johnson,

Johnson

The court of criminal appeals discussed prior

17

Texas law under which it had no reformation authority, and

18

then went on to say, and I quote, in this sense a judgment

19

and sentence were considered void since there was no way

20

to cure the infirmity.

21

however, the legislature has enacted a new law that

22

enlarges the authority of courts to reform judgments, thus

23

providing a way to cure the infirmity.

24

such verdicts were void under Texas law, they were void

25

for the reasons stated by the Johnson court.

Since these cases were decided,

To the extent that

1

Indeed, Judge Campbell, who was the author of

2

the Spaulding opinion, filed a concurring opinion in

3

Johnson in which he explained that the only thing that was

4

truly void was the unauthorized fine, and that once the

5

statute was applied to delete that fine, the remainder of

6

the verdict was valid and could be enforced.

7

The only other comment I would like to make is a

8

lot of the argument today has focussed on whether or not

9

Youngblood had a right and whether or not that was a

10

substantial right, and whether he was harmed by the

11

application of the statute to his case.

12

tried to convince the Court that this is a case of whether

13

or not the court's possessed authority regardless, not

14

whether it was a right of the defendant.

15

Well, I have

It seems to me that what is the more fundamental

16

right involved here is that of a defendant to have an

17

error-free trial.

18

He presented no evidence whatsoever in the guilt,

19

innocence or punishment phases of the trial.

20

absolutely no suggestion that there was any error

21

affecting either phase of that trial.

22

this lagniappe, this fine tacked on to the term of

23

imprisonment.

24

reformed the judgment, and there was no harm existing

25

after that, and no right to any other result.

That is exactly what Youngblood got.

There is

The only error was

That harm was removed when the Texas court
