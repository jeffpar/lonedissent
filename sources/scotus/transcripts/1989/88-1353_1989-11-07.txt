ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. ROBBINS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case involves the overseas search of a

12

foreign national's residence conducted by American agents

13

with the full permission and participation —

14

QUESTION:

15

Mexicali, isn't it?

Overseas is a little strong for

MR. ROBBINS:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

Indeed it is.

— exaggeration in your first

statement, your first sentence, for pete's sake.
MR. ROBBINS:

Well, it's extraterritorial.

It's

21

outside the United States and perhaps two or three other

22

adjectives, and overseas is not probably one of them.

23

In any event, the search was conducted, as I

24

say, with the full permission and participation of the

25

host country's officials.

•

In its judgment below, the Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit imposed two sweeping constraints on such

3

extraterritorial searches.

4

respondent was entitled to invoke the protections of the

5

Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

6

second, the court held that under that amendment the

7

agents were required to secure a search warrant from an

8

American court before they could conduct the search of

9

respondent's premises.

And,

10

That broad, potentially far-reaching and in our

11

view mistaken decision, arises from a not uncommon set of

12

facts.

15

On January 24th, federal marshals took
respondent, a Mexican national, into custody in the United
States believing that his two houses in Mexico would

16

contain evidence of narcotics trafficking as well as his

17

complicity in the assassination of a federal narcotics

18

agent.

19

DEA agents made arrangements to search his houses.
After attempting first, without success, to

20

reach the second Deputy Attorney General of the State of

21

Mexico, the agents contacted the Director General of the

22

Mexican Federal Judicial Police, thereafter spoke with

23

more local police authorities, and from those persons

24

secured permission to conduct the searches.

First, the court held that

Did that Mexican official have the authority to

10

Once there, the

As far as we know, he did, Your

11

Honor.

12

okay, and before the actual search took place, he

13

conferred with what the record shows is in Mexico called a

14

delegado, who is an attorney present at the local MFJP

station house, and who represents the Attorney General of

16

the Republic of Mexico and supervises that —

authority of the Mexican official — I take it you're

2

meaning it was clearly in compliance with Mexican law.

3

MR. ROBBINS:

4

QUESTION:

No, as —

I mean, would it matter if they asked

5

the corner policeman, do you mind if we go in and search

6

this house?

Or, would that do — be any different?

MR. ROBBINS:

7

Well, I think it's possible that

8

if the facts were very different from the ones we have

9

here, it could be that asking someone who obviously has no

10

authority or apparent authority would present a different

11

case.

12

This is not such a case.

13

QUESTION:

I can't —

I mean, we don't know whether Mexican

14

law requires anything like a warrant procedure or judicial

15

participation —

MR. ROBBINS:

QUESTION:

18
19

Well —

— in the authority to conduct the

search of a private home.
MR. ROBBINS:

We do know that Article 16 of the

20

Mexican constitution purports to require a warrant under

21

certain circumstances.

22

in response to an argument made by respondents

23

not at all clear whether under these circumstances a

24

warrant would, in fact, had been required if this were a

25

search governed by Mexican constitutional law.

that it is

1

We, of course — it's our submission that Mexican

2

constitutional law does not control this case and, in any

3

event, it's our view that for all appearances sake, the

4

Mexican officials that authorized this search had every

5

authority that they were conveying to the American agents

6

who did conduct it.

7

QUESTION:

What I'm really asking — you

8

emphasized in your presentation that it was done with the

9

permission of the Mexican authorities.

10

MR. ROBBINS:

11

QUESTION:

Correct.

And I'm wondering if that is

12

essential to your position.

13

be Mexican authorities who had the authority to grant the

14

permission?

That's —

MR. ROBBINS:

QUESTION:

And, if so, do they have to

I don't —

I just wonder how relevant it is to

the analysis.
MR. ROBBINS:

Well, I think that the fact that

there was permission —

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. ROBBINS:

By somebody.
Well, by someone who it was

22

reasonable to suppose — reasonable to suppose — had the

23

authority that they were conveying is relevant in our view

24

to whether the search was reasonable, if you assume that

25

the Fourth Amendment governs that search.

Right.

MR. ROBBINS:

We, of course, make no such

assumption.

4

bears on the second half of my argument, which will be

5

addressed to the assumption arguendo that the Fourth

Amendment does apply.

7

I state that as a background fact because it

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Robbins, I take it your

8

fallback position is that it doesn't matter whether

9

Mexican law was followed in making this search.

And you

10

also make the argument that it doesn't matter whether the

11

United States constitutional — you say that the U.S.

12

Constitution doesn't apply here — at least the Fourth

13

Amendment doesn't.

14

MR. ROBBINS:

15

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Does anything at all limit searches

16

by U.S. officials beyond our borders.of people that we're

17

going to then prosecute, and, if so, what?

18

MR. ROBBINS:

What limits our ability to

19

exercise law enforcement jurisdiction overseas is in the

20

typical case, our ability to secure the cooperation of the

21

host country which is sovereign within its borders.

22

QUESTION:

Well, under your argument, I guess,

23

if our officials could get away with it, they could just

24

not ask anybody and break into the house in Mexicali and

25

do what they wanted.

That that evidence could be used?

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, our position is that the

Fourth Amendment doesn't control the analysis of that

question.

7

about a regime that's not presented in this case, in which

8

we have no cooperation, in which in fact we are flouting

the sovereign jurisdiction that we're entering and

behaving, I gather, with a form of, sort of random

authorities.

16

That is on your own assumption.

That you

I think your answer to Justice O'Connor's

question has to be yes, that if these people are living in

a regime that lets people break into their houses and do

anything they want, we should benefit from that regime as

Well, they just entered the house

without any authority from anybody and took the evidence?

Does that shock your conscience?

MR. ROBBINS:

MR. ROBBINS:

Because it's not applying abroad,

MR. ROBBINS:

And I think —

Why does the Due Process Clause apply

16

No, it doesn't.

It's not?
No.

It applies —

What shocks the conscience unless

it's the breaking into the house abroad?
MR. ROBBINS:

I take it that the shock the

18

conscience cases are talking about what shocks the

19

conscience of courts that are asked to introduce evidence.

20

And so that the Due Process Clause attaches to the

21

introduction of evidence obtained in a way that a judge, a

22

court, a reviewing court believes to shock the

conscience.

2

Amendment violation occurs, if it occurs at all,

extraterritorially and the separate introduction of that

QUESTION:

So, as long as you had such a

you could — you could do it with impunity?

MR. ROBBINS:

claim that we wish to make here.

12

example, that treaties that the United States and foreign

13

countries have entered into has no bearing.

mean that statues passed by Congress such as 22 U.S.C.

Does the Constitution control what

United States officials do when they're abroad

Or sometimes?

3

it's the very fact that it depends —
QUESTION:

When and what does it depend on?

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, if I might, Justice Kennedy,

4

I'd like to turn to that directly because the central

5

failing, we believe, of the court of appeals, is that they

6

thought it never depends.

7

Constitution, as it were, provides a sort of universal

8

declaration of rights of man.

9

wherever and against whomever government authority acts.

10

They thought that the

It applies whenever,

And we don't believe that.

We believe, as

11

Justice Harlan suggested in his separate opinion in Reid

12

against Covert that questions of extraterritoriality are

13

ones of judgment and not compulsion.

14

Court's cases, we isolate, Justice Kennedy, three factors

15

on which the question of judgment ultimately turns.

16

And from this

The first of these is, what is the nature of the

17

right that's being applied?

18

constitutional claim that the person seeks the benefit of?

19

And in this respect it's our view that some constitutional

20

rights do not attach to all persons by

21

and do not apply in all settings by their very nature.

22

What is the nature of the

23

a paradigm case of a constitutional provision that makes

24

next to no sense in most overseas settings.

Justice White, we think that is a very

6

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, no.

I think — in any

7

event, what I meant to say is that the Fourth Amendment

8

presents, in our view, a constitutional provision whose

9

overseas application ought to be by its very nature

10

limited.

11

contest the point that it may be limited to citizens or

12

persons with connections to the United States close to

13

citizenship.

14

And it may very well be, and we would not

And I base that on a couple of different

15

features of the Fourth Amendment which give us the sense

16

that it was not intended, as it were, to be a universal

17

declaration of rights.

18

We start with the text.

The Fourth Amendment to

19

the Constitution reserves its rights to a class of

20

persons called "the people."

21

22

is not mere happenstance.

23

that were chosen haphazardly.

24

language was in fact chosen precisely to confine the reach

25

of the protections conferred.

Like the preamble to the Constitution, it

1

2

suggests a compact relationship between the claimants, the

3

ones entitled to the benefits of that right, and —

4

QUESTION:

Yes, but, Mr. Robbins, there's a big

5

difference between the preamble which says, "We, the

6

people," and "the people" used in the Fourth Amendment

7

which speaks in the third person, which may suggest that

8

there third party beneficiaries to the compact that you

9

described.

10

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, I think, for that matter,

11

Justice Stevens, there were — there were third party

12

beneficiaries to the preamble as well.

13

not the ratifiers are clearly entitled to the benefits.

14

But I think —
QUESTION:

15
16

And so how does the word people tell

us who the third party beneficiaries are?

17

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, the word — it's not just

18

the word people, it's "the people."

19

not accidental.

20

so.

21

Persons who were

And I think this is

Let me suggest two reasons why I think

First of all, if you go back and take a look at

22

what the contemporary versions of the — that were

23

available for the Fourth Amendment to choose from — for

24

example, Your Honor's dissenting opinion in New York

25

Telephone suggested that the Fourth Amendment derives —

1

that the closest precursor was the Massachusetts Bill of

2

Rights.
Well, the Massachusetts Bill of Rights was

3
4

phrased "every subject."

5

for example, tried to append a Bill of Rights to the

6

Constitution before it was submitted to the ratifying

7

conventions, he phrased it as "the citizens."

8

Patrick Henry, in the ratification convention in Virginia

9

came up with a version of the Fourth Amendment, he limited

10

When — when Richard Henry Lee,

When

it to "every freeman."

11

So, there was a sense, I think, at the time of

12

the framing of the Fourth Amendment, of confining the

13

scope of its protections, a point I think —

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. ROBBINS:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. ROBBINS:

Except they rejected those drafts.
I'm sorry?

They rejected those drafts.
Well, it's — it's — they didn't

18

choose any of those.

19

Amendment's "no person."

20

Amendment's, the "right of the accused in all criminal

21

cases."

22

But nor did they choose the Fifth
Nor did they choose the Sixth

And what's more —
QUESTION:

And they couldn't have used "every

23

subject," or they wouldn't have been likely to use "every

24

subject," would they?

25

the best equivalent in democratic terms of every subject.

In fact, "the people" is probably

1
2

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, I think, at a minimum, it

3

conveys the sense that the court of appeals, which viewed

4

the Fourth Amendment as a universal declaration of rights,

5

was considerably off base.

6

The last point I want to make and then I'll move

7

to the other two factors, Justice Kennedy, that I think

8

inform the analysis is — it's worth comparing the other

9

provisions in the Bill of Rights that also use the phrase

10

"the people" because they cannot be understood unless you

11

recognize that "the people" was a limiting concept.

12

The other provisions that use that phrase are

13

the Ninth and Tenth Amendments which make utterly no sense

14

except in terms of this compact that I'm describing; the

15

Second Amendment, which refers to the right to bear aims,

16

which can't plausibly be assumed to be a right of persons

17

overseas to have arms; and finally, a portion of the First

18

Amendment which speaks

19

and petition the government.

20

of the right to peaceably assemble

Again, the notion that one comes back to is the

21

sense of a compact relationship with the government that

22

receives some of the power but in which the people reserve

23

the balance that is not extended.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, of course, in order to make

this complete, the Third Amendment says no soldier shall

that under your semantic analysis it does apply overseas.
MR. ROBBINS:

And I assume

does.

do not rely on — I don't know if I would call it

6

semantics — but at least purely a textual argument

7

because I believe that the purpose of the Fourth Amendment

8

is one that makes it awfully difficult to suppose it was

9

intended to provide rights in every quarter of the globe.

10

After all, the Fourth Amendment, as this Court

11

and every other court has said more than once, is designed

12

to protect expectations of privacy.

13

suggest, is unusually sensitive to local tradition and

14

culture.

15

And that concept, I

It's difficult for courts to adjudicate.
And what's more, it seems to us that

16

adjudication of what is a reasonable expectation of

17

privacy in an American court in a contested criminal

18

litigation or any other kind is perhaps unseemly, perhaps

19

even improper, raising, I suppose, even act of state

20

doctrine questions.

21

Now, that's just the first inquiry.

What is the

22

nature of the right?

23

think that there are two other factors that again move us

24

away from this universalist view taken by the court of

25

appeals.

But from this Court's cases, we

The second is what is the relationship between

the United States and the place in which the

3

constitutional claim arises?

4

5

sovereignty, makes the case, I think, for overseas

7

to win on.

The fact that the search or

fact that this is a separate sovereignty, Mexico,

nature, does not seem designed to have widespread overseas

application.

takes to accommodate that is to say that unreasonable — I

1

Finally, the last factor that we think is

2

relevant is what is the relationship of the claimant to

3

the United States?

4

in Johnson against Eisentrager, more recently in Landon

5

against Plasencia and the basic notion is that , "aliens

6

are accorded a generous and ascending scale of rights as

7

he increases his identity with our society."

8
9

This is a familiar inquiry, one raised

This is a point that comes up in a great many of
the immigration cases.

And the notion is, again, the

10

closer the connection to the United States of citizenship

11

or naturalization or permanent residence, the greater the

12

claim for the protections of the social compact.

13

Now, viewing these three factors as a whole in

14

this case I suggest that the solution is not difficult to

15

find because respondent is at the wrong end of each of the

16

three spectrums that I've suggested.

17

The Fourth Amendment, first of all, is, we

18

think, peculiarly out of place in an overseas context and

19

peculiarly unwarranted for overseas application.

20

Second, this is a completely separate

21

sovereignty.

Mexico is independent of the United States.

22

It's a wholly extraterritorial search unlike, say,

23

searches on the high^ seas or in the Customs waters or in

24

territories in which the United States exercises

25

substantial sovereignty.

1

And, finally, this is a claimant with little or

2

no ongoing connection to the United States, little or no

3

membership, if any, in the United States community.

4

Those factors, we think, taken as a whole,

5

confirm our view that the court of appeals' approach and

6

its result in this case was wrong — that the Fourth

7

Amendment simply doesn't apply.

9

Now, let me hasten to add — I mentioned this —
I adverted to it before, I believe, Justice Stevens, in

American power overseas and I suppose as a fallback

position as well the Due Process Clause, which again

regulates the admission of evidence internally — a

Let me quickly address the Warrant Clause issue

3

because it's our submission that even if the Fourth

4

Amendment applies, surely the Warrant Clause does not.
The court of appeals reasoned that to relieve

5

the government of the warrant requirement — quote —

7

would be to treat foreign searches differently from

8

domestic searches just because they are foreign.
But, of course, foreign searches are different,

They call for different

There are in this setting special needs beyond

the normal need for law enforcement, and a warrant

requirement is therefore inappropriate, and I say that for

two reasons.

decision, a warrant would do little to further the aims of

20

to use the court of appeals', I think, elegant

It would not provide meaningful protection on

illegal search takes place or when the joint venture takes

place without a warrant or without probable cause.

QUESTION:

So the way we have the case now is

13

that there can be no cooperation with foreign police

officials by American police officials unless they have a

That's your position?

time this search took place, had the benefit of every

MR. PANCER:

QUESTION:

MR. PANCER:

Were

No, they were not.
Okay.
And we would submit those

6

arguments.

When counsel argued previously, for the first

7

time we were able to determine that the government held

8

that if this were a U.S. citizen in custody, then the

9

Fourth Amendment would apply and possibly the government

l

10
11

would have to get a warrant.
But many cases have held that this kind of

12

discrimination between aliens and U.S. citizens is

13

inherently suspect and clearly in this case there would be

14

no reason under the government's reasoning for a different

15

rule as to aliens versus U.S. citizens whose property is

16

being searched outside of the country.

17

In addition, there is no rational reason why the

18

Fifth Amendment or the Due Process Clause would apply as

19

opposed to the Fourth Amendment in these situations, and

20

the government has presented no theory.

21

Mr. Verdugo's connection to this country was

that he was forced to be here.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE S. ROBBINS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. ROBBINS:

Very briefly.

Thank you, Mr.

Chief Justice.
On the assumption for now that the Fourth

17

Amendment does apply, let me just say a couple of words

18

about reasonableness.

19

that is that it does not turn on whether the agents have

20

complied with Article 16 of the Mexican Constitution.

21

The first thing I want to say about

I have tried myself to read Article 16 of the

22

Mexican Constitution several times.

23

pages 11 and 12 of our Reply Brief in footnote 10 and our

24

office has not been able to get a definitive sense of

25

whether it applies here.

It has, for example, an exception for searches for

7

The fact is, it's a different constitutional

8

provision and what that really tells you is not so much

9

does it apply or doesn't it apply.

But it's simply not

10

plausible to suppose that agents executing law enforcement

11

activities overseas should be conversant with the niceties

12

of constitutional law of 150 different countries.

What counts is whether their activities, as the
