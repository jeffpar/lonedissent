ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE J. ENNIS, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ENNIS:

9
10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Petitioner's letterhead contains the truthful

12

and verifiable statement of fact that he has been

13

certified as a civil trial specialist by the National

14

Board of Trial Advocacy, a highly respected organization

15

of judges and lawyers whose certification program has been

16

endorsed by the --

18
19

QUESTION:

How do we know that?

That it's

highly respected?
MR. ENNIS:

Your Honor, there is no dispute in

20

this record that the National Board of Trial Advocacy is a

21

reputable and nonbogus organization.

22

seven national organizations, including the National

23

District Attorneys' Association, the Association of Trial

Lawyers of America.

MR. ENNIS:

This is in the record below.

Yes,

that's correct, your Honor.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. ENNIS:

7

QUESTION:

8

And this is all in the record, I take

Uh-huh.
There is no dispute about that fact.
Does the state recognize it as a —

as an organization that certifies specialists?

9

MR. ENNIS:

The state does not recognize any

10

organizations to certify specialists.

11

below, the state took the position thatit was not

12

to argue one way or another about whether the National

13

Board of Trial Advocacy provided meaningful information or

14

not.

15

going

The state was willing to assume that the

16

National Board of Trial

17

meaningful information to consumers.

18

In the hearing

Advocacy certification did provide

Nevertheless, the state thought that in order to

19

prevent bogus organizations from springing up, the state

20

needed to have a complete categorical ban, a prophylactic

21

rule which prohibited all statements of certification.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

How much of your case, Mr. Ennis,

depends on the stature of this particular organization?
MR. ENNIS:

In this particular case, Your Honor,

it does not matter at all because this Court's decisions

made clear, beginning with R.M.J and followed in Shapero

2

and Zauderer, that the states cannot place an absolute ban

3

on potentially misleading speech.

4

QUESTION:

So if it were the Sangamon County

5

Trial Lawyers' Association with a membership of about six

6

in rotating musical chairs, that would still be true, so

7

long as the statement were not false?

8
9

MR. ENNIS:

No, Your Honor.

We do not quarrel

with the ability of the state to regulate, to make sure

10

that statements by certifying organizations do provide

11

significant and meaningful information to consumers.
The state could adopt a regulatory scheme and

12

13

could prohibit statements about certification by bogus

14

organizations.

15

That is not this case.

Illinois has not tried to distinguish between

16

bogus organizations and meaningful organizations.

17

Illinois has attempted to prohibit —

18

QUESTION:

Well, what if it isn't a bogus

19

organization but some little two-bit club that the lawyer

20

truthfully says he belongs to and they've recognized him

21

and given him some certificate?

22

And —

23

MR. ENNIS:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. ENNIS:

That's fine, I take it.

No, Your Honor.

I think —

And the state has to permit that?
Your Honor, I think that the same

test would apply but in that circumstance application of

2

the test may permit the state to ban statements of

3

certification by that particular organization on the

4

ground

5

THE WITNESS:

6

MR. ENNIS:

On what theory?
— on the ground that those

7

statements of certification do not provide significant or

8

meaningful information to consumers and are potentially

9

deceptive and cannot be proved —

10

QUESTION:

Well, how does an average consumer

11

know anything at all about this organization?

12

even listed in the telephone directory in some cities.

13

And how is the average person to have any feeling at all

14

about what that organization represents?

15

MR. ENNIS:

They're not

Well, Your Honor, as the FTC will

16

argue as amicus, Petitioner's statement, like statements

17

like physicians that they are board certified, does

18

provide meaningful and relevant information to consumers.

19
20
21

Consumers, if they want, can go to the trouble
to find out what being a board certified -QUESTION:

Well, so it really does make a lot of

22

difference, contrary to what you said earlier, what kind

23

of an organization this is.

24
25

MR. ENNIS:

Your Honor — Justice White, I think

if the state had a regulatory process, it would make a lot

1

of difference whether
QUESTION:

2

Well, you seem to say it does make a

3

lot of difference.

It has to provide — this statement

4

has to provide meaningful information.

5

what you've said in your answers that whether it provides

6

meaningful information or not depends on what kind of an

7

organization it is.

8

This two-bit club?

9

MR. ENNIS:

No.

And I take it from

But this group, yes.

Yes, Your Honor, that is correct.

10

Our position is, and I think it is the same test, the same

11

rule this Court applied unanimously in R&J and later in

12

Shapero and Zauderer, that the state cannot have a blanket

13

prohibition on potentially misleading speech, as a speech

14

by a bogus organization might be, if there are regulatory

15

mechanisms which could eliminate the deception.

16

Here there are at least four, and maybe five,

17

simple and reasonable regulatory mechanisms that Illinois

18

could use to eliminate any potential for deception by

19

bogus organizations.

20

First, Illinois could itself on an ad hoc basis

21

approve certifying organizations as meeting its standards

22

for what provides meaningful information.

23

Second, Illinois could —

Ennis.

You say that's a simple step,. Mr.

But actually, that could involve a fairly

1

substantial commitment of resources on the part of the

2

Supreme Court of Illinois, couldn't it?
MR. ENNIS:

3

Justice Rehnquist, it certainly

4

could provide -- require some commitment of resources, but

5

less, I think, than the administrative burden this Court

6

has already upheld in the other attorney advertising

7

cases.

8
9

In Zauderer and in Shapero this Court upheld
requirements and suggested that in order to regulate

10

potentially misleading speech the state could require

11

filings of all speech with the state and then on a case-

12

by-case basis the state could make a decision about

13

whether that particular speech was or was not misleading.

14

THE WITNESS:

15

MR. ENNIS:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. ENNIS:

18

QUESTION:

Well, what if -That is a greater —

— if this is commercial speech.
Justice White?
What if this is commercial speech

19

that these — that he's putting out?

20

applying a narrower — or the requirement that they use a

21

less-restrictive means is that really — will that really

22

get you very far if it's (inaudible).

23

MR. ENNIS:

Is your rule of

Your Honor, I hope so because I'm

24

relying principally on your opinion for the Court in

25

Zauderer, which was a commercial speech case, which
8

SUITE 400

1

squarely ruled that states cannot prohibit potentially

2

misleading information if reasonable regulatory measures

3

would suffice to cure the deception.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. ENNIS:

Zauderer —

Is this commercial speech?
Your Honor, we argue in our briefs

6

that this speech should be categorized as fully protected

7

speech rather than commercial speech.

8

9

But because this case can and should be decided
on the narrower ground that even if it is commercial

10

speech it cannot be categorically prohibited, I will rely

11

on the arguments in our brief to support the broader

12

ground.

13

Let me make clear that Illinois has not argued

14

that its prophylactic ban is a reasonable accommodation

15

between First Amendment interests and the state's

16

interests.

17

accommodation is necessary because there is no First

18

Amendment interest to be protected.

19

Instead, Illinois has argued that no

That argument is based solely on the conclusory

20

assertion, without any support in the record, that all

21

statements of certification or specialization will

22

inevitably and necessarily mislead consumers.

23

But as the Federal Trade Commission will argue

24

as amicus, Petitioner's statement, like the statements by

25

physicians that they are board certified, provides

1

relevant and meaningful information that will promote

2

informed consumer decisions.

3

Petitioner's statement, according to the FTC, is

4

not even potentially misleading, and even if it were,

5

there are numerous reasonable regulatory measures that

6

would eliminate any potential for deception.

7

has not even bothered to consider those regulatory

8

measures, much less prove that they would not suffice.

9

QUESTION:

And Illinois

Mr. Ennis, what does the

10

certification here tell the consumer?

11

consumer that the lawyer has had a good win/loss record in

12

cases in court?

13

MR. ENNIS:

Does it tell the

No, Your Honor, not at all.

And

14

that is a quite different situation.

15

record, a statement about a good win/loss record, might

16

imply success, that the attorney will be able to be

17

successful for the client.

18
19
20

This is not that at all.

A good win/loss

certification —
QUESTION:

Well, what do you think the average

21

non-law-trained person would think that it might indicate

or might encompass?

25

Specialized training or —
I think that the -— win/loss or lots of experience?

What is it —

1

MR. ENNIS:

2

QUESTION:

3
4

I think
— we're — we're to think that that

means?
MR. ENNIS:

I think, Justice O'Connor, that the

5

average person might reasonably think that certification

6

by the National Board of Trial Advocacy would imply

7

something about experience in civil trials and a knowledge

8

of basic procedures in civil trials, which is exactly what

9

NBTA certification does.

10

In order to be certified by NBTA, as the

11

Minnesota Supreme Court ruled, NBTA certification is based

12

upon a rigorous and exacting set of requirements which

13

require proof of five years of practice in civil trials,

14

including at least 30 percent concentration in each year

15

in civil trials; lead counsel in 15 completed trials,

16

including five jury trials and at least 45 full trials

17

days; lead counsel in an additional 45 litigated matters;

18

45 hours of continuing legal education in civil trial

19

practice in the previous three years; confidential peer

20

review by both judges and lawyers of the attorney's trial

21

abilities; a substantial trial brief; and a day-long

22

written examination which tests knowledge of evidence,

23

ethics, substantive and procedural law and trial tactics.

24
25

QUESTION:

But, as you've said, Mr. Ennis,

that's — that's really just incidental.
11

I mean, the

1

principle you're arguing for is that even if that weren't

2

all true, the state's absolute ban would not be any good.

3

They -- it would be up to the state to show that this was

4

not a reputable organization, isn't that — that's your

5

point.

6

MR. ENNIS:

7

QUESTION:

That's right, Justice Scalia.
What would you — what would you do

8

if — if Mr. Peel put on his letterhead — instead of

9

certified by this organisation it just says on the

10

letterhead "The best in legal representation; new improved

11

lawyering"?

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. ENNIS:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. ENNIS:

16

the statement has --

17

QUESTION:

The same test would apply.
The same test?
The same test.

But under that test,

So the Supreme Court of Illinois

18

would have to show case by case that this individual is

19

not the best — isn't providing the best in lawyering?
MR. ENNIS:

20

That's not exactly my answer,

21

Justice Scalia.

22

from this case because it's a statement of opinion.

23

24

opinion.

25

That is a different factual circumstance

7

in Sangamon County would disagree with that assessment.

I'm sure that some other lawyers

It's a very different circumstance to say a
statement of opinion, "I'm the best lawyer in the

10

universe," on the one hand and say, "As a matter of fact,

put on his letterhead that I've been certified by this

little club that no one ever heard of that, as applied,

MR. ENNIS:

Your Honor, I believe that —
Well, would it or not?
I believe that a blanket ban is

never acceptable in this circumstance.
QUESTION:

So, he could put on — he could -- he

could put on his letterhead that -- that he had been

10

certified by some club that no one had ever heard of and

11

he could use it — and he could say you cannot keep me

from doing that --

MR. ENNIS:

view?

What's your view of how he would come out if he put

2

on his letterhead that this little club name that no one

3

ever heard of —
MR. ENNIS:

4

My — my view is that that statement

5

could not be banned if the justification for the ban is a

6

prophylactic ban that all such statements must be banned.
QUESTION:

7
8

9

So, it's just overbroad is it, or

what?
MR. ENNIS:

10

it applies to Peel.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. ENNIS:

No.

It's not just overbroad because

He's not arguing —
Yes.

Right.

— about the rights of other people

13

and saying that his speech would not be protected but the

14

rights of others would.

15

itself is constitutionally protected because it provides

16

meaningful information.

17

QUESTION:

He is arguing that his speech

Well, yes, but you seem to say that

18

if the -- if the state sorted groups out and said here are

19

the groups that we recognize and here are the groups that

20

we don't, that they could — that they could do that.

MR. ENNIS:

I'm sorry, but I didn't quite follow

that, Your Honor.

I can follow you.
MR. ENNIS:

Let me — let me point out that the

1

three ways in which Illinois claims that Petitioner's

2

speech could be misleading are not self-evident and they

3

are not based on any empirical evidence, any study, or any

4

expert opinion that that speech would be misleading.
Illinois first suggests that a statement of

5
6

certification will imply that the state itself has

7

certified or has endorsed the certification.

8

FTC will argue, it is implausible to believe that

9

consumers will think certification by the National Board

But as the

10

of Trial Advocacy is certification by the State of

11

Illinois.

12

Furthermore, even if there were evidence that

13

Petitioner's statement was potentially misleading in that

14

way, there are many simple regulatory measures to cure

15

that misleading statement.

16

First is a simple requirement for a disclaimer.

17

Illinois could require attorneys to say on their

18

letterheads that certification does not mean or imply

19

certification or approval by the state.

20
21

Second, there could be ad hoc approval of
certifying organizations.
\

22

Third, there could be approval of certifying

23

organizations pursuant to preexisting standards and

24

criteria that Illinois would find to be meaningful.

25

Fourth, there could be case-by-case review of
16

1

all such statements, as this Court found would be a

2

reasonable regulatory burden in Zauderer and in Shapero.
And finally, the states themselves could engage

3
4

in certification of attorneys, as 11 states have done.

5

Under NBTA requirements, if a state provides

6

itself for certification of attorneys, NBTA will not

7

certify an attorney until the attorney has first been

8

certified by that state.

9

In all these ways the entirely speculative fears

10

of Illinois could be cured through reasonable regulatory

11

measures.
With respect to the burden point that you

12

13

raised, Justice Rehnquist, let me simply say that in

14

Zauderer the Court said, quote,

15

involving commercial speech have been grounded in the

16

MR. ENNIS:

I think, Your Honor, that so long as

is a very different kind of speech.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

First, that Mr. Peel's certification claim, and

5
6

other claims like it, are valuable commercial speech.

7

second, that certification claims cannot be entirely

8

prohibited by the state on the record in this case.

And

First, information about lawyer certification is

9
10

valuable commercial speech.

11

commercial speech on the theory that it performs a

12

valuable function in allocating resources in a free-market

economy.

The First Amendment theory, as applied to this

problems.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

Mr. Marzen, how would this particular

certification on Mr. Peel's letterhead help consumers?
MR. MARZEN:

Well, if a consumer had a problem

experience for example.

5

QUESTION:

You think that would — that a lay

6

person would understand the significance of that

7

certification?

8

9

MR. MARZEN:

A lay person certainly isn't going

to know that NBTA certification means all the specific

10

things that are required to get the certification.

11

not going to know that it requires 15 trials, five jury

12

trials or a minimum of 45 days trial experience.

He's

13

At the same time, the vast majority of people in

14

this courtroom probably wouldn't know what tests a product

15

had to go through to get an Underwriter's Laboratory

certification.

17

He or she will know, however, that the

18

certification implies that the attorney has passed some

19

tests, some tests with bite, that are related to the

20

subject area of the certification.

21

And that's — that's the sort of implied claim

22

that a certification statement makes.

23

it's true.

24
25

And in that case

counsel some limits as to what -- or some questions as to

1

what is left for the states if you recognize the ability

2

of an attorney to say that I'm a certified civil trial

3

specialist, or any other certification claim.

4

Federal Trade Commission's view, substantial leeway is

5

left within a wide zone of reasonableness for states to

6

continue regulating.

7

And in the

Within the certification area, for example, if

8

the organization had a musical chairs requirement or just

9

had the requirement that one pay a certain fee, a state

10
11

could of course prohibit that in their entirety.
The reason — the theory would be that those

12

claims do not — or that the requirements of the

13

certification organization have no relationship at all to

14

the implied claim the consumer would read from the

15

certification.

16

In addition, depending on what the state

17

reasonably finds the reasonable consumer to understand the

18

claim to be, the state could prohibit claims by

19

certification organizations with insufficient

20

requirements.

21

For example, in this case if the State of

22

Illinois had found that a reasonable consumer assumes that

23

a civil trial specialist has at least tried one case, they

24

could forbid organizations from — or forbid people from

25

making claims that they are certified as a civil trial

For example, if

certification and certification by more and more private

Just as in the medical profession, you may

certification is in the very highest traditions of the

3

standards of the bar in maintaining and improving the

quality of advocacy and all other forms of service.
As the study cited on page 2 of our brief in

this case indicate, more than 90 percent of the people who

7

suffered serious property damage, employment

discrimination or had problems with their landlordsr don't

Those'exact same studies reveal that the

principal barrier is because people don't know that there

In fact, in this particular case the State of

with — with far less intrusion on First Amendment costs.

Specifically, the claims of the State of

Illinois are that someone reading Gary Peel's

statement would think that there was an implied claim of

either state sponsorship or an implied claim that Gary

11

Peel is a superior trial lawyer.

12

If those claims are accurate, which we disagree

13

for the reasons in our brief and I can elaborate on, the

14

State of Illinois could have had a prophylactic disclaimer

15

saying that certification is not by the state and infers

no claim of expertise.

MR. MORAN:

There's three reasons why

Petitioner's letterhead is misleading.
The first and most obvious reason it's

misleading is that to the reader Petitioner's statement

or a governmental authority when there is no question on

QUESTION:

3

Yes, but they can't set

unconstitutional qualifications, can they?

4

MR. MORAN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And the

third reason is that on this record Petitioner's claim is

an unverifiable claim as to the quality of services he

provides.

8

9

Petitioner in his reply brief even admits or
argues that a disclaimer in this case would be highly

burdensome, and it is our argument that a disclaimer that

But, again, going back to the medical

because — do you think that this is less verifiable than

the number of examinations a particular specialist in some

medical field might have had?
MR. MORAN:

I don't know if it would be more or

less but in the case of the medical profession research

QUESTION:

But a lawyer who is engaged primarily

in civil litigation practice cannot so indicate?
MR. MORAN:

We believe that an attorney could

indicate that he was a civil trial advocate or a civil

That does not imply state sanction, that doesn't
set a qualification for the practice of law.

words, a reader could not look at that statement and

In both those cases, the courts did not

hold themselves out as being certified by the National

11

those states create a process for recognizing these

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ENNIS;

In response to questions from

3

Justice O'Connor and Justice White, the state acknowledged

4

that Illinois does not have a blanket rule which prohibits

5

attorneys from saying they concentrate their practice in

6

civil trials, even though there is no objective standard

7

in Illinois for what concentrate means.

8

9

Instead, Illinois reviews those claims under a
different rule, Rule 2101, which prohibits any misleading

10

claim on a case-by-case basis.

11

we are arguing for here.

12

for a blanket ban on this statement than there is for a

13

blanket ban on statements that Illinois — in Illinois

14

that attorneys concentrate their practice.

15

To the contrary.

That is exactly the rule

There is no more justification

Concentrate means something.

16

In NBTA certification it means the attorney has spent at

17

least 30 percent of his time in the previous five years in

18

civil trials.

19

Justice Kennedy asked a question about --

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Ennis, I've been thinking about

21

your assertion that the source of confusion said to exist

22

by the Illinois Supreme Court is that they think that

23

certified means certified by Illinois.

24
25

I don't think that's what the court said.

I

think all the court said is when you say certified by the

1

NBTA the average person would think that that is a

2

permission to practice, that the NBTA is somehow an

3

official organization.

4

they'll think that constitutes Illinois approval.

The Supreme Court doesn't say that

5

But when you say "certified by NBTA" and then

6

under that "licensed by the State of Illinois," I think

7

the -- the -- the unsophisticated person reading that

8

might well think that — that indeed the more important

9

thing is that you're certified by NBTA, which is, for all

10

they know, some official organization.

11

Why isn't that correct?

12

MR. ENNIS:

First, Your Honor, that speculation.

13

There is no evidence in this record that there is that

14

potential for deception.

15

evidence, that also could be cured by a simple requirement

16

of a disclaimer statement or by the other regulatory

17

measures we have addressed.

18

Even if there were such

So, as in Zauderer, because the potentially

19

misleading statement can be cured through regulation, a

prophylactic ban is impermissible.
