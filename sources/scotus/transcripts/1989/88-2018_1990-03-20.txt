ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH CLAPS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CLAPS:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is brought before this Court on the

11

State of Illinois' petition for certiorari to the Illinois

12

Appellate Court, First Judicial District, Third Division.

13

This matter involves the consensual entry into an

14

apartment by the Chicago police to effectuate the

15

immediate arrest of Edward Rodriguez for a brutal,

16

aggravated battery.

17

controlled substances were found which were later

18

suppressed by the trial court.

19

In the course of the arrest

Illinois asks this Court to find that the court

20

below committed error when it affirmed the trial court's

21

suppression of evidence by failing to recognize that a

22

police officer's reasonable reliance on a third party's

23

apparent authority to allow consensual entry is a valid

24

exception to the warrant requirement.

25

In this case, the police arrived at 3554 South

the stepmother of Gail Fisher.

location the victim of a brutal, aggravated battery.

4

saw her jaw swollen, her jaw distorted, black eye and

5

bruises on her neck.

The police found at that
They

6

They learned from this victim that the assailant

7

in this matter, Ed Rodriguez, was at an apartment that she

8

described as "our apartment."

9

that this aggravated battery had occurred that day in that

10

She further told the police

apartment that she described as "our."
She went on to tell the police that she would

11
12

sign complaints for aggravated battery and allow the

13

officers to enter that apartment to effectuate the arrest

14

of Ed Rodriguez.

15

that she would allow them to enter through the use of a

16

key that she described as "my key."

17

She indicated to the police officers

She also told the officers that items of her

18

personal ownership — furniture, stove, a refrigerator and

19

other personal property -- was still present in that

20

apartment.

21
22

23

QUESTION:

Did the officers ask her if she was

currently living in the apartment?
MR. CLAPS:

That specific problem -- that

24

specific question was not directly asked.

I believe in

1

that based, on what he asked her and her statements in

2

describing the apartment as "our" and "their," that it was

3

his belief that she was still living there.
That, coupled with the fact that the victim told

5

the police officer —

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. CLAPS:

8

But he didn't ask that question?
He didn't ask that specific

question.

9

QUESTION:

That was his assumption.

MR. CLAPS:

10

He had said that -- he described

11

what she said as using the words she "had been living

12

there."

13

QUESTION:

Do you think that under some apparent

14

authority doctrine that there would be an obligation on

15

the part of the police if there is any ambiguity present

16

to ask appropriate questions to determine the basis of the

17

person's assumption of authority?

18

MR. CLAPS:

We believe that the test should be

19

an objective test of what the police officers knew and

20

should have known in light of the facts and circumstances

21

at the time.

22

In this particular case --

QUESTION:

Well, can they proceed on the

23

assumption that ignorance is bliss or do they have some

24

obligation to inquire?

MR. CLAPS:

They have -- they cannot proceed on

the fact that ignorance is bliss.

2

primarily the ruling in Stoner v. California.

3

ignore the fact that a person who is a motel clerk does

4

not have the ability to gain — to give entry into an

apartment.

You can't

extended, the victim of a brutal, aggravated battery,

In this case the victim, whose jaw we

10

indicated to the police that this had just occurred in an

11

apartment that she described as "our apartment."

12

And so it was reasonable under the information

13

given to the police, including the fact that most of her

14

belongings were still in that apartment, that we don't

15

have in this case a situation where ignorance is bliss.

16

It is certainly has to be a test — an objective test of

17

what the police knew at the time.

18

QUESTION:

So --

It has to be more than an objective

19

test of what they knew at the time.

I mean, suppose they

20

— they meet somebody walking along the street who says,

21

you know, I'd — I'd like — I give you permission to go

22

into my house over there — and that's all he tells him —

23

my house over there.

reason to think it's not.

MR. CLAPS:

MR. CLAPS:

Well
Is that enough to let them go in?
In that particular fact --

about --

6

QUESTION:

And what I'm talking

So it's not just what they know.

7

It's — it's — they do have some positive obligation to

8

make inquiry, don't they?

9

MR. CLAPS:

Yes, they do.

The apparent

10

authority doctrine, which, by the way, is utilized by the

11

majority of courts, state and Federal, that have reviewed

12

it — it's — it's clearly a test that's been working in

13

other parts of the county.‘ Illinois is in the minority in

14

terms of rejecting the apparent authority.

15

But it's — it's — in terms of your question,

16

if I — If I was standing in a doorway of an apartment and

17

I told you — the police — that this was my apartment,

18

showed them a lease, showed them identification, all which

19

turned out to be false, that certainly shouldn't be held

20

against the police.

21

They have -- you have to review in terms of what

22

they knew or should have known in light of the facts and

23

circumstances.

Well, we -- we have two different

questions here, I suppose.

adopt that, means that there has been no Fourth Amendment

violation whatever.

MR. CLAPS:

QUESTION:

That's true.
And the other doctrine of good faith

5

would mean that there has been but the evidence just won't

be excluded.

7

MR. CLAPS:

QUESTION:

That's true.
Now, might not we want to have a much

justifiably go into an apartment?

17

make that much inquiry, if they were operating in good

faith and they do go in wrongfully, we might let the

evidence come in in a trial.

Why shouldn't we say it's up to the

It would necessarily —

record's clear as to how she obtained the key, and I think
the record shows that even the trial court was not -- did

MR. CLAPS:

Justice, there was some testimony —

2

the first testimony by the police officer where he

3

characterized it as "used."

her — his recollection was that she "had been living

that she was residing —

QUESTION:

But when — during the

I think it was a characterization that

But doesn't the police — didn't the

15

police require to show present apparent authority as

16

contrasted to she used to live there?

17

MR. CLAPS:

The rule should be that -- that the

18

police believed at the time that they made the intrusion

19

that that person had authority.

And the policeman is going to justify

it as best he can.

MR. CLAPS:

He said that —
Couldn't that, Counselor?
— she had been living there, which

was, by the way, corroborated by the stepmother in this

case, Dorothy Johnson.

MR. CLAPS:

Don't you gather that from

Gail Fisher or Dorothy Johnson?
The witness you're relying on.
Dorothy Johnson, the stepmother.

18

don't think it is apparent that she said whatever the

19

police wanted.

20

That's the information that she said she heard --

She was the stepmother of the victim.

MR. CLAPS:

She has some interest.

point.

MR. CLAPS:

It may not be.
Well, ordinarily I — it's hard to

That's the word

It might, but when the police

officer — that was the testimony at the preliminary

10

hearing and the motion to suppress.

When confronted with

11

that different language, the police officer said that it

12

was his recollection that she said she had been living

13

there.

She didn't use the word "used."

14

QUESTION:

Yeah.

It was his word.

So, he may have a different

15

recollection at some other time.

But ordinarily, if — if

16

one actually says I used to it means something happened in

the past.

You would agree with that?

18

MR. CLAPS:

19

QUESTION:

Ordinarily.

Yes.

In fact, not just — can you think of

to accept in apparent authority is the exact issue that

was left open by this Court in the Matlock case.
What the police need to be able to use when

deciding an issue on consent is some practical use that

Constitution or the Fourth Amendment.

QUESTION:

The police have a right

Well, it's still not clear to me.

Are — are you relying on apparent authority as we use it
in agency law?
MR. CLAPS:

11

No.

No.

It's a — it's an

12

objective test, a reasonableness standard based on the

13

facts and circumstances and the reasons why the police

14

acted the way they did, the same type of test that's

QUESTION:

So — so it's apparent — it's an

QUESTION:

9

Was Leon ever relied on at all by the

state?
MR. CLAPS:

10

Yes.

It was.

And in fact in the

11

trial court, the state did argue that, notwithstanding

12

everything else, the exclusionary rule should not be

13

invoked in this case because there is no police misconduct

to deter.

They did that in the trial court, but

ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES

AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. DREEBEN:

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and

may it please the Court:
A search that is supported by the reasonable

10
11

appearance of consent based on objective facts is a

12

reasonable search within the meaning of the Fourth

13

Amendment.
That rule follows from this Court's decisions in

14
15

Hill v. California and Maryland v. Garrison which, accept

16

the proposition that reasonable mistakes of fact in the

17

course of making arrests and executing warrants do not

18

violate the Fourth Amendment.

19

supported by two principle considerations.

And the rule serves and is

First, requiring the police to have a reasonable

basis for believing that consent is present, based on

objective facts, cabins the actions of police officers so

23

that arbitrary actions and intrusions of rights will not

24

occur.

In an ambiguous situation where no reasonable

12

there would be a duty for the police officers to clarify

the situation by asking some appropriate questions.

14

This shouldn't entail, however, a requirement

MR. DREEBEN:

It seems to me you're

Justice O'Connor, I think it would

10

be fully appropriate for this Court to hold that

11

appropriate inquiry is necessary when the facts are

12

ambiguous and clarification is what a reasonable police

13

officer would do.

14

To establish a prophylactic rule, a Miranda-

15

type rule, that the police officers must ask this list of

16

questions or the search, based on consent, is invalid, I

17

don't think is necessary to protect Fourth Amendment

18

rights and I don't think it would be an appropriate

19

implementation of the Fourth Amendment in this context.

20

In Schneckloth v. Bustamonte this Court avoided

21

a warning requirement which would have insisted that the

22

police inform people that they have the right to decline

23

to consent to a search.

24

refusing to apply that kind of a warning requirement is

25

that it would essentially frustrate the validity of the

MR. DREEBEN:

It's based

on all the facts that are known to the officers or that

they should have known.

clear that in an exigent circumstances case, for example,

the test is whether the police have reason to believe that

If in fact it turned out that they heard screams

14

I don't think that that would invalidate an entry that was

15

otherwise properly based on probable cause and exigent

16

circumstances.

17

Again, in Maryland v. Garrison, this Court asked

18

the question whether a warrant that permitted entry into

19

one house but not another, but was inadvertently executed

20

by entering the second house, was a valid entry and the

21

Court held that it was a valid entry because in the

process of executing a warrant the officers will make

23

reasonable mistakes and, provided that the mistake that

they make is reasonable, the Fourth Amendment is not

offended.

Yes, it is, and always has been.

resident; that she was rather infrequent a visitor, a

having the key was not a substantial piece of information

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH CLAPS

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. CLAPS:

I want to first say that the

8

statement by counsel, although I'm sure it wasn't on

9

purpose, is not correct about what was argued before the

10
11

trial judge in the suppression hearing.
And although it's not in the joint appendix, I

12

believe it is in the record that the Court has on page

13

137, the assistant state's attorney, Gibbons, in arguing

14

to the judge said,

15

applying the exclusionary rule in such instances of good

16

faith relied upon the police" — "relied upon by the

17

police, it would do little in terms of deterring this

18

conduct and future protections afforded by the Fourth

19

Amendment."

20

and Massachusetts v. Sheppard.

21

"In that case, Judge, the reason for

And he goes on to cite United States v. Leon

So the exclusionary concept was argued before

22

the trial judge and it was in our appellate brief — not

23

Leon, but we cited United States v. Calandra and stated

24

the purpose of the exclusionary rule would not be served

25

by the suppression of evidence.

So we did make that

argument in the appellate court and the trial court.
And although we didn't put it directly in the

question for review in the cert, petition, we did in the

body of the cert, petition cite Leon and argue that its

And to

Where they reasonably,

10

balancing -- where they act based on the information

11

before them, the Fourth Amendment should not be invoked.

12

It's not true that the police officers were not

13

aware that she had property there.

In the testimony of

14

the police officer Entress, he said she told him that her

15

items of personnel — personal property were still there.

And in terms of what counsel argues to you about

Gail Fisher.

therefore seek the protection of the Fourth Amendment.

22

is very possible that -- in fact, I believe it's true that

23

Gail Fisher would have had a privacy interest in that

24

apartment on California Avenue to have sought the

25

protection of the Fourth Amendment, just as she would

She would have a privacy interest.

she had a privacy interest there, then certainly under the

police conduct, for them to rely on her permission, her

consent to allow the entry for the arrest.

This isn't a case about drugs.

This is a case

about the police acting immediately to arrest a person who
