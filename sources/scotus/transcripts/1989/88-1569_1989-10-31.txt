CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS J. CARUSO

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

11

MR. CARUSO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case is whether a provision in the

12

Michigan Campaign Finance Act that prohibits independent

13

expenditures from being made in candidate elections from the

14

general treasuries of corporations is constitutionally

15

permissible.

16

membership corporation, contends that it violates the First

17

and Fourteenth Amendments.

18

court, sustained the validity of the Act and disagreed with

19

the Chamber.

20

holding that as applied to the Chamber, the provision violates

21

the Chamber's First Amendment free speech rights.

22

The Michigan Chamber of Commerce, a nonprofit

The district court, the trial

The court of appeals, Sixth Circuit, reversed,

This Court has said in earlier cases that the

23

government's interest in regulating the activity of —

24

political activity of corporations are sufficiently important

25

to justify such regulations when the means are closely drawn.

1

The prevention of corruption and the appearance of corruption

2

in the electoral process by a legislative scheme aimed in part

3

at corporations reflects a legislative judgment that the

4

special characteristics of a corporation require particularly

5

careful regulation and should be given considerable deference

6

by the court.

7

It is Michigan's position that the potential danger

8

from corporate independent expenditures in connection with

9

candidate elections poses a sufficient compelling interest

10

that permits Michigan to regulate those corporations that do

11

not fall within the exception set out by this Court in Federal

12

Election Commission v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, that

13

the Chamber is unlike that corporation the Court dealt with in

14

MCFL and may be regulated.

15

Now, I am not unmindful that in Buckley and in National

16

Conservative Political Action cases, that the Court struck

17

down independent limitations on independent expenditures.

18

However, in Buckley, the Court dealt with individuals and

19

groups, and not with corporations.

20

spending limits applied to any group, association, as well as

21

corporations, all impermissibly, as the court said, lumped

22

together.

23

inclusive, and not narrowly drawn.

25

regulated to justify deference by the court to legislative

MR. CARUSO:

Why are labor unions excluded from the

Labor unions —
Do they not pose some of the same dangers

that corporate expenditures do?
MR. CARUSO:

Justice O'Connor, labor unions are not

11

excluded as such.

They are not included when you read the

12

particular language.

13

14

labor unions in the State of Michigan incorporated, including

15

the MEA, and they are included.

problem and the same potential threat to the electoral process

21

as do corporations, but we defer to the legislative judgment

22

in this area, and that, and perhaps at some particular time

23

the legislature may see fit to include labor unions, labor

24

unions if they are not incorporated, but they have not done so

25

at this time.

If a labor union is incorporated, it is

QUESTION:

General Caruso, why is there a greater risk

2

to the political process from an independent political

3

expenditure by a family corporation, closely held corporation,

4

eight family members, and they want to spend the corporation's

5

money for a particular candidate whom they think will favor

6

their business.

7

Donald Trump wants to come in and spend as much money as he

8

likes, that is perfectly all right.

9

more 9ense, if you are worried about the problem, to establish

10
11

That — that is prohibited by this.

But if

Why wouldn't it make much

an amount of money as the criterion?
MR. CARUSO:

Well, the Court has viewed that political

12

corporations, that corporations are given by state authorities

13

certain benefits by virtue of the corporate form.

14

given certain benefits in respect of liability, certain

15

benefits in respect of taxes, certain benefits in respect of

16

perpetual life.

17

that that — the legislature has seen this and has provided

18

against their taking advantage of that — those particular

19

advantages given to corporations and turning them into an

20

advantage in the electoral process and in the political arena.

21

Now, the Court has said that the legislature's judgment

And what this Court has seen in the past,

22

in this area is one that we will defer to.

23

to an individual, for example, doctors —

They are

Well, let me ask this.

Now, with respect

expenditure in election, direct expenditure is speech,

2

speech we are talking about, an expenditure --

3

MR. CARUSO:

4

QUESTION:

5

It is

Yes, that is correct, Justice Kennedy.
And I take it that the state must establish

a compelling interest to restrict that speech?

6

MR. CARUSO:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. CARUSO:

9

that is correct.

10

QUESTION:

That is correct.
And that the means be narrowly tailored.
And the means are to be narrowly tailored,
♦
All right.

Then it — it seems to me that

11

Justice Scalia's question indicates that you have to give a

12

specific reason why a corporation of that type presents more a

13

danger than Donald Trump, and I didn't really hear the answer

14

to that question.

15

MR. CARUSO:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

Well, the thing of it is —
And it has to be answered in the terms of a

compelling interest that is narrowly tailored.
MR. CARUSO:

The compelling interest is the fact that

19

they have been given certain advantages by the state

20

legislature for other purposes.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. CARUSO:

23

QUESTION:

Well, that's not an interest.
Well, it's the fact, the fact —
That's not an interest, that is just a

24

rationale, that's just a rationale for the legislative

25

exercise of power.

That is not an interest.

An interest is

2

an evil that has to be corrected.
MR. CARUSO:

The evil is the fact that by virtue of the

3

fact that they are incorporated, corporations, they gain an

4

advantage, and they are able to amass great wealth in the

5

economic sphere --

QUESTION:

But you have just been put — you've just

been put a hypothetical where that is not the case.
MR. CARUSO:
is true.

Not in the family corporation case, that

But in the traditional corporations it is true.

10

Now, the fact that a family corporation, as compared to a

11

large corporation, do not have equal funds.

12

doesn't make any difference according to the decision in MCFL.

13

This Court said the big corporations as well as those less

14

fortunate are nevertheless — may come within the prohibition

15

because we refer — defer to the legislative judgment.

QUESTION:

Nevertheless, it

that does not sound to me like a compelling interest, and it

does not sound to me like scrutiny.

20

deference.

21

MR. CARUSO:

That is just legislative

That is, the fact is that the evil is a

22

potential corruption of injecting monies that have been

23

generated through the corporate process iji the economic sphere

24

to effect an equal -- to unequal a playing field in the

25

political arena.

And this is what the — what is aimed at.

Now, historically, corporations have been regulated.

For example, in Michigan historically they have been regulated

since 1913, and they have been regulated to begin with with

the, first was the Corrupt Practices Act since 1913.

5

was not until 1976 that the Campaign Finance Act as we know it

today, came along.

included within the prohibition independent expenditures.

Here — heretofore, the impediment of the prohibition related

9

only to contributions.

And it

And for the first time the legislature

But in 1976 they added independent

10

expenditures.

11

permitted corporations to establish separate segregated funds

12

by using corporate monies.

And at the same time they did that they

They also —

QUESTION:

I find it very hard to see that, the fact

that they can make this expenditure through a fund in any way

really mitigates the evil, but it certainly does diminish the

message.

interested in what the ACLU says.

7

I am not interested in what a PAC says, I am

MR. CARUSO:

The thing of it is, the segregated fund,

8

they can do this, simply because the money contributed to a

9

segregated fund is money given for political purposes.

It is

10

given, in Michigan it is restricted to — in a membership

11

corporation, to the members, to the officers — and to the

12

officials who occupy a managerial position.

13

profit corporations, it is similarly limited to stockholders,

14

employees who have managerial positions and the officers of

With respect to

And the fund is given voluntarily, it is

Now, if we are permitting these corporations to use

18

funds that have been generated for another purpose into the

political arena, we are causing what the, this Court has, what

the legislature believes to be a potential threat to the

economic market, or to the political marketplace, and causing

an unfair advantage to corporations over private parties.

Mr. Caruso, there is some kind of a media

exception in the statute.

I

1

statute, publish something that would include some candidate

2

endorsement and sell it as a magazine or distribute it, and

3

fall under the media exception?

4

MR. CARUSO:

There is a media exception, but that media

5

exception, Justice O'Connor, has to do specifically with news

6

stories, commentaries, editorials, and the regular course of

7

publication and broadcasting.

8

and it is a news media, they may sell those magazines.

act, but if they are incorporated and a newspaper wants to pay

15

for an ad in another newspaper, or pay for an ad through some

16

broadcasting station, I think they would be precluded by this

17

statute because the exception only applies to news stories,

18

commentaries, editorials and the regular course of business.

But what they cannot do, they are not excluded from the

Why doesn't that distort the electoral

2

MR. CARUSO:

3

QUESTION:

Well, the fact is that —
But here the only evil, as I understand it,

4

is that there will be too much speech on one side of the

issue, funded by vast amounts of money.

mistrust too much speech.

7

MR. CARUSO:

10

Is that right?

We

Well, I couldn't put it that quite way. We

mistrust too much speech, but the thing of it is they get —
QUESTION:
MR. CARUSO:

Well how else would you put it?
They get speech, they are able to get a

11

great deal of speech, and perhaps very effective speech, by

12

virtue of the fact that the state has given them an advantage

13

to develop — to acquire these monies, limited liability and

14

so forth, and then — and put — and direct this thing toward

15

the, in the electoral process, which — which the legislature

16

has seen for many years to prohibit and which this Court says

17

that they will defer to that judgment, even though they

18

recognize — and they said this — and you said this in MCFL,

19

even though you recognize there are other entities that

20

perhaps pose as much a danger or a greater danger than

21

corporations do.

22

QUESTION:

But nevertheless, if the fact is that the —
Danger of what?

It depends on what the

23

danger is.

If you are giving the money directly to a

candidate there is a much greater danger of subverting the

political process by getting some commitments from that

QUESTION:

I mean,

That is right.
So, you think that is a threat to the

10

democratic process, that the state is going to be swept away

by ads signed by General Motors, or whatever.

12

MR. CARUSO:

Well, the thing of it is, here again,

13

insofar as making contributions is concerned and independent

14

expenditures is concerned, in today's society I don't see the

effect being any different.

The evil is that they get talked at too

much by — because money has been made available.
QUESTION:

12

being talked at too much?

13

giving money directly to a candidate.

14

could be very close to a bribe.

that is an evil.

It's more than just a bribe.

it was considered — contributions were outlawed on the basis

19

that there is a quid pro —* a quid pro quo, in other words, an

20

exchange, which doesn't exist in independent expenditures

21

perhaps.

22

that the corporations have an unfair advantage in the

23

marketplace because they are in a position of generating

monies, they are in a position of not being subjected to the

25

liability that individuals are and these other entities are,

I think that it does.

and the legislature has historically regulated corporations

2

for so many years.

3

these corporations for so many years is simply because they do

occupy that special position and the advantages given to these

corporations by the legislature.

QUESTION:

And the whole, sole reason they regulating

(Inaudible) from giving contributions to

religious charities, to religions?
MR. CARUSO:

Why, I suppose it can.

I don't think that

the Michigan Campaign Finance Act prohibits that.

As a matter

10

of fact, the Michigan Campaign Finance Act permits

11

corporations to make direct expenditures and contributions

12

without limit to ballot questions.

14

QUESTION:

Can it prohibit corporations from

contributing to one party but not to another?

MR. CARUSO:

To one party and not to another?

16

wouldn't think so.

17

contribute to any party.

QUESTION:

I

I don't think they should be permitted to

I suppose you would think that the

19

legislature could prohibit the nonprofit corporation from

20

publishing a journal then, the AMA monthly journal.

21

MR. CARUSO:

22

QUESTION:

To do — to say what?
Well, if corporations can be regulated, if

23

there is too much speech, if that is an evil, why can't the

24

state prohibit the American Medical Association from

publishing its monthly journal?

MR. CARUSO:

I don't believe they can prohibit that.

That is not the issue here.
QUESTION:

The issue here, Justice Kennedy -

Well, you're saying — you're saying that

4

corporations have too much power, that there is too much

5

speech, that this is an evil, the corporations gather great

6

deals of money, that they are created by the state.

7

Therefore, we give legislative deference.

8

arguments can be made to support the proposition that the AMA

9

journal, that the ACLU newsletter, ought to be regulated by

10
11

the state.
MR. CARUSO:

But not in — in candidate elections is

12

what we are talking about.

13

elections.

14

All of those

QUESTION:

Not anything other than candidate

We are talking about a matter of principle.

15

And we are asking you to tell us what the evil is in the

16

speech that nonprofit corporations present in election

17

campaigns.

18

equally support the proposition that you can prohibit the

19

publication of their monthly newspaper, or prohibit them from

20

giving to churches, as Justice Scalia suggested, or that you

21

can require them to give to one party and not to the other.

22

And all of the comments you have made so far would

MR. CARUSO:

I don't know of anything like that being

23

This is a

I repeat again that

17

from our view, in this case the state utterly failed to prove

a state interest that would permit the imposition of the

substantial ban on corporate speakers; that independent

expenditures in Michigan on the record in this case are not

corrupt; that, in addition, this speech is valuable by the

I can understand it in a sort of a single

I believe an ideological group — it

QUESTION:

Well, would General Motors be an ideological

group, because all the shareholders want to make money and

No, I do not think it, General Motors is

No, simply because they are organized

ideological in that sense.

What about a trade association, the

Automobile Manufacturers Association, or something like that,

In general, trade associations, I think,

purposes.

Trade associations would be included in —

Civic action organizations,

You have three minutes.
The first point I would like to make, and

that has to do with contributions and independent

contributions is valid.

In the state statute you can.

Pardon?
I mean you ought to fix that.

That doesn't

seem to me a justification, saying therefore we have to

prevent corporations from making any contributions at all.

15

You should fix it the way the feds fixed it.

MR. CARUSO:

Well, even the feds, even the Federal
