CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument now in

Number 88-1203, Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc. v. Richard Sperling.
Mr. Ridley.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN A. RIDLEY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RIDLEY:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:

10

This matter involves an action brought pursuant to the

11

Age Discrimination and Employment Act.

12

joinder in the suit by perspective plaintiffs is governed by

13

Section 16(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, which requires

14

these individuals to file a consent to join action with the

15

court.

16

Under that statute,

The issue before the Court is whether any ascertainable

17

source of judicial power exists to permit the district court,

18

as the district court itself here put it, to offer the

19

mechanisms of judicial process to aid Plaintiffs in filling

20

their class with all its possible members.

21

district court here facilitated Plaintiff's solicitation

22

effort in several ways.

23

disclose to Plaintiffs the names and addresses of all those

24

persons who Plaintiffs considered to be similarly situated,

25

solely for the purpose of inviting them to assert money damage

Specifically, the

claims against Roche.

2

QUESTION:

Would they -- would the Plaintiffs

3

eventually have been able to get that by discovery anyway, do

4

you think?

5

MR. RIDLEY:

Your Honor, that is uncertain, and of

6

course, the district court here entered its order exclusively

7

on the basis of facilitating the solicitation of claims.

QUESTION:

Without treating it as a discovery matter

yet.
MR. RIDLEY:

That is correct, Your Honor.

It directed

11

— in addition to compelling the disclosure, the court also

12

directed the Plaintiffs to send notice to those persons with

13

the notice, expressly stating that it had been authorized by

14

the court.

15

In my argument this afternoon I would like to make

16

three principal points.

things —

QUESTION:

MR. RIDLEY:

And it put its imprimatur on the notice

Did the Plaintiffs pay for the notice?
They would have paid for the notice.

It

was not to be sent out by the clerk of the court or the clerk,

the court itself, although that had been the Plaintiffs

original request to the court.
QUESTION:

here.

Mr. Ridley, we have a good microphone system

I don't think you need to speak quite as loud.

10

MR. RIDLEY:

I apologize for the Court.

11

In my argument this afternoon, I would like to make

12

three principal points.

13

notice is inconsistent with basic principles of judicial

14

restraint and neutrality.

15

facilitation can be gleaned from either the FLSA or the ADEA.

16

And third, the attempt by the Plaintiffs here to rely on the

17

court's inherent power or to engraft a notice provision onto

18

the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and in particular Rule

19

83, must fail.

20

QUESTION:

First, judicial facilitation of

Second, no authority for judicial

Mr. Ridley, you don't refer, I think, to

21

Rule 16 of the Federal Rules in your brief.

That rule

22

provides that the district court may adopt special procedures

23

for managing potentially difficult actions that may involve

24

multiple parties.

25

bearing on this matter?

Do you think that rule might have some

MR. RIDLEY:

Your Honor, there has never been a

2

suggestion as I recall it in the papers below that that rule

3

would govern the situation, and I submit that that would be a

4

rule which would involve the regulation of the action by the

5

district court, as opposed to the facilitation of the joinder

6

of new parties not necessary to the action into the action.

7

The Plaintiffs, in effect, concede here that due

8

process does not mandate notice.

And virtually every court

9

which has addressed the issue has held expressly that notice

10

is not required by due process in Section 16(b) cases.

11

is, of course, because non-parties are not bound by the

12

judgment of the court in 16(b) cases.

13

opt-ins in these cases are not necessary parties, and their

14

joinder is not required for the just adjudication of the

15

claims of those who are already parties before the court.

Yes, we would agree

3

MR. RIDLEY:

But that does not make them necessary-

parties to the action.
QUESTION:

Well, if they had information sufficient so

4

that a discovery order were issued requiring the -- the

5

employer to divulge the names and addresses of all the

6

affected employees, and if that is a given, in other words,

7

would the court not then have power to condition the discovery

8

request on the transmission of notice that the court approved?

9

MR. RIDLEY:

Justice, we submit that there is nothing

10

in the rules which would provide for disclosure for this

11

purpose, and the purpose was expressly —

12

QUESTION:

No, no, I am assuming, because Mr. Justice

13

Brennan asked you if these other parties might not have some

14

information, I am assuming that in a case, a court would find

15

that the names and addresses of all the affected employees are

16

discoverable.

17

MR. RIDLEY:

18

QUESTION:

Your Honor -Could the court then, as a condition to its

19

discovery order, impose restrictions setting forth the kinds

20

of statements that should be made to the employees if a

21

mailing went out?

22

MR. RIDLEY:

Justice, I believe that if there were a

23

discovery order which was appropriate under the federal rules

24

governing discovery, I think that the court would and should

25

enter a protective order against the utilization of that

Is that consistent with the First Amendment rights of

We have no difficulty

with -- Shapero.

involving itself in that process --

12

Our objection is exclusively with the court's

QUESTION:

But you just answered my question by saying

13

that you think the court, if the names and addresses of all

14

the employees were disclosed by discovery, could prohibit the

15

use of that list for solicitation.

16

know why that isn't an infringement on First Amendment rights.

17

MR. RIDLEY:

And I am just curious to

Your Honor, I believe that the Plaintiffs

18

could use a list which they got for valid purposes of

19

discovery to obtain information from non parties.

20

believe that the court should permit them to come into court

21

to request that information to solicit them, and —

QUESTION:

I do not

Well, I won't take too much longer, but I am

assuming that it is properly discoverable.

1

court could restrict the Plaintiffs from using that list to

2

advise all employees similarly situated.
MR. RIDLEY:

3

Justice, only if the court has a basis for

4

believing that that discovery would be used for solicitation

5

purposes would the court then, I believe, find it appropriate

6

to enter the protective order that it not be used for that

7

sole purpose.

8

9

We have -- in this particular case, of course, there
was no request to the court below for the discovery of names

10

and addresses for any purpose other than to solicit.

11

court's decision below was based solely on its perception of

12

its power to aid the Plaintiffs to go out to bring in all of

13

the non parties before the court.

14

we have, not to what discovery might be required at a

15

subsequent date by the court.

16

QUESTION:

The

That is the objection which

I think Justice Kennedy's question is

17

perhaps directed to the at least implication of your statement

18

that solicitation is a bad word.

19

MR. RIDLEY:

Oh, no.

Judge — Justice, we have never

20

objected to the solicitation by the Plaintiffs of non parties.

21

We recognize that they have that First Amendment right and, in

fact —

may have information that would be useful —

MR. RIDLEY:

QUESTION:

MR. RIDLEY:

That is correct, Justice.
— in reaching a determination.
And if, in fact, they obtain that

4

information through some appropriate means for an appropriate

purpose, so be it.

court should be involved in generating that solicitation.

MR. RIDLEY:

QUESTION:

10

But we do not believe that the -- that the

Why -And that is the evil that occurred here.
Why?

MR. RIDLEY:

Your Honor, because it cuts against the

11

basic principles of neutrality, judicial restraint, which

12

govern the courts of our country.

13

should be the adjudicator of disputes, not the generator.

14

here there is no due process reason for these people to

15

receive notice.

16

QUESTION:

We believe that the court
And

Mr. Ridley, as, as I understand your, your,

17

your brief, you do think the court has authority to deny an

18

opt-in on the basis that the — that the notice was

inadequate.

Right?

MR. RIDLEY:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. RIDLEY:

No, Justice.
No?
I don't believe we took that position.

We

QUESTION:

Well, let me ask you, do you think the court

has the power to — to refuse to permit a particular plaintiff

1

to opt-in on the basis that the notice that that plaintiff was

2

given was -- was misleading or inadequate?
MR. RIDLEY:

3

Oh, if it were misleading or inadequate,

4

Your Honor, we don't believe that it has the, power, power to

5

preclude the individual from opting-in, but we do believe

6

that, under Rule 11, it then has the power.

7

QUESTION:

It can review the notice that was sent to

8

these people by the lawyers inviting them to opt-in, and if it

9

finds that notice misleading can refuse to allow them to opt-

10
11

in.

Is that your position?
MR. RIDLEY:

Justice, if, in fact, there were an

12

application brought after the notice were sent out, yes, I

13

believe the court does have that power.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. RIDLEY:

Why?
Because those people, if, in fact, the

16

notice were misleading, those people would be in the court as

17

parties plaintiff in violation of Rule 11.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. RIDLEY:

In violation of Rule 11?
Or, with, with counsel having violated

20

Rule 11.

there was the R.A.D.A.R. letter which was sent out.

1

to throw out these opt-in plaintiffs that I bring to you, why

2

don't we both save ourselves some time; you approve the letter

3

in advance.

4

Can the court do that?

MR. RIDLEY:

Justice, if the plaintiff were voluntarily

5

to come before the court, I think the first question the court

6

should ask is why is the plaintiff coming here.

7

the court be involved in any way in this solicitation process?

8

Ultimately, we would have no specific concern with that as

9

Defendants, if, in fact, there were a commitment that this was

10

going to be the only time that the plaintiffs came before the

11

court, that they felt that they needed that guidance, and that

12

they wouldn't use the court's having reviewed the document for

13

solicitation.

14

Why should

Where we draw the line is that if the court were to

15

require the plaintiffs to come before it, we believe that this

16

is inconsistent with the First Amendment rights of the

17

plaintiffs.

18

QUESTION:

Well, what -- you must be, you are probably

19

confining your argument to the Age Discrimination Act where

20

there is a class action, because it certainly is normal to,

21

in, in many class actions, for the court to become deeply

22

involved in notice.

MR. RIDLEY:

QUESTION:

MR. RIDLEY:

That is correct, Justice, but -Rule 23, the court actually orders notice.

their due process rights are honored.

Rule 23 is not involved in any way

Those parties have been certified as

After the certification procedure, they are parties
And that notice is sent out to ensure that

This is a uniquely — different situation.

Here, Rule

7

23 does not govern ADEA or 16(b) actions, generally, and there

8

is no due process or necessary party requirement that mandates

9

that non parties go out, be given notice.

These people are,

10

are just the same as, as individuals who have been the victims

11

for example of a mass air crash, where no Rule 23 class action

12

has been certified.

QUESTION:

When you say a 16(b) action, 16(b) of what,

Mr. Ridley?

15

MR. RIDLEY:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. RIDLEY:

I am sorry.
Is that of 29 U.S.C?
Yes, it is Section 16(b) of the Fair Labor

18

Standards Acts; it's, it's Section 216(b) of Title 29.

19

there is a -- I, I believe, a critical difference between the

20

notice which is required to be sent out in Rule 23 cases when

21

classes have been certified, and the notice which the court

22

wished to send out here, where there has been no class

23

certified, where no Rule 23 class will be certified because it

24

is inconsistent because the statute, the 16(b) statute,

25

requires the individuals to affirmatively opt-in.

But

Given that,

1

we submit that Rule 23 case law jurisprudence is totally

2

inapposite to what is before the Court today.

Of course, it is true in the Rule 23 class

It takes the

That they, the district court —
They are not parties just because a

complaint is filed.
MR. RIDLEY:

That is correct, and we submit, Justice,

12

that that process whereby the district court certifies an

13

action as a class action, which is wholly absent in a 16(b)

situation:

we have no requirements, no criteria to be

1

QUESTION:

Well, why isn't it equally — why isn't it

2

also neutral if Congress has said that persons similarly

3

situated may join a suit by affirmative act, why isn't it

4

neutral for the judge to participate in the process by which

5

they find out about the case?

6

MR. RIDLEY:

Justice, I believe that the analogy is to

7

those who might be joined under Rule 24(b), under a permissive

8

intervention situation, where they have claims which might

9

properly be joined because they have common questions of law

10

or fact with the claims of those already before the court.

11

But there is no need for them to be parties in order to

12

adjudicate the claims of those who are before the court.

13

QUESTION:

No, but, but is there anything that is not

14

neutral about a judge thinking well, we may have 40 or 50 law

15

suits; it makes sense to me to have them all disposed of in

16

the same proceeding, so I will arrange to have notice sent to

17

all the — all this group of people.

18

say that it is a question of judicial neutrality, and I don't

19

see that there is any bias involved in that.

20

MR. RIDLEY:

Why is that not -- you

Well, Justice, I submit that if the issue

21

is claims consolidation, rather than claims gathering, we have

22

procedures which amply cover that.

the like, all those sections, that law, that body of law

not, I suggest, the issue here.

3

That's

The issue here is the court assisting the Plaintiffs,

4

very actively assisting the Plaintiffs in going out and

5

generating and bringing in those potential claimants.

6

that, I submit, is a radical departure for the court to do.

7

think what happens is that we are accustomed to notice in the

8

context of Rule 23, but I believe that there is a significant

9

difference between the Rule 23, situation where you have

And

10

already an adjudication that these individuals are parties to

the action, and here -- and, and their due process rights

obviously are affected because they are to be bound by that

process consideration, nobody suggests that.

MR. RIDLEY:

There is no

Well, the statute might run, I suppose.
Your Honor, that can happen with respect

19

to any potential litigant who might have a claim out there.

20

And we have never, I don't think it has ever been suggested

21

that it is the role of the judiciary to go out and to ensure

22

that those who have statutes of limitation which might be

23

here is that the court is assisting the Plaintiffs in a

They have

they've got a First Amendment right to do that, no matter how

MR. RIDLEY:

It is customary in the age cases which the

13

courts, the district courts adjudicate, for example, for them

14

to set cut-off dates for opt-ins.

15

dates are not long after the filing of the initial complaint.

having done so, unless he had a very short period of opting-

in, the, the plaintiff could normally follow up with notice.

3

MR. RIDLEY:

I believe that the court does have the

power to grant discovery on an appropriate application, and I

believe the court has the power to limit the plaintiffs' use

of that discovery, and to direct the plaintiff not to use that

QUESTION:

But why is that improper, in view of the

MR. RIDLEY:

Justice, we have no problem with the

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. RIDLEY:

But why, why is that improper?
Because it is the use of the courts for a

purpose which is not provided by the rules of discovery, we

submit.

7

QUESTION:

So you say if it were requested in terms of

discovery, that would be for the trial of a lawsuit which the

If you use it just for

Well, then -- then does, does the defendant

in, in practice in this kind of case have a right to come into

MR. RIDLEY:

6

In this instance, we did object to the so-

7

called R.A.D.A.R. letter, in which the Defendants, the

8

Plaintiffs sent out before instituting the suit.
The facts here, Justice, Chief Justice, were these.

9
10

After the reduction in force, in which over 1,000 individuals

11

were terminated, the Plaintiffs and counsel got together very,

12

very promptly and had a list of some 600 plus names out of a

13

total of, potential total of 700 individuals who might come

within their definition of that class, and they sent out

letters to all of them.

for affirming the district court was that the district court

3

QUESTION:

If a defendant comes in and objects to the

notice, surely the defendant is asking the court to put some

restrictions on the plaintiffs.

MR. RIDLEY:

We do not believe that the defendant has

the right to come in and ask the court to enter a prior

QUESTION:

2

You would regard it as case management when

3

you have got one plaintiff in a personal injury action before

you, or where it was a train wreck and there are probably a

in that to come in and join this suit, when, WHEN there is no

of case management.
MR. FLAMM:

10

That is an extraordinary notion

Well, obviously, we have 216(b) here.

But

11

leaving the 216(b) question aside, if the court had some basis

to believe that these people are going to come crashing

have.

if they see that there is an, an imminent likelihood of a

The district court, through the special

don't know that we need to reach that issue, Sir,

because we have the 216(b) position of -- of the -- of
Congress on that.
QUESTION:

How does 216(b) change it?

I mean, let's

12

assume I disagree with you on the first one, that I agree with

13

the Ninth Circuit.

14

MR. FLAMM:

How does 216(b) change it?
216(b) is a specific affirmative statement

15

by Congress that it's a good idea that all persons with

16

similarly-situated claims be allowed to intervene in that

17

action -- maybe, though, intervene is not the right word, to

18

come into the action.

19

QUESTION:

Don't the federal rules of permissive

20

joinder amount to a similar — a similar endorsement of

21

joining actions by the Congress?

22

MR. FLAMM:

Well, if we are talking 24, you have to

23

start with the fact that people in, in a 24 situation know

24

themselves about the fact that the action is, is out there.

25

In 216(b) it is neutrally phrased.

It just says that all

1

persons who are similarly situated may, through a, through a

2

mechanism, find themselves in the litigation by filing the

3

opt-in consent form.

4

So, I think 216(b) is the clearest statement on the

5

part of Congress that we could get that the idea of a group

6

action is something that they want to be promoting, and, and,

7

and when you apply that in the ideal situation you have even

8

greater --

QUESTION:

Roche's principal argument on this appeal is that —

20

their first argument is that Section 216(b), although it

21

provides for a joinder situation or a collection action, is

22

specifically silent on the issue of court-facilitated notice.

23

Of course, that statement is, is true, but silence alone is,

24

as we have seen in many other decisions before this Court, is

25

an unhelpful guide to plumbing congressional intent either

There is a second argument that Roche has made that

10

Roche, that than the Congress, when they selected 216(b),

11

somehow intended to adopt the judicial gloss of 1938 or the

12

judicial gloss of 1947 that was surrounding 216(b), and since

13

that judicial gloss was less than clear on the issue of court-

14

facilitated notice, why that would mean that the Congress was

15

making some kind of affirmative direction that the -- that the

16

gloss that, whatever it was, should not be accepted.

17

The case law that pre-existed the ADEA 1967 shows that

18

there was no widespread use of a judicially authorized notice,

19

but there was, nonetheless, some case law support for it.

20

will concede that the number of cases supporting judicial

21

notice were, were not legion, but the likely explanation for

22

that in i947 was that the unions, who were the principal

23

disseminators of the notice, didn't need the names and

Section 216 is any more an indication of the government

favoring the court reaching out to bring in these plaintiffs

there is Rule 23(d)(2), which provides for an optional form of
