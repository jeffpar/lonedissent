ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

11

MR. BRODSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case is whether or not the act of

12

state doctrine bars the prosecution by the plaintiff of

13

this action which we say that it does.

14

The facts are as follows.

In 1982 our client, W.S.

15

Kirkpatrick Company, entered into an agreement with the

16

Government of Nigeria to supply equipment on an air base,

17

a military air base, in Nigeria.

19

as part of its defense program.

20

like ejection seats for jet aircraft and centrifugal

21

machines to train pilots.

22

The equipment was part

The equipment were things

In connection w[ith obtaining this contract with the

23

Government of Nigeria, our client paid an intermediary,

24

not an official of the Government of Nigeria — our client

25

paid an intermediary an amount of money which, pursuant to

1

an arrangement with the intermediary, was to be used as

2

bribes to officials of the Government of Nigeria.

3

amount of money paid was about $1.7 million.

4

contract price was about $10 million.

The

In 1984, our company was indicted, along with our

chief executive officer — actually, it was our

7

predecessor — for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices

20

inconsistent.

21

That letter was requested by the

One the one hand, it said that the State Department

22

had no objection if this case would go forward.

23

the other hand, it also said that discovery in this case

might seriously affect — that's a quote from the letter -

25

- might seriously affect United States foreign relations.

But, on

1

Therefore, the district court said, look, I'm not a

2

member of the State Department, I'm not an expert in

3

foreign relations and this case should be dismissed.

4

The court of appeals disagreed in the Third Circuit

5

and the court of appeals made a distinction between

6

something which motivates an act of state — namely, in

7

this case we say the act of state is the awarding of the

8

contract itself — and the validity of a contract.

9

The court of appeals said that we are not claiming —

10

we disagree with this position of the court of appeals —

11

but the court of appeals said that we are not claiming

12

that the act of state here, namely the awarding of the

13

contract, is an invalid act.

14

the contract was achieved through bad motives, through a

15

bribe.

16

Nigeria but that, the court of appeals says, makes no

17

difference.

18

motivation and validity.

We are simply saying that

That evidence might embarrass the Government of

It makes this bright line distinction between

19

When the court of appeals did that, it went in

20

conflict with the Ninth Circuit in the Clayco case which

21

does not make that distinction.

22

the facts is the same as this case and, therefore, the two

23

circuits are in conflict.

24
25

And that case we say on

First, with regard to the motivation validity

In the first place, it is our contention

1

here that in order for the plaintiff to prevail, the

2

plaintiff does indeed impinge upon the validity of the act

3

of state of the Government of Nigeria.

4

state doctrine says that the courts in the United States

5

shall not examine and pass judgment upon the acts of

6

foreign governments.

7

And the act of

Now, the act here — the act of state — is the award

8

of the contract and what the plaintiff is saying is that

9

we obtained this contract through the payment of a bribe;

10

we obtained this contract, they say, in violation of the

11

laws of the Government of Nigeria.

12

should have received the contract, not us.

13

all of that, it seems to me that the plaintiff would be

14

required to examine the procedures of the award of the

15

contract by the Government of Nigeria, what officials get

16

involved in the award of such a contract, how the award is

17

made.

there is nothing in this record or anyplace else which

22

would even indicate that the low bidder would get the

contract.

doing,, is examining the internal workings of high

2

officials in the Government of Nigeria on matters which

3

directly affect the Government of Nigeria because this is

4

a military contract, a contract that's made in connection

5

with the air force of the Government of Nigeria.

6

QUESTION:

Certainly there is nothing in the act of

7

state doctrine that would require a United States court to

8

refrain from examining Nigerian law —

MR. BRODSKY:

QUESTION:

MR. BRODSKY:

No.

— in the abstract,.is there?
I would agree with that, Your Honor.

12

But this is more than examining Nigeria -law.

13

would have to say in this case — this Court would have to

14

say, in our view — is that the contract was invalid.

15

was made for the wrong purpose.

16

bribe was taken.

17

QUESTION:

What they

It was made because a

But there must be many cases in which one

18

—the United States courts will examine the law of a

19

foreign country and say that a contact was or was not

20

valid under the law of that country.

21

MR. BRODSKY:

Well, that's true but what the courts

22

do not do is to say that when the foreign government

23

entered into that contract, that act, that contract was

24

invalid.

25

QUESTION:

It

So you say that the critical factor is

1

that it was a contract by the Government of Nigeria?

2

MR. BRODSKY:

3

QUESTION:

Oh, yes.

Yes, indeed.

And no contract entered into by the

4

Government of Nigeria could be examined under the act of

5

state doctrine?

6

MR. BRODSKY:

I don't think I have to go that far if

7

one accepts the so-called commercial exception to the act

8

of state doctrine.

9

But I say — and, indeed again, the government has

10

been inconsistent in this way as well — even the — well,

11

first of all, the two courts below say that the commercial

12

exception to the act of state doctrine would not apply in

13

this case.

14

The Solicitor General, in his amicus brief to this

15

Court, said the same thing.

16

yes — seems to say — seems to say, because even the

17

brief in this Court is somewhat inconsistent, that that

18

commercial exception would apply.

19

that the commercial exception to the act of state doctrine

20

should apply in this case because we weren't dealing with,

21

as I think one of the courts said, is this the kind of an

22

agreement that a company ordinarily would enter into in

23

the regular course of commerce, and it's not.

24
25

Now the Solicitor General —

But I do not believe

This is an agreement which has to do with the
security of the air force, the military of the Government

of Nigeria.

which would come within the commercial exception, such as

3

we had in the Dunhill case in this Court — it's this

contract.

If anything is not a commercial contract

QUESTION:

So, if Nigeria — if the Nigerian .

Government were buying fertilizer, the result would be

7

different under your view than in this case?

10
11

MR. BRODSKY:

Well, in my view it would not — it

might be in this Court's view.
QUESTION:

Not fertilizer for the military, but

fertilizer for farming.

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. BRODSKY:

Well, yeah, if they buy fertilizer for

14

a farm.

15

that's the kind of thing that it would apply to.

16

would think so.

I think if there is a commercial exception,

QUESTION:

How about food for the troops?

Yes, I

I mean,

food that's going to be used by the army?
MR. BRODSKY:

Food for the troops gets closer, you

know, as a fuzzy area as far as —

21

QUESTION:

Well, this stuff wasn't missiles.

22

MR. BRODSKY:

QUESTION:

No.

It was training — training equipment for

pilots of the sort —

MR. BRODSKY:

That's correct.

All of this equipment was

— that's used in warfare.

Mr. Brodsky, why do you — why do you —

10

you know, in your brief and also in your oral argument you

11

asserted that the letter that the district court got from

12

— from Judge Sofaer was very ambiguous and unhelpful.

13

don't think it's ambiguous at all.

14

letter says very clearly that the act of state doctrine

15

does not apply.

16

MR. BRODSKY:

17

QUESTION:

It seems to me the

Well —

It answered the question that, you know,

18

the court was interested in squarely.

19

doctrine only — in the State Department's view — only

20

applies to the inquiries into the validity of foreign

21

government acts, not into the background of it.

MR. BRODSKY:

2

QUESTION:

But it goes further.

On the act of state doctrine it was dead

3

clear, wasn't it?

4

MR. BRODSKY:

Well, it was dead clear in the sense of

5

making the legal distinction which the State Department

6

makes and which indeed the Solicitor General says is

7

wrong, in this brief.

8

9

QUESTION:

Apparently the Solicitor General doesn't

agree with Judge Sofaer.

10

MR. BRODSKY:

QUESTION:

12

letter either.
(Laughter.)

14

MR. BRODSKY:

16

But —

He doesn't seem to have been copied on the

13

15

That is correct.

Well, we told him what the position

was, Your Honor.
But you see what else that letter says, Your Honor.

17

It says that inquiries into the motivation and validity of

18

foreign state's actions and discovery against foreign

19

government officials may seriously affect United States

20

foreign relations.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. BRODSKY:

QUESTION:

So what?
Well, if I may answer the so what —

A lot of things may.

That doesn't prove

that —

How is a

1

district court going to deal with that?

What kind of

2

rules does a district court follow when the district court

3

judge is not the Secretary of State; he's not an expert in

4

foreign relations?

5

QUESTION:

Lord knows, but there is no way that one

6

can read that to contradict what Judge Sofaer said in the

7

earlier part of the letter quite flatly, which is that the

8

act of state doctrine — whatever else may apply — the

9

act of state doctrine does not apply.

10

MR. BRODSKY:

Well, I quite agree with that in that

11

sense, but by saying that it doesn't apply and in the same

12

breath saying to the district court judge be very careful

13

because there are foreign policy concerns here that may

14

adversely affect the foreign policy of the United States,

15

what we're saying is that although his conclusion is —

16

he's saying to the district court and later to this Court

17

— go ahead and let this case be tried.

18

What we're saying is that this Court should examine

19

that very closely to see whether or not in its judgment

20

this case should be tried.

21

QUESTION:

Not to —

Or it may be an invitation to invent some

22

new doctrine, which invitation you may be accepting.

23

it certainly — it certainly does not speak to whether

24

it's the act of state doctrine.

25

MR. BRODSKY:

Well, I — look, there's no dispute

But

1

about what the letter says.

The Secretary of State says -

2

- the legal advisor to the Secretary of State says — go

3

ahead and let this action be prosecuted, which goes to the

' 4

issue of whether or not this Court should simply listen,

5

without itself making a decision or having rules on this

6

subject, to the Secretary of State.

7

Mr. Justice Douglas in the Citibank case said that to

8

do that would make this Court nothing more than an errand

9

boy with respect to the Secretary of State, nothing more

10

than an errand boy for the Secretary of State to decide

11

that the court, rather than he, should decide which

12

chestnuts to pull out of the fire and which ones to leave

13

in the fire.

14

And we say that that -- that rule,

if you will, that

15

Bernstein exception — while the Secretary of State's

16

views, we would agree,

17

as to whether or not the Court should permit an action

18

like this to proceed, the Secretary of State's view should

19

not be the final word on the subject.

20

should be considered by the Court

The final word on the subject should be this Court's

21

views, because secretaries of states come and go.

22

Policies change.

arguments,

in

When the plea

carefully orchestrated plea of guilty in this sense

2

because foreign relations sensibilities were very

3

important to the government.

4

itself was an indictment which accused us of paying money

5

to an intermediary, not to any official of the Government

6

of Nigeria.

7

First of all, the indictment

Now, the government which is charged with enforcing

8

the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act — it is the government

9

that can decide what kind of allegations to make and what

10

kind of allegations not to make.

11

So that, for example, in this case, the government

12

very carefully decided that the allegations that it was

13

going to make were allegations that an intermediary

14

receive the payment rather than any official of the

15

Government of Nigeria.

16

being taken, the United States Attorney was very careful

17

to make that distinction and to say to the court there are

18

things that I know that I don't want to reveal to the

19

court because of what may happen in the Government of

20

Nigeria as a result of this prosecution.

it's the same in principle to Sabbatino, which is an

And we're saying that that's the same here
I mean, we're saying that this

Now, this is a government contract case.

But what we

10

are saying is that, inevitably, the proof by the plaintiff

11

will have to demonstrate that the contract that we entered

12

into with the Government of Nigeria was an invalid

13

contract.

So we're saying it's the same as those cases.

That it is invalid —
Yes.

— under Nigerian law and ineffective

internationally?
MR. BRODSKY:

Well, I think that's what the plaintiff

20

would have to show here.

21

that the two concepts can live together,

22

contract in the Government of Nigeria but (b) coming to

23

the United States and taking out profits — indeed, more

24

than our profits — in this valid contract in Nigeria.

bribes were paid to get that contract which violated

Nigerian law, at least the stated law.

are saying.

QUESTION:

I would think that if the plaintiff can

show that the contract is invalid, the plaintiff would

lose its case.

MR. BRODSKY:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. BRODSKY:

No, I respectfully disagree.

Well, wait —
I think that's the plaintiff's theory.

13

I don't think the plaintiff would agree in this court that

14

he has to go that far as to show it's invalid.

15

basically what he has to show.

16

either the words "validity" and "invalidity" when you say

17

the contract is valid but you take all our profits away,

18

when you say the contract was valid but made in violation

19

of Nigerian law, I think you're just using words to say

20

that this contract is invalid.

This contract has no

Well, that's true in any case where you're

suing somebody under the Robinson-Patman Act or under lots

24

of statutes.

25

you don't set aside the underlying contract.

because what we would have here is the courts in the

United States examining corruption in Nigeria.

I mean our position is the same as the position of the

Solicitor General on this issue.

Whether you call it valid or invalid, that contract,

Even if the contract is valid, it doesn't make any

here as far as the act of state doctrine is concerned.

18

The proof in this case, whether the contract is valid or

19

invalid, will be — must be from the plaintiff's point of

20

view — that people at the highest level of government in

21

Nigeria took substantial bribes for us to get this

22

contract.

23

The proof also will be because it will be part of the

24

defense, that not only did they take bribes in this case,

25

but the Government of Nigeria lives that way.

You get a

contract with the Government of Nigeria by paying bribes

2

because if that's true, then the plaintiff has no damages

3

in this case.

4

That is to say, if the proof in this case if it goes

ahead — if the proof in this case shows that the only way

6

to get a contract with the Government of Nigeria is to pay

a bribe, then the plaintiff in this case has no damages

QUESTION:

We'd have to call

Well, perhaps --

It's a misnomer to call it the act of

state doctrine then.

17

whether there is an act of state involved here, it's the

acceptance of bribery by state officials, contrary to

I don't think so.

You are saying it comes upon — under this

we've ever applied it to anything except questioning the

validity of an act.

MR. BRODSKY:

But I also — you also don't have the

made the distinction that is being made by the Third

when you ask me for a case on that subject, we don't have

14

a case either way.

15

So,

In that sense, if you disagree with my first argument

16

that they are looking at the validity of the contract,

17

then we have to get to the second point, and the question

18

is whether or not this Court will indeed make that

19

distinction.

20

I say, and the Solicitor General says, that there

21

should be no distinction because, after all, when you look

at the purposes of the act of state doctrine, it really

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS B. RUTTER, ESQ.

2

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. RUTTER:

3
4

Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

5

If there is one thing that is very clear as we come

6

to the podium it is that despite any broad statements we

7

might find in the Oetjen or Ricaud case, or in any of the

8

other cases, the mere fact that the conduct of foreign

9

relations is committed by the Constitution to the

10

Executive Branch does not mean that every case or

11

controversy which touches foreign relations lies beyond

12

judicial cognizance.
And that's an exact quotation, if the court please,

13
14

from Mr. Justice Harlan's opinion for this court in the

15

Sabbatino case.
What needs to be done here, I suggest, is to decide

16
17

which of the several bases that are available for

18

affirmance of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals should be

19

adopted.

20

And I mean by that this.

The case can be affirmed on

21

a very narrow basis.

22

decisions in Sisal Sales and Continental Ore, which I

23

discuss in my brief, squarely rule the outcome of this

24

case.

25

That is, by saying this Court's

Those cases say very simply and succinctly that where

1

American citizens are brought before an American court for

2

acts which violate American law, even if those acts have

3

the tangential involvement of a foreign government — in

4

Sisal Sales it being the Country of Mexico and the State

5

of Yucatan and in Continental Ore it being a Canadian

6

agent, exporter in Canada — that nonetheless,

7

notwithstanding those tangential involvements of the

8

foreign countries, the American federal courts can, will,

9

and should decide those cases.

10

Likewise, I can take it to the broadest extreme.

11

I'll pass for the moment the proposition that there is no

12

act of state involved here, which I have briefed in some

13

length.

14

Sabbatino, when you read its analysis and apply the

15

underlying premises to this case, that you find that

16

Sabbatino says this case goes forward and so, too, our

17

past commercial activity exception which I think applies,

18

and, indeed, the motivation against validity argument

19

which is sometimes advanced and which the Third Circuit

20

followed.

21

And- likewise I'll pass the proposition that

To say to you that I think in the broadest reach of

22

this case this Court is presented with the opportunity to

23

now say the act of state doctrine, if it means anything,

24

means merely that in a case where foreign relations are

25

involved, the Court will invite the State Department to

express its views, and if in that first time in the

2

history of the United States of America, the State

3

Department says, stay your hand, we will then, as a matter

4

of federal jurisprudence, make the determination of

5

whether we should stay our hand applying an abuse of

6

discretion standard.

7

What I mean by that last statement is this.

The act

8

of state doctrine, which is now 25 years old as defined by

9

Sabbatino, but which is much older than that — the act of

10

state doctrine, I suggest with respect, has done nothing

11

more than give rise to a cottage industry amongst the law

12

professors and the law commentators, and has permitted

13

people who want to weep crocodile tears for places like

14

the Country of Nigeria to come to federal court and say we

15

ought not be held liable for our wrongdoing because a

16

foreign country is involved.

17

Let me pause.

I think Mr. Justice Stevens put his finger on it

18

precisely.

This case would not be here, nor would we be

19

without our verdict and judgment, if the people bribed and

20

paid off had been an American company or, indeed, if it

21

had been an American government, be it federal, state or

22

municipal.

12

has done in response to my request.

corruption in a previous regime — and that, too, is set

of appeals in this case, but we do so for grounds -- on

2

reasons that are narrower than those that the court of

3

appeals itself enunciated and also those that have -- some

4

of those that have been argued by respondent in this

5

Court.

6

Let me begin by addressing the threshold question of

7

whether there is an act of state inquiry required in this

8

case or not.

9

The classic or traditional formulation of the act of

10

state doctrine is that it applies when the courts are

11

called to question or inquire into the validity of a

12

public act of a recognized foreign sovereign within its

13

own territory.

14

In terms of that formulation, it seems to us that the

15

critical inquiry here at the threshold is whether this

16

case will involve the questioning or the inquiring into

17

the validity of a foreign sovereign act.

18

And, more precisely, do those words mean only —

19

refer only to a direct adjudication of the legality of the

20

foreign act of state, which appears to be the reading that

21

respondent implicitly adopts or that the court of appeals

22

implicitly adopted, or are those words broad and flexible

23

enough to encompass some additional types of cases that

24

might also be understood as inquiring or questioning the

25

validity of a foreign act?

1

We believe that this case -- the type of situation of

2

this case — is one where there ought to be an act of

3

state inquiry.

4

causation in this case, the case, if it goes forward,

5

could establish the factual predicate which would

6

establish as a matter of Nigerian law that this contract

7

is either void or voidable.

8

situation sufficiently implicates the general policies of

9

the act of state doctrine that at least an inquiry into

1
11
12

That, because of the need to prove

the act of state question ought to be undertaken.
Second, let me address very briefly the commercial
activities —

QUESTION:

that supports that?

15

And that that type of

Excuse me.

MR. MERRILL:

Do you have any prior case

I think American Banana at least

16

provides some indirect support for that, Justice Scalia.

17

Remember, in that case, the allegation was that a foreign

18

government, Costa Rica, had been induced by an American

19

company to engage in expropriate — acts of essentially

2

expropriation against another American company.

21

It's hard to read the case as saying that the Court,

22

if it head the case, would have to inquire directly into

23

the legal validity of the acts of the Costa Rican

24

government, but, nevertheless, this Court —

Wasn't — wasn't

2

the setting aside of the expropriation at issue?
MR. MERRILL:

No.

It was an antitrust action brought

3

to recover damages in the United States and the cause of

4

the damages was the act of expropriation —

5

QUESTION:

Yeah.

6

MR. MERRILL:

— but the defendant who was alleged to

7

have violated the antitrust laws by conspiracy and so

8

forth — whether their conduct was legal or illegal could

9

have been determined without determining the legality of

10
11

the expropriation itself.
I think the reaction of the court in that case was

12

that essentially what was being alleged was that Costa

13

Rica was a puppet of an American corporation and that that

14

type of inquiry was of sufficient — had sufficient

15

implications for the conduct of America's foreign

16

relations that such an inquiry ought not to be permitted.

17

That obviously isn't directly parallel to this case

18

and the two are obviously distinguishable.

19

it provides at least some inferential support for the

20

proposition that the narrowest possible reading of the act

21

of state doctrine, that it only applies where there is a

22

direct adjudication of illegality, is not necessarily one

23

that this Court's cases require that it adopt.

24

But we think

1

the decision to enter into a defense procurement act, is

2

sufficiently sovereign, that the case should not, by that

3

reason alone, be held to fall within the commercial

4

activities exception.

5

What we said in our brief was that it's nevertheless

6

relevant under the type of comity — international comity

7

analysis that the Court has undertaken in Sabbatino and

8

succeeding cases, that the relationship the parties would

9

enter into once this decision was made to enter into the

10
11

contract would be commercial in nature.
So, for example, questions about breach of warranty,

12

questions about other issues that might come up in the

13

governance of the contractual relationship we think, for

14

example, would fall into the commercial exception for this

15

Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and if there were a

16

commercial activities exception recognized, would

17

presumably also those questions would come within a

18

commercial activities exception of the act of state

19

doctrine.

20

So, because the relationship that would be entered

21

into is commercial, we think that's one factor that the

22

Court could weigh under a comity type analysis in deciding

23

whether or not the act of state doctrine precludes giving

24

a questioning — or not giving effect to the act of a

25

foreign sovereign.

I'd also like to speak, if I could, to the general

2

question of the institutional relationship between the

3

federal courts and the executive branch in applying the

5

not spoken to in an opinion enjoined by a majority of the

6

Court and is also of some considerable institutional

7

interest to the United States.

It's a matter that this Court has

8

The position that we've taken in our brief in this

9

case really attempts to build on two principles that we

10

think there is a fair consensus about within this Court's

11

opinions, even though the Court has not reached a

12

concluded view about them.

13

One is the principle that the courts, of course, are

14

the final arbiters of question of law, and the second is

15

the principle that the Executive Branch ought to be the

16

final arbiter of questions of foreign relations and

17

foreign policy.

18

And the way we propose that these two principles can

19

be reconciled in this area is that when a court undertakes

20

an act of state inquiry in deciding whether or not the act

21

of state doctrine should in any particular case preclude

22

examination of a foreign sovereign act that any questions

23

about the foreign relations impact, about sensitivities of

24

foreign governments, about the consequences for ongoing

American diplomatic efforts, that those questions ought to

very greatest deference to those determinations.

4

But that the legal elements of the doctrine,

including the threshold guestions about whether it is or

is not an act of state, in the final determination after

7

the courts engaged in the balancing process would, of

course, remain for the courts themselves.

consistent with all this Court's prior opinions, including

act of state doctrine isn't law.

17

MR. MERRILL:

We think the Court should not question

18

the foreign policy judgments.

19

foreign policy judgments are a very important element in

20

the calculus, the Court should take those as a given.

21

other elements in the doctrine, for example, the question

22

of whether an act is sufficiently sovereign to trigger the

act of state, or whether or not the act took place within

the territory of a foreign government, those questions —

position that even if there is clearly an act of state

involved in this case, that the State Department letter

should determine the case?

7

MR. MERRILL:

Our position is that the State

8

Department letter is not a trumping device.

9

that's the reason why six justices primarily rejected the

10
11

We think that

Bernstein approach.
The Bernstein approach was perceived as one where

12

even if the court concluded as a matter of law that the

13

act of state doctrine precludes adjudication, that the

14

executive could come in and say, no, we want you to go

ahead anyway.

between the executive and the courts.

extent that those factors include questions like what will

be the impact on ongoing diplomatic efforts of the

adverse impact on the foreign relations of the United

4

States if the case goes forward.

5

ambiguity about that, we think that reference to the

6

letter, which is appended to our brief, should resolve it.

7

The letter in the district court we think

But if there is any

In that letter, the legal advisor -- this is at page

8

2(a) of the appendix in our brief — states quite

9

expressly that we do not see any foreign relations

10

obstacles to adjudication of this case on the merits and

11

we also believe that, in the absence of a representation

12

to the contrary, the courts may properly assume that no

13

unacceptable interference with U.S. foreign relations will

14

occur on account of adjudication of like cases.

15

So, in response to this Court's grant of certiorari

16

the State Department h^s undertaken a reevaluation of the

17

foreign policy implications that suits of this type

18

present and has determined that, as a general matter and

19

absent a representation to the contrary, we do not see

20

sufficient foreign policy obstacles to going forward and

21

considering a case of this nature on the merits.

22

If there are no questions, I thank the Court.

23

QUESTION:

24

Mr. Brodsky, you have two minutes remaining.

25

Thank you, Mr. Merrill.

MR. BRODSKY:

Well, if the Court please, first, with

3

regard to the second letter that was received from the

4

State Department, I don't think there is any material

5

difference between the two letters.

6

says at the end, the legal advisor to the State Department

7

reminds the trial court to exercise appropriate

8

supervision over the trial process so as to limit damage

9

to foreign sensibilities.

10

The second letter

Now, what I'm saying is that there are no rules for a

11

district court to follow in presiding over a case and

12

limiting that case to things that will involve foreign

13

sensibilities.

14

reasons that I have given, I respectfully suggest that the

15

act of state doctrine should apply in this case. ■

So, for that reason, and all the other

16

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

18

The case is submitted.

19

(Whereupon, at 11:55 a.m., the case in the above-

20

Thank you, Mr. Brodsky.'

entitled matter was submitted.)
