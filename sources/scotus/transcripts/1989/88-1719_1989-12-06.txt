ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. DAVID JAMES

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JAMES:

9
10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The question presented in this case is whether

12

there is a right to a jury trial in a case where an

13

employee sues his union alleging a breach of the duty of

14

fair representation whenever he seeks also some type of

15

monetary damages, which in this case are the back pay.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. JAMES:

18

It doesn't sound very interesting.
It certainly didn't draw the crowd

that the first one did.

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. JAMES:

It is, however, important for not

21

only these parties, but for the large number of cases that

22

this raises.

23

We contend that there is no right to a jury

24

trial in such a case, and we do that based upon the

25

historical analysis that this Court has set forth we

2

should follow in Seventh Amendment questions.
We have to go to the Seventh Amendment because,

3

like everybody agrees, there is no statutory right to a

4

jury trial and so the question turns on if there is a

5

right to a jury trial, it could be found only in the

6

Seventh Amendment.

7

The first, and this Court has set out that

8

that's a two-pronged test, look at the historical analog

9

to see if this is more like an equitable or a legal

10

action, and then turn to the more important issue, what

11

are the types of remedies asked for in the case, the

12

nature of those remedies and are they more legal or

13

equitable in nature.

14

We say, turning to the first prong, that this,

15

while not recognized in — at the time the Constitution

16

and the Seventh Amendment was enacted — the duty of fair

17

representation action was not recognized then — that the

18

duty of fair representation action does have its origin in

19

the traditions of equities law trust.

20

And we have discussed that our brief — in our

21

briefs at some length, how the union in a duty of fair

22

representation case is much like a trustee situation that

23

was found prior to the enactment of the Seventh Amendment.

24
25

A union, like a trustee, is given discretionary
power to be exercised for the benefit of certain

1

employees.

2

recognized that the union, like a trustee, must act on

3

behalf of these employees non-arbitrarily, must act in

4

good faith.

^
A

The relationship that we find between a union

5
6

and the employees that it represents is very much like

7

that between a trustee and beneficiaries that it

8

represents.

9

trustee has broad discretion.

The union has broad discretion, just like a

The trustee, or a union, can represent employees

10

—-

In Steele v. L&N Railroad, this Court

11

or beneficiaries with divergent, even conflicting

12

interests.

13

where the client controls and tells the lawyer what he has

14

to do and can withdraw, have other counsel, if he does not

15

like what the attorney is doing.

16

That's unlike the lawyer/client relationship

With a union, an employee cannot insist that the

17

union take any specific action.

18

trustee — has discretion to decide itself what to do.

19

And as long as it stays within the certain bounds allowed

20

by the courts in that discretion, the employee cannot

21

force the union, just like a beneficiary could not force a

22

trustee to take any particular action.

23

It — the union, like a

Thus, we say that the duty of fair

24

representation action is very similar to the trust action

25

which was found prior to the enactment of the Seventh

1

Amendment, and it's clear that those trust actions were

2

developed solely in equity, that they were not recognized

3

in law courts.

4

And we say that, therefore, if you look at the

5

nature of the duty of fair representation action, it is

6

most like that trust analogy and it's thus equitable.

7

That's particular seen in the sort of hybrid

8

action that we have here where a union is sued by an

9

employee who claims that the union did not take some

10

action properly and at the same time the employee claims

11

the company that it — is its employer also acted

12

improperly.

13

That is very similar to the old trust actions

14

where a — an — a beneficiary of a trust would say the

15

trustee should have taken some action against a third

16

party but — and it was an abuse of its discretion, the

17

trustee's discretion, not to take that action.

18

And, therefore, in equity courts — hot in law

19

courts, could not do it there — but in equity courts the

20

beneficiary would go in and say to the court, the trustee

21

has acted improperly in not taking this action against the

22

third party, and the third party has acted improperly.

23

Give me a remedy against them.

24
25

That is something that it is clear could not be
done in law courts.

QUESTION:

1
2

What sort of a remedy would the

chancellory court give in that situation?
MR. JAMES:

3

In that situation it was not unusual

4

for the equity court to give money damages as a remedy.

5

It was — they could give the traditional equitable

6

remedies also, but they also gave money damages against a

7

trustee.

8
9

And we've cited some cases and cited some
authorities about that so that if actions of the third

10

party were harmful to the beneficiary, caused it to lose

11

some money, and because of running the statute of

12

limitations or some reason that money could not be

13

recovered from the third party, it could be recovered from

14

the trustee.

15
16
17

Or, it could be recovered from both.

But, in any case, it was a money damage
recoverable in equity.
QUESTION:

Yes, but is — aren't those cases in

18

which, had the trustee acted properly in the first

19

instance, the trustee would have recovered money damages

20

in a jury trial from the — from the third party?

21

MR. JAMES:

No, they don't — you don't — if

22

the beneficiary in that situation wanted to — thought

23

that the trustee had not acted properly, he couldn't go to

24

the law court.

25

He couldn't —

QUESTION:

The beneficiary couldn't.

But I'm

1

assuming a case in which the third party caused some

2

injury to the trust, embezzled some money or something

3

like that, for which the trustee, suing on behalf of the

4

trust, would have had a remedy at law.

5

such —
MR. JAMES:

6

7

There are cases where the trust

would have a remedy at law, yes.
QUESTION:

8

9

There would be

Which would be something like — sort

of like a derivative suit where it —

10

MR. JAMES:

11

QUESTION:

It's not like a derivative suit.
Well, that the corporation might have

12

a remedy at law and the shareholder in — before the

13

merger of law and equity, and all the rest, the

14

shareholder could have had, you know, had an equitable

15

proceeding which would have brought something comparable

16

to the damages that you describe here.

17
18

MR. JAMES:

Let me tell you why I think it's not

the same.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. JAMES:

Because I know perfectly well -Is that in those shareholder

21

derivative suits you had basically the shareholder

22

standing in the shoes of the corporation asserting the

23

corporation's claim.

24
25

Here, this is not a claim of the trustee.
are rights that the beneficiary claims it has.

It goes

And in those shareholder derivative actions,

4
5

they came about, as this Court explained in Ross v.

Bernhard, because of procedural problems that they could

not be brought in the law court.

procedural problem is not here.

bargaining agreement there.

— basically has to rely on the union as the intermediary

15

to process grievances and all of that.

That the member of the labor union may not

So he has to really basically

But he doesn't stand in the shoes of

17

the union the way he does in a shareholder's derivative

18

suit, because in a shareholder's derivative suit he stands

19

in the shoes and he recovers a benefit for the

20

corporation.

Here, he doesn't stand in their shoes.

recovers a benefit for himself and in fact can recover it

QUESTION:

This is

Mr. James, we're not talking about

any tort-like recovery here, are we?

Are we only talking

10

about giving to the union member a fixed monetary sum that

11

would have been his but for the action of the union, or

12

are we talking about some smart money against the union or

about smart money.

MR. JAMES:

QUESTION:

3

Well, I think —
And that no element of it is — is a

sort of tortious recovery against the union.

MR. JAMES:

Well, I think that if you look at

the — the duty of fair representation actions, they talk

6

in terms that you are to get only a make whole relief.

7

You are not to get something beyond what would make that

employee whole.

in Faust you do not recover punitive damages.

You are not to recover — for instance,

of?

Does it consist of the — the employee's pain and

12

suffering, his emotional upset at not — any of those

13

elements ever included?

14

MR. JAMES:

I would say that it does not.

This

15

Court has not specifically passed on that issue, but I

16

would say that it does not include those.

QUESTION:

But we're —
So, to prevail you really have to

show that none of the claims in the case are triable by
jury under the Seventh Amendment?
MR. JAMES:

11

I believe that's correct, Your

Honor.

13

- that those would — there would be a right to a jury

16

If they are legal claims triable to a jury, then -

Of course, there's the two prongs.

prong would be not as important as the remedy section, but

1

purely an equitable claim that it had to do that.
Therefore, because we think those are purely

2

3

equitable issues, we do believe that the first prong of

4

the test, that the nature of the claim shows that there is

5

no right to a jury trial.
Which leads us, then, to the second prong of the

6
7

test which, of course, this Court has said is the more

8

important, which is the nature of the remedies.
The only remedy sought here, which the

9
10

plaintiffs claim is legal rather than equitable, is the

11

back pay remedy.

12

damages, emotional distress damages, but that was

13

dismissed by the trial court.

14

this — found that those were not appropriate in duty of

fair representation cases, and that is consistent with the

decisions of this Court and other courts.

Because of the — because you have to

8

MR. JAMES:

9
10

You have to show the same breach of

duty in that case that you do if you're suing the union.
The issues are identical in both cases.

11

QUESTION:

Well, I — I thought in trust law

12

that if the — if the — if the beneficiary thinks the

13

trustee hasn't acted properly and hasn't collected

14

something from some third party he asks the trustee to sue

15

and the trustee doesn't — says no, and he goes and sues

16

the third party directly.

Yes, but he gets a jury trial.

QUESTION:

1
2

And you say the same thing applies

here, therefore, even if he sued the employer alone?
MR. JAMES:

3

Yes, I believe it does.

I believe

4

since the issues that he would have to prove in both the

5

suit against the company or against the union, or both,

6

are the same, then the same rules would apply across the

7

board.

8

9

The plain — the respondents in this case argue
that the back pay is always legal.

That is, upon a proof

10

of a breach of the duty that there is an automatic and

11

mandatory requirement that they receive this back pay.

12

We say that that's just not true, that there is

13

a discretionary element.

When they cite in their brief a

14

quote that generally at equity, money judgments were

15

allowed only when ancillary to traditional equity relief,

16

we say, while that's generally true, it's not always true,

17

and we've given you the specific example in the trust

18

situation where money damages were recovered.

19

And that was recognized by this Court, I think,

20

in Curtis v. Loether where it says that just because it's

21

monetary damages you don't say that that always makes it

22

legal relief.

23

So you have to look beyond the fact that it's

24

money damages and look at those money damages and the

25

nature of those damages to make this determination.

1

And on that the issue is, is there discretion in

2

awarding these monetary damages or is there not?

3

there's no discretion, then it's a legal type relief.

4

there is discretion, it's equitable.

5

If
If

I think the respondents in their brief concede

6

that that's the line, that that's the test to be followed.

7

And if you follow that test, you find that these — there

8

is this discretionary element and thus these are equitable

9

type remedies.

10

I think that most clearly can be seen by

11

comparing the duty of fair representation remedies with

12

those found — found in Title VII.

13

VII, you find that those remedies are based upon the NLRA,

14

the National Labor Relations Act, that there is a

15

discretionary element in this damages.

16
17
18

When you find Title

This Court has held that there is that
discretionary element.

2

what were the possible remedies he could get in an

3

arbitrator's decision but for this DFR breach.

4

that's true, then there is this wide range of discretion

5

given to arbitrators that I think carries over into the

6

DFR area as well.

7

And if

And because you have that wide range of

8

discretion which is applicable not only to the

9

arbitrator's decision, not only applicable for the board,

10

but also by the courts in the duty of fair representation

11

area, the remedy, the nature of the remedy, is an

12

equitable remedy and not a legal remedy.

13

When you take that prong, the stronger of the

14

two prongs, and it clearly says that the remedies are

equitable, and attach it to the first prong which says

16

that the nature of the action was basically an equitable -

17

- like an equitable — not exactly the same, but like the

18

old trust action — then I conclude that the action here,

19

the duty of fair representation action in this sort of

20

hybrid situation, is an equitable action, does not call

21

for a jury trial under the Seventh Amendment, and that the

22

district court was incorrect below when they denied our

If there are, this Court has said

in its past decisions, that the Seventh Amendment applies

and that my clients, or respondents, are entitled to a

jury trial.
Now, in response — or in his argument, the

5
6

petitioner states, or tries to wrap the entire action in a

7

trust cloak, so to speak, and tries to say that because

8

this action has some resemblance to a trust, that that

9

analogy should pervade the entire analysis and go off over

10

to the second prong of the Ross test.

11

since there maybe some resemblance to a trust, that the

remedy sought in this case should be considered trust

remedy.

And, therefore,

We contend that that analogy does not fit for a

number of reasons.

MR. ELLIOT:

I think the answer should be the

But perhaps it's not quite as clear.

In a case

a legal malpractice case because we have no company to pay

where the focus is.

because the employer is either here or not here.

4

MR. ELLIOT:

The only way it changes — I don't

5

think it really changes the constitutional analysis.

6

it does change the analogy to some extent because since we

are suing the union only in this case at this point in

legal malpractice case where you are suing the lawyer for

10

failing to represent you before a court or an arbitration

MR. ELLIOT:

That's my point, Your Honor.

My

8

point is that in this case we're not talking about a great

9

discretionary duty.

We're talking about an absolute duty

to these union members to represent them on a grievance,

which is a duty much more akin to the duty of a lawyer

than it is to the duty of a trustee.

According to the change of operations procedure,

my clients were supposed to have seniority over the people

who were actively working — I mean, over the people who

were not actively working, regardless of their continuous

company seniority when they came in.

14

We have contended that the union in this case

15

discriminated, that they sided with the locals to try to

16

get the locals back on the board — the active employment

17

— so that they would all dovetail and my clients would

18

lose their rights.

That was the first aspect of our case, and

But there are several other reasons the trust

analogy does not fit.

Trust, as I understand it, was

6

created by the courts of equity because courts of law did

7

not recognize the distinction between legal and beneficial

8

title.

9

Therefore, beneficiaries — beneficiaries had no

10

rights before courts of law and the re — courts of equity

11

recognized rights — that there was no adequate remedy at

law.

of equity.

14

So these trusts — beneficiaries had to go to courts

There's no property in this case.

And that was

15

it — an absolute essential element of a trust, that there

16

be a corpus.

17

Now, the petitioner tries to argue that the

18

contract rights was property in this case.

19

contend that the only thing about this case that resembles

20

the trust relationship is the relationship itself.

21

that relationship is recognized and was recognized at law

22

just as well as it was at equity.

But I'd

It's — it's the confidential relationship

Ross — there's no difference between that relationship

2

and the relationship we have here.
And if the only thing that resembles a trust is

3
4

the relationship which was also recognized at law, the

trust analogy loses — loses its force, its persuasive

this Court in the DFR — 301 DFR area indicates that this

12

— that monetary damages is a form of legal relief.

13

Even the Steele case said that.

The Steele

decision, while saying it was a grant of power to act on

15

behalf of another — which inferred some relationship not

16

necessarily trust, Steele also said that the full range of

judicial remedies should be available to a victim of the

breach of duty of fair representation, including

injunction and damages.

of the individual.

3

And I believe this Court underscored that

4

principle once again in its decision yesterday in the

5

Breininger case, that there are two different types of

6

actions, two different sets — at least, to some extent,

7

two different sets of policies and two different sets of

8

rules because one was created or implied — or one was

9

recognized by the board according to a statute and the

10

other was recognized by this Court and implied —

11

developed by this Court.

12
13

And in the Faust case I think it becomes even
clearer in the concurring opinion by Justice Blackmun.
Justice Blackmun stated, along with three other members of

ml
15

this Court, that punitive damages — there should be no

16

per se rule against punitive damages because Steele

17

recognized the full range of judicial remedies.

18

should include punitive damages.

19

And that

Now, this Court, as a matter of federal labor

20

policy, the majority decided to strike punitive damages at

21

least in that kind of action.

22

while limiting the range of remedies, this Court has

23

always at least implicitly recognized that we're dealing

24

with legal relief.

The last point I'd like to make on the second

restitutionary, whether it's ancillary to or incidental to

theory in that case, it's not in this case.
