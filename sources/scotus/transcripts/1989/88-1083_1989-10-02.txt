ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This case concerns the interpretation of the law

19

enforcement exemption to the Freedom of Information Act.

20

exemption, Exemption 7, provides that the Act "does not apply

21

to matters that are records or information compiled for law

22

enforcement purposes" if the production of the records or

23

information would produce any one of six enumerated harms.

24

This Court has repeatedly recognized the importance of the

25

public and private interests that are protected by Exemption

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, do you know anything about how

3

the parties all got this John Doe denomination in the District

4

Court?

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

There was the proceeding -- the Court of

6

Appeals granted a motion for the proceedings on appeal to

7

proceed under seal, and as a result of that, the — the — we

have -- we

10

Agency and John Doe Government Agency.

11

12

just continued under that practice because that was the order

13

in the Court of Appeals.

19

that -- at least with the names under seal, so that the public

20

would not know.

21

QUESTION:

Thank you.

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

As I have said, the Court has repeatedly

23

recognized the importance of these law enforcement interests,

24

and after Abramson was decided, Congress in fact built upon

25

Abramson.and expanded the coverage of Exemption 7, to ensure

1

that law enforcement information would be protected

2

irrespective of the format in which it was collected.

3

Foremost among the purposes of Exemption 7, as this

4

Court and Congress have repeatedly stated, was to protect -the

5

government's case from interference.

6

this case well illustrate the importance of Exemption 7 in

7

this regard.

9

The circumstances of

The Freedom of Information Act request was submitted in
the context of an ongoing grand jury proceeding.

It was

10

submitted by a target of that investigation, and the District

11

Court specifically found that the -- this -- that production

12

of the documents would jeopardize the proceedings.

13

of Appeals —

14

QUESTION:

The Court

Mr. Kneedler, at the time the request was

15

made here, had the documents in your view been compiled or

16

were they compiled after the request was made?

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

The documents were compiled after the

18

request was made, but in our view they were — they were

19

compiled -- compiled for law enforcement purposes; they were

20

compiled for law enforcement purposes before the request was

21

denied.

investigation and filed a FOIA request in September of 1986

2

with the John Doe Agency, the auditing agency involved in the

3

case.

4

That agency consulted with the law enforcement agency

5

involved in the case, and on the advice of that law

6

enforcement agency, denied the request on November 18.

7

then on November 20th, the documents deemed responsive to the

8

FOIA request were transferred from the first agency to the

9

second agency.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

And

What constituted the compilation?
I — I think — I think most — in the

12

sense that the statute uses the term compilation, I think that

13

once the, the Department of Justice, in this -- in the course

14

of this consultation said yes, indeed, these documents are

15

relevant to our investigation, we want them, and don't

16

disclose them, we think at that point the records were, were

17

gathered together or incorporated --

18
19
20
21
22

23
24
25

QUESTION:

The request by the agency to withhold them

constitutes a compilation, in your view?
MR. KNEEDLER:
they could be.
QUESTION:

Well, there are several senses in which

I — I think — I think the initial sense -Is that what you are asking us to adopt as

the rule?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

The Court doesn't have to adopt

that — the Court doesn't have to go that far in this case

1

because the records were subsequently transphysically

2

transferred to the second agency, and they are included in a

3

larger collection of documents that the second agency has.

4
5
6

QUESTION:

Well, one could take the position that you

have to physically assemble the documents somehow, I suppose?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Or, or gather them, take, take them

7

together.

8

suppose, of, of the Act.

9

second agency gathered the documents, put them -- put them in

11

That, that would be one possible construction, I
And here that was done, because the

its files, which concededly, its files concededly —
QUESTION:

Well, depending upon the timing.

Now, you

12

could read the statute as meaning they have to be compiled

13

when the request is made, I suppose?

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

I, I don't think that -- I don't think

15

that construction would be — would fit with the sense of the

16

statute.

17

there should be a race to the documents in the sense of who

18

has a prior lien on them, or something like that.

19
20

This isn't a situation in which there -- in which

QUESTION:

This --

When do you say, Mr. Kneedler, they were

compiled?

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

Excuse me, when?

When?
When.

Well, in our -- it is our view

24

that they were compiled at the time that the second agency,

MR. KNEEDLER:

After the first agency

Well, the second is the FBI, is that it?
Uh, yes.

Uh —

And the first is DCAA?
Uh, yes.

Yes, that is — yes.

Were they ever compiled by DCAA?
Yes.

DCA — DCAA retrieved the

10

documents from its files and at that -- consulted with the

11

FBI, and the FBI said yes, those documents are relevant to the

12

-- to the investigation.

13

the status of being compiled for law enforcement purposes.

14

our view, the statute was --

15

QUESTION:

At that point, the documents took on
In

At that point, before the transfer of the

16

document to the FBI?

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

We think that they were compiled

18

even before that.

The Court doesn't have to reach that, that

19

question in this case because in any event by the time the

20

District Court was asked to act in this case the documents had

21

been transferred.

22

-- they had the status of being compiled for law enforcement

23

purposes in the files of the second agency, and they were no -

24

-they wouldn't have been improperly withheld at that point

25

because the information they contained was compiled by — by

At that point, at the very least, they were

the second agency.
QUESTION:

Under your approach, though, don't we run

3

into something of an ante litem motem problem?

4

the -- the government just undertake this compilation after it

5

knows that the documents are going to be requested?

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

I mean, can

Well, as — as long as, as long as the

7

documents become protected at any period of time, the — the

8

exemption applies.

9

if the exemption doesn't apply after a certain period of time.

And that — and -- and by the same token,

10

For example under Exemption 7, if a grand jury investigation

11

terminates, then under Exemption 7(A) that exemption would no

12

longer apply, because the documents are -- would no longer be

13

serving the purpose for — for which they were gathered in a

14

pending proceeding.

15

So, what — what we are saying is that — is that — an

16

investigation is a dynamic thing.

17

investigation came in, or the FOIA request came in right in

18

the middle, or actually fairly early in the investigation.

19

And it's -- it's not necessarily true that the investigating

20

agency would have all of the information yet in hand.

21

fact in this case, the FOIA request may well have alerted the

22

agency to particular documents in its possession that were

23

relevant to the investigation.

QUESTION:

And on -- at this case the

Mr. Kneedler, why was the transfer to the

FBI so promptly made?

MR. KNEEDLER:

12

documents at issue here were submitted to the -- to the grand

13

jury after -- after they were received by, by the agency.

14

QUESTION:

I take it that, in some circumstances, the

15

audit agency could itself assert this exemption, if it thought

16

a fraud had been committed and it was compiling documents?

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

18

QUESTION:

Uh, yes --

In other words, it is not necessary that the

FBI be implicated at all?

QUESTION:

Was it necessary in this case to find that

it was the FBI's request that triggered the exemption?

Therefore, I — I would just like to urge the Court

MR. KNEEDLER:

It, it was not, because I think if the -

- again that makes it vivid, but if — but, but even, even if,

10

even if the DCAA had never — had never consulted with the

11

FBI, that -- after it retrieved the documents, looked at them

12

and said we know these are relevant to this ongoing

13

investigation, and denied it on that ground and then

14

transferred them to the FBI, the same result would obtain

15

because —

16
17

QUESTION:

Well, then, it wasn't the FBI request that

triggered the exemption?

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, there was consultation between the

19

two.

20

the idea or the decision to withhold them.

21

22

United States Attorney the records were denied.

over criminal investigations.

Section 533 directs the

2

Attorney General to appoint officials to — investigate and

3

prosecute crimes against the United States; the U.S. attorneys

4

have that responsibility.

5

Department of Justice is given responsibility to litigate

6

cases involving the United States -- including securing

7

evidence.

8

when there is a criminal investigation going on, that it is

9

entirely proper that the Justice Department be consulted and

And under Section 516, the

So those statutory provisions at least mean that

10

that the Justice Department have at least a primary say in

11

whether the documents should be withheld.
QUESTION:

12

Mr. Kneedler, it is a very strange result,

13

isn't it, that had the agency complied with the request before

14

consulting with the FBI, or had it decided not to consult, the

15

document would have been openly available to the public.

16

Right?

17

QUESTION:

Or, had the request be -- been made before

18

the FBI decided to compile the documents, that -- anybody

19

could have gotten the documents?

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

Right?

Maybe -- maybe I misspoke, but at

21

the time -- at, at the time the request came in, there was

22

already a criminal investigation going on.

QUESTION:

But the documents hadn't been compiled for

that criminal investigation, according to your theory.

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, I — I think what -- presumably,

whenever it was requested, at least after the criminal

investigation was initiated, whenever it was requested and had

10

been retrieved by the agency, the same result would have

followed.

QUESTION:

If the agency consulted the FBI.

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, no, as I , as I -- as I say, that

happened in this case and that makes — that makes it clear,

but if the agency on its own said this is relevant to an

No, no, what I — and that's —

It means he produced it, right, didn't he?

He accomplished it himself.

Can't it bear that meaning?

It could bear that meaning, but, but

Right, and the protection against any,

14

any suggestion of, of overreaching or abuse is to check to see

whether the particular record or information satisfies one of

the (inaudible) of harms that Congress was concerned about.

17

In, in — in Abramson this Court said, in, in

construing this exact compiled-for-law-enforcement-purposes

19

provision, said it is critical that the compiled-for-law-

20

enforcement requirement be construed to avoid the release of

21

information that would produce the undesirable result

22

specified.

that information the Congress was especially concerned about

wouldn't fall between the cracks.

Congress in 1986, after Abramson, amended Exemption 7(A) and,

3

and — to provide not simply that records compiled for law

5

enforcement purposes, could be withheld.

6

absence of the word information that was of significance to

7

the dissenters in Abramson because the Act at that point only

8

referred to records.

9

And it was the

And in fact the pertinent Senate report, as this Court

10

recognized in, in Reporters Committee, was one prepared in

11

1983, specifically endorses Abram — Abramson and says that

12

these amendments which were intended to ease the burden of law

13

enforcement agencies were "intended to ensure that sensitive

14

law enforcement information is protected under Exemption 7

15

regardless of the particular format or record in which -- in

16

which the record is maintained."

17

So, it is obvious that Congress was endorsing the view

18

that this Court took in Abramson, that it is necessary to

19

focus on whether the information that is at issue would

20

produce, as long as it is categorized or identified for law

21

enforcement purposes, would produce one of the six enumerated

MR. EISENBERG:

MR. EISENBERG:

Well, let me, let me -- I want to make

a full response to the Court's question, because that is a

decision the Court must decide, this Court must decide,

5

whether to affirm or reverse.

6

The government, relying on Exemption 3 in the Court of

7

Appeals, could make all of the same arguments for not

8

disclosing these documents because they were grand jury

9

materials, without having to meet any threshold requirement.

10

And since they had made no record in the trial court

11

and there was no record in the Court of Appeals suggesting

12

remotely any of the things that have been suggested in the

13

Supreme Court as the factual basis for such a determination,

14

the, the government had a way of defending the withholding of

15

the documents that avoided entirely the issue that Justice

White has directed attention to:

Having made that tactical decision and lost on the

And

We might call such high-handed conduct by many names,

sugarcoating it, that is just what the FBI did in this case.

By doing that, they thwarted the administrative process in

You wouldn't have to use both words if the

government's interpretation of Exemption 7 have merit.

3

If I may borrow a phrase from the government's Reply

4

Brief, it would trivialize Exemption 7's threshold test, to

5

equate the conduct in this case with the compilation of

6

information or records for law enforcement purpose.

7

the focus on semantics and grammar in briefs, the argument

8

between the corporation and the government is not just over

9

words.

Despite

What the government really is concerned about is the

10

ability of the subject -- of a subject of an investigation to

11

obtain any information, any evidence that might be useful to

12

the subject of the investigation which he could not obtain

13

prior to or unless he is indicted under the federal rules of

14

criminal procedure.

15

It's because of those provisions in Exemption 7 that

16

the President vetoed the 1974 bill, that the Attorney General

17

testified, strenuously opposed it, and the FBI was apoplectic.

18

Prosecutors much prefer a system under which they can carry on

their investigations with two, three or, in this case, over

MR. KNEEDLER:

Thank you.

There are several points I'd.

like to bring to the -- to the Court's attention in, in the

23

discussion that is focused on the word compiled.

is important to understand what Congress was driving at and

I think it

to be driving at.

2

Exemption 7 is, is an exemption of substance and not one of

3

technicalities.

4

Because, as this Court said in Abramson,

The first — the first thing I want to point out is a

5

passage from the Attorney General's memorandum, page 6 of the

6

Attorney General's memorandum on the 1974 amendments to FOIA,

7

which is discussed in the District Court's opinion in Hatcher,

8

which is discussed in the briefs, and it's the same page of

9

the Attorney General's memorandum that was discussed by this

10

Court in footnote 5 of Abramson.

11

or there the Attorney General, in explaining the recently

12

enacted — amendments, states that although ordinarily records

13

used in monitoring agencies would not -- or activities, would

14

not be covered by Exemption 7, it then continues to say except

15

where the purpose for which the records are held and used by .

16

the agency becomes substantially violation oriented, i.e.,

17

becomes refocused on preventing, discovering or applying

18

sanctions against non-compliance with federal statutes or

19

regulations.

20

And there the Court says --

So here we have a contemporaneous construction of the

21

statute by the Attorney General in a memorandum that this

22

Court has relied upon and agencies have relied on ever since,

23

saying that the status of records, once they become refocused

24

on a -- on an exemption, is relevant.

Philip Hart of Michigan, who was the sponsor of the amendment,

2

described the threshold in the same sort of pragmatic terms in

3

the same passage, another portion of which the Court discussed

4

in Robbins Tire.

is broadly written, but he wanted to point out that the

material cannot be exempt merely because it can be

trying to — explain is what the — what the amendment refers

to.

12

And then he says in broad terms, the amendment — the

13

exemption would apply whenever the government's case in court,

14

a concrete prospective law enforcement proceeding, would be

15

harmed by the premature release of evidence or information not

In your view, could anything in the
