ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY R. SIEGEL

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SIEGEL:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue before the Court today is whether the

11
12

territory of Guam is liable for deprivations of civil

13

rights.

14

one, possibly two other questions.

15

whether the territory is a person for the purpose of the

16

Civil Rights Act, and if it is, whether there is some

17

other form of sovereign immunity which may protect the

18

territory from liability.

To answer that question the Court must address
The first of these is

Any analysis of the word person in the

19
20

Dictionary Act must begin with the Dictionary Act.

21

Dictionary Act, passed only months before the Civil Rights

22

Act in 1871, defined persons to include bodies politic and

23

corporate.

24

that the territory of Puerto Rico was indeed a body

25

politic, and the Third Circuit has held that the territory

The

1

of the Virgin Islands was a body politic as well.

2

Indeed, if we examine the nature of the

3

territory and the self-government invested in the

4

territory by the Organic Act we will find, I think, that -

5

- that it makes sense to conclude that territory is indeed

6

a body politic.

7

territory.

8

local representatives and congressmen and a non-voting

9

delegate to Congress.

There are free elections in the

The citizens of the territory elect their

Indeed, there are also local

10

courts, and a quite vibrant and active democracy exists in

11

Guam.

12

There has been some suggestion, however, that

13

the Dictionary Act is not applicable in defining, or at

14

least has been somewhat diminished in defining the word

15

person.

16

is the fact that the 1871 act was taken from the 1866

17

Civil Rights Act, specifically Section 2.

18

Congress, in the intervening period, did pass the Civil

19

Rights Act, and that is persuasive evidence that Congress

20

intended to apply that definition to the word person in

21

Section 1983.

22

The first basis on which this has been suggested

However,

Respondents have argued that the 1874 revision

23

and recodification of laws, and the repeal and reenactment

24

of the Dictionary Act, somehow overrides this Court's

25

finding in Monell that indeed the Dictionary Act is

1

applicable to this term.

2

1874 Congress could not have effected the intentions of

3

the 1871 Congress when it passed Section 1983.

4

I would also suggest that the

The second factor this Court relied upon in

5

Monell and finding municipalities to be persons were the

6

broad construction and remedial nature of Section 1983.

7

would suggest that these same principles apply to include

8

the territory within the meaning of the word person.

9

Section 1983 is to be given as broad a construction as

10

possible, and technical definitions should not be used to

11

exclude any body politic from the term person in Section

12

1983.

13

QUESTION:

14

that Section 1983 was to give

15

possible construction?

16
17

MR. SIEGEL:

Did the Court literally say in Monell
— to be

giventhe

broadest

Well, maybe that is overstating it

just a bit.

18

QUESTION:

It's a strange view, certainly.

19

on earth would you giveanything

20

construction?

21

MR. SIEGEL:

I

Why

thebroadestpossible

Well, the broadest construction

22

consistent withthe terms

used.

I think the Court's

23

intention was to not

hang the liability or applicability

24

of Section 1983 upon

some technical reading of the

25

statute.

QUESTION:

1
2

Well, the broadest possible

construction, I suppose, would include states.
MR. SIEGEL:

3

I think there is an argument to be

4

made for that.

However, in Will, and I think the

5

substance of Will is that the interest of federalism in

6

the Eleventh Amendment override that broad construction.

7

Indeed, it makes sense that Congress would not intend,

8

given the context of the act, that states would be liable

9

under — states would be persons for the purpose of

10

Section 1983 given their Eleventh Amendment immunity.

11

the petitioners would submit that that is indeed the

12

overriding considerations this Court employed in Will, in

13

holding that states were not persons, that they are given

14

a special respect and special sovereignty by the

15

Constitution and the federalist system.

16

QUESTION:

Well, — sort of a standard rule of

17

construction that if you, if you intend to include a

18

sovereign or a state you ought to say so.

19

MR. SIEGEL:

And

The rule of construction I think

20

Justice White is referring to is that person does not

21

ordinarily include the sovereign.

hard-and-fast rule, as this Court ruled in Omaha, in

23

Wilson v. The Omaha Tribes.

QUESTION:

You mean territories are just subject

7

to tort suits despite the territorial legislature saying

8

they are immune?

9

They have sovereign immunity, or what?

MR. SIEGEL:

They have sovereign immunity from

10

territorial — from acts arising on the territorial law in

11

territorial courts.

QUESTION:

MR. SIEGEL:

QUESTION:

20

Based on this Court's decision in

Polyblank that the logical and practical —

17

19

Why do they have that?

Yes, it is, Your Honor.
But you say 1983 wasn't -- didn't

have to respect that kind of immunity.
MR. SIEGEL:

I'm saying that it is illogical to

21

consider that Congress would have intended to immunize a

22

territory, which is a creature of Federal law, from an act

23

of Federal law.

24

territory itself creates the rights which flow to the

25

citizens of the territory.

The logic of Polyblank is that the

Therefore, it is immune.

That's the explicit language.
I would suggest that there, that any immunity

from the Federal law must be a matter of congressional

intent.

creations of Federal law.

QUESTION:

It's internally inconsistent.

What about our decision in District

of Columbia v. Carter?

9

of Columbia was a creature of Federal law, too, but we

10

You know, certainly the District

said that 1983 as enacted didn't cover it, didn't we?
MR. SIEGEL:

11

Because this acts on the color of -

12

— District of Columbia law were not included in -- in the

13

— in 1983 at that time, and this Court held that District

14

— properly so, that the District of Columbia is neither a

15

state or a territory.

QUESTION:

Yes.
And you think Carter would come out

differently now?

21

MR. SIEGEL:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. SIEGEL:

Yes.
Because 1983 now says territory?
I think that's some evidence,

24

although the cases obviously are not consistent in that

25

regard.

States are included in Section 1983, yet they are

The District of Columbia circuit has held

2

the District of Columbia liable under the Civil Rights

3

Act, and I think that is appropriate.

4

distinguishing factor is the Eleventh Amendment and

5

Federalism.

6

which set states apart from territories or municipalities.

I think the

I think it is the sovereignty of the states

7

And I think that can be drawn also from the

8

conclusion in Monell that Section 1983 applies to all

9

entities which are not parts of the state for Eleventh

10

Amendment purposes.

11

decisions imply that distinction, imply the Eleventh

12

Amendment as being an important factor in the

13

interpretation of Section 1983 and governmental liability.

QUESTION:

And the history of this Court's

And why aren't we bound by the

Dictionary Act definition of persons?

No, I believe this Court should be

bound by that act.

territories are not persons?

I think that the Court has taken the term

It would seem to me that, given the historical

18

context of the Civil Rights Act, that Congress would have

19

intended it to ply -- apply in territories as well, and to

20

territories.

21

slavery in the territories had been something that was

22

heatedly debated both prior to the Civil War and after it.

23

Witness the Missouri Compromise.

24

This is a reconstructionary act.

QUESTION:

On that line of reasoning they

probably would have wanted it to apply to the states as

well, in fact especially.
MR. SIEGEL:

Well, given the — given the

constitutional immunity which this Court relied on — on - in Will, I think there is ample basis for the Court's
decision in Will.
QUESTION:

That was a decision not based on

immunity, but based on the -- the perceived intent of the
Congress at the time.
MR. SIEGEL:

Right.

And I think in perceiving

that intent this Court applied two standards that apply
only to Eleventh Amendment suits, specifically that indeed
the Eleventh Amendment applies only to states, and that
Congress would have made — would have clearly expressed
its intention to alter the constitutional balance.

Now,

that balance is not at issue here.
QUESTION:

Don't you think it is much more

likely that the Reconstruction Congress would have been,
would have been more concerned about states than it would
have been — about constitutional violations by states
than it would have been about constitutional violations by
territories that are subject to the complete control of
the Federal Government?
MR. SIEGEL:

There is no question that states

were the main focus of the debates on Reconstruction.

But

I would also note that Congress would not intend to apply

3

given their powers by Congress, and there has not been one

case cited to this Court or in any brief which would

demonstrate an immunity to a claim brought under Federal

6

law with respect to a territory.

7

The territories, as I

I think the Third Circuit's reasoning in Frett,

8

in Ocasio is also appropriate for consideration.

Congress

9

would not have applied a bill of rights, and specifically

10

extended the Fourteenth and Fifth Amendments to the

11

territory, and at the same time intended to keep the

12

territories immune from actions brought pursuant to

13

Section 1983, if indeed the territories are persons.

14

By way of conclusion I would just like to add

15

perhaps a practical point, that the territory needs this

16

remedy.

17

that their civil rights are secure.

18

remedy under Section 1983 when the only person you can sue

19

is an $8.00 an hour police officer.

give the people everything that Section 1983 can give

Yes.

doesn't realize that the people need this remedy?

No.

MR. SIEGEL:
QUESTION:

What about — what about the people

of the states?
MR. SIEGEL:

I think they are in the same

position, frankly.
QUESTION:

So we should give the people in the

territory favored position as compared to the people of
the states?
MR. SIEGEL:

The states are the entities that

have the favored position.
QUESTION:

May I ask this question just to get

it straightened out in my — in states of course you have
a lot of cities you can sue, municipal corporations.

Do

we have separate municipal corporations in the territory
of Guam that are subject -MR. SIEGEL:

There are local villages, but the

only village officer is what — is a mayor, and he
essentially has no power.

They don't run any of the

police force (inaudible).
QUESTION:

The local villages or towns have

police forces, you say?
MR. SIEGEL:
QUESTION:

No, they don't.
So the only governmental entity that

has a police force that can engage in the kind of conduct
we are talking about is the territory itself?

And without an effective remedy

against an entity of such great magnitude, I suggest that

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN PATRICK MASON

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

18
19
20

MR. MASON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Whether the government of Guam is liable under

21

Section 1983 is a question of congressional intent.

22

did Congress intend concerning the territories in 1874,

23

not 1871, but 1874, when territories were added to the

24

1871 Civil Rights Act, and what did Congress intend in

25

Guam's Organic Act?

Now, Petitioners would disregard

What

1

Guam's mandate for self-government in its Organic Act, and

2

Petitioners would avoid the intent of Congress to allow

3

the people of Guam, through their duly elected

4

legislators, to balance the interests of private litigants

5

and the goals of public government.
One of the first things you can look at is the

6

7

purpose of the Civil Rights Act of 1874.

A major purpose

8

was to provide a Federal forum to enforce Fourteenth

9

Amendment rights.

Local officials in the states either

10

would not or could not grant the citizens the equal

11

protection, due processes and privileges and immunities

12

guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.

13

territories the situation is different.

However, in

And I think there is some confusion here about

14
15

the courts of the territories, because the territories had

16

Congress -- Congress established the courts in the

17

territories, and Congress -- or the President appointed

18

the judges that presided over those courts in the

19

territories.

20

consolidation of the Federal laws, the provisions common

21

to all territories, it indicates that under Federal law

22

the Congress had a Supreme Court in each territory with

23

three judges who were appointed by the President.

24

then the territories were divided into three judicial

25

districts.

In — you can see in the 1874 revision and

And

And one of those judges, then, would preside

in that judicial district.

And then the courts in those

districts would — the judges in those districts would
hold court "for the purpose of hearing and determining all
matters and cases, except those which United States is a
party."

So these were courts appointed by Congress, or

created by Congress, and these were judges appointed by
the President.

And if a 1983 action was to be brought in

the territories, it would be brought in those courts.
So, we didn't have the same situation as we had
in the states, where they needed to provide a Federal
forum.

In fact, the courts of the territories were, in

the sense that they were created for the territories by
the Federal Government with judges appointed by the
President, a Federal forum.

So that purpose really

doesn't apply in the territories as it did in the states.
QUESTION:

Let me -- let me just stop you there

for a minute.
MR. MASON:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Were there other courts besides the

courts that you have just described in the territories on
the continental — on the North American continent?

courts and probate courts, but if you look at the

MR. MASON:

That would be brought in the

district court of the territory in 1874.
QUESTION:

The ones that you have just

described?
MR. MASON:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Then why wouldn't they also be

brought in the similar courts in Guam?
MR. MASON:

Well, on Guam — okay, the situation

was on Guam, in 1950 when Congress gave Guam selfgovernment under the Organic Act, they created the
District Court of Guam, and it was the same.

That

district court had all jurisdiction, but then they allowed
the legislature of Guam to create such other courts as it
decided.
QUESTION:
MR. MASON:

Right.
And so, one year later the

legislature created well, basically the island court.

But

it -- at that point it left jurisdiction in the district
court for most felony cases and for cases — civil cases
above $2,000.

So, there again, if you had a civil rights

action at that time brought in a court of Guam it would be
brought in the district court unless it was less than
$2,000.

But, so -- but in 18 -- in 1974 then the

legislature went ahead and created the Superior Court of

2

were brought in the district court and actions under local

3

law were brought in the Superior Court of Guam.

4

appeals from this superior court still go to the District

Court of Guam before, and then to the Ninth Circuit.

6

District Court of Guam still has that jurisdiction.

7

But the

So

But in 1874, if we look at the intent of the

8

Congress when it added territories, you can see that at

9

that time — what they were trying to get at that a

10

Federal forum did exist in the territories at that time.

11

The situation on Guam that happened in 1974 didn't apply

12

to the territories at that time.

13

Another important thing, of course, in deciding

14

what the intent of Congress was is the common law

15

sovereign immunity that existed in the territories.

16

this Court has held that Congress did not intend to

17

override established common law defenses and immunities

18

without specific language to the contrary.

19

And

In 1874 the territories had an established

20

tradition of immunity from suit without its consent, and

21

this Court so held in the Kawananakoa case.

22

in that case this Court specifically rejected the argument

23

that was made that territories are like municipal

corporations.

unincorporated territories, which Guam is, in 1913 by this

Court.
Now, Petitioners argue that Kawananakoa and

There were, of course, only incorporated

Rosaly don't apply, because that means there is only

10

sovereign immunity in the local courts under local law.

11

Well, what that overlooks, of course, as I talked about a

12

minute ago, is the nature of the court system in the

13

territories.

14

courts were the local courts, although they were created

15

by Congress.

16

and that would include 19 — Section 1983 actions.

17

also, Kawananakoa was a -- the action where immunity was

held -- was upheld was actually brought in one of those

congressionally created courts, and the immunity was

upheld.

QUESTION:

What was the source of the cause of

action where immunity was upheld in that case?

remember it.

MR. MASON:

What were the courts?
No, no.

What was the cause of action

which was defeated by the —
MR. MASON:

I don't

Okay, the cause of action — or

causes of action — the Langford case was a writ of

mandate to enforce — force the county treasurer to accept

a writ in payment of taxes.

So that was a claim based on the

MR. MASON:

Yes.

I think all three -- all three

of those cases were based on territorial law.

QUESTION:

Would you claim that there would be

immunity in Guam from a suit, say, by a resident of Hawaii

for negligence committed by an agent of Guam in Hawaii?

MR. MASON:

QUESTION:

No, I don't think there would be.

QUESTION:

4

Well, no, if the action —
Or you don't claim that Guam has a

greater immunity than Nevada claimed in that case?
MR. MASON:

No, I don't think that is

5

necessarily true, no.

the jurisdiction of these courts was for all cases that

were brought in the territory.

to the territory, then they are basically a law of the

QUESTION:

Well, if your emphasis is so much on

12

the courts, I don't know if it will be possible or not,

13

but if the Plaintiff could get jurisdiction over Guam by

14

some form of process and sue them in the Federal court in

15

Hawaii — would the Hawaiian — the Federal district court

16

in Hawaii have jurisdiction over such a claim?

MR. MASON:

Well, it would depend on Guam's

immunity. I think, so it would depend —
QUESTION:

Well, then your — it doesn't seem to

me your immunity has much to do with the court in which

21

the action is brought.

22

about so much reliance on the nature of the tribunal.

MR. MASON:

That is what I — I am puzzled

The reason I am bringing up the

courts is that they claim because -- that these are --that

and therefore the common law immunity doesn't apply, the

common law immunity which was incorporated in the 1871

4

is it does apply in those very courts.

5

courts were the ones in which the Kawananakoa case was

brought.

But what we're saying
And those very

The other thing we can look at, and this is —

7
8

this is -- specifically is the definition of the word

person.

We can look at the act itself.

And I think again

10

there was some confusion because territories were not in

11

the act in 1871.

12

acting under color of state law.

13

that territories were added.

14

territories were added, that was, in that same act, was

15

when the Dictionary Act was changed.

16

from bodies corporate, or politic and corporate to

17

partnerships and corporations.

It was only prohibitions for persons
It wasn't until 1874

And in 1874, when

And it was changed

18

Therefore, in that same act -- and the reason

19

for the change was stated by the committee, was so that

20

the -- a drafter of a Federal statute would not have to

21

take care to exclude states, territories, foreign

22

governments and the like from the definition.

23

when territories are specifically added, the definition

24

under Federal law does not include territories.

25

So here,

Another indication of congressional intent in

1

both 1874, and this has to do with Guam also, is — and an

2

indication that the Federal -- the Congress is really

3

treating territories like states, was the provision that

4

was in the Organic Acts of the territories at the time.

5

And this is in the provisions common to all territories,

6

it is stated that the Constitution and all laws of the

7

United States which are not locally inapplicable, of

8

course 18 — Section 1983 had been made locally applicable

9

in 1874, those which are not locally inapplicable shall

10

have the same force and effect in the organized

11

territories as elsewhere in the United States.

12

laws were to have the same force and effect.

13

So those

Then on Guam in 1968 the Fourteenth Amendment

14

was specifically added to the Organic Act and those rights

15

that were in the Fourteenth Amendment.

16

Congress added that provision it specifically stated in

17

that same amendment the provisions, and that would include

18

those provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, shall have

the same force and effect as in the United States or in

20

any state of the United States.

same amendment all laws of Congress in the Guam

legislature inconsistent with this are repealed to the

extent of their inconsistency.

They

Now, if we — another indication, of course, is

7

the role in 1874 that the Federal Government played in

financing this -- the territories.

9

were, under the provisions common to all territories,

At that time there

10

there were direct appropriations by Congress to the

13

was even a direct appropriation, a contingency expense for

the Territory of Washington of $1,500 and of $1,000 for

15

the other territories then existing.

16

direct financial role that Congress played, it's doubtful

that they would intend to incur liability for the

So it was a suit

entitled to assert sovereign immunity as a defense to this

I would like to make three major points this

18

afternoon, other -- among those that are made in our

19

brief.

20

Guam is to be considered a person, there is direct and

21

rather conclusive evidence that the Congress that added

22

the words "or territories" to the statute in 1874 did not

23

intend to include territories within the scope of the word

24

person.

25

that states and territories be treated alike for purposes

First, with respect to the question of whether

1

of Section 1983.

2

Second, this Court has repeatedly stated that 19

3

— that Section 1983 was not intended to override well

4

accepted common law notions of immunities and defenses.

5

In 1874, in fact both in 1874 and before and after that

6

date, the idea of territorial sovereign immunity was well

7

accepted in our law.

8

expected that a territory would be liable under Section

9

1983, and under this Court's reasoning in Will and a whole

Congress would therefore not have

10

line of other cases, did not intend to make a territory

11

liable under Section 1983.
QUESTION:

12

Mr. Feldman, is there any significant

13

difference between incorporated territories and

14

unincorporated territories?

15

MR. FELDMAN:

No, I don't believe there is.

For

16

one thing, in 1874 when this Congress acted, there was no

17

such distinction in the law.

18

distinction came into the law just after the turn of the

19

century, it was primarily for purposes of determining

20

which constitutional rights apply to a territory.

21

not for purposes of determining whether sovereign immunity

22

applied to a territory.

23

already been pointed out, when the Court reached those

24

issues in the Hawaii case, Hawaii was an incorporated

25

territory,

But, in any event, when that

It was

And, indeed, when — as has

I believe at the time, and the Court held that

it was entitled to the sovereign immunity.

2

Court reached it in Puerto Rico, which was not an

3

incorporated territory, the Court held the same thing.
QUESTION:

4

And when the

Would your position on whether the

5

territory is a person be the same in the case of the

6

Northern Marianas?

7

MR. FELDMAN:

I think, as a general matter, the

8

arguments that we have advanced in support of Guam's

9

immunity in this case would apply to the other

10

territories, if it is a self-governing entity.

11

QUESTION:

How about the District of Columbia?

12

MR. FELDMAN:

The District of Columbia is a bit

13

more difficult a case for a number of reasons.

First, the

14

District — the statute, as it reads now, includes states,

15

territories and the District of Columbia.

16

territories are categories of entities, but the District

17

of Columbia is an individual unit.

18

them.

19

Columbia after all does have a sui generis quality.

20

in any event, the relevant congressional intent with

21

respect to the District of Columbia was that of the 1979

22

Congress that added the District of Columbia to the

23

statute.

24

different legal environment than were the Reconstruction

25

Congresses in the 1870s.

Now, states and

There is only one of

And that possibly may indicate that the District of
But

And that Congress was acting in a rather

Therefore, in short, I don't -- I think you

1
—

2

would have to look specifically at that action to

3

determine the status of the District of Columbia.

4

insofar as the District of Columbia is a fully self-

5

governing entity, and Congress intended to make it such, I

6

think many of our arguments would apply to the District of

7

Columbia.

8
9

2S

But

It -- my third point — well, my third point I
wanted to make today was that with respect to sovereign

10

immunity issues, there is no substantial dispute that Guam

11

is, as a general matter, entitled to assert sovereign

12

Well, Mr. Feldman, if the — if Guam

is not a person under the meaning of Section 1983, do we

have to go further and deal with sovereign immunity?

MR. FELDMAN:

No, I would -- you don't -- I

8

would suggest you don't.

It really — the sovereign

immunity issue arises — was not passed on by the court of

10

appeals, and arises only if the Court were to determine,

11

contrary to our argument, that Guam were a person.

10

There is no indication of any contrary congressional

the Court did, the evidence that Congress intended states

2

and territories to be treated the same for this statute,

3

and in fact that the Court had in the past and has in the

4

past treated territories and states as a general matter of

common law sovereign immunity in identical fashion, would

6

suggest that the same result should be reached here as was

7

reached in the Will state -- Will case.
It would be odd to say that the Congress that

8

9

was interested in protecting civil rights in the southern

10

states in the 1870s intended that Section 1983 apply with

11

greater force to territories than to states, when the

12

addition of territories to the statute was, after all,

13

just an afterthought on Congress' part, made three years

14

later, and was not -- the focus of Congress's intention,

15

of course, at that time was on enforcement of

16

constitutional rights in the states.

17

With respect to the sovereign immunity issue, if

18

the Court were to reach it, the — I don't think, in

19

response to Justice Stevens' question before, that Nevada

20

v. Hall establishes that Guam could not — that Guam

21

sovereign immunity should not be recognized.

22

Hall recognized the long tradition of comity, and

recognized that the general rule is that sovereign

immunity would be recognized in the courts of a different

sovereign.

And therefore it could waive it.

has waived its sovereign immunity for some purposes, as

was pointed out, and Guam could waive its — might waive
