ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. WESTON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
These three consolidated cases present various

13

challenges to this Dallas licensing ordinance.

14

Petitioners and the M.J.R. Petitioners, bookstores, motion

15

picture theaters, arcades, cabarets, attack the ordinance on

16

various First Amendment grounds arising from their

17

communicative activities.

18

The FW/PBS

The Calvin Berry, III Petitioners, motels, are included

19

within the scope of the ordinance solely because they provide

20

room rentals for periods of less than 10 hours.

21

different challenge, the absence of any justification for

22

including them within the ordinance.

23

will turn to the Berry matter first.

24
25

They assert a

If the Court please, I

Under the ordinance, hotels or others providing rooms
for rent for less than 10 hours are qualified, or are included

as sexually oriented businesses.

And also under the ordinance

no one may rent rooms for less than 10 hours unless they have

license under the ordinance.

applies not only to Petitioners' hotels, but also to the

5

Hilton, to Holiday Inn, the Sheraton, as well as other hotels

6

and motels which provide accommodations for those in the

7

airline industry and truckers and others on travel-sensitive

8

and short schedules.

On its face, this legislation

9

Given the lack of any reference whatsoever in this

10

record or in the entire legislative process to short-term

11

rental establishments, Petitioners respectfully assert that

12

the scheme as to them is over inclusive and irrational, and is

13

violative of equal protection and due process of the laws.

14
15
16

And if the Court please, I will now turn to the
arguments of the other two Petitioners.
Respondents invite this Court to make radical and

17

wholesale reductions in the most basic protections of the

18

First Amendment which have traditionally safeguarded

19

expression in this country.

20

ordinance by several quite remarkable propositions, including

21

their statement that under the ordinance no religious or

22

political discourse would be restrained.

23

their argument extends to that if speech does not contain a

24

component of religious or political discourse, it is then

25

subject to lesser and perhaps ultimately no First Amendment

They attempt to justify their

I suppose, fairly,

protection.

2

If the First Amendment is to have any continuing long-

3

or short-term validity, Respondents arguments must be

resoundingly rejected.

This Court has consistently held over a long, long
period of time —

QUESTION:

MR. WESTON:

9
10

Would you accept a grudging rejection?
If I can't get a resounding rejection I

would accept a grudging one, Justice Scalia, as long as it is
unequivocal.

11

This Court has held over a long, long period of time

12

that any laws requiring, as a precondition to the engaging in

13

speech, licenses —

14

QUESTION:

Well, these — these people are not,

15

strictly speaking, engaged in speech.

16

aren't they?

MR. WESTON:

They are selling stuff,

Well, I think that's -- that's true, Your

18

Honor.

19

expression, but this Court has continually held that the fact

20

that there was a charge attendant to expression itself,

21

whether it be in the context of the sale of a newspaper or the

22

sale of a book or the selling of an admission ticket for a

23

ballet dance or for theater, certainly was no indication —

24
25

There is — certainly consideration charged for the

speech, but these — these people are engaged in a commercial

business.

3

people the same way it requires the licensing of other people,

4

for purposes of collecting a sales tax —

5

Can't -- can't a state require a license of these

Well, of course, Mr. Chief Justice.

Our

point is not that a license per se is impermissible.

course not.

9

a prior restraint in the beginning.

Of

But rather that any license of this nature must

QUESTION:

11

MR. WESTON:

Well, why -- why is it a prior restraint?
Because without the license one may not

12

engage in the speech.

13

-in summarizing its decisions on prior restraint, that a prior

14

restraint is classically that circumstance where government

15

can deny or does deny a form in advance of expression.

16

may not engage in the speech until one has a license.

17

not obtain -- one does not get the license simply on paying

18

the filing fee and paying — and paying one's money and filing

19

the application.

QUESTION:

21

a prior restraint?

22

MR. WESTON:

And as this Court recently noted, its -

So requiring a permit for a parade, then, is

Is a classical prior restraint, although

23

it may be an adequate and a valid prior restraint.

As the

24

Chief Justice well knows, not all prior restraints are

25

invalid.

They simply start off requiring the extremely heavy

1

scrutiny of this or any constitutional court, and they come to

2

this Court or any other court with a heavy presumption against

3

their invalidity.

4

That is the only point that we make.

And because the governmental power inherent in these

5

prior restraints is so extraordinary, a set of rules involving

6

strict scrutiny has of course been set up to ensure that

7

government does not, intentionally or unintentionally, abuse

8

the extraordinary power which these devices give them.

9

QUESTION:

And you take the position that commercial

10

sales of sexually explicit speech are entitled to exactly the

11

same protection as, for example, a political rally.

12

MR. WESTON:

We take the position that there is no

13

justification, Justice O'Connor, for creating any sort of

14

hierarchy for speech under our constitutional framework.

15

certainly think that there is nothing that indicates that the

16

founders or the framers had any such concept.

17

justification for doing so, and quite frankly, the response I

18

guess to the implied question might well be why, and followed

19

by what next.

20

diminishes ultimately the value of all speech.

21

respectfully submit —

QUESTION:

25

We

We see no

The establishment of any hierarchy of speech

Well, how about commercial speech.

Do you

think that gets the same protection as political speech?
MR. WESTON:

Well, the Court obviously has wrestled

with the question of —

QUESTION:

1
2

Do you think our cases would support the

position that they are entitled to the same protection?

3

MR. WESTON:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. WESTON:

No, I think that —
Well, then there is some hierarchy.
No.

I think that generically the Court

6

certainly has indicated that at least commercial speech, in

7

some circumstances, is not entitled to the same speech, but I

8

think —

9

QUESTION:
MR. WESTON:

10

Is this at least commercial speech?
No, Your Honor, this would not qualify as

11

commercial speech any more than the sale of a book, the sale

12

of a newspaper, the sale of a ticket to a rock concert or

13

whatever.

14

which is to be construed and viewed exactly in that context,

15

separate from the commercial, commerciality of the message,

16

which lends the potentially second-class status to commercial

17

speech.

18

This speech is, in essence, speech or pure speech,

The point I was going to make, Justice Stevens, is

19

simply that the aspects of commercial speech seem really to be

20

more akin almost to a time, place and manner circumstance with

21

respect to it, rather than the content of the message of the

22

commercial speech.

23

QUESTION:

What about obscene speech?

24

that a separate category?

25

MR. WESTON:

Is that a -- is

1

least up until the present a continuing majority of this Court

2

has held that obscene speech is simply expression, but not

3

speech in the First Amendment sense.

4
5

QUESTION:

Well, you can call it not speech, but it's

speech, isn't it?

6

MR. WESTON:

7

QUESTION:

Well, with all respect -I mean, let's not play games.

We have

8

established a separate category of speech, obscene speech, to

9

which we accord no protection, zero.

10

MR. WESTON:

Right?

Again, not wishing to play games at all,

11

but this Court's decisions have made clear that, for purposes

12

of the First Amendment, obscenity is not speech.

13

expression, but it is not speech.

14

entitled, after determinations of obscenity, that it is

15

nonspeech, to any of the protections.

16

may be destroyed.

17

protected quality which the expression in this case manifestly

18

retains, because this material is not alleged to be obscene,

19

and the standard for judging it or identifying it —

20

QUESTION:

It is

And therefore, it is not

It may be seized, it

It simply offers none of the incidence of

Well, but if we can say that there is a

21

separate category of speech which is not speech, as we have

22

done in obscenity, I suppose we could say there is a separate

23

category of speech which is only partly protected speech, as

24

we have already done in commercial speech.

25

MR. WESTON:

Well, again —

QUESTION:

And indeed haven't we done that with respect

2

to pornography, something just short of obscenity.

permissible with respect to —

MR. WESTON:

Haven't we

But not on the basis -- well, obviously.

Perhaps we should define terms.

expression which has been determined to be beyond the pale of

the First Amendment; it is nonspeech.

purpose or its offered role or why it is being done in -- in

connection with any analysis that may be provided.

It is more its

It really

With respect to pornography, sexually oriented speech,

16

I am not aware of any majority holding of this Court which, on

17

the basis of its being sexually oriented speech, has concluded

18

that it is entitled to less protection.

19

of what I respectfully call some tentative forays in that

20

direction, but I do not believe, and I — I feel quite certain

21

in saying, that there has been no such ruling on the part of

22

this Court.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. WESTON:

25

Certainly, I am aware

What about defamatory speech?
Defamatory speech typically has also been

considered to be speech which is simply beyond the pale -11

QUESTION:

1

Well, that is not correct; just a different

2

burden when it is against a public figure and that sort of

3

thing.

4

is a form of speech.

5

There are different rules applied to defamatory speech

MR. WESTON:

Well, I think that is fair.

But again,

6

defamatory speech is subject to whatever restraints or

7

whatever inhibitions only after a determination that it falls

8

into this quasi or this specifically unprotected category.

9

QUESTION:

Yes, but we're talking about speech that you

10

would only say has been entitled to less protection if one can

11

so conclude after determining it was sexually oriented speech.

12

You make that determination before you say it gets less

13

protection.

14

MR. WESTON:

I -- I think there would not be a problem

15

determining that speech were sexually oriented.

16

problem would then be in terms of, at least with respect to

17

that aspect of it, exactly how broad the category would be.

18

Because if one, for example takes a look at the definitional

19

language in this ordinance, it makes very, very clear that

20

even verbal descriptions of sexual activity bring material

21

within the category under the ordinance.

22

I think the

I suspect that this would include Ulysses, and the

23

extraordinary James Joyce depictions of a very explicit sex in

24

the Molly Bloom soliloquy, as well as it would contain

25

Harlequin dime store novels which deal extensively, and if not

The ordinance does not ban any material

It just says that if a person is engaged in a

Well, interestingly, Justice Scalia, the

ordinance says that only with respect to bookstores, and that

11

may well be why the city in its brief discussed bookstores

14

it's clear that the dissemination of even one film with a

For example, with respect to arcades,

Well, wait.

What kind of Plaintiffs do we

Do we have arcade Plaintiffs —

MR. WESTON:

Yes, we have arcades, we have bookstores,

19

we have theaters, we have adult cabarets, we have a -- a

rather broad array.

21

QUESTION:

Do these Plaintiffs include all of the kinds

22

of businesses covered by the ordinance?

23

that.

MR. WESTON:

No, no, Your Honor.

MR. WESTON:

No, I think that it would have to be

MR. WESTON:

QUESTION:

The —
It is the case that no material is — is —

12

prevented from being sold.

13

MR. WESTON:

Well, on the face it may appear that way,

14

but it is very unclear as to what, in the literal language of

15

the ordinance, is a — a principal business purpose, in terms

16

of what exact -- as opposed to primary -- and that may make --

17

I'm not trying to split hairs, that may make some semantical

18

difference, because the term is -- and a practical difference.

19

The term is simply not defined anywhere in the ordinance.

20

But — I — what — the notion clearly is, is that

21

under the Dallas ordinance one may not disseminate the speech

22

one has chosen to disseminate, absent obtaining a permit.

23

only way, under the implication in — in Your Honor's

24

question, that one may do so, is by agreeing to or choosing to

25

disseminate other speech which would — which one would not

2

in order to qualify under the ordinance.

3

So, given that one could not justify the ordinance by

4

requiring one to carry speech which otherwise one would not,

5

Riley, Terminiello, one would think that in a real sense,

6

Justice Scalia, this piece of legislation does in fact impose

7

a total prior restraint in the City of Dallas on the ability

8

of one to disseminate the speech one chooses in the absence of

9

obtaining the permit.

10

QUESTION:

Actually you don't have to do other speech

11

in order to fall out of the a primary purpose of which.

Really?
Because one would — well, I suppose

Sure you could.
Unless —
You don't have to sell, the state in order -

20

- in order for you to avoid the licensing scheme, the state is

21

not requiring you to -- to promulgate other speech, so long as

you have other business which makes the sale of the sexually

explicit material not a primary purpose.

Kleenex, or "Kleenices" and at the same time have one's entire

2

other selection be sexually oriented expression, and

3

conceivably, and again we don't know how the legislation will

4

be dealt with, but of course the point would be what is one's

principal business purpose.

6

be the sexually oriented material, notwithstanding the acres

7

and acres of shelves of Kleenex boxes, apparently the

8

ordinance would still require qualification.

And if the purpose was deemed to

9

In my experience with these kinds of ordinances around

10

the country, and it now spans more years than I would like to

11

admit -- these definitional aspects are expanded consistently

12

to deal with whatever attempts are made by businesses to

13

exempt themselves from the scope of the — of the legislation.

14

And so we would conclude, with respect to this portion,

15

by simply noting that in a fair and principled sense this

16

legislation is indeed a prior restraint.

believe the critical issue in this case is whether the city

has a justification for the licensing provisions in the

than necessary to achieve the city's purpose.

Yes, it does.

One other point.

If someone is living or

MRS. MUNCY:

Yes, it is.

the Freedman procedural safeguards apply to the licensing

portion of the ordinance.

12

QUESTION:

In response to the issue on —

Could you — I — I — I didn't quite

13

realize what Justice Kennedy just pointed out.

14

that if somebody, say in a family, one member of the family,

15

worked in a bookstore and got sometimes convicted of selling

16

one obscene magazine, then everybody who lives in that family

17

could be disqualified from — in that home, would be

18

disqualified from getting a license?

19

MRS. MUNCY:

No.

Does this mean

What it means is that if a person is,

20

owns or operates or is the applicant or licensee for a

21

sexually oriented business is convicted of one of the offenses

22

that disqualifies, then that person's spouse or a person

23

residing with that person cannot become the applicant or the

24

licensee for that -- for that business, or for a similar

25

sexually oriented business in the city.

You say we have people who have been convicted.

To my knowledge, none of the Petitioners

provisions.

QUESTION:
MRS. MUNCY:

So, maybe that provision is not before us.
It is possible.
That goes back to my question.

QUESTION:

He'd still be disqualified?

I would -- yes, he would, but that is

Since we are getting into this matter,

18

counsel, I — I — I think there are two different provisions.

1

One is, is that there is a disqualification if a spouse has

20

been convicted of a crime.

21

if someone is residing with an applicant and that person has

22

been denied a license.

think your case is slightly stronger than it sounds, unless I

am misreading the ordinance.

MRS. MUNCY:

The second is a disqualification

That is correct.

QUESTION:

1

So the only — the only nonspousal

disabilities are for persons who are residing with the

applicant, if those persons themselves have been denied a

license.

Is that not correct?

5

MRS. MUNCY:

QUESTION:

7

MRS. MUNCY:

8

QUESTION:

9

That is correct, that is exactly correct.
Thank you.
Yes, thank you.

But --

Which explanation is quite apparent.

Its

purpose is to prevent the evasion of the provision by simply

10

when you are denied a — a license, getting it granted to

11

someone else who is closely related to you, and you are the

12

actual person running the business.

13
14

MRS. MUNCY:

That is exactly the purpose of the

provision, yes.

15

But, getting to the individual whose license is denied

16

or revoked because of a criminal provision, the first point I

17

want to make on that is that the First Amendment rights of

18

consumers is in no way — no way affected by that provision.

19

These people are -- intermediaries who are purveying the

20

messages of others.

operate that business.

fierce.

And again, the distributors, the national distributors

of this material which are represented by the attorneys here

the result of this provision will make sure that these

national companies that distribute this material will be

motivated to find responsible people to operate the businesses

expressed the importance of availability of the material to

3

The second point that I want to make is that the only

conceivable First Amendment interest that I think one can

really be concerned about is that of the individual whose

First Amendment interest at best because it has absolutely

MRS. MUNCY:

That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice, but

It

I think, given the legitimate and substantial interest

11

that the city has that led to the passage of this ordinance,

the city's position is that the minimal incidental burden that

it places on the individual's right is more than outweighed by

the city's substantial interest.

QUESTION:

Petitioners argued —

that are needed, isn't that right?
MRS. MUNCY:

Yes.

Petitioners argued in their reply

brief that that was — could be used as a delaying tactic.

14

But let me say, the way the ordinance is administered, when an

15

applicant puts in his application he is given the telephone

16

numbers of the inspectors, he is told to call them, set up an

17

appointment for when he will be there to allow the inspectors

18

to inspect the business, and every effort is made to get

19

everything done within 30 days.

QUESTION:

If —

I suppose that if that is bad anyway it is

bad because the fire licensing ordinance is bad.

say, even without this ordinance, if you didn't issue a fire

to the inspection provisions, because much has been made of

that, under the Dallas development code every — every

business is required to get a Certificate of Occupancy when it

No, we do not.

It is the same for —

I can't answer for other Texas cities.

For just a — a moment, let me comment on some of the

arguments that counsel made.

So I believe that the Court can apply the O'Brien

standard, and it's our position that -- that the provisions of

this ordinance pass muster very easily under that intermediate

level of First Amendment analysis.

QUESTION:

May I ask one question about the findings

that the city made to justify the ordinance?

was an increase of crime in the areas where these business

Does that mean there was an increase in sex-

You said there

The studies that are conducted by the

other cities generally found the increase was in sex-related

MRS. MUNCY:

QUESTION:

Yes, assaults —

MRS. MUNCY:

It is only for sex-related crimes, and the

10

lower — we had other crimes serving as disqualifications and

11

the district court found that those were not sufficiently

12

related to the licensing purpose, and so we removed those

13

other crimes from the ordinance before it was appealed to the

14

Fifth Circuit.

15

The licensing provisions of the Dallas ordinance have

16

considerably less direct impact on the First Amendment rights

of these individuals than do the location requirements in the

ordinance, but they are equally important to the city's crime
