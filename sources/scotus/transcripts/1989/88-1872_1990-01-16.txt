CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

of Illinois, and a companion case.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY LEE LEAHY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS/CROSS-RESPONDENTS
MRS. LEAHY:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The complaint in this case alleges that the

11
12

Governor's Office of Personnel controls the filling of all

13

employment positions in departments and agencies under the

14

jurisdiction of the Governor -- that is, promotions,

15

transfers, recalls from layoff and actual hire.

16

affiliation is the decisive factor in filling these

17

positions.

18

uses the county Republican parties.

Political

In making its decision, the Governor's office

The applicant -- and by applicant I am including

19
20

not just someone applying for hire, but applicant for

21

promotion, transfer, recall from layoff -- the applicant

22

voting record in the primary is reviewed, as are

23

contributions to the party and actual support of the

24

party.

QUESTION:

service system?

MRS. LEAHY:

3

QUESTION:

4

That is correct, Your Honor.
And it was -- there was an executive

order —
MRS. LEAHY:

5

That is correct, Your Honor.

In 19

8

QUESTION:

— that imposed a hiring freeze back

in 1980?
MRS. LEAHY:

9
10

QUESTION:

11

MRS. LEAHY:

12

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.
And is that freeze still in effect?
Yes, Your Honor.
And did the freeze in effect impose a

13

new system of determining promotions and transfers and

14

hires?

15
16
17
18
19

MRS. LEAHY:

Your Honor, I believe that this —

yes, a new system imposed on the civil service system.
QUESTION:

Because the freeze, the text of the

freeze just said we won't have any more hiring.
MRS. LEAHY:

Unless I approve it, or someone

20

that I delegate that authority to approves it.

That was

21

the gist of the Governor's executive order.

22

exactly what has happened.

23

filling of any of these positions has been delegated to

24

the Governor's Office of Personnel, and they decide the

25

filling of these positions.

And that is

Their power to approve the

QUESTION:

1

And had the civil service system been

2

in effect, there would not -- you wouldn't be here.

3

would operate to disregard these considerations that you

4

say are used now?
MRS. LEAHY:

5

It

Your Honor, we believe, and we

6

quoted in our brief, certain appellate court rulings in

7

Illinois that talked about the purpose of the civil

8

service system.

9

as we believe it ought to, no, we would not be here,

We believe that had that been operating

10

because these constitutional issues would not have been

11

raised.
QUESTION:

12

Do you know how many states do not

13

have a civil service system now for nonpolicy-making

14

employees?

15

MRS. LEAHY:

No, Your Honor, I do not know the

16

precise number.

17

We have looked at certain states.

18

The overwhelming majority do, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Just to be clear, the civil service

19

system just had the Governor's order superimposed upon it.

20

It was not suspended?

21

MRS. LEAHY:

22

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.
So that for the plaintiffs here, the

23

civil service system was still operating in that it had

24

examinations and it had a list of qualified people?

25

MRS. LEAHY:

That is correct, Your Honor, but

the decision now is made by the Governor's Office of

Office of Personnel, they do not even get in that pool to

Taylor should have received the promotion had the civil

service system been working, because they were more

9

gualified than the people who did receive those

And as we point out, unless the form, which is

As we have alleged, both Ms. Rutan and Mr.

10

But without that sponsorship they do not get

11

in the pool to be considered.

12

QUESTION:

13

MRS. LEAHY:

Well, how about new employees?
That is the same thing, Your Honor.

14

Representative Winchester wrote to Petitioner Moore, who

15

was trying to get a job in the Department of Corrections,

16

and he said you have to get the endorsement of the county

17

party before your name can be referred to the Governor's

18

Office.

19

QUESTION:

Are there any new hires or potential

20

new hires who are parties to this action, people who are

21

not already in state employment?

22

MRS. LEAHY:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

Yes, Your Honor, Petitioner Moore.
He had never been employed by the

state before?
MRS. LEAHY:

That is correct, Your Honor.

He

1

was seeking positions within the Department of

2

Corrections.

3

QUESTION:

And your contention is that we should

4

expand our rulings in Branti and Elrod, to extend them to

5

the hiring process?

6

MRS. LEAHY:

Your Honor, I'm not sure I would

7

use the word extend, but I am asking the Court to apply

8

those same principles of law, yes, Your Honor.

9
10

QUESTION:
MRS. LEAHY:

To the hiring.
Your Honor, I believe that this

11

Court has not made any distinction in applicants' First

12

Amendment rights in other contexts.

13

v. Watkins.

14

QUESTION:

For example, Torcaso

But in Branti and Elrod, the opinions

15

point out in both cases that those people were already

16

within the government employment system, didn't they?

17

MRS. LEAHY:

Yes, Your Honor, that is correct.

18

But I think the only thing that the Court could decide

19

were the facts that were before the Court at that time,

20

and those were discharges.

21

Your Honor, that is precisely the question that

22

is before this Court, as to whether those factors that

23

were constitutionally impermissible in Branti and Elrod

24

are constitutionally impermissible in the benefits of

25

employment we are talking about here.

1

The Seventh Circuit held that those claiming

2

recall from layoff, that they were not recalled from

3

layoff when they should have been due to their political

4

affiliation, should be remanded under Elrod and Branti.

5

The court then held that as to Petitioners Rutan and

6

Taylor, their denial of promotion and denial of transfer

7

should be remanded to see if it reached the level of

8

constructive discharge.

9

there was no cause of action whatsoever for the man

10

And then the court outright held

seeking the job.

11

We have approached this case in the traditional

12

First Amendment analysis, and the respondents have failed

13

to do that.

14

to point out a few things that I think are important.

15

first is that there is no dispute that a person has the

16

right not to affiliate with a particular party and has the

17

right not to support a particular candidate or to support

18

particular beliefs under the First Amendment, that that is

19

protected activity.

20

Before going into that analysis, I would like
The

There also has been no suggestion at any point

21

along the way that the jobs in question in this case fall

22

under Branti, that is, the confidential policy making

23

exception which was first talked about in Elrod and then

24

further delineated in Branti.

Your Honor, I am beginning with

your premise that it is important to have a stable two-

4

MRS. LEAHY:

I -- I'm not sure about that.

Your Honor, that is why I said I

accepted the premise that it is the two-party system.

6

This system is not designed to promote that.

7

designed to preserve and increase the strength of the

8

incumbent party.

QUESTION:

It is

Well, but the two-party system

10

suggests the outs will get their turn and they will do the

11

has to be.

the two-party system, then you have to move to the third

prong of the First Amendment analysis, which is -QUESTION:

4

compelling interest protecting the two-party system?

5

MRS. LEAHY:

6

the stable two-party system is.
QUESTION:

7

Yes, Your Honor, I think protecting
I would point out —

And so then on the first prong of the

8

analysis it is just a question of whether or not we agree

9

with your characterization that it helps out one party

10

only.

11

it helps both parties, or helps preserve the two-party

12

system, then there is a compelling state interest.

13

Correct?

14

Because if we — if we disagree with that and say

MRS. LEAHY:

No, Your Honor.

I think I

15

misunderstood your question.

I think then you would have

16

to look at whether or not in those states which have civil

17

service protection and do not take political factors into

18

consideration in hiring, you would have to look there to

19

see if there has been any effect on the two-party system.

20

I don't believe that the Federal system, or those states

21

that have a true civil service system in hiring, that the

22

two-party system has been damaged in any way.

23

submit that this system — the flip side of the coin can

24

be that this system so turns people off from participation

25

in political activity that it damages that system.

I would

Take a person who comes out of college with a

2

degree in sociology and wants to be a case worker in the

3

Department of Children and Family Services, and then finds

4

out that this is the system by which he will get that job.

5

I think that could damage political participation as much

6

or more than any type of promotion of the system that has

7

gotten by hiring those who are politically favored.

that comparison was only done at the third stage of that

4

And that was when you were looking at the remedy to be

6

this Court.

7

the Court admitted that both were intrusive, firing and

8

the hiring, but the Court found one to be less intrusive.

9

But that was at the remedy stage, Your Honor.

I think there was an uncomfortable choice before

Do you think we would make a

17

That wouldn't involve remedy.

MRS. LEAHY:

I think it then would depend on the

18

purpose of the affirmative action program, because the

19

affirmative action program is to remedy a prior wrong.

QUESTION:

Do you think we would treat an

MRS. LEAHY:

But, Your Honor, I would submit

that if you go to the Federal Government and you go to

without considering these factors, the party has not been

any different in that regard.

It is clear that there are no

could be for candidates as opposed to the party itself.
QUESTION:

2

Is there something in the record that

indicates the party did look into that sort of a thing,

whether you were opposed to one faction of the party?
MRS. LEAHY:

5

Your Honor, the complaint alleges

6

that the contributions, the financial support to

7

candidates or to the party is taken into consideration.

8

As to whether — there is nothing in the record as to a

9

particular person, there was a primary battle that

contributions were made to one and not to the other.

QUESTION:

But with respect to the individuals

involved here, aren't the allegations that each of them

It's not the point that this is not a

partisan, I mean, even taking into account the friendship,

9

it seems to me it's still a very partisan thing.

doesn't help you to be a friend of a Democrat, does it?

engender activity and support in the two parties, to have

increased participation in the political process, an

8

incentive to those employees to do well who have supported

9

the party, and to provide good representatives of the

QUESTION:

Don't you think that interest can be

12

served by the partisan appointment that goes on for

13

policy-making employees?

14

MR. SULLIVAN:

Well, Your Honor, in many

15

respects the people who are in the jobs that are lower

16

than the policy making are the ones who the public deals

17

with, and that — those are the ones that have the

18

interaction with the public and who the incumbent

19

administration will be judged by.

20

it seems to us, that the incumbent administration would

21

want to have persons who support them rather than their
