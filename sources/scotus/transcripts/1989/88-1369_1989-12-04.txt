ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS M. SWEENEY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. SWEENEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether police

12

officers possessing an — a arrest warrant for an armed

13

robbery suspect may, at the time of the arrest of the

14

suspect in his home, make a brief security check of the

15

premises to determine if other persons are present.

16

Maryland Court of Appeals decided that the state must show

17

that there is probable cause to believe that a serious and

18

demonstrable potentiality for danger exists to justify a

19

safety check in this type of situation.

20

The

Finding the probable cause for a safety check

21

did not exist in this case.

It held that a red running

22

suit seized by one of the officers during the security

23

check should have been suppressed.

24

ordered, setting aside Mr. Buie's 35-year sentence for

25

armed robbery and use of a handgun in the commission of a

felony.
The state asserts that safety checks of homes at

3

the time of arrest, under the authority of an arrest

4

warrant, should be analyzed under the general

5

reasonableness balancing test.

6

balancing of Mr. Buie's minimal privacy interest affected

7

by the safety check against the compelling need to

8

preserve the safety of officers and others at the arrest

9

scene, is best met by establishing a bright-line rule, a

Applying this test, the

10

single, workable standard authorizing a brief and limited

11

check of the home, without any need for objective

12

justification in each case.

15

QUESTION:

Now, the Solicitor General suggests a

test that may differ from that which you are suggesting.
MR. SWEENEY:

That is correct.

We argue that

16

also in the alternative, the reasonable suspicion test.

17

We, however, believe that this is best served by a

18

categorical rule, a bright-line rule which would authorize

19

such checks in every situation of an in-home arrest for a

20

dangerous crime.

As a practical matter, what is the

police practice on in-home arrests?

Court's decision in Chimel, there have been legions of

2

cases which have been collected by both parties and which

3

have been analyzed in the law reviews, which indicate that

4

this is a very common police practice, indeed a police

5

rubric, after an arrest to conduct a limited sweep of the

premises to determine if other individuals are on the

7

premises.

the 12 federal circuits, by 33 state courts, as prudent

police conduct.

This type of procedure has been recognized by

QUESTION:

10

In this case, was there sufficient

11

basis on which the officers could have obtained a search

12

warrant at the same time they got the arrest warrant?

13

MR. SWEENEY:

If the officers, at the time they

14

obtained the arrest warrant, if there was a standard that

15

required a warrant in such situations, we believe that a

16

warrant could have been obtained, but that is -- in a

17

sense backs right into our bright-line rule.

18

is our contention, that every arrest for a dangerous crime

19

is the type of situation that requires a safety check to

20

be made.

MR. SWEENEY:

I believe the, the best bright-

line rule would provide that if the officers do not need

3

to cross the threshold of the home —

Supposing he is ten feet — say he is

in the hallway with his coat and hat on, and — what does

the bright-line rule provide then?

The bright-line rule provides that

they would if he is ten feet inside the house —

What if he answered the door and says

to this Court is not just the safety of the officers, but

2

the safety of others at the arrest scene.

3

officers make the determination, they don't — this —

4

they do not have to do a protective sweep of the house,

house if the situation, in their judgment, requires it for

their safety or the safety of others.

are now saying if in their judgment it requires it.

Right.

Which would mean here they

could search, even if their judgment wasn't that it

required it, but they thought well, if we go through the

would be useful.

MR. SWEENEY:

Well, it's an objective test.

Right.

And I mean, there is nothing

wrong with that if the rule authorizes it, it is perfectly

all right to take a look.

It's an objective — it's an

conduct the sweep of the premises.
QUESTION:

Well, I am sure the police chief

would say make it standard operating procedure.

Do you expand the -- do you expand

the reason that you urge for making the sweep for persons

to make sure that there is no person around that might

MR. SWEENEY:

That is not this case.

Obviously,

if the officers see someone who is destroying evidence, or

2

You mean to tell me that everybody

parts of the house when you have an arrest warrant and you

MR. SWEENEY:

6

A — those decisions have read it

7

when there is a search for evidence, that is where Chimel

8

is read to go beyond the wingspan area, to prevent those

type of searches.
There has been — Chimel is very interesting

because that is when you begin to see the protective sweep

12

cases.

13

from the 12 circuits, 33 state courts, all recognizing

14

that protective sweeps are prudent police conduct.

15

a natural outgrowth of the Chimel case that, because it

1

QUESTION:

Why do you need that?

2

MR. SWEENEY:

Well, because an individual may be

3

on the fourth floor, may be down in the basement, may be

4

anywhere in that house, who could present a danger to the

5

officers.

In this case --

6

QUESTION:

MR. SWEENEY:

officers had the reassurance --

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. SWEENEY:

Well, if he — if the police

If you don't go up there.
Well, that is, that -- you know,

12

there are many judgments that, regarding police practice

13

or police procedure, that can be -- can be -- alternatives

14

can be considered, police judgments can be second guessed.

15

I think one of the things these, this Court's decision

16

teaches, for example in Pennsylvania v. Mimms, about the

17

bright-line rule for individuals to leave the vehicle if

18

the officer requests it at the scene, is that, while that

19

is a very acceptable police practice, the dissent notes

20

that some police manuals counsel the exact opposite of

21

that procedure.

22

So simply the fact that there may be an

23

alternative procedure is not the type of thing, as this

24

Court said in United States v. Sharpe, that courts should

25

get into second-guessing officer practices.

That requires entry into a home.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. SWEENEY:

It is closer than the fourth floor.
It may be closer than the fourth

floor, but one of the things this Court's decisions have

13

said over and over again is there shall be no breach of

result of the arrest warrant.

Right.

And if you haven't got

14

MR. SWEENEY:

Well, if you are lawfully on the

the premises and inside of the house, then the concerns

17

that this Court has enunciated regarding the breaching of

You mention that one of the purposes

for the sweep search is to protect the safety of others?

MR. SWEENEY:

QUESTION:

9

Yes.

How does that work?

Give me an

example.
MR. SWEENEY:

10

I'll give you an example from this

11

case.

There were two girls who were immediately outside

12

the door of the house who could have been in danger if

13

there had been an attack on the officers as the officers

14

were leaving the scene.

17

QUESTION:

They could have been in the line

Well, that is substantially the same

as protecting the officers.

18

MR. SWEENEY:

19

QUESTION:

I am sorry?

That is substantially the same as —

20

the rationale is to protect the officers from an ambush or

21

an attack?

22

MR. SWEENEY:

An ambush or an attack, to protect

23

the officers, to protect others at the scene, to protect

24

the arrestee himself.

QUESTION:

Just from an ambush or an attack?

That not only — not on the basis

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE S. ROBBINS

12

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

13

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

14
15
16

MR. ROBBINS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The Maryland Court of Appeals, in our view, got

17

off to the right start in this case.

It explained

18

correctly that in deciding what legal standard to apply to

19

a protective sweep a court must consider the objective

20

expectation of privacy that may exist and the governmental

21

interest served by the intrusion.

22

first step, the court erred, in our view, in elaborating

23

that rule in this context, by overstating the

24

intrusiveness of a protective sweep and undervaluing the

25

governmental interest to justify those searches.

But having taken that

The court resolved upon what we believe to be an

1
2

untenable legal standard, that a protective sweep may be

3

conducted only upon a showing of probable cause.
We urge a different rule, the rule that has been

4
5

approved by virtually every federal circuit other than, I

6

think, the Fifth Circuit, and one that is based on our

7

quite different assessment of the competing interest.

8

That rule is the one derived from Terry against Ohio, and

9

it is this:

Following an arrest inside a suspect's

10

premises, the, a protective sweep is lawful when the

11

police have a reasonable belief that their security is in

12

jeopardy.

13

Now, that rule —

QUESTION:

15
16

How would that unfold in this case,

on these facts?
MR. ROBBINS:

On these facts, Justice O'Connor,

17

we believe that the police did indeed have a reasonably —

18

a reasonable suspicion that their security was at risk in

19

the execution of this arrest warrant.

1

I think, Justice Stevens, what

2

they thought, or in any event what the objective factors

3

would have justified them in thinking, was that in fact

another person could well have been in the house and would

injury to the police.

Do you think there was a greater risk

8

of violence by entering the basement or staying out of the

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, I think that's that kind of

judgment that cops have got to be allowed to make.

was I am not going in the basement until this fellow comes

making about whether they in fact took reasonable action

every one of these things to a strictly logical

proposition governed by Marquis of Queensbury rules.

There has got to be some play in the joints.

are cases that have said that.
MR. KOPOLOW:

And there

Well, I think what Your Honor is

in every case the police should be able to sweep through

the house.

13

to the boundaries — it can be rationally limited to the

14

boundaries of the house.

15

in the earlier arguments, might not the police sense

16

danger from a neighboring apartment, if it involves the

17

sweep of an apartment?

And I don't think it can be limited, really,

QUESTION:

18

For instance, as was suggested

But police procedures, police

19

training, don't require them to assume that the best

20

possible circumstances prevail when they make an arrest.

21

It requires them to assume that the worst possible

22

circumstances may prevail.

they go into the police car.

And it seems

to me rather difficult for you to ask us to make the

assumption that safety conditions will generally prevail,

or that a safe condition would generally prevail when they

enter into a home.

5

MR. KOPOLOW:

In the context of a Terry stop,

6

the police cannot assume that the suspect is armed and

7

dangerous.

8

police officer has to point to some -- some particular

9

facts.

Yet that is a possibility in every case.

That is my understanding of how the Fourth

10

Amendment cases have been developing.

11

particular holding into this case, the police cannot

12

assume that someone else, someone else dangerous, is

13

the basement.

14

To translate that

They have to —

QUESTION;

Of course, of course in that case,

articulated suspicion suffices in this case.

MR. KOPOLOW:

2

If he has articulated suspicion

3

that crime is afoot he can make the stop.

any further unless he has articulated suspicion that the

5

person he has stopped is armed and dangerous.

6

translated into this case, he has to have articulated

7

suspicion that somebody who is dangerous is in the

basement.
QUESTION:

9

He cannot go

And

I think some of our more recent cases

10

have allowed the person — an officer to go further than

just the frisk in connection with a Terry stop.

12

Michigan against Long did, and I think another case has.

13

MR. KOPOLOW:

I think

Well, there again, once the stop -

14

- in Michigan v. Long, once the stop is lawfully made,

15

there cannot be an automatic search of the car, the

16

passenger compartment of the car, for weapons.

17

to be articulated suspicion that there may be weapons in

18

the car and that the person stopped is dangerous.

19

that is the clear holding of Michigan v. Long.
