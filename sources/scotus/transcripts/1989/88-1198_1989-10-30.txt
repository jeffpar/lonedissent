ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER/CROSS-RESPONDENT

11

MR. ISENSTADT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case involves a group of competing private

12

practice criminal defense attorneys who agreed among

13

themselves to withhold their services from the District of

14

Columbia until the District increased the price it paid for

15

those services.

16

boycott was the essence of price-fixing, and that the First

17

Amendment does not immunize such price-fixing from antitrust

18

review, even if it is used in an effort to induce the passage

19

of legislation.

20

respects, the court of appeals was clearly correct and its

21

decision should be affirmed.

22

The court of appeals held that the lawyers'

Then, however, the court reversed course and held that

public importance.

I shall argue that this novel exception to

2

the Sherman Acts per se prohibition against naked price-fixing

3

agreements is unsupported by law and would have serious

4

effects for antitrust enforcement if left to stand.

5

A brief review of the facts demonstrates the

6

correctness of the court of appeals' conclusion that the

7

lawyers' boycott was the essence of price-fixing.

8

the boycott the District of Columbia government offered $30

per hour for court time and $20 per hour for out-of-court time

Prior to

to any attorney who volunteered to represent indigent

11

defendants in Superior Court under the Criminal Justice Act.
No attorney was required to offer his services at that

12

13

rate.

Attorneys who wished to do so competed for the city's

14

legal business by calling in each morning and asking that

15

their names be placed on a list from which counsel was

16

assigned that day.

17

day before the boycott, enough attorneys volunteered at the

18

rates offered by the city to provide counsel for all indigent

defendants who required it.

20

increase in the CJA rate, the lawyers conducted a lobbying

21

campaign in late 1982 and '83 with which no one takes issue,

22

but when they grew dissatisfied with the pace and results of

23

the city's legislative process, they met, on August 11, 1983,

24

and agreed among themselves that if the rate increase were not

25

forthcoming by September 6th they would collectively cease to

The boycott began as intended, and as the lawyers

3

expected, it had a severe impact on the District of Columbia

nearly all those who had at the time made a practice of

6

accepting Criminal Justice Act cases.

7

showed up to accept cases during the boycott became quickly

8

overloaded, prompting the head of the Public Defenders Service

9

to write Mayor Barry on September 15 and advise him that the

10

available attorney pool was no longer sufficient to continue

11

to assure the appointment of counsel for all indigent

12

defendants. In response to that communication, the Mayor

13

recommended and the city council enacted legislation

14

increasing the CJA rate to $35 an hour for both in court and

15

out-of-court time.

course, the situation that occurred here.
QUESTION:

5

That is not, of

Well, the reason I ask it, because you do

6

indicate that you had looked to the actual market effect of

7

what occurred in order to prove that there was a boycott.

8
9

MR. ISENSTADT:

Your Honor, the Commission found both

that the boycott was unlawful per se and under rule of reason

10

analysis, and we think it was correct on both counts.

11

what is per se unlawful is an agreement among competitors as

12

to the price at which they will deal, and that is true whether

13

the competitors number only a few or number here more than a

14

hundred.

15

two or three competitors in a market served by one hundred

16

will make such an agreement, because it would have no effect.

17

And that is not what happened here.

But, of course, one doesn't find typically that only

QUESTION:

The —

(Inaudible) boycott do you — you just have

19

an agreement — we just won't work for any less than a certain

20

amount?

21

MR. ISENSTADT:

It's price-fixing boycott, Your Honor.

22

It was price-fixing that was implemented by means of a

23

boycott.

24

it said, the essence of price-fixing and a classic restraint

25

of trade within the meaning of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.

And the court of appeals recognized that it was, as

1

And this Court has never wavered in its recognition that naked

2

price-fixing agreements are unlawful per se, without regard to

3

whether the conspirators have market power.

4

The court of appeals also correctly recognized that

5

there is no First Amendment immunity for such conduct.

6

Noerr doctrine establishes that competitors may associate

7

together for the purpose of attempting to persuade the

8

legislature to enact legislation, and even though that

9

legislation may itself result»in fixing prices or restricting

10

output, that does not convert the joint effort to achieve such

11

legislation into a contract in restraint of trade.

12

Noerr doctrine does not permit competitors to fix prices or

13

restrict output themselves as a means of pressuring the

14

legislature.

15

The

But the

In the Noerr case, the only conduct involved was a

The lawyers here did

Although the court of appeals correctly recognized that

there is no First Amendment immunity for the boycott in this

case, it then reversed course and held that if the boycott

1

in United States v. O'Brien rather than the test in Noerr,

2

that the boycott would be entitled to constitutional

3

protection from application of the per se rule against naked

4

price-fixing agreements.

5

We think the court's application of the O'Brien test in

6

this situation was both incorrect and unnecessary.

It was

7

unnecessary because this Court, in the Noerr doctrine, has

8

already balanced the rights of competitors to act in collusion

9

to petition the legislature against the rights of the public

10

to be protected from anti-competitive restraints of trade.

11

And the balance struck in Noerr is that competitors may

12

jointly lobby, but they may not jointly fix prices.

13

apply a further O'Brien test in this context basically

14

subverts the test established by the Court in Noerr.

15

And to

Even, however, if one does apply the O'Brien test here,

16

it does not result in the conclusion that the Sherman Act is

17

unconstitutional as applied to the facts of this case.

18

per se prohibition against naked price-fixing agreements

19

proceeds from the recognition that such agreements are always

20

— are almost always harmful to competition, and are never

21

helpful to it.

22

government from enforcing categorical prohibitions against

23

generally harmful conduct, merely because such conduct may not

24

be harmful in particular instances.

1

First Amendment does not bar application of a neutral

2

regulation that incidentally burden speech merely because a

3

party contends that allowing an exception in the particular

4

case will not threaten important government interests.

5

Put another way, the per se rule against price-fixing

6

serves important values of business certainty and litigation

7

efficiency.

8

governmental interests that the court is required to consider

9

in conducting an O'Brien analysis.

10
11

And those in themselves are substantial

The court of appeals did

not credit those interests here.
The Respondents maintain that it is inappropriate to

12

apply the per se rule because of the assumption that underlies

13

it, that naked price-fixing agreements are generally harmful,

14

does not apply in the case of such agreements directed at

15

legislative targets.

16

themselves demonstrate the validity of that assumption, even

17

assuming the court felt it appropriate to reexamine it in the

18

circumstances of this case.

19

But I think that the facts of this case

As I have said, the lawyers who engaged in this boycott

comprised nearly all those who made a practice at the time of

accepting Criminal Justice Act assignments.

MR. ISENSTADT:

11

QUESTION:

What do you think it —

12

MR. ISENSTADT:

It said it was not sufficient to show

13

that the boycott had harmful effects, such as threatening a

14

shut down of the court system, because those effects might

15

have resulted from the communicative impact of the boycott

16

rather than its coercive impact.

17

demonstrate that the CJA lawyers had market power so that we

18

could, from that, infer that the actual demonstrated harmful

19

effects were the result of such power rather than of

communication.

because, of course, the same objection could be raised in

22

almost any case.

QUESTION;

So, this was not a case of the court of

2

appeals saying we want you to separate the lobbying effort

3

from the boycott.

4

boycott itself, in effect?

5

They said you have got to split up the

MR. ISENSTADT:

That is correct.

We — we did not

6

challenge the lobbying effort that preceded the boycott, and

7

the dividing line is very clear.

8

communicative activities that were conducted at the same time

9

as the boycott, such as contacts with the press and so forth.

Nor do we challenge the

10

We challenge only the collective refusal to supply services to

11

the city at the price it was offering.

12

I think, for the reasons I have indicated, that under a

13

rule of reason analysis properly conceived, the conduct here

14

could properly be condemned, and the Commission so held in the

15

alternative in its opinion.

demonstrate that there is no reason in this case to revisit

the Sherman Act's -— the validity of the Sherman Act's per se

prohibition against naked price-fixing agreements.

directed against legislatures, they are typically just as

20

harmful as when directed against private parties.

think it is important for the Court to reiterate the

applicability of the per se rule in the facts of this case.

But I also cite these facts to

They asked for what?

MR. ISENSTADT:

Different lawyers had different

requests.

Wasn't one of thej.r original demands for $55

MR. ISENSTADT:

QUESTION:

MR. ISENSTADT:

23

They were getting $30

an hour, and they wanted $55, didn't they?

19

22

That is basically what they did before

That was the demand of some lawyers,

And what did they get?
The final bill was $35.

That was the

request of other lawyers.
There is a question, by the way, as to whether, as a

24

general matter, competitors, in markets where sellers set the

25

price, can agree among themselves even on a lobbying price,

But I think in this case, where the seller -- the

8

The court of appeals stated that the novel rule that it

9

was created rested heavily on the peculiar facts of this case,

10

but the court did not identify any facts that could serve to

11

distinguish this case in a principled and legally significant

12

way from any others.

13

14

services in an effort to obtain an increase in the price, then

15

there is no way to deny the same treatment to doctors who

16

would withhold their services in an effort to obtain an

17

increase in state Medicaid reimbursement rates, or pharmacists

18

who would withhold their services in an effort to increase the

19

rates for which states reimburse them under prepaid

20

prescription plans, or a great many other government suppliers

21

who believe, as sincerely as the lawyers did in this case,

22

that the public would benefit from increased expenditures on

All I am saying is, I think your analogy to

the medical profession is a flawed one, and I am still

concerned about where there is market power here, when the

14

court could order the full bar to perform.

15

MR. ISENSTADT:

Your Honor, I must say,

16

parenthetically, it is not, it is not clear to me the extent

17

of the court's authority to order lawyers to report.

in the Mallard decision last year the majority seemed to

indicate that it is at least an open question as to whether

Mr. Tom, if we take that approach, your —

Justice Scalia, the Noerr doctrine is based

18

both in the First Amendment and in an examination of the

20

I think it recognizes that there is something special about

21

the legislative process, and that the types of consequences

that are likely to flow from conduct directed at the

But we have to disagree with the court of

10

MR. TOM:

QUESTION:

On that point I think it — I think yes.
Well, the court of appeals treated Noerr,

and thought that Noerr said you can lobby but you can't

Which, frankly, is what I thought Noerr said too.

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. TOM:

But, Mr. Chief Justice, it was the lower

16

courts in Noerr that had tried to draw the distinction between

17

pure speech and -- and some kind of speech plus, and this

Court reversed.

there was more than self interest at stake, witness Joanne

And the fact that most of these lawyers

in any boycotting group, not that they are totally, dominantly

We are not

that each individual point must be examined in isolation and

But I think it is significant that we had strong issues

a debate that was long ongoing about whether the Sixth
