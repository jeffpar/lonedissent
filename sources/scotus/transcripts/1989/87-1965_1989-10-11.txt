manner.

The

10

controlling inquiry in the Hudson case was solely whether the

11

state is in a position to provide for pre-deprivation process

12

and not whether the errant employees are.

13

So you look at it from the perspective of the state.

14

in Hudson, this Court specifically rejected the argument that

15

because an agent can provide pre-deprivation due process then,

16

as a matter of law, as a matter of course, he must do so.

17

And

The Court said that reflects a fundamental misunderstanding

18

of Parratt.

Parratt versus Taylor recognized that a due process

19

deprivation could occur as the result of the failure to follow

20

state procedures.

21

Contrary to this, the plurality opinion says that disregard

22

of state law or procedures can never be unauthorized when the

23

state agents had some authority to act.

24
25

The petitioners here only had the authority to accept Mr.
Burch as a voluntary patient, if he qualified to be one.

they did not take action to voluntarily commit him.

actions were beyond the control of the state in the sense of
