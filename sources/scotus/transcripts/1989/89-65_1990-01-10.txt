ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. WRIGHT

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. WRIGHT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Army operates schools for the dependents of

12

personnel stationed at Fort Stewart, Georgia.

13

arose when the union that represents the teachers at those

14

schools made a number of proposals relating to wages and

15

fringe benefits, including a proposal to increase wages

16

across the board by 13.5 percent.

17

This case

The Army refused to negotiate, relying on

18

various provisions of the Federal Labor Management

19

Relations statute and on a statute and a regulation

20

specifically directed to the dependents' schools.

21

FLRA held that the proposals are negotiable in a divided

22

opinion, and the court of appeals affirmed.

23

The

We believe that the Army's refusal to bargain is

24

justified for three reasons.

First, Congress did not make

25

wages negotiable in the Federal sector.

Second, it

1

instead gave agency management control of agency budgets.

2

And third, the salaries of teachers at the dependents'

3

schools are to be set by comparison with the salaries of

4

teachers at the local public schools.

5

Before I discuss those three reasons, I'd like

6

to emphasize that it is undisputed that the vast majority

7

of Federal employees may not bargain about pay.

8

of most Federal employees is set by the general schedule

9

and such employees, about a million and a half in all, are

The pay

10

paid what Congress says in the general schedule they are

11

paid.

12

13
14

The FLRA has changed its position with respect
to another large group of employees -QUESTION:

Mr. Wright, with respect to that

15

first category of employees, is bargaining over their

16

wages specifically excluded by the act, by the FLRA?

17

MR. WRIGHT:

It -- it works that way.

We -- we

18

-- it is undisputed we think for three reasons.

19

there is nothing in the act that says general schedule

20

employees cannot bargain about wages in so many words.

21

A —

However, the portion of the act that makes --

22

that mandates bargaining, says that bargaining is not

23

permitted where a matter is specifically provided by

24

Federal statute.

25

That is Section 7109(a)(14)(c).

In addition, Section 7117 provides that a

1

proposal cannot be in conflict with a Federal law, and a

2

-- and a proposal to pay someone differently than what

3

Congress has set in the Federal schedule would be contrary

4

to law.
Both the union and the FLRA would agree with

5
6

that I believe.

7

that the management rights provision which gives

8

management control of the agency budget also means that --

9

that the pay of general schedule employees can't be set by

10

They would not agree with our third point

statute.
QUESTION:

11

Mr. Wright, the -- the employees

12

whose wages are at issue here are not employees where

13

Federal law sets their wage, as I understand it.

14

MR. WRIGHT:

That's correct.

We -- we think

15

that they are in many ways similar to prevailing rate

16

employees.

17

QUESTION:

And before this statute was enacted,

18

there was an executive order that provided substantially

19

similar provisions?

20

MR. WRIGHT:

It was similar in some ways.

21

language was not identical.

22

for bargaining over working conditions.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

The

It did provide -- it provided

And under the former executive order,

would the bargaining proposal here have been upheld?
MR. WRIGHT:

The FLRC, the FLRA's predecessor,

1

did hold in two cases that pay was negotiable.

And you've

2

gone to the strongest point in their case, so let me --

3

let me address it right now.
As the D.C. Circuit stated in its excellent

4
5

opinion in the overseas schools case, we believe that the

6

practice under the FLRC and the executive order regime has

7

been superseded by the FLRA, for the reasons the D.C.

8

Circuit gave and the reasons I will give in the bulk of my

9

argument.

10

Namely, that the language Congress used, the

11

statements it made in the legislative history, and its

12

reservation to management of control of the budget confirm

13

that Congress did not want bargaining over wages under the

14

Federal Service Labor Management Relations statute.

15

I'd like to make two other points with respect

16

to the FLRC decisions.

17

conditions was not raised in either of those cases.

18

FLRC never specifically decided that issue.

19

First, whether wages were working

Second, it's clear that Congress was not aware

20

of those two decisions.

21

Senate that, under the FLRC — the FLRC had held that

22

under the executive order regime that wages are not

23

negotiable.

24
25

The

In fact, Senator Sasser told the

Now, normally Congress does intend to carry
forward prior practice.

But we think that it intends to

2

carry forward the prior practice as it understands it.
QUESTION:

Well, don't we assume they

3

understand?

4

the congressmen have the read cases?

5

When have we gone around examining whether

MR. WRIGHT:

I don't -- I don't know any example

6

of a case quite like this one where a senator specifically

7

said that pay is not negotiable under the FLRC cases.

8

9
10
11

QUESTION:

But that comment could reflect the

generality of the fact that most Federal employees are -are -- their salaries are set by law.
MR. WRIGHT:

It's possible.

Our primary answer

12

would be, as the D.C. Circuit stated, that we think for

13

the majority of the reasons I will try to give that

14

Congress didn't want wages to be negotiable under the --

15

under the --

16

QUESTION:

In what respect was the governing

17

language here different from the language of the executive

18

order, the FLRC --

19

MR. WRIGHT:

It did not specifically refer to

20

conditions of employment.

21

conditions of employment are negotiable.

22

it to include personnel policies, practices and matters

23

affecting working conditions.

24

executive order simply referred to working conditions.

25

The Act now says that
It -- it defines

But -- but it -- but the

Now, conditions of employment, we think are —

•

1

are important because in the -- in the NLRA Congress made
wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment

3

negotiable.

QUESTION:

4

You think conditions of employment,

5

which is used in the statute, is a narrower term than

6

working conditions?

7

MR WRIGHT:

Well, we think the different term —

8

QUESTION:

Do you think conditions of employment

9

is less likely to include wages than working conditions?
MR. WRIGHT:

10
11

similar.

13

Well, they are obviously very

My point in mentioning it —

12

*

It specifically said wages are negotiable.

QUESTION:

I don't think so.

I think a -- a

condition of employment might well be what you get paid
for the employment, but I don't think that what you get

15

paid for employment would normally be called a working

16

condition.

17

MR. WRIGHT:

Well, in this case, of course, it's

18

-- conditions of employment are defined to include matters

19

affecting working conditions.

20

somewhat a different language here.

21

So Congress has used

What we think is most important is looking at

22

both the NLRA and the Postal Reorganization Act.

23

times Congress has made wages negotiable, it has said so

24

specifically.

25

The Postal Reorganization Act to our mind is

actually the most analogous statute because it also

2

affects Federal employees and because the committees here

3

that drafted the bill — the House committee was the

4

Committee on the Postal Service and the Civil Service.

5

In the Postal Reorganization Act in 1971

6

Congress made wages, hours and conditions of employment —

7

I'm sorry -- wages, hours and working conditions

8

negotiable.

9

the NLRA, that wages are negotiable.

10

It specifically said, as it said in the -- in

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Wright, on conditions of

11

employment, does it include, in your view, more than

12

physical working conditions?

13

MR. WRIGHT:

Yes, we agree, as we tried to

14

explain in our reply brief, that basically our position

15

would be in accord with Justice Stewart's statements in

16

his concurring opinion in the Fibreboard case.

17
18

QUESTION:

Why do you think that a condition of

employment might not be the wage that's paid?

19

MR. WRIGHT:

Well, as Justice Stewart explained,

20

and as the D.C. Circuit explained, the -- the first

21

impression you would get from that language is that

22

Congress was talking about the physical conditions of

23

work.

Well it isn't — the term isn't self-

explanatory .

MR. WRIGHT:

2

QUESTION:

3

That's true.

We think that

Then why wouldn't we defer to the

agency's interpretation of it, the FLRA?
MR. WRIGHT:

4

Well, because we think that after

5

this Court uses the traditional tools of statutory

6

construction, as this Court said was appropriate in the

7

Chevron case involving deference, that the Court will be

8

left with the impression, like four courts of appeals,

9

that the statute -- clearly that Congress in the statute

10

clearly did not mean to wait -- to make wages negotiable.

11

As I have said --

12

QUESTION:

Well, there — do you feel that the

13

FLRA's conclusion is unreasonable under the Chevron

14

principle?
MR. WRIGHT:

15

Yes.

Once one looks at what

16

Congress has done in other statutes, what the Congressmen

17

said on the floor of the House and what Congress did in

18

the budget right in the statute -QUESTION:

19

big mountain for you to get across.
MR. WRIGHT:

21
22

Well, Your Honor, I am sorry to

hear that.

(Laughter.)

24

MR. WRIGHT:

25

It seems to me that that is a great

But as I say, the majority of the

courts of appeals have agreed with our position, even

1

though they've recognized that the FLRA is entitled to

2

deference.

3

I might add that the FLRA is entitled to

4

deference with respect to its interpretation of the

5

Federal Labor Management law.

6

deference with respect to its interpretation of the

7

dependents' school statute.

QUESTION:

It is not entitled to

How -- how much weight would we

ordinarily give to the action of Congress in 1935 says

10

wages are to be bargained about under the NLRA?

11

in 1971 says they are to be bargained about in the Postal

12

Service Act.

13

in '78 and says conditions of employment.

14

Congress

Then Congress comes along seven years after

It seems to me that inference is not as strong,

15

or as if you are talking about the same statute where

16

Congress says one thing in one section and uses a

17

different phrase in another section.

18

MR. WRIGHT:

It would be a better case for us

19

were that the case.

20

were Congress has made matters bargainable.

21

it has made wages bargainable, it has said wages.

22

Postal Reorganization Act was very much on Congress' mind

23

in — in enacting this statute.

24
25

But those are the three situations
The two times
The

Congressman Udall, who authored the compromise
that was enacted, specifically contrasted the practice

1

under the Postal Reorganization Act to what -- the

2

practice under his bill.

3

that pay would not be negotiable under this statute,

4

saying that the bargainability of wages for the Postal

5

Employees had been very troublesome.

6

And he assured his colleagues

In addition, two proposals were made to Congress

7

to make wages negotiable.

8

bill that would have made wages generally negotiable, and

9

Congressman Heftel introduced a more limited proposal that

Congressman Ford proposed a

10

would have made pay negotiable so far as consonant with

11

the law and regulation.
Neither of these proposals were enacted.

12

They

13

were both rejected, and we think that that is significant.

14

Another --

15

QUESTION:

Is any part of your case that

16

bargaining would be inconsistent with the statute that

17

controls or organizes these dependent schools?

18

MR. WRIGHT:

Yes.

Yes.

That's -- we -- we

19

think that in that statute, in a nutshell, Section 241 and

20

Subsection (a) says that these schools are to be

21

comparable to schools in the states where they are

22

located.

23

the dependents' schools shall not exceed, so far as

24

practicable, the per-pupil costs at the local public

25

schools.

Subsection (e) says that the per-pupil costs of

12

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005

(800) FOR DEPO

Now, the Army has interpreted that reasonably,

1
2

in our view, to mean that if you are going to offer

3

comparable education at a comparable per-pupil cost, you

4

have to pay teachers comparably.

5

the most important component in many educational -QUESTION:

6

Teachers are, after all,

So if the Army has that authority

7

under — to interpret its statute that way, you would say

8

that — that bargaining would be inconsistent with some of

9

the law.
MR. WRIGHT:

10

Yes.

That that's our third

11

argument in this case.

It's independent ground for

12

overturning the decisions below.

We think it's --

13

QUESTION:

Were the unions --

14

QUESTION:

Do you think it's your weakest

15

argument?

Is that it?

16

MR. WRIGHT:

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. WRIGHT:

19

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

It's — it's our narrowest

argument.

20

(Laughter.)

21

QUESTION:

Were the teachers here, the unions,

22

asserting that -- that they were entitled to wages that

23

were not comparable?

24

seem to me a very precise term and then there's -- there's

25

a lot of room for bargaining while still remaining within

I mean, comparable wages doesn't

MR. WRIGHT:

Well, in fact, the proposals do not

purport to be comparable.

MR. WRIGHT:

categories:

get a certain amount of money and that's -- that's the way

19

these things are done.

And so, if you have a special ed decree --

QUESTION:

So they're —

identical and you might say a couple of hundred dollars

more in light of greater distance to travel to get to this

wouldn't that be considered --

Yes.

be comparable.

It is the regulation that says that

2

salaries schedules have to be comparable.
I'd like to make one other point with respect to

3

4

our -- our primary contention, our contention that wages

5

are not negotiable.

6

This statute is different from the private

7

sector in that, if a matter is negotiable, the Federal

8

Service Impasses Panel can impose a proposal on an agency

9

over its objection.

So, in this case, if the FLRA

10

prevails, the salaries of dependents' school's teachers

11

could ultimately be set by arbitrators rather than by the

12

agency.
We think, especially in that circumstance, if

13
14

Congress wanted not only to make wages negotiable but to

15

allow a system where they might ultimately be set by --

16

outside the agency, it surely would have said so in the

17

statute.

18

QUESTION:

19

Panel appointed?

appointment.

21

How is the Federal Services Impasses

I'm not familiar with the manner of its

MR. WRIGHT:

It's an agency within the FLRA, and

22

it is my understanding that the FLRA has a semi-permanent

23

panel of members of the Impasses Panel, but that they also

24

-- that the Impasses Panel itself relies very heavily on

25

the Federal Mediation Service.

And it in turn sends many

1

matters to arbitrators under the Federal Mediation

2

Service.

3

QUESTION:

Is there any review authorized of a

4

decision of the Impasse Panel?

5

MR. WRIGHT:

Not that I know of.

The FLRA

6

reviews grievance decisions by arbitrators, but I do not

7

understand that they review Impasse Panel decisions.

8

9

QUESTION:

Those decisions can be arbitrary and

capricious, as far as we --

10

MR. WRIGHT:

They certainly can.

11

Let me make one other point with respect to our

12

argument that wages aren't conditions of employment, and

13

-- and that is that after the Ford and Heftel proposals

14

were rejected, congressman after congressman got up on the

15

floor of the House and assured their colleagues that wages

16

weren't negotiable.

17

reinforces our conclusion.

And -- and we think that that

18

In addition, on our second argument that the

19

budget right gives agencies control of the budget, the

20

Is it your understanding that when

MR. WRIGHT:

Yes, I believe so because what they

7

across the board pay increase would improve employee

8

morale and that would be the compensating benefit here

that would outweigh the costs of the 13.5 percent

Now, I suppose employee morale improving might

cut down on turnover and ultimately lead to some monetary

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

13

Thank you, Mr. Wright.

MR. PERSINA:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The Authority's holding in this case, affirmed

14

by a unanimous court of appeals, stands on three eminently

15

reasonable points.

16

First, that the compensation paid to a Federal

17

employee for work performed constitutes an aspect of that

18

employee's work relationship with his or her employer.

19

Indeed, compensation is probably the primary condition

20

upon which the employment relationship is initiated and

21

maintained.

22

So for the relative handful of Federal

23

employees, such as those in this case, whose compensation

24

is not established in statute, compensation is a mandatory

25

bargaining subject under the Federal Sector Labor law.

The authorities second point is that simply

1
2

because a bargaining proposal entails an initial or facial

3

cost, that is not enough of a reason in itself to conclude

4

that implementation of the proposal will interfere with

5

the agency's budget right.

6

Rather, that agency employer must show that the

7

real cost impact of that proposal, after its compensating

8

benefits are taken into account, will require the agency

9

to seek more money through the budget process to conduct

its affairs than it had originally determined was

the Authority has not ruled it out.

It would take that

think the offset need be a dollar and cent exact figure as

An agency that shows that there's enough of a

chance, that there is a substantial amount of money that

will be needed or a significant amount of money that would

be needed to be obtained in addition to what they thought

9

they need to run the schools, I would think would win

10

their compensating benefits analysis.
But we don't even have an employer here who is

11

12

attempting to make any showing on that issue.

And I think

13

what we really have here is the reasonableness of the

14

test.
And how the Authority treats things like

15
16

intangible benefits of a proposal as opposed to tangible,

17

I think really remains to be seen over time when some

18

agency employers start trying to meet the test on its

19

terms rather than attacking it.
We think it's a reasonable test that's entitled

21

to a chance, and no agency employer has done that yet.

MR. PERSINA:

This statute just says

Well, Your Honor, I think in those

manifestly wanted to make pay negotiable for all employees

who were covered under that law.

Under the Federal Sector statute, the situation

is very different.

12

employees but had no concern with the relatively few

I think if I were a Congress that wanted to make

pay non-negotiable for 97 percent of the employees to be

7

covered under the statute, but didn't have a concern with

8

the few small groups of employees who could negotiate

I would write the law in just the way that the statute is

written to allow —

QUESTION:

13
14

You mean the conditions of employment

just doesn't include wages for 97 percent of the people?
MR. PERSINA:

Well, it does not include wages

because of the operation of the statutory exclusion from

Yes, indeed, Congress did seek to make pay non­

20

negotiable for the great majority of Federal employees,

21

but it did it in 7103(a)(14)(C), not in the substantive

Indeed, we think a claim that the main quid for

4

think that is plain in terms of just looking at an

7

So pay can go to the very existence of the employment

relationship itself.

And we

That

And, indeed, we think it's a major failing of

10

the schools' case here, that they have offered us no

11

workable theory whatsoever for why it is that compensation

12

does not constitute personnel policies, practices and

13

matters affecting working conditions.

14

But the strength of that point, that

15

compensation is a condition of employment in this case for

16

these employees, is supported not just by the plain

17

language of the definition itself.

18

by the executive order practice that took place prior to

19

the statute.

20

It is also supported

Both Executive Orders 10988 and 11491 delineated

21

the scope of bargain subjects by saying that personnel

22

policies and practices and matters affecting working

23

conditions were within the scope of the bargaining

2

And really, contrary to my brother Wright's

3

remarks earlier in the argument that the executive orders

4

did not reference conditions of employment, in the

5

preambles to both those executive orders, Congress did

6

just that.

7

-- to negotiate on the conditions of their employment.
In Section 11(a) of the executive orders it then

8

9

It said that employees should be able to work

said that personnel policies and practices and matters

10

affecting working conditions were proper bargaining

11

subjects.

12

in the statute to carry over that executive order

13

practice.

14

So we think it plain that Congress was looking

And I would also indicate that in the Federal

15

Labor Relations Council's Merchant Marine decision, which

16

we've cited in our brief, Congress did explicitly say that

17

compensation -- or the Council, rather, said that

18

compensation is a personnel policy and practice and matter

19

affecting working conditions.

20

And the only way under the executive orders that

21

compensation was made non-negotiable, was through its

22

being established in legislation and that is precisely the

23

system that Congress carried over under the statute.

24
25

So the situation in Federal sector labor
relations at the time that Congress considered the statute

was clear.

Compensation did constitute personnel

2

policies, practices and matters affecting working

3

conditions and was only non-negotiable if it was

4

established through legislation.

5

the legislative history of the statute which shows that

6

Congress wanted to change that situation.

And there is nothing in

In fact, there are a number of indicators that

7
8

Congress wanted to maintain just that state of affairs

9

under the statute, both in its language — in its choice

10

of language in the statute and the debates that took

11

place.

12

As to the language, we've already seen.

13

Congress adopted the same substantive parameters for the

14

bargaining relationship and it made pay non-negotiable for

15

most employees by — by inserting the proviso that matters

16

specifically established in Federal statute are non-

17

negotiable.

18

executive orders.

19

That's just the way it was done under the

And I would also point to Section 7135(b) of the

20

statute where Congress said that it wanted, among other

21

things, the decisions of the Federal Labor Relations

22

Council to continue in effect or until changed by the

23

statute itself or through decisions of the FLRA.

24

neither of those events have occurred.

25

And

So we think it plain that Congress' treatment of

1

the executive order practice makes it clear that it

2

intended to carry that practice over.

3

among the key legislators in the bill also support that

4

conclusion.

But the debates

The legislators — and among them I am speaking

5
6

of Congressmen Clay, Ford, Udall and Collins, who are

7

among some of the most important figures in the enactment

8

of the statute -- all said and made clear their

9

understanding that compensation would not be negotiable

10

under the statute because it would be set by legislation

11

of the Congress.

12

pages 28 and 29 of our brief.

And we have cited these passages on

And these remarks must form our backdrop for the

13
14

selected excerpts from the legislative history that the

15

schools rely on so heavily here, where legislators would

16

simply say that pay would be non-negotiable without

17

specifying how that result would be achieved.
And yet that is the key inquiry for the

18
19

legislative history.

How is that result to be achieved?

20

And as I've indicated, we think it plain that the only

21

intent for those remarks can be to make it non-negotiable

22

through operation of legislation.
And I can state this conclusion with a very

23
24

sound foundation, and that is the language of the statute

25

itself.

Because if Congress really meant by those remarks

1

that it wanted to pay -- make pay non-negotiable as a

2

subject matter per se, it would have said so in the

3

statute.

4

before we will find an express exclusion of pay matters.

And yet we will look long and hard in that law

5

Rather, what we see is, well, the Authority's

6

view of the legislative history and that is that pay is

7

made non-negotiable to the extent, considerable as it is,

8

that Congress wanted to control that matter through

9

legislation.
So it is the Authority's view of the legislative

10
11

history that finds voice in the language of the statute

12

and not the schools'.

13

Authority's view should be affirmed.

MR. PERSINA:

It's --

It is not.
Panel members, as I understand it,

5

meet approximately once a month to resolve impasses, but

6

they are part-time Federal employees and officials.

7
8

QUESTION:

Is it — is it correct that their

decisions are nonreviewable?

9

MR. PERSINA:

That is not correct, Your Honor.

10

Panel decisions are reviewable indirectly for sufficiency

11

with law.

12

circuits I believe.

13

And the D.C. Circuit has so held, among other

If an agency employer believes their panel

14

decision is contrary to law, it can refuse to comply with

15

that panel decision, take an unfair labor practice which

16

the Authority would resolve, and the Authority's unfair

17

labor practice ruling would be reviewed in an appropriate

18

circuit court of appeals.

19

So there is indirect review.

23

That is in volume 735 F.2d, although the page

about the panel, there is at least one case that I know of

had a bargaining pay -- an impasse in bargaining that

2

dealt with setting pay.

3

Marine case where the panel went with the employer's point

4

of view.

And the — this is a Merchant

That is the one we know of where salary rates

5
6

themselves were the primary focus of the impasse.

Again,

7

these don't come up very often for the panel, because pay

8

is non-negotiable for so many employees.

9

for the employer in that case.

But they ruled

And we think that the

10

notion that the panel is some rogue body that is off doing

11

irrational things and can't be reviewed is simply wrong.
They have demonstrated responsible conduct in

12

13

this area, and their decisions are subject to review.

14

the —

15

QUESTION:

So

Are those decisions -- is it like

16

baseball free agency where the panel has to pick either

17

one proposal or the other, or can it come up with a — can

it say -- can it say either your proposal is — has to be

accepted or your proposal can be rejected?

20

some sort of a compromise?

course.
In concluding on the conditions of employment

3

point, I would just like to note briefly concerning these

4

-- this battle over the outside statutes that we seem to

5

be engaged in here, inappropriate as it is, we think.

6

Nonetheless, we think these outside laws are very much

7

supportive of our case.

8

expressly equates wages with conditions of employment.

9

The National Labor Relations Act

We would also prefer to look closer to home for

10

the statute.

11

which again expressly equates compensation with conditions

12

of employments, as we've pointed out in our brief.

13

That is, the Senior Executive Service Act,

The Senior Executive Service law is another

14

title of the Civil Service Reform Act, Title IV, the

15

Authority is under Title VII.

16

itself is Congress' recognition that compensation is a

17

form of a condition of employment.

18

And here in the Reform Act

So if we are to engage in this -- this debate

19

about what do outside law show, we think, if anything,

20

it's supportive.

21

But the real point, we think, on conditions of

22

employment, is to look at our statute.

23

that's before us and that statute defines the very term

24

that we are seeking to construe and apply here.

25

does it in a way that clearly encompasses compensation.

That's the statute

And it

And that should be the end of the matter.
I would just like to conclude on the condition

2

3

of employment point by being so presumptuous, I think, as

4

to suggest to this Court what kind of opinion it would

5

have to write in order to grant the schools' position

6

here.

7

First of all, it would have to explain why it is

8

that compensation is not a personnel policy, practice or

9

matter affecting working conditions.

Failing that, it

10

would have to engraft under the statute an exception for

11

pay which is not in the law.

12

It would also have to explain why it is that the

13

key legislators in the statute kept saying that pay would

14

be non-negotiable because it would be regulated through

15

legislation.

16

exactly where it is in the legislative history that the --

17

that the Congress decided that it did not want to carry

18

over the executive order practice.

5

MR. PERSINA:

But the task need not

be faced because the right view of this case on this issue

7

is the Authority's point.
I'd like to now turn to the budget issue and

8

9

that test that we consider here, whether the union's

10

proposals constitute or entail significant and unavoidable

11

costs that are not offset by compensating benefits.

12

this analysis is called for under the Authority's long-

13

established budget test for determining when a proposal

14

interferes with the budget right.

15

And

I do want to stress again the reasonableness of

16

this test is an accommodation.

17

proposals entail a facial or initial cost, and that reason

18

is — cannot be enough in itself to find that proposal to

19

be non-negotiable.
QUESTION:

Many of the bargaining

MR. PERSINA:

3
4

I think the FLRA position on that

Well, Your Honor, I can think of

little to add beyond what I already have.
But I do think that many of the intangibles have

5
6

a tangible outlet and that we cannot separate the

7

intangible from the tangible because so often they will

8

relate.

9

at no time indicated that it is seeking an exact dollar

And, again, I would stress that the Authority has

10

and cent offset as an accounting certainty in order to

11

satisfy the test.

12

But I do think that the particulars of the

13

administration of the test, as far as how intangibles and

14

tangibles are married up by the Authority, is -- is one

15

that the Authority is entitled to develop through case law

16

as agency employers seek to comply with the test, which

17

this one and others have not done.

18

But the test -- to do otherwise, we think -- to

19

do otherwise in a compensating benefits analysis would

20

restrict the scope of bargaining so severely under the

21

statute that Congress could not have intended that.

22

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Persina, as I understand it, the

Authority puts the burden on the Federal employer to —

MR. PERSINA:

Is that right?
Well, yes, Your Honor.

The burden

is placed on the employer, and I think its properly

placed, at least as an initial matter, for two very good

11

reasons.

12

the right.

13

Number one, it is the employer who is asserting

Number two, it is the employer who knows best

And again, I come back to this sort of

So we don't think that the burden is

must show is that the benefits do not offset the costs.

QUESTION:

I would — I would stop hectoring you

on this if —if you would say that when the agency says

the agency means economic benefits do not outset the cost.

6

But you -- you cannot say that, can you?

7

MR. PERSINA:

Well, Your Honor, I cannot say

8

that the Authority has ever addressed whether it will look

at only economic benefits, or it will look at economic and

intangible benefits.

turn to the issue of Section 241 and the agency regulation

And

In other words, is this regulation the only-

regulation that can be written to be consistent with the

statute?

4

regulation is an exercise of discretion by this agency and

5

therefore cannot bar bargaining under the Federal Sector

Labor Statute.

7

And we submit that it clearly is not, that the

Even a cursory examination of Section 241

8

reveals that it does not require identity of compensation

9

between Section 6 schools and local schools.

Rather,

10

Section 241 sets two goals.

The first is of comparable

11

education quality to local schools, and the second is that

12

that education be provided at a comparable cost or

13

equivalent cost to local schools.

14

costs, I would stress.

Overall per-pupil

15

But it is clear that this section does not

16

restrict the discretion of how the agency goes about

17

meeting those bottom-line statutory goals.

18

241 these schools have the discretion to bargain on these

19

pay proposals and still to meet those goals.

20

Under Section

Schools can configure their costs over the

various aspects of providing an education in a variety of

could seek to teach math through -- in order to implement

First, with respect to the first issue as to

I'd like to make just a few points.

20

whether wages are negotiable conditions of employment, I

21

believe Justice White pointed out that it appears that the

22

FLRA's position is that Congress deliberately left wages

23

out of the — out of the statute.

24

of the employees couldn't bargain about wages, and so it

took wages out of the statute.

It knew that 97 percent

We think that rather than

would have to engraft wages into the statute to -- to

write an opinion going the other way.

issue, no one ever said on the floor of Congress that

employees, like these teachers, could bargain about pay.

7

With respect to the other statutes that have

8

been mentioned, not one of those makes wages negotiable

9

without saying wages are negotiable.

10

On the budget point, as I understand the

11

discussion that went on, the FLRA's position is not only

12

that intangibles might outweigh the costs but that --

13

QUESTION:

May I interrupt there, Mr. Wright?

14

It's true that is what they have argued today, but I'm not

15

sure their opinion in this case relies on the possibility

16

of intangible benefits.

17

I think one can say that in this case they said

18

that you failed in two respects.

19

tangible benefits and, two, that you didn't even show the

20

impact on the budget itself.

21

MR. WRIGHT:

One, that you don't show

Well, of course, our primary

22

argument is that weighing costs and benefits is the heart

23

of the budget-making process.

Well, that may be but -That Congress has reserved the

budget-making process —

2

QUESTION:

-- but don't you have to respond to

3

the argument that at least you've got to show that it has

4

a 50 cent impact on the budget?

5

that.

6

And you didn't even show

And we don't know it to be true simply because

7

its 13.5 percent because you might have prepared a budget

8

that considered the contingency of a 20 percent increase.

9

We don't know what your budget was.

10

MR. WRIGHT:

We -- we think that any -- any

11

proposal that calls into account the salaries of

12

(inaudible) schools --

13

QUESTION:

But what if you had previously

14

determined in your own budget that you'd sent to the

15

Commander-in-Chief of the Army, or whoever it would go to,

16

that you -- you think the union is going make an

17

outrageous demand because all the local schools have gone

18

up 20 percent, so we'd better budget for 20 percent, even

19

though we may not have to pay it?

20
21
22

MR. WRIGHT:

Well, our position is that salaries

are just -- are just off the negotiating table.
QUESTION:

That —

Well, I understand, but your -- and

23

your budget argument -- just confining it to the budget

24

argument, how can you could say on that hypothetical there

25

would be any impact on the budget?

MR. WRIGHT:

Well, in your example, Justice

Stevens, we've already — the Army has already lost

control of the budget process.

the negotiability, a demand that would be made --

QUESTION:

It's taken into account

But what if — no, say that it's not

negotiable.

policy they think these teachers ought to be increased

8

even more than the union later demanded, and they budgeted

9

that amount?

10

Suppose they just decided as a matter of

That's not impossible.

MR. WRIGHT:

It's not impossible.

Our position

11

is that opening the wages of teachers at schools to

12

negotiation, will -- will deprive the management of

control of the — of the school's budget.

Even if they ask for less than you

had budgeted?

Even in that unlikely event, which
