ORAL ARGUMENT OF JANET BENSHOOF

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS/CROSS-RESPONDENTS

11

MS. BENSHOOF:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case presents the constitutionality of a 1981

12

criminal Minnesota statute requiring both biological

13

parents to be notified prior to a minor's abortion.

14

issue here is not one of parental involvement.

15

of our case is the two-parent requirement which not only

16

is out of step with the reality of family life but which

17

tramples on the integrity of many families.

18

The

The heart

Because the statutory scheme was written in the

19

alternative, there are two statutory schemes before the

20

Court today.

21

requires that both biological parents be notified 48 hours

22

prior to any teenager's abortion.

23

requirement is imposed across-the-board regardless of

24

whether the minor lives in a no-parent, one-parent or

25

two-parent household, regardless of whether she is mature,

Subdivision 2, where we are the appellees,

1

or whether it would be in her best interest to have a

2

private abortion, regardless of whether she has ever met

3

the absent parent.

4

Under subdivision 2, no bypass option is possible

5

with this notice even when the minor, her natural parent

6

and her stepparent together agree that abortion is the

7

best choice and to notice to the absent family is likely

8

to be destructive to the family.

9

Subdivision 6, where we're the appellant, was in

10

effect for five years.

11

waiting period requirement but contains a judicial bypass.

12

After five weeks of trial and hearing the testimony of

13

some 57 witnesses, the trial court federal court judge in

14

Minnesota made comprehensive findings of fact as to the

15

impact and the operation of this law on minors, on medical

16

practice, on their privacy rights and on their families.

17
18
19
20

50 percent of minors in Minnesota who are seeking
abortions do not live with both biological parents.
QUESTION:

Was this all testified to at that trial,

Ms. Benshoof?

21

MS. BENSHOOF:

QUESTION:

23

It imposes the same notice and

Yes, it was,

It wasn't just studies or — but witnesses

got on the stand and said that?

MS. BENSHOOF:

Absolutely.

It undermined families that do exist and drove

I would first like to address subdivision 2, where we

are the appellees.

parents.

11

However, in Ashcroft, Akron and Bellotti, this Court

12

clearly held that an effective bypass mechanism had to be

13

held for any parental involvement requirement in order to

14

ensure that mature minors and best interest minors were

15

not forced to forego those privacy rights recognized in

16

Danforth.

17

This Court has consistently recognized both the

18

unique and the non-postponable nature of the abortion

19

decision, and the fact that imposition of unwanted

20

motherhood on a teenager is particularly devastating to

21

her future.

22

Danforth in which this Court said that any independent

23

right of the parent that may exist is no more weighty than

24

a minor's privacy right; and, in fact, even the dissent in

1

at some independent, completely right of the parent absent

2

any consideration of the welfare of the minor.

3

Apart from this right-to-know theory in this case,

4

this Court has never supported the idea of giving

5

fundamental due process rights to any sort of parent who's

6

never lived with the child, acknowledged the child,

7

supported the child, or whose abusive actions to the other

8

parent or the child are destructive.

9

This Court has been repeatedly skeptical of the

10

claims of absentee fathers.

11

unmarried father with no ongoing relationship with the

12

child, was not even entitled to notice of a pending

13

adoption.

14

QUESTION:

In Lehr, for example, an

Well, Ms. Benshoof, weren't — those were

15

claims where the absent father asserted a constitutional

16

claim —

17

MS. BENSHOOF:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

Yes —

— which we rejected.

We certainly didn't

say that the state couldn't recognize such an interest.
MS. BENSHOOF:

In this particular case, the State of

21

Minnesota is arguing that these parents have liberty

22

interests which the state has to promote or otherwise they

23

are in effect vetoed.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, but whether — whether or

not — they are — they are constitutional interests, the

1
2

state might choose to promote them, might it not?
MS. BENSHOOF:

Well, the state could promote

3

interests that are not constitutional interests, but then

4

they would be balanced against rights and constitutional

5

interests in the minor and, I might add, her single

6

mother, so that those rights would even be less cognizable

7

than if they would be liberty interests.

8
9

And I do agree that at — you know, biological
parents may have some degree of liberty interests, but

10

this Court has always looked at those interests along a

11

spectrum.

12

QUESTION:

But when the Court looks at those

13

interests, it's generally looking at them in terms of a

14

constitutional challenge.

15

li’berty interest, the absent parent, the single mother.

Someone is saying, I have a

But when the state comes to legislate, it doesn't

18

constitutional interests.

19

citizens as it sees them so long as it doesn't run up

20

against some other constitutional barrier, can't it?

21

MS. BENSHOOF:

It can protect interests of its

It absolutely can.

But in this

22

instance they are framing those in terms of rights and

23

constitutional interests of the parents that are more

24

weighty than the privacy interests of the minor at hand,

25

and they are saying that a bypass procedure, in effect,

1
2

cuts off those interests.
Even parents with recognized liberty interests don't

3

have a right to protective state legislation to impinge on

4

privacy interests balanced on the other side.

5

QUESTION:

How — how do you define the privacy

6

interest that the child has here in her nontraditional

7

family, say, with the stepfather and — and -- and a

8

natural mother apart from any interest she has in medical'

9

treatment?

10
11

What is her privacy interest that you're

protecting here, and what are the cases that you rely on? .
MS. BENSHOOF:

Well, there's two sorts of privacy

12

interests.

First of all, there is the privacy interest

13

recognized in Roe and Danforth that a mature minor and a

14

minor whose best interest it is has an interest

15

independent of her parents to be able to ineffectuate an

16

abortion decision.

17

QUESTION:

No, no.

18

MS. BENSHOOF:

19

QUESTION:

Quite — quite apart from that —

Apart from —

— because you began by saying

20

that — that this interferes with the ongoing family

21

relation.

22

MS. BENSHOOF:

Absolutely.

I think that the family

1

that situation, for example — and I think this example

2

illustrates your point — a named minor and her mother are

3

both plaintiffs in this suit where the father was

4

divorced, she lives in a family with a stepfather, the

5

natural father has held a gun to the mother's head several

6

times, and she only speaks to him with a policeman

7

present.

QUESTION:

8
9

Yet, the state —
Well, my — my question is what is the

definition of the privacy interest that you're asserting

10

here?

11

without disruption?

12
13

Is it an interest to live in a ■— a home without —

MS. -BENSHOOF:

It would be phrased, first of all, in

the —

14

QUESTION:

15

MS. BENSHOOF:

16

Is that how you phrase it?

Or can you be more specific than that?
— privacy interest to be able to

choose to have the abortion —

17

QUESTION:

No, quite apart from that.

18

MS. BENSHOOF:

19

QUESTION:

20

MS. BENSHOOF:

— then there would be —

Quite apart from that.
— a privacy interest in informational

21

privacy such as this Court recognized in Whalen v. Roe, a

22

private to make — to keep independent information

23

personal to oneself.

24
25

There's also the privacy interest in being able to
live in a new — in a family setting of your choosing,

1
2

which this Court recognized in Moore.
So, in essence, this Court doesn't even need to look

3

at the abortion cases to find that the rights of minors of

4

natural parents, of single parents, are violated in this

5

case by the state in forcing — in effect, forcing

6

unrelated adults to give very personal information, often

7

inflaming information, to each other.

8
9

Nothing in this statute forbids minors from
voluntarily telling one parent.

In fact, most do.

Single

10

parents under the statute are free to talk to ex-spouses.

11

This is not the doctor — the state coming in and cutting

12

out any rights.

13

In fact, nothing precludes a doctor from making an

14

independent judgment in this case that a particular minor

15

needs a parent or adult to be involved.

16

a specific statute which we mentioned in our brief which

17

provides that when a doctor sees a health need and he's

18

treating a minor for a confidential matter, he may inform

19

the parents if failure to do so would jeopardize the

20

minor's health.

Minnesota law has

situation, the minor and her single mother or the minor

2

and her parents may be living in.

3

In many instance we have divorced mothers as

4

plaintiffs where the divorce took place under very abusive

situations.

years to go to an ex-husband and reveal this personal

If they have the loving support of one

10

parent, often who has to under considerable trauma,

11

expense, go to a state court judge with that minor, there

The statute is very overbroad, in that it requires

have to ferret out and give this very, very personal

QUESTION:

We have even instances in

Ms. Benshoof, you appear to be arguing in

19

the brief that applying a compelling interest standard

20

would result in striking the two-parent requirement.

21

result would you reach under a rationality standard?

22

MS. BENSHOOF:

What

Well, Your Honor, I believe that when

23

minors' rights are at stake because, as this Court

24

recognized in Bellotti and I think Justice Stevens

25

particularly recognized in Carey, minors who are pregnant

1

need more protection from this Court than even in other

2

areas because they only have two options left in their

3

life at that point.

4

However, under any standard of review, this is

5

irrational.

6

scrutinized the factual record very carefully to show that

7

there was no fit between forbidding inmate marriages and

8

relating that to the penological concerns of the State of

9

Missouri.

10

For example, in Turner v. Safley, you

Moreover, in Castle v. Consolidated Freightways,

11

which was a 1981 case of this Court, there was a 14-day

12

trial, on the safety effects of banning 65-foot trailers in

13

Iowa, and you found that although there was some slight

14

safety benefit, there was not much and it didn't — it
*

15

wasn't reasonable or rational to require that ban because

16

of its burden on interstate commerce.

17

QUESTION:

That was a commerce clause context in

18

which we were not depriving the state of the authority to

19

legislate.

20

national government could — could regulate.

21

seems to me that's inapt.

22

We were just saying that the state or the

MS. BENSHOOF:

So I — it

I think that's very apt because

23

first of all we're not saying the state is deprived of

24

authority here, we're not disputing the legitimacy of the

25

state interest. -Certainly, parental involvement is a

1

laudable and beneficial goal.

What we have proved in this

2

case is that the means chosen not only don't achieve that

3

goal, but they undermine that goal; they undermine the

4

very thing the state wants to achieve.

5

And in Castle you did use a rational basis test.

6

If the test used on trucks in Iowa were applied to minor's

7

health rights, we would win this case.
The state argues that somehow notice is

8
9

different than consent; that somehow notice is less

10

burdensome than consent, and that's another reason why a

11

lesser standard of review should be used by this Court.

12

I would submit that the facts show the exact

13

opposite.

14

consent.

15

consent law versus a notice law, from the point of view of

16

minors, whose rights are at stake in this case, there is

17

no difference between them for three reasons.

18

That notice is not less burdensome than
While parents may perceive a difference in a

First — first of all, there's no difference

19

between notice and consent for the potential for provoking

20

obstruction and violence.

in Minnesota, making it the most prevalent violent crime

in the State of Minnesota.

always disastrous.

In fact, the only two expert witnesses

2

put on trial by the State of Minnesota admitted on cross-

3

examination that yes, it's true in these kinds of cases it

4

would not be beneficial, and yes, it's true, violence

5

could occur.
Now there's no reason to believe that parents

6

7

who would veto an abortion though — through threatened or

8

actual violence, would not equally obstruct a minor's

9

access to a clinic or a court after being notified.

10

In fact, that was precisely what this Court

11

recognized in Bellotti.

12

that the State of Massachusetts required you to be

13

notified — required parents to be notified before going

14

to court said, wait, minors must have the right to go to

15

court first and anonymously, because parents may block

16

access if — to the court itself if they were notified.

17

They said, in looking at the fact

So violent reactions, such as beating, being

18

thrown out the home, which are not uncommon, are

19

precipitated by the knowledge, not by whether the minor

20

says hey, wait a minute, I'm not asking for consent.

21

Second, the burden on informational privacy, the

22

having to give this very personal information to someone

23

who may be a stranger, both on mature minors and on their

24

single parents, is the same under a notice or consent

25

statute.

reasons for not to disclose a pregnancy for a second

5

had a father who just had a stroke whose father's doctor

said, do not tell him.

7

Yet the state wouldn't even give them a bypass; they would

8

force this father with his stroke to be told.

Several of our class members, and this
One

And her mother totally agreed.

Now it makes ho difference telling that father

9
10

with the stroke whether or not you're asking him for

11

consent or asking him to sign a form that yes, he has been

12

notified.

13

There is no difference whatsoever.
Finally, this Court's cases invalidating

14

parental notice were based on the right of mature minors

15

to decide not to become teenage mothers.

16

this case makes clear that a notice requirement imposed on

17

minors, and in this case nearly'half went through the

18

bypass, which was no easy task, but the notice requirement

19

itself is such a deterrent that it is an equal deterrent

20

to any form of consent.

21

And the trial in

Now the Defendants argue that while all of this

22

may very well be true, that — that there may be some

23

burdens imposed by a notice that — a 72-hour notice that

24

can extend into a week, and there may be some burdens

25

imposed by having to notify an absent parent who is in a

mental hospital, a fugitive to justice, dying, or beats

2

the family regularly, or is under an order of protection,

3

that may be true, but there is always the judicial bypass.

4

But I would submit that the district court was

5

correct in saying that a judicial bypass cannot immunize

6

the underlying notice requirement from judicial scrutiny.

7

Yes, it is necessary.

8

situations even in intact families where there is violence

9

occurring.

10

It is necessary because there are

And in fact, most of the — as the district

11

court found, many of the families which are violent

12

families, are intact families, there is a notice — a

13

reason for this bypass.

14

clearly overbroad because the bypass itself is burdensome.

15

And you can't just impose this burden without looking at

16

the notice.

17

But the two-parent requirement is

The bypass is burdensome because it takes minors

18

about an average of a week to go through the bypass in

19

Minnesota, which the district court judge found to be

20

medically significant.

21

And this is no small, matter for minors.

A week

22

increases the mortality risk about 50 percent.

23

this stretched into more than a week, and we have several

Although the Massachusetts statute in Bellotti,

two-parent consent, there was an exception in that for

MR. TUNHEIM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

16

The primary issue in this case is whether a

state can require a reasonably diligent effort to notify

the parents of an unemancipated minor 48 hours prior to

19

the performance of an abortion.

Justice, that parental notification is required in all

Now, decisions of this Court in five cases

is constitutional as to minors who claim to be mature or

Petitioners' claims.
The Petitioners are asking this court to

overturn decisions in Matheson, Bellotti II and Ashcroft.

They're asking this Court to significantly limit parents'

5

rights and responsibilities by finding that minors have

constitutional privacy rights as against their parents and

7

a right to withhold important information from parents.

8
9

Petitioners in effect are asking this court to
second-guess a state legislature that has made a

10

reasonable value judgment that it is beneficial for

11

parents to know when minor daughters are pregnant and

12

seeking an abortion, that parents can in effect be very

13

helpful to minors during a time of serious trauma.

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Tunheim, the statute with

15

its absolute two-parent notice requirement does sweep

16

broadly and pick up some cases, does it not, where a

parent would have to be notified even though possibly that

parent had been denied custody of the child because the

19

court had found that it was not in the best interests of

the child?

difficult time in her life.
A custodial proceeding does not determine that a
parent is not fit to — to be a parent.

It's still —

that person is still a parent with significant rights and
responsibilities, and there's no reason for a presumption
that that parent would not act in the best interests of
the minor if notified.
QUESTION:

Mr. Tunheim, I — I had assumed that

the purpose of this provision — I mean, maybe — maybe
you will tell me otherwise, but I had assumed that its
purpose was not just to — to assist the child, but that
the legislature also thought that apart from whether it
would do the child good or not, the biological parents
were presumed to have the right to provide advice on this
matter if they — if they wanted to to the child.

that, in order to avoid notification, a minor declare that

she is a victim of sexual abuse or physical abuse or

QUESTION:

No, I'm saying that custody has been

taken away from the parent because the parent is unfit and

constitutional right to require the minor to notify that

The law merely postpones

Now, I submit that this Court has not equated

that is confirmed by a footnote in the Matheson case,

question?

QUESTION:

Yes.

Going back to your dialogue with

6

Justice Scalia earlier, just focusing simply on the

7

parental interest in knowing what's happening to the child

as one of the justifications for the two-parent

9

requirement, does Minnesota vindicate that interest in any

10
11

other statute?
MR. TUNHEIM:

Justice Stevens, there are other

12

statutes which require notice to both parents, a sta-tute

13

that requires notice to both parents when a minor seeks a

14

name change, so there's one instance of an indication in

15

which notice is required to both parents.

QUESTION:

How about Minnesota as compared to

17

Ohio, in the area of drug treatment, sexually transmitted

diseases and things of that character?

MR. TUNHEIM:

kinds of medical treatment.

question, I submit that the abortion situation is

2

different and states are entitled to treat abortion

3

differently.

4

There, the issue is a decision whether or not to

5

undergo elective surgery that is not medically indicated

6

for any particular reason, and the state's interest there

7

does not lie in getting the minor in to get treatment,

8

like it might in the drug abuse area, but the state

9

interest there is in a thoughtful and informed decision on

10
11

the part of the minor.
This Court has indicated many times that

12

abortion is different and unique and states may come up

13

with different rules to treat it differently.

14

Now, going back to the issue of claims raised by

15

petitioners, I submit that the record in this case does

16

not undercut in any respect the longstanding cardinal

17

premise that parents generally act in their childrens'

18

best interests.

19

The record does show that minors and parents

20

don't always agree.

21

don't like to tell their parents unpleasant facts, and the

record shows that parents often react normally with —

Mr. — Mr. Tunhelm, what is the point

of a record in a case such as this?

4

legislature may have taken into consideration in passing a

statute?

MR. TUNHEIM:

Do trial courts

I submit, Mr. Chief Justice, that

7

that is not the appropriate role of a trial court in a

8

case like this.

9
10

But what —

QUESTION:

Why did the trial court here do it,

do you know?
MR. TUNHEIM:

11

Well, I'm not — I'm not entirely

12

clear, Your Honor.

asking is that this Court reassess the factual premises

14

that underlie the Matheson, Bellotti II and Ashcroft

decisions.

statute that had a bypass in effect, which would enable

2

minors to entirely avoid those two particular

requirements.
I submit that the record in this case shows

absolutely no tangible threat to the health of the minor

as a result of this law.

7

failed to demonstrate that any minor suffered abuse or

8

obstruction as a result of this law, that any minor

suffered any medical harm as a result of this law, that

kind of statistically significant risk or that minors were

And none of

And I'd ask this Court to reaffirm that states

2

3

are entitled to rely upon the premises underlying

4

well-settled law of this Court as interpreted by this

5

Court, when they enact important legislation.

6

Now, let me address briefly the issue of what

7

the district court found as — as to the purposes of the

8

law.
The district court found in — in finding of

9
10

fact number 67, as a factual matter, that the state had

11

not proved that the law serves state interest in fostering

12

family communications and protecting pregnant minors; not

13

that the law didn't serve its purposes, but the state had

14

not proved that the law didn't serve its purposes.

15

I submit that this is not a factual finding, but

16

a conclusion of law, or, at — at the very least, a mixed

17

finding of law and fact that's due no deference by this

18

Court.
And I submit that it is not the state's

19
20

obligation to reprove the factual premises of strongly

21

established constitutional law, especially in a case in

22

which there is a summary judgment order which recognizes

23

that this Court has concluded that such a law serves state

24

purposes.

25

1

II case leaves little doubt about the question.

2

said that there can be little doubt that states further a

3

constitutionally permissible end by encouraging an

4

unmarried pregnant minor to seek the help and advice of

5

her parents in making the very important decision whether

6

or not to bear a child.

7

QUESTION:

The Court

Yes, but isn't — isn't it true that

8

the district court did say that although that's a —

9

that's a legitimate purpose and a — and a — a worthwhile

10

goal, that in some situations this statute actually

11

disserves that goal because there will be cases in which

12

the minor is willing to tell one parent if that's going to

13

be the end of the situation, but not to tell both.

14

the requirement of telling both will cause the child not

15

to tell either, and therefore, that in some situations,

16

the statute is counterproductive, and that the state

17

didn't sustain the burden of overcoming that — proof to

18

that effect?

19

MR. TUNHEIM:

And

I submit, Justice Stevens, that

20

that particular finding simply doesn't make any sense.

21

a minor is predisposed to — to tell — voluntarily tell

22

one parent of her desire to have an abortion, and — and

23

then obviously does not want to tell the other parent, so

24

it goes through the court bypass procedure, why — why

25

would — after — after going through the court bypass

QUESTION:

That — that there is — that she has one parent

Well, maybe she doesn't want to go

6

MR. TUNHEIM:

7

QUESTION:

Pardon?

Maybe she doesn't want to go through

8

the bypass procedure.

She's willing to tell one parent,

9

provided that that's the end of the matter.

But if

10

telling one parent will merely require her to go to court

11

anyway, perhaps she'd tell — tell neither.

12

that's the thrust of the finding.

13

MR. TUNHEIM:

14

I think

That — that's correct, Your

Honor.

15

Let me just point out though, Your Honors, that

16

the — the finding as to the purpose of the law is plainly

17

incorrect.

18

recognized by this Court, is to increase the potential for

19

communication between parents and children at a critical

20

time.

21

doubling of parents who were notified during the time that

22

the law was in effect.

The Webster case teaches us that the legitimate

24

purposes of a law are not undercut if the law is not

always helpful in every — every situation.

And I submit also that the finding does not

1
2

contradict the conclusion that a — that notice is

3

reasonably designed to serve state interests.

4

demonstrates what happens when you — when a court goes

5

beyond such an inquiry to weigh the costs and benefits of

6

legislation.
The Eighth Circuit rejected that finding and —

7
8

The finding

and so should this Court.
Now, with respect to mature and best-interest

9
10

minors.

As I have indicated, this Court has not yet

11

decided the issue of whether a notice law requires a

12

bypass as it applies to mature and best-interest minors.

13

And I submit that since a notice law imposes no

14

such veto, that a bypass is not constitutionally mandated

15

for any category.

16

Minnesota law does provide, however, certain significant

17

exceptions for minors that the legislature has deemed

18

mature.

19

And I will point out again that

For — with respect to mature minors, the law

20

provides an exception for emancipated minors.

No notice

21

is required for that category.

22

however, have noted that even mature minors can benefit

23

from parental advice and support.

24

Court have also recognized that mature minors are better

25

able to resist the pressure that a parent can put on.

Members of this Court,

And members of the

40

SUITE 400

1

And the Court has also recognized that the

2

legislature — legislatures can set chronological ages

3

which may be imprecise.

4

Now, with respect to the best-interest category,

5

as I indicated earlier, there is a broad exception for

6

abuse victims.

7

of parents eventually finding out about a report of

8

suspected abuse, there exists that possibility, but under

9

no situation could that occur until after the abortion

10
11

And to get back to the issue of parents —

takes place.
I remind the Court that under Minnesota law, the

12

source of the report is confidential, and the — the —

13

the notification of parents, if it does occur, is — is a

14

decision that — that can be made by child protection

15

authorities, and they may withhold knowledge — may

16

withhold that notification if they feel that would be in

17

the best interest of the child in the situation.

18

MR. TUNHEIM:

There's also a — a — an

19

emergency exception in the law which allows an abortion to

20

take place where it is necessary to prevent the death of

21

the mother.

22

If the Court somehow believes that — that

23

notice is more burdensome to a mature and best-interest

24

minor, I would point out that the legislature has exempted

25

those with truly compelling needs.

Now, with respect briefly to the waiting period

1
2

of 48 hours, there is a significant state interest in a

3

reasonable waiting period following the notification.

4

provides an opportunity for a parent to react to the

5

notice, for the parent to communicate with the minor, and

6

for the minor to reflect upon that communication.

7

there is no reason shown in this record or elsewhere why

8

48 hours is not a reasonably — reasonable time to — to

9

wait following the notification, especially in situations

It

And

10

such as — as Minnesota, where parents may live in

11

outlying communities and may receive the notice of the

12

abortion after the minor has left for a metropolitan area

13

to have the abortion take place.

14
15
16

And with respect to the burden of a waiting
period —
QUESTION:

Well, isn't — isn't that true in

17

almost every other state?

18

in Virginia and Maryland.

19

MR. TUNHEIM:

We have rural areas in — even

Certainly, Your Honor.

That —

20

that's true.

21

abortions are provided only in the metropolitan areas of

22

Minneapolis, St. Paul and Duluth, and it — it takes some

23

period of time to travel to those areas at times, and I

24

suspect that that's the situation in most states.

25

In Minnesota, the evidence suggests that

The district court somehow viewed the 48-hour

1

waiting period as causing a possibility of a delay of —

2

of more than one week.

3

What the court, however, failed to recognize, is

4

that the waiting period can start simply by a phone call

5

to an abortion provider and that it can run concurrently

6

with any other delay that might be imposed on the process.

7

And, as a matter of fact, the scheduling

8

practices of the providers suggests that most abortions

9

will not take place immediately, but generally it takes

10
11

two or three days before the — the abortion is scheduled.
QUESTION:

May I ask you, what is — what does

12

the statute provide with respect to the identity of the

13

person who must give the notice?

14

MR. TUNHEIM:

Justice Stevens, notice is

15

provided under the Minnesota law by either the physician

16

or an agent of the physician.

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Is it required to be in-person or by

telephone or can it be written notice?
MR. TUNHEIM:

It can be written notice.

It can

20

be — it can be personal delivery of the notice, or it can

21

be mailed delivery with the presumption.

22

QUESTION:

So, if the — if the pregnant minor

23

makes an appointment at the same time the clinic could

24

send a notice out while the appointment is being

25

scheduled, so you — you in effect don't waste — don't

2

have two successive time periods involved?
MR. TUNHEIM:

That's correct, Justice Stevens,

3

and, in fact, the law includes a presumption that — that

4

the delivery is mailed and received at noon on the day

5

following delivery.

6

of delivery.

So, there's a conclusive presumption

7

In concluding, Your Honor, I'd like to urge this

8

Court to find that Minnesota's notification law represents

9

an appropriate and constitutional balance., among

10

significant state interests in parental communication, in

11

parents' rights and responsibilities and minors' interests

12

in choosing an abortion.

Thank you very much.

1

What we are objecting to here are the means and

2

what we had the trial on are whether the particular means,

3

this particular statute drafted by the legislature in

4

Minnesota, achieves the goals and what the district court

5

found in very arduous and careful fact-finding was not

6

only they were not achieved, but that they were

7

undermined.

8
9

QUESTION:

But is that an ordinary thing you

would expect a district court to do, to hold a factual

trial on whether a statute "achieves" the goals that the

legislature set out to achieve?

12

heard of that.

13

MS. BENSHOOF:

I — I frankly never

Absolutely.

For — I think this

Court in many cases — I think the whole basis of

constitutional review is whether or not there's a fit

between the articulated purposes and the — and whether or

not those purposes are achieved.

QUESTION:

Well, did —

MS. BENSHOOF:

In Craig v. Boren you looked as

to whether the differential between men and women

contributed to highway safety.

22

Certainly in Buckley v. Valeo you pointed out

that you're upholding the campaign financing laws, but

should we come back later and show that minor parties are,

1

But that — that was a — that was a

2

First Amendment case.

I mean, where — where you — where

3

there may be a different rule, in the ordinary case do you

4

think the legislature is simply subject to being second-

5

guessed on the facts by a trial in the district court?
MS. BENSHOOF:

6

Well, certainly the legislature

7

of the state of Iowa was second-guessed on a 65-foot

8

truck.
QUESTION:

9
10

our Court as to whether that should have been done.

11

Well, there was some dispute within

16

MS. BENSHOOF:

18

MS. BENSHOOF:

I'm sorry you weren't on my side.

But I'm citing the majority.

In response to Justice Stevens'

19

question about abortion being different, I'd like to point

20

out that, yes, you've allowed abortion to be treated

21

differently, but never have you not looked at all the

22

state interests to see whether this really is a state

23

interest.

24
25

For example, in Griswold, you said is the state
really protecting marital fidelity?

Let's look at their

other statutes.
Justice White, in his dissent in Michael H.,

2

3

said is this really protecting against the stigma of

4

illegitimacy?

5

raise it.

6

Let's look at the fact that a father can

Well, in Minnesota, are they really protecting

7

the parents' rights to help a child when they let — they

8

have specific minors' consent to health care where minors

9

can have complete privacy in pregnancy testing, V.D.

10

testing and treatment, penicillin, which is more dangerous

11

than an abortion, prenatal care, childbirth — you can

12

consent to a cesarean section at age 14 in Minnesota, and

13

yet you have to notify a father you may never have seen.

14

I would not say that you have to treat abortion

15

differently because that's not what this Court has said,

16

but certainly the strength and integrity of the state

17

interest in this case I would submit is a bit suspect.

18

And going to the emergency exception, there

19

really is no emergency exception in this statute for

20

health problems.

21

One class member that we represent, for example,

22

was aborting spontaneously.

problem with her mother.

because they could not notify the absent father, and they

Certainly that doesn't

Fourth, I think —

5

QUESTION:

Your opponent said the emergency was

6

confined to the possible death of the mother.

7

true?
MS. BENSHOOF:

8
9

Emergency is not only

confined to death, but you have to die within three days.

10

(Laughter.)

11

QUESTION:

12

Yes.

Is that

And so there's nothing there as to

.the health of ' the mother?
MS. BENSHOOF:

13

Absolutely not, and death has to

14

be within three days.

15

minors who have dead parents are burdened under this

16

statute because this statute requires in its penalty

17

provision that the clinics collect written proof, so you

18

have to bring in funeral certificates or death

19

certificates which take for some of our minors — it's in

20

the record — two or three weeks.

QUESTION:

So that moreover, even — even

— it's not going to be at risk by the notification.

7

I mean, if — if you don't — you don't need the

MS. BENSHOOF:

Well, I think the point is that

8

that exception was never used when this statute was in

9

effect for five years, but certainly the health exception,

10

I think, is a more ordinary exception, particularly when

11

one parent comes in.

12

And minors do have health problems.

I think what we have to remember here is that

13

for a young person childbirth, for example, for a girl

14

under the age 15, is ten times as risky as death as for a

woman in her twenties.
