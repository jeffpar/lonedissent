MR. MARWEDEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

^

We'll hear argument

In September of 1985 the Petitioner was doing

11

what all sailors have to do, performing maintenance on his

12

boat.

13

maritime activity, in a navigable waterway Michigan -- in

14

Michigan City, Indiana, at a pleasure boating dock.

15
16

His boat was docked, what we regard a traditional

QUESTION:

Was this a kind of a marina, or was

it just a single dock?

17

MR. MARWEDEL:

It's a marina that is in part of

18

the harbor of Michigan City.

19

the harbor — it used to be a commercial harbor, part of

20

it now has municipal docks operated as a marina for

21

pleasure craft, six-pack fishing boats, that sort of

22

thing.

23

QUESTION:

MR. MARWEDEL:

Commercial fishing boats?

4

that sort of thing.

Not in the sense

5

That night a fire broke out on the boat, which

6

has been classified as one of the main perils of a boat,

7

and it totally destroyed Mr. Sisson's yacht and did

8

considerable damage to other yachts, as well as to marina

9

property.

12

13

A limitation of liability petition was filed in

the U.S. District Court in Chicago -QUESTION:

Now, when you use the term yacht, Mr.

Marwedel, do you mean something fairly specific?
MR. MARWEDEL:

It is a 56-foot Hatteras inboard,

14

twin screw motor yacht, which can be used for cruising

15

throughout the Great Lakes.

16

QUESTION:

And when you say other, it damaged

17

other yachts, you mean boats of similar size, or much

18

smaller size?

19

MR. MARWEDEL:

Yes.

In fact the petitioner's -

20

- or the respondents' yacht was of similar size.

21

were some smaller yachts, sailboats, everything from

22

another 56-foot yacht to a small sailboat.

QUESTION:

There

What is the difference between a

yacht and a sailboat?
MR. MARWEDEL:

Well, they are all yachts.

QUESTION:

So, how do we, very briefly, define a

yacht?
MR. MARWEDEL:

Well, I think a yacht -- well, I

5

am a sailor, and generally we refer to a yacht as

6

something over 26 feet.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. MARWEDEL:

9
10

Over 26 feet.
There is no rule, but it's just a

term we use.
The district court dismissed the petition for

11

limitation of liability on the grounds there was no

12

subject matter admiralty jurisdiction.

13

The admiralty jurisdiction of the United States

14

courts is derived from Article 3 of the Constitution and

15

the judicial power.

16

admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.

17

terms are used synonymously, but in past times, in

18

colonial times and in European times, the admiralty law

19

generally dealt with just the sea, the navigable waters.

20

The maritime law dealt with matters of contract, maritime

21

liens, finance, that sort of thing.

22

combined in Article 3 into one judicial power.

23

It confers on the courts the

test.

If the — if the accident took place, or the tort

2

took place on a navigable waterway, it has since been

3

extended to the Great Lakes, the western rivers, then you

4

had admiralty jurisdiction.
This Court had a problem with that -- with that

5
6

test the way it had been described in Executive Jet, where

7

a small commercial aircraft, in taking off, struck some

8

birds, essentially crashed and skidded into the water.

9

The owners of the aircraft sued the airport under

10

admiralty jurisdiction.

We believe that the Court rightly

11

ruled there was no admiralty jurisdiction.

12

that we think should have been used is there was no vessel

13

involved.

14

If you review the tort cases in the first 180

15

years of admiralty jurisdiction, the facts disclose you

16

have a vessel involved.

17

not just the navigable water.

MR. MARWEDEL:

It takes both.

And

Is a sea plane a vessel?
It can be, and under the rules of

21

the road, if a sea plane is operating on the water as a

22

vessel it must comply with the rules of a vessel.

the same navigation lights, it must follow the same rules

U.S. Code 1 U.S.C. Section 3 describes a vessel as a water

9

craft or other contrivance used or capable of being used

10

as a means of transportation on the water.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. MARWEDEL:

Does that go right down to a rowboat?
It could.

There are obviously

13

situations that you will get to where you will question.

14

A rowboat is -- may be — questionable.

15

a rowboat, and there are -- a rowboat has to follow the

MR. MARWEDEL:

The way the courts have construed

admiralty jurisdiction, no, it would not.

QUESTION:

8

MR. MARWEDEL:

9

Now is that

Why not?
Because it is water that is

solely with the boundaries of the state.

It is not

10

connected with interstate transportation.

11

think the judicial power could extend that far if the

12

Court wanted to.

13

but I think the judicial power for admiralty is different

14

from the commerce power, or the commerce clause.

15

the Court saw fit to extent it, it could.

16

Government, in enacting the Recreational Boating Act, has

17

regulations for the operation of boats and for safety

18

equipment of boats, and it just says water in the statute.

19

It doesn't restrict it to navigable waters.

admiralty courts?

2

MR. MARWEDEL:

3

QUESTION:

You don't have to.

I was sort of with you up until the

4

time where you expressed doubt about a rowboat.

5

wouldn't a rowboat be a vessel?

6

you hesitate.

7

MR. MARWEDEL:

Why

I don't understand why

Well, you get to a point -- you

8

get to a point in -- in -- in these types of craft where

9

you can get to a personal flotation device.

Now, a

10

rowboat I don't have a problem with.

11

maybe a styrofoam raft that has a couple of oars on it.

12

would consider that to be a personal flotation device, the

13

way a life jacket would be — or water wings.

14

QUESTION:

Then you get to

But you said a moment ago, I thought,

15

that even an outboard on a rowboat on an inland lake is

not admiralty jurisdiction.

I

It doesn't depend on the -- it is a

vessel, but it is not on navigable water?
MR. MARWEDEL:

21

Correct.

I -- I contend that you

22

need both.

You need a navigable water -- for the

23

traditional maritime activity that has been exercised by

24

this Court, you need a navigable waterway and you need a

25

vessel.

You need those two things.

QUESTION:

And if it is navigable and you have a

2

smaller craft, say an outboard motor or a small cruiser,

3

maybe 12-14 feet long, and they are pulling a water skier

4

and they run into another water skier, and there is

serious personal injury, would the — under your theory

6

would the liability limitation act apply?

7

MR. MARWEDEL:

QUESTION:

9
10

The limitation of --

So that the injured skier's recovery

is limited to the value of the vessel?
MR. MARWEDEL:

The limitation act is slightly

11

different from the general maritime, because it — nowhere

12

in that statute does it require a navigable water.

13

QUESTION:

Well, under your -- under your

14

theory, what would be the result of my case?

theory you are arguing here.

The water skier would not be.
And so the only person driving was

19

the owner of the vessel, and he injured somebody else that

20

was water skiing, the Limitation of Liability Act would

21

apply under your submission?

22

MR. MARWEDEL:

It would apply.

He would have

23

his chance in court, although I would admit that if he is

24

driving the boat and there was an error on his part, there

25

would be very little chance of his prevailing on his

MR. MARWEDEL:

Yes.

And this applies whether the accident

7

occurs on an inland lake or not?

8

MR. MARWEDEL:

9

QUESTION:

Because --

Well, thus far --

-- because the government says not.

10

The government says that your theory produces different

11

results, as I recall, depending upon whether the water

12

skier is on the Mississippi River or on some land-locked -

13

- land-locked lake in Wisconsin.

14

MR. MARWEDEL:

We are not contending, for the

15

purposes of our case, that the limitation act does apply

16

in an inland lake.

17

no language in the statute that restricts it to navigable

18

waters.

So that if the vessel is worth

to prevail.

for the vessel owner to prevail —

I'm saying that it would be very difficult

QUESTION:

MR. MARWEDEL:

Why?
— where he is driving the boat.

For example, if the vessel owner makes a sharp turn,

causing the water skier to have an accident, so that it's

19

operational negligence on behalf of the owner, who is the

20

operator as well, under the provisions of the limitation

act he couldn't limit, because he has privity and

knowledge of the proximate cause of the accident.

- some other reason that was not within his privity and

knowledge, for example he is going along in clear open

So that the injured

Mr. Marwedel, if we were looking just

6

at Section 1333 and the question of the admiralty

jurisdiction of the courts, without regard for the moment

8

to whether the Limitation of Liability Act enlarges at all

9

that jurisdiction, is a traditional maritime activity also

10

required, do you suppose, for jurisdiction?
MR. MARWEDEL:

This was first articulated in the

Executive Jet decision and then again in the Foremost

13

decision.

Well, I think the Seventh Circuit

9

would hold that if this vessel were a commercial vessel

10

and was tied up at a dock and had this fire, that there

11

would be admiralty jurisdiction.

12

MR. MARWEDEL:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

And yet, because this is not a

14

commercial vessel, it -- it is not within -- admiralty

15

jurisdiction.

16

MR. MARWEDEL:

Basically that is correct.

17

this Court in Foremost indicated that the commercial

18

activity of the vessel wasn't the test.

19

jurisdiction of the admiralty courts in colonial times was

20

to control the water, whatever moved on the water.

-- to look at just a commercial nexus, you would have to

look at what is going on in this vessel.

case, if I understand it correctly, however, that it

MR. MARWEDEL:

MR. KOPKA:

I represent the respondent.

what Petitioner is seeking to do is to limit his liability

for $275,000 worth of damage to $800.

And

But what counsel would urge this Court to do is

1
2

to allow application of the Limitation of Liability Act

3

even on non-navigable waterways, such as inland lakes.

4

And by doing so, under counsel's argument, there would be

5

admiralty jurisdiction to every body of water,

6

notwithstanding the fact that it is navigable or non-

7

navigable, by virtue of the Limitation of Liability Act.

8

This wasn't the intent of Congress in drafting the

9

Limitation of Liability Act.

In fact, this Court early on

10

stated that the Limitation of Liability Act is a part of

11

the general maritime laws.

12

And it is our position that the requirements of

13

general admiralty jurisdiction should be applied to the

14

Limitation of Liability Act, just as it's applied to every

15

other general admiralty case coming before the Federal

16

courts.

17

And the reason for that is because the admiral -

18

- admiralty courts of the United States have a certain

19

expertise and interest in matters which are strictly

20

admiralty.

21

is that with a proliferation of pleasure craft upon the

22

waterways, the Federal courts are being confronted with

common law, garden variety tort cases which have nothing

to do with the traditional maritime activity which this

Would there be any principled basis

3

for our giving a more restrictive application to the

Limitation of Liability Act than to the jurisdictional

6

MR. KOPKA:

No.

I think that the jurisdictional

aspects are the same.

should apply similarly.

In other words, the Limitation of

asked of us to brief was the issue of the case of

Richardson v. Harmon.

14

there are no cases which would be disturbed by counsel's

15

vessel test, and I point out that In re Phenix, the case

16

preceding Richardson v. Harmon, indeed involved a vessel,

17

and yet this Supreme Court found that there was no

18

admiralty jurisdiction at that time.

19

Counsel mentioned, by the way, that

We believe that the Richardson case does not

20

hold broadly that there is a separate species of admiralty

21

jurisdiction under the Limitation of Liability Act.

22

believe that if the Supreme Court in Richardson had

intended a separate species or a separate vehicle to

obtain jurisdiction through the Federal courts it would

have said so.

It did not.

has been codified in the Extension of Admiralty Act.

13

However, I would like to address the possibility that this

this Court does construe Richardson to supply a vehicle

16

for Federal admiralty jurisdiction, even when the other

requirements of Federal jurisdiction are absent, meaning

today that there is no navigable water location, or that

None in the record.

point, which is that a pleasure yacht may have an impact

upon commercial activity if it is — even if it is docked.

5

And my response to that is as follows.

of this Court in Executive Jet and in Foremost, and the

Sisson decision of the Seventh Circuit, instructs the

meaning the vessel where the fire started, or the vessel

which causes the collision, or the vessel which — on

And by focusing upon the wrong, we recognize

that the purpose of Federal case law is to affect the

conduct of parties engaged in everyday activities, for

commercial activity, although it is not in navigation,

19

there would be no Federal interest in the conduct of that

effect upon commercial navigation, so that there would be

If the pleasure craft which is

this Court's decisions in Executive Jet and Foremost.

12

the reasons for the addition of this, what we call the

MR. KOPKA:

And --

It is -- this is a modern creation

9

which this Court invented in 1973, but I will, if I may be

10

permitted an anecdote, I was at Mount Vernon yesterday and

11

I was standing where George Washington's porch is, and I

12

saw literally hundreds of pleasure craft.

13

recognized that George Washington couldn't have seen

14

anything like that in his day.

15

My suggestion is that, and the statistics which

16

we supplied in our brief suggest, that at the turn of this

17

century there weren't more than 1,000 pleasure craft in

18

these United States, whereas in 1987 there were estimated

19

to be 17 million pleasure craft upon the United States.

20

You are correct that the second test, in my
suggestion, would not apply.

However, the first test,

that a commercial maritime activity may be impacted, would
permit Federal admiralty jurisdiction in that scenario.
The scenario where Federal admiralty
jurisdiction would not be permitted is where the dock had
only pleasure craft or pleasure craft which were not
involved in maritime commercial activity and did not
involve navigation.
With five minutes remaining, I would like to
address the other issue, which is the question of whether
Foremost -- pardon me, whether Richardson v. Harmon
provides a separate species of Federal admiralty
jurisdiction, as is suggested by the petitioner.
Petitioner would have this Court read Foremost to apply
Federal admiralty jurisdiction even when the tests that we
have been discussing, the situs test and the nexus test,
are absent.
And there is no basis, either in the law or in
the Constitution, for applying Federal admiralty
jurisdiction pursuant to the Limitation of Liability Act.
There is nothing in the Limitation of Liability Act which
provides a separate basis of Federal jurisdiction.

There

is nothing in the Section 189, the amendment to the
Limitation of Liability Act, which provides a separate

And Richardson v. Harmon, to the extent that it

is construed to provide such a basis, is out of step with

4

the other cases of this Court, such as In re Phenix and

5

the Foremost case.

any cause of action under the Limitation of Liability Act,
