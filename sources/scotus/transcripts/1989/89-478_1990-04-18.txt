We'll hear argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. JOSEPH CURRAN, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. CURRAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.
The issue before the Court this morning is:

12

Sandra Craig denied her right of confrontation when our

13

trial judge allowed four child victim witnesses, aged

14

four, five and six, to testify at the trial by way of a

15

one-way closed circuit television, a procedure that had

16

been authorized by the Maryland statute?

Was

s/

17

Or was the right to confront satisfied because

18

the children, who were determined to be functionally

19

unavailable, testified under oath, were the subject of

20

unrestricted cross-examination and were able to be seen by

21

the judge and the jury on the monitors as to their

22

credibility and reliability?

23
24
25

Permit me, if I might, share with you the facts
in our case.
In the fall of 1986 Mrs. Craig was charged with

several counts — several instances of sexual and physical

2

child abuse.

3

trial court held a two-day motion hearing on whether or

4

not the section of our statute should be implemented

5

permitting the use of the one-way closed circuit

6

television.

Prior to the trial, in March of 1987, the

7

At that two-day hearing, five separate experts

8

were called who testified in child-specific detail as to

9

their recommendations and their opinions as to whether the

10

children would be able to testify in the presence of the

11

defendant, or whether they would be better able to testify

12

out of the presence of the defendant, by way of our

13

procedure.

14
15

QUESTION:

But each — each psychiatrist just

testified about a single child or —

16

MR. CURRAN:

No, Justice, there were five

17

different experts.

18

psychologists, child therapists —
QUESTION:

19
20

And I might add there were

But did they all testify about all

the children?
MR. CURRAN:

21

No, sir, only those children that

22

they had under therapy for several weeks ■— several

23

months.

24
25

QUESTION:

So it sounds like there was only one

— one expert for each child, is that it?

MR. CURRAN:

Well, in truth, one expert had

2

three children.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. CURRAN:

5

Another had two.

And the others

had, as I recall, one each.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. CURRAN:

8

QUESTION:

9

Okay.

All right.

Thank you.

But no one had — had everyone.
General Curran, I thought that the --

the trial court finding was made in accordance with the

10

language of the statute in Maryland, that the testimony of

11

each of the children in a courtroom would result in the

12

child suffering serious emotional distress, and that the

13

children could not reasonably communicate in a courtroom?

14

Now that was the finding that was made?

15

MR. CURRAN:

16

QUESTION:

That is correct, Justice O'Connor.
All right.

Now, is — is it

17

necessary that the focus be on whether the children could

18

testify in the presence of the defendant?

19

MR. CURRAN:

In truth, Justice O'Connor, if you

20

will review the joint appendix, you will find that each of

21

the five experts, when testifying about their respective

22

child patient, testified with specificity that it was the

23

presence of Mrs. Craig that they were seriously

24

emotionally distressed by.

25

QUESTION:

Well, that may well be, but was that

the finding of the trial court?

2

MR. CURRAN:

V
The trial court, Justice, as you

3

rightly observe, did in fact track the exact words of the

4

statute —

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. CURRAN:

Yes.
— and found that the children

7

testifying in the courtroom were deemed by (inaudible) to

8

be seriously emotionally distressed.

9

QUESTION:

There may well have been evidence in

10

the record that would have permitted the trial judge to

11

make a different finding, but it's not the finding the

12

trial judge made, is it?

13
14

MR. CURRAN:
O'Connor.

15
16

But I want to emphasize —
QUESTION:

Does that mean we must affirm the

judgment?

17
18

I conclude you are right, Justice

MR. CURRAN:

No, but I — yes.

don't want to affirm the judgment.

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. CURRAN:

No — no, I

No, excuse me.

I want to invite you to review the

21

entire testimony of all of the experts, both on direct and

22

cross —

QUESTION:

Well, but you don't want us to make

24

that finding, that the trial court should have made, do

you?

1

MR. CURRAN:

Well, I suggest to you, Justice

2

O'Connor, that the trial judge conclusion was based solely

3

on the testimony of the experts that talked solely about

4

Mrs. Craig, and not about the courtroom.

5

QUESTION:

Now, the court below ordered a new

6

trial.

7

might have sent it back to the trial court to consider

8

whether the trial court would make a different finding?

9

Do you think that the court, under Maryland law,

MR. CURRAN:

That is not necessary in our

10

opinion.

11

the court below made a misreading of your decision in Coy,

12

requiring, in their belief, that Coy, before permitting

13

our Section 9102 to be implemented, would require that

14

there be a face-to-face confrontation between the victim

15

and the defendant, either in person or by the two-way

16

television, before you could use that procedure.

17

We — we believe, and state in our brief, that

We disagree.

We — we believe very strongly

18

that the court below has simply misread your finding in

19

Coy.

20

QUESTION:

Was the defense objection simply to

21

not having the child in the courtroom, or did the defense

22

make the supplemental objection that it wanted the child

23

at least present in the videotaped room -- in the

24

videotaping room?

continuing, I will tell you, Justice Kennedy, was that the

2

children, out of the presence of the defendant, violated

3

her Sixth Amendment right to confront the accuser.

4

And our procedure, once the court heard from the

5

expert witnesses, permitted the children to be seen out of

6

the courtroom in the judge's chambers, and I'll just share

7

with you briefly the procedure, in the judge's chambers

8

was the child witness, was the prosecutor, was the defense

9

attorney, who was permitted to do all the cross-

10

examination that was desired, and of course the TV

11

technician person.

12

Out in the courtroom was the judge, the jury and

13

the defendant with her counsel, and there were the two TV

14

monitors in which the jury and the other spectators and

15

the defendant could see —

QUESTION:

But this was presented live to the —

in the courtroom?

18

MR. CURRAN:

Yes, Justice.

This was as it

19

happened.

It was live as the witness was cross-examined

20

or examined.

21

and the jury could hear and could at the same time see the

22

actual presentation.

MR. CURRAN:

None —
Dr. Sweeney was a licensed

be sent to jail for 15 years on the basis of testimony of

a child that she never even had the opportunity to be in

the room with when the child said that testimony, to look

at the child or if she wanted to personally conduct cross-

On the basis of one licensed social worker, she

MR. CURRAN:

With all due respect, Justice,

11

the — the facts will also demonstrate that there was in

12

addition to the child testifying as to what happened to

13

her, there was the testimony of Dr. Charles Shubin, a

14

child clinical pediatrician who documented physical

findings of scarring in the private areas of these

QUESTION:

MR. CURRAN:

QUESTION:

And the —
And the ability of counsel -- if the

defendant wanted to ask the questions herself to ask the

things.

s'

And the presence of the defendant.

I find it very difficult to think that that
isn't important.
MR. CURRAN:

Our position in that regard,

11

Justice Scalia, is that there was this finding based on

12

this testimony that the children were unavailable.

13

were functionally unavailable as we talked about in the

14

Roberts case, and if there is, in fact, testimony that's

15

unavailable — and, of course, in our case if the

16

testimony is unavailable, there is no evidence, there is

17

no truth-determining faction or function for the jury to

18

determine, and there's no trial.

19

That's our dilemma.

Absent these procedures where there can be a

20

careful analysis of the expert testimony and if

QUESTION:

General Curran, can I ask you a

question about the Maryland statute?

6

MR. CURRAN:

7

QUESTION:

I'm sorry.

Yes, sir.

If the, as Justice O'Connor pointed

8

out in her question, the test seems to be whether the

9

child could testify in the courtroom rather than in the

10

presence of the defendant, and if there were a finding

11

that the child could not testify in the courtroom and had

12

to testify in a — over TV, and if the defendant had

13

represented herself rather than having counsel, would the

14

proceeding have gone forward in the — by television with

15

the defendant confronting the child and doing the cross-

16

examination herself?

17

MR. CURRAN:

Our statute does not permit that,

18

Your Honor.

If the defendant chose to represent herself,

19

then we could not use Section 9102, and that's — that's

20

spelled out in the statute.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. CURRAN:

I see.
We — we can only use it when

23

there's counsel involved and only use it when there has

24

been a finding of functional unavailability.

25

The court verdict was in.

Several months later

1

there was a motion for new trial, at which time this whole

2

issue was argued again before Judge Kane.

3

again had the opportunity to reexamine all of the evidence

4

that had come forward — the competency hearing that he

5

conducted when he saw the children, all of the expert

6

testimony, the Dr. Shubin testimony, other witnesses who

7

confirmed statements made by the children — and held that

8

— in hindsight he reaffirmed his position that the use of

9

the statute in this circumstance was permitted and was

10

Judge Kane

appropriate.

11

Our court of special appeals affirmed that

12

decision.

13

reversed, and they reversed, Justices, on the basis of, as

14

they read your decision in Coy:

15

court did not reach that high threshold required by Coy."

16

And that's where we differ, and that's where we

Our court of appeals, our highest court,

"We find that the trial

part because we — we do not believe that this Court

18

established a high threshold requiring that before we

19

could use our section or any of the other states who have

20

joined us can use their respective sessions, they've got

21

to have the face-to-face confrontation between the

22

defendant and the victim or the televised face to face.

23

I suggest to you, Justices, that that would be

24

illogical to require the very trauma to be experienced

25

that we in Maryland are trying to eliminate, and this is

what the court, if upheld, would require us in Maryland to
do.

Try first to see if the young children who are deemed

by experts to be potentially seriously emotionally
distressed, try first to see if they can confront the
defendant.

If they are distressed and break down, then go

to the two-way television procedure.

If they are again

distressed and break down, then and finally then, you can
use the —
QUESTION:

Well, which is it — which is

it — which is it, just the trauma, or is it, as you
suggested a minute ago, the functional unavailability?
MR. CURRAN:

It is the plain meaning, Justice

White, of the term "serious emotional distress" such that
one cannot reasonably communicate.

I respectfully suggest

that is functional unavailability.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose there's plenty of

trauma but you could not conclude that there was
functional unavailability?
MR. CURRAN:

Well, then — then, as again — and

our statutes quite candidly permit the use of this for any
person 17 and under.
QUESTION:

Well, what's so unusual — what's so

bad about what the — your court of appeals did, it said
that if you want to — if you want to avoid having the
child testify in the courtroom, you ought to — you ought

to test it out — test them out ahead of time.

2

MR. CURRAN:

QUESTION:

Well, yeah.

It may be — it may be

4

that there'd be a lot of trauma, but it may be that they

5

could testify.

MR. CURRAN:

9

But, Your Honor, if — if we are

correct —

QUESTION:

And all you talked about is that what

you're trying to avoid would — would be — would happen

10

in the dry run, but you're — you're really after more

11

than just avoiding trauma.

in a big courtroom facing the defendant and the judge.

And I think you're correct that that is the thrust of our

out or which discuss this?

2

flawed.

3

and no one has studied the impact of good trauma, that is,

4

the trauma that comes from activating the child's

5

conscience when an innocent person is involved.

6

They all proceed from the assumption of guilt,

And so — and to answer the second part of your

7

question, I would think that whether or not it would be

8

advantageous to a cross-examiner would be the judgment of

9

the defense lawyer rather than the judgment of the court.

10

In this case Ms. Craig's lawyer adjudged that it

11

was not to his advantage.

He did not want this procedure,

12

and he objected to it fully and completely all the way

13

down the line.

14

And so what we have here is —

make an assumption that in all or most cases the truth­

given that there is no authority in support of the

3

said it was a bad experiment, what happens to Mrs. Craig?

And so, again, all of these discussions and

assumption of guilt and that guilt caused trauma.

The truth-seeking function of the courtroom would have

MR. MURPHY:

On the other hand, many cases will

2

not be prosecuted because the prospect of testifying face

3

to face falsely against an accused will be too much for a

And the truth-finding function of the courtroom

Although there are

times we dispense with it, we usually do that in the

fair.

13

But to deprive a defendant of one of the

fundamental tools — in many cases the most important tool
