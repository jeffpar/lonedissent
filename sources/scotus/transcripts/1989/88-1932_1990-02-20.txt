ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM C. BRYSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BRYSON:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether the Federal

11
12

Special Assessment Statute must be struck down on the

13

ground that it is contrary to the Origination Clause of

14

the United States Constitution.
There are two subsidiary questions here.

15

First,

16

whether questions regarding inconsistency of the federal

17

statute with the Origination Clause present nonjusticiable

18

political questions.

19

question is justiciable, whether in fact there was a

20

violation of the Origination Clause in this case.

21
22

QUESTION:

25

Did your office raise the

justiciability question in its petition for certiorari?

23
24

And second, assuming that the

1

I take it.
MR. BRYSON:

2

Well, Your Honor, we felt that the

3

issue on which there was a conflict among the lower courts

4

at the time we filed the petition and a conflict among the

5

circuits at the time we — this Court addressed the

6

petition, was the -- on the merits.
There was no conflict on the justiciability

7
8

question.

Now, we did advert in the petition to the issue

9

of justiciability suggesting that at minimum the question

10

of — on the merits should be addressed with an eye

11

towards the problems with justiciability and, therefore,

12

that the merits should be viewed with — by extending

13

great discretion to the — to the House in deciding

14

whether an Origination Clause violation had occurred.
But, no, we didn't directly raise -- raise the

15
16

point.

17

have merit.

18

to address the question, we — we have done so and we

19

believe that — that would be a perfectly legitimate

20

ground for a decision in this case.

21

We — we do think, however, that the point does
And since the Court has directed the parties

And — at — at bottom what — what this issue

22

presents, the whole political question doctrine is summed

23

up, I think, well in a quote from Coleman against Miller

24

which was reiterated in Baker against Carr.

25

it deals with the appropriateness of attributing finality

And that is

1

to the action of the political departments.

2

There are a lot of different kinds of political

3

questions, as the Court discussed in Baker against Carr.

4

There are political questions in which there is a textual

5

commitment of the issue to one branch.

6

which there are strong prudential reasons for the court's

7

not becoming involved in a particular question.

8

involving foreign affairs figure prominently in that list.

There are cases in

Issues

This case is a somewhat different case.

9

It

10

doesn't -- there is no direct textual commitment in the

11

Constitution of this issue to the legislature.

12

believe that when you look at all the factors bearing on

13

the question of justiciability of Origination Clause

14

questions, that you conclude that indeed it is not

15

appropriate for the Court to interfere with the judgment

16

that was made by the House and by the legislature as a

17

whole that there was not Origination Clause problem in

18

this case.

19

This is as Alexander Hamilton —

20

QUESTION:

21

But we

But, Mr. Bryson, does that mean in

some other case one would not defer?

22

MR. BRYSON:

No.

Our position is that with

23

respect to the Origination Clause challenges, that they

24

are subject to political question doctrine across the

25

board.

Now, one could say, and this is a backup

1
2

argument that we make, that certain kinds of Origination

3

Clause questions are simply not for this Court to second-

4

guess the House on.

5

obvious Original Clause violation should the Court

6

interfere.

7

And only if there is a very clear

That would be somewhat analogous to the position

8

the Court has taken in cases involving the question of

9

whether a particular person is a member of an Indian tribe

10

or recognizing an Indian tribe, an area that was discussed

11

in Baker against Carr.

12

Origination Clause questions as a whole are

13

nonjusticiable.

14

QUESTION:

But our initial position is that

I take it that -- that the House has

15

always got a remedy, hasn't it?

16

MR. BRYSON:

17

QUESTION:

Exactly.

And that -- that --

And we -- no -- no court would ever

18

be asked to review a -- to review the House's decision

19

that -- not to — not to pass a bill it -- it thought

20

should have originated there and didn't.

21

MR. BRYSON:

That's exactly right.

Or if in —

22

in any event, if any court where so asked, they would

23

quickly dismiss the complaint.

24

not come up for review unless the House is happy and the

25

Senate is happy —

And —

4

QUESTION:

And the President is too.

5

MR. BRYSON:

And the President is too, exactly.

6

The House -- I think Alexander Hamilton put this well when

7

he said in The Federalist that the Origination Clause

8

question is essentially the exclusive privilege of

9

originating money bills which belongs to the House of

10
11

Representatives.
If the House of Representatives is satisfied

12

that the Origination Clause privilege has not been

13

violated, then it can pass the bill that is sent to it by

14

the Senate and the President can sign it and that's the

15

end of the matter.

16

the matter with respect to questions of court review of

17

that statute.

19

That should be, we think, the end of

QUESTION:

Could you say the same thing, Mr.

Bryson, for the legislative veto?

20

MR. BRYSON:

21

QUESTION:

No.
Why not?

I mean, so long as the

22

President -- you could say so long as the thing only comes

willing to implement it that way to give away his powers.

2

We wouldn't let him do that, would we?

3

MR. BRYSON:

4

QUESTION:

5

No, we wouldn't — you wouldn't.
Well, why should we let the House do

it?

6

MR. BRYSON:

Because the House is not really, we

not an intra- inter-branch dispute over the creation of an

9

animal that the Constitution doesn't recognize.
QUESTION:

10

What's really — this is

It's an inter-House dispute which is

11

just as important as far as separation of the various

12

powers of the government is concerned.

13

significant?

What happened in the legislative veto cases was

18

that we had something that purported to be legislation

19

which simply wasn't because it was simply the views of the

20

House of Representatives, not concurred in by the Senate

21

and not presented and concurred to -- and concurred in by

22

the President.

23

In this case, all that's involved is a matter of

sequence in which a bill, which is clearly a bill,

arguably did not originate in the House —

Well, that — but that's just

demeaning the importance of the constitutional provision.

You may be quite right that it's not very important but

that's not for us to judge.

Honor, by allowing the House to decide whether there has

16

But we don't.

MR. BRYSON:

You don't and I think the

17

difference is because in the legislative veto case you --

18

you're talking about the presentation to the court of

something that simply is not a statute.

can fairly say this is not a statute.

QUESTION:

And if one of those requirements is

— is this sequence, then it's not a statute, just as
something that is passed without both Houses is not a
statute.
MR. BRYSON:

Well, I — I would disagree, Your

Honor, because -- to take the next clause that appears in
the Constitution after the Origination Clause, the
Presentment Clause requires when a bill is sent to the
President, that if the President decides not to approve
the bill, he sends it back to the House from which it
originated.
Now, suppose that he sends to the wrong House
and it originated in the House and he sends to the Senate.
The Senate then acts on the bill and overrides the veto
and sends it to House and the House then overrides the
veto.

It cannot be the case, I submit, that this Court

would then strike down the statute on the ground that it
was sent to the wrong House.
It becomes simply a matter of sequence.

Now,

one could argue that that is not a bill, not an act,
because the provisions set up in the Constitution were
violated.

But, of course, that can't be because a

President who wanted his veto sustained would obviously
always send it to the wrong House.

It's a question of —

Well, Mr. Bryson, are you — are you

12

relying on the — when you cite us to the second paragraph

of Section 7 of the express language that if a bill passes

both Houses and is signed by the President, even after a

veto, it shall become law?

MR. BRYSON:

QUESTION:

Which one couldn't argue in the

MR. BRYSON:

That's right.

That's correct.

That's correct.
To make the contrary argument, one would have to .

6

say you have to satisfy each and every clause and each and

7

every clause has to be fulfilled with respect — and that

anyone could come in and enforce — insist on —

9

compliance with that clause and that noncompliance results

10

in the invalidation of the statute.

both the -- the history of the Origination Clause and

looking at the second clause as well suggest that that

can't be the case.

And we submit that

Now, the — it's important, I think, in focusing

15

on the question of justiciability what the costs and

16

benefits are of striking down statutes when in fact both

17

the House and Senate, and indeed the President, have

18

agreed that the statute is valid and have passed it.

citizen is virtually negligible.

to be rather a minor matter are quite inconsistent with

the other prong of your argument in which you tell us the

House has been very jealous to guard this prerogative.

10

MR. BRYSON:

11

QUESTION:

Your Honor, —
I would assume that this is a very

12

important prerogative for the House.

13

assume that it might be that there is a majority of one

14

party in the Senate and very slim majority of the same

15

party in the House and that the minority members in the

16

House would have a very great interest in the preservation

17

of this — of this provision and not just supinely

18

surrendering it.

19

MR. BRYSON:

Exactly.

And I would also

They do -- it is an

20

important House prerogative. But I think when you — when

21

you say that what you are saying is this is something for

22

the House to exercise.

24

House and second-guessing the House.

1

the House to enforce that in part cuts against judicial

2

review after the House has decided that the prerogative is

3

not applicable in a particular case.

4

And -- and the example is, I think, what would

5

happen in a case like this, if in fact the Court started

6

actively to review Origination Clause questions, if the

7

House had even recognized this as an Origination Clause

8

question, and it seems to me in light of the fact that

9

this didn't look like what — what anyone has considered

10

revenue bills in the past, it would be perfectly

11

understandable why the court did not -- why the House did

12

not recognize this as -- as presenting an Origination

13

Clause question.

14

But suppose it had, it recognized it as a

15

potential problem for Origination Clause, instead of

16

simply deciding finally and for once that this was not in

17

the House's view an Origination Clause problem, they would

18

have had to go through the exercise of taking the statute

19

that had been presented to them by the Senate and putting

20

another House number on the top of it and sending it back

21

to the Senate simply to ensure that that statute would be

22

invulnerable to constitutional attack in the courts.

23

We submit that that really demeans the House's

24

role and doesn't enhance it.

1

jealously.

2

But it's also guarded it very well.
It's important, I think, to point out that in

3

two hundred years there's only been one statute which has

4

ever been struck down on Origination Clause grounds.

5

was struck down by a district court and the opinion in

6

that case, I think, is manifestly incorrect.

7

That

So that the sum total of -- of the contribution

8

of the judiciary in this area over — over two hundred

9

years in second-guessing the House, to the extent that

10

there has been any second guessing, has been one incorrect

11

decision.
QUESTION:

12

Mr. Bryson, in Buckley against Valeo

13

the court held that the provision in the Federal Election

14

Commission Act providing for appointments violated the

15

President's authority under the Appointments Clause.

16

the President signed that bill and we did not treat that

17

as a waiver or kind of an expression of general

18

satisfaction.

statement.

20

Now,

I think he might have made a signing

I don't remember.
So it seems to me that — that if -- if you're

21

going to rely here on the kind of the general satisfaction

22

of everybody involved with what went on, you have to say

23

that conflicts between the House and the Senate, or

24

possible conflicts, do not amount to the same thing as

25

inter-branch conflicts.

making today at the time when the House and the Senate

of their business through joint committees.

5

MR. BRYSON:

6

QUESTION:

Well, I -And -- and at that point I -- I will

7

say that the Justice Department seems to have taken the

8

position that after all this is — this is a family

affair, it's just an internal dispute within the

10

Legislative Branch and that's really not as important as

11

disputes between the separate branches.
MR. BRYSON:

12

Well, I think -- without trying to

13

give a global answer to all of these questions, I think it

14

MR. BRYSON:

The — on the merits, if I can turn

to the merits now.
The first question presented is whether the bill

4

in this case that's at issue was a bill for raising

5

revenue within the meaning of this Court's precedence.

6

submit that if you look at the Nebeker case — that's the

7

Twin City Bank against Nebeker — and the Millard case —

8

Millard against Roberts — it is absolutely clear that

9

this is not a bill for raising revenue within the meaning

10

We.

of the Court's precedence.

11

Those cases establish the proposition that if a

12

statute sets up a program and arranges a means to pay for

13

that program within the statute, that the means to pay for

14

the program do not constitute the bill -- a bill for

15

raising revenue within the meaning of the Origination

16

Clause even if the means for paying for the program turn

17

out to be taxes and even if the money that's assessed goes

18

into the general treasury.

19

This was certainly the case in the Nebeker case,

20

the Twin City Bank against Nebeker, where the Congress

21

imposed on national banking associations the costs of

22

setting up a national currency system in which — which

23

was, as the court explained it, to benefit all the people.

24
25

These were, as described by the court, taxes on
the national banking association.

They went into the

1

general treasury.

But they were, as the court explained,

2

for the purpose of paying for the program which the

3

Congress had set up.
This case follows a fortiori from that one

4
5

because in this case these were not denominated taxes and

6

the payments in this case go not into the general treasury

7

but into a special fund for victims.
Now, there are certain limited circumstances in

8

9

which these funds may go into the general treasury.

10

they are only in the rare case.

11

structure of the statute is that the funds that are

12

collected for the special assessments will go into a

13

special fund for victims.
QUESTION:

14

But

And the — the general

Well, it's your position then that if

15

the government decided we needed a new national network of

16

roads or needed to massively expend money to repair those

17

we have and enacted an income tax increase for that

18

purpose and put the money in the general revenue with the

19

idea that it wanted to support the road building, no

Senate.

I'm not sure you have to reiterate that kind of

MR. BRYSON:

Well, you don't because this case,

15

I think, is a good deal easier than that and I am just

16

trying to lay out what the limits of the Court's doctrine

17

had -- have been.

18

And I think in part what the Court is doing by

19

setting the limits very broadly for what is going to be

20

permitted in this area — what the Court is doing is

21

responding in part to the -- the difficulty -- the — the

22

-- the reluctance to interfere with the resolution by the

23

House and Senate of Origination Clause problems.

24

are, in a sense, deferring very broadly without actually

25

calling the question a political question.

benefit, no quid pro quo for the national banking

creation of a national currency system that was to benefit

There is a cap on the size of the fund.

Now,

It calls

upon the Court to evaluate the test for origination and

Right now, if the Senate passes a revenue bill

and sends it to the House and the House is now considering

It is the same language.

The staffers have talked and the

The House will not simply insert its own

They will set the

They will table the Senate bill and

10

they will pass the same bill with a House number on it and

send it back to the Senate.
If the language test is the test for

origination, it will stop that procedure from happening

14

because the Senate would have passed the language first.
MS. CLARKE:

A further

problem with the language test is the context in which the
