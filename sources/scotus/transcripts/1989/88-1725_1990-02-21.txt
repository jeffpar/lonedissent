ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD M. MOSK, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MOSK:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The issue in this civil rights case is whether

11
12

Respondent Mitchell, an attorney, can by enforcing a

13

contingent fee contract require Petitioner Juan Francisco

14

Venegas, who is the client and the prevailing party in the

15

civil right action, to pay over $800,000 in attorney's

16

fees when the court awarded, pursuant to Section 1988,

17

fees in the amount to the then-attorneys of $102,000,

18

which was almost twice the amount of the lodestar and

19

twice the amount requested and which included a

20

contingency enhancement factor.

21

In short, the issue is whether 1988 is to

22

operate as a fee-sharing statute or a fee-shifting

23

statute.

24
25

Now, prior to Mitchell the case had been pending
some eight years.

All of the discovery had been

completed.

2

summary judgment motions, appeals and pre-trials had been

completed.

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. — there's no issue in this

case about what the defendant would have to pay?

6
7

All of the law and motion materials, including

MR. MOSK:

There is no issue — that's correct,

Your Honor.

8

QUESTION:

9

that he has to pay?

10

MR. MOSK:

That's correct.

11

QUESTION:

All right.

12

MR. MOSK:

It was a projected short trial.

The — the lodestar amount is all

Thank you.

13

Indeed the — in Volume I of the transcript Mr. Mitchell

14

himself anticipated a four-day trial.

15

There was a high probability of a large

16

recovery, in that in the state court a jury had awarded a

17

million dollars, which was reversed on the basis of

18

sovereign immunity, which, of course, was a defense not

19

available in a civil rights action.

20

Mr. Mitchell had Mr. Venegas pay him a $10,000

21

non-refundable retainer.

That meant he kept it win, lose

22

or draw.

23

contract, which provided for 40 percent of the recovery

24

for one trial only, plus he would keep any civil rights

25

award which exceeded that amount.

And had him sign his standard contingent fee

QUESTION:

Do we know that that was his standard

form contract?
MR. MOSK:

Well, it was a printed form contract,

Your Honor.

5

QUESTION:

Including the one trial limitation?

6

MR. MOSK:

That would be the assumption, yes.

7

QUESTION:

That -- it -- it's a --

8

MR. MOSK:

There's no evidence to that effect

9
10

other than it appears to be a printed form contract.
QUESTION:

It -- it has been asserted that

11

that's unusual, that that particular feature is unusual in

12

contingent fee contracts.

13

MR. MOSK:

Well, it is our position that it is -

14

- it is unusual.

15

said that Mr. Venegas had the burden of showing that 40

16

percent contingency was unusual in a civil rights action,

17

never drew that distinction, that this was 40 percent for

18

one trial only.

19

And indeed, the court of appeals when it

And as a matter of fact, the way Petitioner

20

Venegas construed it, which was not unreasonable, was that

21

if he lost, Mr. Mitchell would not have to do the trial -

22

- do the appeal without extra consideration.

23

order to effect the recovery, he had to do the appeal and

24

undertake the recovery.

25

QUESTION:

But that in

Now, is -- is that the right way to

That would be the reasonable way of

interpreting it, not the way Mr. Mitchell interpreted it,

however.

QUESTION:

Mr. Mosk, does the Central District -

- that's where this case was tried, wasn't it?

10

MR. MOSK:

Yes, sir.

11

QUESTION:

Have any policy of regulating

12
13

contingent fees?
MR. MOSK:

Well, Your Honor, the answer is no,

14

not by rule.

15

indicated, and all courts have indicated that courts are

16

supposed to supervise — there is no specific regulation.

17

And indeed, the district court in this case simply said

18

that as a matter of law a — in a civil rights case a

19

contingent fee agreement is enforceable even if it exceeds

20

the amount of the court-awarded fee.

21

It is our — the Ninth Circuit has

And the only other thing that the district court

22

said was -- and I quote -- "Plaintiff does not claim that

23

he did not read the agreement before signing it."

24

that was the sum total of the district court's findings

25

and consideration of — of this fact.

And

QUESTION:

1

But you haven't made any independent

2

claim here that the contingent fee should have been

3

reviewed the way all contingent fees would be, regardless

4

of a civil rights case?
MR. MOSK:

5

No, Your Honor, other than to say

6

that all contingent fee agreements, and especially in

7

civil rights cases, when called to the attention of the

8

court, the court has a duty to exercise supervisory power

9

over them, as they have done in -- in every court

10

throughout the nation.
QUESTION:

11

12

Have we held that?

Have we confirmed

that authority in the district court?
MR. MOSK:

13

No, Your Honor, you have not.

14

Although, as I said, all of the cases seem to say -- and

15

including the one in the Ninth Circuit in this case -- has

16

said that contingent fee contracts are subject to the

17

supervision of the court.
QUESTION:

18

And -- and does that supervision go

19

to all aspects of the contract?

Just as an example, in the Ninth Circuit in this

case in Footnote 7 said that a —- when there's a civil

theory, but that was a rule which they laid down

6

themselves.

7

Why not?

Freedom of contract under respondent's

They also, in Hamner v. Rios, established

8

certain criteria and guidelines which we submit were not

9

followed at all because in this particular case the court

10

placed the burden upon Mr. Venegas to show that the

11

contract was unreasonable.

12

And secondly, it completely ignored the factors

13

related to the execution of the agreement and the great

14

disparity between the amount asked for and the amount that

15

was deemed to be reasonable.

16

And finally, didn't consider the -- how —

17

considered a contract reasonable which is manifestly

18

unenforceable both under state and Federal law by virtue

19

of the fact that the client — that the attorney had

20

withdrawn prior to the advent of the contingency.

21

QUESTION:

Did he have -- did Venegas have his

22

own counsel at that point, or was he — in these hearings

23

in the district court?

24
25

That is to say, a counsel other than Mitchell to
represent him on this contingency fee inquiry?

MR. MOSK:

1

At a — at a point in time after Mr.

2

Mitchell, who was counsel of record, filed his lien, at

3

some point at the hearing itself another counsel had to be

4

hired and was hired and did present written argument, yes.
QUESTION:

5

But apparently none of the parties

6

make any objection to the authority of the district court

7

to make this determination and whatever the determination

8

is with respect to the contingency fee contract that is

9

going to be binding on all the parties for state law

10

purposes.
MR. MOSK:

11

The answer is nobody objected to the

12

-- to the determination as such.

13

not is another question.

14

QUESTION:

Whether it's binding or

It's our —

Well, I thought the district -- I

15

thought the district court really only made —■ it made

16

some remarks about it that really left it to the state

17

law.

19
20
21
22

MR. MOSK:

No.

The district court blessed the

contract as reasonable, as did the Ninth Circuit.
QUESTION:

Now —

But said it was really a matter of -

- for state law to take care of, didn't he?
MR. MOSK:

Well, except for what we consider is

23

that the first bastion, the first guard, is the court

24

itself in which the attorney appears, in which all the

25

facts are demonstrated.

At that point, it is up to the

QUESTION:

2

You think the validity of every

3

contract -- contingent fee contract in a case that's tried

4

in Federal court — the validity of that contract is a

5

matter of Federal law?

6

MR. MOSK:

No, Your Honor.

7

QUESTION:

Well, what is it a matter of?

8

MR. MOSK:

It is a matter of the Federal court

10

But if a contract —■

determining at that stage, as they have in many, many
cases —

11

QUESTION:

With reference to what law?

12

MR. MOSK:

In reference to Federal law.

13

QUESTION:

So, it is a —

14

MR. MOSK:

Yes, it's a -

15

QUESTION:

— Federal law issue, the validity of

16
17

that contract?
MR. MOSK:

In a Federal — well, it's not the

18

question so much as the validity; it's the question of the

19

regulation of the attorney and the reasonableness of it.

20

It is true that if this — if this Court

21

determines, for example, that the — that the contract is

22

"reasonable," Mr. Venegas will still have the opportunity

23

in state court to litigate questions such as fraud.

24
25

But in state court the issue will not
necessarily arise.

It may in some context as to the

reasonableness.

It is for the court itself to determine

whether or not the contract before it is legal.

3

QUESTION:

Well, let's — let's assume that this

4

contract is completely valid and enforceable in state

5

court.

6

MR. MOSK:

Yeah.

7

QUESTION:

And if this case had been tried in

8

state court, the contingency fee contract would have been

9

enforceable and valid.

10
11
12

MR. MOSK:

No questions about it.

Except for the —■ the -- except for

the Fracasse v. Brent withdrawal aspect.
QUESTION:

Well, that may -- that may be so.

13

But let's just assume that it would be enforceable in

state court.

16

rights statute, to — not to enforce it?

Why should the — what basis does the

QUESTION:

It's a question of the court

Well, I know, but if it determines

1

that in these Section 1988 cases the courts have in effect

2

enforced the agreements.
For example, in several of the cases cited by

3
4

the respondent, the court has said — has required the

5

client to pay his attorney the difference between the

6

court award and the contingent fee.

7

the court's function is not — is to protect the attorney

8

and also to protect the client.

QUESTION:

Therefore, part of

Well, I can understand the court --

10

maybe a Federal court saying, well, we've got this matter

11

before us, we might as well deal with this contingent fee

12

contract, but then saying it's a — it's a matter of state

law and we'll just — we'll find out what the state law is

14

and then -- and apply state law to it.

15

16

MR. MOSK:

Not some

Well, all we're suggesting, Your

17

Honor, is that it's the first line of defense because an

18

attorney, as an officer of the court before whom he or she

19

appeared, is to determine whether or not that attorney,

20

for example, is -- is — is taking undue advantage of his

21

client.

For example, if the — if the contract had been

1

petition, that a Federal court in a civil rights case

2

should not uphold a contingent fee agreement which is

3

unenforceable under state law.

4

MR. MOSK:

Right.

5

QUESTION:

So I thought your argument was to the

6

effect that the Federal court had to look to state law for

7

enforceability.

8

9
10

Your responses to Justice White's questions
indicate quite the reverse this morning.
MR. MOSK:

Our position, Your Honor, is that,

11

number one, as a matter of Federal law, the court should

12

not enforce a contract — contingent fee contract where

13

the lawyer has withdrawn prior to the advent of the

14

contingency because that is a matter of general law.

15

Our next argument is that a Federal court should

16

not bless or deem a contract to be reasonable if it

17

violates state law, which it did here also.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

But the first of those arguments

isn't — isn't raised in your petition for certiorari.
MR. MOSK:

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

In the — in

21

the second item where we deal with the question of the

22

enforceability of the agreement basically under the

23

circumstances of this case.

24

every fact situation, but in our brief certainly we raised

25

that issue.

We did not highlight each and

QUESTION:

Well, I hope you will devote some of

2

your time — and, of course, your ability to do that

3

depends on questions from the bench as well as your own

4

schedule, I realize — to the question of —■ the first

5

question presented.

6

MR. MOSK:

7

The first question presented really goes to the

8

Court's ability to -- which it has done in each and every

9

case — to basically take what's a skeletal statute and

10

carry out its purposes and intent by a number of rules,

11

which has been referred to by Judge Posner in his book on

12

Federal courts as a type of Federal common law.

13

Yes.

Yes, Your Honor.

For instance, let me give one example.

There is

14

nothing in Section 1988 that provides a different

15

statutory guideline as between prevailing plaintiffs and

16

prevailing defendants.

17

a number of statutes which statutorily provide for such a

18

distinction between the standard for defendants and for

19

plaintiffs.

20

Not a word.

And indeed, there are

The — the — one of them is the Hart-Scott-

21

Rodino Antitrust Act, the Petroleum Marketing Act.

22

number of acts have that specific distinction.

23

Nevertheless, this Court in Hughes v. Roe in 1980

24

judicially enacted that -- different standards on the

25

grounds that it carries out the purposes and the intent of

A

1

the statute.
Now, respondent has simply said, well, what

2

3

about all these other fee limitation statutes?

Congress

4

knows how to say it or do it and, therefore, they didn't

5

do it in this case.

6

And the answer to that is that those fee

7

limitation statutes are basically dedicated toward

8

protecting a particular group of people, coal miners, for

9

example.

They also — the purpose is to protect the

10

Federal fisc because they are normally Federal statutes,

11

and in some instances to make the process less

12

adversarial.

13

Here we have a fee shifting contract which is

14

not a fee limitation at all.

15

what the attorney can obtain.

16

limitation is what the court deems to be reasonable.

17

There is no limitation on
Basically ,the only

Now, the — the other argument -- two other

18

arguments that defendant — respondent has made, and that

19

is, this just involves the relationship between the

20

plaintiff and the defendant and it doesn't involve his

21

attorney.

22

That's not true.

The statute deals with

23

attorney's fees.

It doesn't provide that the defendant

24

shall pay plaintiff monies which he can then use to pay

25

his attorney.

It deals with a reasonable attorney's fees.

1

It also — it's clear that Congress intended

2

that the recovery not be reduced by what the plaintiff

3

must pay his — his attorney.

4

Blanchard v. Bergeron.

And that's stated in

I might add that if we assume that Congress is

5
6

rational and that they act on the basis of — of case law

7

as it exists, back in 1948 and the Fair Labor Standards

case the Second Circuit, the Judges Hand and Jerome Frank

enunciated a proposition which was then picked up by the

Third Circuit.

And

I think they said it better than I can say

it said, it seems to us too clear for

argument

14

fee sufficient to compensate the plaintiff's attorney for

15

all his services and to permit him to collect an

16

additional fee from his client under a private agreement.

17

Such an agreement — such an arrangement would require the

18

cooperation of the court in the frustration of

19

congressional purposes.

20

that Congress did not intend the court to fix

a

Moreover, in this case the fee, by contract,

21

belongs to the attorney.

22

And

He said so.

finally, it seems to me that if the attorney

23

is to

be a co-venturer in this project, he should have

24

same risks, and the risk is what does the judge determine

25

as his reasonable fee.

He should also have the risk,

the

1

parenthetically, of having to undergo the obligation which

2

the plaintiff has of paying the defendant in the event

3

that the defendant is the prevailing party.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Mosk, is -- this argument you're

5

making assume —■ it seems to me it assumes that -- that a

6

reasonable attorney's fee is one single number and that

7

there couldn't be a whole bunch of reasonable attorney's

8

fees that vary enormously in amount.

9

So, one might say that the fee awarded by the

10

court here was a reasonable fee, and one might also say

11

that the -- that the 40 percent contract agreement

It's a highly regulated contract.

In

2

this very case, as I've pointed out in footnote 7, the

case itself in the Ninth Circuit says, a contract where he

bargains for both is unenforceable.
And as I said, since the days of Blackstone,

contracts which were deemed to be champertous or barratry,

the courts.

Yes, but if that's true — I mean,

me.

MR. MOSK:

Well, except for the fact that the -

- the contract is contrary to the legislative purpose.

19

basically violates that which Congress intended, which was

that the plaintiff remain whole.

And finally, in connection with what the court

4

did below, they placed the burden on Venegas, which is

wrong; they ignored the circumstances at the time, which

6

was an inadequate disclosure of the availability of

7

Section 1988; they ignored the disparity; and they deemed

8

reasonable a contract with is manifestly unenforceable

9

under state and Federal law.
So, for all these reasons we believe that,

10
11

number one, the Court should adopt the rule that Section

12

1988 precludes the attorney from receiving more than the

13

court-awarded fee, and if it doesn't emanate from Section

1988, it emanates from what this Court -- or at least the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. MILLER, ESQ.

15

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

16
17
18

MR. MILLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As the questions from the Court indicate, the

19

central question in this case is whether Congress, in

20

passing Section 1988, intended to restrict or limit in any

21

way the amount that an attorney could charge his client in

22

a civil rights case and specifically whether Congress

23

intended that the reasonable fee awarded to the prevailing

24

party is the limit on what an attorney can charge that

25

prevailing party pursuant to its own fee agreement.

1

The position that the petitioner argues in this

2

case would prevent an attorney from enforcing any type of

3

contract — a contingency fee contract, as in this case, a

4

fixed-fee contract and a contract based on an hourly rate

5

basis — any kind of contract that would yield a fee

6

higher than the amount set by the court under Section

7

1988.

8

9

Did Congress intend that result by this statute?
I think the answer to that has to be no.

Nothing on the

10

face of the statute indicates that Congress intended any

11

such intention or that it even addressed the question, for

12

Section 1988 does not address the question of what a

13

prevailing party may voluntarily pay to his lawyer in a

14

civil rights case.

15

Section 1988 deals with what a losing party must

16

pay by order of the court to the prevailing party as a

17

reasonable attorney's fee in a civil rights case, not —

18

it is not what may — what parties voluntarily contract

19

before a case is decided to pay for legal services.

20

Rather, it is how much a losing party involuntarily may be

21

taxed by the court as an additional recovery to the

22

prevailing party, in this case the plaintiff, to assist in

23

covering the attorney's fee or costs of the case to the

24

prevailing party.

understanding of the statute and the contemplation is that

Wow.

7

QUESTION:

Well, your position certainly

8

prevents the plaintiff from being fully compensated, which

has to be one of the goals of the Civil Rights Act.

10

MR. MILLER:

Well, Your Honor, I'd like to

11

answer that in two parts.

12

Civil Rights Act, as stated by this Court in the Blanchard

13

case, was to make -- Section 1988 — was to make sure that

competent counsel are available to handle civil rights

First of all, the goal of the

Pardon me?
To what end?
To the end that these clients —
To compensate a plaintiff who has

MR. MILLER:

Correct.

And to allow these

have cases that are not high-money cases, to obtain the

kind of counsel that plaintiffs in other situations are

2

able to get.

3

It was an effort to equate the civil rights

4

plaintiffs and to give then the wherewithal to pursue

5

their cases in court, even though those cases didn't —

6

normally didn't have large monetary prospects.
QUESTION:

7

Mr. Miller, supposing that we had the

8

kind of contingent fee contract that your client had here

9

and there had been an award of $20,000 damages and a

10

hundred -- and the court says, we'll give you $100,000

11

attorney's fees under Section 1988.
Now, how would that amount — you're getting a

12
13

total of $120,000 from the defendant.

14

divided between the attorney and the client under this

15

contract?

MR. MILLER:

QUESTION:

MR. MILLER:

40 percent of $120,000?
Yeah — 48 — four times — $48,000

in that case.

I —I believe under this contract

that the attorney would have been entitled to 40 percent.

How would that be

That's absolutely correct, Your

Honor.
Now, I — and I'm saying — I'm catching myself

4

here because I can imagine the next question.

5

have a contract, I suppose, in which an attorney provided

6

that I'll get 40 percent or the court-awarded fee,

7

whichever is greater.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. MILLER:

You could

Yeah.
I could imagine such a contract.

10

And then the answer to your question, under the contract

11

would be different.

12

QUESTION:

And if there was no arrangement for

13

attorney's fees at all and you have the same recover --

14

recovery, $20,000 damages, $100,000 attorney's fees, then

15

the attorney gets the $100,000?

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. MILLER:

Exactly.
Well, I — I don't think that's

18

clear at all, Your Honor.

19

the Blanchard case, together with the holding in the Jeff

20

D. case, indicates that the award of attorney's fees goes

21

to the client, it's his entitlement under the statute.

22

To me this Court's holding in

Now, it's normally anticipated that that award

23

is for the purpose of compensating an attorney.

24

for example, the attorney has a fee contract with his

25

client that would yield him less than the amount

But, if,

established by the court, I don't think it follows that

the attorney is entitled to that amount.

3

QUESTION:

Well, but then -- but then our whole

__ We — we have held under -- under this statute that

5

even though the — the attorney's agreement provides for

less than what the court determines to be a reasonable

fee, a reasonable fee will still be awarded — more than

what the contract says.

MR. MILLER:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

To —

And you're saying that — that what

11

happens to that excess over the contract amount does not

go to the lawyer?

13

MR. MILLER:

Absolutely if the contract doesn't

provide for it.

MR. MILLER:

No.

You've — you've held that the

2

court may award attorney's fees to the prevailing

3

plaintiff in the situation where there is no obligation by

4

the prevailing party to pay anything to his lawyer.

5

That's the Blum case, where the public interest firm

6

brought the case.

7

QUESTION:

But with no understanding whatever

8

between a private plaintiff and a private lawyer, an award

9

of $100,000 attorney's fees does not presumptively or

10

automatically go to the lawyer?

11

MR. MILLER:

Well, now -- I mean, you say

12

presumptively.

13

anticipate that the amount will be paid to a lawyer.

I think that most courts presume or

is a vexing issue.

1

But I think that the position that we've

2

advocated here is, and consistent with this Court's

3

holdings, is that the statute provides attorney's fees to

4

the plaintiff.

QUESTION:

Counsel, did the Petitioner argue in

the courts below that the contingent fee agreement was

unenforceable as a matter of state law?

14

MR. MILLER:

He did, Your Honor.

He presented a

That issue has since become moot, and it's

court of appeals on the merits of the case the plaintiff,

Mr. Venegas, entered into a settlement agreement and that

settlement agreement established an escrow account for the

amount of fee in dispute here and it sits in escrow

awaiting the final judgment as to who's entitled to the

attorney's fees.

9

So, it made the issue of lien moot, and all

parties have agreed to that.

11

need to remand those issues to the state court for

consideration.

13

QUESTION:

So those — there will be no

Did the settlement agreement also

3

Mr. Venegas did so.

He consulted Mr. Bromberg.

4

They concluded that they should not accept Mr. Mitchell's

5

proposal for handling the appeal and instead Mr. Bromberg

6

agreed to handle it himself.

7

represented Mr. Venegas and he represented Mr. Venegas in

8

And he, thereafter,

civil rights cases.

18

And that court sets forth a rather broad

the standards, indicated that he had a broad discretion to

And the Ninth Circuit sustained that.

2

So we don't see that there's anything left to be

decided on the issue of the enforceability of the contract

if this Court affirms the decision below.

Mr. Mitchell is entitled to the sum that his contract

provides him.

QUESTION:

If that occurs,

Kelleher thought about that issue and decided that it

I think that is more or less inherent in the power of a

1

one of the factors to be taken into account was whether

2

enforcement of the lawyer's contract would be consistent

3

with the policies of the Federal civil rights laws.

4

That strikes me as a kind of a Federal question

5

over and above the normal state law ethical questions.

Perhaps it's embodied in California state law, but I say

7

it's — that's why it's a tricky question.

8

10
11

14

To that extent, in a civil rights case the
determination by the district judge may be more than a
purely state law ethics question.
QUESTION:

Well, the state — the state would

have to take that into account as well.
MR. MILLER:

As I said, I think you would read

the state law as to embrace such a concept —

MR. MILLER:

To embrace -— in the appropriate case.

so, then I think you can say in all aspects he is applying

the same approach that would be applied by a superior

court judge in a state law proceeding.

of statutory attorney's fee, too?

Absolutely.

There's no question

about that.

And if

1

because the issue of the Fair Labor Standards Act cases

2

was raised for the first time in the reply brief, and I

3

hadn't had occasion to consider those before.

4

research on those because it didn't sound right, what I

5

saw in the brief.

We did some

6

And sure enough, what we found is — and I won't

7

belabor this -- that those cases themselves, and the later

8

cases that have discussed them, stand for the proposition

9

which we advance.

And that is that it's inappropriate in

10

a case -- in that instance, the Fair Labor Standards

11

situation -- for an attorney to recover both the statutory

12

fee and his contingent fee under his contract and that an

13

attorney should be satisfied with a single fee.

14

And I'll just cite to the Court the two cases

15

that the Court may wish to review on this issue.

16

v. Matson, 447 F.2nd 860, and Hayden v. Bowen, a Fifth

You could apply the statutory fee

20

against the contingent fee if it were — if the statutory

21

fee were smaller, I suppose?

22

MR. MILLER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And I

23

think what these cases stand for is that an attorney must

24

apply the statutory fee against his contractual

25

arrangement.

That is what Mr. Mitchell's contract

provides, by the way.
I think Mr. Mitchell felt that California ethics

law would require that.

4

that have dealt with this subject have said this, that

5

ought to be the rule.

6

we're not seeking both in this case, and don't advocate

that anyone is entitled to both.

The lawyer can't get

both.

But we are advocating that the lawyer is

his bargain and wins the case and secures the result

11

sought by the plaintiff when he entered into a -QUESTION:

is the kind of -- if I award this

the plaintiff in this kind of a case to get decent

counsel?

19

MR. MILLER:

I'm not — I — I'm not sure how to

answer the question, Your Honor, because I'm not sure I

21

followed the gist of it.

22

QUESTION:

Now, I suppose that this fee that the district

court awarded was that kind of a fee in his mind.

3

MR. MILLER:

4

QUESTION:

I think that's right.
And he nevertheless went ahead and

5

said the -- but nevertheless even though — even though a

6

fee of this kind would have been plenty enough — good

7

enough to get a — get counsel, this contract means that

8

the lawyer is entitled to something more.

9

MR. MILLER:

Correct, Your Honor.

And if a

10

civil rights lawyer felt confident and knew that in taking

11

one of these cases — not necessarily one that would have

12

this much damages, but any civil rights case -- that he -

13

- that if his client prevailed, he would receive a

14

statutory fee from the court, that he would — might be

15

satisfied.

16

But unfortunately that's not the situation

17

today.

18

D. most civil rights plaintiffs' lawyers in most cases are

19

at grave risk of receiving no fee whatsoever, despite

20

their efforts on the clients' behalf and successful

21

efforts.

22

Because of this Court's decision in Evans v. Jeff

And that's because the vast majority of civil

23

rights cases settle, as the vast majority of all cases do.

24

And cities and municipalities who are usually the

25

defendants, have caught on to the way — the fact that the

1

way you settle these cases is to get the plaintiff to

2

waive attorney's fees under the statute, particularly a

3

case that's been complex and long-standing and where the

4

fees promise to be fairly substantial.
So an attorney, in a civil rights context, is at

5
6

great risk now, as Mitch — and Mr. Mitchell has been the

7

victim of this on several occasions, as our brief shows,

8

doing a lot of work, achieving the essential results

9

sought by the plaintiff, or his client, and then having a

10

settlement made in which a condition of settlement is that

11

his fee is waived.
Of course, in that situation, particularly where

12

13

the defendant offers the client essentially the relief

14

sought, subject only to fee-waiver, an ethical lawyer like

15

Mr. Mitchell is in a tough bind.

16

not to accept the settlement just because he's not being

17

paid his fee.

18

that achieves the law — the client's basic objectives and

19

in the process talks himself out of his statutory based

20

fee.

21

He can't tell his lawyer

So he counsels acceptance of a settlement

Now, unless he's got some protection under a

22

lawyer's fee contract, he's going to be out in the cold,

23

and that's why civil rights plaintiffs' lawyers are going

24

to be discouraged from taking these cases unless the right

25

to contract, as in this case, is sustained.

QUESTION:

1

Well, should the Court in reviewing -

- suppose we think the statute doesn't set a cap but that

the district court does have an obligation to review the

reasonableness of the fee agreement, should the Court not

5

take into consideration the fact that this case didn't

6

settle, that a reasonable fee was paid, and that a 40

7

percent contingency above that on these circumstances

8

seems unwarranted because it reduces the recovery of the

9

plaintiff to such an extent?
Now, does anything prevent the district court

10
11

from considering those things and reducing the so-called

12

contingent fee?
MR. MILLER:

Venegas went out and

So, even after you deduct the 40 percent Mr.

Mitchell and his colleague are entitled under -- to under

their contract, the client here has been made more than

whole by any sort of generalized benchmark standard one

11

can look at.

QUESTION:

He got the benefit

Did the district court here even talk

17

about anything with regard to the reasonableness of the

18

fees, or did the district court just say, well, that was

19

the agreement the plaintiff signed?

20

MR. MILLER:

No.

The district court addressed

21

the issue presented to them as to whether the recovery to

22

the lawyers would constitute a windfall —■ he used that

23

term in his opinion — and he said it would not be.

24
25

Now, he didn't write a 12-page opinion on the
subject, but he saw the trial, he knew the background,

he's an experienced judge.

And he concluded that it was a

fair -- he knew about the state court judgment, I'm sure,

before.

Obviously he knew about that.

MR. MILLER:

11

12

Here we — he recovered $2 million.

Well, I think, Your Honor, what --

what this tells you is that in cases like this where the

13

special damages were very small and the entire —

14

virtually the entire judgment was general damages - is

15

that there is a wide range of what's appropriate recovery

16

in cases like this.

17

And how much a plaintiff is going to recover in

18

a case of this kind is highly dependent on the skill of

19

his lawyer.

20

He got the best.

21

hopes — no guarantee, but he hopes for when he goes for

22

the best.

23

In this case, Mr. Venegas went for the best.
He got the — he got the result that one

And now that he got the result he wanted and he

got the full benefit of that bargain, he wants to renege

25

on it as far as paying the fellow who did it for him.

QUESTION:

1

Well, of course, that's often true.

2

That in a bargain -- contingent fee cases there's not

3

exactly precise equality of bargaining power when the

4

contract is made.

There's no doubt about that.

Let me ask you another question.

5

You argued

6

earlier about the FLSA cases that say you can't have both

7

the statutory award and the contractual award.

8

your contract in effect gave you the -- the statutory

9

award — I mean, the contractual award plus 40 percent of

10

the statutory award.
So you did get —■ you didn't get just one.

QUESTION:

Yeah.

But I'm just suggesting there

22

is some tension between the contract in this case and that

23

principle that you could get one or the other.

MR. MILLER:

QUESTION:

Yes.

To a slight degree.

MR. MILLER:

The -- my time is about up, but I'd

2

just like to come back to the basic point that started

3

this dispute and which is the principal issue presented in

4

the cert, petition.

5

it could have, that there should be limitations on the

6

enforceability of fee contracts when they exceed the

7

amount awarded under the 1988 provision?

8
9

And that is did Congress provide, as

Congress has shown its ability to do that in a
variety of situations when it has wanted to do so.

But I

10

would like to leave with the sort of the fountainhead case

11

in this area that started all of this to begin with, the

12

Alyeska case, which is the case that led the Congress to

13

enact Section 1988.

14

And there, in rejecting the notion that the

15

court should on its own conclude to award plaintiff's

16

attorney's fees in successful civil rights cases, Justice

17

White's opinion for the Court said that that approach

18

would make -- I'm quoting now -- would make major inroads

19

on a policy matter that Congress has reserved for itself.

20

And in rejecting the rule in that case that had

21

been adopted by the court below, this Court said that the

22

law concerning attorney's fees,

23
