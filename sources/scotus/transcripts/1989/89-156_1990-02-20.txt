ORAL ARGUMENT OF WATER W. COHEN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. COHEN:

9
10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue before the Court in this case is

12

whether Congress in enacting the Bankruptcy Code of 1978

13

intended that a criminal convicted of welfare fraud and

14

sentenced to pay restitution as a condition of probation

15

in a state court can walk out of the state courthouse and

16

into the federal courthouse to have the judge's criminal

17

restitution order wiped out in a bankruptcy process.

18

The facts of the case are not in dispute.

The

19

defendants in September of 1986 entered guilty pleas.

20

They were sentenced to pay restitution in the amount of

21

$4,145 at the rate of $208 per defendant per month payable

22

to the county probation department.

23

A period of months passed.

They failed to pay

24

and they then proceeded in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing.

25

The probation department of the county filed a pre3

1

violation notice and subsequently held a hearing and then

2

the bankruptcy court instituted an adversary proceeding at

3

the instance of the Respondents and an order was entered

4

discharging the state court restitution sentence as a

5

debt.

6

That decision was reversed by the judge in the

7

Eastern District based upon this Court's reasoning in

8

Kelly v. Robinson.

9

decision reversed and the order of discharge stood, cert

But the Third Circuit in a two-to-one

10

was granted by this Court to address the question of

11

whether a restitution order is a debt that is

12

dischargeable in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding.

13

It is Petitioners' position that Congress did

14

not intend to void a lawful state court criminal sentence

15

in any way through the bankruptcy process or in particular

16

here through a Chapter 13 proceeding.

17

To have done so would have trampled on the

18

principles of federalism in comity that this Court in 1971

19

in Younger v. Harris discussed so thoroughly where the

20

Court recognized the fundamental policy in our system of

21

government against federal interference with state

22

criminal prosecutions.

23

Further, the language of the Bankruptcy Code

24

does not clearly spell out that criminal court orders of

25

this nature are to be voided through discharge in a

Chapter 13 proceeding.

2

Additionally, there was a string of pre-Code

3

cases going back as far as the case of In re Moore in

4

Kentucky Bankruptcy Court in 1901 where courts refused to

5

discharge criminal restitution sentences.
That is very important under the test that the

6
7

Supreme Court set forth in the Midlantic case and the

8

Court said that if Congress intends for legislation to

9

change the interpretation of a judicially-created concept,

10

it makes that intent specific.
QUESTION:

11

•

12

sanctions considered debts in pre-Code Chapter 13-type

13

proceedings?
MR. COHEN:

They were not, Justice O'Connor.

14

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. COHEN:

Were they dischargeable?
The criminal court orders were not

17

-- they were dischargeable, but under the definition of

18

debt.

19

the definition of debt, which was a much narrower

20

definition at that time, they did not fall under that

21

definition.

cited in our brief that stands for that proposition.
In the Ron Pair Enterprises case, this Court

2

3

also said that we must look very carefully to its clear

4

expression of congressional intent when there is a clear

5

conflict with state and federal laws of great importance.

6

Here the conflict is between the Bankruptcy Code

7

and the criminal laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

8

In Kelly v. Robinson, this Court said you must look to —

9

one must look to the whole law.

And if we do that, we

10

find no solid specific evidence of any congressional

11

intent to change that pre-Code law to allow for discharge

12

of criminal sentences.
QUESTION:

13

Well, what's the language that's

14

involved here?

What's the claim?

1

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose if someone qualifies

2

for bankruptcy, that's pretty good evidence that they

3

don't have the ability to pay.

4

MR. COHEN:

Yes, Your Honor, but a criminal

5

restitution sentence -- and this is specifically in

6

Pennsylvania, but I don't think that we're asking this

7

Court to just hold for Pennsylvania obviously -— but

8

specifically in the Pennsylvania statute, a restitution

9

order for welfare fraud can continue even beyond the term

10

of possible sentence for the underlying crime, which in

11

this case was seven years.

12

So that the probation order and the restitution

13

order can continue far beyond the three-year period of

14

consideration for the issue of what is available for the

15

creditors in the bankruptcy proceeding.

16

QUESTION:

Does the probation -- does the

17

welfare department have a right of setoff against future

18

payments for the nonpayment of the fine?

19

MR. COHEN:

The department would be able to

20

proceed to recoup if the individuals are still on welfare.

21

There is no process in Pennsylvania —

QUESTION:

Well, that's -- that's -- that's

exercising a right -- a right of payment, I take it.

It proceeds by going into court and

MR. COHEN:

That's correct, Your Honor.
I suppose that wouldn't make -- make

MR. COHEN:

QUESTION:

7

MR. COHEN:

If it were in a civil proceeding.
Yes.
If this Court had a civil judgment

8

order in front of it.

But what this Court has is a

9

criminal sentence from another court, a court that is

10

enforcing the criminal laws of the state, a court that is

11

making a judgment of what is the purpose of the sentencing

12

process.

13

And it is our position, which we advance of

14

course in the briefs, that the purpose of a restitution

15

sentence is the same as any other sentence.

purposes of rehabilitation of the defendant.

If you had a state where the welfare

department could recoup simply based on the criminal

judgment, would the debt be — would the transaction be a

debt in those states?

Your Honor, there are some states

24

that in fact have in the criminal statute a civil process

But it is still our position that Congress did not intend

2

to set up in the bankruptcy process, a method that people

convicted of crimes can escape from their sentence.

the department and I owe them some money and he lists it

as a debt.

Now isn't that dischargeable?
MR. COHEN:

3

Oh, because —

that process and

4

what the court did here was to actually end up with $120

5

paid out to the creditors and said that that was one of

6

the debts -- one of many debts that was dischargeable.

7

But we are not looking at a civil judgment or a civil

claim.

QUESTION:

9
10

We are looking a criminal court sentence.
But the restitution order — isn't it

measured by what the fellow took from somebody else?

11

MR. COHEN:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. COHEN:

It can be.
Wasn't it here?
And in this case it was.

But at the

14

same time a restitution order can be entered and has been

15

entered in Pennsylvania in 1987 in 5,000 cases measured

16

not by the total loss, but by some judgment as to what in

terms of rehabilitation of the defendant, what amount of

18

money would indicate to that defendant that he or she is

paying back money for something that he or she did

wrongly.

convicted for some fraud but he might just have

MR. COHEN:

1

Restitution for something that the

2

bankruptcy court has said that he doesn't owe but that the

3

criminal court judge can still say is a violation of the

4

laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the judgment

5

made by the state legislature.
And that's why in this discussion I think we are

6

7

pointing out the whole problem of did Congress of the

8

United States intend to limit the authority of a state

9

court judge or to wipe out the sentence of a state court

10

judge where the judge is enforcing the laws of the

11

Commonwealth, laws that the state legislature are suppose

12

to be able to enact to protect the citizens and laws, in

13

fact in this instance, that this Court in Bowen v. Roy

14

indicated were important laws -- the ability of the state

15

to police welfare fraud.

response directly to your question that the fine, penalty

In Kelly v. Robinson this Court -- Justice

Powell writing for the descent in TVA v. Hill, the

opinion — that if Congress had intended to discharge

state criminal sentences, we can be certain that there

10

would have been hearings, testimony, and debate concerning

11

consequences so likely to arouse public outrage.

12

In other congressional acts, such as the Victim

13

and Witness Protection Act of 1982, Congress very clearly

14

intended to highlight restitution as a criminal sanction.

15

In the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and

16

Enforcement Act of 1989, Congress showed its intent again

that restitution be a sanction in the savings and loan

scandals.

3

I'm sorry, I thought Justice Scalia was not

focused on the preferential transfer provision, but on the

5

underlying issue before the Court.

6

The whole question of the role of the federal

7

government vis-a-vis role of the state government, the

8

issues raised by this Court in Younger v. Harris lead to

9

an infringement on the sovereignty of the states if the

10

federal court can determine that a criminal court judge

11

cannot take into consideration all of the factors, all of

12

the sanction alternatives that are left available to the

13

court in a criminal sentence and decide what is the most

14

appropriate sentence to rehabilitate, to protect the

15

people and to punish the offender.

16

QUESTION:

As a matter of fact, Mr. Cohen, in

17

Pennsylvania is restitution often imposed as the only

criminal sanction or is it usually accompanied by a fine

MR. COHEN:

In this case, for example, Your

21

Honor, it was a condition of probation imposed along with

court costs so that court costs were separate from the

4

QUESTION:

Do you think if — if the Third

Circuit view prevails, the Pennsylvania criminal court

6

would have difficulty revoking probation for failure to

7

pay the restitution?

8

MR. COHEN:

9

It would have difficulty.

I think

that they could still do that, but the problem would be

10

they could only do that once there was a determination at

11

the time that the court was proceeding to the probation

12

hearing that the person had the ability to pay.

13

Now in the discussion -- in the oral argument --

14

QUESTION:

Well, why — why would ability to pay

15

be critical in deciding whether or not because the — it's

dischargeable in bankruptcy, you could nonetheless revoke

MR. COHEN:

18

Because you can't — under Bearden

v. Georgia, state court or federal court cannot revoke

20

probation without making that determination of the ability

of the defendant --

MR. SEARLES:

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Mr. Searles, if the Third Circuit

6

view is upheld here, do you think that a Pennsylvania

7

criminal court could revoke this particular Respondents'

8

probation for failure to make the restitution payment?
MR. SEARLES:

Your Honor, I think it depends

10

whether the restitution order is an independent component

11

of the criminal sentence or whether it's a condition of

12

probation.

And if the criminal court were to try to compel

16

payment of the restitution after discharge, I think that

17

would be inappropriate under Section 524, under the

18

statutory injunction against collecting discharged debts.

19

If there were still a condition of probation and

20

the restitution had been discharged, then I think the

21

answer would depend on state law, which is could the state

22

court judge modify or revoke probation when the original

23

conditions of probation have proved impossible or

infeasible.

It would be a bar insofar as in an

MR. SEARLES:

QUESTION:

9
10

Right?

That's correct.

Why -- why -- why did Congress not

apply that to Chapter 13?
MR. SEARLES:

Just an accident or what?

I think it has to do with the

11

purposes of Chapter 13, which is, instead of liquidating

12

your property and distributing the non-exempt assets to

13

your creditors, which is what you do in 7, a 13 is a means

14

to keep property and pay your creditors to the extent that

15

you are able to.

16

So it's a broader discharge in a Chapter 13

17

because the result in most cases is going to be that all

18

the debtor's disposable income is going to committed to

19

the plan and paid to the creditors.

20

that the creditors don't get 100 percent, well, Congress

11

A debtor who perhaps didn't have

-- couldn't meet the eligibility requirements of Chapter

than he can have under Chapter 13, might be forced to

Our main contention is that it -- restitution is

2

MR. SEARLES:

3

Besides the definition of claim in Section 101,

That's correct.

4

there are two other sections of the Code which treat

5

restitution as a debt.

6

debts that are fines, penalties, and forfeitures, which

7

represents Congress' codification of the pre-Code judicial

8

exception to dischargeability of criminal and civil

9

penalties.

10

One is 523(a)(7), which refers to

Congress has now upheld that those exception --

11

Congress has -- excuse me

-- written the law in a waythat

12

preserves those exception

to discharge in Chapter 7,

13

Chapter 12, some Chapter 11 and some Chapter 13 cases.

14

the fact that they acted expressly to protect those debts

15

in some cases but not others indicates that they did

16

consider them debts.

17

incorporated those exceptions in 13 for some kinds of

18

debts but not others, including fine, penalty and

19

forfeiture, that also indicates that it was a debt.

So

And, as I said, that they

which is another indication that Congress meant to include

2

criminal penalties as well.
By providing for distribution on fines,

3
4

penalties, and forfeitures, which wasn't the case under

5

the Act — because these kinds of claims were not

6

allowable, were not entitled to share in the distribution

7

of the estate — Congress has shown it's intention that

8

these are debts that should be paid.

9

And there's very good reason for including them

in distribution, because if they weren't included, the

11

entire estate could be liquidated and distributed without

crimes or serious torts who have not obtained restitution
orders.
If fines and penalties were not included in
distribution, this would set up a conflict between the
federal courts and the state courts over the
administration of the debtor's assets.

And by giving

bankruptcy court sole jurisdiction over the debtor's
estate in Section 1334(d) of Title 28 Congress has
expressed its intention that it's the federal — for the
bankruptcy court, a single forum, that administers the
debtor's affairs.
QUESTION:

Was there a great deal of conflict

during the 80 years of the previous regime, from 1898 to
1978?
MR. SEARLES:

I'm not aware of any cases

discusses that, but it appears to me that there could have
been conflict because the debtor's estate was being
distributed without the holder of the penalty or
forfeiture claim getting any money.
Finally, if you look outside the bankruptcy law,
at the Federal Crimes Code, there is a section in there
that shows that Congress obviously intended criminal fines
to be debts, which is Section 3613(f) of Title 18 which
was amended in 1984 to make federal criminal fines
nondischargeable in any bankruptcy.

ability to pay, whether they had violated probation.

The Davenports voluntarily appeared there and

the federal court, denied the motion to revoke probation,

decided that the Davenports had done what they were

Probation expired.

The state judge's power to rule is completely
unaffected by the bankruptcy and in most cases, if the

Third Circuit's ruling is — is affirmed, that is not

going -- the result is not going to affect the powers of

13

And the reason that there is no undue

interference in state court proceedings is that the

15

underlying goal of the 13 and the restitution is

16

substantially similar, which is that the debtor pay the
