ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD K. INGOLIA

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. INGOLIA:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Fifth Circuit held that in determining the

11

12

presence or absence of diversity jurisdiction in a case

13

involving a limited partnership it would consider only the

14

citizenship of the general partners as being relevant to

15

the determination of that question.

16

the general partners and that of the opposing parties was

17

diverse, the Fifth Circuit regards jurisdiction as having

18

been established.

If the citizenship of

limited partners who owned 99 percent of the partnership

2

and in effect held that they had no interest in the

3

outcome of the suit.

4

Now, the rationale adopted by this Court in

5

Navarro pointed out that it had never made an analogy

6

between a trust and a business organization for the

7

purposes of diversity jurisdiction.

8

Fifth Circuit is doing here.

which were the only assets of the partnership.

That

condition does not exist in the trust situation.
At least since the time of the decision in Great

Southern v. Jones, this Court has maintained that a

limited partnership's citizenship is determined by that of

5

all of the members of the partnership.

distinction made on a jurisdictional basis — on a

jurisdictional basis by distinguishing between the classes

of partnership.

QUESTION:

There is no

Did the Fifth Circuit opinion treat

the Great Southern case at all?
MR. INGOLIA:

No, sir, it did not.

It based its

12

decision entirely on their decision in the Mesa case, Mesa

13

v. Louisiana Interstate Pipeline.

14
15

QUESTION:

Did you cite the Great Southern in

your case -- in your brief to the Fifth Circuit?

16

MR. INGOLIA:

Yes, we did, Your Honor.

17

The Fifth Circuit is apparently of the opinion

18

that — imagine that this opinion arose from the Colonial

19

Realty Case decided in the Second Circuit, which was based

20

on Section 26 of the Uniform Limited Partnership Act.

21

that case, Judge Friendly, I believe, as the argument of

22

the court, held that he would not consider the citizenship

23

of the limited partners because Section 26 of the Uniform

24

Limited Partnership Act provided that they were not proper

25

parties to a suit unless their own interests were before

I think that conflicts with what this Court has

3

said in Navarro, particularly in its footnote 9 where it

4

compared the decision in United Steelworkers case to, I

5

believe it was Section 17(a) of Federal Rules.

6

pointed out that while, yes, it's true that perhaps a

7

labor union may file suit in its name and it is a real

8

party at interest, but that's a question separate and

9

apart from diversity jurisdiction, determined based solely

10

on the membership of the union.

11

12

the citizenship of all members of the union in arriving at

a decision on the question of diversity jurisdiction.

It not having been

One of the interesting things done in the United

15

Steelworkers case was this Court distinguished the earlier

16

18

considered to have jurisdiction of the -- of Puerto Rico

19

because it was created under Puerto Rico law — Puerto

20

Rican law, rather.

21

In Puerto Rico, as in any other civilian

22

jurisdiction, a partnership is a juridical person and has

23

been for centuries.

24

— or, this Court would not extend that principle to the

25

labor union case, because the labor union was not

something created under a system of law providing for

2

judicial — juridical personality being vested in the

3

labor union.

4

I suggest that the same reasoning should apply

here.

Therefore, it's a common law partnership and the Great

Southern case should cover that situation.

9

The partnership at issue is an Arizona partnership.

QUESTION:

It decided the

Is it clear that that business

10

organization under the Puerto Rican law was a — was a

11

legal person?

12

MR. INGOLIA:

Yes, Your Honor.

I assume that

13

the laws of Puerto Rico are similar to those of Louisiana

14

and their common civilian heritage provides that a

15

partnership is a juridical person, as a corporation is.

16

That provision is absent in Arizona law.

The

17

Arizona courts hold that a partnership is not a juridical

18

person; it's a collection of individuals.

19

that is the law that should have been followed because the

20

court was sitting in a diversity case and it should have

21

felt itself bound by the Erie decision and its progeny.

22

I suggest that

It did not do so, but it did feel that it would

23

maintain the position that it had taken in the two

24

previous cases it had decided.

that this decision would have been correct if the court
had been sitting in Louisiana?
MR. INGOLIA:

No, sir, I do not.

The court was

4

sitting in Louisiana, but it had to apply Arizona law in

5

determining the nature of the entity before it, an Arizona

6

limited partnership.

7

an Arizona partnership any more than an Arizona court

8

would apply Louisiana law.

QUESTION:

It cannot apply the Louisiana law to

So what you're saying is the case

10

would be different if you were dealing with a Louisiana

partnerships' legal entities?

Yes, sir.

There's nothing in the Uniform

It does not do that.

-- to that issue one way or the

other?
MR. INGOLIA:

I assume that the Uniform Limited

13

Partnership Act follows the class of common law and treats

14

partnerships as if they were collections of individuals,

15

as if they were contracts, as in fact they are.

16

QUESTION:

Do many states in the United States,

17

or any other than perhaps Louisiana, treat a limited

18

partnership as a juridical person?

19

MR. INGOLIA:

Not that I know of, Your Honor.

20

The only state that I'm aware of that treats a limited

21

partnership as a juridical person — rather, any

22

partnership, not just a limited partnership, is Louisiana.

23

From what I've read of the Puerto Rican law,

24

they follow the same principle which, of course, I imagine

25

reflects a common history.

contract and every common law jurisdiction with which I'm

3

familiar treats a partnership as if it were simply a

4

contract in which several individuals bind themselves to

5

do certain things.

6

But in any case, I think since we are dealing

7

with a diversity case, the court should have turned to

8

state law, pertinent state law to determine the attributes

9

of the party before it.

And if it had done that and

10

applied Arizona law, they would have seen that the

11

decisions in Arizona hold that partnerships are not

12

juridical persons if they are collections of individuals.

to a partnership that was organized and operating in the

If all of the partners —

Even though — even though the

16

MR. INGOLIA:

Yes, I think so, because we're

17

dealing with two different things, standing to sue and —

18

and how do you determine the citizenship of this entity

19

before the court.

20

and you can't confuse the two, and this Court

21

differentiated those two different things in its Navarro

2

you do that here.

3

juridical personality of a creature that we don't know

4

anything about.

5

We're a common law system; we're going to decide this case

6

in accordance with the common law.

7

And you're citing to us the --

That's something these civilians do.

I think that reasoning leads you to Arizona and

8

how Arizona treats limited partnership or any kind of

9

partnership.

10
11

When you do that, you find that Arizona

holds that they're not juridical persons.
QUESTION:

You say, then, a plaintiff suing a

12

limited partnership, even though the plaintiff asserts no

13

claim against the limited partners — even though he could

14

not recover against any of the limited partners still has

15

to name them all as defendants and they must all be

16

treated as separate defendants for diversity purposes?

17

MR. INGOLIA:

He may not have to name them all,

18

depending on the local law.

19

determining whether or not diversity of citizenship exists

20

must test that by the citizenship of all of the members.

QUESTION:

But a federal court in

But why does that make sense, really,

22

if there is no possibility of any judgment against the

QUESTION:

3

That may be a reflection on the

scheme of jurisprudence.

(Laughter.)

5

QUESTION:

In other words, you say that the

6

jurisprudence of the court does not differentiate on the

7

basis of whom you're seeking relief from?
MR. INGOLIA:

8

9

No.

The specific issue here was

the absence of Section 26 from the Arizona Limited

10

Partnership Act.

11

was no basis in Arizona law for making the distinction

12

between the limited partners and the general partners

based on the Limited Partnership Act of Arizona.

MR. INGOLIA:

16

I don't think it would have made

17

a difference because, as this Court held in Navarro, you

test diversity jurisdiction based on the citizenship of

19

all of the members of an unincorporated entity.

20

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.

21

MR. INGOLIA:

There is no basis in the law for

MR. INGOLIA:

against the partnership, you'd first exhaust the

think there's a difference between suing in a name and the

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
I will first, if I may, respond to a couple of
the questions that were raised in Mr. Ingolia's argument.
The first one was by Justice Rehnquist as to

6

whether or not the court of appeals, Fifth Circuit,

7

addressed the Great Southern issue.

8

particular case, but the initial case, Mesa operating

9

partnership, the Fifth Circuit did address the Great

And not in our

10

Southern case and basically dismissed it on two grounds.

11

One, that it dealt with an old 1900s, 18 — 19th century

12

limited partnership association that did not have separate

13

classes of members.

14

although deemed termed a limited partnership, is not the

15

same as the modern-day limited partnership that we have

16

today — only one class of member.

17

That limited partnership association,

Secondly, it was an old case and the Fifth

18

Circuit said that it would be applied only to those

19

particular entities.

20

So, yes, the Fifth Circuit has addressed the --

21

QUESTION:

Yes, but may I just ask you.

The

22

fact that it's been on the books since 1900, which way

23

does that cut?

for 89 years until this Mesa case came along.

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, it was settled for the

limited partnership association that the court had before

it.
QUESTION:

5

Well, does the opinion in the Great

6

Southern case say anything about the particular

7

characteristics of the limited partnership or does it say,

as I read it, corporations are an exception from the

general rule that everything else you look at the

MR. HOFFMAN:

But I

think that just looking at the case and what the holding

of the case was it can only be applied unless you all

intend to —

6

QUESTION:

Well, is it not true that people

7

generally -- lawyers generally for — ever since 1900 have

8

assumed that in a limited partnership you look at the

citizenship of the whole — of all partners?

MR. HOFFMAN:

entirely true, Your Honor.

MR. HOFFMAN:

At least three circuits have so held.

MR. HOFFMAN:

Judge Friendly in 1960 -- I think

17

it was '65 -- in the Colonial Realty case was the first

time the modern limited partnership was considered.

19

when it came through the New York courts, the Second

20

Circuit, you know, they looked at — the courts looked at

21

what they were dealing with.

22

I think — they felt that there was a distinction between

23

the entity with which they were dealing in 1965 and the

24

entity which this Court dealt with in 1900.

25

it was a valid distinction.

MR. HOFFMAN:

The two types of partnerships?

Right.
In the modern-day limited

14

Uniform Limited Partnership Act adopted by 49 states —

15

and Louisiana adopted some but not inconsistent provisions

16

— sets out a scheme of running the business.

that you have one class of partners that control the

18

business of the partnership.

The

And that is

You have another class of partner that is simply

20

an investor.

It does not — that class does not have any

control function.

under any state law to perform any acts for the

partnership.

It has no responsibility, no power

In Great Southern, as I recall,

QUESTION:

In what respect was it a limited

partnership then?
MR. HOFFMAN:

They just called it a limited

they had this president who could bring an action on

15

behalf of the partnership.

So basically it was limited in the sense that

the partners did not have unlimited liability, which is

exactly what is true of the limited partners in a

two-class limited partnership today.
MR. HOFFMAN:

5

Well, with one distinction.

The

liability side, apparently, was limited back in the Great

We have now, however, the Limited Partnership

limited liability status, but you cannot usurp the power

2

of the general partners simply by doing something you're

not supposed to.

4

And that's important for this reason.

When you

5

look at real party to the controversy, as that term has

6

been used in Navarro and a number of other cases that

7

we've cited in our brief, the power of the partners, the

8

power of the individuals to act for the partnership to

control the business, to sue on behalf of the partnership,

10

is vested only in the general partners.

what the limited does, he can't take that power.

upon the general partner are significant enough to come

21

MR. HOFFMAN:

That's a possibility, although I

22

think that the type of legislation that exists in the

MR. HOFFMAN:

Because it was by contract

That doesn't sound very

Well, it is and it isn't because

if you look at -- if you get into this analysis of

juridical person that Mr. Ingolia did, then it becomes

11

important whether it's statute or contract.

12

I think that for Great Southern the difference

13

between Great Southern and the modern-day limited

14

partnership is mostly involving the control and liability

15

and the access to the responsibility for the actions of

16

the partnership.

17

Yes, the president by contract was given certain

18

rights, but that did not foreclose the other what they

19

called limited partners since they were all limited

20

partners and they were all treated the same way — that

21

would not foreclose these people from becoming more active

and doing something and be authorized by the state statute

to do that.

1957 before Congress enacted the revision of 1332(c) -- 28

2

U.S.C. 1332(c) — that this Court — it was a

3

jurisprudential decision that excepted corporations from

the general rule as to complete diversity.

5

And this Court back in 1840 and then affirmed in

6

1850 with the Letson case and the Marshall v. Baltimore

7

and Ohio Railroad case made a judicial extension of the

8

diversity jurisdiction argument by permitting corporations

to be treated as -- as entities.

Now, I submit that you could do the same at this

juncture, although I'm not saying that that is the best

way to handle this case.

I do believe consistent with the opinion in

MR. HOFFMAN:

characteristics of the sociedad and compared them to a

but then, again, I think the stronger position for this

come up over the years is to look at the real

And then it becomes a factual analysis which

7

this Court was willing to do in Navarro and say, okay, the

8

trust beneficiaries hold this, this and this powers.

9

we're going to look at that, but we don't think that those

10

are the kind of powers you want to look to to decide

11

whether they are the real parties to the controversy.

And

12

Therefore, we're going to look at the trustees,

13

and we find all the requisite powers in the trustees that

14

are necessary to give this court the jurisdiction.

15

Because going way back to the Wormley case and the

16

McDutton case back in the 1820s this Court has

17

consistently held that we're going to look to the real

And the lease was by Arkoma?

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes.
But, yes, for all -- for other

10

than diversity jurisdiction purposes, Arkoma is certainly

11

a juridical person because that entity could and did in

12

fact own assets and contracted with various people,

13

including Petitioners for benefit and for — to conduct

14

its business.

15

So, other than the juridical person idea comes

16

up I think in a faulty context because nobody has ever

17

really asked this Court to assume or to hold that for

18

diversity jurisdiction purposes this limited partnerships

19

or all limited partnerships should be — should be

20

considered an entity.

21

If I may get back just one bit to the Navarro

Justice Blackmun, on the other hand, in the

dissent, indicated that he found it troublesome that the

Court didn't take the affirmative step and say, hey, this

is just like a limited partnership; this is just like

10

other business entities that are out in the commercial

11

world in the 1980s and say take the bull by the horns and

12

decide the issue.

13

Well, the issue wasn't exactly in front of the

14

Court at that time because you were dealing with a

15

business trust.

16

eight pages of analysis -- that you went through would --

would not have been necessary had it not been for an

opinion of this court or a feeling of this court that the

QUESTION:

4

MR. HOFFMAN:

No.

But keep in mind, the

distinction has to be made between the corporation — one

of the differences between a corporation and a limited

partnership is that you have this class of partner who are

or who is responsible for the debts of the partnership,

the general partners.
So they do -- you know, there's an intermediate

this Court can do so now with respect to limited

ground that it's more like a corporation than the one we

have today.

than the —

Great Southern.

MR. HOFFMAN:

10

Which one?

Well, I don't — I don't believe

I think Great Southern was less like a corporation

QUESTION:

Well, what's the difference between

it and a corporation?
MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, the corporation, of course,

16

has statutory board of directors authority and what not.

17

The Great Partner -- the Great Southern Limited

18

Partnership Association, as it was then called, I think

19

was just simply a contract between the people allocating

some responsibilities.

With the same kind of limited

liability the shareholders of a corporation have.

But all the limited —

Yes, right.

Yeah.

To that extent it is.

MR. HOFFMAN:

QUESTION:

MR. HOFFMAN:

5
6

Yes, sir.

So in that respect it's —
Okay.

There is a distinction in

that respect.
Now, the term, the operation of the modern-day

7

limited partnership, I think tracks very closely with the

8

operation of corporations, particularly when you get into

9

these master limited partners — partnerships that are

10

created and sold on the public market where you've got

11

thousands of shareholders where you don't really care who

12

the other limited partners are, you just purchase -- you

13

invest in this business operation and you've got

14

essentially a board of directors, i.e., the general

15

partners, controlling the whole -- the whole works.

16

And I think that whatever rule you decide today

17

has to be applicable to not only the partnership that we

18

have in question, which is a 44-member limited partnership

19

with only one Louisiana limited partner.

20

be applicable to these mass of master limited partnerships

21

that could cause, you know, a pretty big stink in the

22

securities industry.

23

And but it would

You know, I'm not suggesting that the people

24

invest in these master limited partnerships simply to use

25

diversity jurisdiction.

Not at all.

But it would be

unfair to preclude the master limited partnerships from

2

diversity jurisdiction because in all likelihood

never be able to get diversity if you're a member of one

of these master limited partners.

QUESTION:

No, but to the extent you rely on

securities problems, you get federal quest in

jurisdiction, I suppose.

MR. HOFFMAN:
the partnership itself.

Well, if it's a question within
But if it's a simple debt or

10

creditor relationship where the partnership is a debtor,

11

then the security problems really don't come into play.

12

And I might say that diversity of jurisdiction

13

is still here.

14

have it and we have to live with it and I dare say that in

15

my practice in south Louisiana and in southern Texas I

16

will always file in federal court with an out-of-state

17

plaintiff and I will always remove with an out-of-state

18

defendant in any of those state courts over there.

19

Some people don't like it, but we still

It may be awhile since any of you have tried

20

something down there, but I can tell you that there is a

21

reason for diversity jurisdiction still existing.

MR. HOFFMAN:

It's called home cooking.
Well, it's been called worse.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD K. INGOLIA

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

7

MR. INGOLIA:

8

The problem with the Fifth Circuit's decision is

9

Thank you, Your Honor.

you can't tell who is in control.

Someone who appears of

10

record as a limited partner may very well be the managing

11

controller of the business.

12

looking in with nothing but the record to look at doesn't

13

know that.

14

And someone from the outside

To -- if we're going to consistently apply the

15

Fifth Circuit's test, then we're going to have an enormous

16

amount of in limine litigation and discovery to determine

17

who among the limited partners, if any, have engaged in

18

the management of the partnership.

19

QUESTION:

If that --

I agree that control is pretty bad.

20

It's sort of hard to figure out who has how much.

21

what about a test that says, look, what we're confronted

22

with is an animal that is in between a partnership, a

23

regular partnership in which there's unlimited liability

24

on the part of all of the partners and a limited

25

partnership of the sort that was involved in Great

Here you have one right in the middle.

You have

some of the partners who have personal liability and

others who don't.

— you know, which way do you flop.

7

So the choice is whether you treat it

And why can't you say so long as you have some

8

partners who have unlimited personal liability you'll

9

treat it as a partnership involving those partners?
MR. INGOLIA:

10

Well, that's certainly an

11

argument, Justice Scalia.

12

operation in the administration of justice is a test,

13

following the current jurisprudence of the Court is a far

14

simpler matter than trying to delve into these questions

15

of who among the 44 limited partners may have involved

16

himself in management, if he did.

17

under Mr. Hoffman's test you can ignore that.
