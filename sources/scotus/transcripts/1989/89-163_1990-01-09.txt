ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM C. BRYSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BRYSON:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether a violation of

11
12

the time limits found in the pretrial detention statute

13

require the release of a defendant who is subject to

14

pretrial detention, no matter how strong the case for

15

detention may be.
The case comes to the Court from the United

16
17

States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.

18

facts, briefly stated, are as follows:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. BRYSON:

21

day, Your Honor.

But the

Is he still a fugitive?
He is still a fugitive as of this

We have not rearrested him.

The defendant was picked up at a border patrol

22

23

checkpoint some distance from the Mexican border in New

24

Mexico, and found to be carrying 72 pounds of cocaine in

25

his truck.

He chatted with the border patrol officers at

that time and agreed to participate in a continuation of

2

the investigation -- the so-called "controlled" delivery

3

in Chicago.
He was flown to Chicago to participate in the

4
5

controlled delivery.

The idea, of course, being to try to

6

capture the people who were buying the cocaine from him.
And the agents — one of the agents drove the

7
8

truck.

The controlled delivery failed.

The buyers did

9

not show up and Mr. Montalvo was immediately taken into

10

district court.

11

he was ordered to — transferred back to New Mexico.
In New Mexico a detention hearing was set and

12

13

held.

14

16th.

15
16
17

A complaint and warrant were filed, and

The day of that detention hearing was February

He had been initially arrested on February 8th,
and the transfer hearing had occurred on February 10th.
At the detention hearing, the magistrate, noting

18

that no pre-trial services report had been made and that

19

Mr. Montalvo's counsel had just been hired about three

20

hours before the hearing, granted a continuance, which —

21

the magistrate was apparently under a misapprehension had

22

been requested by the government, but in fact there's

23

nothing in the record that reflects it was requested by

24

the government, until February 21st, which was two working

25

days later.

This was over the President's Day holiday

weekend.
At that hearing the magistrate then took

2

3

evidence and decided that Mr. Montalvo was releasable.

4

The government immediately took an appeal, and

5

two days later the district court took evidence in a much

6

longer hearing and decided that Mr. Montalvo was in fact

7

not releasable under the pretrial detention standards of

8

the act because he was both a risk of flight and also he

9

presented a case of dangerousness to the community that

10

could not be disposed of by any conditions placed on his

11

liberty.
QUESTION:

12

Mr. Bryson, do you concede that the

13

government failed to comply with the statute here?

14

want us to consider the case in that posture?

15

MR. BRYSON:

We do.

You

We have brought the case to

16

this Court without contesting the question of whether

17

there was a violation.

18
19

QUESTION:

22

23
24
25

Certainly it might have been

contested, might it not —
MR. BRYSON:

20
21

As we've indicated --

It was contested in the district

court.
QUESTION:

— that there was waiver or one thing

and another.
MR. BRYSON:

There are a number of grounds on

which it could be contested, and in fact we did contest it

1

both in the district court and in the court of appeals,

2

but we lost.

3
4
5

And we think the more important question is,
assuming a violation, what follows from that?
Now, the district court, having found that Mr.

6

Montalvo was detainable both on risk of flight and on

7

dangerousness, nonetheless said that there was no legal

8

way that the court could detain him because the court

9

found there had been a violation of the time limits of the

10

act, principally because the waiver in Chicago of his

11

right to a detention hearing had not been adequate under

12

Johnson against Zerbst.

13

And that the magistrate, on February 16th, had

14

failed to — what the magistrate had done that was wrong

15

is that he had a granted a sua sponte continuance rather

16

than having a motion made by one of the parties for a

17

continuance.

18
19

QUESTION:

You were going to tell us of what

other possibilities than release are available.

20

MR. BRYSON:

Yes, Your Honor — Your Honor.

21

Just very briefly, the court of appeals affirmed

22

on what amount, for our purposes, to essentially the same

23

grounds as the district court, saying that simply the fact

24

that there was a time violation meant that he had to be

25

released on conditions.

Now, our position is that the — once there has

1
2

been a violation, that the language and purposes of the

3

pretrial detention statute do not require automatic

4

release.
In fact we look to both the language of the

5
6

statute and the purposes underlying the statute.

7

suggest that what the statute is really about is it

8

provides a limited period within which somebody can be

9

held prior to a detention hearing.

And we

It does not provide or

10

suggest and shouldn't be held to provide that a detention

11

hearing must be held within a specific period of time, and

12

if it is not held within that period of time that the

13

defendant may not, for any purpose thereafter, be

14

detained.

15

The language of the statute does not specify, as

16

the court of appeals noted, what the consequences of a

17

violation are.

18

shall be held immediately upon the person's first

19

appearance before the judicial officer, absent a

20

continuance for a period of three days or five days or

21

longer if there's good cause found.

The language is simply that a hearing

22

QUESTION:

23

relief or a remedy?

24
25

MR. BRYSON:

Well, is this a violation without

Well, I don't think so, Your Honor.

The relief is — is a form of relief that the defendant

4

Let me give an

5

13th, before the detention hearing, that in fact he had

6

already been held for as long as he could lawfully be

7

held.

8

release at that point or, in the alternative, a prompt

9

hearing immediately.

He could have moved in the district court for

And because the statute provides a period of

10

11

lawful, pretrial relief — pretrial detention prior to the

12

holding of a hearing, which is confined to a period of

13

three days or two days — excuse me — three days or five

14

days, depending on who moves for the continuance, he might

15

very well have been able to persuade the magistrate at

16

that point that the government no longer had a right to

17

detain him, absent a hearing.

18

to obtain either a hearing right then or release right

19

then.

20

So he would have been able

But once he's past that, once he has failed to

21

raise that point, and we are on into the detention period

22

and we're — well, a hearing has occurred, and he has been

23

found to be detainable, then you can't go back and say,

24

well, he shouldn't have been held for that period of time

25

between the expiration of the period that the statute

permits and the time that the detention hearing was

2

actually held.

3

for that two- or three-day period, he can't be detained

5

suggest that that kind of remedy is appropriate, looking

6

retrospectively for that kind of violation.

That the statute simply doesn't

QUESTION:

Is the only authority to hold the

authority that's set forth in the act?
MR. BRYSON:
QUESTION:

Well —
Does the court have some inherent

authority to hold -MR. BRYSON:

I think the court does have

13

inherent authority, but the act provides a limitation on

14

the period for normal court cases.

15

There may be extraordinary cases in which a

16

court can hold without proceeding under the act.

But

17

normally, what the act provides is this is a period of

18

lawful detention.

19

anything beyond this is necessarily unlawful because they

20

may be circumstances in which the inherent authority of

21

the court comes into play.

It doesn't necessarily mean that

22

In fact there's a case —

23

QUESTION:

Well, but before there was statute,

24

was the holding deemed to be by the sheriff or the United

25

States Marshal, or was the holding — is the holding by

2

the court?
MR. BRYSON:

No.

It would be under the

3

authority of an arrest warrant, so it would be the -- it

4

would be the marshal who would hold the person but the

5

authority would be granted by the arrest warrant under

6

which the person was arrested.

7

And there would have to be, for example, a

8

preliminary examination within a period of ten days if the

9

individual was in custody.

And at the expiration of that

10

period, a hearing would have to be held to determine

11

probable cause.

12

But — what I think the statute does, to answer

13

your question, is the statute provides for an area of

14

lawfulness to hold, pending a hearing, but doesn't

15

necessarily mean that, in extraordinary circumstances,

16

holding a person for some other purpose, may be unlawful.

17

This just gives us a safe ground for the —

18

QUESTION:

If the power — if. the inherent power

19

is there anyway, why would you need a statute to provide

20

for a period for when you're going to be held?

21
22

23
24
25

MR. BRYSON:

Well, I think the inherent power

really has to be limited to extraordinary cases.
The statute provides for the ordinary case in
which a motion is made.
The extraordinary cases, let me point out,

1

really, in the cases that come before the statute that are
discussed in the Senate report on this - on this act, make

3

the point that these are really are exceptional cases.
They are cases, for example, in which an

4
5

individual has made very clear threats against witnesses,

6

where the court simply has no other option but to hold the

7

individual under the inherent authority of the court.
I'm not suggesting that in the ordinary run-of-

8
9

the-mine case, the court can simply hold somebody in

10

disregard of the limitations in the statute.

11

the statute would provide the outer limit on the period

12

that you could be held without a detention hearing.

13

•

But again, that does not mean that the remedy
for holding longer than that period is that you

14

15

automatically say no detention hearing can be held and no

16

detention can be ordered.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Bryson, on this period when he

18

should have made the motion, was that -- what time is that

Well, there are lots of rights, as

effectively with counsel than without.
He did hire counsel.

He then retained counsel.

But that didn't occur

At that point, counsel sought to

protect his rights.

not seek to do so by opposing the continuance that the

QUESTION:

But --

It would also be true if he were

innocent, wouldn't it?
MR. BRYSON:

Yes.

This has the ironic effect,

of course, of saying that anyone who is not detained and,

6

indeed, anybody

7

vindicated in court, is the person without a remedy.

who's not detained and is subsequently

But of course, the remedy that is proposed here
by Mr. Montalvo doesn't help that person either.

Mr.

10

Montalvo's remedy only helps people like Mr. Montalvo, who

11

in fact are found to be subject to detention.

12

So his remedy isn't — in that respect, doesn't

help the non-detained person.

Could he be detained during the two-

That's

right.

Lawfully, he can be detained during the appeal.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. BRYSON:

I see.
This case, we think, to follow up

4

on Justice Rehnquist's question is, in a sense, like the

5

Mechanik case decided by this Court relating to errors

6

before the grand jury, where the -- any error in the

7

process leading to a finding of probable cause, is deemed

8

to be harmless when it's followed by a judgment of

9

conviction.

10

*

Here, by the same token, the error in temporary

11

detention is rendered, in a sense, harmless by the fact

12

that he is later found to be detainable.

13

Even if a remedy would be appropriate in some

14

instances, though, for cases in which somebody is held

15

during this temporary period and is later held to be

16

detained — even if there would be a remedy that would be

17

— if the remedy of barring the government from ever

18

obtaining detention would be appropriate in some

19

instances, it's not here.

20

First of all, there was no assertion by the

21

defendant of his rights at any point in this process.

22

didn't object to the continuances.

sought to waive objection in Chicago to the postponement

24

of the hearing there.

MR. BRYSON:

Well, the government would have

13

been in the position to make a motion to reduce below the

14

ten-year minimum for cooperation, and might well have

15

done.

16

But that never happened.
In any event, this was a case in which if there

17

ever is a case in which the remedy of precluding detention

18

is appropriate, this is not that case.

19

Now, I would point out that the argument that's

20

being made on the other side, as I understand it, is

essentially that the hearing time limits established, in

22

essence, a condition precedent for detention.

argument is an extremely sweeping one.

This Court, in Salerno, in upholding the

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. BRYSON:

Thank you, Mr. Panetta.

Only a couple of points, Your

Honor.
First, I think the closest analogy to the case

12

of a statute or rule that has mandatory language that does

13

not typically result in any sanctions or any remedy that

14

results in disabling the government from proceeding, is

15

the initial appearance rule which is closely related to

16

the pretrial detention rule, and that's Rule 5 which says

17

that someone shall be taken to a magistrate upon arrest

18

without unnecessary delay.

19

Assume that there isn't a statement which is

20

taken from the individual and subject to suppression

21

during the period of unnecessary delay — the mere fact of

22

delay has never been held or thought to result in the

23

dismissal of the proceedings against the defendant.

24
25

It — and yet I think it's interesting to note
that in fact, despite the absence of any remedy,

compliance with this statute, with this — excuse me, with

2

this rule, is quite good.

3

and they do follow their training to bring people before

4

magistrates without unnecessary delay.

I mean, the agents are trained

There are exceptional cases and, indeed, this

6

one may be one in which, shortly after arrest, there's an

7

agreement to cooperate, but — in which the appearance

8

does not occur immediately.

9

within a matter of hours.

But typically it occurs

The second point is that — it's important to

10
11

keep in mind, I think, when you look at the argument made

12

by Respondent with respect to the contention that the —

14

position of simply having to ask for conditions on

15

release.

16

1984.

17
18
IS

Because, after all, that was the system before

But there's been a very big and important change
in this statute from the pre-1984 system.
What Congress did in '84 was to make essentially

20

a bargain in favor of candor and fairness.

21

bargain was this:

22

provision in which pretrial detention could be ordered

23

directly, candidly; where this is what we're doing.

24

there was a provision that said, you cannot hold somebody

25

on unrealistically high bail.

And the

But

bail, it's got to be bail that that person can meet.
That's the reason that bail in this case, when

2

it way set, was set at $88,000 instead of half a million.
If it had been under the old system, it would

have been simple.

Well, is it a requirement now that if

That's 3142(c)(2), Your

Honor.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. BRYSON:

Well, that's a dramatic change.
It's a huge change.

And what it

13

means is, people like Mr. Montalvo, who somehow manage to

14

avoid the detention statute, even though they should be

15

detained, are given a free pass.

16

bail would have been set at a very high level, and he

17

would never have gotten out.

carrying a million dollars of cocaine, I submit that he

probably has access to $88,000.
