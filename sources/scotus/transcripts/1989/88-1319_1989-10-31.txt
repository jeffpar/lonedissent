ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. WALLACE :

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

11

In this case the tax court, in a reviewed decision,

12

and the court of appeals for the Seventh Circuit, rejected the

13

position of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue previously

14

upheld by the court of appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, that

MR. WALLACE:

Well, I concede that that is an accepted

2

accounting practice which the company is following, insofar as

3

I am aware that is the practice approved by the public service

4

commission.

5

But I certainly concede that that is an accepted accounting

6

practice that is followed by the company in its financial

7

accounting.

8
9

Whether or not it requires that, I am not aware .

QUESTION:

Then, it seems strange then that the

government would take the position that it does here on the

taxability of these deposits.

12

What if the deposits were

Would you be taking the same position?

MR. WALLACE:

No, we would not.

The position depends

13

on the fact that the monies come into the dominion and control

14

of the utility company, and are not segregated from the other

15

assets of the company , and are subject to its unfettered use.

16

QUESTION:

Why does it depend upon that, Mr. Wallace?

17

I thought you were arguing, in one part of your brief at

18

least, economic reality.

19

escrowed or not has very much different -- very much to do at

20

all with the economic reality of Lhe matter.

21

MR. WALLACE:

And I don't think whether it is

Well, under our tax system, and in

22

particular for an accrual basis taxpayer, it has to have a

23

right to the use of the monies within its own dominion and

24

control .

25

taxability.

QUESTION:

I suggest that in establishing that, they

2

are not looking to economic reality, which is what you argue

3

we ought to look to for the rest of the case , and not to

intent or to such -- such other matters.

5

MR. WALLACE :

Well, that is a form of economic reality,

Justice Scalia, in that that means that the company can use

the monies as its own, as it sees fit, to produce whatever

earnings it can produce - QUESTION:

MR. WALLACE :

That is correct.

QUESTION:

All that is at issue is whether when you get it it

14

Mr. Wallace, you mentioned this was a

Unanimous in the tax courts?

MR. WALLACE:

It was unanimous.

It was reviewed

4

because the previous decision of the tax court in the City Gas

case had been reversed unanimously by the court of appeals for

6

the Eleventh Circuit.

7

that have addressed this have been unanimous, and somebody had

QUESTION:

So, all three lower court decisions

Do you have any explanation why it has taken

10

so long to get this case here?

15 years ago, 1974.

12

MR. WALLACE:

One of the tax years here is

Well, these things do tend to get sorted

13

out many years after the taxable years at issue.

QUESTION:

exceeds the basic tax, and this certainly isn't justice,

normally.

22

MR. WALLACE:

Well, in any event the issue is now

23

before this Court for resolution.

And under the

24

Commissioner's legal view, there are only two factual

determinations in these stipulated facts recited by the tax

1

court that are critical here, and indeed are dispositive under

2

his legal view.

3

remaining details of the way this program was administered

4

become immaterial.

5

And in light of those two determinations, the

One is the one to which we have already adverted, that,

6

and this is set forth on page 23a of our Appendix to the

7

Petition in the tax court's opinion, that the deposits were

8

not segregated from the Petitioner's general funds, the

9

utility's general funds, and were subject to its unfettered

10

use and control.

11

forth on page 20a of the same Appendix, is that the intended

12

purpose of the deposits was t o ensure payment of future

13

utility bills by the customers required to make the deposits.

14

And the other critical determination, set

The Commissioner's position originated in a 1972

15

revenue ruling which we cite that considered the implications

16

for utility deposits of a series of three decisions rendered

17

by this Court and of related lower court decisions.

18

decisions, and this Court's previous decisions in the area,

19

are unchallenged by the Respondent here, and of course

20

unchallenged in the courts below.

21

Those

Those decisions established that advanced payments for

22

goods and services to be provided in the future, that an

23

advance payment is taxable income in the year of receipt.

24

the difficult question which was decided in this series of

25

cases is the one suggested by Justice O'Connor's question at
7

And

1

the outset, whether that should be true for accrual basis

2

taxpayers, whether to that extent the Commissioner had

3

authority to set aside the accrual basis taxpayers' accounting

4

method and insist on conformity in this respect for the

5

advance payments received on an annual accounting method.

6

that was the decision made in various factual situations in

7

the Auto Club of Michigan case, the American Automobile

8

Association case, and finally in Schlude against the

9

Commissioner.

10

And

And, as the court put it in the American Automobile

11

Association case, the deferral of the advance payment for

12

accounting purposes, and I am quoting now, doubtless presents

13

a rather accurate image of the total financial structure is

14

sound for financial accounting purposes, but fails to respect

15

the criteria of annual tax accounting, and may be rejected by

16

the Commissioner.

17

Section 446(b) of the current code and its predecessor,

18

Section 41 of the 1931 code, which gives the Commissioner

19

authority when he determines that the taxpayer's accounting

20

method does not accurately reflect income to require, in his

21

discretion, that the taxpayer use a method that does

22

accurately reflect income.

QUEST I ON:

And in those decisions the court relied on

And your position is that the deposits here

should be treated as advance payments, I take it?
MR. WALLACE:

That is precisely our position.

QUESTION:

But the problem I have with that, or maybe

2

it isn't a problem -- you tell me if I am wrong.

months, then the utility, over the period of 12 months,

MR. WALLACE:

QUESTION:

If you have

All right.

But under your view, under the

11

because you have to accrue each month.

QUESTION:

It would operate

Well, at the very end of the cycle -- at the

very end of the cycle it works out, although, of course, at

that point the utility now has a new customer and it starts

all over again.

9

MR. WALLACE:

Well, that might not be the very end of

10

the cycle.

11

security deposit may be applied to pay that bill at that time,

12

and the utility would get the credit for it.

13

took an advance payment that was designated for the December

14

bill, it would have to wait until the very end of the cycle.

15

I mean, that doesn't really differentiate the economic effect

16

of treating the security deposit the same as an advance

17

payment when it's intended for the same purpose.

18

to assure payment of the income that the utility is concerned

19

about in getting either the advance payment or the security

We agree completely with the court of

MR. WALLACE:

Well, there may be an inconsistency in

necessary symmetry between the way the Commissioner treats the

And I think that can be an unnecessary distraction .

If I may, for example, in an ordinary sales

MR. WALLACE:

That is correct, and -- but, what is

required in each case is to determine what the purpose of the

4

particular receipt is.

5

the purpose was to secure in advance, to ensure the payment

6

for goods and services to be delivered in the future, that is

7

a basis for determining, whether it is a utility or a

8

livestock producer; there is just a different context in which

9

to make a factual inquiry.

And here, when there is no doubt that

That is the basis for determining

10

that that is to be treated no differently from any other form

11

of advance payment for future goods or services, when that is

the reason that the money is received, and when the money is

subject to the dominion and the control of the utility upon

they looked at, and that the tax court looked at, seem

immaterial to us, and therefor will give rise, if each court

MR . STROBLE:

We have never seen why segregation of

these funds should be an important distinction .

21

has been that these funds -- these security deposits have many

22

of the same ear marks as a loan, as a borrowing of money,

23

because the security deposits are offset by an obligation to

24

refund upon conditions which essentially lie within the

control of the customer from whom they are collected .

MR. STROBLE:

Justice Kennedy, that is exactly correct,

but the situation in which it has to be returned is exactly
the opposite of what we have here.

In the case of an advance

4

payment, if the seller who has received the payments performs

5

his obligations under the contract, namely delivering the

6

goods, he gets to keep the payments he has received.

7

is on that basis that there is clear there has been an

8

increase in wealth that justifies taxation .

9

And it

In the case of a security deposit, if it is the

10

customer that performs the secured obligations, then the

11

amounts have to be returned to the customer.

12

QUESTION:

So it is --

But, the reality of the utility business is

13

that you can't pick and choose your customer.

MR. STROBLE:

Other than the interest

Well, another reason why it is not the

8

equivalent of an advance payment is that it is subject to a

refund.

11
12

QUESTION:

Well, so is the advance payment if the

customer elects to terminate the service.
MR. STROBLE :

Well, I think in a normal advance payment

13

situation the customer would want to make certain that it had

14

assured what it was going to receive for its advance payment.

15

There would typically be an agreement that in exchange for

as the equivalent of an advance payment, that the deposit

should be treated as if it has bought future goods and

What we are saying is that the payment in question

4

is not, the deposit is not the thing which triggers the

obligation to supply services to the customer.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Stroble, are you sure that that is true.

7

It is true that with respect to most of its customers the

8

utility has an obligation to provide services.

9

however, that when the state regulating commission approved

10

this requirement of an advance payment for certain people it

11

is saying you don't have to serve these people unless they

make the advance payment.

very rare cases, would supply service to any customer, would

Why do you think an advance payment is

MR. STROBLE:

In the three cases which Mr. Wallace

10

alluded to, the Automobile Club of Michigan, the Triple A case

and the Schlude case, the Commissioner fought very hard for

12

the proposition that there are circumstances under which the

accrual method of accounting can be deviated from.

income as the utility services are provided, as the customer

circumstances, it is appropriate to tax a party upon the

MR. STROBLE:

If he doesn't furnish -- if he doesn't

return the deposit.

But as long as he lives up to his

Nevertheless, meanwhile he has returned it

as ordinary income.

13

MR. STROBLE:

Yes, that -- that's correct.

Our

14

position is that the distinction there is that in the case of

15

a customer security deposit, if the customer performs as

16

agreed, then the deposit does have to be refunded.

17

words, if each side performs their mutual obligations, the

18

deposit is refunded to the customer.

each party's mutual obligations results in the seller being

entitled to retain the payment.

that case is the utility receives a prepayment for a given

QUESTION :

That's, I

Well, you don't accrue it when you, at the

is, if you do deliver the services, you return the money and

government's advantage.

But I am saying that always happens

to an accrual -- to an accrual taxpayer whenever you get an

advance payment.

4

is if it is an advance payment, yeah, that ought to happen.

5

But that still leaves you with the question of whether it is

6

an advance payment or not.

7

MR. STROBLE:

So it doesn't prove your case.

All it says

If it is an advance payment, then it

8

would normally be identifiable with some goods and service

9

that would permit the taxpayer to avoid that second, that

10

accrual, that separate accrual and the double counting that

11

would occur in the first year.

12

QUESTION:

If it is not an advance

Whereas a security deposit is carried on

13

indefinitely and might not relate to the first year, so the

14

government tends to maximize income to a greater extent under

15

security deposits than with advance payments.

16

MR. STROBLE:

Exactly.

The government is picking up,

17

in the one example, 13 months in a 12-month period, or in my

18

example, the government is accruing, basically double counting

19

the income for a given period of service.

20

QUESTION:

Of course, I guess the government could

argue it's the way we structure the hypothetical, it's the way

we are assuming the advance payment is designated.

directly contrary to the advance payment rules that -- and to

The best of the cash method

This other area that we see the Commissioner over

19

reaching in, essentially trying to take an advantage that is

20

not a fair advantage, is to criticize the facts and

21

circumstances test, which the tax court and the Seventh

22

Circuit utilized here, as being too vague.

23

addressing the treatment of the person who pays a deposit,

24

providing that a facts and circumstances analysis is the only

25

way to determine a proper tax treatment.

And then, when

MR. STROBLE :

I think it does in an environment where

method and tax the receipt of the cash as a prepayment, if it

really is a prepayment.

MR. STROBLE:

It is.

And the treatment of a cash basis

2

deposit payor, or deposit payee, has relevance.

The real

3

question is, in that Revenue Ruling, is this particular sum a

4

deposit or is it an advance payment?

5

that whether a particular expenditure is a deposit or a

6

payment depends on the facts and circumstances of each case,

7

which is exactly what the tax court and the Seventh Circuit

8

said here.

9

shown that the expenditure is not refundable, and is made

And the ruling states

And the ruling goes on to say that when it can be

10

pursuant to an enforceable sales contract, then in that case

11

it will not be considered a deposit.

12

points that we think are important in trying to evaluate the

13

taxability of the person that receives the deposit.

14
15

16

QUESTION:

So those are the very

But does the ruling say the converse?

That

if it is refundable it will be treated as
MR . STROBLE:

In , it enumerates four or five factors

17

that are to be looked at, and clearly the question of whether

18

it is refundable and whether or not it is part of an

19

enforceable sales contract for specific goods and services are

20

key factors in making that determination.

21

Commissioner would allow a consideration of the overall set of

22

circumstances to try to arrive at that decision, but clearly,

23

the refundability becomes a key point.

24

it shouldn't make any difference which side of the coin you

25

are looking at, as long as the issue is does the deposit serve

I think the

1

as a true security deposit or does it serve as a -- an advance

2

payment for goods and services.

3

The approach used by the Seventh -- by the tax court

4

and the Seventh Circuit are faithful to the general principle

5

recognized by this Court, that it is only amounts which really

6

produce some form of increase in wealth which should be

7

taxable, and that as long as the amount is offset by an

8

obligation to refund, that increase in wealth has not

9

occurred.

And it is only a review of the total relationship

10

between the parties that a fair evaluation can be made of

11

whether there has been a sufficient transfer of rights to

12

justify taxation.

13

The Commissioner's approach is essentially an arbitrary

14

per se rule that disregards the most critical facts to be

15

considered in making that determination.

16

the Commissioner's approach is to distort income, to

17

mischaracterize and misaccount for the actual earning of

18

income, which should be the purpose of good tax accounting.

19

For those reasons we believe that the Seventh Circuit and the

20

unanimous tax court properly evaluated the facts before it,

21

and concluded that these were true security deposits, and not

22

some form of disguised advanced payment.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WALLACE:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

This Court's trilogy of decisions were decided by

to four and five to four.

expressed in the dissenting opinions in those cases --

11

you had lost those three cases a fortiori you would lose here.

MR. WALLACE :

QUESTION:

It seems to me that if those, if

Yes, Mr. Justice.

Now, isn't it true that those cases

14

basically said that we will make an e xception from normal

15

accrual accounting procedures for payments received in

16

advance, as in those cases.

So what we have here is whether -

MR. WALLACE:

That is correct.

19

QUESTION:

we construe an exception broadly or

20
21

narrowly.
MR. WALLACE:

well, that is correct.

And those cases

22

are not challenged here, and Congress has tinkered with the

23

results in Sections 455 and 456 of the code, and has adopted

24

other rules where it saw fit to do so for prepaid subscription

Commissioner's Revenue Ruling.

But

And once what admittedly

Otherwise, you get into what the court of appeals here
admitted was functionally similar situations being treated

differently, such as getting an advance payment of the twelfth

11

month's rent, or getting a deposit equivalent to the twelfth

12

months rent that will be returned after twelve months of rent

has been paid.

14

two situations should result in different tax consequences.

15

Why -- there is no possible reason why those

And the tax court and the court of appeals, by

16

enumerating a number of factors to be looked into, has invited

17

an inquiry into whether a prepayment to secure the payment of

future income differs from an advance payment of that future

income, when there really is no meaningful difference between

the two inquiries.

Mr. Wallace, there is no significant

property, which you acknowledge is not taxable immediately.

Correct?

10

MR. WALLACE:

QUESTION:

That is never converted into income.

All right.

Well, but there is really no

economic difference between that and between the tenant buying
