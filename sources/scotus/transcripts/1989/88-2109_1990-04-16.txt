ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS J. GREENAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. GREENAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The principal question before the Court this

12

morning is whether or not the rule that has been set forth

13

in Hanover Shoe v. United Shoe Machinery, and in Illinois

14

Brick v. Illinois, that gives the claim for overcharges in

15

an antitrust case to the direct purchaser is entirely

16

without exception.

17

an antitrust case involving the sale of natural gas by

18

regulated utilities from the wellheads in Wyoming to

19

residential consumers in the states of Kansas and

20

Missouri.

21

In this instance we are talking about

We have a situation where formal cost-plus

22

pricing is the rule.

We have an extensive system of

23

Federal and state regulation that requires a 100 percent

24

pass-on of any increase or decrease in the cost of natural

25

gas from the wellhead to the burner tip.

We have in place

1

a contract in the form of a purchased-gas adjustment

2

mechanism, which provides that that pass-on shall be

3

complete and that it shall be immediate.
QUESTION:

4

Mr. Greenan, you say the 100 percent

5

pass-on is required from the wellhead to the burner.

6

You're saying, then, I take it, the utility corp —

7

utility commission in the state must require that a

8

utility pass on all of the cost?

9

MR. GREENAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

The purchased-

10

gas adjustment mechanism is set forth at Tab 3 of the

11

Addendum to the Joint Brief that was filed in the Tenth

12

Circuit, and it does — it is — does mandate that it

13

shall be passed on.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. GREENAN:

And is that a Federal rule?
That is a state rule.

It is also

16

contained in the purchased-gas adjustment mechanism

17

promulgated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,

18

yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

19

Well, if it were just a state rule, I

20

suppose some states might have it and some states might

21

not.

22

MR. GREENAN:

No.

In this instance the — the

23

interstate pipeline is regulated by the Federal Energy

24

Regulatory Commission.

25

mechanism requires a pass through.

Their purchased-gas adjustment

1

instance the states of Kansas and Missouri are — the

2

local utility distributors are regulated by their state

3

commissions, and there are purchased-gas adjustment

4

mechanisms on the state level that have that same

5

requirement.

6

QUESTION:

So what you are speaking then is —

7

from wellhead to burner, is true of residential consumers

8

in Kansas and Missouri?

9

MR. GREENAN:

I believe that it is established

10

in the brief of the amicus, the State of Illinois, Your

11

Honor, that those are present in 40 states.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. GREENAN:

14

QUESTION:

15

40 states —
40 states.

— by virtue of the rulings of public

utility commissions?

16

MR. GREENAN:

That is correct, Your Honor.

17

One particular item of interest in this case is

18

that the states are proceeding parens patriae pursuant to

19

15 U.S.0.15(c), and in that instance that they are

20

representing residential consumers who are natural persons

21

in their non-business capacity.

22

consumers, the record is clear, do not have the ability to

23

switch to alternative fuels, at least in the short term.

24

They have in place their heating plants, their natural gas

25

furnaces.

These residential

And in order for them to make a switch to an

to some other type of heating and to go through -QUESTION:

QUESTION:

So this isn't a fixed quantity

contract.
MR. GREENAN:

It is not a fixed quantity

contract.
QUESTION:

And the language, at least in

Illinois Brick, referred to a fixed quantity pass through.
MR. GREENAN:

That is correct.

Illinois Brick was to cost plus a fixed quantity.

find an additional exception in —
MR. GREENAN:

No, I think, Your Honor, it is the

same exception.

What — the way the Court described it in

Illinois Brick was that it was a situation where it would

be easy to demonstrate that the direct purchaser had not

And in that instance the regulation that we

QUESTION:

Do you think we could be assured that

6

the residential consumers would have the same incentive to

7

sue that the Court found was important in Illinois Brick

8

for the — in this case, direct purchasers, the utilities?

9

MR. GREENAN:

I think yes.

One of the concerns

10

of Illinois Brick was that there be vigorous enforcement

11

of the antitrust laws.

12

attorneys general asking permission to proceed parens

13

patriae on behalf of the residential consumers, so I don't

think that that is a concern.

QUESTION:

In this situation we have the

We have chief law

But there would be a general concern

17

by the Court if we are to articulate a general rule.

18

there any empirical indication that these indirect

19

purchasers —

MR. GREENAN:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. GREENAN:

Is

I think there is, Your Honor.

— would vigorously pursue?
Let's put them side by side with

23

the utility.

What we have to understand is that in the

24

regulated industry the utility is net really making a

25

profit on buying and selling natural gas.

It is not a

1

product that it receives, marks up and passes on.

2

it carries it through from the point of origin to the

3

consumer.

4

the senior vice president and general counsel for one of

5

the utilities says, we merely perform a transportation

6

service.

7

it requires for us to get it from the wellhead to the

8

burner tip, and then we charge them penny for penny,

9

dollar for dollar, whatever the cost is to us, and that is

10
11

Rather,

As the — testimony of Mr. David Black, who was

We take title to the gas for the few hours that

shown forth on their bill.
Now, if that is the situation, the utility then

12

does not earn a profit on the sale of natural gas.

13

utility makes its money by a guaranteed rate of return on

14

its invested capital.

15

return that investment, and so much by way of a return on

16

the investment.

17

QUESTION:

A

It is allowed to earn so much to

Yes, but that — but that return, as

18

I understand it, unless these rate-making bodies operate

19

quite differently from what I am familiar with, that rate

20

is established now for next year.

21

MR. GREENAN:

22

QUESTION:

That is correct.

Isn't that right?

So next year, if I

23

end up selling more gas than the state really expected me

24

to sell, I keep the difference.

25

MR. GREENAN:

Right?

That is correct.

QUESTION:

1

I mean, the effect of regulatory lag

2

is that if I sell more gas I get the — now, the state

3

will get back at me the next time we have a rate making,

4

right, and they will cut it back down.

5

on the basis of selling more gas than the state expected

me to sell.

And I lose money by selling less gas than the

In the short run, that is true,

Justice —■
QUESTION:

10
11

But I get a profit

Well, but life is in the short run.

We are just talking annual profits here.

12

MR. GREENAN:

That — that situation is

13

unaffected by the facts of this case.

The point that I

14

was making was in answer to Justice O'Connor's question as

15

to what was the incentive here.

16

just pointed it out well.

17

rates are established based upon what level of sales is

18

necessary in order to achieve that guaranteed rate of

19

return.

20

more gas than it had expected, it keeps that.

21

less gas than that it does not achieve its rate of return.

22

So what does it do?

23

commission and it files a new rate case, and it says that

24

our historic sales are now below what we had before.

25

need a higher percentage —

And Your Honor I think

QUESTION:

In the future.

But it has lost the

money for the past if — if its volume of sales has gone

down because its rates have been higher.

MR. GREENAN:

Exactly.

And that is what Judge

8

Posner, in the Panhandle Eastern case, said was a lost

10

nothing to do with the overcharge for the sales that were

Okay.

But we can't be sure that the

I don't believe that Illinois

Brick says that you can be sure that the intermediate

of supply and demand forces as to what affect prices.

3

But Illinois Brick itself said if it can be

4

easily demonstrated that the overcharge — that the direct

purchaser did not absorb the overcharge, then it might be

that there would be an allowance of a recovery by the

indirect purchaser.

But he does absorb some of the -- of

the overcharge, does he not, if he loses sales by reason

12

of the overcharge?

13

many people buy, and therefore he loses some of the profit

he would otherwise have made.

If he is selling a product that not as

MR. GREENAN:

He loses some of the profit.

He

does not pay any of the overcharge.

point, I think, the real point of distinction.

We are

18

looking at several things with Illinois Brick.

We want

19

vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws.

20

to see, if it is possible, that the people who were

21

injured are compensated.

22

there is no difficulty in demonstrating from wellhead to

paid by the people at the end of the line.

Going back to Bigelow and Storey Parchment, all

8

of the seminal cases on damages, the Court has recognized

9

that there can be claims for lost profits, that there can

10

be claims for decrease in — or increase in the amount of

11

operating costs, that there can be claims for loss of

12

investments, and all of these are separate and distinct

claims.

proof will not change one iota by giving the claim to the

residential consumer.

The utility will still have to make

So you say that you can concede

20

easily that the — both the utility and the consumer has

been hurt, but at least you know for sure, because the law

requires the pass-on, exactly how much the consumer has

been hurt.

would you be making the same argument if the law did not

No, Your Honor, I —

Because then you really would get

into a real bog, wouldn't you?

Yes.

up to the various regulatory bodies.

problem right there of separating out the two injuries.

all if you know precisely how much was passed on.

MR. GREENAN:

6

precisely how much is passed on.

7

We — and we do know, of course,

The — the question of what the regulatory

8

agencies are going to do when that is before them is one

9

that we can only speculate on.

10

The government chose to

speculate on it in its brief —

11

QUESTION:

But if they would — but if — even

12

assuming that they would do that, why then, then the

13

assumption is that you can identify easily how much was

There are forms, referred

passed on.

There are filings that are made by the local

2

utility districts of the various state regulators —

3

regulators that show the volumes to each class of customer

4

and the prices to each class of customer.

5

Now, one major problem that we have here in this

6

question of vigorous enforcement is that the utilities who

7

brought this litigation do not represent all of the

8

consumers who purchase natural gas that was involved in

9

this alleged illegal price fix.

We have a significant

10

number of consumers, some 50,000, maybe as much as 20

11

percent of the gas consumers in eastern Kansas, who

12

purchased from utilities other than the ones that chose to

13

bring these lawsuits.

14

QUESTION:

Well, we have no indication here that

15

the states would have brought the lawsuit on their own.

16

Didn't they come in after the fact —

17

MR. GREENAN:

18

QUESTION:

19

Three months later.

— after the utilities had filed the

suit, and kind of piggybacked on their suit?

20

MR. GREENAN:

I would say piggybacking is not

21

correct, Your Honor.

We filed three months after the

22

first case was filed.

23

of 1985.

The state case was filed in July of 1985, I

24

believe.

UtiliCorp, the utility that is here before the

25

Court, filed their case in 1985, dismissed it in 1986, for

The first case was filed in April

1

what reason only they can tell us —

2

QUESTION:

Voluntary dismissal?

3

MR. GREENAN:

Voluntary dismissal.

And then

4

asked and received permission to file again in October of

5

1987, very shortly before these motions for summary

6

judgment were brought.

7

Now, the defendants in the litigation claim that

8

their claims, the claims of UtiliCorp, are time barred.

9

And indeed it appears that they do have very significant

10

11

statute of limitations problems.
So relying upon the utilities here means, first

12

of all, that there are any number of consumers that are

13

not represented by the utilities.

14

the utility UtiliCorp that has this claim, rather than the

15

attorneys general as parens patriae, those claims may well

16

be time barred.

You have been running a sloppy

operation, not bringing suits for money that you're

MR. GREENAN:

But why, Your Honor, should I, the

utility, bring this suit when you are going to make me

disgorge, if that is the situation?

should I bring this suit if in fact it is going to go back

11

unresolved question, what happens to the two-thirds profit

MR. GREENAN:

QUESTION:

That is correct.

Mr. Greenan, what does the state do

Probably, if they have moved to

But the most likely thing —

9

(Laughter.)

10

MR. GREENAN:

Rather than some other state.

But

11

the most likely thing in this instance is that because

12

these people who do now still live within Kansas or

13

Missouri and purchase natural gas within those states are

14

known and can be identified, that the recovery, whatever

15

it may be, can be returned to them, either in the form of

16

dollars or in the form of reduced charges for natural gas

purchased down the line.
QUESTION:

18

Do we know, does the record disclose

19

what would happen to the recovery, if any, if the states

20

were allowed to proceed?

All the record shows, Your Honor,

is what the authority is under the parens patriae

MR. GREENAN:

How -

If we win this case, Your Honor,

11

that belongs to the utilities, because the commercial

purchasers are neither natural persons in the ordinary

sense, and they are businesses which doesn't allow parens

17

QUESTION:

But also -Could they bring suits on their own,

not relying on the state's parens patriae?
MR. GREENAN:

They could, Your Honor, they

18

could, but I think they would be faced with Judge Posner's

19

reading, Judge Posner's reasoning as to why he would only

20

allow it to the residential consumers.

21

because in the commercial and industrial area there is a

22

significant number of users that have the ability to

23

switch to alternative fuels, that have the capacity by

24

flicking a switch to go from oil to gas, let's say, or

25

from electricity to gas.

And that ability creates the interplay of supply

and demand which does not exist at the residential level,

QUESTION:

MR. GREENAN:

I don't either.
I see no reason to distinguish.

12

In that instance it is easy to demonstrate that the

13

utility did not absorb the overcharge.

QUESTION:

But even in the residential consumer,

as Justice O'Connor pointed out, there are some people who

turn the thermostat down and have to buy an extra sweater.

That's right.

And there is no way they can recover

the things that has followed this tremendous increase in

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

11

12

MR. FINCH:

Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it

please the Court:
I must disagree with Mr. Greenan about a number

13

of issues, first about what the issue of Federal antitrust

14

policy is before the Court today.

15

is whether this Court will continue to consolidate

16

antitrust damage claims in an injured direct purchaser, or

17

whether it will cloud the clear direct purchaser rule of

18

Illinois Brick by creating a regulated utility exception.

The issue as we see it

19

There is no need, we submit, in this case to

20

change the direct purchaser rule, which has been clear

21

since 1968 at least, because in this case we have over 85

22

percent of the antitrust damages being pursued by KPL,

23

which has over 75 percent of the damage claims, by

UtiliCorp, with about 5 percent, and by the other

QUESTION:

Well, it does seem to be pretty much

a windfall to the utilities, when 100 percent of it is

passed on to the customers.

5

MR. FINCH:

Well, Justice O'Connor, if I may,

6

it's not true that 100 percent is passed on to the

customers.

It simply isn't true, and that's one point —

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. FINCH:

Well, what if it were?
If it were, then, I submit that this

10

is the perfect case not to make an exception, because you

would have a utility regulatory commission that can force

actually paid them.

The district court did not find that, and there has never

There are, for example, line losses, in that

to do?
MR. FINCH:

Well, I submit it would not be easy.

The purchased-gas adjustment clauses are based on

But those are only estimates.

10

And there has to be an additional procedure that is gone

recover from the pipeline X million dollars, and you say

that party will have the greatest incentive to sue, so

that you will minimize the complexities that we have been

talking about here.

4

QUESTION:

Is there anything in the record to

5

give us an idea of the percentage of these — of the total

damages that were absorbed by the utility directly?

7

you talk about some of the gas being lost in the pipeline,

8

and the fact that you have to heat your own facilities.

9

am thinking de minimis, but is there some way you can give

10

me an estimate of what percentage of the damages were

11

absorbed by the utility itself?

12

MR. FINCH:

customers.

But you get into a problem of allocation.

20

Remember, we are talking about a preliminary question here

21

of, not quite standing, but antitrust injury.

22

And the way we got into this was at the very

23

beginning of the case we filed a motion for summary

24

judgment against not the states, but against the

25

defendants on the pass-on defense.

Because the defendants

were saying you don't have a right to recover anything in

2

this case.

3

And so, instead of having us litigate the issue

4

of allocation which you have raised, and try to determine

5

well, UtiliCorp has got 2 percent of the total

6

overcharges, whatever that number may be, the district

7

court quite properly concluded, under the doctrine of

Illinois Brick, that there should just be — an antitrust

damage claim should be concentrated in the direct

purchaser.

Yes, they would.

The question that Justice Scalia raised about

MR. ROBBINS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

With respect, I believe Mr. Greenan has

misformulated the question before the Court.

Illinois Brick is not that the direct purchaser is the

proper party to sue unless it is easy to demonstrate that

there has been no absorption of the overcharge.

in Illinois Brick is as follows, that with a cost-plus

fixed quantity, regardless of price.

3

case that the regulatory framework in which this case

4

comes before the Court solved the problem of

5

apportionment, that would only be the tip of the iceberg.

6

Illinois Brick is not simply about the apportionment of

7

overcharges.

8
9

Even if it were the

Instead, Illinois Brick and Hanover Shoe stem
from a longer tradition in which this Court has uniformly

10

held that an injured direct purchaser is entitled to sue

11

for the entire overcharge, regardless of whether and to

12

what extent that direct purchaser passes on the overcharge

13

to its customers.

14

and Illinois Brick dealt with when it adverted to the

15

possibility that there might be a cost-plus exception.

16

Now, one thing is perfectly clear.

It is that tradition that Hanover Shoe

And so, what is clear beyond, I think,

contradiction, is that if there is to be an exception to

an injured direct purchaser, injured in any form, injured

Now, it seems to me, Justice White, and this

8

9

before:

is this a windfall.

Well, in one sense I suppose

10

it is a windfall, but it was a windfall that this Court

11

recognized and anticipated the possibility of in Illinois

12

Brick, recognizing that it may well be the case that some

13

indirect purchasers who suffered an injury may not be

14

compensated.

15

anticipated because the Court concluded, as it had in

16

Hanover Shoe, that locating and maximizing the incentive

17

in the direct purchaser is the best policy for the

18

antitrust laws, seeking the maximum deterrence at the most

19

efficient price.

20

But that was anticipated for a reason,

QUESTION:

It is.

2

MR. ROBBINS:

But that was equally true, I might

suggest, in Associated General Contractors, where the

embrace of Section 4.

QUESTION:

But I guess the real question is

whether, in a case like this, the fundamental concerns

10

that motivated the Court in Illinois Brick would be met by

11

permitting the residential consumers to sue.

12

MR. ROBBINS:

QUESTION:

I think —

You can separate out the damages that

case.

17

It is possible to do that in this kind of

possible.

It is not, however, easy.

Justice, if the direct purchasers are in that lawsuit

alone they may attempt to seek both kinds of damages.

as a practical matter, because the overcharge will always

be greater than, or at worst equal to, the lost profits,

With regard to whether or not the 4(c) question

put his finger on it, that the — that the complaints were

QUESTION:

Only 4(c) permits —

suppose, is that if — is that the consumer under Illinois

Brick hasn't suffered any injury.

QUESTION:

Well, they can — they can attempt to

recover the damages that the indirect purchasers couldn't

recover themselves.

4

recover any damages, what good is parens patriae action?

But if the indirect purchasers can't

MR. GREENAN:

Well, Your Honor, I believe that

the clear intent of 4(c) is demonstrated by the

7

legislative history that is set forth, particularly in the

8

brief of the amicus, the National Council of — or

9

National League of State Legislatures, demonstrates that

10

Congress intended that 4(c) provided a separate cause of

action for the attorneys general to proceed on behalf of
