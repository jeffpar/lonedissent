CHIEF JUSTICE RENQUIST:

Larry Brewer.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER MICHAEL JUNG

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JUNG:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
In this case the Court is called on to revisit an

11
12

issue which it last addressed in 1961, the right of workers'

13

compensation insurers to avail themselves of diversity

14

jurisdiction.
The case involves questions of statutory

15
16

interpretation relating to the direct action proviso of 28

17

U.S.C. Section 1332(c) which deems an insurance company to

18

share the citizenship of its insured in a direct action

19

against the insurer of a policy or contract of liability

20

insurance.

21

The facts of the case are extraordinarily simple.

22

In April of 1986 Larry Brewer, who was a Texas citizen,

23

allegedly suffered a disabling on-the-job injury while working

24

for Whitmire Line Clearance, Incorporated, which is a Texas

25

corporation.

1

Brewer filed a claim for benefits with the Texas

2

Industrial Accident Board, and in May of 1987 that board made

3

an award in Brewer's factor.

4

Pursuant to Texas law, that award was not against

5

Whitmire but, rather, against Whitmire's compensation

6

insurance carrier, Northbrook National Insurance Company.

7

Northbrook is an Illinois corporation.

8

9

Northbrook chose to exercise its right under Texas
law to bring a suit to set aside the board award, and it

10

brought that suit in federal district court on the basis of

11

diversity of citizenship between itself and Brewer.

12

It did so with full awareness of two adverse Fifth

13

Circuit predecents which had applied the direct action proviso

14

to Texas workers' compensation suits where the employee and

15

the employee shared common citizenship.

16

Both the District Court and the Fifth Circuit panel

17

felt obliged to follow those precedents, but each court

18

questioned their soundness, particularly in light of a Sixth

19

Circuit precedent holding that workers' compensation suits by

20

insurers do not fall within the direct action proviso.

21

In my argument today I will first briefly address

22

the context and legislative history of the direct action

23

proviso and then turn to the two issues in this appeal, first,

24

whether this is, indeed, a direction action on a policy or

25

contract of liability insurance and, second, whether an action

1

by an insurer rather than against an insurer falls within the

2

direct action proviso.

3

As this Court is aware, in certain states -- notably

4

Louisiana and Wisconsin — an injured party is permitted to

5

bring a direct action against the tortfeasor — excuse me,

6

against the tortfeasor's liability insurance carrier without

7

joining the tortfeasor and without first obtaining a judgment

8

against the tortfeasor.

9

In 1954 this Court not only sustained the

10

constitutionality of such statutes, but also held in

11

Lumberman's Mutual Casualty Company versus Elbert that such

12

suits could be filed in federal court on the basis of

13

diversity of citizenship between the injured worker plaintiff

14

— injured emp — plaintiff --and the insurance company

15

defendant.

16

At about that same time attorneys for injured

17

parties in the state of Louisiana began to disfavor their own

18

state court system due to the unusual Louisiana appellate rule

19

which permits free and open reexamination of jury findings and

20

verdicts, and the results of these two phenomena was a massive

21

increase in the dockets of the federal courts in Louisiana.

22

23
24
25

The direct action proviso was the congressional
response to this situation.
By deeming the out-of-state insurer to share the
citizenship of his in-state insured, the statute effectively

Do --do -- do you get a jury trial in

MR. JUNG:
Honor.

I regret to say I do not know that, Your

I only know what —

7

QUESTION:

Well, that -- you're from Texas.

8

MR. JUNG:

That's correct, Your Honor, but the

9

legislative history suggests that you do because Congress was

10

concerned about plaintiffs choosing the federal courts so as

11

to avoid the reexamination problem that prevailed in Louisiana

12

state courts.

13

And Congress in enacting the direct action proviso

14

expressed concern, not only about the dockets in Louisiana,

15

but about the fact that direct actions filed by injured

16

parties in the federal courts did not fall within what

17

Congress perceived as the spirit and intent of diversity

18

jurisdiction.

19

Now, the congressional focus throughout the

20

legislative history is on suits by injured parties against

21

insurance companies and on the fact that such plaintiffs, if

22

they come from in state and file their suit in federal court,

23

have no need of the federal courts to avoid possible local

24

bias .

25

There is no indication in the legislative history

1

that Congress had any concern about the filing of suits by

2

insurance carriers.
Likewise, nothing indicates that Congress

3
4

specifically had workers' compensation actions in mind when it

5

enacted the direct action proviso.

6

7

It stated that there were, at the time, two states,
Louisiana and Wisconsin, which had direct action statutes.
Obviously if workers' compensation suits -- statutes

8

9
10

had been regarded as direct action statutes, that statement
could not have been made.
Only three years earlier this Court in the Horton

11
12

versus Liberty Mutual Insurance Company case had held that

13

notwithstanding the withdrawal of removal jurisdiction over

14

such suits, original diversity jurisdiction over workers'

15

compensation suits persisted, and yet nothing in the

16

legislative history of the direct action proviso suggests any

17

intent to tamper with or alter this Court's decision in Horton

18

or to otherwise affect workers' compensation suits.

19

The Congressional purpose in enacting the direct

20

action proviso is mirrored in the language which Congress

21

chose, particularly the term direct action.

22

The lower courts have had considerable experience in

23

distinguishing between direct actions that fall within the

24

proviso and other actions against insurance companies that do

25

not.

They correctly reasoned that direct action was used

1
2

by Congress as a term of art to refer to a suit against an

3

insurance company on a derivative liability, by which is meant

4

that the cause of action asserted against the insurance

5

company is one which could instead have been asserted against

6

the -- the insured.

7

QUESTION:

8

9
10

May I stop you there.

Why is it limited

to that?
You said it's a derivative liability.
It arises because the insurance company has issued a

11

policy to somebody who would otherwise be liable.

12

that apply equally in workmen's compensation or fire insurance

13

or automobile insurance?

14
15
16
17
18

MR. JUNG:

Why doesn't

Why limit it to negligence cases?

It is not necessarily limited to

negligence cases, Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

You — you would apply it to a fire

insurance policy?
MR. JUNG:

No, Your Honor, because that is not a

19

derivative liability.

20

between the injured person --

21

QUESTION:

I see.

22

MR. JUNG:

-- and the insurer.

QUESTION:

So, it's insurance that insures the

MR. JUNG:

Which is exactly what it is, Your Honor,

in most states, but not in Texas and some other states.
QUESTION:

5

Well, would you agree that in most states

6

if the — if the employee had the option between suing the

7

employer or the insurance company, it would be a direct

8

action?

9

MR. JUNG:

I would stop just short of agreeing with

10

that, Your Honor, and would say this.

Congress clearly in the

11

legislative history of the direct action proviso had in mind

12

tort statutes.

13

QUESTION:

Well, I understand that.

14

MR. JUNG:

It still takes the Court a little bit

15

afield from that.

16

employer is liable, analytically that is indistinguishable

17

from a direct action.

18

QUESTION:

But analytically in states where an

Well, then, why does it stop being a

19

direction action because it's the legislature of Texas rather

20

than the plaintiff who makes the decision that you shall

21

always sue the insurance company?

22

MR. JUNG:

Well, the legislature not only decided

23

that you shall sue the insurance company directly, it decided

24

that you have no cause of action against the insured employer.

25

QUESTION:

Is that true if -- if the insurance

1

policy had lapsed or if, in fact, there was no insurance or

2

sometimes the insurer -- is the employer scot-free then?

3

MR. JUNG:

He is scot-free of liability for workers'

4

compensation benefits.

5

common law theories, but there is not anywhere near a complete

6

congruence.

7
8

9

QUESTION:

He may well be liable on standard

But he has no liability under the Texas

workmens' compensation statute if he fails to insure?
MR. JUNG:

That is correct.

An employer in Texas

10

can never be liable for workers' compensation benefits with

11

the exception of some very specific self-insurance provisions

12

which require posting of bonds and so forth.

13
14
15

Apart from that, he may be liable at common law for
his own negligence, just as any negligent party.
QUESTION:

But supposing he's not negligent?

16

Because workmens' compensation applies even in the absence of

17

negligence.

18

Then it would be wise.

Of course, he -- he -- I suppose the employer would

19

risk criminal responsibilities or something like that.

20

just falsely represent that they have insurance coverage —

21

MR. JUNG:

But to

Well, for falsely representing, he would

22

risk criminal liability, but in fact, workers' compensation

23

insurance is voluntary in Texas, and an employer who wishes to

24

run the gauntlet of having common law liability is not

25

obligated to purchase workers' compensation insurance.

1

QUESTION:

I see.

2

MR. JUNG:

And that's a fairly unusual feature of

3

the Texas scheme.
It's a feature that we believe is dispositive of

4
5

this case in that in Texas workers' compensation liability on

6

the insurance carrier is a primary liability, not a derivative

7

liability, and the cause of action asserted against the

8

insurer for workers' compensation benefits is not a cause of

9

action which could be asserted against the employer.
QUESTION:

And for that reason it's not a direct

12

MR. JUNG:

For that reason it is not a direct

13

action, Your Honor.

14

QUESTION:

What kind of an action is it?.

15

MR. JUNG:

It's an action.

10
11

16

action?

There's no guestion

about that.

17

QUESTION:

It's not an indirect action, is it?

18

MR. JUNG:

It is not an indirect action, and yet the

19

courts have said that any action which is filed against an

20

insurance carrier does not merely because it is filed directly

21

against that insurance carrier qualify for the term of art

22

direct action.

23

If that had a more specific meaning than that as is

24

reflected in the legislative history and the context of the

25

statute.

QUESTION:

1
2

is.

3

else.

You don't know what kind of an action it

It is not indirect, and it's not direct.

MR. JUNG:

4

It's something

That's correct, and there are many cases

5

in the lower courts where there are suits on two-party

6

insurance, say, against a fire insurer for failing to pay a

7

claim, and the courts have said that is not a direct action.

8

It is something else, and they haven't given another label to

9

it.
The statute applies by its terms not to direct

10
11

actions generally, but to direct actions against insurance

12

companies, and the Fifth and Sixth Circuits have split on the

13

interpretation of that provision and the application of it to

14

workers' compensation suits filed by insurers rather than

15

against insurers.

16

The Fifth Circuit has reasoned that the entire

17

workers' compensation process must be treated as a claim by an

18

insured worker against an insurance carrier to recovery money,

19

and has held in Campbell versus Insurance Company of North

20

America that a workers' compensation suit by an insurance

21

company is, in fact, the same thing as a workers' compensation

22

suit against an insurance company.

23

reasoned that it would be unfair to deny a federal forum to an

24

injured worker, but to afford that forum to an insurance

25

company.

And the Court also

1

The Sixth Circuit, on the other hand, in Aetna Life

2

and Casualty Company versus Greene reasoned first, that there

3

is nothing in the direct — in the legislative history of the

4

direct action proviso to suggest its application to suits by

5

insurers; second, that indeed, such suits do fall, unlike

6

suits by injured workers, within the spirit and purpose of

7

diversity jurisdiction; and, finally, that it would do

8

unwarranted violence to the language used by Congress to say

9

that a suit brought by an insurance company is, in fact,

10

against the insurance company.
And Congress had good reason to choose the phrase

11

12

"against the insurance company" when drafting the direct

13

action proviso.

14

generally speaking, he is -- files suit in the state in which

15

he lives.

16

Where an injured worker files a suit,

And if he chooses a federal court in preference to his

17

own home state court, he does so for gratuitous reasons of

18

litigation strategy unrelated to the purposes that the framers

19

in the original Congress had in mind in enacting diversity

20

jurisdiction.

21

Direct actions brought by out-of-state insurers, on

22

the other hand, partake of all the classical incidents of

23

diversity jurisdiction.

24

actual or perceived local bias in the state courts.

25

Fifth Circuit's focus in Campbell on the big picture was, we

They represent an attempt to avoid

Thus, the

submit, a blurred focus.

2

the administrative claim or on who's seeking money from whom

3

or on who bears the burden of proof, but it should be on who

4

made the decision to bring this dispute in a federal court and

5

on whether the likely reasons underlying that decision are in

6

accord or in discord with the purposes of diversity

7

jurisdiction.

8

QUESTION:

The focus should not be on who filed

May I ask, Mr. Jung, in the area of

9

negligence insurance coverage and the like, are there cases

10

resolving this by or against question whether an insurance

11

company might have brought suit against the prospective

12

plaintiff and the insured to determine whether there was

13

coverage or something like that?

14

MR. JUNG:

There are indeed, Your Honor, and

15

ironically they're in the Fifth Circuit.

16

cases, Dairyland Insurance Company versus Makover and Evanston

17

Insurance Company versus Jimco, the Fifth Circuit has limited

18

Campbell to its facts and to the context of workers'

19

compensation insurance.

20

And in both of the

And in those cases an insurer did what Your Honor

21

described, brought a reverse direct action in Louisiana

22

against the injured party/would-be plaintiff and against its

23

own would-be insured to determine the coverage question, and

24

the courts entertained the suit reasoning that that is not a

25

direct action.

1

Indeed, in the Evanston case, the Court went so far

2

as to say, "The direct action proviso has no applicability to

3

suits by insurers."

4

QUESTION:

5

Did they say it was not a direct action

or it wasn't by the insurance company?
MR. JUNG:

They went off on by the insurance company

8

QUESTION:

Yeah, I understand.

9

MR. JUNG:

— and they distinguished — they limited

6

7

10

Campbell to its facts is basically what the Fifth Circuit in

11

this case said that they had done.
QUESTION:

12

13

Are there any cases in which an --

insurance companies that originally bring an action realigned?

14

MR. JUNG:

I'm not aware of any cases in the

15

diversity context where the party who physically brings the

16

suit and files the complaint has been realigned as the

17

defendant.

18

We have that in Skelly Oil in the declaratory

19

judgment cases in federal question jurisdiction, but that

20

rests on some different issues involving -- arising under as

21

used by Congress in 1331.

22

insurance context or otherwise where the party who files the

23

suit in a diversity case has been realigned as a defendant.

24
25

QUESTION:

I'm not aware of any case in the

In diversity when there is a realignment,

then there has to be a reassessment of the residence of the

1

parties.

2

originally brought by could be against if there'd been

3

realignment, although that's not presented here.

4

I assume the same would happen here and that a suit

MR. JUNG:

Well, I suppose that's theoretically

5

possible, Justice Kennedy, but there has been, as I've said --

6

there've been a lot of sorting out of who's adverse to whom.

7

The City of Indianapolis case is a good example of that, but

8

there've been, to my knowledge, no case where you — except --

9
10

went so far with that as to make the person who filed the
suit anything other than a plaintiff.

11

You may have made some other co-parties plaintiff or

12

defendant according to their true interests, but never has the

13

party who under rule 3 commenced the case by filing the

14

complaint with the court been construed to be the party

15

against whom the case was brought.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Is there an overtone of a race to the

courthouse in these circumstances?
MR. JUNG:

Your Honor, unfortunately at some times

19

in Texas workers' compensation litigation, there is a race to

20

the courthouse because even in state court, there can be two

21

different forums that are available.

22

There was no race to the courthouse in this case.

23

Mr. Brewer did not file a state court suit.

24

the direct action proviso makes a suit against an insurance

25

carrier in state court not removable to federal court.

Unfortunately,

And so

1

in that sense, if either party has the option to bring suit

2

and if the out-of-state insurer desires to be in federal

3

court, it's to his advantage to file the suit first, whereas

4

the injured worker may have an advantage in filing in state

5

court first.

6

not the situation in this case.

7

But that's a fairly unusual situation and it's

We believe that the Fifth Circuit's search for

8

symmetry in Campbell was a search for false symmetry.

9

distinction between suits by insurers and suits against

The

10

insurers is rooted in the materially different situations

11

faced by the parties.
The Fifth Circuit's search for fairness in Campbell

12

13

has ironically produced unfairness by affording an

14

unquestionably neutral forum to the injured worker while

15

denying an unquestionably neutral forum to the insurance

16

carrier.

17

And finally and perhaps most importantly --

18

QUESTION:

19

Well, of course, Congress decided that

wasn't all that important in negligence cases.
MR. JUNG:

20

Well, in negligence cases, Your Honor,

21

you still have removal.

In federal — excuse me, in workers'

22

If you review the legislative

Of course, in these cases, I suppose, the

MR. JUNG:

5

It's because it is an insurance company.
Well, there can be that.

If we had filed

this case, though, in the state court in Lamar County, Texas,

7

we would have been in front of an elected judge who depends on

8

people like Mr. Brewer to elect him every four years and who

depends for campaign contributions on the local bar, and we

would have been the insurance company from Chicago.

in which an out-of-state company could stand on an even

Finally, the Court in Campbell overlooked the plain

I would note that in the Horton case in the dissent

Well, that's — that's quite a different

And where Congress said nothing about

MR. FULTS:

Yes, sir.

Campbell, that is recognized even in Greene, that we have a

The language in Hernandez is obviously when they

Why does it contain the language against

I think that Congress has manifested and definitely

If he buys that compensation insurance, he has

QUESTION:

Well, if an employer purchases a health

insurance policy for the employees as a fringe benefit, you
wouldn't call that a liability policy, would you?
MR. FULTS:

No, because there would be no liability

for those health benefits otherwise.

That's a perk.

In our situation the employer very well could have

liability and would whether he's insured or not for an on-the-

compensation scheme he can insure with compensation insurance

20

against that.

Again, I would go to the definition that the Vines

The Court held in Horton that even though the

We would have a race to the courthouse.

We would

have the problem that has already been noted of a

We would also have a delay in the resolution of

claims which is directly contrary to the universally accepted

MR. FULTS:

The employer -- counsel are nodding, and

I'm going to defer.
In Tennessee my understanding is that the employer
must be joined as a party, whereas in Texas you cannot.
QUESTION:

To the extent there are differences

7

between the two states, you would have thought the Sixth

10

there's a stronger case for the -- for your side of it, your

11

side of the case.

12

MR. FULTS:

13

Really, the only basis for the Greene decision is

14

the point that Petitioner raises in argument that this is a

15

case where classical diversity theory should apply.

16

That would be true.

And, for the reasons that I have already talked

17

about -- that being that Congress has abandoned that intent in

18

workers' comp situations — I believe that basis falls from

19

the Greene case.

commences when the employee files the claim, and at that stage

it's an action against the insurance company -- it's just a

continuation of that action?

of the bases of the Campbell holding, that being that this --

Justice Frankfurter makes a point of saying that one

15

party's preference for federal forum is no reason to deny the

17

plain facts of the matter.

18

The plain facts of this matter are that we are

19

talking about a worker injured on the job who by statute has

20

been given what is supposed to be an economical, uniform,

21

expeditious remedy that will be denied to him under the Green

analysis.

Mr. Jung, you have ten minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PETER MICHAEL JUNG
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JUNG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
Although the matter is outside the record, I do feel
the need to respond to Justice Marshall's question.

I have

the Industrial Accident Board award before me, and it amounts
to $56,723.99.

So, this case meets the $50,000 jurisdictional

limitation, even though it was filed at a time when the
limitation was only $10,000.
With respect to the character of workers'
compensation insurance in Texas and its status as liability
insurance, I certainly did not mean to hide the ball in my
opening argument on that point because I believe it's wrapped
up directly with the question of direct action.
In fact if, indeed, liability insurance is an
indemnity agreement and if, in fact, in the state of Texas an
employer is never liable for workers' compensation benefits,
then it follows that a Texas workers' compensation policy is
not an indemnity agreement.
It may protect the employer from other forms of
liability for common law negligence, but it does not indemnify
him for workmen's compensation liability because he has no
such liability.

1

And, for that reason, the key factor of the

2

employer's non-liability goes to both the direct action

3

question and to the question of liability insurance.

4

QUESTION:

Well, can't it be said that he has no

5

liability unless he voluntarily subjects himself to some sort

6

of scheme such as by buying the insurance in which case his

7

liability is substituted by the insurance scheme?

8

MR. JUNG:

9

buys the insurance.

10
11

He does not have any liability even if he
He may obligate the insurance company,

but he does not obligate himself.
And, if a workers' compensation insurer becomes

12

insolvent in Texas, the employer does not become liable for

13

those benefits.

14
15
16

Equally well, an employer could provide any other
form of first-party insurance.
For example, accident insurance.

If I as an

17

employer provide accident insurance for the benefit of my

18

employees, no one would seriously argue that that was

19

liability insurance.

20

What workers' compensation insurance is in Texas is

21

a specialized form of accident insurance protecting the

22

employee for on-the-job injuries, even though the employer

23

would not have been liable for those injuries.

24
25

QUESTION:

Mr. Jung, lots of your -- a major part of

your argument really is unique to Texas, isn't it?

MR. JUNG:

Texas and Washington State.

QUESTION:

So, if we -- we could agree with you

without resolving the conflict, couldn't we?

4

MR. JUNG:

10

QUESTION:

It certainly was no part of the

justification for the Sixth Circuit's decision, which we
thought — with which we thought there was a conflict?
MR. JUNG:

11

Absolutely not, although the Sixth

12

Circuit did focus on the fact the employer and the insurance

13

carrier were jointly and severally liable in Tennessee.

14

Unfortunately the Fifth Circuit did not notice or

15

pay significant attention to that on -- that particular factor

16

of its own state's law in Texas.

In fact, the Respondent argues that Campbell is

right and Greene is wrong.

the Fifth Circuit concerning the Campbell decision.

20

There is serious doubt even within

In this case the Court said that Campbell stands on

should be limited to its facts and has been limited to its

It

5

may well be that the Fifth Circuit chose to merely adhere to

6

its prior precedent unless and until overruled by this court.

7

There is, indeed, a potential race to the

8

courthouse, and it would be disingenuous to deny that such a

9

thing could exist.

But that is an artifact, we submit, of

10

Section 1445(c) which deprived the courts of removal

11

jurisdiction but left the original jurisdiction unaffected in

12

workers' compensation cases.
■»

13
14

And that is true irrespective of what this court
does here today with the direct action proviso.

15

In a suit where the employer, the employee and the

16

insurance carrier are all diverse from one another, that suit

17

may be filed by either party in the federal court system,

18

notwithstanding the direct action proviso, but may not be

19

removed to that court by any party.
And so, 1445(c) creates that race to the courthouse

20

21

irrespective of the circumstances of the direct action

22

provision.

Finally, on the issue of clogging federal dockets, I

24

regret that we did not have modern statistics for the Court,

25

but in the 1958 legislative history, the Court did have — the

1

Congress, excuse me, did have before it the relative frequency

2

of filing of workers' compensation suits in federal courts by

3

insurance carriers in the state of Texas.

4

And those statistics reveal as of that year when the

jurisdictional amount was only $3,000 that less than 2 percent

6

of the workers' compensation cases heard in the Texas federal

7

courts were filed there originally by insurance companies.

So, I think that the fears of overburdened federal
