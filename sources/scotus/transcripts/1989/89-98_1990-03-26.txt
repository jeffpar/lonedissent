CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

United States.

Mr. Lee.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LEE:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

12

At issue in this case is the Federal income tax

13

deductibility of contributions by the parents of Mormon

14

missionaries made directly to the missionaries for the

15

sole purpose of supporting the missionary efforts.

16

common ground that payments to support missionary work of

17

a church that qualifies as charity, such as the Mormon

18

church does, are in general deductible.

19

issue here concerns the means by which those payments are

20

made.

21

It is

And the sole

The crucial language of the statute requires

22

that in order to be deductible payments must be made to or

23

for the use of the church.

24

any method other than undifferentiated payments to the

25

church itself can never, regardless of any other

The government's position that

1

circumstances, be for the use of the church, not only

2

ignores the plain language of the statute, but it also

3

reflects, as does the government's entire brief, a

4

profound failure to recognize even the most fundamental

5

principles and operational aspects of Mormon missionary

6

work as they are reflected in the record in this case,

7

which must in any event be viewed in a light most

8

favorable to Petitioners, against whom summary judgment

9

was entered.
The only reason that the petitioners Harold and

10
11

Enid Davis —

12

QUESTION:

When you say that the record must be

13

viewed in the light most favorable but the petitioners,

14

you just mean any factual evidence that could have been

15

drawn?

16
17
18

MR. LEE:

Excuse me, record, the factual record,

yes, yes.
QUESTION:

And on that point, Mr. Lee, can we take

19

this case as one in which the donations or the payments

20

would not have been made but for the parent-child

21

relation?

22

MR. LEE:

Oh no, no.

You can take it as one that

23

would not have been made but for the fact that they were

24

missionaries.

25

contributions to missionary work other than to their sons

But these very petitioners have made

1

and it most assuredly is not the case that they would not

2

have been made but for the fact that they are their own

3

sons.
QUESTION:

4

Well, if — suppose we had had a trial,

5

and as a factual matter the parents said well, I just want

6

it understood that of course I supported the church and

7

its doctrines and the missionary movement, but the only

8

reason I made these particular payments was the fact that

9

it was my boy that was doing the missionary work.

10

MR. LEE:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. LEE:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. LEE:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. LEE:

It would be —
Would that be, then, a different case?
I don't think so.
So motive isn't irrelevant?
Well —
Or isn't relevant?
The motive to support the church's

17

efforts is very relevant, because it demonstrates that the

18

payments are for the use of the church.
QUESTION:

19
20
21

Well, then, suppose there is a mixed

motive?
MR. LEE:

Then I think you look to what the Tenth

22

Circuit said, what was the, who was the primary

23

beneficiary.

24
25

It is not so much motive that —

QUESTION:

Well, is it the primary motive or the

primary beneficiary?

MR. LEE:

1

It's the primary beneficiary.

It's not

2

so much motive, Justice Kennedy, it is who is the

3

beneficiary, for whose use is it.

4

matter is —
QUESTION:

5
6

And the fact of the

Well, I think those are two different

tests.

7

MR. LEE:

Oh, I think they are.

I think they are.

8

And I think the question is not so much the subjective one

9

of what the motive is, but rather what the use is, which

10

is an objective test.
QUESTION:

11

Mr. Lee, supposing that — then, I am

12

not saying the record does show this, supposing it had

13

showed that for 20 years before their children became

14

missionaries the Petitioners gave $500 a year to the

15

church, and then in the years when their children were

16

missionaries they gave $3,000 or $4,000 a year to the

17

church, or to their children, and claimed a religious

18

deduction.

19

missionaries they went back to giving $500 a year to the

20

church.

21

Then when their children ceased to be

Now, does that make any difference in your case?
MR. LEE:

No, not so long as the difference between

22

the 500 and the amount they gave did not exceed the

23

church's guide — which the church has identified as the

24

amount that is necessary in order to support their work.

25

QUESTION:

Well, in my hypothetical though, they

give a lot more when their children are involved than when
they are not.
MR. LEE:

That is correct.

That is correct.

And

there are —
QUESTION:

But doesn't that show that there is not

a detached motive of generosity for the church?
MR. LEE:

What that shows, Justice Kennedy, is 160

years' worth of history in which the Mormon church prefers
that its missionary work be a total family effort,
including not only the family support, but also including
specifically the direct payment.
And if I may elaborate on that just a bit, these
are reasons that go twice as deep as the history of the
income tax laws themselves, and they are borne out by the
church's amicus brief and by the affidavit of Elder Robert
Backman, who at the time was the executive director of the
missionary work.
Over its 160-year history the church has found that
missionary work has always been family centered, from the
very beginning, with one or more members devoting full
uncompensated time and effort, usually for a period of two
years, while other family members have stayed at home but
have participated through their prayers, their letters and
most significantly, from the very beginning, their
financial support.

1

And what the church has found is that the most

2

effective missionary is one whose efforts are an integral

3

part of a total, largely -- larger family endeavor, and

4

that that contribution to success from the family

5

involvement is more effectively achieved if the missionary

6

each month receives his check direct from his family

7

rather than from the church itself.

8
9

QUESTION:

Mr. Lee, could I come back to your, as I

understand your position it is that the motive doesn't

10

matter, it is just whether the primary effect is to — is

11

for the benefit of the church?

12

MR. LEE:

13

Justice Scalia.

14
15

QUESTION:

That is the way I would read the statute,

Well, then that would mean that if I —

if I am walking along the street, and I'm a compulsive

16

benefactor, and I meet a young man that I take a liking to

17

and I say here, young man, here is $5,000, and that young

18

man turns out to be a Mormon missionary and he uses that

19

to live for the next year as a missionary, then I have a

20

deduction?

21

MR. LEE:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

Most assuredly not.
Well, but the primary effect would be to

support the missionary work of the church.
MR. LEE:

Not because -- no.

The primary effect is

not to support the missionary.

1

And that brings us to another determination that

2

the church has made which is also of more than 100 years'

3

duration, and that is that up to the limits, that there

4

are certain limits which are near survival, they border -

5

- frugality in the extreme, that serves the church's

6

purposes for them to have that much money to do their

7

missionary work.

8

9

Now, if they have money beyond that then they have
time to spend on things like movies, plays and so forth,

10

and their missionary work decreases.

11

consequence, if you were to offer money to a Mormon

12

missionary to support his efforts, if he is doing his job

13

right he would just as politely as possible refuse it.

14
15

QUESTION:

And as a

Why wouldn't he take it and give the

church back the $5,000 that he is using?

16

MR. LEE:

17

QUESTION:

He could if you —
And if he does that, then I would have a

18

tax deduction, even though I don't even know he is a

19

Mormon missionary.

20

MR. LEE:

21

QUESTION:

I gave him $5,000 —

That is correct.

That is correct.

— and he writes back to the church and

22

he says you know, this fellow gave me $5,000.

Here is the

23

money for my missionary support, I am going to use this

24

other money.

And I have a tax deduction, even though I

MR. LEE:

1

That is not for the maximal use of the

2

church.

3

His first job is to talk you out of giving it to him, or

4

to give it directly to the church —

5

7

That is not the way the church wants it done.

QUESTION:

No, you have to take my hypothetical.

He doesn't do that.
MR. LEE:

All right.

I will take your

8

hypothetical.

Here is what he does do then.

He still

9

supports his own efforts on what his family sends him, for

10

reasons that I have just stated.

That is the way he is

11

the most effective missionary.

What he can do is take the

13

QUESTION:

14

15

the Mormon church the money that his parents have given

16

him, and he says here, somebody else has given me money.

17

MR. LEE:

18

QUESTION:

You are not taking my hypothetical.

He accepts the money, he sends back to

All right.
And you really think that I would have a

19

deduction, even though I had no motivation to help the

20

Mormon church at all?

21

MR. LEE:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

He

No, clearly you don't.
Okay, so motive has to enter into it

somehow, doesn't it?
MR. LEE:

I guess there is a relationship between

the motive and -- and it comes from the other end also.

Because what we are really concerned about here is the

2

deductibility to his parents, who of course did make the

3

contribution.

4

objective test, I suppose I have to say, Justice Kennedy,

5

that it is not unaffected by the motive, for reasons that

6

have just been borne out by Justice Scalia's hypothetical.

7

And I think that while it is principally an

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose it's common ground in

8

the government that if, if in the Chief Justice's example

9

the family gave $500 a year to the church and then they

10

gave — and then they send their children $5,000 a year or

11

whatever the amount is — I suppose it's common ground,

12

instead of sending it to them, they gave the church

13

$5,000, that there would be a deduction.

14

MR. LEE:

15

surely hope so.

Well, I would surely hope so.

16

Now, the government's misunderstanding —

17

QUESTION:

I would

So if the church ran its missionary

18

support program differently, took the money itself from

19

the parents, there would be no problem.

20

MR. LEE:

I would certainly hope so.

I can't tell

21

that for sure by reading the government's brief, but I

22

would surely hope so.

23

The government relies principally on a fairly

24

consistent line of lower court cases which involve

25

charities, contribution to charities, but that are

earmarked for particular individuals.

2

lower court cases, they are not binding on this Court.

3

But we hope the Court finds them persuasive, because they

4

solidly favor us and not the government.

5

contributions have been held deductible across a rather

6

broad range, and most notably missionary contributions

7

made to a church, but earmarked for the use of named

8

individuals.

9

Circuit's Winn decision and the tax court's holding in

Now, those are

Some earmarked

And the leading cases are the Fifth

Peace.
The classic case of an earmarked contribution that

12

is not deductible is a contribution to pay the educational

13

expenses of a student, where the donor, rather than the

14

school, designates the recipient.

15

that those —

MR. LEE:

The government says that those donor-selected

That is correct.

tuition earmarking cases are analogous.

But they are

analogous only if you accept the premise on which the

government builds its entire case, and that premise is the

following.

are the missionaries themselves.

If that assumption is

But that assumption bears no

Far from being its beneficiaries, Mormon
missionaries are the church's missionary program.

The

10

church has no other agents by which it carries out its

11

missionary programs, other than these young people who

12

wear white shirts and blouses and go in pairs.

The

13

beneficiaries are the people that they teach.

These

14

people devote two prime-time years, putting everything

15

else on hold, school, social life, dating, family

16

contacts, recreation, everything, not because it will

17

advance any interest of their own, but because of their

religious convictions about the importance of their

message.

Look at the record.

1

Benjamin Davis averaged over

2

70 hours a week in proselyting, plus another 10 in study

3

and preparations to proselyte, and his brother Cecil

4

averaged 60 hours a week proselyting, plus 10 to 25 hours

5

in preparation, which included language study, because he,

unlike his brother, did his proselyting in a foreign

tongue.

other activities were incidental to and in support of

Now, 80 hours a week is hardly incidental.

They

11

for the use of the church.

12

that donations which do nothing more than sustain those

13

proselyting efforts are also necessarily for the use of

14

the church.

15

And it necessarily follows

Harold Davis's affidavit, which is part of the

16

record, states unequivocally that his motive was a sincere

17

religious desire to support the church's missionary

18

program, and that his contributions were subject to a

19

clear understanding and commitment by the sons that the

20

money would be used only in accordance with church

21

guidelines for necessary mission-related expenditures, and

22

was not intended by this — for the sons to use as they

23

might see fit.

but they are religious in nature.

Do we know that from the record?
The record sets that forth, yes.

Those

are church monies.

Once they are devoted, and the record

8

is very clear, Elder Backman's affidavit is very clear on

9

this point.

Once those monies are given to them for that

10

purpose, they are for the use of the church.

11

similarly, if I can just drive that home a little further,

12

there are areas in the world where those guideline amounts

13

there would be some delay in the distribution to charity.

They did not mean that charity would never receive it.

When Congress reenacted this section of the statute in

1954, the legislative history, and again in 1964, the

is no different from here, if you assume — if you assume

that the church would have the right to those funds if the

child abandoned missionary activity.

unable to find anything in the record that would indicate

that in fact the funds would be distributable to the

different?
MS. PETERSON:

If the beneficiaries of that trust

are determined in advance, and there is an understanding
between the charity and the donor that it — in fact, the
funds are going to be used to benefit specific
individuals, then the transfer lacks the indefiniteness
which is the hallmark of a charitable contribution.

MS. PETERSON:

Let me just point out that the lower

court cases that have addressed this question have held
that gifts or transfers to persons who are serving as
missionaries, i.e., providers of services, are treated in
the same way as those for receivers of services.

So that

if — just because someone is serving as a missionary and
is providing missionary services, the money still cannot
be earmarked for that person, or it is not deductible
under Section 170.

The statute is set up to ensure that

the money passes through the hands of a qualified donee.
That is the only way that we can ensure that the public
benefit is advanced, and that the indefiniteness of
beneficiary is ensured.

QUESTION:

I see.

So it would hinge upon whether

that money could be taken out of St. Mary's and sent to

other parishes.
MS. PETERSON:

No, it would hinge on whether or not

11

the priest could use it for the church's general program

12

within St. Mary's parish, or for whatever purpose, but not

13

for a specific individual's benefit.

14

I would just like to point out the possibilities of

15

abuse that may arise if the Court were to accept the

16

taxpayers' exceedingly broad reading of Section 170.

17

First of all, as I mentioned before, if direct payments to

18

individuals were deductible, the Service would be required

19

to scrutinize how the funds were spent, to ensure that a

20

public purpose was served.

Moreover, we would raise the

21

risk of double deductions.

And, as inadvertently occurred

22

in this case, the problem where the parents claimed

23

We have the possibility of shifting deductions

year in which the expenditure is actually made would be

the same as the year in which the payment from the parent

to the child is made.

In short, we believe that the taxpayers' reading of

Section 170 is simply not justified by the statutory

language.

MR. LEE:

I yield to no one, Justice White, in my

I asked you is it in the regulations?

It isn't?
No, no.

(Laughter.)
MR. LEE:

But you can see that in Rockefeller, when

11

it served their purposes to do otherwise, they said there

are many cases other than a trust that can be for the use

of the church.

These people who are — because you can only shift if you

That is just plain not a problem.

QUESTION:

And the only amounts that are going

You can certainly shift small amounts.

It wouldn't do you as much good.

MR. LEE:

Justice Rehnquist, there is no one who is

19

going to be able to live in Washington, D.C. on much less

20

than $310 a month.

21

going to be able to shift is the difference between

whatever in fact they spend and the $310 a month.

And so the only thing that you are

Now, insofar as the double deductions are

concerned, that is equally illusory because of the fact

are college students who take time out from their college.

They don't have anything from which to deduct those

amounts.

QUESTION:

It may be — it may be that the Mormon

church is one example where the -- maybe the problems of

abuse or administration wouldn't be hard, but that might

not be true of all the other situations where these kind

of deductions might be claimed in connection with all

sorts of other churches.
MR. LEE:

But wouldn't it be too bad if we lost

this case and lost 160 years' worth of tradition because

of problems that you might attribute to somebody else?

No, but you wouldn't have any problem.

You would just have — you would then accumulate the total

funds from people to support your missionaries.
