ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID L. SHAPIRO

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

MR. SHAPIRO:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The question in this case is whether a Federal

13

agency can be required to bargain over a union proposal

14

that would subject certain agency decisions with respect

15

to the contracting out of agency work to the grievance

16

procedure of the collective bargaining agreement and to

17

third-party arbitration.

18

the position of the Internal Revenue Service in this case,

19

has been that it cannot be required to bargain over this

20

proposal, that indeed, bargaining over the proposal is

21

precluded by the management rights provision of the

22

Federal Labor Management Relations statute.

23

The agency position, that is,

The union proposal in this case is related t o

24

Circular A-76, issued by the Offic e o f Management and

25

Budget, which is an arm o f the Execu tive Office of the

President.

Circular A- 76 was originally issued in the

2

early -- in the 1950s and has been amended a number of

3

times ever since.

4

on the important matter of Federal procurement.

5

in some detail with the circumstances under which the

6

particular work shall be done inside the agency or shall

7

be contracted out.

It is a statement of executive policy
It deals

8

The Circular specifically states not only that

9

it is designed to give administrative direction to heads

10

of agencies, but, and I quote, that it "shall not

11

establish and shall not be construed to create any

12

substantive or procedural basis for anyone to challenge

13

any agency action or inaction on the basis that it was not

14

in accordance with the Circular, except as specifically

15

provided in the Circular itself."

16

on --

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

The Circular then goes

That last point is really

18

not essential to your principal argument here, though, is

it?

20

provision, even if you were allowed to imply that there

21

might be some binding effect in the courts, your main

22

argument would be unaffected, wouldn't it?

23

Even if it had -- even if it had not included that

MR . SHAPIRO:

Well, the core of our argument,

24

Your Honor, is that Circular A-76 is not an applicable law

25

within the meaning of the management rights provision.

So

1

that if Circular A-76 did confer third-party rights that

2

would be enforceable in court, then that threshold aspect

3

of our argument would be crossed, and you would come to

4

the latter part of our argument that the subject matter of

the Circular is excluded from bargaining by Section 7117 -

(Inaudible) to be the principal part

of your argument.
MR. SHAPIRO:

No, it's really -- I believe it's

10

a subsidiary part.

We r each it really only at the latter

11

point of our brief.

The focus of our argument is really

12

that Circular A-76 is not an applicable law.

13

both arguments.

14

QUESTION:

We do make

Well, Mr. Shapiro, I guess you come

15

close to conceding that the Circular is a governmentwide

16

rule or regulation for purpose of Section 7117.

17

MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes, we do, Your Honor, although

18

we think that question need be reached only if the Court

19

determines that it is an applicable law under 7106.

20

believe, however, that there is a considerable difference

21

between the scope, purpose and language of 7117 on the one

22

hand and the scope and language of 7106 on the other.

23

QUESTION:

We do

Well, it strikes one as a little odd

24

that Congress intended a different meaning for purposes of

25

7103 than it did in 7117.

MR. SHAPIRO:

There are three relevant

2

provisions of this statute, Your Honor.

3

definition of a grievance, in Section 7103, which refers

4

very broadly to any complaint of any violation of a law,

5

rule or regulation.

6

from the scope of bargaining any proposal that is

7

inconsistent with any governmentwide rule or regulation.

8
9

There is the

There is Section 7117, which excludes

Now, it may be that the concept of a rule in
those two provisions is the same.

We content in our brief

10

that it is not.

But it may be that it is.

Congress has

11

indicated in the legislative history that it regards a

12

government policy statement as within the scope of 7117.

13

But the third provision of the act, and the one

14

in which we place our central reliance, is the management

15

rights provision of 7106.

That section does not use the

16

words rule or regulation.

It speaks only of applicable

17

laws.

18

section is very different.

19

And in our view the scope and purpose of that

Now, there is, as I say, a reference in Circular

20

A-76 to an internal appeals procedure within the agency

21

itself that agencies are required to create.

22

internal appeals procedure, as spelled out in the

23

Circular, is not to authorize an appeal outside the agency

24

or judicial review, and it is provided that it may not be

25

subject to negotiation, arbitration or agreement.

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Shapiro, where does the

2

Treasury authority -- get the authority to contract out to

3

begin with?

4

Does it get it from the Circular?

MR. SHAPIRO:

No, I think it is -- I think it is

5

inherent in the agency's appropriations that certain kinds

6

of functions may be performed either in-house or by

7

contracting out.

8

contract out comes from the Circular.

But I don't believe the authority to

The Circular is a statement of policy about how

10

existing authority is to be exercised.

11

in fact purport to preclude contracting out of certain

12

kinds of governmental functions.

13

don't believe, is the source of authority.

14

government's authority to contract out predates the

15

Circular, which goes back only to the 1950s.

16

QUESTION:

The Circular does

But the Circular, I
I think the

Well then, how can negotiating over

17

what is in the Circular affect the authority of the

18

agency, if the authority doesn't get -- if the authority

19

doesn't derive from the Circular?

20

MR. SHAPIRO:

I think the authority of the

21

agency exists even if there were no Circular.

22

Circular is defined -- designed to give the agency

23

direction with respect to the exercise of that authority.

24

And so, when the agency follows A-76, it is making

25

determinations with r es pec t to co nt rac ting ou t .

The union proposal in this case was a proposal,

and I quote it at this point, that the "internal appeals

agreement."

The FLRA has an answer to that argument which we believe

1

proposal is superfluous, that the authority to go to the

2

grievance procedure and arbitration would exist even

3

without it.

4

this case essentially is resolved by the definition of a

5

grievance in Section 7103.

6

concept of a grievance has such a broad definition, any

7

matter relating to subcontracting, in effect, can be taken

8

to arbitration without regard to the management rights

9

provision.

10

In fact, the FLRA's position here is that

They say that because the

Indeed, as I read their argument, they are

11

saying that the definition of a grievance overrides the

12

management rights provision.

13

provision, they say, comes into play only insofar as it

14

may exercise a constraint on the arbitrator's decision.

15

That the arbitrator may not substitute his judgment for

16

that of a Federal agency in matters of discretion.

17

Now, on this score, that is, reading the

That the management rights

19

provisions of the management rights provision, there is a

20

very fundamental disagreement between the FLRA and the

21

Federal agency employer in this case that goes to the

22

heart of the construction and purpose of the statute.

23

believe the FLRA is incorrect for two essential reasons.

24

First of all, the definition of a grievance is

25

very broad.

It covers not only any complaint involving

rights provision, it would be not only that any complaint

of violation of Circular A-76 could be taken to

arbitration, but any complaint about subcontracting, even

if there were no Circular A-76, because, as we concede, a

15

rights provision, Section 7106, which is an essential part

16

of this statute in terms of the very special needs of the

government, states that subject to Subsection {b) of this

guidance of that subordinate, and that it is not designed

to create any third-party rights or enforceable duties.

11

It says specifically that it shall not be construed to

12

create any basis for anyone to challenge any agency

action.

14

Now, it is not simply the evident purpose of the

document that we believe leads to that conclusion, it is

the nature of the document.

QUESTION:

There are very sound, practical

Oh, you need it?

You need it.

Without the proposal you couldn't grieve over this --

6

MR. O'DUDEN:

No, we certainly could.

Let me

7

explain to you why -- why we would want to make such a

8

proposal.

9

incorporate important regulatory provisions right into the

It is common practice in the Federal sector to

10

contract.

11

So much of the employment relationship in the Federal

12

sector, after all, is determined by laws, rules and

13

regulations.

14

administered by lay people.

15

extent to have these very important laws, rules and

16

regulations in the contract so that they can see what the

17

relevant provisions are, so that they can be guided by

18

them.

19

That -- that's just the way things are done.

The contracts are largely enforced and
It helps them to a great

Furthermore, it helps employees because it puts

20

the employer agency on notice that this is a rule

this

21

is a regulation that you are going to have to follow.

22

we hope that it thereby encourages compliance with these

23

kinds of rules and regulations.

And

24

And furthermore, as my friend with the FLRA has

25

already pointed out, it helps avoid future disputes about

l

whether something is arbitrable.

2

practical reasons why we would make such a proposal, and

3

indeed it is every day practice in the Fed eral sector.

4

So there are very sound

Next, let me address the IRS' contention that

5

the applicable laws language in 7106 should be read to

6

have a narrower scope than laws, rules and regulations.

7

We have heard them concede today that the A-76 Circular is

8

indeed a rule within the meaning of the grievance

9

procedu re, but they say that is not good enough.

They

10

suggest that we have to show something more than that.

11

And we would submit that that is untenable.

12

There are many rules, many rules in the Federal

13

sector, for example those in the Federal Personnel Manual,

14

that have always been routinely grievable, but under the

15

IRS' construction of the statute, they would read

16

applicable laws to cancel out the express statutory right

17

to file grievances over those rules.

18

differ ent way, under the IRS' construction of the

19

and we believe it is a rather strange one, it would mean

20

that the agency actually has a right to violate rules and

21

regulations that do not meet its definition of applicable

22

law.

23

untenable view of the statute, indeed.

24
25

To put it a somewhat

And we would say that that is an untenable -- an

l

demonstrate that the Circular was a regulation with the

2

force of law, that is, a substantive rule or a legislative

3

rule, and we would emphasize that we do not believe that

4

that is our burden here, but even if that were correct we

5

would strongly suggest that we meet even that most

6

stringent test.

7

And let me explain why.

First of all, what we have here is a Circular

8

that was issued pursuant to statutory authority.

9

unquestionably binding on executive agenc i es.

It is

They gave

10

notice, they asked for comment, they held hearings and,

11

perhaps most important, they incorporated the provisions

12

of A-76 right into the code of Federal regulations within

13

the subpart that describes the Federal acquisition

14

regulations.

15

regulation, I suppose I am not sure what is.

If that isn't a substantive rule or

16

So, for these reasons we would say that by any

17

stretch of the imagination the A-76 Circular is indeed a

18

law, rule or regulation within the meaning of the

19

grievance procedure, which we would submit controls here,

20

or it is an applicable law even under the IRS' most

21

stringent definition.

Just a few points .
First of all, if the FLRA's position in this

simply superfluous, it is far narrower than the actual

Your Honor, if we start with the

the role the management rights provision plays.

2

understand the Authority's position, it is that all that

3

the management rights provision does is to exercise

4

constraint on arbitrators when they are deciding cases.

5

They should not interfere with managerial discretion.

6

We contend that the management rights provision,

7

when it is fully applicable, must go to the threshold

8

question of grievability, arbitrability, as well as

9

negotiability.

that managerial decisions, whether they are discretionary

11

or not, should not be turned over to a third-party

12

decision maker.
And the -- what happened in the Blytheville

14

case, which is an example of the consequences of that kind

15

of authorization, we believe strongly supports our

16

position.

17

Blytheville case in detail in the only study I know of

25

negotiability but grievability and arbitrability.
