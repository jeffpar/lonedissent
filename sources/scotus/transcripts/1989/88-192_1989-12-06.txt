CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in No. 88-192, McKesson Corporation v. the Division of

Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, et cetera, of Florida.

Mr. Robertson.

ORAL REARGUMENT OF DAVID G. ROBERTSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. ROBERTSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
McKesson has challenged Florida's enactment of a

12

tax scheme that discriminated against interstate commerce

13

in favor of local interests.

14

McKesson maintains that under federal

15

constitutional law the appropriate remedy includes

16

retroactive as well as prospective relief.

17

response has been that its unconstitutional statutes, to

18

use the words of one Florida legislator, should not cost

19

the state even dollar one.

20

Florida's

Florida enacted the unconstitutional statutes in

21

violation of clearly established Commerce Clause law.

22

Florida forced McKesson to pay the discriminatory tax for

23

approximately 23 months while McKesson litigated the

24

constitutionality of the statute.

25

Florida, after McKesson succeeded on its

1

constitutional claim, refused to refund any portion of the

2

unconstitutional taxes.

3

Legislature, after McKesson succeeded, simply replaced the

4

old unconstitutional statute with a new unconstitutional

5

statute.

6

And indeed, the Florida

This Court's first question on reargument asks

7

whether a state whose tax statute violates clearly

8

established Commerce Clause law must provide retroactive

9

relief.

10

McKesson's affirmative answer requires a narrow

ruling on retroactivity.

11

Other states in other cases, where the state has

12

passed a law that does not violate clearly established

13

constitutional law, may have appropriate arguments against

14

retroactive relief.

15

QUESTION:

But Florida in this case does not.
Mr. Robertson, do you take the

16

position that the nature of the relief is limited to a

17

refund of any taxes paid?

18

federal constitution requires the state to give you?

19

MR. ROBERTSON:

Is that the relief that the

We are basing our claim upon

20

this Court's historic interpretations of the Commerce

21

Clause, and we are asking for a very precise equitable

22

remedy.

1

Commerce Clause violation that the state refund all the

2

taxes that you paid under the unconstitutional scheme?
MR. ROBERTSON:

3
4

We think in a situation where a

state has passed a statute that violates —

QUESTION:

Can't you — is that unanswerable?

6

MR. ROBERTSON:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. ROBERTSON:

9

QUESTION:

Sometimes.
Sometimes.

Okay.

MR. ROBERTSON:

10

We would say sometimes.

When the state has passed a law

11

that violates clearly established Commerce Clause law,

12

then the state has no right to rely upon its collection of

13

those revenues, and the state should refund the

14

discriminatory tax.

15

QUESTION:

Well, are we guided by the principles

16

set forth in Milliken against Bradley for devising

17

equitable remedies?
MR. ROBERTSON:

18

The Court is, and in this

19

particular case we think the only remedy that protects the

20

constitutional interest, that protects interstate commerce

21

against protectionist legislation is a retroactive refund,

22

at least where the statute violated clearly established

23

law.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, what — why can't a state

constitutionally limit its remedial scheme to actual

1

damages?
MR. ROBERTSON:

2

We would agree in a case where

3

the state is applying its own state law; it could do that.

4

But in a Federal constitutional case, where the state

5

invokes the Federal Constitution to declare a statute

6

unconstitutional, we believe the state has to apply

7

Federal remedial principles.
QUESTION:

8

9

Well, but Milliken against Bradley

says an equitable remedy need only restore the victims of

10

discriminatory conduct to the position they would have

11

occupied in the absence of that conduct.
MR. ROBERTSON:

12

And in this particular case we

13

are saying that the taxpayers who paid the

14

unconstitutional tax should receive only the

15

discriminatory tax as their refund, not the entire tax.
QUESTION:

16

Well, what if it's been entirely

17

passed on to McKesson's customers so McKesson isn't out a

18

dollar?

19

MR. ROBERTSON:

As the Court recognized in the

20

Bacchus decision at footnote 7, McKesson and any other

21

interstate competitor in a competitive market, whether it

22

passes on all, some or none of the taxes, suffers a severe

23

competitive injury.

24

The Florida Legislature anticipated —

QUESTION:

Yeah, but I'm talking about the

1

principles of Milliken against Bradley that you — you

2

agree should be applied here.

3

MR. ROBERTSON:

We think that the narrow

4

principle that should be applied here is that when an

5

interstate competitor competes in a competitive market and

6

suffers an economic loss as a result of a discriminatory

7

tax, the legislature should not be allowed to enforce that

8

competitive tax either retroactively or prospectively.

9

The Florida legislature knew that McKesson and

10

other interstate competitors would have to pass on that

11

tax by raising its prices and that the inevitable result

12

would be that interstate commerce would lose transactions

13

and the local protected interests would gain as a result.

14

I think that this Court's cases in the antitrust

15

context are illuminating.

16

Brick the Court recognized the difficulties of forcing a

17

plaintiff who is challenging improper conduct to prove the

18

vagaries of pricing decisions.

19

said that the person who is complaining of that injury

20

does not have to prove the exact disruption of the market.

21
22

23

In Hanover Shoe and in Illinois

And the Court in effect

And we think in the constitutional context the
Commerce Clause deserves at least as much protection.
QUESTION:

Could you prove these damages here if

24

were to hold otherwise, if we were to require you to prove

25

the damages?

MR. ROBERTSON:

In fact, we could, and in fact

2

the Florida Supreme Court recognized that.

3

when it resolve the issue of McKesson's standing to bring

4

the action, stated that McKesson in fact had suffered a

5

severe economic injury.

6

The court,

Our products directly competed against the local

7

producers' products and we lost sales as a result of the

8

discriminatory tax.

9

damages remedy, which we're not seeking, would result in a

Indeed, one might argue that a

10

higher recovery than a refund remedy which simply carries

11

out the equitable principles that this Court has applied

12

in earlier tax cases.

13

McKesson submits in this case that Chevron does

14

provide the appropriate standard for permitting state

15

courts to make occasional exceptions to the general rule

16

of retroactivity.

17

Kurtzman, which the Florida Supreme Court cited in

18

passing, parties who justifiably rely upon old law

sometimes'deserve protection.

21

law when the court pronounces a new principle of law.

As the Court noted in Lemon v.

And Chevron permits state

Now, we further submit that that Chevron test,

23

that first prong, should be a threshold test.

24

first prong requires the Court initially to determine

Chevron's

law.
A court, as this Court noted in Hanover Shoe,

2

3

has no reason to confront the theory of retroactivity

4

unless the court has declared a new principle of law.

5

Hanover Shoe characterizes a change in law that

6

would allow a court to use retroactivity principles as an

7

evulsive change which causes the current of the law to

8

pass between new banks.
Now, the state in effect ignores the rationale

9
10

for Chevron.

The state suggests that in any tax case a

11

state court may refuse to give its constitutional ruling

12

full effect in order to avoid a refund of taxes.

13

We think the Court's decisions suggest

14

otherwise.

15

only arise when a decision of law constitutes a new

16

unexpected rule of law.

17

We think the issue of prospectivity should

Twenty other states in their amicus brief

established law.

The only thing I can think of is — is -- is

4

Bivens, I guess.

Do you have anything else?

MR. ROBERTSON:

5

Well, there's — there's, of

6

course, the line of cases where the Court has allowed

7

actions for damages, such as Bivens and Carlson.
In this case, we are not asking you to create an

8
9

action for damages.

We are asking you to utilize the same

10

equitable principles that the Court has exercised whenever

11

taxpayers have challenged state tax statutes on the basis

12

that they conflict with federal law.

13

If you go back as far as Justice Holmes'

14

decision in Atchison, or if you go back to Justice

15

Brandeis' opinion for the Court in Iowa-Des Moines, you

16

see the Court saying that proper relief in a case of

discriminatory taxation involves equal treatment of the

parties.

MR. ROBERTSON:

Mr. Robertson, you may

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:

7

This Court's decision to enforce the Commerce

8

Clause by requiring Florida to refund discriminatory taxes

9

in this case will not grant McKesson a windfall in this

10

case.
The state's windfall argument ignores that the

11

12

Florida Supreme Court determined that McKesson had

13

suffered a substantial economic injury.

14

products from other nations and other states directly

15

competed with favored Florida products.

against Florida vodka.

California that directly competed with Florida wine

In the face of that competition, McKesson could

21

not raise its prices to cover the discriminatory taxes and

22

retain its original market share.

23

absorb all or most of the increased price and retain its

24

original market share, or McKesson could raise its prices

25

to cover the discriminatory tax and lose market share.

McKesson could either

Under either economic scenario McKesson suffered

a significant economic injury.

The state's —

4

QUESTION:

Well, of course, all that depends on

5

inelasticity or elasticity of demand in a very — really

complex inquiry, doesn't it?

MR. ROBERTSON:

QUESTION:

It depends —

Especially when you're talking about

MR. ROBERTSON:

10

That is correct, and that's why

11

we submitted the affidavits of a professor of economics

12

from Stanford and a viticologist from Davis to

13

demonstrate, along with our own personnel's affidavits,

14

that we had suffered a significant injury.

15

QUESTION:

Of course, it ill-behooves Florida to

16

say that it didn't — it didn't cost you sales since the

whole object of it was to cost you sales.

MR. ROBERTSON:

QUESTION:

14

That's one of the two reasons why we
The other reasons, of

So how are you up here is what I'm

saying?
MR. ROBERTSON:

15

We're up here because we believe

16

that irrespective of the Eleventh Amendment this Court

17

retains the jurisdiction to make final determinations

18

concerning state court treatment of Federal law.
In other words, we would view the Eleventh

19
20

Amendment, of course, as affecting the Federal courts'

21

original trial court jurisdiction.

22

over the long history of this Court the Court has ever

23

viewed the Eleventh Amendment as restricting its right to

24

make final determinations on Federal constitutional

25

issues.

We do not believe that

1

I'm asking you for a case where —

2

where we've done that and where it wasn't the state that

3

initiated the suit, and where it was only money damages

4

involved in the suit and not an injunction.
MR. ROBERTSON:

5

Well, I think even if you go

6

back to the case of — a Commerce Clause case, Best v.

9

to a refund.
And I think in other cases such as Halliburton,

In that particular case, the Court reversed a

indeed, and in a recent case —

12

QUESTION:

Is that in your brief?

13

MR. ROBERTSON:

Yes.

Yes, it is.

Best?
In cases such

14

as Halliburton and Texas Monthly, indeed in the case — in

15

cases as recent as Allegheny Pittsburgh, the Court has

16

never suggested — and Justice Stevens has made this clear

17

in some of his Eleventh Amendment dissenting opinions, the

18

Court has never suggested that it does not have

19

jurisdiction to consider state court treatment of Federal

20

constitutional issues.

21

If it were otherwise, we would have 50 states

22

making constitutional determinations that would not be

23

subject to review, at least with respect to damages

24

issues.

right to recover something.

MR. ROBERTSON:

MR. ROBERTSON:

7

QUESTION:

I mean, your client.

We believe that that —

An individual right.
We believe that's the case.

Well, why is it a right for

8

restitution of the taxes as opposed to the actual damages

9

that were suffered?

10

The competitive injury damages?

MR. ROBERTSON:

As a matter of history and as a

11

matter of equity, I think that the Court has, in cases

12

such as Iowa-Des Moines, simply seen that as the most

13

precise way of correcting the constitutional infirmity.

14

don't think —

QUESTION:

If you were — if you were applying

16

the Milliken v. Bradley factors, you wouldn't necessarily

come to that conclusion, would you?

In other cases you might not.

MR. ROBERTSON:

QUESTION:

But in others you might not.
That's correct.

Perhaps not here.

Now, what if this

refund of taxes.

I

1

the issue of sovereign immunity is not really an issue.

2

think that if the state did not provide a remedy, this

3

Court's power to enforce and protect the Commerce Clause

4

would allow it to create a remedy so that that structural

5

provision which does generate benefits for interstate

6

competitors would be effective.

7

Right now the states are watching this case and

8

looking for guidance.

9

have been very responsive to parochial pressures.

Historically, state legislators
They

10

see little reason to resist the temptation to shift taxes

11

to other states.

12

Only retroactive tax decisions will cause

13

legislators to consider the constitutionality of their

14

legislation.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

I take it you say such a remedy would

override the Eleventh Amendment.
MR. ROBERTSON:

Since we have brought the action

18

in state court, not Federal court, we think that we would

19

have a right to proceed with that — with that attempt at

20

equitable relief against the state.

QUESTION:

I'd like to —

future they'll be taxed a little higher.

10

use retroactive taxation to cure unconstitutional

taxation.
QUESTION:

12

No, I'm not talking about retroactive

taxes.

14

not sure that they constitutionally can simply write you a

letter saying, by the way, you're being taxed for activity

I'm

That's at least some problems.

But suppose, instead of that, Florida says you

ORAL REARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR, III

15

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

18

MR. FARR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice; may it

please the Court:
As we see it, the issue in this case is whether

19

Petitioner, who brought a state cause of action in state

20

court, is entitled to a particular remedy, a refund from

21

the state treasury, as a matter of Federal law.

22

We think the answer is that McKesson is not

23

entitled to that refund for several reasons, two of which

24

I'd like to emphasize this afternoon.

25

First of all, we think that in a state cause of

1

action for monetary relief against the state, a state

2

court can generally apply its own remedial principles so

3

long as they are not arbitrary or discriminatory.
Second, we think that even if Federal principles

4
5

did apply here, they wouldn't require the state courts to

6

give a windfall to a taxpayer who would have paid the same

7

tax with or without the unlawful provision, passed on the

8

tax to its customers and suffered, at most, a minor

9

competitive injury for which it has expressly not sought

10

relief.
Now, I'd like to step back at the outset and

11
12

just bring into focus what is and isn't at issue in this

13

case.

14

All that Petitioner has chosen to do here is to

15

bring a state cause of action for a tax refund.

There is

16

no question in this case, therefore, of a state court

17

providing an inadequate remedy in a Federal cause of

18

action.

And I think that's an important distinction.
State courts generally are not able to limit

19
20

remedies in Federal causes of action, such as Section 1983

21

actions.

22

23
24
25

That's what this Court held in Felder v. Casey.
But at least since Erie it has generally been

the opposite when a state creates the cause of action.

he?

3

MR. FARR:

Your Honor, I do not understand him

4

to assert that.

And, let me say, if he is asserting that,

5

he's then wrong for a different reason because there is no

6

Federal cause of action that applies against the state

7

itself and the state treasury for damages in these

8

situations.

QUESTION:

For a void tax?

10

MR. FARR:

That's correct.

11

QUESTION:

For a wrongful tax.

What about our -

12

- our opinion in First English which says that you have an

13

automatic Federal cause of action for a taking?

14

MR. FARR:

First English is a case that involves

15

the takings clause, and as I understand it, the takings

16

clause is the only clause in the Constitution in which

17

this Court has said there is an automatic remedy for

18

damages that flows from the — from the particular

19

provision itself.

20

22

QUESTION:

Oh.

And if you call it a tax, it's

not a taking?
MR. FARR:

It is not a taking.

There is no

suggestion here, Your Honor, that this claim has ever been

24

brought under the takings clause.

MR. FARR:

4

Not in First English.

You're right.

5

But even if — even if First English — the logic of that

6

was extended to states, there has never been a claim here

7

that this is a takings claim.

8

brought as a takings claim is simply not an issue right

9

now.

10

Whether it could have been

But the Federal cause of action, of course, that

11

most typically applies in the case of a constitutional

12

violation is Section 1983 and, as the Court held last

13

term, that is not a statute that provides a cause of

14

action against states themselves, or state officials in

15

their official capacity.

16

And even the implied causes of action, the

17

Federal causes of action that this Court has implied

18

directly from the Constitution, leaving out the takings

19

clause for a second — such as Bivens, for example —

20

applies only against individual officers in their

21

individual capacities.

One of the

the other side of this coin is when can a Federal court

entertain a cause of action seeking to enjoin a state tax

3

and avoiding the Tax Injunction Act by saying the Florida

4

law is inadequate?
Would you say that whenever the Florida remedy

5
6

is less than complete that that means the taxpayer can

7

always go into Federal court?

8

MR. FARR:

9

I don't think so, Your Honor, but I

don't think that is the issue here in all honesty.

I

10

think what the Florida Supreme Court said is not that we

11

don't provide any refunds or that we don't provide any

12

refunds if there is a Federal right involved.

13

What it said is we are not going to provide a

14

refund in this case because of equitable considerations,

15

in particular the fact that this was a tax that was passed

16

on.

17

Now, it doesn't seem to me that there is

18

anything arbitrary or irrational about that rule, or

19

anything that closes the Federal — excuse me, the state

20

courts to claims against their tax statutes based on

21

Federal law, simply because a particular litigant lost on

22

that basis.

where there is a claim that local law has been violated?

2

We just deny a refund for equitable reasons?
MR. FARR:

3

Yes.

In fact, that's the particular

4

case that the — one of the two cases that the Florida

5

Supreme Court cited.

6

was brought solely under state law and in a state cause of

7

action, and the Court held no refund was appropriate in

8

that case for, as it said here, equitable consideration.

QUESTION:

The Galesian case is the case that

But do they have any — do you have

any pass-on cases under state law?
MR. FARR:

11

Well, the pass-on case that is most

12

noted under state law is the Szabo case in which the Court

13

held that if you have passed on the tax, you don't have —

14

you are not entitled to get a refund.

question that is addressed, in any case, is whether this

We are not suggesting, Justice Scalia, that

18

there is not the possibility of some competitive injury

19

when a tax is passed along.

20

When a distributor simply adds the tax to the

21

price of the product and passes it along to the customer,

22

it is possible that the distributor will lose market

23

share.

about that.

brought in this particular case.
damages for loss of market share.

McKesson did not seek
And if it did, it would

have had to bring an entirely different cause of action
because that is not covered by the state's action for a
tax refund.
Secondly, if it did lose market share, to be
perfectly honest, it couldn't have lost much because the
market for the local products is essentially 2 percent of
the entire market of sales and whatever part of that
McKesson might have gotten, all the other distributors of
interstate products would have been entitled to fight for
it as well.
So, the idea that their claim for a tax refund
is somehow a surrogate for a competitive injury claim
simply would not stand up on the facts of this case.
Indeed, they conceded that at the first argument.
QUESTION:

Well, is there some cause of action

under Florida law in which the taxpayer could sue the
State of Florida for damages rather than a refund?
MR. FARR:

Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think

there is an action under Florida law.

I think McKesson,

had it wanted to bring that suit, would have had to bring
a 1983 suit, the normal — cause of action for Federal
constitutional claims, against individual defendants for
damages for loss of competitive position.

It chose not to bring that suit, however.

QUESTION:

The state —

3

QUESTION:

(inaudible.)

4

MR. FARR:

That's correct.

That is the standard

5

form of cause of action and remedy for a violation of a

6

Federal constitutional right.

7

suit, there is no question — and certainly no question

8

after the decision in Will last term — that they could

9

not have brought that suit against the State of Florida or

10

11

And had it brought a 1983

against its officials in their official capacity.
Just to return for a moment to the point about

12

the state cause of action because I think it's helpful

13

perhaps if I provide an example.

14

If, for example, the state had a statute that

15

said if one of the state officers causes any injury to any

16

person, violates any rights — state, Federal, makes no

17

distinction — you may sue the state directly and obtain

18

damages from the state treasury, but you may not obtain in

19

that cause of action punitive damages and perhaps, let's

20

say, there's a cap on damages for emotional distress.

21

We don't think that a plaintiff could come in,

22

sue under that cause of action, establish, let's say, the

23

violation of a Federal right, and then say we want

24

punitive damages, or we want a million dollars in damages

25

for emotional distress.

The state can properly say in this cause of

1
2

action that we have provided — there's nothing arbitrary

3

about these limits — those are the limits of that cause

4

of action.

5

Now, that doesn't mean that the plaintiff

6

couldn't have brought a 1983 action based on the same

7

conduct against the individuals.

8

it would be entitled to punitive damages.

And under Smith v. Wade,

9

But what the Petitioner here is trying to do is

10

essentially mix and match, say, we have brought the state

11

cause of action and now we want to just bring in a Federal

12

rule that overrides any limits that the state courts might

13

put on the remedy and obtain a refund.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Farr, if the state legislature

15

acts clearly arbitrarily and in clear violation of the

16

Commerce Clause in enacting a particular provision, with

17

every reason to know and understand it's unlawful under

18

the Federal Constitution, and if the taxpayer pays the

19

unlawful tax under protest and then subsequently it is

20

judicially determined that yes, indeed, the law was

21

invalid and that these taxes were paid under protest, is

22

it your view that nonetheless the state may refuse to

refund the taxes and that's reasonable?

Court and I'd like to keep them separate for purposes of

2

answering your question.
I do believe that if the state found, for

3
4

example, that the tax had been passed on or that there

5

were other good equitable reasons even in that situation,

6

certainly in a state cause of action under my first

7

argument the state could, still under those conditions,

8

impose a limit on the refund.

9

QUESTION:

10

What — what is the test?

Is it

whether that's arbitrary or reasonable?
MR. FARR:

11
12

But — I'm sorry.

That's right.

Whether it would be so

arbitrary under those circumstances.

13

Under the second point, which is essentially

14

applying the Federal remedial standards of Milliken v.

15

Bradley, we think all of those things obviously are

16

factors.

17

The nature of the particular violation we have

18

conceded is a factor, and if the law is clearly

19

established, that is one factor.

20

that once you have crossed that first question there still

21

is -- the major question is what exactly is the injury

22

here and what is the proper remedy for that injury.

There simply isn't a cause of action, even if

5

the state legislature acts clearly in violation of the

Equal Protection Clause —

7

QUESTION:

Well, suppose —

8

MR. FARR:

— that provides that remedy.

9

QUESTION:

— you conclude that under Milliken

10

against Bradley the most reasonable remedy is damages for

11

the injury to competition, but the state doesn't provide

12

that — all it provides is a tax refund law?

13

enter into the equation then on what's reasonable?

14

MR. FARR:

Does that

I don't believe it does because that

15

is a cause of action that could have been brought.

16

Indeed, I think this is an important point.

17

I don't think that a plaintiff is entitled to

18

try to put a reviewing court essentially into a box where

19

it says, I have not sought relief for the injury I really

20

suffered, if any.

21

may have lost a few sales to these local products, but I

22

haven't sued for that.

23

if I don't get a tax refund, I'm not going to get any

retroactive relief.

is that had you brought the proper suit, or if you could

2

still bring the proper suit, the proper approach is to

3

bring that claim and then, as Justice Kennedy points out,

4

it would have to be tested by all of the usual ways in

5

which you test a cause of action.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Farr, why isn't it proper for the

7

taxpayer to sue for the refund and the state responds by

8

saying, well, the tax had probably been passed on so at

9

least part of it is a windfall?

10

Would the proper response be to say to the

11

extent that there is a windfall element here, we will cut

12

the refund down to 40 percent or 3 percent, or whatever it

13

might be?

14

I don't see how that can justify no — no refund

15

at all, just because you're not entitled to a hundred —

16

100 percent refund.

Well, I think the question —

asked for more than you're entitled to?
MR. FARR:

about here, is the amount of the relief.

The want an

7

it the refund is that to a certain extent it's windfall.

8

But that's a reason for giving less than 100 percent, not

9

a reason for denying relief entirely, it seems to me.

10

MR. FARR:

Well, Justice Stevens, let me add one

11

more thing to this.

I think that in fact even if this tax

12

hadn't been passed on, it would have been a windfall in

13

one sense.

14

taxpayer is what tax would the taxpayer have paid had the

15

system been constitutional.

16

Which is that the particular question for the

QUESTION:

And that's another reason for

17

reducing the amount, but it's not a reason for reducing it

18

to zero.

Well, it may be.

prohibited from collecting.

3

be able to retain that because they framed their remedy

4

incorrectly.

5

MR. FARR:

And you're saying it ought to

Well, Justice Stevens, I just frankly

6

look at that differently from the way you're looking at

7

it.

8
9

Let me explain why.
The flaw in this tax statute was not that the

state took in money that it shouldn't have taken in.

The

10

flaw in the tax statute is that it provided a very small

11

preference —

12

QUESTION:

Right.

13

MR. FARR:

— for a number of local products.

14

In fact, by providing that preference the state didn't

15

take in any more money.

16

would have taken if the preference hadn't been in the

17

statute at all.

18

than it would have paid if that preference hadn't been in

19

the statute at all.

20

It took in less money than it

And Petitioner didn't pay any more money

As we suggested at the first argument, if

21

Petitioner had gotten the same injunction it got the day

22

before the tax statute took effect, it would have paid

23

precisely the same amount of taxes it paid.

24
25

Now, their answer to that, as I understand it,
is well, that may be true, maybe we would have paid the

1

same amount of taxes, but maybe we would have had some

2

more sales.
All I'm saying is that is a different nature of

3
4

injury.

That's not the question of how much damages for

5

the same injury.

6

they sued for.

That's a different injury than the one

If I could just address one other thing quickly.

7
8

The basic understanding that I have of their position is

9

that this refund is necessary because it will rein in

10

legislatures who act unconstitutionally.

And I'd just

11

like to make two very quick points about that.
First of all, that is an argument that can be

12

13

made in every case, of course, where there's a

14

constitutional violation by a state.

15

procedure, the standard cause of action and the standard

16

remedy that is provided in such situations is a cause of

17

action in damages against the individual state defendants,

18

not against the state itself.

Yet, the standard

Secondly, at least in Florida, the remedy of

19
20

seeking to enjoin taxes before they take effect is fully

21

in effect.

22

kind of relief.

23

There is no barrier in Florida to seeking that

And therefore, for example, if petitioner

24

thought that what was happening in Florida — and it

25

obviously does think this — is that Florida's simply just

1

passing the same statute over and over again, petitioner

2

could go in and get another injunction before a new

3

statute took effect or, indeed, it could have, I believe,

4

gone in and gotten its old injunction extended to the new

5

statute saying that collection of taxes under this new

6

statute was essentially no different from collecting the

7

taxes under the old statute.

8

But it didn't do that.

And, in fact, if it had

9

done that — the point I was just discussing with Justice

10

Stevens -- there is no possibility that it would have had

11

a claim for a refund because all that would have happened

12

would have been that the exemptions, the preferences,

13

would have been struck from the statute and petitioner

14

would have paid exactly the same amount of tax.

15

QUESTION:

Your argument in essence — this

16

particular argument is that Florida doesn't need to do

17

anything, the Florida Supreme Court didn't need to even

18

give an equitable reason for denying the refund.

have not been hurt in that sense.

Supreme Court on the grounds that it could have just

QUESTION:

Well, I know, but —

MR. FARR:

— making at the beginning.

QUESTION:

— it would certainly avoid all the

argument about the amount.

MR. FARR:

Well, I think that the question is

not whether the Florida Supreme Court could have simply

Then there would have been the questions as to

11

perhaps whether the ground for that was — because they

have been discriminatory.

Well, what if they say — what if

sustainable judgment of the Florida Supreme Court,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID G. ROBERTSON

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROBERTSON:

3

Hypothetically, if the state had

4

taxed McKesson and the favored local producers at the same

5

rate, McKesson would not have suffered any injury and

6

would not be in court today.

7

taxed McKesson at a higher rate than it taxed the favored

8

competitors.

legislature intended, McKesson suffered a competitive

But, in fact, the state

And, as a result of that, just as the

injury.
QUESTION:

Well, that may be -- that may be so,

but it didn't pay more taxes than it should have.
MR. ROBERTSON:

It paid more taxes in the sense

that this Court in cases like Iowa-Des Moines has said

that there is a right to equal treatment.

I'd — I'd just like to give a slight overview
of Florida's view of equities.

on the merits in the circuit court, refused to enjoin the

We went in and said, put this in effect so there
