MR. KNEEDLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The court of appeals, in this nationwide class

12

action, invalidated the central regulatory requirement

13

that has governed eligibility for children's disability

14

benefits since, the outset of the Supplemental Security

15

Income program in 1974.

16

that in order to qualify for benefits a child must have an

17

impairment or a combination of impairments that is

18

included in the Listing of Impairments in the regulations,

19

or is equal in severity to a listed impairment.

20

The regulation at issue provides

We submit that the court of appeals erred for four

21

reasons in invalidating these regulations on their face.

22

First, the regulation Respondents challenge is supported

23

in a number of respects by the text and legislative

24

history of the definition of disability in Title XVI.

25

Second, the regulation requiring that a children's

in 1974 at the outset of the SSI program.

represents a contemporaneous interpretation of the act by

4

those charged with its initial implementation, and a

5

consistent and long-standing interpretation of the act as

well.

7

It therefore

Third, Congress ratified this regulatory requirement

8

that Respondents challenge in 1976, soon after the SSI

9

program got underway.

Specifically, in the 1976

10

unemployment compensation amendments, Congress directed

11

the Secretary to publish the objective criteria that he

12

was then developing internally to implement the

13

regulation, and to use those criteria to determine

14

disability.

15

utilized for children were issued the following year,

16

pursuant to that statutory directive and special

17

delegation of legislative rule-making authority.

18

And the special Part B Listing of Impairments

And fourth, the Secretary's regulatory approach

19

adheres to the functional orientation of the Social

20

Security Disability programs.

21

children can also qualify under, is principally

22

applicable, or was designed for adults, and it identifies

23

those impairments which the Secretary has determined would

24

render an adult unable to work, which is itself obviously

25

a functional predicate for the Listing.

The Part A Listing, which

The Part B Listing has the same thrust.

2

fleshing out the statutory standard of comparable

3

severity, the Secretary, after a two year study in the

4

initial implementation of the SSI child's program, with

5

the aid of physicians and other experts, identified those

6

impairments that have an impact on a child's growth and

7

development that is comparable to the effect that an

8

impairment has on an adult's ability to work.

9

the Part B Listing carries forward the functional

18

Yes.

Isn't a functional evaluation often a

necessary predicate to making a medical diagnosis?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, and the way in which this program

19

is implemented, in fact, provides for a functional

20

assessment in many circumstances.

21

QUESTION:

Well, if it makes it to the list.

22

guess you would acknowledge that there are children with

23

impairments that aren't on any of the Secretary's lists.

mean, there are two points about that.

One is, of the —

2

if the impair — if the specific impairment is not listed,

3

if the specific criteria for the impairment are not

4

listed, the child can still establish that he meets the

5

level of severity set forth in the Listings by showing

6

that he — that his particular impairment equals a listed

7

impairment.

8

something to the Listings, what the decision-maker has to

9

do is look for the medical signs and findings and symptoms

And in determining that, in matching

10

of the impairment.

11

would be the functional limitation imposed on the child as

12

a result of his impairment.

13

limitations match the level of severity in the Listing, he

14

will be found eligible.

QUESTION:

If — if it were an adult being considered

for disability benefits, steps 4 and 5 of the evaluation

MR. KNEEDLER:

19

Well, the principal thrust of steps 4

not disabled, and that would — we'll put that to one

QUESTION:

I understand, but would you agree with me

2

that those steps, for adults, appear to pick up some

3

people who aren't on the lists?

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

It may pick up some people, but this

5

gets to the point I was going to make.

6

— that an adult would be found disabled at step 5 would

7

typically be, not because of the severity of his

8

impairment standing alone, but because he, in addition,

9

has an adverse non-medical factor, a — an adverse

vocational factor.

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

As to that, Justice O'Connor, I — the

4

Respondents and some of the amici, I think, have a

5

misapprehension about the way the Listing works.

6

Listing is not a listing of diseases.

7

mental and physical impairments.

13

do is identify impairments in the body system.

14

impairment might be due to a variety of different

15

diseases.

16

For example, the ability to move a

What the Listings
Any one

17

brief, Down syndrome children are typically quite mentally

supplemental brief, with Down syndrome is most Down

22

23

such as a digestive problem or something of that sort,

24

then you would look to that body system listing to see

whether the effect of the impairment on that body system

1

renders him disabled.
So, the fact that a particular disease is not listed

2
3

as such under the Listings is really beside the point.

4

And again, the statutory definition of disability for an

5

adult refers to an individual who has a physical or mental

6

impairment, that he is unable to engage in substantial

7

gainful activity by reason of a physical or mental

8

impairment, which is the effect on the body's ability to

9

perform, not the medical diagnosis of a particular

10

disease.

11

And for children, I -- in further response to Justice

12

O'Connor's question, for children the statutory standard

13

in the parenthetical at the end of the statute —of the

14

statutory definition of disability is for a child with a

15

mental or physical impairment of comparable severity.

16

other words, for adults the standard of disability is

17

defined in terms of — the ultimate question is ability to

work.

19

activity by reason of his impairment.

20

ultimate question is that by — unable to work by reason

21

of impairment, the disability to work.

22

Is the adult unable to perform substantial gainful
In other words, the

QUESTION:

So, under your view, the phrase, with

3

reference to adults, unable to engage in any substantial

4

gainful activity, is just irrelevant with respect to the

5

child?

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

7

QUESTION:

8
9

It is not irrelevant in terms of —

Are you reading it out of the statute as

to the child?
MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

In terms of measuring, in terms

10

of ascertaining what the phrase comparable severity means,

11

what the Secretary did was to look at what is comparable

12

in children to performing substantial gainful activity in

13

adults.

14

to the '77 regulations, what the Secretary has explained

15

is that in children the primary life activity isn't work,

16

as it is for adults, but it's development and growth.

17

therefore the Secretary identified in the — in the

18

special Listing for children the impairments that have an

19

effect on development and growth in children that is

20

comparable to the effect on the ability to perform

21

substantial gainful activity in adults.

22

And as we point out in our brief, in the preamble

MR. KNEEDLER:

1

Right.

For example, the Part A

Secretary has determined would render an adult unable to

work.

5

even though the measurement of the severity of the

6

impairment could be described as a medical measurement,

and that is the way in which it's typically referred to,

it does take into account functional impacts.

It is still not clear to me, if you don't

3

What the Secretary has done in the Listings, though,

4

is to say — the statutory phrase comparable severity is

very general, and what Congress — what the Secretary did

pursuant to Congressional authority, is to try to give

content to that standard of comparable severity.

reaching 18 he could?

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, I -- this — this exchange

is bringing out what has puzzled me.

You say it is an

impairment comparable to one that would render an adult
disabled.

But what you have just demonstrated is that

that is not an absolute.

It depends on the adult.

Which

adult are you using for your comparability analysis here?
An adult who has a lot of skills, or an adult who has
little skills?
MR. KNEEDLER:

I think your question highlights the

difficulties with Respondents position.
QUESTION:

Are you using a middle aged adult as your

standard, or an elderly adult?
MR. KNEEDLER:

The comparable, the touchstone is the

disabled.

— excluding a functional assessment.

The — an adult who might be found disabled not on the
basis of impairment alone, but on the basis of his
advanced age or inadequate job training or education, that
is not a person — his impairment — his impairment may
not be of comparable severity, would not be.

Because the

Listings are intended to match comparable severity of
children's disability, or children's impairments and

adults.

It is when you go beyond that, and typically the

2

adult would be found disabled for some other reason.

3

it is not — it is not an impairment that you could

4

confidently conclude in that situation would render an

5

adult disabled, on the basis of the impairment alone.

So

6

QUESTION:

I think I understand.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. — let me just clear up one thing in

8

my mind, Mr. Kneedler.

In step 5, in the adult situation,

9

as you describe it, you often rely on non-medical factors,

10

that are — poor job training or age or something like

11

that.

12

that the determination could be based entirely on medical

13

factors, none of - which itself was sufficient under the

14

Listings on — in step 3.

15

But is it not possible, in step five for adults,

MR. KNEEDLER:

It's — it's conceivable.

I mean, the

16

progression — the progression would contemplate that that

17

should happen.

18

interact, step — the Listings are intended to identify

19

those impairments that would enable you to conclude that

20

the person is disabled solely because of his —

But the way the Listings and step 5

21

QUESTION:

Correct.

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

— his impairment.

The latter steps

23

are designed to factor in the age, education and work

24

experience.

QUESTION:

Yes, but they also, it seems to me, factor

in the possibility that there is a combination of three or

four factors, none of which in itself is sufficient to

meet the standards on the step 3 list.

MR. KNEEDLER:

be considered, at step 3 of the Listing as well.

impairments and compare it to the impairment that is most
similar.

You look at what expression of impairments

predominates, is it mental retardation with maybe
secondary physical problems or vice versa.

Depending on

which one predominates, you look at that listing, and then
you take into account additional functional limitations
imposed by the second — the additional or the multiple
impairments and see whether they rise to the level of
impairment severity set forth in the Listing.
Because, again, the statutory touchstone is
comparable severity, the severity of the impairment, not
residual functional capacity, what the individual can do
despite his impairment.

So the Listings specifically do

take into account the concern you are raising, of multiple
impairments.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, the Respondents say that the

Secretary has interpreted Regulation 83-19, or applied it,
in such a way that it just doesn't consider functional
impairment.

And I understood from your brief the

something?

Respondents' misconstruction.

5

based on what they perceive to be the language of the

6

regulation, which they say precludes consideration of

7

functional impair — functional limitations resulting from

8

an impairment, in deciding whether something equals the

9

10

Respondents' allegation is
As I understand their

The Secretary does not construe his own interpretive

11

ruling in that way, and under Udall v. Tallman the

to make pertains to children as well.

And this

It says medical equivalency permits a physician to

arrive at a judgment that the findings, although not

would be that, in deciding equivalency, you can see

whether the child's impairment, although not listed, has

the same impact on his ability to perform the sorts of

functions to which that body system relates as a listed

14

And the other point I would make, that we also point

out in our supplemental brief, is that the — Secretary,

through SSA, undertook a study of the child's disability

discovered certain areas where the Secretary thought that

as to those that were found not to equal the Listing,
erroneously, they were almost exclusively based on the
failure to consider how all documented impairments
combined to affect the child's overall functional
capacity.

So the Secretary, in evaluating decisionmaking

by lower — by — in the sample of cases that were
obtained, specifically reaffirmed the idea that this —
that the equivalency concept is not construed or applied.

that children were to be treated in such a way that if

they had an impairment or combination of impairments of

comparable severity to that which would disable an adult,

22

It is our belief, and it is adequate — amply

difficulty dealing with children who have impairments that

combine a number of different factors, or that are not on

the list — on the very short list that the Secretary has.
QUESTION:

4

Well, Mr. Weishaupt, the — Mr. Kneedler

5

says that the equivalence determination takes care of

6

that.

7

MR. WEISHAUPT:

8

QUESTION:

Yes.

And I think you better address yourself to

9

that, that the Secretary's interpretation is that the

10

equivalence determination allows consideration of the

11

functional impact of even multiple conditions.

12

MR. WEISHAUPT:

The Secretary's interpretation, as

13

promulgated by Ruling 83-19, which is the only thing on

14

paper that addresses the question of equivalence, quite

15

simply states that functional consequences are not to be

16

determined.

17

appendix page 240, "The functional consequences of

18

impairments, irrespective of their nature or extent,

19

cannot justify a determination of equivalence."

20

quite frankly, is at the heart of this case.

21

Secretary does not have an adequate means with which to

22

address the difficult cases.

23

To quote briefly from that ruling, at joint

I

1

have a combination of impairments, or who have a rare

2

disease, that simply does not come on the Listing or that

3

have an atypical amount of functional loss.

4

The Secretary's argument seems to be, at least

5

insofar as the Listings incorporate function, it seems to

6

be that the Listings represent the Secretary's estimate of

7

the typical impact of an impairment upon the typical case.

8

But that is not the way that the Social Security Act is

9

supposed to function.

The Social Security Act is supposed

10

to function in order to make case-by-case determinations

11

of each individual, not only looking at that child as an

12

individual and matching his findings up with the Listings,

13

but also to determine how those impairments actually

14

affect that particular child, what that child can do and

15

what that child cannot do.

16

I think a good illustration of the problems that the

17

Secretary has with more rare diseases is found in the

18

Wilkinson case, which is — which is cited in both our

19

briefs.

that he ran fevers three or four times a week, that he

He was also,

The Secretary's defense of

There is no doubt that an adult in that case

QUESTION:

If the Secretary took out the language

8

there, in that Regulation 83-19, so that a medical — a

9

medical equivalency determination also looked to

10

functional impairment, would there be anything left of

11

your case?

12

MR. WEISHAUPT:

That would go a long way toward

13

resolving the problems that we have with the Secretary's

14

approach.

15

Listings for children are modeled to reflect exactly the

16

same degree of impairment that is used for adults, in that

17

process that is used for adults.

18

that for — the Listings do not represent the inability to

19

perform substantial gainful activity, they represent a

20

much higher cut, a cut that allows the Secretary to make

21

presumptive determinations for the people who are so

22

impaired that there is just no question that they can't

23

perform substantial gainful activity.

The remaining problem would be that the

The problem with that is

24

In fact, the Secretary, with an express delegation of

25

authority from Congress, has set the Listings at the level

1

that is used for determining disability among disabled

2

widows.

3

cannot perform any gainful activity, which, according to

4

the legislative history of that provision, is to be a much

5

more stringent test than the test used for workers both in

6

the Title II program, and in the SSI Title XVI program

7

that was modeled on that Title II program.

9

Disabled widows are found to be disabled if they

A number of courts, including the court in Willowford
v. Harris, have criticized the mechanical results that

10

sometimes occur from using a Listings-only approach for

11

widows.

12

approach for widows, Congress clearly did not say that

13

children shall be found disabled if they have an

14

impairment of comparable severity to that which would

15

render a widow disabled under the standard in the Act.

16

And those were the two standards of disability that were

17

in the Act at the time of original passage.

18

hand you had the inability to engage in substantial

19

gainful activity, which was the test for workers, and then

20

there was also the test for disabled widows, which was the

21

inability to perform any gainful activity under

22

regulations promulgated by the Secretary to so determine.

23

But whatever may be the shortcomings of that

Congress meant to help children.

most disadvantaged of young children — of all Americans.

2

And the Secretary's approach of conflating the process for

3

children and adults — I am sorry, for children and

4

disabled widows, into one test, which is seen throughout

5

his regulations and clarifying rulings, is simply

6

inconsistent with the plain meaning of the statute.

7

Mr. Kneedler made the suggestion that many of the

8

adults who qualify at step 5 do so because they have

9

adverse vocational factors:

they are approaching advanced

10

age, they are poorly educated.

11

20, fully 25 percent of all the qualifying adults,

12

according to the Secretary's figures, quality because they

medical/vocational set of problems that renders them

17

with no adverse vocational factors, a young person, well

educated, with job training, could quality as disabled

20

That is true.

However,

It is very clear from the Secretary's

That is what the City of New York case was all about,

The Secretary explains that, Counsel, by

8

saying that for an adult like that, a young adult like

9

that, the statute provides a cleat- criterion:

the ability

10

to work.

11

therefore you have to resort, the Secretary says, to

12

comparable severity, which is what the statute says, which

13

in turn forces you to look to particular functional

14

disabilities and see if the child has them.

15

It provides no such criterion for a child.

MR. WEISHAUPT:

to arrive at a conclusion that someone has a impairment

that rises to Listing level, which in and of itself is a

more .difficult test than an adult would ever be put

that he should be found to be disabled.

of disabilities, and frequently have more combinations.
However, the class of children, if you will, who suffer
from that wide array is probably not large in absolute
terms, but it is significant for those children who are
denied SSI benefits.
The SSI children's program only awards benefits to a
quarter of a million children, and approximately 100,000
claims are made each year, 50,000 of which are turned
down, and 50,000 of which are granted.

Of that 50,000

that are turned down, some number, the record does not
reflect what, of those children suffer from a combination
of impairments, like the cases cited in the amicus briefs,
that defy evaluation under the Secretary's approach.
For many children the Listings approach works
adequately.

But it is those children who don't, who need

a case by case adjudication, for which we claim that it is
important for the Secretary to have a system with the
flexibility to provide that, just as he has a system to
provide that kind of flexibility for adults.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

>

MR. KNEEDLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I do

have several things I wanted to say.

5

First of all, this class action was brought as a

6

facial challenge to the requirement that a child show that

7

his impairment meets or equals the Listing.

8

shown, that requirement was established in 1974, it was

9

ratified by Congress in 1976, and it has been in place

As we have

10

ever since.

Particular disagreements about the way the

11

Listing might be applied in a particular case, and whether

12

one child should be granted or denied under that — under

13

the Listing, are simply not properly before the Court in a

14

class action.

15

which the equivalency concept might be applied in this

16

case, or one situation or another, is not before the

17

Court.

And, for example, the particular way in

18

But with reference to the equivalency —

Why isn't — why isn't a class

QUESTION:

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

the Listings themselves was.

4

challenge the meet or equals requirement which has been in

5

the regulations for a long time.
Well, but if there are members of the

class, I gather — I don't have the definition of the

8

class in front, it would include this person in the —

9

Wilkinson case, or whatever it was that he referred to,

10

why can't the argument be made that that requirement is

11

invalid as applied to some members of the class?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, we just can't tell on this

13

record, on the basis of the record of this, of a

14

hypothetical member of a class who might have one disorder

15

or not, first of all whether he would be found disabled.

16

I mean, as I have explained, if the severity of his

17

impairment is equal in severity to one that is listed, he

18

would be found disabled.

19

QUESTION:

Well, I understand if it is equal to one

20

that is listed, but looking at page 240 of the regulation,

21

where you called our attention to paragraph 3 on 239, it

22

seems to me that there would be people who would have —

23

it would be people under 18, who would have total

24

disability but not meet one of the standards.

Because you specifically say the

2

functional consequence of the impairments (i.e., RFC)

3

irrespective of their nature or extent, cannot justify a

4

determination of equivalence.

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

And I think the parenthetical is —

7

is saying is we don't decide children's cases on the basis

8

of the residual functional capacity.

9

a child can do despite his impairment.

itself.

12

of looking at what he still has left, you look at what has

13

been taken away from him by virtue of his impairment.

You

14

match that impair — that impairment to the Listings.

And

15

in deciding whether the impairment is severe enough —

16
17

For an adult you look at the impairment

It's really two sides of the same coin.

the child's impairment has — whether his impairment has a

similar functional impact on him that the listed

impairment has on a child who has that impairment.

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, what is necessary here to

that in some instances it --

MR. KNEEDLER:

Not at all.

Is it enough to show

be the content of the regulation has to be, as we have

9

explained, manifestly contrary to the Act, that the

10

Secretary can't even proceed in this manner.

the regulation is misapplied in a particular case, that is

12

not a proper subject for a class action lawsuit such as

this.

the Court were to conclude, contrary to our interpretation

2

and contrary to Respondents' own best interests, that the

3

83-19 does not allow for consideration of functional

impact, the proper course would be — would be to

5

invalidate that ruling in a proper case.

6

don't think that's here, but —

7

QUESTION:

As we say, we

But if the regulation — Mr. Kneedler, you

8

are treating this as though the question whether a

9

regulation can be stricken on its face is the same as

10

whether a law can be stricken on its face as

11

unconstitutional, and the test there is whether in any of

12

its applications it could be constitutional.

13

test for regulation is not whether in any of its

14

applications it can be valid.

Yes.

Or it has to be, at least theoretically —

on its face it must theoretically be able to lead to the
right result in all cases, isn't that right?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

And the — theoretically it

23

can here, because the only regulatory requirement at issue

24

is whether the child can meet or equals — equal the

25

Listings.

That is theoretically possible of meeting the
