CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument first

Reina.

Mr. Trebon.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN TREBON

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

9

MR. TREBON:

Thank you.

10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:

11

The issue in this case is whether an American citizen

12

can be submitted to the criminal jurisdiction of an Indian

13

tribe even though he is not a member of the tribe simply

14

because he or she is an Indian; or, should they be treated

15

like Mr. Oliphant and other non-members with whom they are

16

similarly situated.

17

Albert Duro, the Petitioner in this case, is a

18

California Indian.

who is also from California.

2

firearm discharged and accidentally shot a 14-year-old boy

3

that was riding a bicycle approximately two blocks away,

4

undoubtedly an unfortunate incident.

5

During June of 1984, a

Mr. Duro, along with Sean Lackey, was indicated in

6

federal court for first degree murder relating to that

7

charge.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. TREBON:

10
11

It resulted in a death?
It did result in death, Justice

O'Connor, yes.
He was indicted for first degree murder, and after

12

the case was in federal court for several months, it was

13

dismissed on motion of the government and dismissed

14

without prejudice.

15

charge against Mr. Duro.

16

The government has never refiled that

Two days after the case was dismissed in federal

17

court, the federal marshals turned Mr. Duro over to the

18

Salt River Tribe.

19

with discharge of firearms, which is a misdemeanor.

20
21
22

He was charged in the Salt River Tribe

A motion to dismiss was filed by Mr. Duro in the Salt
River Tribe.

That motion was denied by Judge Manuel.

We then filed a habeas corpus petition before the

23

federal, district court.

24

remember was the district court judge involved in the

25

Wheeler decision and upheld by this Court, issued a writ

Judge Copple, who the Court may

1

of habeas corpus in favor of Mr. Duro.

2

by the Respondent to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth

3

Circuit.

4

That was appealed

The Ninth Circuit, in a 2-1 decision with Judge Sneed

5

dissenting, held that non-member Indians, unlike

6

non-Indians, are subject to the criminal jurisdiction of

7

an Indian tribe if they have significant contacts with the

8

reservation; not if the crime involves significant

9

contacts with the reservation but merely whether or not

10

the person involved has significant contacts with the

11

reservation.

12

QUESTION:

Did the Ninth Circuit adopt the context

13

rule as part of a statutory analysis?

14

to justify the context rule?

15

MR. TREBON:

How did it purport

It — it purported to justify it on the

16

basis that the tribe had an interest in someone over whom

17

they had a significant contact.

18

test, as far as I can see, has no direct relation to any

19

statute.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

The significant context

Did — did — did it purport to be some

sort of a constitutional analysis?
MR. TREBON:

No, it did not.

I think, with all due

23

respect to the Ninth Circuit, it was a rule that they

24

modeled in order to fit the problem that they determined

25

to exist on the reservation.

QUESTION:

Well, now, if you were to prevail here, I

2

take it no prosecution for the discharge of the firearm

3

would be possible in this case?

4
5

MR. TREBON:

Well, Justice O'Connor, we don't

necessarily feel that that is true.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. TREBON:

In fact —

Why not?
Well, first of all, we think that two

8

separate sovereigns could fill the supposed void that the

9

Respondents argue exist.

10

QUESTION:

The state government could —

Well, in Arizona it has not, of course,

11

come within the purview of Public Law 280.

12

have criminal jurisdiction for offenses —

13
14

MR. TREBON:

It does not

You're correct, Justice O'Connor.

That's true.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. TREBON:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. TREBON:

So that's out.
That.'s true.
All right.
But the State of Arizona continues to

19

exercise criminal jurisdiction for crimes committed on the

20

reservation between two non-Indians, and that jurisdiction

21

exists regardless of whether or not it's a 280 state.

22

The same analysis that allows them under McBratney

23

and that line of cases to have jurisdiction over non-

24

Indians would similarly allow them to have jurisdiction

25

over non-member Indians.

In fact —

QUESTION:

1

Is there any case from this Court that you

2

would point to to indicate that the State of Arizona has

3

criminal jurisdiction here?

4

given that the state did not.

5

MR. TREBON:

6

that issue as of yet.

I thought we took it as a

This Court has not directly focused upon
This is a case of first impression.

7

The cases that I would point the Court to would be

8

not only the McBratney line of cases but the cases ever

9

since Fletcher v. Peck through Brendale involving Oliphant

10

and Wheeler and the cases that follow that define tribal

11

sovereignty with respect to its own members in the state

12

interest on the reservation to all non-members, not simply

13

non-Indians.
So if you follow that line of reasoning, the

14
15

McBratney rationale could easily be extended to cover non­

16

member Indians on the reservation.
QUESTION:

17
18

But if — not a non-member Indian

attacking a member, could it?
MR. TREBON:

19

No, I would think — well, yes.

The

20

non-member Indian — no, that would be federal court.

21

sorry, Chief Justice.

22

continue to be in federal court under 1152.
QUESTION:

23

That's exactly right.

I'm

That would

So your response to me was wrong.

You do

24

not assert the State of Arizona could assert jurisdiction

25

here?

MR. TREBON:

I think the State of Arizona could

2

assert jurisdiction involving an offense on the

3

reservation —

4

QUESTION:

No, we're talking about this offense.

5

- I thought it was an — a — a member of the tribe who

6

was killed.

7

MR. TREBON:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. TREBON:

It was not.

I -

I'm sorry.

It's a non-Indian who was killed?
It's a non-member.

It is a member of an

10

adjoining tribe, an adjoining reservation.

11

Phillip Fernando Brown, who was the young child that was

12

accidentally shot in this case, nor Albert Duro,

13

member of the host tribe.

14

QUESTION:

All right.

Neither

Now, would you tell me so that

15'

I understand it, please, whether you assert that the State

16

of Arizona has criminal jurisdiction over the offense,

17

any?

18

MR. TREBON:

Let me say, Justice O'Connor,

if

I cannot

19

answer that question in the definitive manner now, but it

20

is very likely that the State of Arizona could have

21

jurisdiction under the rationale of McBratney.

22

possible that the federal government could have

23

jurisdiction as well.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well,

It is. also

dismissed the suit, and the solicitor general representing

1

the federal government says it has no jurisdiction over

2

this offense.

3

MR. TREBON:

That's true.

I think that the

4

Respondent and the government would like to create a void

5

in this case, but one doesn't actually exist —

6

7
8

9

QUESTION:

Well, I don't know about liking to.

The

concern is there may in fact be a void.
MR. TREBON:

The government said the same thing to

this Court in Oliphant.

They said there could be a hiatus

10

created if you did not grant tribal court's jurisdiction

11

over non-Indians.

12

The same type of void arguably exists in this case.

13

We believe that the void could be filled in the same

14

manner that it was filled after Oliphant.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. TREBON:

17
18

And how was that?
State courts exercise jurisdiction after

Oliphant.
QUESTION:

Is it also a possibility that no void

19

exists because we interpret the exception clause of 1152

20

to apply to tribal members?

21
22

MR. TREBON:

Precisely.

That would erase the void

completely-.

23

The other thing I guess I should point out is that —

24

QUESTION:

25

Is there — is there any precedent that

would allow us — would we have to go contrary to our

1
2

precedence to do that?
MR. TREBON:

The only case that the Court would have

3

to go contrary to arguably would be the dicta in United

4

States v. Rogers.

5

crime against a non-Indian crime.

6

before the Court that he was an Indian because he was

7

adopted into the membership of the tribe, and this Court

8

held that you may become a member but you can't become an

9

Indian simply because you're adopted by the tribe as a

10
11

Rogers is a case involving a non-Indian
The non-Indian argued

member.
Besides that, however, there is great authority for

12

doing exactly that, Justice Kennedy, for finding that the

13

Indian on Indian exception 1152 really means member on

14

member, and the basis for that is when that was first

15

included in the first permanent trade in the Intercourse

16

Act in 1834, it was introduced with three other bills, one

17

of them being the Western Territory Bill.

18

It was within the contemplation of Congress at that

19

time that the Western Territory would be created.

That

20

bill provided that there would be a confederacy of the

21

Indian tribes that would handle jurisdiction involving

22

intra-tribal offenses, when there are offenses committed

23

by one member against the — against a member of another

24

tribe.

25

in the Intercourse Acts.

So that was the understanding in the Indian trade

1

And also, treaties generally provided

— at the time

2

that the Trade Intercourse Acts were passed, treaties

3

generally provided that the government would assert inter­

4

tribal jurisdiction.

5

peace among the various tribes and, therefore, exercised

6

inter-tribal jurisdiction.

7

The United States agreed to keep

In fact, all the commentors, Prucha and Clinton and

8

Erhart and the commentors in our brief all agree that the

9

Indian — the Indian exception 1152 indeed means tribal

10

members.

11

involving one member against another member of a different

12

tribe.

13

It does not mean to vest the tribes with crimes

The other thing about the void — I think the void is

14

an interesting aspect of this case — is that even if the

15

Respondents win, there will still be a void.

16

get away from equal protection and other problems in this

17

case, they suggested to this Court that it should find

18

that a tribe has jurisdiction over enrolled Indians of any

19

federally recognized tribe.

20

In order to

That would mean who would have jurisdiction over non-

21

enrolled Indians?

The Indian on the Indian exception was

22

passed by Congress before there was ever such a thing as

23

enrolled Indians.

24

enrolled Indians till 1934 when the Indian Reorganization

25

Act was passed.

It was passed in 1834, but there was no

So that's certainly not what Congress

1
2

meant.
So the tribe now gets jurisdiction only over enrolled

3

members.

Non-enrolled Indians living on the reservation

4

will be subject to no one's jurisdiction either within the

5

analysis of the Respondent and the government.

6

And in fact, the population statistics for this

7

particular reservation show that non-enrolled Indians are

8

about as great on the reservation in number as non-member

9

enrolled Indians, so the void will be equal.

10
11
12

13

So that's

not a solution to the void problem.
In fact, it's interesting to point out in terms of a
void if this —
QUESTION:

Couldn't one say that what Indians, what

14

all Indians meant in — at the time 1152 was adopted is

15

not necessarily what all Indians means today; that in

16

light of the later legislation providing for enrollment

17

and so forth, who constitutes an Indian has simply been

18

changed?

19

That would solve that problem, wouldn't it?

MR. TREBON:

It would if the Court was willing to

20

change the definition of Indian as generally applied to

21

federal jurisdiction since Indian law began.

22

Government, we submit, does not exercise jurisdiction

23

simply over an enrolled Indian.

24
25

The Federal

There has always been a definition for Indian in
federal law involving not only whether or not someone's

enrolled but also whether or not someone's an Indian by-

race.

3

someone's more than 50 percent Indian by race, he's an

Indian for federal purposes.

5

The Indian Reorganization Act provides that if

The custom and habits of a person have also been

looked at by this Court to determine whether or not

someone is an Indian.

So we —

9

QUESTION:* So that response to Justice Scalia

10

indicates that it would be' difficult, it seems to me, to

11

interpret 1152 to avoid — to prevent the void?

12

MR. TREBON:

I think that's true, unless the Court

13

does as you suggested, Justice Kennedy, define that it

14

means tribal members.

15

legislative history —

16
17

QUESTION:

MR. TREBON:

19

QUESTION:

21

Well, but — but how can you do that

consistently with what you just told Justice Scalia?

18

20

And there's a great deal of

Well, I think the way you do it —
Because we're talking about the word

"Indian".
MR. TREBON:

The way you do it, I believe, is not to

22

find that you redefine the term "Indian", but you look at

23

the legislative history to see what Congress meant.

24
25

In this case it was passed in conjunction with the
Western Territory Bill which tends to define the meaning

applied to the terms by Congress.
Moreover, this Court in United States v. Wheeler
looked at all these statutes in —
QUESTION:

On any theory, you — you would still say

5

— when you say it means a member of the tribe, you assert

6

an enrolled member of the tribe, don't you?

7

what you mean by a member of the tribe?

8

MR. TREBON:

QUESTION:

Isn't that

Not necessarily.

Well, then

10

you're — then you're into the gap again.

11

into the gap again.

Then you're

If it includes not only enrolled members of the tribe

but unenrolled members of the tribe, then there's going to

be at least that gap, isn't there?

No.

17

MR. TREBON:

Enrolled members.
However the tribe defines its own

membership.

definitions for that.

21

We would submit that if the tribe

Different tribes, I think, have different

QUESTION:

Yes, but at the time of 1152, if you

22

assert that Indian there just means an Indian of that

23

tribe, it surely, as you just say, doesn't mean an

24

enrolled member of that tribe since there was no

25

enrollment.

1

MR. TREBON:

2

QUESTION:

3
4
5

That's correct.
It must mean an Indian who by blood

belonged to that tribe.
MR. TREBON:

And the Indian who's considered a member

by the tribe itself.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. TREBON:

All right.
That, we submit, would — would be the

8

end of tribal jurisdiction and that the state has an

9

interest in any non-member, someone who isn't affiliated

10

by the tribe, who doesn't have the privileges of

11

membership and who's not considered a member by the tribe.

12

13

QUESTION:

Equivalent to the definition of

enrollment?

14

MR. TREBON:

15

to the definition —

16
17
18

QUESTION:

I don't believe it's exactly equivalent

Well, if it isn't .exactly equivalent, then

you're going to have the void of jurisdiction.
MR. TREBON:

Well, the void, in fact, in this case,

19

if you decide that the tribe has jurisdiction over

20

enrolled Indians, it's interesting to know that 14 percent

21

of the Pimas and 16 percent of the Maricopas in this case

22

are not enrolled.

23

want jurisdiction only over enrolled members.

24

willing to give up 14 percent of our own Pimas and 16

25

percent of our own Maricopas.

So the tribe is apparently arguing we

We're

1

So there's another void created.

Pimas and Maricopas

2

won't even be covered by that definition, not all of them,

3

and that represents approximately 6 percent of the total

4

population of the reservation as well.

5

So it's kind of interesting in order to get non­

6

member Indians who are not affiliated with the tribe that

7

they're willing to give up Indians who are, simply because

8

they're not enrolled.

9

We believe that this Court essentially grappled with

10

these issues and answered them not only in Oliphant but

11

also in Wheeler.

12

same statutes, the same language, and explicitly

13

stated — Wheeler was argued two days apart from Oliphant

14

and decided 16 days later, and in that case the Court

15

explicitly stated that tribes do not have jurisdiction

16

over non-members.

17

In Wheeler, this Court construed the

And the reasoning of those cases, I think, is

18

particularly applicable here.

The Court reasoned that the

19

tribes have the right of self-government.

20

self-government not only involves the same federal

21

interest in law and order but also involves the interest-

22

in preserving orderly relations among their members and

23

the traditions and mores of a society, and that those

24

traditions and mores should be preserved through tribal

25

government, through self-government.

May I ask you this question?

If this case

6

had arisen prior to 1924 when your client was not an

7

American citizen, would you make the same argument?

8

MR. TREBON:

9

for two reasons.

I would have made the same argument but
Let first say that there's a very good

10

argument that Mr. Duro's ancestors were citizens to the

11

Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo or at least entitled to

12

citizen -- citizenship rights; therefore, he — his people

13

could have been a citizen in 1848.

14

But to answer the question directly, I .think things

15

have changed now.

If Mr. Duro would have been treated

16

differently because he was a ward rather than a citizen,

17

then the — but I think that difference relates more to

18

the Federal Government's treatment more than the treatment

19

by another tribe.

20

In fact, the treaties during that time would have

21

generally given the United States the role, if not the

22

obligation or the favor, the role of exercising

jurisdiction over those offenses.

3

MR. TREBONs

4

QUESTION:

5
6

Yes, Your Honor, we do.
What — what is that constitutional

argument?
MR. TREBON:

Well, the Indian Civil Rights Act was

7

passed and applied some of the constitutional protections

8

of the Bill of Rights to the exercise of criminal

9

jurisdiction by Indian tribes but not all.

It's important

10

to point out that it was a compromise, that it allowed

11

traditions and customs of the tribe which is unique to

12

each tribe to be applied.

13

QUESTION:

But what is the constitutional principle

14

that would be violated if the United States were to say

15

that Duro could be tried by this tribe?

16

MR. TREBON:

Number one, no right to counsel.

17

Indigents do not have a right to counsel in tribal court.

18

The penalty that can now be imposed in tribal court for

19

each count is one year.

20

No right to counsel.

Secondly and most fundamentally, I would argue, is

21

that by the tribal constitutional law, no one but a tribal

22

member can sit in a jury in tribal court; therefore, Mr.

23

Duro, his ethnological group and any other group of non­

24

members cannot sit on tribal juries in tribal court.

is that there's -- Kagama says there's two sovereigns in

was charged by the Salt River community in that offense

which resulted in the death of a 14-year-old boy who was a

not to engage in warfare with other tribes as a result of
such so-called depredations.
So there has been no express divestiture of the
jurisdiction here, and the question is whether its
retention is subject to an implied divestiture because it
would be incompatible with the status of the tribes as
dependent limited sovereigns.
The Court concluded in Oliphant that there was such
an implied ‘divestiture because of the long historical
understanding that the jurisdiction over non-Indians did
not exist and because the Federal Government by statute
had assumed jurisdiction to' prosecute those offenses.
The same considerations quite clearly, it seems to
us, lead to the opposite conclusion here.

From 1817 to

the present, the federal criminal statutes applicable to
crimes in Indian country have contained an exception for
crimes by Indians against the person or property of other
Indians.

That- exception was authoritatively interpreted

by this Court in the United States v. Rogers back in 1846.
It was the version that has been carried forward ever
since, and we have quoted the applicable language on page
12 of our brief, and the exception does not speak of
members of a tribe, it says, but of the race generally of
the family of Indians, and it intended to leave them ers
both regarded their own tribe and other tribes also to be

MR. WALLACE:

And the provision has been reenacted

General that we cite, and there has never been any

repudiation of that interpretation by Congress as it has

14

carried that provision forward.

QUESTION:

division?

MR. WALLACE:

Well, we think it is not entirely race

based even though as we say there is an ancestral element

20

included in it.

21

Much of the reason that there is commingling of

regardless of whether they're members of the home tribe.

2

Indian health services are available; employment

3

preferences are available both in the Bureau of Indian

Affairs and in tribal enterprises.

5

This has encouraged the living together of Indians

6

and the identification of Indians as tribal persons

7

subject to some unique legal relationships based on their

8

history and on the Constitution's provision in Article 1

9

that Congress can regulate commerce with the Indian

tribes.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, can I interrupt you for a

moment on the Rogers case?

13

At that time in 1846 when the Court talked about the

14

family of Indians including both members and non-members,

15

all of the members of that family shared the

16

characteristic of noncitizenship —

21

have the benefit of American citizenship as well as those

22

who do not.

1

At that time there would have been no differential

2

treatment between the litigant in this case and other

3

citizens, whereas now, in order to sustain your position,

4

you must say some citizens are treated differently than

5

other citizens.

6

*\

That was the question before this Court

7

in United States v. Antelope, and the Court unanimously

8

held that Congress justifiably could treat members of

9

Indian tribes who are citizens of the United States

10

differently from other citizens with respect to which

11

court has criminal jurisdiction over them and the

12

punishment to which they are subjected.

MR. WALLACE:

I think that is precisely what was at issue in the

14

Antelope case.

15

QUESTION:

Yes, but the rationale was that they were

— there were characteristics which differentiated them

17

from other citizens; namely, their Indian status.

that isn't true here.

MR. WALLACE:

But it is true here.

But

These are members

These are enrolled members of tribes who are

in a unique relationship with the Federal Government and

enjoy certain benefits and obligations as a result of

24

over certain offenses that they may commit.

similar to the Antelope case in that respect.

Members of their own tribe are citizens of the United
States.

And we don't believe that there is a

jurisdictional gap of any kind.
QUESTION:

Well, what about non-enrolled?

MR. WALLACE:

While that question need not be faced

in this case because we're dealing with an enrolled
member, we think that if — if a person is eligible for
enrollment as a member and has not repudiated membership
in the tribe, that that person should be treated the same
as an enrolled member for these purposes just as someone
who hasn't registered to vote.

If it's just a formality

that has kept someone off the rolls, that would not be a
repudiation of tribal identification.
QUESTION:

That's really allows a construction of the

federal statute.
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

It does, but —

And if you can construe it that way, you

might be able to construe it some other way.
MR. WALLACE:

members of the tribe itself who are resident on the
reservation, some of whom may not have bothered to get
their names onto the tribal rolls; and why they should be

Are there laws, Mr. Wallace, under which

we treat unenrolled Indians who are eligible for
enrollment but have chosen not to enroll the same as
enrolled Indians?
MR. WALLACE:

There's no decision of this Court on

the subject, but I think the logic of the Court's
decisions are assumed in the 19th Century that Indians are
all members of tribes.

Enrollment is something that came

much later.
And as I say, in this case enrollment is satisfied,
and we don't have to face up to that problem.

Either way,

we think there would not be a jurisdictional gap, but we
think that the jurisdiction of the tribal court would
extend beyond enrollment.

13

118, the Court made very clear that it was reading the

14

Major Crimes Act which was enacted because state courts

15

did not have jurisdiction and these major crimes would

16

only be subject to tribal courts, and they were worried

17

that the tribal courts would not deal adequately with

these major crimes.

not to have jurisdiction over members of other tribes.

2

Its effect is confined to the acts of an Indian of some

tribe of a criminal character committed within the limits

of the reservation.

5

That was the category of offenses that

6

correspondingly were within the jurisdiction of the tribal

courts and where Congress felt that for major crimes the

tribal court should not be relied upon but they still were

being relied upon for the minor offenses, the minor

assaults, domestic violence, disorderly conduct, the same

offenses on which we continue to rely upon the tribal
