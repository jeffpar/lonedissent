ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY T. CASO

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CASO:

12

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Rightly or wrongly individuals in our society

13

are judged, categorized and characterized by their

14

associations.

15

Today's case concerns the freedom to choose those types of

16

associations by which we will be judged.

17

It is in fact how we define ourselves.

An example from recent history is very relevant.

18

Earlier this month at its convention, the American Bar

19

Association adopted a resolution on the question of

abortion rights.

position that he felt compelled to announce his

California to regulate attorneys through a mandatory bar

it also authorize the bar to, in the words of the

4

California Supreme Court, comment generally upon matters

5

pending before the legislature.

Instead, it asks whether having done so, may

and the freedom of speech are before the Court in this

case.

Speech rights are implicated by compelled dues

purposes, while association rights are implicated by

only by a compelling state interest.

14

identifies no such interest, yet, instead, seeks a blanket

15

exemption under the so-called government speech doctrine.

16

The bar in this case

All attorneys in California are required both to

17

-- to belong and pay an annual dues payment to the State

18

Bar in order to maintain their license to practice law.

19

In addition to its many regulatory activities, the bar

20

also engages in activities we've identified as political

21

and ideological.

22

range from environmental questions to criminal penalties.

23
24
25

These include lobbying on issues that

QUESTION:

May they lobby on any subject

permissibly against the views of some minority?
MR. CASO:

compelling governmental interest.

2

there is a reason for California to force these people

3

together into an association and pay a fee for that

4

purpose.
QUESTION:

5

In other words, if

So — so your answer to my question

6

is that they can — they can lobby for nothing unless

7

there's a compelling interest for it?

8

MR. CASO:

Yes.

9

QUESTION:

Could they lobby for a pro bono

10

requirement for all attorneys in the state?
MR. CASO:

11

Again, if the state identifies that

12

as an interest for forcing all attorneys into an

13

association --

14

QUESTION:

Well, that — take this — take this

1
15

case.

Suppose that you prevail on -- on your theory,

16

could the bar association lobby the legislature for a

17

requirement that all lawyers in the State of California

18

devote 30 hours a year for pro bono work?
MR. CASO:

19

I don't believe so because I believe

20

that there's an underlying public policy purpose behind

21

such legislation that doesn't extend to a reason for

22

California to force these people into a group, to force

23

them to pay a fee to make that type of a political

24

judgment.

QUESTION:

Well, do you have to start kind of

building the wheel from scratch every -- every question

2

you get to with respect to the State Bar?

3

say there is sufficient reason to — for California to

4

require an integrated bar in the interest of attorney —

5

to start out with, in the interest of maintaining attorney

6

discipline and that sort of thing?

7

MR. CASO:

Couldn't one

Indeed, that is what this Court did

8

in Lathrop.

9

go beyond that, it's Petitioners' position that they must

10

But when the state also authorizes the bar to

identify what state interest they are fulfilling.
QUESTION:

11

Well, but couldn't you say some of

12

these things are at least offshoots of the need to

13

regulate the practice

14

of -- regulate the practice of law?

15

MR. CASO:

If indeed they are offshoots.

And

16

the way the Court's test would -- would look at that is,

17

is this actually advancing the compelling state interest

18

in the least drastic means.

19

QUESTION:

Well, do -- but do you think the

20

Lathrop decision that a state may integrate its bar is

21

based on a compelling necessity for integrating the State

22

Bar?

23

MR. CASO:

I'm not sure that the Court in

24

Lathrop used those terms.

25

the analysis in the plurality decision the court was just

looking at, given these things that the bar is doing, the

2

state is promoting an interest to improve the delivery of

3

quality legal services.

4

of political conduct that the bar in this case engages in.
QUESTION:

5
6

at all, did it?

7

a speech case?

So, it's not looking at the types

Indeed, Lathrop didn't involve speech

So you'd never get into -- what was it --

8

MR. CASO:

It was both --

9

QUESTION:

Was it —

10

MR. CASO:

-- a speech and association case, and

11

only the association issue was decided.
QUESTION:

12

13

decided.

Only the association issue was

There wasn't any compelled speech by anybody.
I thought your position was -- and your answers

14
15

didn't seem to indicate this -- but I thought your

16

position was that it can't be a compelling state interest

to -- to make the -- the organized bar lobby.

compelling state interest.

QUESTION:

And let's take the Lathrop

To make them lobby.

What -- what --

22

what would be the — the example in which it would be

23

necessary for the State Bar to lobby to compel --

25

MR. CASO:

Well, to take the Lathrop example,

improving the quality of legal services.

If the state

1

legislature holds sway on those particular issues, the bar

2

should be able to go to the legislature and lobby, for

3

instance, on an issue relating to the qualifications for a

4

law school, the qualifications one must possess before

5

they could take a bar examination.

6

QUESTION:

And then you're saying there's a

7

compelling state interest that the bar association must

8

lobby on qualifications for law schools?

9

MR. CASO:

No, Your Honor.

I'm saying there is

10

a compelling state interest -- the base compelling is what

11

I believe was recognized in Lathrop, was improving the

12

quality and delivery of legal services.

13

would then allow the bar to go and lobby on issues that

14

are related to that, that actually advance that interest.

And that base

15

QUESTION:

But the bar wouldn't have to do that?

16

MR. CASO:

It would not have to do that.

17

It

wouldn't be --

18

QUESTION:

It may authorize to —

19

MR. CASO:

It would be authorized.

20

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.

21

QUESTION:

Well, what if I disagree with that

22

position of the bar even though it's an issue that relates

23

to lawyers?

MR. CASO:

Precisely, and your rights are --

3

QUESTION:

But you say that would be okay?

4

MR. CASO:

Your rights are infringed.

It's okay

5

because the state has identified a compelling interest

6

that allows it to overcome your individual right of

7

dissent in that circumstance.

8

QUESTION:

What is that?

MR. CASO:

Again, I'm going back to Lathrop.

The interest recognized was improving the quality and

delivery of legal services.

QUESTION:

California, in this case, has
There is none in this

Now, does Abood speak in terms of a

15

justification by a compelling state interest in every

16

case, or does it talk about germaneness to the purpose?

17

MR. CASO:

Abood first talks about the

18

importance of the state's interest.

word compelling state interest.

It doesn't use the

Germaneness comes in —

QUESTION:

Do you rely on Abood?

21

MR. CASO:

Yes, Your Honor.

22

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.

23

MR. CASO:

The germaneness question in Abood

24

comes into then is what we're allowing issues to be spent

25

upon, is that germane to the state's interest?

MR. CASO:

In this case, we have the entire

15

California the right to comment generally on all matters

that come before the legislature without restriction.

They have been prohibited from

is the State Bar free to give endorsements to judicial

2

candidates on retention elections?
MR. CASO:

3

I don't believe so.

Nor are they

4

allowed to do so under legislation that was passed after

5

they had done so in this case.

6

QUESTION:

7

Okay.

So can we agree with you

without overruling Lathrop?

8

MR. CASO:

Certainly.

In fact, we would be —

9

QUESTION:

How?

10

MR. CASO:

We would be adopting Lathrop as the

base and this is what we have found to be a sufficient

12

interest for the state to force all attorneys into an

association.

legal services or improving its delivery, they must

that.

If they wish to do something beyond those

They have not done

18

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.

19

QUESTION:

But you say Lathrop was (inaudible).

20

MR. CASO:

I would argue that the interest found

21

by the Court to justify the association in Lathrop arises

22

to the level of a compelling interest, as did the dissent

23

in the California Supreme Court.

certainly a related case on the other side, uses that

MR. CASO:

2

That's true, Your Honor.

The -- the

3

phrase "compelling state interest" first appeared in a

compelled fee case in a Chicago Teacher's Union case in a

footnote in which it referenced the decision in Roberts v.

Jaycees, and the compelling state interest was used in

restricting association rights.

And, again, we have here

I mean, had there been no union, they

9

MR. CASO:

Uh-huh.

10

QUESTION:

But just living in Berkeley or Boise,

11

or wherever it is, or being a member of the bar is what

12

does it here.

13

MR. CASO:

Here it's the fact that one wants to

14

practice this particular profession, the state places a

15

burden on that.

16

QUESTION:

Right.

17

MR. CASO:

It says in order to do so you have to

18

belong to this group and you have to pay this group a fee.

19

And so we look to why can the state do that, where is the

20

state's interest?

21

If it's a regulatory interest, that's fine.

But

22

does that interest extend to allowing that group to engage

23

in the type of political activity at issue here?

24
25

And the question comes up is what type of an
entity is the bar.

It is in fact — at least, purports to

3

to deny this in a portion of its brief, but then it later

4

claims majority support for some of its positions.

5

QUESTION:

When it speaks, it purports
The bar may attempt

Well, even if Abood applies here,

6

wouldn't you say that a good many of the State Bar's

7

ideological activities and positions are germane to its

8

purpose in the -- advancing the administration of justice

9

and so forth?

10

MR. CASO:

Well, the precise definition of that

11

term is the precise problem in this case, Your Honor.

California Supreme Court defined the term administration

13

of justice to be essentially meaningless.

14

what those words mean.

said, that's the bar's purpose.

Well, I'm just asking you whether

20

that wouldn't meet the Abood test of germaneness, at least

21

as we have articulated it in that case.

22

MR. CASO:

You -- you would first have to find

23

that a grant of authority that broad to comment on

24

anything that comes before the legislature is itself a

sufficient interest of the state to compel attorneys into

QUESTION:

Although nothing in our cases, in

MR. CASO:

Abood, I believe, uses the words

"sufficiently important."

Hudson, Chicago Teacher's Union

10

uses the words "compelling state interest," as does

11

Roberts v. Jaycees.

12

QUESTION:

Your principal argument seems to be

13

that a lawyer who disagrees with the position is going to

be somehow branded in the community for having views that

he or she doesn't really espouse.

(Laughter.)

19

MR. CASO:

But as a practical
Everybody

But lawyers are very public people,

20

Your Honor, and they are going to be branded by these

21

positions simply because the only essence of the bar's

22

speech is that it claims to be that of its members.

23

In other words, let me put it in the words of

24

the California legislature --

be the members of the majority or the Board of Governors.

2

Whatever.

That's all.
MR. CASO:

3

Let -- let me take an example from

4

recent history.

A judge in California, Judge Walker, has

5

just gone through a very bruising confirmation process.

6

One of the issues was he belonged to a private club that

7

had a restrictive membership policy.

8

branded on him even though he got up and said, "I disagree

9

with that."

That policy was

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Caso, in our Abood

17

decisions dealing with, I believe, other -- other union

18

members, it seems to me the ground upon which objection

19

was made by the dissidents was not that they were tarred

with the brush approved by the majority but that their

money was being taken to express views with which they

didn't agree.

So, insofar as you're talking about

by the people similarly situated in — in Abood and

Hudson?
MR. CASO:

Correctly, Your Honor.

And again, it

has both those elements.

And the reason Abood came out

7

differently -- you remember in Abood the petitioners in

8

that case asked for an injunction against the activity and

9

the court says, no, you can't have it.

And the reason is

10

that the underlying union in Abood is itself a voluntary

organization.

13

That's what a union is.

of the California Bar has to pay for whatever activities

we conclude the bar association may engage in?

MR. CASO:

Yes, Your Honor.

If you agree with

me on the association issue, then there is going to be no

will have to be established.

One of the first questions of the Court dealt

2

with what it is that we have left in this case, and I must

3

say that I have had a great deal of difficulty trying to

4

determine what the petitioners' position is on that from

5

the beginning.

6

I should tell you, first of all, that in all the

7

formal pleadings in this case, the complaints, the attempt

8

to get a preliminary injunction against the State Bar, the

9

motion for a partial summary judgment, all asked that the

10

State Bar be prevented from doing these things, from using

11

its name in any way in any legislative activity, from ever

12

appearing before the legislature as a State Bar on any

13

issue and ever advising any member of the public of its

14

position on any legislative matter.

15

injunction they sought to obtain and that's what their

16

complaint asks.

But if you look at the last page at the top,

they say, "Instead, it is the bar's political and

5

already said that political in this context doesn't mean

much.

don't any longer add anything to what we're talking about.

What they're talking is legislative advocacy.

then, Mr. Hufstedler, that the State Bar is precisely the

2

equivalent of, say, the corporate City of Sacramento or

3

the City of San Diego, which I presume could take

4

positions on almost anything they wanted to without

violating the Constitution?

I quite agree, Your Honor.

We

jurisprudence, period.

may lobby and so forth to the same extent that the city or

you think that the Constitution might raise any problems

you today -- if the Board of Governors said, we want to go

out and support any position with respect to abortion, I

4

don't think that per se is included within the

5

administration of justice.
Or let's take a more concrete example because

6

7

this one is in the record, it's the one area where the

8

complaint is made that the State Bar has done something it

9

shouldn't do, and it's an area I would say to you that

10

probably is not within the administration of justice.

11

we can start with those propositions.

So,

The Conference of Delegates in California

12

13

adopted a resolution favoring nuclear freeze.

Now, in my

14

view, that's not an area of the administration of justice.

15

It might involve some kind of a statute, but I think under

16

the statutes of California the State Bar is not authorized

17

to lobby on that proposition.

QUESTION:

Well, does a nuclear freeze or the

abortion controversy -- does that raise a constitutional

problem?

confine the bar to the administration of justice, so the

bar may lobby on matters in the public interest.

2

Not only the advancement of the administration of justice

is a legitimate goal, not only is it an important goal --

qualifies?

It seems to me the answer is yes.
Now, the second constitutional question, as I

understand it, that this Court has laid down is, all

right, if the legislature has adopted that goal, have they

adopted reasonable means in order to pursue it?

indeed, there was some discussion and there was some

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Hufstedler, what if in the

same general area there were a referendum in California to

4

abolish capital punishment as it is provided in whatever

5

section it is of the California criminal code.

6

the bar constitutionally and statutorily take a position

7

on that?
MR. HUFSTEDLER:

My view would be no, that —

I can't imagine anything that's more

germane to the administration of justice.
MR. HUFSTEDLER:

12

Well, certainly for somebody

13

who is charged with it, I think that's quite right.

14

let me — let me — let me sort these out just a bit,

15

because I think the armor-piercing bullet case is an

16

example.

17

But

Each of these things have various kinds of

18

elements that do go directly to the administration of

19

justice and they have various underlying policy elements.

20

Now, if the question put before the State Bar was should

21

there be capital punishment or should there not be capital

22

punishment, I suggest to you that's not a matter of

23

administration of justice.

24

matter and, therefore, the State Bar should stay out of

25

that, as indeed they have.

That's an underlying policy

Suppose they did that.

Now, if they did that, I would have no doubt of

12

its constitutionality because, one, the state has a

13

perfectly legitimate interest in determining what the

14

views are of people who have knowledge in that area, and

15

this is a rational way of having that information

16

collected and made available -- it need not be exclusive.

It certainly is.

2

And the answer to that -- my answer to that would be yes,

3

Justice Stevens, and let me tell you why.

4

you come back to what is really the very important

5

question here and the crux.

And each time

These people are required to pay dues to the

6
7

State Bar, and if they are required to pay dues, shouldn't

8

we act as though this were a private organization and they

9

have — because their dues are being used some way they

10

don't want to they ought to have some kind of relief.

11

answer to that question is no for two reasons, both of

12

which it seems to me give you a complete answer here.

14

The

The first is that this is a state agency, and

it's a legitimate, genuine state agency.
QUESTION:

15

I can —

Well, let's talk about that for a

16

minute.

17

that because it's a state agency the First Amendment is

inapplicable.

I don't defend that position.

I think what

the court said is this is a state agency.

Clearly the

That's what it and the Fourteenth

But the point is that when the state imposes a

6

tax — let me use the word tax for the moment — upon each

7

lawyer for the right to practice law in California, it now

8

has a tax which it can use for any legitimate, authorized

9

purpose.

And if that purpose is a constitutional purpose,

10

we don't then have the negative First Amendment rights

11

applicable to the activity of a government agency.

Now, that's the first ground and that's why the

So, there are some disadvantages.

4

I'm sure, what Harlan said in Lathrop.

He thought it was

beyond any doubt that the government could charge lawyers

6

a fee for practicing law and he thought there was no

7

question they could use those fees to set up a law

8

revision commission or some such institution to comment on

9

the change of laws.
And that's essentially the argument, that this

is a tax; you can't demit from the payment of the tax even

that that was a legitimate public issue and would pass

QUESTION:

Yet the governor of California may go

from place to place in the state and take positions on

just one side of issues and certainly no one can challenge

the fact that the state may be paying for his trips.

10

MR. HUFSTEDLER:

Absolutely certain that elected

11

officials can do so and can endorse any issue they wish to

12

do so, and that's paid for by taxes and you can't demit,

13

you can't refuse to pay taxes or get part of it back

Well, I would suppose it would

have to have a fairly close relationship to lawyers.

can impose a tax upon lawyers for the right to practice

if you look at the amount of money the State Bar spends

10

for these few items of lobbying that the complaint is made

because seven-eights of the budget, as the record shows,

MR. CASO:

1

Yes, Your Honor.

Let me explain.

2

1982, when this case began, the bar was identifying

3

approximately 16 to 17 percent of its budget as

administration of justice functions.

In

Since that time, however, there's been a

tremendous increase in dues that's devoted exclusively to

discipline.

9

began, the dues were approximately $200.

And I haven't attempted to calculate what

We were talking

10

about 16 to 17 percent of its budget as the total amount

11

devoted to this type of activity.

Correct.

QUESTION:

I mean to lobby for —

Again,

23

we have to start from the state ground, is that the state

has to identify why is it doing this.

MR. CASO:

The remedy this Court should issue is

activities related to the delivery of quality legal

MR. CASO:

Certainly I don't think you can

I'm not saying delegating.

I'm

saying whenever you have a voluntary association of

lawyers that has come forward and said these are our

are, you prima facia don't need a mandatory state

association of lawyers to do the same thing.

20

MR. CASO:

Well, certainly, and there are a

21

number of those associations, and the legislature is

22

better served because only those people that want to

legislature is better able to evaluate it in that respect.

For what?
MR. CASO:

Well, this Court has recognized

that's okay for the state to do, for discipline matters,

for continuing legal education, for ethics requirements.

These are things that the state can compel attorneys into
