ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE D. LIVINGSTON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LIVINGSTON:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
This case involves the statutory interpretation

11
12

of 18 U.S.C. 924(e), which provides for a mandatory

13

minimum term of imprisonment of 15 years without parole to

14

persons found in violation of Section 922(g) of that Title

15

and who have three previous convictions for a violent

16

felony.

17

A violent felony under that statute is defined

18

as a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding

19

one year and for purposes of this case is burglary, arson,

20

or extortion, involves use of explosives or otherwise

21

presents a risk of serious — serious potential risk of

22

physical injury to another.

23

In the district court, for purposes of facts of

24

this case, the court relied upon four felony convictions,

25

two of which we do not contest, but two of which were

1

burglary second-degree under Missouri law, which we

2

contend were not within the definition of violent felony

3

under this statute.

4

The Eighth Circuit affirmed that holding and

5

affirmed a 15-year sentence, holding that anything labeled

6

burglary under any state law fell within the definition of

7

violent felony.

8
9

The sole issue, as far as we can ascertain, is
whether the definition should give effect to the statutory

10

language and limited definition to burglaries which

11

present a serious potential risk of physical injury or

12

whether a definition which was repealed from the

13

predecessor statute, the 1984 act, should be given effect

14

as the government argues.

15

As applied to Petitioner, if those second-degree

16

burglaries are found to present a risk of injury, then he

17

would have been properly sentenced.

18

be given a new sentence, reversed and remanded so that he

19

would be given a maximum term of five years.

20

Otherwise, he should

In the abstract, the term "burglary" in the

21

statute is ambiguous.

22

definitions for that term starting, first, I think, with

23

the common law definition which is the breaking and

24

entering of a dwelling place in the night time.

25

There are a large number of

There are numerous other definitions, though.

1

Only about five — as many as -- forms of common law

2

burglary, maybe six or seven states have that definition.

3

And there are many, many varying definitions of burglary

4

among the other states.

5

QUESTION:

I — I take it that something might

6

not qualify as burglary under Roman numeral ii, but might

7

qualify as presenting a serious potential risk of physical

8

injury to another?

9

MR. LIVINGSTON:

I believe that's correct.

10

Insofar as there may be a vagueness problem with the term

11

burglary, it is possible, I believe, to find some crimes

12

which could be labeled something other than burglary, or

13

maybe be burglary and, if you ruled out the definition

14

entirely, you could still get it under a catch-all

15

definition as conduct that presents a risk of physical

16

injury to others.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

You haven't challenged the statute as

being vague, have you?
MR. LIVINGSTON:

No.

I -- I think this statute

20

can be construed without any constitutional problems.

21

didn't raise the issue below.

22

as burglary without being defined when it has a number of

23

definitions so that it is difficult to ascertain an

24

ordinary --

conduct that any fool would know is burglary, wouldn't

MR. LIVINGSTON:

Well, not — it depends whether

any fool was in Maryland, Virginia or Missouri.

Well, I know, I know.

But isn't

there some — isn't there some core meaning to burglary

MR. LIVINGSTON:

is.

No.

I — I don't believe there

At least not — insofar as the government seeks to

10

have you take their definition as one which would be any

11

concept of burglary, because that definition really is a

12

distillation or conglomeration of the broadest thing.

13

you take statutes —
QUESTION:

If

Well, I'm not — I'm not suggesting

you take — take right now — take the government's.

just wondering if — I'm just going into the possible

17

argument about vagueness, which you have given up anyway,

18

I take it.

19

MR. LIVINGSTON:

That's right.

I'm

I don't propose

20

that this case turn on vagueness.

The — the question is

21

what definition of burglary is appropriate in the statute

22

and there's a long history of case law in this Court which

23

would allow you, when you are not presented with a clear

24

definition of what burglary -- should be taken as the

25

proper definition that Congress intended, you can take the

1

common law definition.
However, I think there are other definitions.

2

3

The government-suggested definition, which includes really

4

all state burglaries, it is drafted so broadly that it

5

appears to me somebody in legislative staff or the Justice

6

Department back in 1984 said, how can we come up with a

7

definition that includes them all even though they are

8

very different from state to state.

QUESTION:

Of breaking and entering in a

dwelling place at night with intent to commit a felony?

15

MR. LIVINGSTON:

16

QUESTION:

That's right.

So --

And you say the second-degree

17

burglary in Missouri would — would not meet that

18

definition?

19

MR. LIVINGSTON:

Because there is no requirement

20

under that statute that the breaking and entering had

21

occurred in dwelling house or at night.

Or that it be — does second-degree

burglary in Missouri require the entry be unlawful?

It depends on whether you are

repealed Federal statute, or the present-day statute.

2

They have changed the definition since the time Petitioner

3

was convicted in 1963 and 1971.

4

The statute he was convicted under was a

5

breaking and entering statute.

6

is framed as entering or remaining unlawfully.

would appear to include shoplifting, which would be entry

in a building with intent to commit a crime.

required breaking and entering?

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Excuse me, it was entering or — and

14

it's the government's proposed definition, too, isn't it?

Entering or remaining surreptitiously?

MR. LIVINGSTON:

QUESTION:

Surreptitiously.

Does the surreptitiously go only with

the remaining or does it go with the entering, too?

I don't believe that the

QUESTION:

2

But I thought the government's

3

definition picked up on the definition that was left out

4

in those two- or three-year periods, and that requires a

5

building, doesn't it?
MR. LIVINGSTON:

6

That's right, which would again

7

— I don't know why it hasn't been raised by other people

8

before, but it seems to me that, again, highlights the

9

problem of a potential fact case-bound inquiry that that

10

test requires, because many of these statutes do not

11

require a building.

MR. LIVINGSTON:

14

Auto burglary is a problem.

as burglary.

that's just another example.

The government tries to say

that their test is an easy test for this apply -- Court to

apply.

21

should supply the definition for them today, but they are

22

also saying this is an easy test that this Court should

take as a matter of policy, when, in fact, there are many

burglary statutes which will not be easily applied because

would not look to the particular offense that he committed

11

to see if in fact he was in a building, but we would look

to see whether the element of the crime — the elements of

the crime of which he was convicted under state law — one

of the elements was being in a building.

MR. LIVINGSTON:

That's my test.

So I would

have no problems with that.
QUESTION:

So under your — your own test, we're

not confronting a problem of — of uncertainty here if we

— I mean there may be other problems with the

government's position, but it's not — it's not the

9

difficulty of doing case-by-case analysis.

10

MR. LIVINGSTON:

Well, it is if you limit

11

yourself to buildings.

12

-- the way I read the government's test, which seems to

13

vary in their brief, but in at least one place the

14

government's test says building -- I believe that's in the

15

repealed 1984 definition.

16

All I was saying is the government

And because that test includes the word

17

building, there are any number of state burglary statutes

18

all across this great land which do not require entry into

19

building in order to fall into that statute and be a

20

conviction.

21

So, okay.

If you — if you are taking my test

22

and not the government's test and just adding in the word

23

burglary into my test, which I didn't put into the brief,

24

then that's fine and I would agree and they would be

25

entitled to not consider my convictions as burglary.

MR. LIVINGSTON:

QUESTION:

Yes, it does.

Well, what — what is the

justification for that?

5

disjunctive.

They're phrased in the

MR. LIVINGSTON:

6

I believe —

Well, this Court, first of all,

7

does not always rely on something like "or."

For example,

8

the mail fraud case not too long ago — I think it was

9

McNally — you had an "or" and you related -- the

10

requirement that there be property or money taken in the

11

mail fraud cases you related to artifice or scheme to

12

defraud.

So that alone I do not think is dispositive.

13

More important, the plain language of the

14

statute says "otherwise."

15

inference that although Congress didn't define what

16

burglary, we sure do know that whatever burglary they were

17

talking about, it had a potential risk of physical injury

18

to others.

QUESTION:

"Otherwise" clearly makes an

construing the statute.
MR. LIVINGSTON:

That's right.

And — and the

3

legislative history, I think, thoroughly supports it.

4

know not everybody thinks the legislative history is

5

important, but the comments we have from the people in the

6

House, who were voting on this and fighting not to include

7

any property crimes at all because we just want to get bad

8

people and are burglaries really that bad — that was the

9

gist of the debate in the House.

10

I

And they finally got convinced by the people in

11

the Justice Department and the Senate that, well, perhaps,

12

some of these burglaries should stay and be enhancing

13

offenses, and so let's get the violent ones.

14

that's really what happened in this case, although the

there was no committee report.

it is within this Court's prerogative, certainly, to

construe it that way and examine the underlying conduct in

still going to have to decide, not case by case but

10

certainly element by element, which particular things in

physical injury to another.

13

For example, does nighttime do it for those

night?

test, we could very well end up right where the

element the government would — would include in its test,

21

is indeed the sort of element that creates a serious

22

potential risk of physical injury to another.

QUESTION:

9
10

Why don't you urge the common law

definition of burglary?
MR. LIVINGSTON:

11

Well, I — I think because a

12

common law definition of burglary could still involve

13

places where there is nobody home and there is no risk of

14

injury.
QUESTION:

15

Well, but I -- I think that the

16

common law theory of burglary was that if you broke into a

dwelling at the -- nighttime, the people could come home

18

while you were there even if they weren't there when you

19

came.

20

which materialized.

21

That there was a risk.

MR. LIVINGSTON:

It didn't have to be a risk

Well, I think that the risk of

22

a response or someone returning alone is not enough to

23

find the serious potential risk of injury to another.

24

-- if you decide that a — somebody could return is

enough, then you really by implication, I think, have to

So there is somebody

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Livingston, in your view I

I assume that because Congress

included those three words that they should have at least

their common ordinary meaning so far as we can determine

11

them, and they wouldn't necessarily include, I think, the

elements as you've described them.

is a — a fair way to go when you consider the language at

amalgamated the two in — in the way that we see here,

arson and extortion regardless of the risk of physical

1

I would just have to

respectively disagree with respect to that because of the

"otherwise" clause and the fact that it really states

4

serious potential physical risk of injury to others.
QUESTION:

5

Mr. Livingston, the "otherwise"

clause doesn't necessarily mean — doesn't refer

7

necessarily back to burglary arson or extortion.

8

only refer back to the immediately preceding phrase which

9

is "involves use of explosives."

It may

And, indeed, one is lead to believe that that's

what it refers back to since it also uses the word

12

"involves."

extortion, involves use of explosives or otherwise

14

involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of

15

injury.

16

So the thing reads, is burglary, arson or

It seems to me that all the "otherwise" is

attached to is the use of explosives, not the -- not the

three crimes that are specifically named.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

Very well, Mr. Livingston.

MR. LAZERWITZ:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The Armed Career Criminal Amendments Act of 1986

10

defines the term "violent felony," which may trigger a

11

mandatory minimum sentence, to include any felony that is

12

"burglary, arson or extortion, involves the use of

13

explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a

14

serious potential risk of injury to another."

15

however, did not further define the term burglary, as it

16

did in the predecessor 1984 statute.

17

Congress,

The narrow question presented here is whether

18

Petitioner's Missouri burglary convictions are violent

19

felonies under the 1986 act.

20

question, the Court must first decide what Congress meant

21

by the term "burglary" and then square that definition

22

with the precise language in Subsection 2 of Section

23

924(e)(2)(B).

of statutory construction and ultimately the question

2

presented in this case.
In our view, the pertinent language of Section

3
4

924(e),

5

and the available evidence, show that Congress intended to

retain in the 1986 version of the statute, the broad

contemporary definition that was explicitly contained in

the 1984 act.

"accepted principles of statutory construction,"

QUESTION:

(Inaudible).

(Laughter.)
MR. LAZERWITZ:

I will explain.

And Petitioner

essentially concedes the point in his proposed definition.
The first thing we have to do — first of all,
we could make believe that there were no '84 definition.
We have a statute now.

Congress uses the term burglary.

Well, what does that term mean?

This Court has long held

that when a term has an ordinary contemporary meaning and
Congress doesn't otherwise define it the Court will
presume that Congress intends that meaning.
Today, and in 1986, the term burglary does have
a core, shared meaning in this country and that is the
unlawfully entering or remaining in someone else's
building with the intent to commit a state or Federal
offense.
QUESTION:

That — that was the '84 definition?

MR. LAZERWITZ:

Yes.

And just to clarify one

point —
QUESTION:

Well — well wait a minute Mr. — you

-- you say it does have commonly accepted meaning.

I

mean, is that meaning commonly accepted other than having
been adopted by Congress in 1984?
MR. LAZERWITZ:

That is the core definition of

burglary that is in place in 41 states today and, agreed,

1

there are many states that have a broader definition.

2

this is what, in terms of the common denominator, so to

3

speak, of what burglary is today.

4

But

There's no doubt that some states, many states,

5

will punish as burglary, breaking into a car, breaking

6

into a vending machine.

7

QUESTION:

8

And I take it nine would not punish

some of those things as burglaries but —

9

MR. LAZERWITZ:

Well, there are — there are —

10

as we counted and -- there are five states that have

11

retained the common law definition of burglary.

12

And just to take care of that point now, one of

13

the reasons why this Court shouldn't adopt the common law

14

definition is it would effectively write the burglary

15

predicate offense out of the statute.

And we certainly

A
16

know that Congress didn't want that because the whole

17

point of the act, at least in '84, was to get burglars in

18

Federal prisons if they commit enough crimes.

statute that says it is burglary if it's done at night or

in a building, you would not be able to use that for

purposes of this statute because it was not necessary in

Now, why isn't that a very sensible way of

It's not a sensible way because,

And that is a telling point, because if

Congress where repealing entirely its treatment of

13

wouldn't have done so because, if in fact Petitioner is

right — the words "burglary, arson, extortion" are

items in my remaining minutes.
First, I note — Note 8 of the government's

use of the common law burglary or other statutes different

20

than their interpretation for the term "burglary."

21

Second, I think this is a plain language case.

22

More than anything, although the legislative history

23

supports us, in a response to Justice Scalia's question

24

about the comma or about "or otherwise" modifying

"involves use of explosives" and before "or otherwise"

precludes that interpretation and it's just as likely that

it could be interrupted to modify the entire portion of

the statute.
QUESTION:

May I ask y€PCT one question that's

very important to me?

That — in your view of elements

7

supposing your client had been charged with a crime,

whatever the definition we end up with, that fit the

definition but the statute in the state involved permitted

10

conviction for a broader category.

the charging papers or you look at the statute?

12

MR. LIVINGSTON:

QUESTION:

Do you say you look at

I say you look at the statute.

So you would say in all those cases

14

that it doesn't count, even though they can prove without

15

any question that the elements of the offense were present

16

in the particular case, if the statute didn't require them

17

to be in every case?

If the statute didn't require

them to be in every case, then, under my interpretation,

it would not be an enhancing offense.

QUESTION:

MR. LIVINGSTON:

That's right.

I just want to be sure.
I also would like to address

5

Justice White's question about expanding the act.

I think

6

it is important, and we made the point in our reply brief,

7

and I think the legislative history definitely supports us

8

in this regard, that although the change from 1984 to 1986

9

expanded the act — which it undeniably did; it added all

10

of the various crimes — it used to just be robbery and

11

burglary and they expanded it to get murder, rape, mayhem,

12

whatever else.

13

But there was a great deal of debate about

14

excluding property crimes and, specifically, burglary.

QUESTION:

Are arson and extortion defined in

up later?

15

MR. LIVINGSTON:

They also are not defined.

We

16

have stated in our brief that extortion, particularly is

17

problematic.

18

you're defining what's a risk of injury, maybe arson seems

It is not an issue here to day
