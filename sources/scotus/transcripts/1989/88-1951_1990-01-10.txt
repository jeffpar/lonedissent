ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINE DESAN-HUSSON

10

PRO HAC VICE, ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. DESAN-HUSSON:

11

12

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether equitable

13
14

recoupment can confer jurisdiction on a district court to

15

hear a taxpayer's suit against the United States for a tax

16

refund when that suit is otherwise barred as untimely.

17

The short answer is no.

Equitable recoupment is

18

a defensive doctrine.

19

claim, a currently owed claim or debt.

20

litigation about the amount of that claim, litigation over

21

which a court already has jurisdiction.

22

Its logic operates to reduce a
It operates in

Equitable recoupment must operate in this way

23

because an equitable doctrine cannot expand the

24

jurisdiction of a district court beyond its statutory

25

limits.

Here, Sections 7422 and 6511 of the Internal

1
2

Revenue Code make it clear that no suit for a tax refund

3

may be maintained against the United States unless a

4

refund claim for that tax has been timely filed.

5

refund claim for the gift tax at issue here was untimely,

6

and nothing in the doctrine of equitable recoupment

7

changes that.
The dispute — this dispute began because of the

The

tax treatment of a lump sum payment received by the

10

respondent in 1976.

11

administrator of her former employer's estate.

12

13

employer and the beneficiary of his estate.

14

At that time, she was serving as the

15

return was filed and the respondent paid a gift tax of

16

approximately $20,000.

17

$133,000.

19

Do you know why there was no gift tax

return filed that year?
MS. DESAN-HUSSON:

20
21

No return or gift tax was paid on that.
QUESTION:

gift, should the government give credit for the gift tax

2

that was paid?
MS. DESAN-HUSSON:

3

The government will give

4

credit.

In fact, what happened in this case is that in

5

1983 the Internal Revenue Service determined that the

6

amount was income and asserted the deficiency.

7

The Internal Revenue Service can't in the notice

8

of deficiency just lop off a certain amount because the

9

amount of the deficiency is statutorily defined.

10

amount goes off in credits or recoupment can't be

11

performed.

So, that

12

The Service could -- does have the authority to

13

settle a claim, at which point it may make — it may take

14

into account the fact that a gift tax was paid.

And there was some settlement here?

There was a settlement in

Did that give credit in the

It's unclear whether -- the

21

court of appeals decided that it was necessary to remand

22

It's clear that --

QUESTION:

Right.

MS. DESAN-HUSSON:

And at that point the IRS

10

will give credit, will — it's given notice to taxpayers

11

in its Revenue Ruling 7156 that it will at that point

12

perform equitable recoupment.

QUESTION:

14

MS. DESAN-HUSSON:

That

^

1

would just have been a claim for a refund of gift tax, and

2

that was outside of its authority.
The point is only that — that the taxpayer had

3
4

to litigate the income tax deficiency and seek to reduce

5

the amount of the income tax deficiency because the gift

6

tax claim was untimely in 1985, which is when this claim

-- this claim began.

May I just interrupt, if I may?

I think it was, wasn't it, that they filed the —

She could have --

Right.

-- she had paid her income tax and

filed a refund suit which had two counts in it.

says I want the money back for the erroneously collected

18

Would the gift tax claim have been timely?

19

MS. DESAN-HUSSON:

I — I believe what would

20

have happened is that the Service would have considered —

21

the way you stated it, would have considered under number

22

one that what in fact had happened was that the taxpayer

23

was filing a refund claim for the income tax.

24

would then have used the gift tax, the payment of the gift

25

tax, as an equitable reason why the income tax could be

So she would have gotten credit.
QUESTION:

It might have given her credit if --

but would it have had the authority under your argument

4

you make here to strike count 2 of her complaint and say

5

it's too late to sue for the gift tax?

6

MS. DESAN-HUSSON:

Yes.

I believe if count 2

constituted a gift tax refund claim, it wouldn't have had

the authority to do otherwise.

QUESTION:

It wouldn't have had the
When —

Assume for a moment that the income

12

so we have — and she files the two counts.

13

you could strike count one for 30 but would they then —

14

could they then have defended the 100,000 on the ground —

15

the $100,000 claim on the ground that there's — it's too

16

late to get the 30 back?

MS. DESAN-HUSSON:
would have done that.
QUESTION:

And you say

I don't think that the IRS

2

distinction on which jurisdiction rests.

3

It's a

Specifically, the Tucker Act gives the district

4

courts jurisdiction over a tax refund suit.

5

jurisdiction is expressly limited by provisions of the

6

Internal Revenue Code.

7

However, that

Section 7422(a) provides that no suit or

8

proceeding shall be maintained in any court for a tax

9

refund unless an administrative claim has been duly filed

10
11

according to relevant law.
Now, Section 6511(a) of the Code in turn

12

specifies that an administrative claim for a refund must

13

be filed within three years of the time the return is

14

filed or within two years of the time a return is paid.

Yes, but it seems to me if you read

those as you -- literally, that would bar her refund claim

an income tax refund claim.

MS. DESAN-HUSSON:

Under — the Court explained

2

in Bull that it considered her a defendant.

3

the Court put it in Bull, a collection — there could be a

4

hypothetical collection action by the government in which

5

equitable recoupment was raised as a defense.

6

That is, as

But under current revenue procedures the

7

government goes ahead and summarily collects tax, and the

8

refund suit for that tax is functionally a defense.

9

the taxpayer's opportunity to litigate the amount of the

10

It's

income tax deficiency due.

11

So that in that refund action, in an action here

12

for the income tax deficiency, the taxpayer could raise an

13

equitable recoupment claim and it would be functioning

14

according to this Court's reasoning in Bull as a defense.

15

It would be an equitable reason why the income tax should

16

be reduced.

17

Now, I would note that —

18

QUESTION:

Could a claim like that ever be not

19

just kind of a recoupment or — but lead to an affirmative

20

recovery against the government on the basis --

21

23

MS. DESAN-HUSSON:

No.

No.

Recoupment is

always limited by the amount of the affirmative claim.
QUESTION:

Well, it — it is an affirmative

recovery against the government in the sense that you're

25

talking about a suit for a refund.

MS. DESAN-HUSSON:

In the sense that the

government -QUESTION:

She's paid the tax and she is — she

4

can sue to get back the amount of the gift tax, although

5

it would not be described as a refund of the gift tax, it

would be described as a recoupment and, therefore, a

7

reduction of her income tax.

11

MS. DESAN-HUSSON:

That's right.

I mean, the

government would have to write her a check because it
already had her money.
QUESTION:

I was —

And perhaps -- perhaps you think that

12

you have been through this with Justice Stevens, but I

13

want to make sure I understand it.

14

Your position is that if she had filed a suit

15

for a refund -- I know she didn't, but suppose she had

16

paid the income tax, filed the suit for a refund, would

17

she have had a right -- a right -- to recoup the gift tax

1

$100,000 and the gift tax $200,000, could she possibly
have recovered more than $100,000 from the government?
MS. DESAN-HUSSON:

3

No.

I mean, in any

4

other way the gift tax — the claim for the gift tax as an

5

independent -- as a counterclaim in that kind of

6

situation, is barred.

7

this taxpayer is not in any different posture than any

other taxpayer for whom the statute of limitations has

barred.

No.

And in this -- in that situation

And she's simply lost a meritorious claim.
QUESTION:

Well, in that situation the

government wouldn't have -- wouldn't have sought to

anyway.

But that's not before the

14

QUESTION:

Yeah.

15

MS. DESAN-HUSSON:

I see.
To play this out a little

16

farther, just to make sure that the theory -- I'm getting

17

across the theory, once the respondent petitioned the tax

18

court, she was in a forum that this court has considered

19

to be without equitable powers to apply equitable

20

recoupment.

21

In theory she could have raised her equitable

22

recoupment claim there because she at least would have

5

that tax -- that by going to the tax court that Frances

Dalm gave up her substantive right of equitable

8

recoupment.

9

The area of

The areas of agreement are that by virtue of a

10

1926 law, which was a statute enacted before this Court

11

determined the Bull case, that the tax court decisions

12

become final as to the taxes brought before it.
We agree with that proposition.

13

We further

14

agree with the government's proposition that the tax court

15

lacked jurisdiction over the doctrine of equitable

16

recoupment.

17

Now, with that it seems to me the issue comes

18

right into focus.

And the issue is may a taxpayer be

denied a hearing of a substantive right by going to the

20

tax court which had no jurisdiction to hear it on the

21

merits.

MR. PIERCE:

2

Your Honor, I would refer to Judge

3

Hand in the Elbert case, that I believe was way before his

time, where he said one does not lose a remedy by going to

5

a forum where the remedy in fact did not exist.

6

And that is precisely this situation.

Frances

7

Dalm did not lose her remedy by going to the tax court

8

when that remedy did not exist in that court.
I would — I think that case and Judge Hand's

9
10

decision in that concurring opinion becomes very relevant

11

because if you could take the Dalm situation from the

12

present and lift it up and put it back into the Elbert

13

situation, Judge Hand held that the district court had

14

jurisdiction.

15

The majority court did not hold in that case

16

that there was no jurisdiction of the district court

17

because of an untimely claim.

18

held merely that the taxpayer by going to the tax court

19

could not then later contest the income tax, which we

20

agree.

21

The majority in that court

The majority opinion there merely held that

22

there was no jurisdiction because there was no allegation

This Court did not hold that.

In the Bull case you had a situation where the
taxpayer had been subjected to an estate tax.

The revenue

10

11

it to an additional estate tax and then the petitioner

taxpayer argued that because the government had done that

inconsistent positions and assert an income tax that was

inconsistent.
