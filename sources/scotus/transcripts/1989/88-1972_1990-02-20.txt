ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARCIA L. FRIEDL

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MS. FRIEDL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case comes from the Illinois Appellate

12

Court which upheld the suppression of Defendant's murder

13

confession on the Miranda grounds.

14

The ruling precludes the use of undercover

15

agents to in any way question incarcerated suspects

16

concerning criminal offenses that they may have committed

17

and it ironically arises on facts which affirmatively

18

establish that Defendant Perkins in this case perceived no

19

pressures whatsoever to speak when making his

20

incriminating statements, but, rather, he was simply

21

killing time with boastful admissions to those whom he

22

believed to be co-conspirators in a jail break.

23

After detailing how the privilege against self­

24

incrimination is seriously threatened whenever a suspect

25

is subjected to the inherently compelling pressures of

custodial interrogation, this Court in Miranda developed

2

prophylactic warnings and rules to provide practical

3

reinforcement for the Fifth Amendment privilege.
However, because the Miranda safeguards of a

4
5

protective Fifth Amendment, and because they markedly

6

decrease the number of wholly-reliable statements that are

7

available to law enforcement for both investigation and

8

prosecution purposes, this Court has characterized those

9

safeguards as extraordinary and has consistently refused

10

to apply them outside the context of the inherently

11

compelling custodial interrogations for which they were

12

designed.

13

The Miranda's principal concern was that

14

mutually reinforcing manifestations of police dominance

15

arising from custodial interrogation will inevitably exert

16

significant pressures on an accused to speak.

17

This concern is entirely inapposite to

18

undercover elicitation statements.

19

immediate and non-transit control of a non-governmental

20

authority who also at the same makes its interest at

21

eliciting a statement apparent, might naturally believe

22

that he has no right to speak because the -- the

23

authorities' power to eventually get what it wants is

24

immediately suggested by its power of restraint.

And this man was sworn to uphold the

Constitution of the United States?

3

MS. FRIEDL:

QUESTION:

5

MS. FRIEDL:

Yes.
And violated it?
Your Honor, we — it's not our

6

position that the Fifth — either the Fifth Amendment or

7

due process clause could have conceivably been violated,

8

and certainly even — even Miranda, of course, has not

9

been violated here because the suspect, Defendant Perkins,

10

in no way could perceive the governmental dominance, the

11

— in his speaking with Agent Parisi and Informant

12

Charlton.
There was no -- there's no purpose for -- reason

13
14

to apply Miranda in this context and most certainly the

15

Constitution of the United States has not been violated

16

vis-a-vis either the Fifth Amendment or the due process

clause.

20

QUESTION:

Well, do you think that trickery can

ever amount to coercion?
MS. FRIEDL:

There could be situations where

21

trickery amounts to coercion.

My point is that in your

22

normal everyday undercover situation the deception itself

23

is going to actually take away the coercion that -- that

the police domination type coercion that Miranda was

concerned with.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

7

As my colleague has pointed out, the police

8

practice at issue in this case is categorically different

9

from the one that the Court addressed in Miranda.

10

Miranda addressed and was primarily concerned

11

with the classic police stationhouse interrogation.

And

12

the later cases have also been concerned with the

13

functional equivalent of that — interrogation in the

14

squad car or at the scene of the crime after a person has

15

been arrested and handcuffed.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. LARKIN:

How about Mathis?
Mathis involved the situation in

18

which the person was in custody and questioned by a known

19

government agent.

20

here.

21

It's the latter fact that is absent

Now, we've also taken the view in Point A in our

22

brief that the mere fact that someone is in jail does not

23

automatically mean he must be given Miranda warnings

24

because the context in which there is some type of

25

questioning should also be considered.

the factual situation we have and what you had in Mathis

7

As my colleague has

In fact, the fact that Respondent was in jail
was really significant in this case for only two reasons.
One, it allowed the police to find him.

After

8

all, the police tried to put Charlton and Respondent

9

together outside of jail, at a motel, in order to find out

10

if Respondent was responsible for the Stevenson murder,

11

but Respondent was nowhere to be found.

12

a jail and then they had to try something else.

13

They found him in

Secondly, the fact that Respondent was in jail

14

meant that Officer Parisi could approach him with a phony

15

escape plan rather than use some other type of ruse, such

16

as the ruse they would have used if they had found

17

Respondent at the motel.

18
19
20

But the fact that he was in jail did not in any
way coerce him into confessing.
Look at the case from his perspective and look

21

at the setting in which he found himself.

22

confess in order to avoid having the book thrown at him by

23

a known police officer?

24

hatching an escape plot with two fellow prisoners.

25

No.

So this newspaper reporter, he

wants to interview you for some future story, and they

11

sold him a bill of goods in selling the book rights, or

12

something, to his story.

13

Would that be permissible?

14

MR. LARKIN:

It would — it would depend because

15

it's — it's the part of your hypo that would have to be

16

elaborated.

17

If you don't have any real break, unlike here

18

where you really do, then, as a practical matter, you

19

could say that some of the intimidating presence of the

20

police officer would immediately carry over.

Well, those are two different —

as a priest, I mean.
MR. LARKIN:

Yeah.

They're two different hypos

and I would give different answers to each one.
I would say that Miranda wouldn't apply to

15

either one, but the latter one, with the priest, would

16

violate due process.

17

for purposes of this case, they would -- since this

mean, after all, the reason for having a police officer

there is a big distinction, a crucial one, we believe --

is that it was essential to Miranda that the suspect would

know that the person sitting across the table from him in

The police officer is the one who holds the
