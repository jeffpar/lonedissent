ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR E. WILMARTH, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. WILMARTH:

10
11
12

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This is an appeal by Gerald A. Lewis, Comptroller

13

of the State of Florida and head of the Florida Department

14

of Banking and Finance, from a decision of the United

15

States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.

16

case arose out of an application filed by Appellee

17

Continental Bank Corporation to establish a state

18

chartered industrial savings bank, to which I will refer

19

as an ISB, in Miami, Florida.

20

This

The court of appeals struck down three Florida

21

statutes which prohibited Continental from opening the

22

proposed ISB based on the Commerce Clause.

23

appeals also granted attorneys fees on appeal to

24

Continental, apparently based on 42 U.S.C. Sections 1983

25

and 1988.

The court of

Appellant Lewis maintains that the decision

below should be reversed for three reasons.
First, this case has become moot by reason of a

2

3

1987 amendment to the Federal Bank Holding Company Act.

4

Second, Section 664.02 of the Florida statutes, which

5

prohibits the issuance of any further ISB charters to any

6

person, represents a non-discriminatory exercise of

7

Florida's authority over the chartering of local banking

8

institutions.

9

Commerce Clause.

The statute is therefore lawful under the
And, as the court of appeals found, the

10

statute would thereby moot the case by precluding any

11

relief to Continental.

12

the dormant Commerce Clause do not vindicate any right

13

secured by the Constitution that is cognizable under 42

14

U.S.C. 1983.

15

attorneys fees under Section 1988.

16

Third, Continental's claims under

Accordingly, Continental cannot recover

issue.

18

Continental cannot now open the ISB for which it applied,

19

which was an FDIC insured ISB.

20

the Bank Holding Company Act and expanded the definition

21

of bank to include all FDIC insured institutions.

22

It is undisputed, as shown by the briefs, that

In 1987 Congress amended

Continental is an Illinois bank holding company.

23

Under the Douglas Amendment, Continental cannot acquire a

24

bank in Florida, unless Florida gives specific

25

authorization for Illinois bank holding companies to do

2

permitted Illinois bank holding companies to acquire banks

in Florida.

4

Again, it is undisputed that Florida has not

QUESTION:

Mr. Wilmarth, suppose instead of filing

5

an application for a particular bank, as they had done,

6

the plaintiffs here had brought a, simply brought a

7

declaratory judgment action prior to filing that

8

application, it being clear that the application would be

9

denied under the law in question, and asserted that the

10

law in question was unconstitutional?

11

declaratory judgment action properly lie?

12

MR. WILMARTH:

Would that

I do not believe so, Justice Scalia,

13

because there would have been both a standing problem, in

14

my view, and perhaps a rightness problem.

15

application pending under the statute, or in fact could

16

not show to this Court's satisfaction or the trial court's

17

satisfaction that they intended to open an ISB under the

18

statute, then obviously it would be merely a hypothetical,

19

speculative case, and would be asking only for an advisory

20

opinion, which is not within just issuability grounds.

21

And that is really the situation that we have —

QUESTION:

If they had no

Under the amended federal act, what is

left of this case?
MR. WILMARTH:

The only thing that is left, Justice

White, is whether or not Continental now actually intends

They cannot open an FDIC insured bank.

QUESTION:

They have

They have never made

They

Do you know if there are a lot of

institutions that accept deposits that aren't insured?
MR. WILMARTH:

I think we have said in our opening

10

brief that in our banking institutions today, less than

11

one half of one percent of deposits are uninsured.

12

everyone understands that federal deposit insurance is —

13
14
15

QUESTION:

That

That may be one reason there hasn't been

some unequivocal announcement.
MR. WILMARTH:

I think that is right, Your Honor.

16

In fact, as we mentioned, Continental has been the subject

17

of the largest FDIC bailout in history.

18

unlikely, in our view, that they could convince the

19

public, or would try to convince the public, to put

20

uninsured deposits on account in one of their

21

subsidiaries.

22

very skeptical about doing so.

23

It is highly

I think the public would justifiably be

1

that makes the case moot, and that the decision of the

2

court of appeals should be vacated and remanded on the

3

grounds of mootness.
QUESTION:

4

Well, of course, in cases like that

5

Granite Rock case from California, there was no absolute

6

assurance that the mining interests were going to

7

continue.

8

such that we can, we would like to continue.

9

very much like the kind of allegation the bank is making

They just said well, if economic conditions are
And that is

here.
MR. WILMARTH:

I would like to distinguish that, if

12

I could, Justice O'Connor, because I thought your opinion

13

in that case was very helpful.

14

company in that case said we have valuable mining claims

15

here, and we intend to pursue them, so long as that is

16

economically viable.

17

economically unviable, we will pursue them.

18

is exactly the opposite.

19

this case, and if we then decide that perhaps we could

20

succeed in an operation, we will apply.

21

very different kind of commitment.

22

yes, we will go ahead unless we find out later that it is

23

just not viable.

QUESTION:

25

You said that the mining

1

this uninsured permit or license, provided the economic

2

circumstances justify it.
MR. WILMARTH:

3

Yes, that is in fact the statement.

4

But it is my view that that is sort of saying we don't

5

absolutely commit at this time to go ahead, but we may go

6

ahead in the future if we decide that that is economically

7

viable.
QUESTION:

8

9

Is there anything that has prevented

Continental from applying in the past?
MR. WILMARTH:

10

Not to my knowledge, Your Honor.

11

The application has been stayed by the Florida

12

administrative authorities pending this Court, but we do

13

not know of anything that would have prevented them from

14

filing an amended application if they had desired to do

15

so.

I am not aware of any administrative bar.
If I might, I would then proceed to the Commerce

16
17

Clause issue.

It is our belief that Section 664.02 is

18

entirely non-discriminatory both on its face and in its

19

impact.

20

says that no one can now obtain an ISB charter, that

21

Comptroller Lewis is barred from granting any more

22

charters.

23

discriminatory but we should examine what that finding was

24

resting upon.

The statute is neutral on its face.

Florida under the Douglas Amendment and cannot acquire

2

full service banks, would wish to acquire ISBs because

3

they can't acquire full service banks.

4

We find that southeastern bank holding companies

5

probably wouldn't be interested in opening an ISB, because

6

they can acquire a full service bank.

7

amounts to is, they are saying a non-southeastern bank

8

holding company cannot acquire a full service bank.

9

southeastern bank holding company can.

What that really

A

But, of course,

10

that is the Douglas Amendment.

11

establishes that discrimination, and in Northeast Bancorp

12

this Court found that that discrimination was entirely

13

authorized by Congress under the Commerce Clause.

14

The Douglas Amendment

Section 60, 60 — I am sorry, 664.02, has no

15

independent discriminatory impact.

If the Douglas

16

.Amendment did not exist, there would be no case, because

17
18

QUESTION:

Well, do we, in determining whether

19

there is a discriminatory effect, do we look at the

20

statute independently of the Douglas Amendment, or in

21

tandem with it?

22

MR. WILMARTH:

What I would say the test might be,

23

Justice O'Connor, is does this statute add any

24

discrimination that does not already exist by virtue of

25

the Douglas Amendment.

It is our view that it does not,

because it equally withdraws ISB charters from everyone.

2

It does not add any discrimination, any differential

treatment.

MR. WILMARTH:

QUESTION:

I think —

-- BT —
BT Investment.

— Investment which held that plugging a

10

loophole in the Douglas Amendment violated the Commerce

11

Clause.

12

MR. WILMARTH:

I think that was a different case in

13

this respect.

In BT Investment, Florida said that we are

14

barring only out-of-state bank holding companies from

15

acquiring investment advisory subsidiaries.

16

to permit Florida bank holding companies to .continue

17

buying these things or establishing them.

18

had a discriminatory statute on its face and in its

19

impact, because they said we're only applying this statute

20

to out-of-state bank holding companies.

21

yes, we find, and the statutory legislative history on

22

page 31 of the joint appendix shows, that Lewis — I am

23

sorry, the state legislature, understood that these ISBs

24

were being applied for by Bank of America, Citicorp, and

25

Continental, for the very purpose of circumventing the

QUESTION:

5

Well, with respect —

— preserving a, preserving a local

preference.
MR. WILMARTH:

6

With respect, I think, as far as

7

Lewis was concerned, this was a very dangerous

8

development, because this meant that Florida could no

9

longer preserve a competitive and unconcentrated banking

10

environment that would be responsive to the needs of its

11

local consumers and businesses.

12

think, in retrospect, that Congress actually agreed with

13

Florida and in 1987 plugged the non-bank bank loop-hole,

14

finding that, exactly the same thing, that the non-bank

15

banks were undermining the states' abilities to choose

16

under the Douglas Amendment.

17

QUESTION:

And it is interesting, I

But suppose the statute said in its

18

preamble, in order to prevent states from outside the,

19

banks from outside the southeast region, from establishing

20

ISBs in the State of Florida, and to protect the existing

21

competitive environment within the State of Florida, we

there, I think that would be the same, in my view, that

knowledge of

reports, that what Florida is doing by establishing a

2

regional banking program is to preserve a competitive,

3

unconcentrated banking environment, and to provide for the

4

credit needs of local businesses and consumers.
QUESTION:

5

But at the time they did not have the

6

right to protect their regional banking scheme from, from

7

ISBs.

8

MR. WILMARTH:

Well, that, that of course was in

9

1984, and it is our view that the Commerce Clause did not

10

prevent them from taking a non-discriminatory step toward

11

withdrawing the option from everyone.

12

equivalent, I think, to what the Maryland legislature did

13

in Exxon Corp. versus Governor of Maryland, or in a sense

14

what Minnesota Clo —

15

QUESTION:

That that is really

Well, that, that may be a valid

16

argument, but it seems to me it doesn't respond to Justice

17

Kennedy's point, that the motivation was perfectly okay.

18

MR. WILMARTH:

19

QUESTION:

Well —

You're, you're — because the motivation

20

wasn't perfectly okay if they did not have a right to

21

preserve their regional, their regional system, against a

22

particular type of bank.

23

MR. WILMARTH:

Well, I think that the way I would

24

respond to that, Justice Scalia, is that the Douglas

25

Amendment did allow them to choose a regional approach.

QUESTION:

1

Yes, but didn't, but didn't allow them

2

to insulate it against one type of bank, which may have

3

been a mistake, but that was the federal law.

4

MR. WILMARTH:

5

QUESTION:

Well, our —

And you are saying that their motivation

6

was we want to insulate it even against this kind of bank.

7

And, now maybe what they did was objectively okay, but

8

that's a different question.

9

whether the motivation is on its face a thoroughly

10

We are just talking about

federally justified motivation.
MR. WILMARTH:

11

I see.

I suggest it isn't.

Well, I think that, to the

12

extent that legislators are presumed to know the law, one

13

could certainly presume that they understood that the

14

Commerce Clause allowed for non-discriminatory exercises

15

of authority over chartering.

16

for example, Section 7 of the Bank Holding Company Act as

17

interpreted in BT Investment, said that the states could

18

legitimately enact regulations of bank holding companies

19

and subsidiaries on a non-discriminatory, even-handed

20

basis.

21

for example, there have been cases holding that you can

22

deny an entire type of non-banking subsidiary to bank

23

holding companies, so long as you do it even-handedly.

24

That is, that is not discrimination.

25

That that has not been —

They were more restrictive than federal law.

QUESTION:

But the question is whether you are

And,

1

doing it even-handedly, when you grandfather in the

2

existing local institutions.
MR. WILMARTH:

3

Well, again I would say there that

4

it seems to me in two cases, the Clover Leaf Creamery and

5

the Dukes case, that you allowed very limited

6

grandfathering, where you found that the limited, the

7

grandfathering of the paperboard, the pulp, the pulp type

8

of paperboard milk cartons in Minnesota, did not strike

9

you as inherently discriminatory, or^the preservation of

10

the three push cart vendors in New Orleans did not strike

11

you as, inherently as discriminatory.
QUESTION:

12

13
14

case.

Well, that wasn't a Commerce Clause

That was an equal protection case.
MR. WILMARTH:

Yes, Dukes was.

Clover Leaf

15

Creamery was both, equal protection and Commerce Clause.

16

I also would say that I don't understand that in any of

17

your cases you have found, that even if you found a

18

discriminatory intent, that that was the case.

19

all the cases that I have read, for example, Philadelphia

20

versus New Jersey, Lewis versus BT Investment, and other

21

cases, Hunt versus Washington Apple Advertising

22

Commission, where you thought there was some indication of

23

protectionist intent, you always went further and said

24

well, the main test is what is the impact of the statute.

25

Is the statute discriminatory in its impact?

If I might then proceed at this time to the Section

We take the position that both the plain

language and the evident purposes of both the Commerce

11

Clause and the 1983 establish that the claim of violation

12

of the dormant Commerce Clause does not vindicate any

13

right secured by the Constitution, which, of course, is

14

the predicate for finding a Section 1983 remedy.

15

Preliminarily I would say that we have also shown

16

that, of course, 1983 fees would not be available here

17

unless Continental actually obtained some meaningful

relief.

the federal law change I have mentioned, or if you find it

20

to be moot because Section 664.02 is valid and therefore

prohibits the granting of the charter, then, in that case,

Continental has obtained no relief here, and under the

case such as Hewitt versus Helms and your Garland case

6

MR. WILMARTH:

Yes, we acknowledge that Continental

7

certainly has standing to complain of a violation of the

8

Commerce Clause, so that this is a case arising under the

9

federal Constitution within 1331, and they have standing

as a party aggrieved.
QUESTION:

But that is different —

How can you have standing to assert a

right that is not yours?
MR. WILMARTH:

Isn't that rather strange?

Well, I think in, for example cases

14

such as Clarke versus Securities Industry Association, you

15

have said that an indirect beneficiary of a statute, for

16

example, can assert a claim, even though they are not the

17

direct beneficiary.

ffect Continental.
Following that deposition, which I submit made it
fairly clear to all the parties that this administrative
policy wasn't going to prevent Continental from going
forward, is when the Florida legislature enacted the 1984
statute which is being challenged here, which completely
barred any out-of-state — excuse me, which completely
barred any ISB chartering authority in the future.

That

statute, as the Court has noted, grandfathered the
existing Florida ISBs.

It further had its, unlike the

rest of the banking legislation, had its effective date
accelerated.

It, as I said earlier, in its legislative

history makes clear that it was expressly directed at
Continental's application, and was enacted because
Continental obtained summary judgment in this case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gordon, you say that the statute,

the Florida statute in 1984 grandfathered existing Florida
ISBs.

Were there any other ISBs that could have been

grandfathered, but weren't?
MR. GORDON:

No.

They grandfathered the existing

ISBs.
QUESTION:

were.

QUESTION:

Yes, but when you are talking about

grandfathering, your argument could be read to suggest
that they grandfathered the Florida ISBs, but that there
were others similarly situated that weren't.

This was the line that Congress drew.
Well, but — but given the Florida

institutions if it chose, quite without regard to the

MR. GORDON:

ways .

2

So, isn't that really the causative statute which denies

3

you the right to engage in business that you choose, that

4

you are seeking?

5

That is the only reason you want the ISB.

MR. GORDON:

Justice, I suppose that we could have

6

a argument in a particular factual context, which I don't

7

know that we have here, where a statute of that sort might

8

be unconstitutional, if it had the purpose and effect of

9

discriminating against interstate commerce.

I am not sure

10

that the Florida statute, as presently written, there

11

either could be a factual record that could support that,

12

or, you know, that there would be those sorts of effects.

13

Let me turn to the — let me, I guess, give one

14

more response there.

I think that what the department is

15

trying to do here is to take the aura of Section 3(d) and

16

transport it, or transpose it, into other kinds of

17

activities that are Section 4(c)(8).

18

done is take the same argument that was rejected by this

19

Court in Lewis, and dressed it up in different clothes in

20

this case.

21

the department tried to say was that Section 3(d), by its

22

nature, in order to be effective, constituted

congressional authorization for discrimination as to

Section 4(c) (8 ) .

7

MR. GORDON:

Yes, Sir.

Justice Kennedy, my feeling

8

that this is an award for sanctions basically relates to

events at oral argument, where the eleventh circuit

But turning to the core 1983 issue, 1988 issue, our

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT-OF ARTHUR E. WILMARTH, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. WILMARTH:

3

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

4

First, with regard to the assertion that the court of

5

appeals could have based attorneys fees on a sanction for

6

bad faith conduct, as we indicated in our reply brief at

7

page 5, footnote 9, the Roadway Express versus Piper case

8

makes clear that in the absence of a finding of bad faith

9

conduct by the court of appeals, or by the-district court,

10

there can be no upholding of attorneys fees based on a

11

sanction.

12

finding by the court of appeals of bad faith conduct, nor

13

was there any finding by the district court of bad faith

14

conduct.

15

fees on that basis.

16

And Continental has admitted that there was no

incorporating.

So the motion added nothing, rather than just

21

With the question about whether unconstitutional

22

motivation is enough to strike down a state statute, or

24

of this Court that are relevant.

Palmer versus Thompson

1

the United States versus O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, which was

2

a First Amendment case involving a congressional statute

3

about burning draft cards.

4

said that there, it was disinclined to strike down a

5

statute based only on allegations of unconstitutional

6

motivation, because it is often very hard to determine

7

exactly what motivates each and every legislature.

8

think that those cases really repudiate the notion that

9

unconstitutional motivation, without any showing of

And in both cases this Court

So I

unconstitutional impact, is enough.
I think that the questions of Justice O'Connor and

12

Justice Kennedy indicated what we have been expressing,

13

which is that there is no showing that Florida was obliged

14

to open loopholes in the Douglas Amendment, that Florida

15

was somehow constitutionally required to open loopholes so

16

the Douglas Amendment wouldn't bite upon out-of-state bank

17

holding companies.

18

States indicated that they agreed with that position in

19

their jurisdictional brief at page 17, then we say for the

20

same reason it can't be a violation of the Commerce Clause

21

for Florida even-handedly to withdraw a chartering option

22
