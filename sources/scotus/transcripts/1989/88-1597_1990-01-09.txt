CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

the Westside Community Schools v. Bridget Mergens.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLEN E. DAUBMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. DAUBMAN:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents issues central to the

11
12

operation of co-curricular activities in the public

13

secondary schools in this country.

14

in that regard, obviously, is the equal access act, which

15

was enacted by Congress in the fall of 1984.

16

Of critical importance

The act basically provides that a school which

17

conducts, or has a limited open forum, may not deny access

18

to that forum on the basis of the political, philosophical

19

or religious content of speech.
In that regard, the Congress defined "limited

20
21

open forum" to mean when a school district grants an

22

opportunity for one or more noncurriculum-related student

23

groups to meet on school premises during noninstructional

24

time.

25

difficulty in school districts in trying to comply with

It is that statutory framework which causes

2

the act and meet their educational obligations.
The Equal Access Act, as we see it, basically

3

balances three concerns:

certainly the free speech rights

4

of students in our public schools; certainly also it

5

balances a concern of nonestablishment of religion; and

6

certainly also it affords deference to school officials,

7

affords them the autonomy and discretion to make

8

educational decisions.

9

In that context, we urge the Court to interpret

10

the act, interpret noncurriculum-related, as that term is

11

used in the act, to encompass a situation which is not

12

found at Westside High School.

13

and organizations at Westside High School were under, by

14

school board policy, the direct control and supervision of

15

the administration and shall have a faculty sponsor.

16

record is replete with testimony that the school officials

17

maintained an active role in practice, in determining the

18

goals and objectives of student clubs and organizations

19

and the manner in which those clubs and organizations

20

operated in their school.

21

QUESTION:

All of the student clubs

The

Well, Mr. Daubman, is there some

22

provision in the Federal act that at least with regard to

23

clubs covered by the act would limit the participation of

24

the faculty sponsor?

25

MR. DAUBMAN:

The act basically provides that a

1

school district that has a safe harbor provision, which

2

basically provides that a school district does not have to

3

provide a faculty sponsor, but if it does so in terms of a

4

role of a monitor, that that is permitted under the act.

5
6

QUESTION:

And it goes further and says the

sponsor will act as no more than a custodian, in effect?

7

MR. DAUBMAN:

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes.

That the faculty sponsor will not be

active?

10

MR. DAUBMAN:

11

QUESTION:

That is correct.

Do you suppose the act would be

12

applied so as to limit the participation of the sponsor

13

for the scuba class, for example — the Scuba Club?

14

MR. DAUBMAN:

The sponsor for the Scuba Club, in

15

our particular case there were really — there was a

16

faculty sponsor that was subject to the direction of the

17

administration.

18

QUESTION:

I'm just asking whether the Federal

19

act would apply across the board to all clubs covered by

20

the act, whether they are religious or not?

21

MR. DAUBMAN:

22

QUESTION:

That's correct.

So that the type of participation

23

you've been describing would not be permitted under the

24

Federal act by the faculty sponsor?

25

MR. DAUBMAN:

What -- the problem presented is

that we did not have a forum at the high school and

2

therefore not a forum under the Equal Access Act which

3

provided for custodial sponsors, but rather provided for

4

active participation.
QUESTION:

5
6

you did have a forum.

I thought the court below found that

MR. DAUBMAN:
otherwise.

The court below reversed that —

Right.

QUESTION:

12

MR. DAUBMAN:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

The district court found

That's correct.

Right.
And in that regard —

So we're talking about the present

situation.
Let me ask you one other question.

Does the

16

school have classes in the regularly offered courses for

17

credit in scuba and in chess?

18

MR. DAUBMAN:

No, it does not, Your Honor.

But

19

what our school district does have — what our high school

20

does have is an extensive physical education curriculum,

21

mandated at least in part by state educational guidelines

22

and the school district felt that the Scuba Diving Club,

23

called Subsurfers in our school, was certainly related to

24

that -- the regular curriculum offerings, to no lesser

25

extent, other than the degree of participation, than other

1

athletic endeavors that are maintained as co-curricular

2

activities, whether that be organized sports teams or

3

intramural competition — all of those activities.

4

QUESTION:

Yes, but am I correct, Mr. Daubman,

5

that even if you had no classes that related to scuba

6

diving or athletics you would still maintain that a Scuba

7

Club would be non — would be — would not make -- not

8

convert the school into a limited public forum, wouldn't

9

you?
MR. DAUBMAN:

10

That's not entirely correct.

The

11

-- if there were no physical education classes at the

12

school it would be difficult to say that that was one of

13

the educational objectives of the school, and therefore

14

the Scuba Diving Club related to that.

I don't think that

15
16

QUESTION:

I thought your test was a little —

17

was one that, if the school could sponsor the activity as

18

a curriculum activity, that it would be all right to have

19

a club, even though it didn't have a class.

20

For example, supposing you had a French Club,

21

but you had no French classes.

22

make it a — bring the act into play?

23

MR. DAUBMAN:

24

QUESTION:

25

Would you say that would

It would not —

Under your view.

There are many education —
QUESTION:

Well, say there's no foreign language

8

department -- let me push you -- but you still want to

9

have a French class on the theory that it's the kind of

10

activity a school can sponsor without getting into all

11

these sensitive issues?

12

MR. DAUBMAN:

If the club's object — goals and

13

objectives were instruction or discourse regarding the

14

French language, then I would agree with you.

15

to — if the goals and objectives of that club, as

16

developed through the faculty sponsor and the

17

administration, dealt with French culture or French

18

history, then there would be, I think, quite a strong

19

relationship to the European studies programs.

20

QUESTION:

If it was

Mr. Daubman, one of your clubs

21

involves helping handicapped children.

Wasn't that one of

22

the clubs which you related to your curriculum because you

23

said that it's part of the responsibility -- there is no

24

class in that.

justification?
MR. DAUBMAN:

2

Well, the name of the club, or the

3

activity, is Peer Advocates.

4

something that was initiated by a teacher as opposed by a

5

student and would therefore fall outside the act.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. DAUBMAN:

8

First of all, that was

Why is that?
Because the act talks about clubs

that are student initiated.
QUESTION:

9

Oh, that's for the club — for a club

10

to be entitled to be admitted under the act, it has to be

11

student initiated, but I don't read the act anywhere as

12

saying that for purposes of the test of the act, of

13

whether you're a limited forum, the club has to be student

14

initiated.

15

Where does it say that?
MR. DAUBMAN:

It — what it says is that the act

16

provides that student -- that it applies to student

17

initiated clubs.

18

QUESTION:

No, it says "a public secondary

19

school has a limited open forum whenever such school

20

grants an offering to or opportunity for one or more

21

noncurriculum-related student groups."

22

student initiated.

23

It does not say

It says student initiated later, when it

24

describes the type of club that is entitled to plead the

25

benefit of the act.

That has to be student-initiated, but

1

it seems to me that any act, whether it's -- any club,

2

whether it's initiated by the school itself or by a

3

student, triggers the act.
MR. DAUBMAN:

4

Quite apart from that, with

5

respect to Peer Advocates, the situation presented there -

6

- two points:

7

pretrial stipulation, in terms of what clubs were going to

8

be determined to be at issue as to whether they were

9

noncurriculum-related for purposes this — of this

first of all, that was — purposes of the

10

lawsuit, was raised for the first time on appeal in the

11

briefs.

12

It was not something that was tried to the trial

13

court and I don't believe it was even argued in the Eighth

14

Circuit, but discussed for the first time in briefs on

15

appeal here.

16

certainly, at trial or otherwise, to respond to that.

18

Therefore we did not have any opportunity,

QUESTION:
briefs?

Did you make this point in your

I don't --

19

MR. DAUBMAN:

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

What about the Chess Club?

21

how is that curriculum related?

as I recall.

That is related to math,

processes that are associated with that.

school, as shown by the record in this case, was something

2

that was conducted in the math — before it was a club,

3

was conducted in the math resource room at the urging, and

4

being allowed by the head of the math department because

5

of his feeling that it — those who participated actively

6

in chess became, and continue to be, better math students.

7

In the math resource room that became disruptive, and for

8

that reason it was relegated to a club situation --

9

QUESTION:

Could teachers at different schools

10

take different positions about whether or not the Chess

11

Club is curriculum related?

12

identical schools, two identical chess clubs, but one math

14

the other says it isn't.

that was undisputed.

Yes, it is.

In Omaha than we do.

I would suppose

12

we might just accept what the court of appeals said about

This was Judge Beam?

That is correct.

You're arguing now, Mr. Daubman, that

the high school did not have a limited open forum, is that
right?

11

MR. DAUBMAN:

12

QUESTION:

13

At the trial level, yes.

That's right.

You — are you asking us to construe

the Equal Access Act to reach that conclusion?

14

MR. DAUBMAN:

That's correct.

What the Equal

15

Access Act does, as I mentioned earlier, is balance those

16

three concerns.

17

It is very difficult for certainly this Court

18

and much more certainly for school officials to determine

19

on a case-by-case basis how close a relationship one needs

20

for a particular club activity as it relates to one or

21

more particular regular courses that are offered by the

22

school.

What was done in this case, or what our practice

24

had been at Westside High School for several years prior

to the passage of the Equal Access Act, was to treat and

run the co-curricular student clubs as part of the

educational program of the school.

3

That is to be, I think, very clearly

4

distinguished from the type of club activities which were

5

permitted in Widmar v. Vincent.

6

facilities for purposes of student meetings was allowed,

7

but at no time did the university in that case exercise

control over those student clubs and activities.

school setting is much different.

QUESTION:

Their access to school

Our high

I think that the Federal statute

11

prohibits that.

12

your sponsor argument.

13

state requires a faculty sponsor for all these other

14

groups, and since it can't provide the same kind of a

15

faculty sponsor for these groups, perhaps because of

16

establishment reasons, therefore it doesn't have to comply

17

with the act.

18

That -- that's why I didn't understand
You're saying since -- since the

But I don't — I think the act overrides your

19

ability to simply say, every student group will have a

20

faculty sponsor.

21

right to do that, any more than you have a right to say

22

every student group shall have no more than 30 people?

23

The act wouldn't permit you to exclude a religious group

24

that has 50 people on the basis that we don't have any

25

student groups with more than 30 people, would it?

Where — why do you think you have a

1

MR. DAUBMAN:

What the act does is provides a

2

definitional framework for when you have a limited open

3

forum triggering the applicability of that act, and it is

4

our contention that we did not have a limited open forum

5

under the terms of that act.

6

7
8

9

QUESTION:

Why?

Because you had a -- because

you had sponsors?
MR. DAUBMAN:

Primarily because we had — we did

not have noncurriculum-related student groups.

The fact

10

of a faculty sponsor and the control exercised by that

11

sponsor, as well as the supervision of that sponsor and

12

the answering to, by that sponsor, to the administration,

13

I think clearly shows that we did not have a situation

14

where simple access to building premises was allowed, but

15

rather there was active sponsorship and involvement by the

16

school district.

17

QUESTION:

That's all it takes to make it

18

faculty related, is that you have a sponsor on the faculty

19

who directs the group, and the group can be engaged in any

20

subject whatever.

21

think chess is faculty related, I hesitate to suggest

22

something that might not be.

23

think is and — and put a faculty sponsor in charge of it.

24

It would then be curriculum related?

25

I mean, pick whatever you want.

MR. DAUBMAN:

1

definition of curriculum-relatedness really goes to the

2

heart of what the school officials have chosen to do with

3

the co-curricular activities.

4

that as part of their curricular offerings of the school,

5

part of the educational program offered by the school.

MR. DAUBMAN:

I think Congress intended — I

17

know Congress intended that what ought to be done in terms

18

of the school district's response to the Equal Access Act

19

is to allow school districts in their discretion to make

20

educational decisions as to what academic and co-

21

curricular programs they're going to sponsor.

22

If a school district were to just blatantly say

23

no, everything we do here is curriculum related, therefore

24

the act doesn't apply, I think our trial courts are well

25

able to see a sham when one exists.

Equal Access Act addressed:

I think most of us who use the term

in the briefs of the Respondent and the government, the

"curriculum" in the same manner that was defined by, or

12

QUESTION:

Well, in your answer to Justice

Stevens you indicated that the Democrat or Republican Club

is, if you have a — excuse me — if you have a club

It's just that they are dealt with --

The school district did not -- does not — lend

QUESTION:

Not that

Under your view, Mr. Daubman,

9

supposing that a school, perhaps not Westside, but some

10

similar school, said we're going to have Republican and

11

Democratic Clubs as extensions of the curriculum, as

12

extensions of the civics class.

would it?

MR. DAUBMAN:

MR. SEKULOW:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

18

The students of Westside High School who desire

19

to form a student-initiated, student-led and voluntary

20

Bible club do acknowledge that the school officials have

21

important and oftentime delicate functions to perform with

22

regard to the operation of schools under their control.

23

However, these concerns do not justify the prohibition of

24

these students' Bible club from the Westside High School

campus.

1

At issue at Westside High School, and what is

2

before the court today is whether one or more

3

noncurriculum-related clubs existed, which would then

4

trigger Congress' Equal Access Act.

5

The Peer Advocates Club, which was discussed at

6

trial, was an admission by the principal himself that that

7

particular club was not related to any of the curriculum

8

activities of Westside High School.

9

The pretrial stipulation that was discussed by

10

the Petitioners' attorney related to ten clubs that were

11

designated to be discussed.

12

important to note that that same stipulation did not state

13

that they would -- that the Respondents would in any way

14

not challenge other club activities.

15

However, and I think it's

The school officials themselves have set forth,

16

if you will, the way in which to make the determination of

17

whether a particular club is related to the curriculum.

18

And our test for whether the act would be triggered would

19

be whether there is a direct relationship between the club

20

and a core curriculum course or a curriculum course.

21

For instance, in defining the clubs, as it has

22

in its — in the Joint Appendix there is a listing of the

23

Also, the act does not —

QUESTION:

What you're saying is

7

Congress wanted the schools to make the choice between

and all that.

MR. SEKULOW:

Because that is — Congress

unlawful and a group that was promoting the use —

8

QUESTION:

No, not the use, just the —

advocating change in the law to make it permissible.

9

MR. SEKULOW:

That would be covered by the act.

10

That would -- that is the price -- that's the price of

11

freedom and what — in fact, one of the early cases

12

involving the implementation of the Equal Access Act

13

involved political speech:

14

Student Coalition for Peace.

They wanted to form a group to discuss nuclear

15

freezing, and they were denied access, and they, in fact,

16

utilized the Equal Access Act, and the Third Circuit did,

17

in fact, grant them equal access.

18

But what the act also does, and as the

19

Petitioners have conceded today, we're not — and I think

20

the act really does protect this -- Congress did not ask

21

the schools to surrender control to the facilities.

22

did not say, if you will, open the door for the parade of

23

horribles.

2

to be that real parade of horribles.

3

Now, Congress was concerned about groups going

4

over the line, if you will, and what I mean by the line,

5

it's advocating illegal activity and things like that.

6

And Congress was specific, number one, adopted

7

the test that this court enunciated in Tinker in saying

8

that any type of group or organization that would be

9

materially disruptive or interfere with other students'

10

right to learn would, in fact, not have to take place in

11

the school.

12

Also, going further than what was really

13

addressed in Tinker, and different as well, Congress

14

sought to make sure that school administrators, as the

15

Petitioners in fact have stated, would be entitled to

16

protect the well-being of students under their control.

17

And I want to state here that the only club that

18

has been denied access based on the content of the speech

19

in this particular case has been the proposed Bible club

20

which was to meet --

We agree that that could have been

QUESTION:

But isn't it also true that the

17

school policy had been rather clear that they would not

18

permit a Young Republican or a Young Democrats club to be

formed, so there was -- probably nobody would bother to

20

apply.

MR. SEKULOW:

Well, Your Honor, that is correct.

However, that's — as Justice Scalia stated, that's

Do you agree that could be done under

MR. SEKULOW:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

There's

no question that the schools have to -- do not have to

12

allow any type of extracurricular activity.

13

We take it a step further, and one of the

14

concerns that we expressed in our brief is that there are

15

other constitutional implications here, but under the act

16

they certainly have that type of discretion to absolutely

close down the forum if they so elect.

And that is this:

The school

— it's really unequivocal that informal meetings on a

regular basis, even so far as meeting at lunch on a

10

regular basis with a Bible open and discussing the Bible

11

or these students discussing each other's spiritual

concerns that they had or religious concerns that they had

or religious viewpoints, if that was done on a regular

basis during lunch, not any kind of extracurricular

Did the school board say — say why

they would close down the clubs if this case went against

MR. SEKULOW:

That they — yes.

Their position

22

is that at Westside High School they desire — the

rationale they gave was to present a balanced view, and

that allowing this type of speech activity would not

ranging from abortion to homosexuality to drug abuse.

what they've really done is deny these students the right,

that the best way to take a look at it was one of the

What Congress meant by curriculum related in

That the Equal Access Act, if you will, becomes

That anything that's related to missions and

in the lower court.

And I think the Eighth Circuit

specifically, albeit not as detailed as we would like,
rejected that proposal by stating that the Chess Club, as

to curriculum and therefore the Equal Access Act would
have applied.
And in the context of this particular forum,
with the 30 other clubs there's a — and again, in the
joint appendix, if we're looking for the test, the school
officials had no trouble in doing -- in implementing the

state, for instance, that the Band Club is a part of the

the Court:

3

In the view of the United States, careful study

of this statute and of the record compiled by the Congress

in the course of considering, of vigorously debating and

enacting this measure, reveals two overriding concerns or

12

As one of the co-sponsors of this overwhelmingly

bipartisan measure, Senator Leahy of Vermont put it, this

14

bill makes an important statement about ideas.

15

that ideas are sacred to Americans, whether or not they

You don't find in the legislative

history a predominant interest in protecting the religious

groups?

10

MR. STARR:

Oh, I think the primary thrust was

11

to protect religious liberty, because the problem that

12

presented itself to Congress was one of discrimination

13

that was visited on the heads of students who wanted to

14

participate in religious discussion.

15

It is quite clear, it could not be clearer, that

16

the purpose of this statute was to eliminate

discrimination against students who were religious and who

wanted to engage in religious discussion voluntarily.

quite agree with that.

MR. STARR:

I believe its authority derives

20

also by virtue of the statement with respect to any number

22

It has to be the latter, I think.

2

MR. STARR:

Well, however, Justice Stevens, that

3

the Congress saw fit to apply this statute only to schools

4

that receive federal financial assistance, I suppose if we

5

had a Grove City kind, as it were, of public school system

6

that eschewed any federal funds, this would not apply.

7

Although I would think that under this Court's decisions

8

under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, there might

9

very well be power to reach that school (inaudible).
But Congress saw fit not to exercise the

10
11

entirety of its power in that respect.
The discussion has been not about Congress'

12

13

purposes and intentions and motives at all, but rather

14

with respect to the meaning of curriculum related.

15

There are three reasons why we would urge to the

16

Court not to embrace the school district's open-ended

17

approach.

18

inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of the word

20

We believe, first, that its approach is quite

because, Justice Stevens, it seems to me that it's rather

It is —

QUESTION:

Is your test, the literal one, the

4

same one, and if you don't have a French class but you

5

have a French club, that triggers the act, too?

6

MR. STARR:

It is certainly clear that Congress

7

was focusing on what the course work was.

However, it

8

also was mindful of the fact that there is a history of

9

competitive athletics — and I think it's quite clear in

10

the legislative history that Congress did view the

11

athletic teams as not creating a limited open forum.

12

QUESTION:

And — and is that legislative

13

history sufficient, in your view, to overcome the plain

14

language of the act?

15

MR. STARR:

Oh, I don't think that the plain

16

language, with respect to a student group wishing to

17

conduct a meeting, is crystal clear with respect to the

18

football team.

I think it is clear with respect to the —

They may.

students coming together in school wanted to pursue areas

and activities of interest to the students; administrators

were resistant to that.

of time, school administrators began permitting students

5

to pursue their interests just as Westside and other high

schools across the country have seen fit to do here.

QUESTION:

And ultimately, in the fullness

Well, I gather if you — you say

8

there has to be some connection with some particular part

of the curriculum.

I suppose that would vary then from

semester to semester as to whether the French Club was or

11

wasn't within the act, or whether some of these other

12

things would --

MR. STARR:

I don't believe that the course

would have to be offered every single semester.

would have to relate to course work.

It will be recalled that Senator Gorton thought that the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALLEN E. DAUBMAN

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

16

MR. DAUBMAN:

The test proposed by the

17

Respondents and by the government is contrary to the act

18

and is educationally unworkable.

19

students work with the handicapped at school, our regular

20

ed students, so they can learn to be sensitive to the

21

handicapped to characterize that as noncurriculum related,

22

but to say that a football team, even in the absence of a

23

physical education program at the high school is

24

curriculum related creates unworkable and --

Service clubs also indicated by the legislative

In our school district the record is clear that

activities with service clubs could constitute — in some

cases required over the years, in other cases could be

Again, to say that a particular type of club is

noncurriculum related for all purposes I think really

stifles the efforts of educators to deal with curriculum

educational benefit to its students.
