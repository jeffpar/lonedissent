MR. SLOAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

10

In 1969 Congress enacted a provision addressing

11

the tax treatment of the income of social clubs and in that

provision Congress treated social clubs differently from

other tax-exempt organizations.

14

With respect to other tax-exempt organizations,

15

Congress imposed a tax only on the income from an unrelated

trade or business.

imposed a tax on all income except for what was called the

18
