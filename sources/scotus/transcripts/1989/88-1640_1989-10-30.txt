ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM B. SCHULTZ

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. SCHULTZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:

11

This case seeks review of a decision former Attorney

12

General Edwin Meese to grant a joint operating arrangement, or

13

JOA, to the seventh and eighth largest newspapers in the

14

country, the Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press.

15

The JOA would allow the papers to jointly set circulation

16

and advertising prices.

17

the Detroit market so that the Free Press would be the morning

18

paper and the News would be the afternoon paper and they would

19

publish a joint weekend edition.

It would also allow them to divide

20

Such an agreement would ordinarily violate the antitrust

21

laws, but in 1970 Congress adopted the Newspaper Preservation

22

Act which gave the Attorney General the authority to grant an

23

antitrust exemption to newspapers in limited circumstances.

24
25

Petitioners' challenge is based on three arguments, each
of which I will address.

The first is that the joint

1

operating agreement here is not consistent with the purposes,

2

structure and policies of the Newspaper Preservation Act.

3

Second, the record here does not support the Attorney-

4

General's finding that the Free Press was in probable danger

5

of financial failure.

6

7
8
9

And third, the court of appeals erred in not applying the
rule that antitrust exemptions must be narrowly construed.
Before I get to those legal issues, there are three
critical facts that I would like to highlight that distinguish

10

this case from every other JOA application.

11

facts was either adopted by the Attorney General or by the

12

administrative law judge whose fact-findings the Attorney

13

General accepted, and, therefore, they are established facts

14

for purposes of the legal issues here.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Each of these

Mr. Schultz, we review this under an arbitrary

and capricious standard?
MR. SCHULTZ:

Your Honor, the factual issues would be

18

reviewed under an arbitrary and capricious standard.

20

QUESTION:

The

So when we're talking about facts are

21

established by record, we're not quite in the same ball park

22

as if you're appealing from a jury verdict or findings of a

23

court.

24
25

MR. SCHULTZ:

Well, and these are facts about which I

don't believe there is dispute.

They're facts that were —

QUESTION:

Well, but the overall standard of review is

2

arbitrary and capricious, not supported by

substantial record — evidence considered on the record as a

whole.

MR. SCHULTZ:

That's correct.

capricious or otherwise —
QUESTION:

So you — you have a much greater burden to -

to upset a determination here where you're just under the
arbitrary and capricious standard.

10

MR. SCHULTZ:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. SCHULTZ:

Or otherwise not in violation of law.

Yeah.
So on the factual issues it would be

13

arbitrary and capricious.

14

whether there's a violation of law.

15

It's arbitrary and

On the legal issues it would be

The first of these critical facts is that the newspapers

16

fought the competitive battle in Detroit to a virtual draw.

17

Those are their words as they described the competitive

18

situation at the time they announced the JOA.

19

assessment establishes that the papers considered themselves

20

to be competitive equals.

21

And this

The — Free — the record shows that the Free Press had

22

been losing money and that the News — the News had been

23

losing almost as much.

24

the two papers was roughly equal, and in other areas each had

25

advantages.

It shows that the daily circulation o

The News was ahead in advertising, but on the

1

other hand, this was offset by the fact that the Free Press

2

had the morning franchise, had clear dominance in the morning

3

franchise, which was considered a major advantage.

4

And also important is the fact for at least ten years

5

there had been no movement in the relative market position of

6

these two papers.

7

distinguishes the JOA here from every one — other one

8

previously considered and approved by the Attorney General.

9

In each of those other situations, there was one paper

This situation, this whole set of facts,

10

that was dominant and profitable and a second paper that was

11

junior, losing money and had been losing both circulation and

12

advertising.

13

QUESTION:

Well, the only difference here from that fact

14

that if — you just recited is that it wasn't losing

15

circulation but it was losing money year after year, was it

16

not?

17

MR. SCHULTZ:

The Free Press was losing money, but the

18

News here was also losing almost as much, whereas in the other

19

situations the paper not designated failing was profitable.

20
21

QUESTION:

So you consider that a stable situation, in

which both newspapers are losing money every year?

22

MR. SCHULTZ:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. SCHULTZ:

25

Well, I didn't say —

That is stability?
I didn't say — I didn't mean to say it was

stable, but I'm saying that they are — they are equals.

They

1

are at the same level, and that it hadn't changed, that the

2

circulation and advertising had not changed over ten years.

3

They'd been fighting for that, and — and that's very

4

different from what we see —

5

QUESTION:

It's different, but maybe I was jumping ahead

6

of you.

7

that it indicates in this situation a stable, you know, a

8

stable competitive arrangement, whereas in the other

9

situations there was not a stable arrangement.

10

I thought the reason you thought it was different is

It -- it

seemed to be deteriorating.

11

MR. SCHULTZ:

12

QUESTION:

Well, let me say in the —

Don't you think it's deteriorating if —if one

13

paper's losing a lot of money every year, year after year,

14

despite the fact that there's no difference in circulation?

15

MR. SCHULTZ:

Well, the papers obviously don't want to

16

lose money.

17

the Detroit Free Press

18

financially?

19

That's not a good thing.

But the question is, is

in probable danger of failing

Is it in probable danger

of — of closing?

And I am simply saying that the fact that they're

20

competitive equals suggests that — that that's not the case,

21

particularly when you consider the reason that the Free Press

22

and the News are losing money.

23

because of any problem with the market

in Detroit.

24

Attorney General found that the market

in Detroit could

25

support two healthy newspapers.

They're not losing money
The

Instead, everyone has agreed

1
2

that they are losing money because their prices are too low.
The — the newsstand price for the Detroit News is 15

3

cents.

4

Similarly, advertising prices are the lowest in the country.

5

And so this is not a — a situation as we've seen in other

6

cities where, again, where one's making money and one's

7

losing.

8
9

The newsstand price for the Free Press is 20 cents.

They're losing money because the prices are too low.

And just to highlight this, the fact that they regarded
each other as competitive equals, when they drew up the joint

10

operating arrangement they made a decision to split profits

11

50-50.

12

that the papers regarded themselves as competitively equal.

13

This, in our view, is further and very strong evidence

It's strong evidence that the News did not think that the

14

Free Press was likely to go out of business anytime soon

15

because, after all, if it viewed the Free Press as being

16

likely to close down in the near future, it would have made no

17

sense for it to have split these enormous possible monopoly

18

profits evenly.

19

Again, the profit split here contrasts dramatically with

20

the profit split that was evident in other JOAs approved by

21

the Attorney General.

22

profit split, where the dominant profitable paper took most of

23

the profits and the junior paper took a much smaller

24

percentage, under 30 percent in every case.

25

QUESTION:

Each one of those involved a lopsided

On that kind of reasoning, you would

automatically invalidate any — any JOA that's approved by the

2

Justice Department which ends up in a -- in a 50-50 split, I

3

suppose?

4
5
6

MR. SCHULTZ:

I don't know that I would automatically

invalidate it, but I would be very skeptical of it.
There is one situation I can think of where it might be

7

appropriate, and that would be the situation where there was a

8

finding that the market could support only one paper, and also

9

if there was a — there might be some other facts that were

10

different here, but if there was kind of finding it would be a

11

stronger place.

12

But I — I do regard —

13

QUESTION:

What is the usual split?

I don't

— I don't

14

know what these — how these things — I mean, is it — is it

15

unusual to have a 50-50 split like that?

16

MR. SCHULTZ:

In terms of the JOAs after 1970, which is -

17

- those are the only ones that have been approved by the

18

Attorney General, the profit splits have been between 80/20

19

and, I think, 68/32.

20

this is very unusual.

21

That's the range of the other JOA.

So

Now there were some 50-50 profit splits in the old JOAs,

22

but, of course, those are evaluated under a much different

23

standard, and they were entered at a time when there was no

24

requirement that there be a showing that one of the newspapers

25

be in probable danger of — of financial failure.

1

So, in the circumstances of a market that can support two

2

newspapers, we would argue that where there's a 50-50 profit

3

split and other evidence that the papers are competitively

4

equal, that the newspapers cannot qualify for approval of a

5

joint operating agreement.

6

QUESTION:

If we're intending to ensure some competition

7

before a JOA agreement, it's hard for me to understand how you

8

criticize the fact that the Knight-Ridder operation fought the

9

other newspaper to a draw.

10

*1 think that's exactly what you

want to encourage.
MR. SCHULTZ:

Your Honor, I don't think, Justice Kennedy

QUESTION:

fighting hard?

15

to do before a JOA agreement?

16

I mean, what's wrong with each newspaper
I thought that's exactly what you're supposed

MR. SCHULTZ:

You want the papers to fight hard, but

17

Congress also required that there be:

18

of the papers is in probable danger of financial failure, and

19

in that view that does not envision fighting to a draw; and

20

secondly, that it be consistent with the purposes of the

21

statute.

22

(a) a finding that one

And one of the troubling — one of the most troubling

23

aspects of the JOA here is that its approval, the approval of

24

the JOA in Detroit, the one at issue in this case, will result

25

in a loss of competition in other healthy competitive markets

in the United States, which would be contrary to the purpose

2

of the Newspaper Preservation Act.
After the statute, there are three possibilities

that can occur in competitive newspaper markets.

5

up with full competition.

6

they could end up with a monopoly, single monopoly paper and

7

no competition.

They could end up with a JOA, or

And Congress clearly set an order for those

priorities.

The statute expresses the view that the most

10

desirable result would be a situation of competition where the

11

papers are competing in terms of price and news and so on.

12

The second choice is a JOA which retains two

13

newspapers but eliminates commercial competition, and the

14

least desirable outcome is a single monopoly paper where

15

competition is eliminated altogether.

16

QUESTION:

May I interrupt you, Mr. Schultz?

17

said you had three critical facts.

18

papers were relative equals.

You

One of them was that two

What were the other two that you

MR. SCHULTZ:

answer to Justice Scalia's question, are the 50-50 profit

split —

QUESTION:

MR. SCHULTZ:

25

Right.
Which is the newspaper's own

recognition that they're competitive equals, and the third one

1

is the fact that the Attorney General found that the Detroit

2

market can support two profitable newspapers.

3

QUESTION:

Okay.

4

MR. SCHULTZ:

And so the losses here are not caused

5

by a depression or problem in the market.

6

caused by their prices being so low.

7

QUESTION:

Rather, they're

You don't attach any special significance

8

to the fact that the production costs of the News are higher

9

than those of the Free Press?
MR. SCHULTZ:

10

We have not.

If anything, I guess

11

they — they cut somewhat in our favor, but the — I believe

12

that was noted by the administrative law judge.

13

something we've highlighted, because he didn't either.

14

It's not

The Newspaper Preservation Act expresses a strong

15

policy preference for full competition over a JOA in several

16

respects.

17

definition for the term "failing paper."

First of all, Congress adopted a very narrow

18

Secondly, in the purpose section of the statute it

19

refers to the interest in newspapers that are competitive in

20

all parts of the United States, and then it explicitly

21

required the Attorney General to find that any JOA he approved

22

was consistent with those purposes.

23

And, finally, the antitrust rule that exemptions

24

from the antitrust laws be narrowly construed has the effect

25

of retaining the full force of the antitrust laws as much as

2

possible where the exemptions don't apply.
Therefore, one of the underlying policies of the

3

Newspaper Preservation Act is that it cannot be interpreted.

4

It may not be interpreted in a way that will give incentives

5

in other markets and result in healthy competitive markets

6

being converted into markets where newspapers operate under

7

JOAs approved by the Attorney General.

8

Here the Attorney General's decision violates that

9

policy because essentially it creates a road map under which

10

newspapers in healthy competitive markets can obtain a JOA,

11

and all they have to do under that decision is the following.

12

The first step is for one of the papers to cut

13

prices as happened in Detroit.

14

followed by a price cut by the other paper, by the second

15

paper, which would be necessary in order not to lose

16

circulation in advertising, and those price cuts would be

17

followed by several years of losses.

18

That presumably will be

application was made.

newspaper had substantially more losses, they would find a

1

was the situation here.
Accompanying the application would have to be the

2

3

testimony from officials of the paper not designated as

4

failing that they will not raise their prices even if the

5

exemption is not granted.

6

hard to get, given the interest that those officials have, and

7

for good measure they can add the testimony from officials of

8

the failing paper that that paper will close if the JOA isn't

9

granted.

10

11

Well, that testimony should not be

That testimony also wds presented in the case of the

Detroit application.
And, thus, the risk of the decision is that it will

12

result in the artificial generation of joint operating

13

agreements in other markets around the country.

14

Newspapers have — the problem is — is enhanced by

15

the fact that newspapers have a terrific incentive to try and

16

obtain approval of Joint operating arrangements, and this can

17

also be seen from the fagts of Detroit.

18

In Detroit neither of these newspapers has ever made

19

more than $15 million a year, and of course there are many

20

years during which each has made far less.

21

predicts that if the JOA is approved, by the fifth year the

22

newspapers jointly will be making $100 million a year.

23

you can see that the profit possibilities are enormous and

24

thus, if newspapers in — in other markets are given a way

25

that they can obtain a JOA through something as simple as

Would you invest in that paper?

— that seems to be a pretty risky

I — I think —

But — yeah, except — except what

happened here is Knight-Ridder — and this would typically be

the situation — Knight-Ridder's first choice wasn't a JOA.

18

Their first choice was to drive the News out of business, and

19

that's what they hoped to do.

20

But when you know that as a fail-back you can get a

getting one, it makes it — it makes it much more likely and -

would have been better in your view if Knight-Ridder hadn't

entered the market at all?

3

MR. SCHULTZ:

QUESTION:

Under your view, there's no chance of

getting into a joint operating agreement, so you just don't

If Knight-Ridder had not kept prices

That's another point altogether.

get a joint operating agreement, that all other newspapers

14

should be warned not to do this.

15

MR. SCHULTZ:

They lost $81 million in

Well, what we say is that they should

16

not be given a joint operating agreement here because —

17

that's right, because.to do so under this argument is going to

18

jeopardize the situation in other healthy markets.

19

I don't believe that there's likely to ever be a

20

stronger case than — than the case in Detroit, both because

21

In addition, when Gannett bought the News

that it had considered a price rise, but decided not to raise

That was — that's the — that's the only evidence

QUESTION:

In your view, is it essential to sustain

the Attorney General's position that we accept the credibility

7

MR. SCHULTZ:

Yes.

Absolutely.

Because that's the

Another problem with his finding is that essentially

12

what the Attorney General is — is saying is that the News —

13

it's rational, and that the News will engage in conduct that

14

essentially amounts to predatory pricing.

15

The cases of this court take a very different view,

16

which is that firms, in the long run, will not choose to lose

17

money in order to drive a competitor out of business.

MR. SCHULTZ:

1

Yes, Justice Scalia, they — they

2

were, but during those five years, there were continual

3

discussions about the prospects of a JOA, and the question has

4

to be, what would happen if they're told they can't get a JOA

5

with this kind of conduct.

6

We agree that this conduct may be rational — it is

7

rational if at the end of the road you can be assured or even

8

have a good chance of getting a joint operating arrangement.

9

Again, the only evidence relied on by the Attorney

10

General was the testimony of — of the News, and that simply

11

cannot be sufficient under the applicable standards.

12

I'd like to say just a word about the Chevron issue,

13

since that was one of the questions presented.

14

majority held that Chevron — the panel majority below held

15

that Chevron requires so much deference to the Attorney

16

General as to make a difference in the outcome of the case.

17

We regard that holding as wrong.

18

nothing more than a way of determining legislative intent.

And essentially it says that Congress, in a typical

administrative statute, intends for the agencies to take the

10

MR. SCHULTZ:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. SCHULTZ:

Well, I think we have both.

What's the issue of law?
The issue of law is whether granting

13

the JOA in the — in the undisputed circumstances here, is

going to be inconsistent with the policies of the statute

MR. SCHULTZ:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS W. MERRILL

4

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. MERRILL:

5
6

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

7

Mr. Schultz started by giving you three facts; I'm

8

going to give you four facts.

The difference between my four

9

facts and his three facts are that mine are the facts that the

10

Attorney General relied upon in making his decision in this

11

case to approve the joint operating agreement between the two

12

newspapers.

13

Before I do that, though, let me make two general

14

remarks about the nature of the argument that you've heard

15

today and that Petitioners advance in their briefs.

16

First of all, the Newspaper Preservation Act makes

17

it clear that Congress delegated authority to the Attorney

18

General to approve or disapprove a joint operating agreement,

19

not to the antitrust division, nor to the administrative law

20

judge.

21

General and not the ALJ, which is entitled to deference.

22

Thus, the decisions — the decision of the Attorney

And it's clear, as the Petitioners have conceded,

23

that the applicable standard of review is a highly deferential

24

one, whether or not that decision was arbitrary, capricious,

25

or an abuse of discretion.

about the types of factual determinations that could be made

on this record, I think that the most you can say is that the

that are being drawn from the evidence.

executive who says they will maintain the low prices until

MR. MERRILL:

Right.

Well, with respect to that

point, the administrative law judge said that, you know, he

thought that the — the witness's demeanor was improper or

21

that he had sweaty palms —

2

that it was — did not reflect unsound business judgment for

3

the Gannett chairman to testify as he did.

4

And the Attorney General, in contrast, said

Because what he was testifying to was entirely

5

consistent with what Congress had found to be the economic

6

circumstances of the newspaper industry and what the record in

the cases the Attorney General construed it, suggested to be

the economic condition of the newspaper industry.

10

QUESTION:

Is it your view we should accept that

testimony?
MR. MERRILL:

11

I think that that testimony is simply

12

one of several factors that the Attorney General was relying

13

upon —

14

QUESTION:

That's not my question.

Do you think we

should accept that testimony as true, that the chief executive

of a large newspaper, which has been losing money for five

years, millions and millions of dollars, would continue to

lose money until he is successful in driving his competitor

There is no suggestion that the News

They're losing money, but that could simply mean

12

that the newspaper industry has high fixed costs, and

13

therefore, at the pricing that they're — that they're engaged

14

in, they don't recover the totality of their fixed costs.

15

I don't think that would necessarily constitute

predatory pricing.
If, in fact, any newspaper is engaged in — in what

18

constitutes predatory pricing, yes, I think the Justice

19

Department would look at that quite seriously.

the Attorney General's opinion clearly indicates that he

regards the News as the stronger paper, as the paper with the

greater reserves and the greater ability to — to outlast the

Free Press at this point in time.
There's not a finding that the News was dominant in

the sense in which you talk about a dominant paper versus a

failing newspaper, nor is there any finding here of a downward

spiral, but the Attorney General indicates that the News, in

his opinion, is clearly in a superior position.

I think the

QUESTION:

Doesn't it also mean that the reason the

decision of the News to keep their prices low is a reasonable,

rational business decision is that they can predict that they,

MR. MERRILL:

Well, I think the News was — would --

First of all, they would look at

the fact that they have — earn 60 percent of the total

percent, that they have real strengths in the revenue — and

For

the classified advertising in this market.
But it's not just the fact that they have those

throughout this period, and I'm talking now from '83-'84 to

'85-'86, when the Free Press has basically broken off JOA

discussions with Evening News Association, the closely-held

company that then ran the News, and has initiated this thing

called Operation Tiger, where the Free Press is trying

everything it possibly can to improve the quality of its

The relative percentages of the News and the Free

Free Press is pulling out all the stops competitively to try

to do everything it can to obtain a dominant position in this

and then all of a sudden having Gannett show up and purchase

there's a question there?
MR. MERRILL:

Not necessarily, because as I tried to

explain before, it's — it's conceivable

I appreciate that, but after it has been

— been identified that one of the papers will go out of

to continue with that kind of pricing?

and is it then permissible for the other paper to say well, in

order to ensure that result, we will continue to lose money

for whatever period of time it takes to achieve that result?

Do you think that raises a question that even warrants

inquiry?

MR. MERRILL:

That is a different question — I

the newspapers negotiated JOA in 1985.

hadn't exchanged complete financial data.

I'm not

1

But anyway, in 1985, at the time the negotiations

2

takes place, the News doesn't know what the Free Press'

3

intentions are and vice versa; the Free Press doesn't know

4

what the News' intentions are.

5

It makes sense under those circumstances, I think,

6

to reach the type of agreement they had, and I don't think

7

that any conclusion could be drawn at all at that point in

time about the intentions of — of the parties that — that

you're speaking of.

10

Now, now — whether the Attorney General sua sponte

11

thought that something — some inquiry should have been made

12

based on this — this later testimony or not, I just don't

think that that was presented to him, nor was it particularly

relevant to the question of whether or not the JOA, given the

circumstances under which it —

argument that it's unlawful to drive your competitor out of

grant the JOA because you can predict that that's exactly

what's going to happen?

that should prevent the JOA from being granted?
MR.

3

MERRILL:

Yes, I will agree with that

statement.

4

QUESTION:

All right.

5

MR. MERRILL:

I think that — it's quite consistent

6

with what the Attorney General has said here.

I think that in

7

terms of analyzing this — this rather illusive question about

8

the mixed motives that the petitioners have presented, that it

9

— it's very important to distinguish between vigorous,

10

energetic, lawful competitive activity and anticompetitive

11

activity.

12

It seems to me that it's safe to infer from the

13

Attorney General's decision and safe, based on everything I

14

know about what the Justice Department has done in this area

15

in the past, that if the parties have engaged in any kind of

16

anticompetitive activity in order to try to secure a JOA, that

17

that would be sufficient grounds under the policies and

18

purposes inquiry to deny it.

19

For example, if there were any evidence that they

20

had conspired or colluded in order to get a JOA, which is

21

really what the road map suggestion amounts to, that somehow

22

papers are going to see this decision and think that they can

23

go out and enter into some kind of agreement to lose money for

24

five or six years and then one of them will testify that he

25

won't raise prices and so forth and he'll go get the JOA.

If there's any suggestion of that, I think it's

2

quite clear that it would be proper to deny the application.

3

If there was a suggestion that predatory pricing had, in fact,

4

been responsible for these losses or for driving one of the

5

papers out of business, I think it would be proper to deny the

6

JOA and —
QUESTION:

7

I'm not suggesting predatory pricing in

8

the past, but the point would be that the only way in which

9

the predicted result would take place is if it's depending on

10

predatory pricing in the future when there's already been a

11

declaration by one paper that I'm not going to stick in the

12

market if you keep pricing this way, and the other one says

13

well, I'll continue to lose money until I achieve my goal.

14

MR. MERRILL:

15

QUESTION:

If — if I —

If you consider that to be unlawful —

16

and I accept your point that you don't know enough about costs

17

and so forth to draw that in —

18

MR. MERRILL:

19

I want to be careful about what I say

here.

20

QUESTION:

Yeah.

21

MR. MERRILL:

I will not concede that it would have

22

been predatory, it was predatory or anything like that.

23

think that that kind of claim is completely barred by

24

principles of exhaustion of remedies.

at all.

However, if you did have reason to believe that the

only reason the paper was going to go out of business was

because of post-agreement predatory activity, I would agree

with you, yes.

that's not this case — at least that's not the record that

QUESTION:

11

Mr. Merrill, you don't strictly speaking

1

really get into this matter in this particular case.

2

to me that the first thing you'd want to ask yourself before

3

you plunge down some road examining the nuances of the Chevron

4

doctrine is, is there a disputed question of law in this case

5

wherein the administrative decision-maker decided that the

6

statute meant one thing, and the petitioners are claiming it

7

means something else.
And petitioners obviously disagree with this

8

9

It seems

decision.

They think it's arbitrary and capricious, but I'm

10

having great difficulty — a great deal of difficulty --

11

ascertaining exactly wherein they think the Attorney General

12

adopted a construction of the Newspaper Preservation Act which

13

is contrary to the intent of Congress.

14

Judge Silberman, interestingly enough, thought that

15

the point of disagreement was that petitioners were

16

maintaining that you couldn't get a joint operating agreement

17

unless you were in a downward spiral.

18

were advocating a kind of per se rule, that you construe the

19

statute that way.

20

construction in the court of appeals in their reply brief —

21

and they don't seem to press it in this particular — in this

22

court, so that the issue that Judge Silberman used as his

23

jumping off point for engaging in this Chevron discussion is

24

based on what petitioners have said so far, really not

25

presented in this particular case.

He though that they

The fact the petitioners disavowed that

1

And so I think the court before it starts talking

2

about Chevron — I think this is perhaps where Judge Silberman

3

made his mistake — first ought to identify the legal issue,

4

in fact, that requires that kind of treatment.

5

I would say the same thing about the canons of

6

construction.

The exceptions to the antitrust laws should be

7

narrowly construed.

8

resolving legal issues, questions of legal interpretation.

9

They're not sort of general standards of review that we apply

Canons of construction are used for

10

in — in cases involving questions of the application of law

11

to particular factual circumstances.

12

Just to go back very briefly to the Attorney

13

General's factual determinations, the four determinations that

14

the papers are losing money, the Free Press has no unilateral

15

way out, the News is unlikely to raise its prices, and the

16

paper's engaged in entirely proper activity.

17

It seems to me that if you accept those four factual

18

determinations — and under the two court rule I think the

19

court really has to accept those two factual determinations —

20

there can't be any really serious contention that this

21

decision was arbitrary and capricious.

22

findings, I think, establish really without any doubt, that

23

the Free Press has to be regarded as a failing newspaper.

2

considered what that language means, the Ninth Circuit

3

decision in the Hearst case, said that that should be

4

interested to mean that the newspaper is suffering losses

5

which more than likely cannot be reversed.

6

General specifically adopted that as his understanding of what

7

the statute means.

8

9

The only previous court to have

The Attorney

Well, if the Free Press has lost money for seven
years, if they have no way unilaterally to get out of the

10

situation, and if their arch rival, the News, is not going to

11

let them off the hook, it seems to me that you can't draw any

12

conclusion except that they are in a probable danger of

13

financial failure.

14

And with respect to policies and purposes, I think

15

the finding by the Attorney General that the newspapers had

16

engaged in entirely lawful, responsible competition really

17

defeats any claim that they — that the application should be

18

denied on policies and purposes grounds.

19

Obviously if the Free Press is going to fail, the

20

primary policy and purpose of the statute is to preserve

21

independent editorial voices, and that policy is clearly

22

fulfilled by granting the application in this case.

23

The Attorney General went beyond the — the one

24

policy and purpose that the statute mentions.

25

that it was — that the general considerations of competition

policy should be taken into account also, and I think that

also has been satisfied here by his finding because I think it

petitioners talk a lot about the importance of the policy of

Congress thought was more important than the policies of

economic competition.

trying to preserve two or more editorial voices, independent

editorial voices in communities that otherwise would be denied

That, of course, is the policy of

Congress heard a lot of evidence about the decline

And the record in this case indicates that if
anything, the trend has simply continued.

14

We now in this country have about 1,500 cities with

15

one newspaper owner and 25 cities with two or more newspapers

16

that are independently owned and competing.

17

And so, I think when the Attorney General was making

18

his decision, he was very cognizant of the fact that Congress'

19

primary concern here was to make sure that wherever possible -

20

- and there's not very many places where it's still possible -

MR. MERRILL:

Sad to say, Justice Scalia, but there

11

are a lot of cities in this country that could support two

12

newspapers, but that do not have two newspapers.

13

For example, since this Act was passed in 1970, its

support" meant that in full and fair competition, more than

21

one would survive.

22

MR. MERRILL:

No.

I thought "could

A "could support," I think, in

23

the petitioner's use of it means that if there was some kind

24

of pricing czar who was able to somehow intercede and

25

determine what the prices of these newspapers ought to be.

There are circulation prices and advertising prices, then they

2

could make money.

3

Unfortunately, there is no such thing in the

4

competition situation, where the two newspapers are

5

desperately trying to avoid the downward spiral; to avoid

6

having their circulation begin to slip, and have their

7

advertising revenue start to fall off and all of sudden, they

8

are out of the picture.

9

In that sort of situation, the competitive reality

10

is that the papers will not price at levels which are

11

sufficient for the two of them to last.

12

That was true, for example -- if Congress was aware

13

that in New York City, which is the biggest newspaper market

14

in the country, there had been quite a number of newspaper

15

failures, notwithstanding the fact that clearly that's not a

16

situation where there's not sufficient revenues to sustain at

17

some level pricing, more than one newspaper.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Merrill, in any of these other

19

markets, did the — when they got down to two and a then one

20

survived, was it the afternoon paper that survived at the

21

expense of the morning?

22

MR. MERRILL:

Isn't this somewhat unusual?
It is unusual, Justice Stevens.

In

23

Philadelphia, is the situation that both the news and the free

24

press were looking at over their shoulders.

25

In Philadelphia you had, at one time, a dominant

evening paper, The Bulletin, I think it was, and a struggling

2

morning paper.

3

The morning paper, incidentally, was owned by

4

Knight-Ridder.

5

around after six years of losses, and the Bulletin eventually

6

went into a tailspin and went out of business.

7

Knight-Ridder was able to turn that situation

So I think there were certain clear parallels

8

between Philadelphia and Detroit, that both these papers were

9

looking at throughout this period of time, and it explains, I

10

think, largely why they were competing the way they were in

11

order to try and maintain at all costs their market shares,

12

and that led to the losses that made them unprofitable.

13
14

If there are no further questions, I thank the
Court.

QUESTION:

16

Mr. Schultz, do you have a reubuttal?

Thank you, Mr. Merrill.
You have two

minutes.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM B. SCHULTZ

19

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

20

MR. SCHULTZ:

21

First of all, these various facts that the Attorney

22

General and Mr. Merrill have picked out of the record are all

23

rebutted by the 50-50 profit split.

24

the fact.that the newspapers themselves describe their equal

25

competitive positions and how they divided profits.

Yes.

Just three points, Your Honor.

They can't get away from

1

Second, on the issue of whether Detroit can support

2

two profitable newspapers, the Attorney General found this is

3

not a situation where one of these papers is failing because

4

it's on a downward spiral or losing advertising and

5

circulation.

6

typically accompany a failing newspaper.

7

He didn't find any of the situations that

He found that Detroit can support two profitable

8

newspapers if prices are at market, so that focuses the whole

9

case on the issue of price and nothing else.

10

And thirdly, the statute has an explicit requirement

11

that the Attorney General find that the joint operating

12

agreement is consistent with the policies of the Newspaper

13

Preservation Act.

14

many cases where you're arguing about the agency's policies

15

versus the Court's policies.

So this is not the situation of having so

16

Congress here identified what the policies are, and

17

they identified the policy of competition in all parts of the

18

United States, and the policy that they identified is

19

consistent with the canon of anti-trust law that requires that

20

exceptions being narrowly construed.

And if that canon is
«

21

applied, as the court of appeals held, then the Attorney

22

General's decision must be overturned.

23

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

25

Thank you, Mr. Schultz.

The case is submitted.
