ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. LAUFER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is before the court on a petition of

11

certiorari through a view of decision of the U.S. Court of

12

appeals for the Second Circuit.

13

interpretation of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil

14

Procedure and more, specifically, whether under Rule 11 a

15

district court is empowered to impose sanctions not only upon

16

the attorney who signs a paper or pleading that offends the

17

rule, but the district court -- whether the district court may

18

also impose sanctions upon the law firm or law partnership or

19

employer of such an attorney who has signed such a pleading.

At issue in this case is the

to the trial.

appropriate.

The district court found that while that claim

himself, and that was for the first half, this is after —

13

finally after a hearing on -- or an argument under Rule 60(b).

14

The Court found that during the first half of the litigation,

15

the signer basically stood alone, and, and imposed those

16

sanctions against him.

17

the approximate midpoint of the litigation, the signer of the

18

pleading had formed a firm, which is now the Petitioner before

19

this Court of Pavelic & LeFlore, and according -- accordingly

20

apportioned half of the sanctions, the latter half of the

21

sanctions, against both Mr. LeFlore, who had signed each of the

22

offending papers, insofar as attorneys are concerned, and

23

against his law firm, Pavelic & LeFlore.

its view of the purpose of Rule 11, that it was appropriate

2

that sanctions could be imposed by the district court,

3

presumptively it, it indicated, because that would, in the view

4

of the Second Circuit Court of appeals, promote the purpose of

5

Rule 11 in the sense, the court felt, that law firms and

6

employers would be motivated by this presumption that the

7

Second Circuit was creating to monitor more, more specifically

8

and with, with greater vigor the pleadings that were signed by

9

all of its attorneys.

10

And accordingly, the Court of appeals for the Second

11

Circuit created this rule, which we submit is without textural

foundation.

LeFlore, upon the Petitioner.

We claim that the district court did not have the

of Rule 11 since the very inception of Rule 11, when it was

first promulgated in 1938.

court decision in which there was a United States against

American Surety, where a, a signature appeared, a, a firm of

attorneys by so and so, a member of the firm, and there was

actually a motion to strike that motion.

11

Rule 11 as it was then created and as it now exists, I would

12

submit, Your Honors.

13

Following this requirement within the rule, that an

14

attorney in his individual name sign such a pleading, the, the

rule explains what that signature means.

certificate, a certificate being a written assurance, a written

17

representation by the signer of the pleading, that the signer

18

has read the pleading, that the signer warrants that the

19

pleading meets the factual and legal requirements that are set

20

out in the rule, meaning a factual, a factual inquiry that is

21

reasonable under all of the circumstances, a legal inquiry that

22

is reasonable under all of the circumstances.

23

further warrants that the, the pleading is not interposed for

24

any improper purpose and some of those purposes, improper

25

purposes, are articulated within the rule.

That rule is a

The signer

And then we come to the operative language of the

rule itself, and the operative language of the rule says that

3

upon finding a violation, if a violation is found, the district

court shall impose upon the person who signed it, that is the

5

person, the attorney of record in his individual name who has

6

signed it, who has given his address --

QUESTION:

Doesn't the signer also say that he is

authorized to put the name down?

MR. LAUFER:

I assume that that is implicit.

the signer has, is retained by a client.

MR. LAUFER:

2

QUESTION:

They are indeed.
And you don't think that the attorney

3

represents thereby that he represents, or she represents, that

4

law firm and is authorized to sign it on behalf, not only of

5

the attorney, but for the firm?

6

MR. LAUFER:

That is surely implicit within an

7

attorney's signature that, that -- that indicates that that

8

attorney is --

9

QUESTION:

So the rule could be interpreted, if you

10

followed ordinary agency principles, I suppose, to bring the

11

firm in as well.

12

MR. LAUFER:

Your Honor, I believe that that is not

13

so, because I believe, first, we have the language of the rule.

14

An attorney of record, at least one of attorney of record, in

15

his individual name, in that attorney's individual name.

17

rule.

18

Rule 11 of 1938 did not encompass an attorney and a party the

19

way this rule structurally and grammatically must encompass.

20

It encompassed an attorney.

21

warranted that he read it, that he was, was, was satisfied and

22

was making the certification to the court.

23

We

We see how we come by this

The antecedent of this rule is Rule 11 of 1938.

And

And it indicated that the attorney

The Advisory Committee's notes indicate that it was

24

the intention of the Advisory Committee that, that the rule

continue in its application to anyone who signs a pleading.

1

The test that the district courts are exhorted by the Advisory

2

Committee notes to, to use in ascertaining whether the tests of

3

the rule have been met deal with the signer's conduct, the

4

attorney who signed it, the person who signed it.
I believe that while it is indeed true that the law

5
6

firm is or are the attorneys for a particular party, that is

7

without question, but for purposes of the rule, that person who

8

was called to task, who makes a written assurance to the court,

9

a, a, a representation to the court for which that person is

10

sanctioned or punished, is one particular person.

11

There are references in the Advisory Committee notes

12

to other attorneys, but the only such reference has to do with

13

testing the signer's conduct, meaning whether or not the signer

14

— what the signer did was reasonable under the circumstances

15

may depend on whether that signed relied upon another member of

16

the bar.

17

So I would submit, Your Honor, that the rule does not

18

— does not give, give, give latitude to be interpreted, I

19

would submit, that the signature of the signer in his

20

individual name is the signature of a law firm.

21

not understand the rule under other circumstances.

22

frankly, if I might suggest, Your Honor, that that is not

23

terribly distinct perhaps even from the rule of this Court,

24

Rule 33.2, which, which requires that the counsel of record

25

before this Court be an individual member of the bar of this

Many such lawyers who are counsel of record before this Court

Rule 11.

10

interpretation, and indeed I would submit they militate

11

conclusively in favor of this interpretation that I am urging

12

upon this Court.

Confirmation, of course, is, is found I believe if we

go beyond the actual language of the rule itself, if we go to

17

makes a promise to the court and who is held accountable.

18

Again, the entire focus is

Under the earlier version of the rule, under Rule 11

19

of 1938, the accountability was in terms purely of a

20

disciplinary action.

indicate, there was some reluctance on the part of courts to,

to, to use disciplinary action.

Would it just

No, Your Honor, I believe that the

district court would most surely not be powerless.

I think

9

those two attorneys, those two hypothetical partners that Your

10

Honor has, has referred to, would be shocked to learn that the

11

district court's arm reaches far beyond Rule 11, that conduct

12

of that sort would be clearly, under any set of circumstances,

13

bad-faith conduct, and the district court can surely discipline

Stevens.
QUESTION:

Well, would you think the inherent power

3

of a court is defined by bad faith?

4

power of the court is to give an appropriate sanction in an

5

appropriate case, and that the only way to get an appropriate

6

sanction is to -- is to — is to impose it on the partnership.

7

What's -- I don't see how this is different than Justice

8

Kennedy's case.

9

MR. LAUFER:

I believe the inherent

Justice Stevens, in, in the Roadway

10

Express case, in my reading of it, I believe it is clear, at

11

least to me, from the language of, of this Court, that before a

12

court can, can invoke its inherent authorities to sanction, to

13

sanction an attorney, there must be a finding of conduct that

14

either constitutes or is tantamount to bad faith.

15

reading, and that is what the commentators have read, based

16

upon Roadway Express.

And it says that the court may impose a

sanction on the person who signed it.

And that is

QUESTION:

Could, could I ask -- let's assume we

agree with you, and the sanction is limited to being imposed on

the person who signed the -- under state law could the sanction

be collected from the partnership?

I would submit that it could not.

would contend —

QUESTION:

Because of the rule or because of state

law?

the liability of the partnership for the obligations of one of

its partners?

MR. LAUFER:

I believe that's so, and I believe it

may do that in several different ways, if I may, Your Honor.

believe a sanction is a punishment, if I may respond.

sanction is a punishment.

some sanction, is deserving of some punishment.

the district court's discretion to say that -- what that

punishment is to be, whether it be a disciplinary referral to a

imposition of a monetary fine or an order to pay the other

that the party who is entitled to recover this award is

attorneys.

QUESTION:

MR. LAUFER:

12

And — but then the -- then the resort is

I would think that in a circumstance

13

where the signing attorney is judgment proof, I would wonder

14

whether this is an appropriate sanction.

15

whether a sanction that is illusory, in the sense o, off

something that could not have an impact upon the person who

wonder whether in the circumstances that is an appropriate

wrong doing that the partner has done or is determined to have

done, in that sort of a circumstance the, the state goal, the

4

operation of, of the rules of partnership are, are calculated

5

to make whole, to make whole the person who has been harmed.

6

That is the focus.
The focus of Rule 11, as the Advisory Committee notes

indicate and as the language of the rule really indicates to

9

me, the focus of Rule 11 is to punish and to deter, and, and,

and —
QUESTION:

But there is nothing in the rule that says

12

it is a punishment or that is punitive, and in fact, the

sanction is an objective one.

14

whether or not the sanction should be imposed is objective.

I suppose no one would suggest that if an

Your Honor, the problem -- the problem

14

that the rule was calculated to address, if one looks at the

15

Advisory Committee notes, is the problem of frivolous

16

pleadings, is the problem of dilatory practices and the like.

17

The, the — as a result of that certain, certain functional

18

changes were, were inserted into the rule, among them this

19

objective test.

20

But they were sanctions to begin with.

The

21

punishment under the old rule was a disciplinary action.

22

punishment under the new rule is a sanction.

23

Committee notes indicate that among the means that the Advisory

24

Committee has used in order to promote the goal of the rule,

25

which is deterrence and not fee shifting, was an, an

that in its view, given general traditional partnership

principles, in the ordinary circumstance, an attorney who is a

MR. ARNOFF:

3

You should come out differently for the

partnership.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. ARNOFF:

Why?
Because the, the prime purpose of the

rule is deterrence.

7

If the partnership can show that they had an internal

8

monitoring system and they did their job, and they supervise,

9

and they could not by reasonable means have discovered this,

10

then the rule, which is basically an equitable rule, should

relieve the partnership.

It — a secondary purpose is compensation.

Although it wouldn't relieve the

individual, even if he came forward and showed I had a

But what I am saying in this particular case, assume

2

that there was a violation.

3

this case was, traditional partnership principles should apply.

4

But if the, the partnership came back, as they did not do in

5

this case, and showed there were exceptional circumstances,

6

showed they weren't — that there — that there was concealment

7

or fraud, showed that they had a monitoring system, equitably,

8

they should not have to incur a sanction.

9

In the ordinary typical case, as

We do not believe that the Second Circuit legislated,

10

nor did they exercise in a raw fashion, the inherent power of

11

the court which has always been a power to regulate attorneys

12

who practice before it and to discipline attorneys.

13

power, I presume, was carried over by the enabling act in Rules

14

1, 7 and 11, and through the amendment of, of Rule 11, and

15

through a new definition of bad faith on objective terms.

16

it was appropriate in this particular case because the

17

partnership was a knowing participant in the law suit.

18

lawyers appeared, attended depositions, attended trial days.

19

Checks were written by Mr. Pavelic to satisfy discovery

20

sanctions that were incurred by the firm long before trial.

21

This was a major litigation and, of course, the linchpin charge

22

of this litigation, the forgery allegation against Peter

23

Shukat, was a conspicuous and not an incomprehensible

24

allegation that the partnership had to be aware of, and that

this was sustaining the life of the litigation.
