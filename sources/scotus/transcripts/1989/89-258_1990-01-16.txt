ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. HORN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This case presents the question whether Section

12

16 of the Clayton Act prohibits a district court from

13

decreeing divestiture of a supermarket chain in California

14

acquired in violation of the Clayton Act.

15

arises from the attempt of the American Stores Company,

16

the parent to Alpha Beta, the fourth largest supermarket

17

chain in California, to acquire Lucky Stores, Inc., the

18

largest supermarket chain in California, the acknowledged

19

low-price leader, for the purpose of merging those two

20

supermarket chains into one dominant firm controlling 25

21

percent of every consumer grocery dollar spent by

22

California consumers.

23

The issue

The district court below found that that merger

24

almost certainly violates Section 7 of the Clayton Act.

25

The district court found that that merger almost certainly

threatens irreparable harm to California consumers in the

2

form of several hundred million dollars per year in —

3

higher grocery bills that the California customers will

4

pay if this merger is allowed to be completed.

5

district court therefore entered a preliminary injunction

6

which it found necessary to preserve the remedy of

7

divestiture and other possible relief to prevent that harm

8

from occurring if it found, following a trial, that indeed

9

this merger does violate Section 7 of the act.

15

Act was designed to prevent.

17

showing justifying preliminary injunctive relief on the

18

record before it, which is the record before this Court.

It affirmed the

And it affirmed the district

But, the court of appeals held, based on its

20

prior decision in ITT, that the preliminary injunction was

21

overly broad, solely because the remedy of divestiture is

22

not available, a conclusion it reached based not on the

23

language of the statute, based not on the overriding

24

purpose of Section 16 of the act and based on none of the

25

policies underlying the substantive provisions under the

1

act.

2

fragment of the legislative history which was — it was

3

presented with, that Congress did not intend solely to

4

provide the divestiture remedy to private litigants.

5

Rather, the Ninth Circuit concluded, based on a

We think the Ninth Circuit's approach

6

fundamentally misinterprets the approach prescribed by

7

this Court in cases like Porter v. Warner Holding.

8

inquiry ought not to be did Congress intend to prohibit a

9

particular form of relief.

The

The question is, by granting

10

the injunctive powers for the courts to remedy antitrust

11

violations, is there a clear and valid command by the

12

Congress to preclude that relief.

13

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Horn, I guess the argument

14

made by the other side in part is that at the time

15

Congress considered this question and adopted the statute

16

we are asked to examine, that there was generally regarded

17

that there was a distinction between prohibitory

18

injunctive relief and injunctive relief that required

19

mandatory action, the so-called affirmative injunction.

20

And their argument is that Congress had in mind only

21

providing prohibitory injunctive relief.

22

Now, how do you respond to that argument?

23

MR. HORN:

We agree with American Stores that in

24

1914 the distinction between prohibitory and mandatory

25

injunctive relief was well understood by the Congress.

And if Congress had intended to limit private litigants to
prohibitory injunctive relief it would have said so
clearly in the statute.

That is not what it did.

It

provided the full scope of the injunctive relief to
prevent — to prevent threatened loss or damage by a
violation of the antitrust laws.

That is a long way from

incorporating a distinction between prohibitory and
mandatory injunctive relief.
And, by the way, the Ninth Circuit did not
ground its decision on that distinction.

That is American

Stores' argument to support the Ninth Circuit rule.

The -

- that distinction is not supportable by the language of
Section 16.

I think —

QUESTION:

Now, Mr. Horn, the — the order here

was one to hold and operate the stores separately, in
effect.

Now, that is some kind of divestiture order in

your view?
MR. HORN:

Well, we don't think so.

We think

this is — the order that was crafted by the district
court is a straightforward prohibitory preliminary
injunction maintaining the status quo and preserving the
possibility of all available remedies following a trial.
The Ninth Circuit —
QUESTION:

But that order has no purpose unless

the court has the power to order divesture.

I — surely

1

you acknowledge that that — that that order is beyond the

2

proper discretion of the court if the court cannot order

3

divestiture.

4

everything comes out a certain way, the court will order

divestiture.

Right?

MR. HORN:

I mean it — it assumes that if

It does preserve the divestiture.

I

mean, we don't dispute that.

8

QUESTION:

And has no other purpose.

9

MR. HORN:

I disagree.

The district court could

order, following a trial, a permanent hold separate of

11

these two supermarket chains.

12

injunction which would fall squarely within even American

13

Stores' reading of Section 16.

14

only, would order the American Stores to operate its firms

15

independently of one another, and, for the reasons that we

16

argued in the district court, while we don't believe that

17

that is complete relief, we don't believe that that would

18

be effective relief, it would nonetheless have the

19

tendency over the long run to provide some relief from the

20

injury threatened by this merger.

21

QUESTION:

That is a permanent

It would be prohibitory

But the question you raised in your

22

certiorari petition is whether divestiture is within the

23

provision for injunctive relief in Clayton Act Section 16.

that one of the purposes of the district court's

2

preliminary injunction was to preserve the divestiture

remedy, and we believe that the divestiture remedy falls

squarely within the authorizing language of Section 16 of

the Clayton Act.

And I would like to turn to that.

QUESTION:

Do we know that that was one of the

things that the district court had in mind?
MR. HORN:

I think we can fairly assume that

because of the district court's discussion of the effect

10

of the Federal Trade Commission's hold separate order from

11

its tentative consent agreement and final approval,

12

because Judge Kenyon said in his opinion that he was — it

13

would be a matter of verbal calisthenics to call this a

14

completed merger which could not be prevented by effective

15

injunctive relief at the permanent injunction stage

16

following trial.

17

he had the power to order the sale of the acquired firm if

18

he felt, at the conclusion of a trial, that that was

19

necessarily effective relief.

QUESTION:

And it seems clear to me that he thought

Let me, before you leave this

21

preliminary point, you did preserve a second question in

23

24

be sustained.

25

whether the court of appeals erred by reversing the

preliminary injunction and so forth and so on, which, it

2

seems to me the question whether the whole separate order

3

itself would be a valid form of relief, even if you could

4

not get divestiture, is still before us.
MR. HORN:

5

I think that is right.

The question

6

of whether a permanent injunction ordering the permanent

7

holding separate of these two firms by American Stores

8

would be an available remedy following trial is one of the

issues we presented — is still before you, and we believe

QUESTION:

11

We — you petitioned on two

12

questions, but I had thought we only granted on the first

question.

14

in your brief on the merits is divestiture being a form of

15

injunctive relief.

16

Am I wrong on that?

QUESTION:

Don't you think you should have done

that in your first brief, just out of courtesy to the

5

respondents so they could have had a shot at it, too?

mean if, you know, if you were going to convert this into

— into an argument over a permanent hold separate, I

would have liked to hear what the respondents had to say

MR. HORN:

Well, I think, Your Honor, that it's

20

— that it is also an issue which is fairly subsumed even

21

with the divestiture issue which we did discuss, because

22

the Ninth Circuit, in its opinion in this case, concluded

23

that even the preliminary injunction mandating a temporary

is subsumed is not to say it need not be argued.

2

MR. HORN:

Well, I think all of the principles

3

which we will — which we did argue and are arguing today,

4

that divestiture is available or applicable to the

5

indivestiture portion of the Ninth Circuit's holding below

6

and in ITT.

7

Turning to the language of Section 16, Congress

8

provided to private citizens and the states the right to

9

secure injunctive relief against threatened loss or damage

10

by a violation of the antitrust laws.

11

language is clear and that each of the three elements is

12

plainly present in this case.

13

We believe this

First, California sought in its complaint and

14

the district court found that divestiture might be

15

necessary to remedy the harm threatened by this merger.

16

Secondly, California showed and the district court found

17

that divestiture was a form of injunctive relief within

18

the meaning of Section 16 that would prevent the very

19

threatened loss that Section 7 was designed to prevent.

20

And third, California showed and the court found that the

21

injury threatened by this merger was that — that this

22

merger was a violation to antitrust laws and threatened

23

the precise injury which Section 7 was designed to

24

prevent.

referred to by Justice O'Connor, it is especially

And

10

there is not a hint in the language or the history of

11

Section 16 that Congress intended to limit that statute to

12

only future violations of one of the substantive

13

provisions.

14

QUESTION:

Well, they argue that the language of

15

the statute, of course, is that the relief can be obtained

against threatened loss or damages.

MR. HORN:

That is correct, Justice O'Connor.

18

QUESTION:

Which could be interpreted as looking

19

to the future.

20

MR. HORN:

Clearly it does look to the future,

21

because it is the future injury, but it is not limited to

22

injury which flows only from future acts or from future

23

violations, which is the next step of American Stores'

24

argument.

That is important because in 1914 there was no

Act by which private litigants would learn in advance that

Private litigants would only learn about

effect, long after the stock had been purchased.
And Congress could not have intended to provide

11

12

a remedy which would be wholly superfluous to the very

13

provision of the Section 7 that it was asking Section —

14

private litigants to enforce.

15

the statute does focus on the threatened injury that

16

individuals face from completed violations, or

17

irrespective of whether the violation is complete or not.

18

QUESTION:

A more natural reading of

One of the arguments that the

19

respondents make is that Section 15, giving authority to

20

the Federal Government, is cast in different and they say

21

broader language than Section 16.

to that?

23

MR. HORN:

What is your response

My first response is that it is not

24

broader language.

2

language which lends itself readily to the suggestion that

3

it is directed only at future violations.

4

years this Court has recognized that that statute

authorizes the government to seek, and the district courts

to order, the relief directed at completed violations and

affirmative structural relief.

QUESTION:

Section —

So your suggestion is that — what

•was Congress' purpose in putting the authority of the

10

Federal Government in different language than that of the

11

private people?

12

MR. HORN:

The principal reason for it is

13

because Section 16, by conferring a private remedy, needed

14

to import a standing limit, and that is why we have

15

threatened injury.

16

government has never been required to show for it, to

17

establish its rights to secure relief against antitrust

18

violations.

It is a standing limit which the

Now, I would like to turn briefly, if I may, to

20

the legislative history of the Clayton Act, since that is

21

where the Ninth Circuit and American Stores' grounds what

22

I think is the heart of its argument in this case.

23

know that Congress, in 1914, knew that Section 15 of the

relief, and specifically the remedy of dissolution.
And we also know, by careful reading of the

3

debates on the final conference bill in both the Senate

4

and the House in 1914, that those two bodies were told by

5

the floor managers of this bill that it provided the very

6

same remedies under Section 16 that the Congress was

7

providing to the government in Section 15.

8

Representative Webb in the House told the House in the

9

final conference debate that this bill was as strong in

We know that

10

civil remedies as it could be made.

And it seems to us

11

that that cannot be true if the most effective remedy for

12

violations of Section 7 was not being provided.

13

it is clear from those debates on the conference bill that

14

the full scope of the injunctive powers of the courts was

conferred on the courts by Section 16.

as Laches, clean hands and the rest, would be

extraordinarily difficult in that case.

3

QUESTION:

Well, it's a monopolized market.

4

mean, it turns out that in fact there is not as much

5

competition as there might have been had that merger not

6

occurred 20 years ago.

7

MR. HORN:

Well, if the specific individual

8

bringing that suit 20 years later could show that he first

9

began to feel the effects of the behavior that that merger

10

conferred on the offending firm, then I think he would be

11

entitled to bring the case at that time.

12

could only show that he had begun to feel the effects 20

13

years ago, and sat on his rights for 20 years, then I

14

think he is going to have a difficult case indeed.

15

that does not go to the availability of a cause of action.

applied by courts to address it.

statute directs district courts to prevent injury caused

should be read to give the district courts power to unwind

8

way to prevent injury.

But Section 16 has commanded the

injury which flows from violations, and it matters not

whether they are completed, past, ongoing or threatened.

So, in light of your answer that the

13

period of time that elapses is irrelevant, I take it then

it is unimportant, other than for the way it may bear on

MR. HORN:

I think it is unimportant to the

specific question whether a district court has the power

to decree divestiture.

the Court decides to, which we oppose, but if the Court

proposed distinction between the availability of

14

impact on enforcement of all the substantive provisions of

MR. LEE:

12
13

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
First, just very briefly with respect to what

14

issue is before this Court, I think that the second

15

question presented, fairly read, does not include anything

16

other than what the second question presented says, which

17

is whether a preliminary injunction preserving the

18

possibility of divestiture is authorized by Section 16.

19

It says nothing about any hold separate agreement.

The

4

20

brief appears to acknowledge the correctness of the Ninth

21

Circuit's ruling on that aspect of the case.

22

Justice Scalia, it is in footnote 1, and the way it is

23

raised is, was this final under Delaware law.

24

there is anything on which this Court did not grant

And then,

And if

Now, the case really boils down to a simple

2

3

matter of statutory interpretation.

The petitioner is

4

quite right in this respect.

5

expanded the package of remedies available to private

plaintiffs to include equitable relief.

7

respect their relief is the same as that of the Federal

8

Government.

remedies were to be identical to those of the Federal

And in that

But the further proposition, that private

10

Government, is rejected by the statute on its face and by

11

every rule of statutory interpretation that is applicable

12

here.

13

then why two separate sections?

14

in each of the sections?

15

is that the government must — doesn't need to show any

16

injury, and that is just flat wrong.

that is undeniable is that in Section 16 Congress referred

-

2

to threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage.

3

Now, the only answer, the only answer that the

4

petitioner has to that language is that what they really

5

meant to do by that provision was to incorporate the

familiar — requirement of the familiar restriction that

you have to show that you are going to suffer injury that

QUESTION:

3

Well, Mr. Lee, in your view the

acquisition of control that would amount to an antitrust

violation of another company, if it has been completed,

could never be attacked in court by a private plaintiff or

by the state acting under the same statute, if it has

already occurred.
MR. LEE:

10

That is correct.
And, of course, most of these things

11

are handled before the state or a private person would

know it is going to take place.

that remedy all together.

And then Mr. Carlin said to Mr. Brandeis it has

been suggested to us that we ought to give the individual

10

the right to file a bill in equity for the dissolution of

11

one of these combinations, the same right which the

12

government now has.

13

Brandeis:

14

status, which is the right of dissolution, is a right

15

which ought to be exercised only by the government,

16

although the right for full redress against future wrongs

17

is a right which every individual ought to enjoy."

18

Now, a couple or three points.

And here was the response by Mr.

"It seems to me that the right to change the

19

statement, like Judge Hand's, shows, in answer to Justice

20

O'Connor's question, that the word that they used in those

it is a fair reading of the language, because the language

17

you do not have behind it the kind of legislative history

18

that you have here.

19

Again, I repeat, it was a debate that raged, it

20

was an intense debate.

that was used was grinding the poor defendant between the

In response to several questions from
