CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RALPH S. TYLER, III

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 88-1182
MR. TYLER:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case presents two questions.

12

First,

13

whether a court order directing a parent to produce her

14

child compels incriminating testimony in violation of the

15

Fifth Amendment and, secondly, whether in this case the

16

mother's privilege claim is overcome by the important

17

societal interest in protecting a child plainly at risk.
I will address the first of these issues and the

18
19

child's counsel will address the second.
The child who is the subject of this case was

20
21

born in October 1986.

As of four months of age he had

22

been hospitalized twice with confirmed fractures of major

23

bones.

24

observed shaking him and dropping him into his crib while

25

he was in a cast.

During his second hospitalization his mother was

The Baltimore City Department of Social Services

2

filed a petition with the juvenile court in Baltimore

3

asserting that Maurice was a child in need of assistance,

4

as defined by Maryland law.

5

A court hearing was held on that petition at

6

which all parties were represented by counsel and the

7

parties stipulated to the facts of the petition.

8

was placed in foster care, where he remained for some

9

months when the order was modified to return physical

10

custody to the mother.

11

QUESTION:

"Poor Joshua" case, isn't it?

13

MR. TYLER:

14

Maurice

Why was that done?

This is another

It certainly has absolutely the same

tragic facts, Your Honor.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. TYLER:

Can you defend that action?
I think — certainly with benefit of

17

hindsight it was a great error to return the child.

18

record reflects that the agency opposed that before the

19

Master, but did not take an appeal.

20
21

QUESTION:

Why do we need hindsight?

apparent at the time?

22

MR. TYLER:

23

answer no, it wasn't apparent.

24

the court concurred that the child should be returned.

parties, again all represented by counsel, agreed to an

2

order of protective supervision finding Maurice to be a

3

child in need of supervision under the supervision of the

4

Department of Social Services and the mother had physical

5

custody.
Importantly, that order provided, among other

things, that the mother was required to cooperate with the

Department.

order.

10

She, represented by counsel, agreed to that

Agency personnel have last seen this child in

11

December — in September of 1987.

12

making repeated efforts to locate the child, the Agency

13

filed a petition in the juvenile court in Baltimore

14

seeking a review of the court order and ordered a show of

15

cause and a petition for contempt.

16

In April of '88, after

After arrest, the mother, with counsel at her

17

side, told the juvenile court that the child was with the

18

mother's sister in Dallas.

19

she gave other information as to the child's whereabouts,

20

which similarly proved to be false.

21

This proved to be false and

The court held her in contempt and sent her to

22

jail providing that she could purge herself of contempt by

23

either producing the child before the court or revealing

24

his exact whereabouts.

QUESTION:

Where is she now?

QUESTION:

Mr. Tyler, does — would the act of

production of the child be a testimonial statement of some

5

kind?

6

MR. TYLER:

7

QUESTION:

Not in our view, Your Honor.

The —

Well, in cases where orders have been

8

entered to require turning over some kind of paper, this

9

Court has indicated in its opinions that to do so has

10

testimonial aspects.

11

have some testimonial aspects as to her possession or

12

control, or something of that sort?

13

MR. TYLER:

Why wouldn't turning over the child

Because, Justice O'Connor, in the

14

cases where the Court has said that there would be

15

testimonial content to an act of production, the

16

identified variables have been existence, possession,

17

authentication.

18

conclusions or not in dispute, which we submit is this

19

case, then the act of production has no testimonial

effect.

And if those .items are foregone

Well, is that strictly speaking true?

You don't know where the child is.

assume the state would want to use the testimonial aspects

if it were ever to file criminal proceedings against her.

It is, of course, true that we do

custody of the child.

QUESTION:

MR. TYLER:

conceded — correct me if I'm wrong, perhaps she has —

that she now has physical custody of the child.

take it, that she had physical custody of the child the

15

day before she went before the court.

MR. TYLER:

She

Well, what she — what she did

17

concede, Justice Kennedy, at the hearings in the juvenile

18

court in April of '88 is, first, her counsel on her behalf

basis for concern.

2

there has been an intervening custodial relationship which

3

somehow relieved her of her undisputed custody.

4

QUESTION:

Rather —

Well, certainly there may not be any

question about her legal custody.

physical possession and control would seem to me to be

testimonial aspects of compliance with the production.

MR. TYLER:

QUESTION:

10

But the fact of

Well -I just don't understand why it

wouldn't be.

11

MR. TYLER:

Well, it wouldn't be in our view,

12

Justice O'Connor, because this is the only living parent

13

of a child who at the time the case was in the juvenile

14

court was 19 months old.

15

state can look to and, indeed, she has pointed us to no

16

one else.

exception.

20

There is no one else that the

It seems to me, to make it even more

Let me ask you this.

Would you have any

21

objection to giving use immunity?

22

immunity is available under Maryland law.

23

MR. TYLER:

I understand use

Your Honor, the status of immunity

24

under Maryland law has changed dramatically while this

case has been pending and as of April — as of July of '89

there is a broader immunity statute in Maryland.
QUESTION:

But —

Well, wouldn't use immunity suffice

3

for your concerns and the concerns of — of others in this

4

very important case?

5

then you can have no objection to use immunity.

6

MR. TYLER:

If you say it's not testimonial,

that she has asserted a Fifth Amendment privilege which we

claim does not exist.

12

that that is this case.

13

QUESTION:

It is our view

Well, if we thought she did, is

14

Maryland now in a position to grant limited use immunity

15

for the testimonial aspects of the compliance with the

16

production order?

Yes.

As a matter of law, that would

laser-like limited immunity so that just the testimonial

prevails entirely in this Court as would any person who

2

was asked to perform an act if it is not protected by the

3

Fifth Amendment.

4

The state should not be required to provide

5

immunity because, for example, as the court noted in

6

Braswell, there are costs to doing so.

7

granting immunity should be considered and the state

8

should not be required to grant it until she absolutely

9

prevails here.

10

The costs of

But the state's position, we believe, is

11

supported really by two lines of authority in this court.

12

First, the Schmerber line of authority and then the Fisher

13

and act of production cases.

14

The Schmerber line certainly established that

15

the general rule is that the Fifth Amendment does not

16

relieve a person of the obligation to produce

17

incriminating evidence.

18

in the decision below, and a flaw which is largely

19

conceded in the brief of the Respondent, is to put all the

20

weight in the case on the potential incrimination of

21

producing the child when in fact that is only half the

22

test and that we do not dispute that it may have some

23

incriminating effect.

And we submit that the great flaw

than a person is relieved of the obligation to provide a

And that, in our view, is a dangerous and

12

unwarranted extension of the Fifth Amendment privilege.

13

To hold as a matter of federal constitutional law that a

14

parent cannot be required to produce her child in court

15

because to do so would constitute testimony, would

16

ultimately remove from the juvenile court the single most

17

important power it must have, and that is the minimal

18

power to require a parent to bring her child before the

19

court so that the court can satisfy itself

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MITCHELL Y. MIRVISS

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 88-6651

4
5
6

MR. MIRVISSi

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The second question in this case considers

7

whether the important societal interest in protecting

8

children at risk of serious injury can overcome the

9

privilege against self-incrimination.

10
11

At two levels, this

issue has extreme ramifications.
First, this Court must decide whether the needs

12

of my client, an infant who is defenseless, who has been

13

previously abused and whose whereabouts have been unknown

14

for the past 18 months, must be abandoned in favor of an

15

unprecedented extension of the — of the Fifth Amendment.

16

Second, if this Court decides against Maurice,

17

family courts and juvenile courts across the country will

18

lose their parens patriae authority to protect

19

upon thousands of children from serious abuse.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

thousands

Well, why is that so if limited use

immunity is available for just the act of production?
MR. MIRVISS:

Your Honor, limited use immunity

23

is available only upon the consent or the request of the

24

state's attorney.

1

discretion whether his or her law enforcement interests

2

outweigh the needs of the juvenile court.

3

The juvenile court does not have the power to

4

confer use immunity nor did any of the other parties in

5

the juvenile court proceeding.

6

where use immunity may not be available, that solution —

7

would not assist the juvenile court at all.

8
9
10

Similarly, in other states

In this particular case, however, limited use
immunity would satisfy the need for Maurice's production,
but it is a speculative assumption.

11

And if we look at the availability of immunity

12

for every conflict which arises between civil regulatory

13

systems and potential incriminations, then the entire line

14

of cases of this court, dating from United States v.

15

Sullivan in the income tax reporting system through

16

wartime price regulation in Shapiro v. United States, on

17

through deterrence of drunk driving and traffic accident

18

reporting in Byers v. California, would automatically fall

19

out.

20

Immunity is not the answer that this Court has

21

held to those fundamental clashes between civil regulation

22

and potential incriminating disclosures.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Mirviss, straighten me out on one

24

thing.

Had she not given assurance that the child would

25

be produced to the court?

MR. MIRVISS:

1

Justice Blackmun, the mother,

2

through her counsel, informed the court that the child

3

would be produced and that the mother was on her way.

4

Unfortunately, the mother never appeared in court and the

5

mother never produced the child.

MR. MIRVISS:

QUESTION:

MR. MIRVISS:

But counsel gave that assurance?
That is correct, Your Honor.

Her counsel?
Her counsel.

In the view of the

10

court below, the mother was lying to the court and to her

11

counsel.

12

Your Honor, the impact of this case is dramatic.

13

In every state juvenile courts would lose the power to

14

compel parents who are suspected of maltreating their

15

children to bring their children to court.

16

suspicion would be enough to block the juvenile court's

17

inherent or statutory powers.

MR. MIRVISS:

No, Your Honor, they were not

QUESTION:

But just to conclude the point,

15

you're saying that there are scores, hundreds, many cases

in which courts today routinely issue subpoenas to parents

Ms. Bouknight has alternatives available to her

which she has not chosen to exercise.

MR. MIRVISS:

Yes, Your Honor.

This case

17

squarely falls within California v. Byers.

18

the court upheld a less vital state interest, the

19

adjudication of civil property damage claims against

20

appreciably stronger Fifth Amendment interests.

21

In that case,

Byers held that neutral noncriminal statutes can

compel incriminating information if they are part of a

civil regulatory system which in no way targets criminal

activity.

joined that opinion to create a majority by establishing a

2

balancing test when valid civil governmental interests are

asserted against possible Fifth Amendment incrimination.

4

Justice Harlan phrased the balance test by looking at the

nature of the governmental interest, the nature of the

type — or the type of incrimination which would incur,

7

and, finally, the necessity for the information which

would be produced.

Here it's only the person whose

could prompt this juvenile court to exercise its statutory

authority are not limited to instances of extreme abuse.

They could extend to the whole host of issues which the

18

the death of an individual — if there's no other way to

19

prevent that other than to punish the person who doesn't

give you the information to prevent it, that's too bad;

21

you must let the harm occur.

MR. BURNS:

We're going to hold him civil contempt until he files it

because we're very interested in him filing an income tax

So, the state's using the option — in fact, in

we really don't have much need of criminal laws.

Well, let me ask you, while we're

I take it — or, correct me if

14

you disagree — that in a case where the court awards

custody to a mother but with a warning that the mother is

to cooperate with social service workers, I take it the

court could require a waiver of the Fifth Amendment as a

condition to remitting the child to the custody of the —

MR. BURNS:

My view, Justice Kennedy, is,

assuming all the proper forms going through, the answer

22

would be yes.

23

think that's certainly another.

it in retrospect, but certainly in future cases that's a

25

perfectly reasonable explanation.

There wasn't anything in this case.

you have the lawyer, and you simply make it clear that you

2

can't use the Fifth Amendment for this limited thing, for

3

producing the baby.

So, although I don't know of a case where that's

5

actually happened, I haven't seen any, I see in principle

6

no reason why it isn't a perfectly suitable basis for

avoiding all of these problems.

Oh, but wait a minute on that.

Of course, Mr. Chief Justice, I

in a vacuum because, as I pointed out, I don't know of any

pages 74 of the Joint Appendix, where the judge talks

about, in reference to one of your earlier questions —

that he requires there be verification of whatever the

Is that — again, are you saying the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RALPH S. TYLER, III

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 88-1182

16

MR. TYLER:

Without any doubt, the interests in

17

this case are the most fundamental and important interests

18

that the state has to protect and that we as a people have

19

to protect, and none of the arguments advanced today or in

20

the brief or in the opinion of the Court of Appeals of

21

Maryland meet either half of this case.

22

With respect to the testimonial issue, on page

23

10 of Respondent's brief they say this case need not be

24

decided on the narrow ground of whether the effect of

25

producing the child is testimonial.
