ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. WINTERHALTER:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
Good afternoon.

The third case before the Court

12

today involves whether a debtor's pre-bankruptcy payment

13

alone from its general operating account for trust fund

14

tax obligations excludes that property from a bankruptcy

15

estate subject to avoidance as preferential transfers

16

under Section 547.

17

to this Court, I would respectfully present that such

18

transfers are, in fact, avoidable.

19

For the reasons which I shall present

The Petitioner in this case is the court-

20

appointed Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee in the matter of

21

American International Airways.

22

commercial airline carrier that provided scheduled

23

passenger and air cargo service throughout the eastern and

24

central United States.

The debtor was a

was required to pay wages to those employees and was

2

further required to withhold taxes from those employees'

3

wages, was required to withhold individual income taxes,

4

the employer's — the employee's share of Federal

5

Insurance Corporation taxes, and was further required to

6

retain certain excise taxes which it collected from the

7

passengers' tickets.

9

By the first quarter of 1984, the debtor had
become — had experienced financial difficulties in the

10

payments of its — of its debt — of its debts.

11

to many companies in this type of situation, the debtor

12

failed to file and pay its tax returns on a timely basis.

13

The debtor funded only net payroll.

15

enforcement of the collect — for the enforcement of these

The debtor followed these guidelines and on

21

April 30th transferred two checks to the government, one

out of the specially designated account and the second

operating account.

Two further payments were made out of the

2

general operating account just prior to the bankruptcy.

One for $200,000, which was applied to 941 withholding

taxes and the second in the amount of $11,636 which was

applied to Federal unemployment taxes and also to Form 11

taxes for the year 1982.

QUESTION:

All the payments you've described,

Mr. Winterhalter, were within the preferential period?
MR. WINTERHALTER:

That is correct, Your Honor.

10

The debtor's financial difficulties continued, whereby on

11

July 19th, 1984, the debtor filed its petition under

12

Chapter 11.

13

appointed two months later.

14

Problems persisted and a trustee was

During the administration of the bankruptcy

15

proceeding, the trustee instituted this instant action,

16

seeking to avoid the three transfers made out of the

17

debtor's general operating account.

Following a trial, the bankruptcy court ruled

19

that the trustee was entitled to avoid

District of Columbia, found the ability of the debtor to

2

make the pre-petition payment of withholding taxes

3

regardless of the source of those funds impressed those

funds with trust characteristics, removing the property

from the debtor's estate.
QUESTION:

of appeals talking about?
MR. WINTERHALTER:

9

What particular funds was the court

Your Honor, I'm not certain I
The funds — the funds which

10

the court of appeals was discussing were the funds that

11

the debtor used to pay the Internal Revenue Service.
QUESTION:

12

13

Simply money drawn on its general

operating account?

14

MR. WINTERHALTER:

That is correct.

They were

15

written on a regular check that the — that the debtor

16

would pay any other creditor.

17

It is respectfully presented that the holding of

18

the Third Circuit is incorrect and should be reversed.

19

The circuit's reasoning is wrong on four specific points.
First, the court relies on the wrong legislative

20

21

history to support its contention that Congress intended

22

to preclude the avoidability of tax withholding payments.
QUESTION:

23
24
25

Well, what about the language of the

statute?
MR. WINTERHALTER:

My second point would be that

the clear language of the statute —
QUESTION:

Well, you had better start with that,

hadn't you?

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. WINTERHALTER:

I would believe, Your Honor,

6

that the clear language — the plain wording of the

7

statute expressly requires that for this trust to be

created the taxes must be withheld or collected.

11

doesn't the law say that these withheld taxes are to be

MR. WINTERHALTER:

Yes, it does.

It says, the amount of tax so collected or

withheld shall be held to be a special fund .in trust.

3

MR. WINTERHALTER:

4

QUESTION:

That —

It — it provides automatically•by

statute that whatever amount is withheld for these taxes

6

is automatically in trust for the government.

7

what it says?

10

MR. WINTERHALTER:
that, Justice O'Connor.
QUESTION:

Isn't that

The statute says expressly

I would represent --

So why does it have to be segregated

11

to comply with the statute?

12

MR. WINTERHALTER:

I would represent to the

13

Court, as has this Court on other occasions, that there

14

must be a trust raised for a trust to be established.

15

There must be something there.

16

suggests that they need do nothing, that payment alone is

17

a sufficient designation to establish this trust.

18

there is no trust existence.

QUESTION:

If -- here the government

You're — you're not now saying that

it has to be segregated.

to exist, that when somebody pays an employee $80 and

22

fails to withhold the $10 or put that aside for the

23

government, there — there is no $10 to — for the trust

24

to attach to.

25

You're just saying that it has

MR. WINTERHALTER:

QUESTION:

The property is —

-- there's nothing to identify.
That is correct.

You just paid him — paid him 80.

13

You were supposed to put 10 aside, but there is no 10 that

14

we know of that's an identifiable 10.

15

QUESTION:

16

though, because they paid him.

17

19

Well, obviously there was money

MR. WINTERHALTER:

Yes, there is money.

But

there is no —
QUESTION:

Well, whatever the law says — that

— that amount is going be held in trust, and the money

was there to be held in trust.

1

that second clause of 7501 that Justice O'Connor referred

2

to.

3

held to be a special fund in trust for the United States.

4

Now, certainly Congress can legislate in a way that says a

5

-- a particular fund shall be treated in a particular way

6

even though under the classic law of trusts there might

7

not be any res, can't it?

The amount of tax so collected or withheld shall be

MR. WINTERHALTER:

QUESTION:

10

Yes, it can.

But —

You -- don't you think that's —

might be what it intended here?

11

MR. WINTERHALTER:

No, I do not believe it did.

12

I believe the — when Congress enacted Section 7501, which

13

was back in 1934, it had contemplated providing some

14

protections for the government in the collection of their

15

taxes.

16

empower the government to enforce its collection efforts.

17

Section 6672 would be an example.

18

They have provided other statutes which expressly

QUESTION:

Well, suppose what the company did in

19

this case with respect to monies that was paid from the

20

general account, drew one check to the general account and

21

then immediately — pardon me — drew one check from the

22

general check to the special account —

23

MR. WINTERHALTER:

24

QUESTION:

25

Yes.

— then a second check special

account to the government.

Does that create the trust?

MR. WINTERHALTER:

1
2

Absolutely.

I think there is

the act of the segregation itself.
QUESTION:

3

And — and you couldn't set it aside

4

as a preference that putting it in the trust was a

5

preference?

6

from the argument you're making now?

7

MR. WINTERHALTER:

I mean, how would that would be any different

Well, I think in the

8

situation which you have raised in your hypothetical,

9

there is the — there is the designation.

There is the

10

creation of the trust res which allows it to come into

11

existence.
There is oftentimes suggested that the normal

12

13

business operates properly ---

14

QUESTION:

15

But it's not — it's not a preference

to create a trust res?

16

MR. WINTERHALTER:

17

QUESTION:

18

But it — but it — but it is — but

it is a preference to directly to pay the IRS?

19
20

No, I do not —

MR. WINTERHALTER:

Let me correct that

statement.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. WINTERHALTER:

That — that doesn't make sense.
I believe that it would be a

23

preference to create a trust res for any party.

24

believe under Section 7501 Congress had enacted a

25

provision which gives the IRS special treatment under

QUESTION:

3

And that is when the trust money

Mr. — Mr. Winterhalter, it -- it

4

seems to me -- I don't — I don't understand why you say

5

— why you say that there has to be a res in order for a

6

trust to be created.

7

Justice pointed out — if it says it shall be created, the

8

Federal Government can make it happen.

9

But if the statute, as the Chief

I should think that — that the problem here is

10

not whether it's created, but how you identify it, that

11

when the government says in this statute that it will be a

12

special fund in trust, you don't know what the res is.

13

You don't know whether it's the bank accounts or the

14

corporate — the corporation's real property or any of the

15

other assets of the corporation.

16

And, therefore, when it comes to — to

17

identifying something that — that is subject to this

18

special privilege, you can't identify it.

19

it couldn't be created, it's that it's not identifiable

20

later.

It isn't that

Isn't that your — your point?

My point is, Justice Scalia,

22

that there must be some act, some separation.

does not have to be the deposit into the approved tax

But there must

be something.

The — for the, for the trust to be

created, there must be something to set aside.

in their brief.

There must be the creation that the --

QUESTION:

It can't

It could be created in the abstract,

6

but you can't give it effect in the abstract.

can identify a res, you can't identify the trust corpus.
MR. WINTERHALTER:

Unless you

I don't believe I disagree

with that.
QUESTION:

But when must it be created?

I'm not

11

sure I understand your position on that.

withholding obligation.

14

they pay $1,000 to the — to the employees and don't do

15

anything to with the two hundred until after the

16

bankruptcy.

They have $1,200 in the bank and

2

believe that that — I would believe that that would be a

3

preference.

4

I believe that's the situation here.

We have funds being used which were in the

5

account, but no connection being made between the $200 in

6

your hypothetical and the $700,000 in this hypothetical

7

which would connect the monies collected with the trust

being created.

the money to pay the government?

MR. WINTERHALTER:

That is — that is correct.

It simply says the money that was withheld shall become

MR. WINTERHALTER:

If there has been no

QUESTION:

I'm sure you do.

Mr. Winterhalter, it's — it's my

understanding of trust law that if you declare yourself to

be a trustee of a res which is not in existence at the

18

time, but later declare the res, it is effective.

19

is, if I tell my nephew I am putting in trust $500 for you

20

and in fact I don't, but several weeks later I set aside

21

the $500 and I say this is the — this is the trust corpus

22

for my nephew, that's effective.

I agree.
Now, at — until the check was

It could have been the company's plant.

It could have

Yes.

The

reasonable assumptions, with one such assumption being any

3

amount remaining in commingled accounts is the IRS' money.

4

QUESTION:

I — I assume that what you assert

5

the Federal Government can do by using the device of trust

6

law, you are willing to acknowledge that state governments

7

can do as well.

8

MR. MARTIN:

9

QUESTION:

Absolutely.
So, a state government could say,

10

henceforward, any taxes owed to the state shall be a trust

11

and they would — they -- they would acquire a preference

12

under bankruptcy law.

13

MR. MARTIN:

You think about that for a minute.
If -- if they have a parallel

14

system, sure.

15

law, under private instrument, whatever it is, payments of

16

trust funds cannot be preferences because they're not

17

properties of the debtor.

18

I mean, if — if a trust is created under

That's right.

Let me go back to the question you asked about

19

— okay, a trust has been created, but how do we know that

20

the payments are payments of trust fund taxes.

21

know in this case because of the black letter law that a

22

trustee may designate any funds, its personal funds, its

23

corporate funds, whatever it wants to, as trust funds

24

taxes or -- as the trust property.

25

dissipated the trust, they can restore it with any funds

Well,

1
2

they want.
So when they write a check that clears, as in

3

this case, that's sufficient to identify the — the trust.

4

And I think that's what Congress oontemplated in the House

5

report which this Court has viewed as authoritative of

6

Congress' intent in 1978.

7

report — and this is at page 26 of our brief — that the

8

payment of withholding taxes will not be a preference if

9

they have been properly been held for payment, as they

When it said, in the House

10

will have been if the debtor is able to make the payments.

11

So, we think that Congress thinks that if the debtor is

12

able to make the payments, if the tax withholder can make

13

the payments, the checks clear, that no further connection

14

is required.

15

Now, there may be cases if — where trust fund

16

taxes are not paid over, they file for bankruptcy, when

17

the IRS wants to identify the funds.

18

case, we would be entitled to use reasonable assumptions.

19

One of the assumptions is that any — any amounts

20

remaining in commingled accounts are the taxes.

21

In that type of

But here we have more than that.

We know that

22

there were amounts remaining.

23

also have the identification of the payments as trust fund

24

taxes by the trustee — in this case, AIA.

1

I mean, it — it seems to me it might be possible to read

2

the first sentence of 7501(a) as — as its whole purpose

3

is simply to -- to lay the basis for the second sentence.

4

That is, the — the only reality that this fund has in the

5

world is to enable the assessment, collection and payment

6

in the same manner as the taxes out of which it arose.

7

MR. MARTIN:

Well, that's — that's not what

8

Congress was doing in '34.

Until 1934, this liability was

9

just a tax debt and had to be treated as such.

And

Congress wanted to — to say no, once the withholding has

occurred, it's our money.

It's our money.

You can use trust

I think that's clear.

There was no withholding in 1934.

That must have been added later, wasn't it?

17

MR. MARTIN:

Yeah, in '34 — it dealt with the

18

excise taxes only and said that — that money was held in

19

trust.

20

Whenever withholding began is when it was — 7501 was

21

amended to apply to withholdings in addition to excise

22

taxes.

23

It was added — I think it was '39 or '40.

I think the last sentence of 7501(a) just means

24

that the that the IRS can use the notice and assessment

Mr. Martin, in — in the case of the

special fund that is created that is a separate earmarked

10

bank account, if the employer coming upon hard times

11

decides to change his mind or its mind and takes the money

12

back, is — is there some kind of criminal liability?

13

MR. MARTIN:

Yes.

Yes.

6672 is the 100 percent

14

penalty provision for every responsible officer, and I

15

think there would be a 100 percent liability there.

16

there is also a criminal penalty for willfully violating

Form 940 returns would reflect Federal unemployment tax
