ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. TUCKER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The sole issue presented by this case is whether a

12

federal district court sitting in diversity to which a

13

case has been transferred pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section

14

1404 is required to apply the law that would have been

15

applied had there been no transfer, where the transfer is

16

from a court having proper jurisdiction, having proper

17

venue, but the motion to transfer was made by a plaintiff.

18

The present proceedings were initiated by the

19

Petitioners, residents of Pennsylvania, when the exercised

20

their venue privilege by filing a timely complaint in the

21

United States District Court for the Southern District of

22

Mississippi, asserting claims for negligence and product

23

liability against Respondent John Deere, arising out of

24

Petitioner Albert Ferens' loss of his hand while cleaning

25

his combine manufactured by the Respondent.

want to stress for this Court.

but the determination of whether or not that case is going

after weighing all of the various factors that are

That is clearly

the practice of using the transfer to defeat the state law

advantages accruing to the Plaintiff from its initial

18

selection of the forum, and Van Dusen proscribes that kind

19

of conduct.

But it is our belief that the

Now, the venue privilege that is accorded to a
plaintiff is well established in the law.

The Judicial

10

Code of 1948 established venue rights for plaintiffs

11

seeking to bring suits in federal court.

12

of the Judicial Code -- of that provision, provides broad

13

latitude to plaintiffs seeking to bring suits against

14

defendant corporations.

15

a district where all the plaintiffs reside, or in the

16

district where the cause of action arose, but venue is

17

also appropriate with respect to corporations in the

18

district where the corporation was incorporated, in any

19

district in wrhich it is licensed to do business, and in

20

any district in which it is in fact doing business.

21

Section 1391(c)

Not only is venue appropriate in

Implicit in the provision of broad venue rights to

22

a plaintiff is the recognition that a plaintiff can select

law in one of those forms that is more favorable than his

24

selection of another form in the applicable law.

advantages that arose because of such a selection.

3

Indeed, this Court specifically deemed those rights worthy

4

of protection against defendants who sought to use Section

5

1404 to defeat those rights.

6

Section 1404 that indicates that it is any way intended to

defeat plaintiff's venue privilege and the accrual of

advantageous state law.

Your case would have more,»perhaps, gut

appeal to it if you had kept your so-called venue

11

privilege in Mississippi and not transferred it back to

12

Pittsburgh, where the action — or accident occurred.

13

MR. TUCKER:

Well, Your Honor, what I am suggesting

14

though is that the applicable law selection is a result of

15

the initial selection of an appropriate venue forum.

16

That's implicit by the way that Section 1391 is phrased.

17

Section 1404, which provides for transfers, is not an

18

automatic right.

20

different set of laws that will be applicable to the case.

The law that should be applied in the case is that which

is applied as a result of the initial selection of the

forum.

24

we have a right to do so.

1

1404, if you view the specific express language,

2

contains nothing indicating that a transfer of venue

3

should result in- a transfer of the applicable law.

4

QUESTION:

Is it — is it perfectly clear under

5

1404 that it is available to plaintiffs on the same terms

6

it is — as it is to defendants?

7

MR. TUCKER:

It's — it does not specifically say

8

this statute is available to plaintiffs, but it talks it

9

for the convenience of parties, it does not limit it to

10

availability of defendants.

11

majority of cases that have addressed that issue have said

12

that it- clearly is something that is available to

13

plaintiffs as well as to defendants.

14

that there is any question about its availability.

QUESTION:

And in fact, I think the vast

And on the same terms substantially as

is to defendants?
MR. TUCKER:

There is nothing in the language

18

indicating that its availability is on different terms.

19

know that there is an amicus curiae brief that suggested

20

that the factors that might be considered in determining

21

whether or not to grant a motion made by a plaintiff are

22

different than those which might be considered in a

23

defendant-initiated motion, but that issue really isn't

24

before the Court, because in this case the motion was made

25

and the Respondent did not oppose it.

Well, what I —
It doesn't seem to me an unreasonable

rule.
MR. TUCKER:

I think what we are talking about,

19

Your Honor, is not necessarily simply the right to select

20

the venue, because obviously by transferring a case you

21

are changing the venue.

22

what the court talked about in Van Dusen, and that's the

23

state law advantages that accrue as^the result of the

24

selection of a particular forum.

to defeat those state law advantages.
QUESTION:

MR. TUCKER:

I understand that, Your Honor, but I

17

am suggesting that in Van Dusen the Court's consideration

18

of 1404 led it to conclude that essentially 1404 has

19

nothing to do with the applicable law following a

20

transfer.

21

nothing other than a judicial housekeeping measure, that

22

all it dealt with was the location of litigation, and all

23

it did was authorize a transfer from one court room to

24

another court room, that it should have no effect

25

whatsoever on the applicable law following that transfer.

2

If it is as clear as that, why would we

reserve the question, as we did explicitly?
MR. TUCKER:

3

Because the question was not before

5

Court not to decide issues that are not before it.

like, in this case, —

MR. TUCKER:

QUESTION:

I am sorry, Your Honor?
You, you seem to concede that it is a

real issue.
MR. TUCKER:

Just

I seem to concede that what is a real

issue?

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. TUCKER:

Whether Van Dusen applies to this case.
Oh, I don't think — Van Dusen does

15

not specifically apply to this case, because the Court

16

reserved judgment on that question.

17

implication can be drawn from the fact that judgment was

18

reserved on the issue that is before the Court now, as to

19

whether the Court would have decided that issue one way or

20

the other.

QUESTION:

We usually don't reserve questions that

are foregone conclusions from the reasoning.

4

MR. TUCKER:

But this Court generally, I don't

5

think, decides issues that aren't before it.

And in the

6

case of Van Dusen what was before the Court was a

7

defendant-initiated transfer, not a plaintiff-initiated

8

transfer, and there was therefore no reason for the Court

9

to decide one way or the other.

Just like in the present

10

case, the issue is not before the Court as to what happens

11

where the plaintiff has selected an improper initial

12

forum.

13

position, and we are not arguing here today that if the

14

plaintiff selects an improper initial forum, either

15

because of venue or jurisdictional grounds, that he still

16

is entitled to the applicable law of the transferor state.

17

And I would submit that —

20

That issue is not before the Court.

QUESTION:

It is not our

that the transferor state would have applied?
MR. TUCKER:

The law that the transferor state

21

would have applied, yes, Your Honor.

opinion coming out of the Court today will reserve

23

judgment on that issue because it is not before the Court.

Just as the plaintiff-initiated transfer question was not

before the Court in Van Dusen.

initiated transfer which compels any different result than

MR. TUCKER:

It was us that moved to transfer it

back to Pennsylvania because obviously, given the

residence of the plaintiffs, it would be more convenient

for them to try the case in Pennsylvania.

1

I think that issue, Your Honor, has

been resolved in the Van Dusen case, because one of the

3

questions there was what it means — what that particular

4

phraseology means, where it might have been brought.

5

if I recall correctly, the Court in Van Dusen says that

6

all that means is a jurisdiction or venue and -- a forum

7

where jurisdiction and venue are appropriate, even if it

8

may have resulted in less favorable law.

that there was any basis for denying a transfer to

QUESTION:

11

No, but it surely expresses the

suggestion from Congress that one of the things that the

transferring judge should consider is whether or not the

14

litigation could have gone forward in that case -- in that

state.

different from the question whether there might be a basis

for refusing a transfer.

You couldn't have sued up in Pennsylvania.

the question of whether or not that motion should have

QUESTION:

Well, you say they have abandoned them

because that is the issue we have to decide, isn't it?

6

MR. HELWIG:

Well, I think that is the issue that

7

has to be decided, but the reason I make that point is I

8

think the threshold inquiry is to ask why as a choice of

9

law matter does a court select one statute of limitations

10

or one choice of law rule over another choice of law rule.

11

With regard to statutes of limitation, it's simply the

12

general rule, or the basic principle to which both

13

Pennsylvania and Mississippi subscribe, is that they will

14

apply their own statute of limitations, or their own

15

choice of law rules selecting statutes of limitation, in a

16

case which is pending in that forum.

17

QUESTION:

Well, of course, if it is pending in a

And then you have to show, I suppose,

that there, in order to prevail, that there is some policy

implicit in 1404 that overrides that state choice,

7

whimsical as it may be in some instances.

8

9

MR. HELWIG:

I am not suggesting that there — and

in fact the court has held by its earlier grant of

10

certiorari in vacating the Third Circuit's prior judgment,

11

that Mississippi's choice of law rule is not to be

12

overthrown.

13

But in Wortman, the point isn't -- I think the crucial

14

point in Wortman is yes, the states are free to apply

15

whatever choice of law rules they choose to with regard to

16

statute of limitations.

17

doesn't mean — the court held that you don't federalize

credit require the federal courts to invalidate a given

Would that

— would that cause it to be a plaintiff-initiated

3

MR. HELWIG:

I — that raises a problem of getting

4

into subjective intent of the plaintiff, and I don't think

5

— I think you really have to look to what happens on the

6

record.

7

QUESTION:

So, you would limit it to the case where

the judge calls the parties in and says hey, this looks

the witnesses and the parties are in Pennsylvania.

anybody object if I transfer the case?

You can't try it anywhere else.

MR. HELWIG:

10

It seems to

Well, the problem with that view of

11

not allowing it to go back to Pennsylvania is that that

12

result is not really conducive to the convenience of the

13

parties, the witnesses or the interests of justice to have

these lawsuits marooned down in the some inconvenient

MR. HELWIG:

Well, I — I think it is the

20

QUESTION:

To the extent that this statute of

22

I suppose that the rule that you propose would keep all

suits in Mississippi, because no one would move for

transfer, and that would tend to perpetuate the rule.

That is true.

So why — why shouldn't I do it that way rather

than by saying yes, you can transfer, but the — but the

law that applies is the law of the transferee forum.

MR. HELWIG:

Well, the first answer to that

question is the issue which has been granted — of which

review has been granted, is what happens when there is a

kind of thing we ought to encourage.
