ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. MINEAR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The Paperwork Reduction Act requires 0MB to review

12

agency information collection requests to determine

13

whether they are necessary for the proper performance of

14

the agency's functions.

15

whether that review process applies to the Secretary of

16

Labor's hazard communication standard, which requires

17

employers to compile and maintain chemical hazard

18

information for disclosure to their employees.

19

The question in this case is

I would like to being by explaining how this issue

20

has arisen.

21

believes that the hazard communication standard is subject

22

to paperwork review.

23

I will then explain why the government

The Secretary first published a hazard

24

communication standard in 1983.

That standard, which

25

applied only to the manufacturing sector of the economy,

directed covered employers to develop written hazard

2

communication programs, to compile and maintain material

3

safety data sheets, to ensure that chemical containers are

4

properly labeled and to provide their employers with

5

training concerning workplace chemical hazards.
OMB conducted a paperwork review of that standard

and approved it in full.

8

Third Circuit rejected a number of judicial challenges to

9

the 1983 standard in the decision known as Steelworkers I.

The court of appeals for the

The court took the additional step of ordering the

Secretary to consider extension of the standard to the

12

entire economy.

15

to make that decision on the existing record.

16

Circuit agreed in the decision known as Steelworkers II,

17

and the court threatened the Secretary with contempt

18

sanctions unless she issued a final decision within 60

19

days.

the paperwork requirements associated with three

provisions of the standard.

Based on that record OMB disapproved

Respondents then initiated a new contempt action,

5

arguing that the Secretary's submission of the standard to

6

OMB violated the court's previous orders, because OMB

7

lacked authority to review the pertinent provisions.

8

court agreed and invalidated OMB's disapproval.

9

acknowledged that OMB is required to review information

The

The court

10

collection requests, but it concluded that the provisions

11

at issue are insulated from OMB authority because they

12

embody policy -- substantive policy decision making, and

13

because they do not require the collection of information.

14

The government seeks reversal of that decision.

15

As I stated at the outset, the Paperwork Reduction

16

Act requires OMB to review information collection

17

requests.

18

concluding that the disapproved provisions of the hazard

19

communication standard do not contain such requests.

20

We submit that the court of appeals erred in

We start with the language of the statute.

The

21

Paperwork Reduction Act defines an information collection

22

request as, among other things, a reporting or

23

recordkeeping requirement, collection of information

24

requirement, or other similar method calling for the

25

collection of information.

The disapproved provisions,

1

which required employers to compile, maintain and disclose

2

chemical hazard information, clearly fall within that

3

definition.

4

which specify an employer's obligations with respect to

5

multi-employer worksites, FDA approved drugs and consumer

6

products, all require employers to compile and maintain

7

material safety data sheets in various circumstances.

8

Thus, the disapproved provisions plainly impose

9

recordkeeping requirements.

10
11
12

For example, the three disapproved provisions

QUESTION:

What were the specific items that were

disapproved?
MR. MINEAR:

There are three disapproved

13

provisions.

The first provide — applied to multi­

14

employer worksites, and it required that the material

15

safety data sheets be either collected at the worksite at

16

a centralized location, or that each employer at the

17

worksite transfer his material safety data sheets to other

18

employers.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. MINEAR:

How about the other two?
The other — the next disapproved

21

provision was FDA-approved drugs.

22

instance, it requires that a -- for instance a hospital

23

pharmacy, comply with the hazard communications standard.

24

So that, for instance, a hospital pharmacist, in addition

25

to having to package inserts that he would normally use in

This would require, for

1

evaluating the drugs, would also have to compile and

2

maintain a material safety data sheet for each of those

3

drugs, with the exception of pills or tablets.

4

The third provision —

QUESTION:

6

MR. MINEAR:

Didn't something have to do with labels?
There are no — all of — two of these

7

provisions are involved here.

requirements of the hazard communication —
QUESTION:

How does granting an exemption require

12

anything to be collected?

MR. MINEAR:

It specifies what the particular

employer's obligations might be.

exemption —

18

QUESTION:

For instance, this

Well, I know, but .if you exempt it then

he doesn't have any obligations.
MR. MINEAR:

But it was not a complete exemption,

19

it was only a partial exemption dealing with these

20

provisions.

21

QUESTION:

Well, I know, but nevertheless —

22

nevertheless, the exemption didn't require the collection

or reporting of any information.

MR. MINEAR:

0MB's objection was that this

exemption did not go far enough, and by not going far

4

enough, imposed paperwork requirements on various

regulated employers.

7

MR. MINEAR:

So in that sense it certainly does
It did what?

It — 0MB's position was that the

8

limited nature of the exemption subjected employers to

9

paperwork burdens.

10
11

In this case — let's take the example

of the hospital pharmacist.
QUESTION:

Under this exemption --

Well, to the extent it wasn't exempt, I

12

am sure it imposed paperwork requirements.

13

extent it was exempt, it lessened the requirement.

14

MR. MINEAR:

And 0MB's position was that the

15

exemption did not go far enough.

16

disapproved that provision.

17

QUESTION:

But to the

And that is why it

Mr. Minear, you went through the

18

statutory language a little fast for me, to tell you the

19

truth, on the collection of information.

20

on the statutory provision that is quoted at page 3 of

21

your brief when you say collection of information?

little trouble —

it might be most helpful to turn to the addendum, which

information.
QUESTION:

And then that is defined with the -- in

the statutory provision on page 3 of your brief, isn't it?

8

MR. MINEAR:

9

QUESTION:

That is right.
And that is defined as collection of

information, the obtaining or soliciting of facts or

opinions by an agency.

MR. MINEAR:

QUESTION:

15

MR. MINEAR:

17

Through the use of written

report —

14

16

Yes.

And how is this by an agency?
Because the agency is the party that

is making the request that the information be collected.
QUESTION:

No, no.

How is the collecting by an

18

agency, because your — the information collection request

19

refers to — to collection of information.

21

refers to collection of information by agencies.

MR. MINEAR:

collection of information doesn't specify who the

information is sent to. It only specifies who is making

The obtaining of

facts, soliciting facts or information is by an agency.

you continue reading on, I think my point is clear.

MR. MINEAR:

That's not what it says.

in terms of recordkeeping that also is defined, if we turn

QUESTION:

What if all the agency required was

telling the employer to post certain notices, some safety

notices or equal employment opportunity notices?

19

MR. MINEAR:

The question would be whether the

party — now, there are certain exemptions —

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. MINEAR:

No written report required?
Yes.

But the question would be does

the employer have to gather or maintain information.

23

in the case — suppose for instance it was an NLRB

publication, a notice to employers.

MR. MINEAR:

In any case, most litigation matters are not

There are separate exceptions that deal —

But our basic point and the way that 0MB applies

13

information collection request is subject to 0MB review.

16

QUESTION:

And if there is an

I take it that a control number is

required for every information request?
MR. MINEAR:

Yes.

And so, for instance, a —

17

control number would have been required and was obtained

18

for the regulation, hazard communication standard.

19

does contain a control number.

20

QUESTION:

It

So that if the regulations here had been

21

approved, the control number would simply be on the

information request?

MR. MINEAR:

It would be on — in this case it is

24

on the regulation.

questionnaires.

The notion of the control number --

QUESTION:

Well, I take it all of the documents —

3

that the employers had to assemble pursuant to this

4

regulation, they would not have had to have a control

5

number even if they had been approved?

6

MR. MINEAR:

No.

A control number is applied to

7

the instrument that requires the collection of

8

information; in this case it is the regulation.

9

is — the purpose of the control number is to allow a

And that

10

person — among other things, to allow a person to

11

determine whether OMB has reviewed the information

12

collection request.

13

the regulation itself, identify the control number, and

14

that would verify that OMB had in fact reviewed it.

15

And so a party would look to the —

Now, OMB's implementing regulations, which the

16

Third Circuit did not even acknowledge, compels the same

17

result that I have described here.

information collection request includes any requirement or

request for persons to obtain, maintain, retain, report or

Mr. Minear, before you go further, I

share Justice White's confusion as to — as to how this

exception can be possibly held to be imposing any

requirement.

3

viewed as involving the regulation to which the exception

4

is an exception?

5

7

Is there any way that this case can be

MR. MINEAR:
question.

I am afraid I don't follow that

Could you repeat that?

QUESTION:

Well, it seems to me it is the

8

regulation requiring the — the maintaining of these

9

records and the giving of this information, that is -- is

10

the gravamen of the government activity that -- that the

11

parties are complaining about, not the exception to that.

12

Is there any way that we can regard this case as involving

13

the principle regulation, rather than merely the scope of

14

the exception from the regulation?

15

MR. MINEAR:

Well, I think, to clarify this, the

16

regulation, in terms of identifying what is an information

17

collection request, one could look at the hazard

18

communication itself as being a general information

19

collection request.

20

its very first paragraph, is to require parties to compile

21

and maintain and disclose information.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. MINEAR:

Its general purpose is, as stated in

Right.

Why isn't that so?

So, I think that that is -- that is

24

appropriate, to view that the hazard communication

25

standard itself, as an information collection request.

1

But it also can be viewed as consisting of a number of

2

different discrete information collection requests itself.

3

Now, OMB will only try to carve out objections to those

4

paperwork requirements that it finds objectionable.

5

for that reason it disapproved these exemptions on the

6

basis that they weren't broad enough.

7

of looking at this problem —

8
9
10
11

QUESTION:

It's, another way

It didn't disapprove the exemption, it

disapproved the substantive portion of the rule to which
the exemption applied.
MR. MINEAR:

Or more specifically, it disapproved

12

the paperwork requirements of that substantive

13

requirement.

14
15

And

QUESTION:

And the procedural status of the case

permits us to view it that way?

16

MR. MINEAR:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. MINEAR:

Yes.
Okay.
As I was saying before, the

19

Respondents principal argument here is that the Paperwork

20

Reduction Act should apply only to information collection

21

requests that require submission of information directly

22

to the government.

23

exclude recordkeeping requirements, which is one of the

24

main sources of coverage of the Paperwork Reduction Act,

25

and which was, in fact, a major impetus for the passage of

But as I have pointed out, that would

this act.

2

was to clarify that the predecessor act, the Federal

3

Reports Act, did in fact cover recordkeeping requirements,

4

and those would be subject to 0MB review.

5

One of the principal concerns of the sponsors

QUESTION:

Mr. Minear, their point is, I think,

6

that it covers recordkeeping requirements that, when the

7

records are kept for inspection by the government to carry

8

out its law enforcement responsibilities, like OPA used to

9

require business to keep all sorts of records.

That's the

10

kind of thing they wanted to be sure — it wasn't to keep,

11

to have records for investigation or inspection by third

12

parties, was it?

13

MR. MINEAR:

Well, first we disagree with that,

14

because I think that the Act has no express provision,

15

nothing in the text suggests concretely that regular

16

into account the entirety of the Paperwork Reduction Act,

2

and most particularly the portions of the Act that we

3

reproduce on page 39 of our brief, which state that the

4

authority of 0MB shall be exercised consistent with

5

applicable law and that nothing in this chapter shall be

6

interpreted as increasing or decreasing the authority of

7

0MB with respect to the substantive policies and programs

8

of departments, agencies and offices, acted properly in

9

disapproving these provisions.

10

Our basic position, which has been foreshadowed by

11

the discussion thus far, is that when Congress talked

12

about information collection requests, as the language of

13

the statute persuasively indicates, Congress was talking

14

about the collection of information by the government and

15

for the government use.

16

this regard and we lay out the basic points at pages 24

17

and 25 of our brief.

18

The indications are numerous in

First of all, as has been pointed out, this statute

19

has to do with alleviating certain burdens on private

20

parties, and the burdens are defined as the time, effort

21

or financial resources expended by persons to provide

22

information to a federal agency.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Gold, do you agree that 0MB is

24

entitled to a certain amount of deference in its

construction of the provisions of the act that are

MR. GOLD:

We — we think that they are entitled to

3

a certain amount of deference, but you get into the

4

question which is one which is — we well understand a

5

difficult one, whether OMB is moving into an area that was

6

never intended by Congress to be regulated.

7

issue that has proved perplexing to the court.

9

is given a limited function, can expand that function —

QUESTION:

line-drawing questions which we think are inherent in the

point you've just articulated, and that there is a

16

threshold question every time an agency asks for

17

deference.

18

which Congress didn't permit the agency to enter at all.

19

I mean, this is a problem, and we quote the cases which

20

have been particularly acute in the National Labor

21

Relations Act-

22

court said that the issue of whether the agency could

23

regulate the economic weapons of parties when they were

engaged in collective bargaining was, I think I have the

MR. GOLD:

Well, plainly it has no jurisdiction to

And I do think that there is a problem in

21

speaking in metaphors of this kind, but that doesn't mean

22

that there isn't a basic kernel of truth.

23

seems to us, quite a paradox in saying that if the agency

24

wants to aggrandize its authority and Congress has

25

provided for judicial review, the judiciary is to accept

There is, it

that aggrandizing step if it is reasonable.

There are

other areas where there — where it's quite plain that the

question arises in the interstices of the statute within

doesn't arise.
But, for the purpose of this discussion, it seems

to me that we have two alternatives.

11

and 0MB, giving it deference, deserves to lose this case.

12

Secondly, there is a limit in deference,

It does seem, to us, for the reasons I was starting

13

to develop and that have been noted by various members of

14

the Court, that there isn't a word in this statute which

15

pushes towards the conclusion that Congress intended to

16

cover as an information collection requirement materials

17

which, as a substantive matter A has to provide to B for

18

B's protection, as opposed to materials which, as the

19

statute says again and again are provided to the

20

government for its use either in policy making or law

21

making or in law enforcement.

24

collection of information requirement, and the entire

25

point of the exercise, which is to determine whether the

information has practical utility, which is defined to

2

mean the ability of an agent — of an agency to use

3

information it collects, particularly the capability to

4

process such information in a timely and useful fashion.

5

Every part of the statute most fairly read speaks

6

to the question which, not surprisingly the legislative

7

history shows was the only question posed to Congress,

8

namely, should there be a system of rationalizing and

9

assuring that the bureaucracy's appetite for information

10

for its own use, particularly in the planning stage,

11

should be reviewed and should be subject to efficiency and

12

other rationality controls.

13

controls by an agency, namely OMB, which has an overall

14

management function for the government, and which has no

15

particular parochial interest in the information at hand.

Efficiency and rationality

16

And we have no doubt that the Paperwork Reduction

17

Act, in those terms, in its efficiency terms in assuring

18

that agencies only ask for what they can use and

19

demonstrate that what they are asking for can be, as the

20

statute so strongly indicates, can be processed and

21

assimilated in a rational way.

22

Not surprisingly, OMB's spokesman at the hearings,

23

and this on page 26 of our brief, said no one questions

24

the basic need of the for information to plan, make policy

And the result was a determination that we are not going

And in those terms the comparison here is entirely

of these exemptions, OSHA said that, with regard to drugs,

Right.

cases, that we were upholding them, would it?

9

MR. GOLD:

Well, I presume, to deal with the second

10

of these two questions, you would have to confront our

11

arguments that OMB disregarded the substantive policies

12

and programs of the statute, and therefore acted

13

improperly in this case.

14

QUESTION:

It would just be contrary to law.

MR. GOLD:

Yes.

That is part of construing what

necessary for the performance of the functions of the

2

agency, 0MB has to take account of and conform to the

3

substantive requirements in this instance of the

4

Occupational Safety and Health Act.

5

do so in this case.

6

And that 0MB did not

And that that is demonstrable.

Not only, as I have indicated, is it hard to find a

7

scintilla of reason in what 0MB did in terms of the lines

8

it drew, but much more to the point, as I started to note,

9

the Occupational Safety and Health Act sets out a highly

10

protective standard with regard to the balance between

11

employer financial interests and employee safety and

12

health interests.

13

This Court has put it, in American Textile

14

Manufacturers, which is at 452 U.S., that Section 6(b)(5)

15

of OSHA directs the Secretary to issue the standard that

16

most adequately assures that no employee will suffer

17

material impairment of health, limited only by the extent

18

to which this is capable of being done.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Gold, you did — you did make this

20

argument in your brief in opposition to the petition too,

21

so we couldn't get rid of it on some procedural nicety, I

22

suppose?

MR. GOLD:

We tried to —

1

And we make the argument starting at page 39

2

through to the conclusion of our brief on the merits.

And

3

our basic point on this is that if indeed this is a

4

collection of information request, that at least where the

5

statute is as plain and clear as this statute is, 0MB

6

cannot, in the guise of determining whether something is

7

necessary for the performance of the function of the

8

agency, rewrite the balance in a way which is entirely

9

different from the underlying substantive statute.

That

10

just reads out of the Paperwork Reduction Act itself the

11

provision that in carrying out its functions it has to

12

respect the substantive policies and programs.

13

it is absolutely manifest, for the reasons that we

14

develop, that 0MB applied a completely different standard

15

in determining what ought to be promulgated to employees

16

than the OSH Act mandates.

17

And here

The conclusion with regard to this multi-employer

18

worksite issue at 0MB was that OSHA is wrong that

employees need or will use this information.

20

will have difficulty coordinating the provision of the

21

information.
