ORAL ARGUMENT OF S. ADELE SHANK

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MS. SHANK:

8

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

Court:
The issues in the present case are three.

11

First, can an unconstitutionally, overbroad statute be

12

construed on appeal and then retroactively applied to

13

affirm the Appellant's conviction?

14

Second, may this state, consistent with First

15

Amendment rights, prohibit the private, in-home possession

16

of depictions of child nudity, where the nudity consists

17

of either a lewd exhibition or involves a graphic focus on

18

the genitals?

19

And third, has the Ohio Supreme Court

20

successfully limited Ohio's child nudity statute to bring

21

it within constitutional limitations?

22

Clyde Osborne was charged under an Ohio statute

23

prohibiting the possession of pictures of nude children.

24

This statute was unconstitutionally overbroad on its face

25

and as applied to Mr. Osborne.

The statute prohibited

simple possession and mere viewing.

2

It failed to include an element of scienter, as

3

required by this Court's decisions in Smith v. California

4

and New York v. Ferber.

5

below which children could not be depicted, also as

6

required by New York v. Ferber, and it prohibited

7

depictions of mere nudity, contrary to this Court's

8

decisions in Erznoznik v. Jacksonville and Ferber.

It failed to specify the age

Mr. Osborne challenged the constitutionality of

9
10

the statute prior to trial.

The court denied his motion,

11

and the trial proceeded under the statute as written.

12

Only at the close of evidence did the trial court rule

13

that the statute applied to depictions of those under the

14

age of 18.

15

Mr. Osborne was convicted.

16

On appeal, the Tenth District Court of Appeals

17

affirmed 18 as the age of minority, and construed nudity

18

to mean a lewd exhibition of the genitals.

19

The Ohio Supreme Court redefined nudity on

20

review to drop the requirement that genitalia by depicted

21

nudity now means, under that court's interpretation,

22

either a lewd exhibition or, in the alternative, a

23

depiction involving a graphic focus on the genitals.

24

court added an element of scienter, recklessness, and

25

again affirmed that 18 is the upper limit of the age of

Mr. Osborne's conviction was affirmed under this

new construction and he moved for rehearing on the ground

that this retroactive conviction violated his right to due

issue.

And this is the basis of our first

The statute in this case, as I previously noted,

10
11

was unconstitutional on its face and due to its

12

unconstitutionality was invalid.

13

under such a statute is a nullity, and the conviction

14

cannot be brought to life by a subsequent

15

constitutionalizing construction of the statute.

A conviction obtained

This principle is well established in precedent

16
17

from this Court.

18

Alabama, and Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, this Court has

19

held that an unconstitutional statute is in fact invalid

20

on its face, that no one is required to comply with such a

21

statute, and that a subsequent construction will not

22

succeed in criminalizing preconstruction conduct.

doctrine.

How old was the child in question

here?
MS. SHANK:

There was hearsay testimony that the

3

child was either 13 or 14.

4

that issue was made, and the jury was instructed only to

5

find that the child was under the age of 18, Your Honor.

6

8

QUESTION:

However, no finding of fact on

Any question that what Mr. Osborne —

Mr. Osborne knew the age?
MS. SHANK:

Your Honor, Mr. Osborne did testify

9

that he had been told that the age of the child was 14,®

10

however, he had no actual or personal knowledge, and this

11

was brought out in the course of the presentation of

12

evidence at trial.

13

As I was saying, the essence of the overbreadth

14

doctrine is that when a statute is unconstitutional on its

15

face and one challenges the unconstitutionality of that

16

statute, when the challenge has been — successful, the

17

appellant cannot then be convicted under new and

18

constitutionalizing construction of the statute.

19

QUESTION:

Well, correct me if I'm wrong,

20

please, but those cases were not ones, were they, in which

21

this Court or any other court held they were susceptible

22

of being sustained under a narrowing construction?

court had in effect already given a narrowing construction

2

— this is the second Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, because

3

there are two of the same name — had already been

4

construed by the court by the time — by the lower state

5

court by the time it reached this Court, and the Court

6

accepted, for purposes of that case, that the new

7

construction was constitutional, but still held that

8

conviction under the old unconstitutional statute was not

9

allowable.

QUESTION:

But — but that wasn't because the

11

statute was a nullity, was it?

12

MS. SHANK:

invalid on its face.

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

The statute was

MS. SHANK:

No, because, in the interim, it has

17

been subjected to a new constitutionalizing construction,

18

QUESTION:

Well, then, if you say — then, if

20

you say it a nullity, it seems to me that's a term that's

not — the definition of which is not self-evident.

22

certainly wasn't a nullity in the sense that the

legislature didn't have to reenact it.

points that demonstrates that it was a nullity —

QUESTION:

2

MS. SHANK:

3

QUESTION:

I am right about that.
Excuse me, Your Honor?
The legislature did not have to

4

reenact it; it was still on the books with the narrowing

5

construction after the state narrowed it.

6

MS. SHANK:

That's true.

However, the Court did

7

say in Shuttlesworth that under the statute, as it was

8

written in its unconstitutional form, even though

9

Shuttlesworth had applied for a permit, that he had been

10

under no obligation to do so because of the statute's

11

invalidity.

12

person had no obligation to comply with the statute

13

because it was invalid, and then to subject them to a

14

conviction, simply because it had later on been construed.

15

And it would completely unfair to say that a

And so I think the fact that that — there was

16

no requirement to comply with the invalid statute is a

17

clear indication that it was in fact a nullity, because

18

the Court wouldn't say you didn't have to comply with a

19

valid statute.

Well, I think that the court can do

particular defendant because the statute is

15

unconstitutional.

MS. SHANK:

1

Well, but, Your Honor, it's no

2

different than when the court makes that same

3

determination at the appellate level.

4

that the decision is mere dictum, it stills says that the

5

defendant is excused from liability and the court's

6

holding is still the next interpretation of the statute

7

that binds everybody else who is prosecuted.
In addition, if I understood your question, I

It doesn't mean

think there is a different kind of situation where the

10

court can narrow.

And that is the one that is frequently

11

cited in Dombrowski, the famous footnote, Dombrowski

12

Number 7.

13

the statute is not its overbreadth, but the overriding

14

problem with the statute is its vagueness.

And that is where the essential problem with

And in those circumstances, that's the kind of

16

case where this Court has held many times that that person

who falls within the hard core of what the statute

addresses doesn't have — can't succeed under a narrowing

type of construction, but —

QUESTION:

Ms. Shank, in — in your view, could

21

the State of Ohio constitutionally apply this statute, now

that the supreme court has construed it, to another

defendant?

2

state interest.

3

constitutional, yes, it would be applicable to those in

4

the future.

But were it, now, successfully made

QUESTION:

5

Well, so, in that sense, as Justice

6

Kennedy points out, there may be some problem with calling

7

it a nullity, if it can be applied to people in the future

8

after the living — after the limiting construction?
MS. SHANK:

9

I understand what you're saying,

10

Your Honor, and I thought about that in terms of whether

11

or not it would be better to try to address the question

12

of void/voidable, but this Court's own language has always

13

been either that it was invalid or that the statute itself

14

was void.

15

And I think that that makes the most sense, in

16

terms of accepting the Federal Constitution as the basis

17

upon which all laws must be built.

18

foundation of the Constitution, it should not have any

19

validity.

20
21
22

If it violates that

And so from that perspective, I think that —
that void is an appropriate term.
And I wanted to point out, Your Honors, that the

23

policy behind allowing this is truly the core of the

24

overbreadth doctrine, which allows one, whose own — whose

25

own conduct may not be protected, to challenge a statute.

1

Because if one, whose own conduct wasn't protected, could

2

not challenge a statute for its overbreadth and succeed,

3

if in fact all that he could achieve would be a narrowing

4

construction and then a subsequent conviction, there would

5

be no point to him ever raising the challenge.

QUESTION:

7

MS. SHANK:

8

QUESTION:

9

It's a possession statute, right?
Yes, Your Honor, it is.
Well, is it — is it clear that we

would apply the overbreadth doctrine to this?

10

is -- what is the expression?

11

expression protected by this?

12

MS. SHANK:

QUESTION:

He's not expressing this photograph

to anybody, it's — it's his own photograph, he could have

15

taken it himself for his own delight, right?

16

MS. SHANK:

That's true, but it's just like a

17

book that you buy for yourself or a diary that you write

18

for yourself, it's -- it's a communication that you hold.

19

QUESTION:

20

MS. SHANK:

To yourself?
Well, certainly.

And when one holds

21

a book and then subsequently reads it, it's still a

relate to the First Amendment, to communication.

2

the restriction is just something you do in the privacy of

3

your own room, I don't see how that's a First Amendment

4

communication interest and how the overbreadth doctrine

5

would even apply to it.

6

MS. SHANK:

But if

Well, Your Honor, I think that

7

anything that one uses -- and now we're moving towards the

8

issue of the privacy interest in your own home —

9

QUESTION:
MS. SHANK:

10

Right.
— anything that one uses in one's

11

own home, whether you want to characterize it as eliciting

12

feelings or as being communicative or generating new

13

thought processes, it's all protected by the First

14

Amendment.

15

state has no interest in controlling the thoughts of any

16

person or controlling what one person has — or in even

17

viewing into the contents of one's library.

As this Court said in Stanley v. Georgia, the

is a First Amendment, protected-type of communication.
QUESTION:

A lot of water has flowed under the

21

bridge since Stanley, Ms. Shank.

You know the Court

22

really narrowed Stanley (inaudible) and cases like that.

And — and here the state, I would think, has considerable

24

interest in preventing any access to child pornography in

25

a way it wouldn't have to just obscenity.

MS. SHANK:

1

Well, one of the things about this

2

case is I don't believe that the state has demonstrated

3

any kind of compelling interest in regulating the

4

materials addressed in this statute, at least with regard

5

to those that depict children under the age of 18 and over

6

the age of 15.

7
8

QUESTION:

Well, why does the state — why does

the state have to demonstrate a compelling interest?
MS. SHANK:

9

Well, even if the Court wanted to

10

say it was merely substantial, but we are talking about

11

fundamental constitutionally guaranteed rights —

13

QUESTION:

A fundamental, constitutionally

guaranteed to have child pornography?

No, it's not a right to child

Well, but — but you're — in this

minor males in his possession, so as to apply it to him,

it's a right to receive child pornography, isn't it?
MS. SHANK:

21

It would be — that — that would be

22

included within that broad right, yes, Your Honor, it

would be.

state has to show some -- you say a compelling interest,

1

but perhaps that isn't the test; that's the interest the

2

state is protecting here.

3

MS. SHANK:

Well, the state does claim to be

4

protecting its right to stop sexual abuse of children,

5

which it says is necessarily involved in production of

6

these types of pictures.

7

least with regard to those over the age of 15, permits

8

sexual conduct.

However, the State of Ohio, at

13

that is, any kind of sexual activity with one 15 years of

age or older.

Fifteen is the age

And I think before the state can claim that it

has an interest in stopping sexual abuse of children by

invading people's homes and privacy and controlling the

making that actual conduct illegal.

MS. SHANK:

3

Well, the state certainly has an

4

obligation, before it starts trying to allege that it's

5

working towards that goal, to make the activity involved

6

in such depictions illegal, and it has not.

7

much further, it allows all kinds of sexual conduct.

And it goes

And in addition, if the state truly is

interested in stopping that kind of activity, it would” not

have created the exceptions that exist in this statute.

Parents are now permitted to possess depictions of

children that are lewd exhibitions or involve a graphic

Parents are now, under this interpretation of

and leaves a broad area of the activity it supposedly has

2

an interest in stopping, unprohibited, the state has

3

demonstrated its lack of a compelling interest in dealing

4

with that subject matter.

5

And for that reason, I think the State of Ohio

6

has failed to demonstrate that it has a compelling

7

interest either in prohibiting the private, in-home

8

possession of these materials or in prohibiting, in the

9

b'roader question of the overbreadth of the statute, in

10

bringing it into a narrowly-tailored stance that serves a

compelling state interest.

Do you read our cases as saying a

MS. SHANK:

QUESTION:

I read Stanley v. Georgia —
I think the answer to that is no,

that obscenity is just deemed not to be protected speech.

That's true, but I believe that when

you go to the point of prohibiting the private, in-home

21

possession, as noted in Stanley v. Georgia, and there, are

22

again attacking or invading the fundamental rights to

1

Now, again, and the third issue in our case is

2

that we do not believe that these pictures fall within a

3

category of unprotected speech.

4

this Court said that in order to constitute child

5

pornography, the depictions must include characterization

6

— pictures of sexual conduct.

7

this statute.

8

9

In New York v. Ferber,

That's not required in

And depictions of sexual conduct or sexual
activity of any kind are regulated by two other statutes,

10

the two that immediately precede this one, Ohio Revised

11

Code 2907.321 and 322.

12
13
14

In fact, these still regulate depictions of mere
nudity.
Now, this Court in Ferber did say that graphic

15

or — lewd exhibitions of the genitals, so long as that

16

phrase was not construed too broadly, would qualify as

17

sexual conduct.

18

has limited the requirement that genitalia be depicted,

19

and this construction is the only statute in the many that

20

deal with this type of material that doesn't at least

21

require that genitalia be depicted, and for that reason,

22

brought it into the definition of nudity, which is

23

included in 2907.01(H).

24

breasts, buttocks, the pubic area, as well as genitals.

25

and even under the broadest characterization of the kind

2

of materials this court felt could be characterized as

3

unprotected in New York v. Ferber, this statute falls.

4

And as I previously pointed, out, this statute

5

does not address depictions that are commercial in nature.

6

It also includes mere possession and viewing — simple

7

viewing of these photographs.

8

production and distribution of this type of material.

9

And Ferber dealt with the

For that reason, we do not believe that it falls

10

within the Ferber definition, and as I previously pointed

11

out, I do not think that it fits the state — that the

state has demonstrated a compelling state interest in

13

prohibiting the possession of these materials.

Ohio has adopted a comprehensive statutory

the material is obscene under Miller, to material that

2

distribution, but it's also necessary to get to the point

3

of prohibiting possession of material that fits — fits

those three state statutes, not only with respect to the

lewd exhibition of the genitals, but also with respect to

7

the obscene and/or the actual sexual conduct depicted in

The state thinks that the defendant in this

Court is extending what this Court has repeatedly said

11

should be viewed narrowly, and that is the — the Stanley

12

decision from 1969.

13

and the Court, I think, when the Court factors in the

14

Ferber decision with Stanley, and looking at Stanley

15

itself, it said, where — where compelling reasons exist,

16

the state can enter into the home and prohibit certain

17

possessory offenses involving printed, filmed or recorded

18

material.

19

Stanley obviously predated Ferber,

That this case is an exception to Stanley in

20

that regard, that this — this case is a case that does

21

present compelling reasons, as the Court recognized in the

— in the subsequent Ferber decision.

the defendant's knowledge of this young man — young man's

concerned about.

It is the

Court construed it could look at that the continuum I

mentioned earlier, look also specifically at this statute

itself sets forth the kinds of circumstances that would be

should respond, and that is looking at the statute as a

whole, and looking at the exemptions and exceptions in

there, that it did give fair notice, fair warning to Mr.

it was designed to address, and not just mere nudity.

proper purposes that are in the statute itself.

there's no reason for them to be in there if the defendant

they did, or did they just say the statute has always

MR. O'BRIEN:

Is that what

I — I read it, Justice White, as

5

saying that we are construing this statute, and this is

6

what it meant when it was enacted and when it was adopted,

7

and that's what it's directed at.

that's how I read the decision, and they were not doing

anything other than construing that statute in that

regard.
QUESTION:

So that's different than a

legislative revision of the statute pending appeal?
MR. O'BRIEN:

In my view it is, because in a

14

tradition of common law, the courts, on appeal, have that

15

option of construing statute, and I think it's different

16

than a subsequent legislative amendment changing the

17

elements of the offense, particularly with respect to what

happened in Oakes.

I would make that distinction.

MR. O'BRIEN:

2

Well, I guess it just seems to me

3

that the defendant would be better positioned to argue

that — that it was error and — and reversal of his

5

conviction is justified had he requested it and had it

6

been denied.
And maybe I'm wrong in that regard, but it just

7
8

seems to me that that would be a better position for the

9

defendant to be in than to not have requested it, not have

10

it denied and have the matter go up on appeal and raise it

11

for the first time in an appellate court, and — and say

12

that — that it was a problem.
QUESTION:

13

Does Ohio have any doctrine that the

14

courts will imply an intent requirement?

15

ago this Court decided a case called United States against

16

Morrisett, where we said that even thought the statute

17

punishing someone criminally did not say that there was an

18

intent requirement, one would be implied on common law

19

principles.

20

About 40 years

And so the federal courts have frequently

21

implied the existence of an intent requirement, even

22

though the statute didn't say so.

Does Ohio have any similar doctrine, do you
know?

the Ohio Revised Code, and it's discussed in the Ohio

2

Supreme Court opinion in this regard, says that when a

3

statute is silent with respect to intent or scienter that

4

unless the — the criminal proscription plainly indicates

5

that strict liability is to be imposed, that you pick up

6

another statute with a minimum culpable mental state of

7

recklessness, which — which, at least in this regard, is

8

— is the perverse — the disregard of a known risk.
QUESTION:

9

So a defendant defending a

10

prosecution under this statute would have presumably been

11

justified in asking for an instruction on recklessness in

12

this case, on the basis of that statute?

MR. O'BRIEN:

That would be my view, Mr. Chief

have possession offenses on — on the books in the various

3

states have great concern, and that is whether Stanley

4

would preclude the application of a possession offense

5

when we're dealing with the defendant's own home.

6

It's our position that the Court found in -- in

7

Ferber that there are a number of interests the state has

8

in controlling and regulating child pornography, mainly

9

because of the harm caused to children through its

10

production, distribution and use.

11

physical, psychological, emotional mental, physiological,

12

and that that interest in proscribing possession of the

13

material is the same as it is in a production and

14

distribution.

That harm being

The permanent record of harm which the Court was

concerned with in Ferber is ongoing and continues, while

the market.

in addition to the interest of avoiding that continuing

5

haunting fear on the child who's been used in this kind --

6

in producing this kind of material.

7

That is an interest I believe the state has,

The Court was concerned with — and noted in

8

Ferber itself that that permanent record was evidence of

9

ongoing harm due to the psychological and emotional

10

distress to the youngster.

Just by knowing the fact that

11

it's out there, many times it's used to blackmail the

12

youngsters, the fear of subsequent public exposure or use

13

in commercial distributions all cause that child, in

14

trying to recover from the original abuse, the child's

15

sexual abuse, trying to recover, that is what the experts

16

say a severe problem in addressing it.

17

And I think the possession statute, in — by

18

just merely saying it is illegal to possess it, goes a

19

very long way in — in fighting the problem, which has

20

been — has gone underground, in trying to dry up that

MR. O'BRIEN:

I mean, that's still an

It's an effective way, Justice

4

Stevens, but I — I believe that the states need that

5

additional tool of a possessory offense.

6

they are denied that possessory offense and are told you

7

must only prosecute people in this industry or pedophiles

8

who are interested in collecting or keeping this material,

9

if you are only permitted to prosecute those who produce

If they are —

10

or sell it or otherwise distribute it, I think we're going

11

to have a serious problem in trying to — to continue to

address it, simply because the production is always

13

surreptitious.

14

QUESTION:

Well, but that's true of a lot of

fact that it's underground means that — that the

2

prohibition against sale and production is meaningless,

3

but I just don't quite follow.

4

MR. O'BRIEN:

No, it's not meaningless, Your

5

Honor.

In fact, we still have two good statutes that we

6

will use when we can prove production and distribution.

7

What I'm saying is, is because it's underground and you

8

can't walk into Paul Ferber's bookstore in Manhattan and

9

buy child pornography today, that because it's underground

10

that the additional tool of having a possession offense is

11

necessary to address the problem.
And that the state does have an interest in

12

13

going to that possessory offense and applying it to -- to

14

the home or anywhere else that it might be possessed.

15

So I guess what the state's interest, besides

16

that is, is as we pointed out in our briefing materials,

17

not only the permanent record of harm that exists, but we

18

can attempt to dry up the problem with that additional

tool.

I guess, in comparing those interests with the

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

I think one of the remarks that was

of those kinds of depictions that constitute obscenity in

21

Mr. O'Brien's acknowledgement that those statute

22

will be used — used to go after these people is a clear

23

indication that the construction of this statute has moved

it from what it originally was intended to be by the Ohio

don't — they -- they deny that it's ever been overbroad.

In fact, on page 42 of the joint appendix, the

acknowledges that it is true that the statute does not

exhibition or graphic focus on the genitals.

of back and forth, and that at the conclusion of that

little discussion, they do then say, and that's — this is

3

in the center of the final full paragraph, again, on page

4

42 of the joint appendix, that as — authoritatively

construed that day by the court.
So, I think that although the court does waffle

6

7

on the point, I think it's very clear from its own opinion

8

that it acknowledges that that wasn't the case and that

it's construction that day is what brings the statute into

what it hopes to be constitutional lines.

Another point that was raised by Mr. O'Brien is

12

the fact that he alleges that 18 other states have

No, fair notice and
