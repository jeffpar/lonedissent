ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDITH REED

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11

MS. REED:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Petitioner John Lytle filed a complaint in

12

Federal district court alleging that he had been fired for

13

racially discriminatory reasons and that the Respondent

14

employer had subsequently retaliated against him for

15

racially discriminatory reasons.

16

both 1981 and Title VII.

17

both legal and equitable claims.

18

for a jury trial.

19

legal claims, the district court dismissed the Section

20

1981 claims on reasons that everyone concedes were

21

erroneous and proceeded to trial on the equitable claims,

22

ruling against Petitioner and in favor of Respondent.

While the

1981 claims, it found that it was powerless to reverse and

2

remand, for it held that the judge's findings, if not

3

clearly erroneous, could collaterally estop Petitioner

4

from litigating his claims before a jury.

5

Thus, the import of the holding of the court of

6

appeals is that because the district court proceeded to

7

make findings, his original error in denying a jury trial

8

was unreviewable, meaning therefore that orders denying

9

the jury trial are not reviewable after trial.

10

QUESTION:

Ms. Reed, these were findings in

11

connection, of the sort that are ordinarily made in

12

connection with a bench trial, findings of fact?

13

MS. REED:

The findings on Title VII.

There

14

were findings of fact on whether Title VII had been

15

violated.

16

The issue in this case, then, is at what point a

17

party is entitled to appeal an improper denial of a jury

18

trial.

19

in the view of the Fourth Circuit, Peti tioner lost his

20

right to appeal that order denying a jury trial on the

21

first day of trial when that demand was extinguished and

22

interlocutory appeal.

2

Such an order would now fall within the confines

3

of the Cohen doctrine, addressed by this Court in Lauro

4

Lines v . Chasser and Midland Asphalt.

5

this Court for well over 100 years, as we discuss in our

6

brief, and that of all other circuits, has been to reverse

7

and remand upon a finding that the denial of the jury

8

trial right was erroneous.

9

done, in effect, is to create a new category of

What the Fourth Circuit has

10

interlocutory appeals.

11

one had a right to appeal that denial at the conclusion of

12

the proceeding.

13

Until now, one would have thought,

Indeed, if Petitioner had taken an interlocutory

14

appeal, under its prevailing view, it is likely that such

15

an appeal would have been dismissed.

16

could have proceeded by mandamus, but

QUESTION:

MS. REED:

Well, either that or because it now

HS. REED:

prevailing view of the law, had he attempted to take an

3

interlocutory appeal, that appeal would probably have been

4

dismissed because it was thought the jury trial orders

5

were not appealable until the conclusion of the trial.

6

QUESTION:

I see.

7

HS. REED:

Now, Petitioner certainly could have

8

proceeded by mandamus, but he was not required to do so at

9

peril of forfeiting his right to ever appeal the denial of

10

the jury trial.

11

That has simply never been the law.

Now, the court of appeals did this under an

12

erroneous view of collateral estoppel.

13

estoppel is not like law of the case, which is used to

14

maintain consistency during the proceedings of a single

15

case.

16

of a single proceeding .

17

direct appeal.

18

estoppel on direct appeal to preclude review of an

19

obviously erroneous order is simply unprecedented.

Now, collateral, by its terms, would appear to

mean a separate proceeding.

What the court of appeals

22

seems to have done is some sort of new kind of estoppal

that one might appropriately term bootstrap estoppal.

24

Petitioners cannot correct the denial of the jury trial,

25

according to Respondent, because the district court made

right, that because the district court proceeded to make

findings after his error, Petitioner cannot get review of

that .

•

It ends up meaning that two wrongs may make a

Now the consequence of this ruling is that a

7

party must seek and be granted interlocutory review of all

8

rulings that might possibly infringe on a right to the

9

jury trial.

Now that is contrary to the Federal system as

10

we know it, and it would be highly disruptive.

It would, to the contrary, generate additional litigation,

generate additional appeals, because it would force

counsel to take protective appeals.

Now, Respondents secondly argue that because the

19

court would have directed a verdict for Respondent, a

20

remand in this case is not required.

21

response to that is that is not what the court of appeals

22

held in this case.

23

no reasonable jury would ever hold for Petitioner, or

24

could ever hold for Petitioner.

MS. REED:

3

Parklane, it is a very different case, Justice Kennedy.

said about the background facts in the case, but we don't

3

believe there is any disagreement about what Mr. Lytle's

4

claims are, and we feel that the claims themselves are

Lytle claims that he was discriminated against because of

Next, Mr. Lytle claims that he was retaliated

against or discriminated against because he filed an EEOC

charge when the company gave out references to perspective

14

employers that included only the job title and length of

15

employment.

QUESTION:

This is a ground that you think you

are entitled to press as a respondent?

MR. DENNARD:

Well, this is

16

Patterson was decided after that, but it is our position

coverage of Section 1981, so that we can make this

19

argument at this stage.
QUESTION:

You argued it before the Fourth

Circuit?
MR. DENNARD:

We argued before the Fourth

23

Circuit and in the district court that -- that the

24

retaliation claim -- it's a little bit different argument

25

with both claims.

But with the retaliation argument, we

They -- I think

Would the relief you get under --

under your Patterson theory be precisely the same as the

relief that you are seeking to defend?

retaliation would be the same.

5

majority of cases that have considered it in the lower

6

courts.

7

Eleventh Circuits have all applied Patterson retroactively

8

to pending claims at this point in time.

The Sixth, the Seventh, the Ninth and the

10

and the Ninth Circuit opinion in our brief, and the

11

Eleventh Circuit decision in McGinnis v. Ingrahm Equipment

13

of Patterson to a pending case and considered the

14

plaintiff's argument in that case that Patterson couldn't

15

be raised because it hadn't been perfected on appeal.

16

the Eleventh Circuit concluded that Patterson would have

17

to be considered because it actually restricted the

subject matter of the court to consider claims under

19

Section 1981.

And if you are

on, you really have to show us some reason why we ought

2

not to reach that question, don't you?

3

MR. DENNARD:

Well, the point -- the reason not

4

to reach that question is because it, you have to consider

5

a constitutional question there.

6

QUESTION:

What is the constitutional question?

7

MR. DENNARD:

The constitutional question is the

8

Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial.

9

question that was presented in the petition for

10
11

That's

the

certiorari, it was -- that's the way it was grounded.
QUESTION:

But I -- the Seventh Amendment,

12

obviously, is a provision of the Constitution, and it

13

guarantees the right to jury trial in a civil case.

14

what we are talking about here is how a decision claimed

15

to have wrongfully denied that right should be reviewed,

16

and collateral estoppel, and that's -- now, those aren't

17

necessarily constitutional questions.

18

MR. DENNARD:

But

Well, that is the view that we've

19

taken, and that's the grounds for the Court considering.

20

And of course the other basis is because we feel like we

21

have raised the issue and the record is adequately

22

developed so that we can have the issue considered under -

23

- under those principles.

6

QUESTION:

Even if you are right about the, this

7

being a constitutional claim that the petitioner has

8

raised, I don't think that the avoidance of constitutional

9

claims is something that we pay much attention to and a

10

question where we have granted certiorari on the question.

11

We could grant certiorari on a very important

12

constitutional question that we think there is a conflict

in the circuits on that needs decided.

QUESTION:

Mr. Dennard, the petitioner argues in

7

a brief that he was wrongfully denied a promotion,

8

discriminatorily denied.

9

Patterson as a Sec t ion 1981 claim?

10

MR. DENNARD:

Now, would that survive

Under -- of course, under the

11

reasoning in Patterson, some promotion decisions would be

12

subject to coverage .

13

issue has really been preserved up the line.

14

the Court really considered the question of the overlap

15

coverage between Section 1981 and Title VII and concluded

16

that there could be a rational, common sense

17

interpretation of the language of Section 1981 to make and

18

enforce contracts that would yield an interpretation that

19

wouldn't frustrate the congressional objective to the

20

preference of conciliation over litigation in Title VII

21

cases.

22

But I don't think the promotion
In Patterson

And with the -- they looked at the -- the court

2

imposition of discriminatory working conditions.

right to enforce contracts, on the other hand, would

extend to the legal process and protection of the legal

process.

6

The

So our position on the Patterson case would be

7

that we would urge the Court to apply Patterson in this

8

case to uphold the dismissal of both the retaliation and

9

the discharge claims, because this is post-formation

conduct.

The discharge is obviously post-formation

11

conduct.

It actually involves the discriminatory

application of rules.

14

discriminatory working conditions, harassment, sweeping

15

the floor and this type thing.

16

QUESTION:

It's very analogous to the

I wonder if it wouldn't be advisable

17

to let that question, the extent to which Patterson

governs these particular claims, go back to the lower

question we thought we were going to deal with on

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JUDITH REED

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. REED:

Respondent urges that this Court

6

avoid a constitutional issue by deciding on the Patterson

7

grounds.

8

Justice on this question.

9

estoppal rule will prevail and a determination as to when

10

a petitioner may appeal the denial -- the wrongful denial

11

of a jury trial, does not depend on the -- the fact that

12

the jury trial right stems from the Constitution.

13

issue would be the same whether it was a statutory right

14

to a jury trial or that it came from the Seventh

15

Amendment.

16

important, and the Court ought to decide the issue upon

17

which it granted cert.

18

Now, on that matter we agree with the Chief

vindication here we have denied you your constitutional

constitutional right is involved?
MS. REED:

Well, oh -- the constitutional right

to a jury trial is implicated here.

My point is that the

the decision that this Court must make as to the

5

collateral estoppal issue doesn't turn on that.

6

believe that --

7

QUESTION:

We

Well, no -- I mean, suppose we said

8

collateral estoppel is perfectly fine.

Wouldn't we -- as

9

a matter of statutory law and common law, wouldn't we then

10

have to say but, in this area of the Sixth Amendment,

11

isn't there some special restriction upon it?

12

am just not sure I agree with you that you can possibly

13

avoid saying that we have to ultimately say would it

14

violate the Sixth Amendment for us to apply collateral

15

estoppel here.

16

MS. REED:

I mean, I

Well, I think what the court did

17

constitutes a violation of the Seventh Amendment, don't

18

get me wrong.

19

appeal a wrongful denial does not turn on whether the, the

20

jury trial right stems from the Constitution.

21

don't think you -- the necessity for avoidance of a

22

constitutional -- deciding on a consti tutional issue is

23

really implicated here.

that retaliation is not covered under 1981, for the

This record is not in the condition for this

Court to resolve the Patterson question.

What Patterson

9

means is that there are fact-specific issues that would be

10

appropriately redressed, addressed on remand, including

11

retroactivity and including whether discharge and

12

retaliation are within the scope.

13

As Justice White pointed out, if we had by-

14

passed Title VII and sued only under Section 1981,

15

Respondent would concede that the denial of a jury trial

16

would have been reversible error.

17

Court should adopt a collateral estoppel rule that

18

encourages or perhaps even requires a by-passing of Title

19

VII remedies.

20

We don't think the

Finally, Respondents urge that no remand is

21

necessary because of the directed verdict possibility.

22

Now, certainly on remand, whether a directed verdict is

23

appropriate can also be considered.
