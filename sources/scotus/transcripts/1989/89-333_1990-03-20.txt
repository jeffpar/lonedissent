ORAL ARGUMENT OF RODERICK E. WALSTON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. WALSTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

11

The question presented in this case is whether state

12

water laws apply to hydropower projects that are licensed

13

by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, as

14

it is commonly known.

15

The case involves a dispute between California and

16

FERC over minimum flows for the Rock Creek project out in

17

California.

18

requirements for the project than those imposed by FERC.

19

California has established higher flow

FERC makes the argument in this case that the Federal

20

Power Act completely preempts state flow requirements.

21

California argues that Section 27 of the Federal Power Act

22

authorizes the state to set its own flow requirements.

23

California's position in this case, I might add, is

24

supported literally by all 49 sister states.

25

Section 27 provides on its face that the Federal

1

Power Act does not interfere with state laws relating to

2

control, appropriation, use or distribution of water used

3

in irrigation or for municipal or other uses, or any

4

vested right acquired therein.

5

California's flow requirements in this case relate to

6

control, appropriation and use of water for other uses,

7

mainly in-stream uses and also hydropower uses.

8

under California law, in-stream fish flows are

9

specifically defined as a beneficial use of water.

Indeed,

And

10

therefore, Section 27 literally encompasses the California

11

flow requirements in this case.

12

The legislative history we believe makes especially

13

clear that Congress intended to defer to the states

14

preeminent water rights authority and to preserve the

15

state's existing traditional water right laws.

16

Congress indeed has traditionally deferred the

17

state's water laws, and in passing the Federal Power Act,

18

and particular Section 27, Congress intended to continue

19

the same tradition of deference that has been followed in

20

the past.

21

Congress specifically intended for hydropower projects to

22

comply with state water laws to the same extent that other

23

persons must comply.

24
25

And that legislative history indicates that

Congressman Doremus stated during their legislative
debates,

"Water power companies organized under this act

1

will be obliged to be obliged to operate under state law."

2

Congressman Mondell stated that the bill disclaims any

3

intent to take over control of water from the states.

4

No congressman during the legislative debates offered

5

any different interpretation of Section 27 or suggested

6

that the hydropower projects are not required

7

with state water laws.

QUESTION:

to comply

Well, literally I take it you would say

then that the state would have the authority — the
authority to require a license from the state.
MR. WALSTON:

Yes, that is correct.

And our position

is that —

13

QUESTION:

Even though it's licensed by the —

14

MR. WALSTON:

By the — by FERC under the Federal

15

Power Act.

16

by Congress is this.

17

to issue licenses for hydropower projects and requires

18

those hydropower projects to comply with FERC-imposed

19

terms and conditions.

20

Yes, that is correct.

QUESTION:

The scheme established

Section 4 of the Act authorizes FERC

Well, Mr. Claps, what's — what has been

21

happening as a practical matter in the years since the

22

First Iowa decision?

23

licenses of these hydroelectric projects that are

24

authorized by the Federal government?

25

MR. WALSTON:

Have any states been requiring

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

As a matter of

1

fact there are 492 hydropower projects now in California

2

that have acquired water rights under state water law or

3

in the process of -- of acquiring such rights.

4

this case, no hydropower project in California has

5

challenged the validity of California law as applied to

6

that project.

7

And until

And therefore, the on the ground status quo is that

8

hydropower projects are in fact complying with both

9

Federal law and state law.

They are getting licenses from

10

FERC and also getting permits from the state.

11

actual on the ground reality that is occurring today --

12

13
14

QUESTION:

And have minimum flow requirements been

imposed by the state since First Iowa?
MR. WALSTON:

The states, especially in California,

15

routinely impose minimum flow requirements.

16

common —

17

That is the

QUESTION:

That is a

And if those minimum flow requirements

18

make the project economically infeasible, as is alleged

19

here, that's all right?

20

MR. WALSTON:

That is correct.

That's the scheme

21

envisioned by Congress, Justice O'Connor.

The idea that

22

Congress had in mind was that hydropower projects had to

23

get joint approval.

24

under Section 4 of the Federal Power Act.

25

to get approval from the state, pursuant to Section 27 of

They had to get approval from FERC

They also had

the Federal Power Act.
Thereby, the — what Congress had in mind was that

3

you had — that the hydropower project has to go both

4

through the Federal process and the state process and has

5

to comply with the conditions and requirements both as —

6

as a condition of operation.

7

QUESTION:

Do you think that's the — the language

8

and understanding of First Iowa, which seemed to take a

9

very restrictive view of the meaning of this particular

10
11

provision?
MR. WALSTON:

Well, first, in First Iowa, we think

12

that the Court's discussion of Section 27, Justice

13

O'Connor, was dictum.

14

QUESTION:

Well, I know you think that.

15

MR. WALSTON:

16

QUESTION:

Because the —

But, let's -- let's look at what the Court

17

said, nonetheless, and didn't the Court at least

18

articulate a very restrictive view of the meaning of the

19

Section?

20

MR. WALSTON:

Yes, it did.

And if this Court were to

21

sustain the First Iowa court's analysis of Section 27,

22

then we could not prevail here.

23

court's interpretation in First Iowa of Section 27 has

24

been undermined by this Court's more recent decision in

25

California v. United States.

Our view is that the

QUESTION:

1
2

Moreover, you're telling me that nobody's

been paying any attention to it.
MR. WALSTON:

3

The reality is that hydropower projects

4

have in fact complied with both Federal water law and

5

state water law.

6

done it is because the state water laws have always been

7

deemed to apply to hydropower projects to the same extent

8

as apply to everyone else.
QUESTION:

9

And probably the reason why they have

And another reason is it was perfectly

10

feasible and easy to do so.

11

this case is to comply with the — with the state law, at

12

least allegedly, would amount to a veto of this project.
MR. WALSTON:

13
14

But the point of it here in

Well, we — we don't believe that

that's the case, Justice White.

15

QUESTION:

I know, but I said arguably.

16

MR. WALSTON:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. WALSTON:

Okay, well --

Let's assume that it would.
Okay.

If — yes.

Certainly First Iowa

19

said in analyzing Section 27 that the states could not

20

impose any kind of condition that would veto a project.

21

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.

22

MR. WALSTON:

Our view in this case is that the

23

Court's decision in First Iowa — the analysis of Section

24

27 —

Would allow the state to have a veto.

MR. WALSTON:

QUESTION:

5

Would allow the state to have a veto.

And that is — I think that's your

outright argument in your brief.
MR. WALSTON:

Yes, that's correct.

We also argue

that the state is not imposing a veto in this case.

6

QUESTION:

I know.

7

MR. WALSTON:

The state has simply imposed

8

conditions that require the project to meet higher flow

9

requirements than those contained in the FERC license.

10

QUESTION:

Well, now what — what do we know about

11

the effect of those higher flow requirements imposed by

12

the state on the feasibility of this project?

13

MR. WALSTON:

I don't think — as far as I know,

14

Justice — or Mr. Chief Justice, I don't believe that

15

there's any evidence in the record concerning the effect

16

of these conditions on economic feasibility.

17

that FERC, in it's declaratory order, stated that the

18

project would be economically feasible over the life of

19

the project, but not during the middle years of the

20

project under the state conditions.

21

that there is any evidence in the record offered by any

22

parties concerning that question.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

I do recall

But I don't think

Well — evidence or not, the court of

appeals thought that it would amount to a veto.
MR. WALSTON:

Well, yes, the court of appeals said

1

that potentially that could happen.

2

think there is any evidence in the record whatsoever to

3

support the court of appeal analysis on that question.

4

I — I — I don't

Once again, I stress that the idea that Congress had

5

in mind in 1920 was that the water project would have to

6

go both through the Federal process and the state process.

7

And indeed this was FERC's historic interpretation of the

8

meaning of Section 27.
QUESTION:

10

What — what state laws do you think are

affected by the Federal Power Act?

11

MR. WALSTON:

12

QUESTION:

13

What's — I — do —

What state laws are preempted by the

Federal Power Act?

14

MR. WALSTON:

In our view the — the state laws that

15

would be preempted are those that are in contrary --

16

contrary to clear congressional directives.

words, directives espoused by Congress.

take that —

MR. WALSTON:

And the reason we

Such — such as?
Well, I — as I recall, I think there

21

is a provision in the Federal Power Act for example that

prohibits monopolies or restraints of trade.

there is an anti-monopoly provision in the Federal Power

Act.

it?
MR. WALSTON:

Section 27 on its face would.

California v. United States, this Court said that state

power under Section 8 is limited by clear congressional

directives.

We assume that the —

QUESTION:

Well, that's — that's all First Iowa, I

suppose, meant that if — if Congress clearly authorized

10

the FERC to — to build a project, the state couldn't

11

prevent it.

12

MR. WALSTON:

I — I think that's clearly the

13

expectation of Congress.

14

legislative debate was this.

15

16

the hydropower project had to go both through the state

And thus the expectation of Congress was that

QUESTION:

How do — how do you describe under

6

California law the state's interest here?

7

ownership of the water, or is there some descriptive term

8

for the use of that water for the promotion of fishing?

9

MR. WALSTON:

Simply that

There's specific statutes that protect

10

the public interest in water for in-stream uses, and

11

particularly for the protection of fish, Justice Kennedy.

12

Section 1243 and 1257 of the California Water Code

13

specifically provide that the State Water Resources

14

Control Board must consider, and to the extent necessary

15

protect, fish needs.

16

board must balance fish needs against the needs of

17

hydropower projects as well.

18

QUESTION:

And it also provides that the state

If — if you have a riparian owner who

19

wishes to use the water, and the state has an interest in

20

preserving fishing, does that come out of the public trust

doctrine or just —

22

MR. WALSTON:

No, it, comes — the riparian doctrine

23

has been so modified in California now that the same

24

conditions that apply to appropriated use also apply to

25

riparian use as well.

And therefore, it wouldn't make any

difference
QUESTION:

All right.

Suppose then you had an

3

appropriated user?

4

appropriated use seemed to conflict wish fishery

5

requirement?

6

interest?

7

And that — and that prior

Then how would you characterize the state

MR. WALSTON:

Well, the state interest in that case

8

would be to reassess the appropriated right in order to

9

protect the fish needs to the extent that the state

10

determines that fish needs have to be protected under

11

those circumstances.

12

Of course, it's always a balance.

The State of

13

California is not in the business of putting hydropower

14

development out of business in order to protect fish.

15

QUESTION:

But, what about putting hydropower

16

development into business?

17

uses are covered by this provision, surely the generation

18

of power is an in-stream use?

19

MR. WALSTON:

20

QUESTION:

If you assert that in-stream

That's right.

So, I presume then, if you read this

21

Section 27 the way you read it, California can license a

22

hydroelectric plant that does not have the approval of

23

FERC because it says nothing herein shall be construed to

24

affect or intended to affect in any way, or in any way

MR. WALSTON:

MR. WALSTON:

QUESTION:

MR. WALSTON:

That is correct.

But the project couldn't operate.

Why?
Because it — it wouldn't have the FERC

You don't need the FERC license.

It says

California says you can -- you can operate a hydroelectric

If you were to read Section 27 in the

Section 27 from Section 8.

States this Court held that Section 8 requires the

In that case, the Solicitor General made the same

argument on Section 8 that he makes today on Section 27.

He argued that Section 8 is limited simply to proprietary

rights.

that argument would trivialize — and that was the Court's

MR. WALSTON:

Yes, the — the State of Iowa in the

First Iowa case argued that Section 9(b) of the Federal

3

Power Act requires the hydropower project to go to the

provision.

licensing process.

10

It has no force and effect.

It simply gives

And therefore, the Court said you don't have to get a

11

state water right as a condition precedent to getting a

FERC license.

First Iowa.

14

That's what the Court actually held in

Now, that holding could be correct, and indeed we do

15

not challenge it here, and the Court could still sustain

16

California's position here, because in First Iowa the

17

Court did not consider — or I should say anything that it

18

did consider concerning the effect of Section 27 was

19

extraneous to the decision and, therefore, in our view was

20

dictum.

21

Now certainly the Court had a very crabbed view of

22

Section 27 in the First Iowa case.

23

that crabbed view is inconsistent with the broad view that

this Court took of Section 8 in the case of California v.

the other, it is simply incomprehensible that the Court

2

should interpret those statutes inconsistently.

3

QUESTION:

Why do you say it was dictum in -- in --

4

MR. WALSTON:

Well, because the actual holding in

5

First Iowa was that Section 9(b) of the act simply imposed

6

an informational requirement only and, therefore, that

7

Section 9(b) in itself did not require a hydropower

8

project to obtain a state water right as a condition

9

precedent to getting a FERC license.

10

And that was the whole holding that — that — that

11

was the question that First Iowa put before the Court and

12

that was the holding of the Court.

13

said on Section 27 was extraneous to its decision.

MR. NIGHTINGALE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In the Federal Power Act Congress has delegated to

4

the Commission responsibility for licensing those

5

hydroelectric projects that in the Commission's judgment

6

are best adapted to the development of the waterways in

7

issue.

8

9

In each such licensing, the Commission weighs a
variety of interests, including the requirements of

10

interstate and foreign commerce, irrigation, navigation,

11

the environment and many others.

12

The question presented by this case is when the

13

Commission has undertaken that task, balanced those

14

interests and issued a license, Section 27 reserves to the

15

states authority to prevent the judgment from being put

16

into effect.

17

Now, our fundamental contention is that this Court

18

has reached and resolved that question in, among other

19

cases, the First Iowa case and Federal Power Commission v.

20

Oregon, the Pelton Dam case.

21

laws were asserted that would have blocked hydroelectric

22

projects that had been licensed by FERC, or in the —

23

excuse me, in the First Iowa case the Commission had

state laws could not be applied to veto the implementation

2

of the project.
QUESTION:

3

Mr. Nightingale, is it the government's

4

position here that the state cannot impose any

5

requirements that the FERC doesn't, even though the

6

requirement wouldn't constitute a veto?
MR. NIGHTINGALE:

7

Your Honor, our position is that

8

the state cannot impose conditions that are inconsistent

9

with the license terms.

Now, in this case the Commission

10

has explained how its minimum flow requirements implement

11

a balance between, on the one hand the requirements of

12

power generation, and on the other hand the protection of

13

fish.

14

And it has explained that in-stream flow requirements

15

different from those established are inconsistent with

16

those of the state.

17

cannot impose conflicting conditions.

QUESTION:

So, our position is that the state

requirement which didn't conflict?
MR. NIGHTINGALE:

If it -- if there were no conflict

it would be our position that it would not be preempted.

23

Assuming it was -- that would be our position, yes.

Or other uses.

I thought your position

MR. NIGHTINGALE:

Our position is that Section 27

expressly saves state law from preemption.

words, if the state law is one that falls within Section

12

27, it's saved.

it really doesn't make a lot of difference to us, and then

the state came along and set a smaller minimum flow.

And the Commission can say, well, that really won't

project.

7

Now, is that — is the state preempted there?

process works is to channel state concerns through the

licensing process.

it wasn't prescriptive in any sense, I suppose there would

be room for the states to do different things.

— at every stage of the proceeding it relied on the

argument that the requirement for compliance was

preempted.

and resolved three propositions I believe.
First, it analyzed the structure of the Act as a

3

whole and reached the conclusion that the entire scheme

4

was designed to place in the Commission responsibility for

5

resolving the issue presented by the licensing statute.

6

Second, it found that Section 9(b) did not save state

7

laws, did not — despite the inference that could be drawn

8

from the remainder of the statute, Section did — B did

9

not preserve the enforceability of — of the state law.

10

And finally, it reached and addressed the argument

11

presented by the State of — Iowa in that case that

12

Section 27 independently saved the state law, and it

13

discussed the scope of Section 27, both in response to

14

Iowa's assertion and because it was necessary to the

15

judgment in the case.

16

the Court couldn't very well find the state statute

17

preempted without considering whether Section 27 saved it.

18

Aware that Section 27 was there,

Now, any -- any doubt on that score, we submit, was

19

laid to rest in the Pelton Dam case.

In that case, one of

20

the requirements that the applicant for a license had not

21

complied with was a state statute that required a license

22

to appropriate water for the dam.

23

had held in that case that the FERC could issue only a

24

permissive license, not a license that would confer a

25

complete right to build the dam.

Under Section

satisfactory evidence with respect to compliance with

that category of state law that is saved as an entirely

plausible and entirely reasonable provision that has

believe that we are entitled to win this case.

California, one looks to identify a clear congressional

9

directive and then recognizes that section — that a

savings clause will not be deemed to supersede it.
Now, there's nothing in California that suggests that

a clear congressional directive must take a prescriptive,

clear form such as no more than 160 acres, which was the

issue in the Ivanhoe case.

16

responsibility to a Federal agency to make a particular

action itself.

20

We believe that Congress can

Let me suggest a — an example that may clarify the

21

point.

In the Fresno case the Court noted that the

22

savings clause would not save state law, which granted a

23

priority to municipal uses of water.

24

the Reclamation Act required the Secretary to provide --

25

to favor irrigation and to provide water for municipal use

The Court noted that

1

only when he first determined that it would not undercut

2

the use of a project for irrigation purposes.

3

Let's suppose that instead that statute had said that

4

the Secretary shall have authority to provide water which

5

in his judgment is best adapted — to those uses that in

6

his judgment would best adapt the project to a

7

comprehensive plan for the distribution of water for

8

irrigation, power, navigation, interstate commerce and

9

other beneficial uses.

We submit that that affirmative

10

grant of authority would qualify as a express

11

congressional directive, a clear congressional directive.

12

It's clear why Congress had to proceed by that means

in the Federal Power Act.

from the savings clause.

QUESTION:

But our

But you would not distinguish the two

7

cases on the basis of the nature of the conditions which

8

the state sought to attach?

9

MR. NIGHTINGALE:

No.

And let me emphasize three

10

things about the delegation that we believe underscore the

11

importance of respecting Congress' choice of that term.

12

First of all, it's an affirmative delegation.

13

Congress in this case has not given the Commission the job

14

of certifying compliance with certain minimum standards.

15

Its job under Section 10(a) of the Act is to determine

16

whether the project is best adapted to a variety of

17

interests.

18

affirmative judgment, and we think that that phrasing

19

suggests that it must have meant that when the Commission

20

determined what was best, that would be put into effect.

21

Secondly, the matters committed to the Commission's

And that's a — a — it's supposed to make an

22

judgment are comprehensive.

23

24

relevant to the public interest.

25

that there is -- that what -- when it's done that

In the words of this Court in

The strong suggestion is

1

properly, disputes with state authority will take the form

2

of differing judgments about matters that have been

3

committed to the Commission's judgment.

4

And we believe that, again, there's another -- that's

5

another very strong indication that Congress must have

6

meant its judgments to be implemented -- the Commission's

7

judgments to be implemented.

8

Finally, the Commission's judgment encompasses

9

matters of national and regional scope, matters that may

10

not be fully reflected in state law, in particular

11

interstate and foreign commerce and navigability and, in

12

the background, the nation's need for renewable resources

13

of energy as opposed to coal and oil-fired plants.

14

Again, those three characteristics of the delegation

15

to the Commission — its affirmative nature, its

16

comprehensive nature and its national nature — are very

17

strong indication that Congress meant for what the

18

Commission judged to be best would be put into effect.

IS

And in considering that I think that it's important

20

as well to remember that while this particular project

21

involves a relatively small stream in California, that the

22

Act as a whole applies nationwide to projects of a much

23

greater scope.

The Ohio River crosses

issues.

So, I — I — when — when construing the

10

statute, trying to determine the relationship within the

11

overall scheme of the Commission's licensing authority and

12

Section 27, it's important to recognize that the

13

accommodation will apply across the board, not just to

14

relatively small projects.

15

The suggestion that it is available to the Court to

16

disavow the dictum in First Iowa I think understates the

17

nature of the change in law that would be necessary to

18

adopt California's position in this case.

19

As I've indicated, I believe that the Federal Power

decision that every Federal hydropower project is required

Finally, I'd like to follow through on the point that

2

Justice O'Connor raised about the status quo.

I think

3

there is a -- there would be a significant -- that a

4

decision in effect overruling First Iowa subordinating

5

Federal hydropower projects to all state water law would

6

have a significant impact in three significant respects.

7

First, in 1986 Congress passed a statute, the

8

Environmental Consumer — I mean Electrical Consumers

9

Protection Act, which reinforced the Commission's

10

responsibility to consider and address environmental

11

issues in its licenses.

12

Under that statute, the Congress created procedures

13

whereby concerns about the environment would be funneled

14

through the licensing process.

15

to solicit recommendations from state and Federal agencies

16

with wildlife concerns.

17

state plans for comprehensive development in its licensing

18

decisions.

19

The Commission is required

It's also required to consider

The very clear implication of that legislation is

20

that the Commission was to have the final say, with the

21

benefit of the views of the states.

22

states could implement their own policy choices through

state water law would seriously undercut that scheme, we

submit.

that would limit its interpretation to those state water

2

laws that apply at the threshold of a hydroelectric

3

project.

4

right now that have been licensed, we believe, on the

5

assumption that First Iowa was good law.

There are a number of projects in operation

6

California, among other states, have begun to revise

7

state water law to permit changes in water appropriations

8

after an initial license or permission to use water has

9

been granted under the public trust doctrine.

10

We believe that there would be considerable

11

uncertainty engendered if California's view were adopted

12

and that body of state law were potentially applicable to

13

licensed existing projects.

14

Finally, projects are relicensed on a regular basis.

15

Licenses are issued for terms of up to 50 years but a

16

number of major projects come up for renewal on a regular

17

basis, and we believe that the result for which California

18

argues in this case could have a serious unsettling effect

19

on those procedures as well.

MR. WALSTON:

Some comments, Mr. Chief Justice.

I

2

understood the Solicitor General to say that the FERC

3

licenses — the hydropower components of Federal projects.

4

And if that's what he said, that is not correct.

5

Indeed, FERC has no jurisdiction over the hydropower

6

component of Federal projects.

But on the other hand,

7

under this Court's decision in California v. United

8

States, the states do have jurisdiction over hydropower

9

components of the Federal projects.

Thus the FERC

10

argument in this case means in effect that the state can

11

regulate the hydropower component of Federal projects, but

12

not of private projects.

13

And this doesn't make any sense to us at all.

As a

14

matter of fact the Federal project has much deeper Federal

15

interest connected with it then the private project, where

16

the Federal projects that state law is applied to under

17

California v. United States are authorized by Congress,

18

built and operated by Federal agencies, funded by the

19

American taxpayer.

20

The hydropower projects here, on the other hand, are

21

built, financed and operated by private entities.

22

therefore, the Federal interest is much more involved with

23

respect to Federal project than the private one.

Justice Kennedy had in mind in his question to the
