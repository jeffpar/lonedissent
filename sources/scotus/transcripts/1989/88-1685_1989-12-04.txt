ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID L. SHAPIRO

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. SHAPIRO:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The facts of the issue of this case may be

12

simply stated.

13

of an economic strike, the employer withdrew recognition

14

from the duly certified union.

15

bargaining unit consisted of 49 employees; 25 of these

16

employees were permanent replacements who had been hired

17

by the employer during the economic strike, and who had

18

crossed the picket line to get to work.

19

On July 20, 1979, four days after the end

At that time, the

The National Labor Relations Board said that

20

that fact, coupled with certain other facts -- i.e., the

21

record -- did not suffice to create an objective basis to

22

establish a good faith doubt on the employer's part that

23

the union still enjoyed majority support.

24

withdrawal of recognition was an unfair labor practice, a

25

failure to bargain in good faith under Section 8(a)(5).

Therefore, the

The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit

1
2

denied enforcement of this order.

3

appeals opinion was its determination that the Board was

4

required to adopt the so-called Gorman presumption, that

5

it was compelled to infer that the permanent replacements

6

who had been hired during the strike would not -- did not

7

and would not support the union, that therefore there was

8

a sufficient objective basis to support the employer's

9

withdrawal of recognition.
QUESTION:

10

The key to the court of

Mr. Shapiro, do you think that the

11

Board could have given any evidentiary value to the fact

12

that it was replacement workers who were working?

13

not required to.

14

evidentiary weight to that fact?

15

MR. SHAPIRO:

Maybe

Do you think the Board could give some

Your Honor, I think two things are

17

evidence as irrelevant.

18

which the Board makes its judgment.

19

cases where that factor along with other significant

20

factors have counted.

One is that the Board does not exclude that

MR. SHAPIRO:

I think it is a relevant fact, and

2

that in certain circumstances it may well make a

3

difference, but that it has —

4

QUESTION:

What else is necessary?

5

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, there is, at the moment, I

6

think, an ongoing dialogue between the Board and the

7

courts of appeals on exactly what is required.

8

significant cases during the 1980s were the IT Services

9

case and the Stormer case in the Board, in which there had

Two

10

been significant number of permanent replacements hired.

11

Some of those replacements had individually expressed

12

opposition to the union.

13

amount of violence on the picket line.

14

insistent union demands that the replacements be

15

themselves fired and that the strikers be reinstated.

16

There — those were situations in which the Board held

17

that a good faith doubt had been established.

18

QUESTION:

There had been a significant
There had been

Mr. Shapiro, I can under — it is the

19

Board's rule that a good faith doubt suffices.

20

understand the Board saying we no longer want that rule.

21

But the Board has adhered to that rule, that a good faith

22

doubt suffices.

23

how whether or not a good faith doubt reasonably must be

24

thought to exist is a question of law.

25

question of fact.

That is a matter of law.

Now, I can

But I don't see

I mean, it's a

1

when you have a union striking, demanding that their

2

people be brought back and that the scabs, which they

3

refer to them as, that the employer has hired, be

4

dismissed, it seems — how can you possibly say that the

5

employer doesn't have a good faith doubt whether these

6

scabs want to join the union?

7

you want to abolish the good faith doubt rule, that is one

8

thing.
MR. SHAPIRO:

9

It boggles the mind.

If

Your Honor, I think I would like

10

to do two things in response to that question.

11

all, to note that it is not always true that unions are

12

demanding right up to the point that recognition be

13

withdrawn, that the replacements themselves be discharged.

14

I (inaudible) of the Dold case, which is one of the cases

15

recently decided by the Board.

16

withdrew recognition from the union, the union had

17

acknowledged that, I think, something like 170 of the 200

18

replacements were entitled to the jobs, were not to be

19

replaced.

20

First of

At the time the employer

So that situation varies from case to case.
In this case there is no record whatever of a

21

union demand that the replacements be fired.

22

simply an offer to return to work, an unconditional offer

23

to return to work.

didn't they?

MR. SHAPIRO:

3

I think they would have liked

that.
QUESTION:

Well, it's very hard to get your

4

members rehired if the people that have been brought in to

5

replace them are not told to leave.

6

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, in many situations, as Judge

7

Williams pointed out in the dissent below, the

8

accommodation that is reached is for the employer to take

9

back many or most of the strikers, although some have been

10

gone -- may have gone on to other jobs, to take back many

11

or most of the strikers, but to retain many or most of the

12

replacements, and then to rely on a process of attrition,

13

if the business is not expanding, to bring the work

14

complement back to what it was.

15

from case to case and from strike to strike.

16

QUESTION:

Those situations do vary

Not very much.

In fact, the Board

17

itself has said, hasn't it, that "strike replacements" can

18

reasonably foresee that if the union is successful the

19

strikers will return to work and the strike replacements

20

will be out of a job.

21

about the existence of a reasonable doubt on the part of

22

the employer.

23

Isn't that the — you're talking

This involves probabilities, doesn't it?

MR. SHAPIRO:

Your Honor, I don't -- but the

24

question here, I think, is not whether a Board decision to

25

adopt a presumption of this kind is correct and entitled

decision, for both reasons of policy and what it regards

as industrial realities, that, to regard such a

presumption as required, is reasonable and entitled to

deference.

6

doubt test is absolutely critical, I think, to an

7

understanding of this case.

8

understand what the nature of that good faith doubt test

9

is and how it originated.

10

The question is whether the Board's

11

employer may not do so if the union, the employer and the

2

bargaining unit still exist, may not do so during the

3

first year after certification, may not do so during the

4

normal term of a collective bargaining agreement, and may

5

not do so at other times, unless the employer may -- can

6

establish, as a matter of fact, that the union has lost

7

its majority or that there is a sufficient objective basis

8

for a good faith doubt.
Now, that last rule is sometimes referred to as

9
10

the rebuttable presumption of continuing majority support.

11

That has been in existence for over 50 years, and which

12

the courts, the lower courts and this Court, have

13

unanimously endorsed.

14

QUESTION:

Well, it couldn't have existed for 50

15

years, if the Board's old rule used to be that if the

16

bargaining unit now contains a majority of replacements,

17

that that establishes a good faith doubt.

18

MR. SHAPIRO:

Your Honor, I was backtracking to

19

the underlying rule that said that — that still says that

20

an employer may withdraw recognition only if he can

21

establish that the union no longer has a majority, or that

22

there is a sufficient objective basis for a good faith

doubt.

line, in terms of the kinds of demands the unions were

making.

3

Justice White, I think that the position of the

4

Board from the very beginning has been, indeed going back

5

to 1939 and '40, that the existence of employee turnover

6

is not in itself sufficient to rebut the presumption of

7

continued majority support.

That's a remarkable type of turnover.

said was that the policy reasons that underlie the

Board agrees on that, is to talk to workers, including

2

replacements, about the general conditions of employment,

3

something that the employer did do here, indeed talked to

15 of the replacements, and only one of them indicated

5

that he did not support the union as his representative.

So that the Board, it seems to me —

I know, but he -- he was just saying

MR. SHAPIRO:

On the present record, the Board

would not have ordered an election.

rule essentially is that an election may be held, a

protect the interests of the employees at all times?
MR. SHAPIRO:

12

I think the union's proposal in

this case, the amicus brief, is a stronger proposal, which

14

would be to eliminate altogether the ability of the

employer to withdraw recognition unilaterally.

But what about just, if it were just

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, of course the union proposal

19

is much stronger than that.

And I would say limiting the

20

union's ability to represent the employees to a 12-month

21

period would go against the indication of the act that the

22

union is normally entitled to continue representing the

23

employees until and unless they lose a decertification

QUESTION:

2

The -- the -Mr. Shapiro, you said in your brief

and you mentioned here as well, that the Board has

decided, that the policy reasons for keeping the union in

place are not dissipated by reason of the strike and

6

replacement.

7

its perception as to what the law should be, not an

8

evolution of its perception as to what the facts are.

9

seems to me that if the Board has that new policy

That may well be, but that's an evolution of

10

perception it could abandon its — its current rule that

the employer need not continue to recognize the union if

he has a reasonable doubt.

procedure.

15

Either adopt the procedure

But I don't see how the Board -- the Board can

prescribe facts.

17

seems to me that replacement of strikers either creates a

18

reasonable doubt or it doesn't create a reasonable doubt,

19

and if the Board says no it doesn't make it any less true.

20

It can prescribe law, but not facts.

MR. SHAPIRO:

I think those cases began to multiply in the

The Board had seen a variety of situations in

like IT Services and Stormer, involved considerable

violence, involved significant union demands for firing of

the replacements, involved other factors that indicated

shown.

Cases, however, arose in which there were no

20

in this case, there was very little activity on the picket

line, which dwindled practically to nothing, in which the

employer withdrew recognition not during the period of the

strike, but four days after the strike was over.

24

union demands, if they were made at all for firing the

replacements, were made only in terms of an offer of the

MR. CARROLL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Perhaps the most glaring defect in the Board's

13

Station KKHI rule is its failure to come to grips with the

14

evidence in this case that Curtin Matheson hired a new

15

work force of permanent replacement employees who never,

16

by word or deed, have expressed any interest whatsoever in

17

the incumbent union.

18

conflict, which the Board has recognized for decades to

19

exist in this situation, condemns as irrational the

20

Board's position in this case.

21

This, coupled with the inherent

As Justice Scalia observed in the, in one of the

22

cases in our brief, Leveld Wholesale, the Board

23

acknowledged that the replacement employees may reasonably

24

foresee that, if the union is successful, they are going

25

to be fired to make room for the returning strikers.

three years later.

And this is right,

The Board begins by aggregating cross-overs,

7

there were five in our case; strikers, there were 19 in

8

our case; and replacement employees, 25 in our case, for a

9

total of 49.

They start from the premise that we must

prove doubt as to 25, that is a simple majority of the 49.

11

The Board then analyzes the evidence, piece by piece, and

12

as to any employee with respect to whom the employer has

established fair doubt, that name is removed from the

replacements support the union, unless the Board or the

that doubt.

That would not serve the Board's

policy of industrial peace, which it has decided is better

MR. CARROLL:

Well, I -- first of all, I differ

6

with that view as to what, whether that is a good policy,

7

given that we have a new majority in the work force whose

8

Section 7 rights should be taken into account, and they

9

are not being taken into account under the Board's present

10

rule, because the Board rules in all cases that

replacement employees simply cannot be found to — doubt -

this rule.

devastating points which undercuts the Board's Station

KKHI rule is its inconsistency with not only this inherent

conflict which exists between strike replacements and the

Electric line of cases.

11

this line in our brief, as does the Chamber, the Chamber

12

devotes an entire section to this particular argument,

13

under Service Electric, because of this inherent conflict,

14

the Board has ruled that the union cannot represent the

15

replacement employees during the strike, because it has a

16

conflict of interest.

17

In fact, it is the union's goal, the Board reasons, to get

them fired.

19

In that line of cases, we cite

1

position in the Service Electric line of cases with its

2

position in Station KKHI, this Court does not owe

3

deference to the Board's decision.

4

Likewise, the Fansteel line of cases, which is a

5

case from this Court in 1938, and the Board argues that

6

because it is so old it doesn't apply here.

7

itself has applied that case all the way down through the

8

'70s in the Beacon Upholstery case.

9

But the Board

In these cases, the Board holds that it is

10

proper for an employer to withdraw recognition when he

11

hires permanent replacements for strikers who have been

12

lawfully discharged.

13

conceivable difference it could make if the — if the

14

strikers on the one hand are discharged and the

15

replacements are brought in for them, or whether the

16

strikers are on strike awaiting reinstatement.

17

And one wonders what the -- what

Indeed, I suggest that because the replacements

18

are on — excuse me, the strikers are on strike and

19

awaiting reinstatement, there is far more reason to

20

believe that, from the replacement standpoint, they are

21

more concerned about having the incumbent union bring

22

these people back than they would be in the case where the

again, the Board's decision is entitled to no deference.

2

But it's primary policy ground, that is, the

3

doomsday scenario that it posits, that once the employer

4

hires a sufficient number of replacements to outnumber the

5

strikers and cross-overs, the employer may withdraw

6

recognition and therefore disrupt bargaining stability.

7

That argument overstates the proposition, because all the

8

union needs to do is elect -- rather than file an unfair

9

labor practice charge and become mired in years of

10

litigation, all it has to do is file its petition for an

11

election.

I am sure the Board could very promptly convene

14

an election, determine the question whether the

15

replacement employees want the union, and if they do, then

16

the bargaining obligation attaches and, indeed, the union

17

has one year of protection, because of the one year

18

certification rule which we heard discussed here today,

19

within which to operate without fear of loss of majority.

20

There simply is no terminal point to bargaining as a

21

consequence of an employer raising a good faith doubt.

And we believe that the Board's statements to the Court to

the contrary are unfounded.

One point I think is very important to stress.

7

That the question in this case is not whether the Board

question whether the Board is required to infer that a

permanent replacement hired during an economic strike is
