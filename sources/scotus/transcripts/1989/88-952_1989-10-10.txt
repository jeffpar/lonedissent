ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT:
MR. WALLACE:

8

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
In this case, the court of appeals for the federal

11

circuit held unconstitutional an act of Congress, Section 502

12

of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, that requires, as

13

relevant here, the deduction and payment to the federal

14

treasury of one and a half percent of an award made by the

15

Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in favor of the United

16

States claimant, and paid out of the security account

17

established pursuant to the Algiers Accords that were

18

described in some detail in this Court's opinion in Dames &

19

Moore against Regan.

20

by the text of Section 502, and I am reading from page two of

21

the government's brief, to constitute reimbursement to the

22

United States government for expenses incurred in connection

23

with the arbitration of claims of the United States claimants

24

against Iran before the Tribunal, and the maintenance of the

25

security account.

The one and a half percent fee is stated

1

The statutory fee schedule not only was designed for

2

that purpose, as the legislative history corroborates, but our

3

experience to date has shown that the receipts from the fee in

4

the aggregate not only do not exceed the purpose for which the

5

fee was required, but, as we recount in some detail in our

6

reply brief, page 12, note 11, they cover only about one half

7

of the expenses of servicing the Tribunal and claimants before

government in negotiating the Algiers Accords themselves and

QUESTION:

So —

At what point, Mr. Wallace, do you get to

16

the point where it really wouldn't be permissible to attribute

17

these costs to —

18

MR. WALLACE:

Well, I am just — I think insofar as

19

they can be related to a benefit that is conferred upon the

20

special class of persons they could be included.

21

making the point, Mr. Chief Justice, that the costs are —

22

against which these fee receipts are being compared -- are

23

very conservatively calculated in showing benefits received by

24

complainants who use the Tribunal and the security account.

25

Because it is only the post negotiation maintenance of the

I am merely

1

Tribunal and security account that is taken into the

2

calculations.

3

There is no claim in this case that the award was an

4

inadequate payment of the claim.

Indeed, there is no basis

5

for such a claim in this case, because the award merely

6

effectuated the settlement between the parties that the

7

appellees agreed to, and the award was paid in full from the

8

security account.

9

facts of this case for the dis — the court of appeals

There is, accordingly, no basis in the

10

invocation of the concern expressed in Justice Powell's

11

separate opinion in partial dissent in Dames against Moore,

12

that perhaps some of the commercial claims of particular

13

Americans would be used as bargaining chips for foreign

14

relations purposes, for release of the hostages, et cetera.

15

Since -- and perhaps the security account would prove

16

inadequate to pay the claims in full, even if the award is
i

17
18

properly made by the Tribunal.
Nor, may I add, has experience in general with the

19

functioning of the Tribunal and the security account borne out

20

the concern that these claims might be sacrificed.

21

on page 21 of our brief, recounted that more than $1 billion

22

of payments have thus far been made out of the security

23

account to successful United States claimants, and that Iran

24

has replenished the security account on 21 occasions when its

25

balance fell below the $500 -- $500 million minimum that is,

We have,

1

that requires it under the Accords to replenish the account.

2

Thus far, it has been able to satisfy its obligations to

3

replenish the accounts --

4

QUESTION:

Well, that's not really this case, is it?

5

Sperry would say, I suppose, that we settled for a figure that

6

was satisfactory to us but then the government added on the

7

additional deduct, and that is what we are here to discuss.

8

MR. WALLACE:

9

QUESTION:

Exactly so.

And I would -- I don't think they concede

10

that the settlement was adequate if you take into account the

11

deduct.

12

I see nothing to that effect in the pleading.
MR. WALLACE:

Exactly so, Mr. Justice.

The challenge

13

here is solely to the one and a half percent fee rather than

14

to the award itself, but it is a fact that the award was made

15

by means of a negotiated settlement to which Sperry agreed,

16

and that at the time the award was submitted to the Tribunal

17

for its entry of an award and for payment of the fee, of the

18

award, out of the security account, Sperry knew that the

19

government had provided, through a treasury directive license,

20

that two percent of the award would be deducted.

21

there was a basis in the settlement negotiations for Sperry to

22

take into account the likelihood that a fee would be deducted.

23

QUESTION:

So that

Well, you could say that, though, about a 25

24

percent fee, that didn't purport to be equal to the cost.

25

was many times the cost.

It

You could say that Sperry knew about

1

that when it made the settlement, so perhaps it should have

2

gotten 25 percent more than it thought it should have.

3

MR. WALLACE:

Well, that is quite so, but the point

4

nonetheless is relevant to the foreseeability of what the

5

consequences of the settlement would be, and —

6

QUESTION:

Well, of course, I suppose Sperry could

7

foresee that that fee would be declared unconstitutional, or

8

unauthorized rather, by the United States claims court, so

9

that still brings us back to square one, it seems to me.

10

MR. WALLACE:

Since Sperry did not waive its right to

11

challenge the fee -- there is, however, Justice Kennedy,

12

another respect in which these aggregate figures are relevant

13

here, and that is that, as we have pointed out in our footnote

14

16, thus far Iran has managed to satisfy its obligations to

15

replenish the security account by means of payments out of an

16

escrow fund that has been created for the interest earned by

17

the security account.

18

Therefore, Iran is able to make payments from the

19

security account pursuant to awards entered by the Tribunal

20

without having to call upon any other funds.

21

these payments from funds that are not otherwise at its

22

disposal for any other purpose.

23

security account, pursuant to the awards, undoubtedly serves

24

as an inducement for Iran to settle and discharge claims

25

through that mechanism and through use of these funds that are

It can make

So that the existence of the

1

not otherwise available to it.

So there is, in that sense, a

2

benefit being conferred in the negotiating process itself by

3

the mere existence of the Accords and their implementing

4

mechanisms.
Now, the one and a half percent fee, as I have

5
6

recounted, constitutes what is known in the law as a user fee,

7

since it is reasonably calculated merely to defray the costs

8

of services being provided by the government for the special

9

benefit of a limited class of persons using those services.

10

This Court has on numerous occasions upheld the validity of

11

such a fee.

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, excuse me.

Do we know if

15

Sperry had any security — or had any other means by which it

16

could have effectuated its claim had the government not

17

entered into these international agreements and set up the

18

fund?

19

MR. WALLACE:

20

QUESTION:

Well, --

I mean it just seems to me a little bit

21

unreal to say, were I Sperry, I would feel a little bit

aggrieved when the government says you cannot pursue your

claims through normal legal means; we are going to erect a

barrier to that.

QUESTION:

Sperry had brought —

Attaching any of the assets of Iran in this

country and levying upon them.

6

MR. WALLACE:

Eleven months after the president froze

7

Iranian assets in this country, at a time when there was a

8

threat by Iran to withdraw all those assets, Sperry did attach

9

the assets.

But under this Court's holding in Dames and

10

Moore, that was entirely contingent and subordinate to the

11

orders of the president saying that, while such attachments

12

would be allowed, they could be nullified at any time, and the

13

assets could be moved out of the country.

14

that by the time Sperry brought its suit in the United States

15

courts, there would not have been any assets to attach.

16
17

QUESTION:

The likelihood is

Because of the government's order that we

approved previously, correct?

18

MR. WALLACE:

Well, the assets were there only because

19

the president froze them in the first place because of the

international crisis that had arisen.

in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, but there is still

2

active state doctrine defenses, difficulties in collecting

3

judgments, if there are no assets here to attach.

4

There is always a risk that a foreign government will

fall, that our relations with the foreign power will change in

a substantial way that would affect commercial relations and

result in financial disputes.

comparable to the risk undertaken by doing business with a

domestic corporation that may fail, and then instead of being

able to pursue your claim against that corporation in the

ordinary courts, you might find your claim subject to the

6

last five years now has to pay us $100?

7

Can they be retroactive?

I assume they could do that.

MR. WALLACE:

Can the District of

Could they make it

Well, it is common for tax laws to be

8

made retroactive, as this Court has upheld many times, the

9

United States against Darusmont, and others, where there is no

10

specific service that was provided to the taxpayer, but

11

Congress wanted to achieve uniform treatment of the taxpayers

12

under this Court's decisions dealing with the question of

13

retroactivity of legislation regulating economic

14

relationships, the Pension Benefit Guaranty cases, and Usery

15

against Turner Elkhorn.

16

The question is whether there is a rational legislative

17

purpose for the retroactive application itself.

18

there clearly was a rational purpose of treating all claimants

19

who benefitted from the Tribunal and the awards uniformly and

20

having them all share the cost, rather than just having some

21

of the claimants who benefit from these special institutions

22

that we negotiated to protect American claims pay the cost.

23

QUESTION:

And here

So you would say that anyone who uses

24

services of the government is under the contingent liability

25

that they may be charged a retroactive user fee?

years.

assessed the difference between what the filing fee he paid

19

was and $200.

20

They haven't nearly covered expenses.

MR. WALLACE:

So we are going

That would raise problems considerably

21

beyond the problems here since there was already a two percent

22

fee prescribed before Sperry submitted its claim, even though

23

Sperry had a legal argument that that fee would not be valid,

24

Mr. Wallace, is it not true that in this

case Sperry filed its claim before the treasury two percent

regulation was put into effect?

9

MR. WALLACE:

It filed its claim, yes, but submitted

10

the settlement for the entry of the award after it went into

11

effect.

12

QUESTION:

Well, I understand they settled it after it,

13

but when they invoked the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, there

14

was no notice that any claim would be filed, any two percent

15

or one and half percent would be collected.

16

MR. WALLACE:

17

QUESTION:

Not at that time, but --

Under your rationale, would it be

18

permissible for the United States, after the whole claims

20

should pay the expenses, and then assess it at that time,

21

rather than after claims are filed but before judgments or

and then send everybody a bill for their pro rata share.

chose not to do it that way.

without seeking an award from the Tribunal.

These claims

often involved counterclaims and the like.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. SEIVER

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

MR. SEIVER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:

6

In this appeal, the Court is presented with four

7

distinct constitutional challenges to an act of Congress which

attempts to retroactively authorize the imposition of these

deductions from the awards of the Iran claims, Iran-U.S.

10

claims Tribunal.

11

property without just compensation, a denial of equal

12

protection of the laws, a denial of due process, and also run

13

afoul of the origination clause of the Constitution.

14

These deductions work as the taking of

At the time litigants were forced to abandon their

15

district court litigation and pursue their claims against Iran

16

at the Tribunal, there was no legislative authority or policy

17

in existence at the time which would have supported any user

18

fee or any deductions from awards of the claimants at the

19

Tribunal.

20

and forced us to proceed with our claims there, providing it

21

as the only forum for adjudication, expressly provided that

22

the government would bear the costs of operating the Tribunal.

23

There was no discussion of a user fee being charged or any

24

deductions from awards.

The Algiers Accords, which established the Tribunal

procedure.

At the time we filed our claim, UNCITRAL Rule 38

2

was modified to provide that the costs of running the Tribunal

3

would be paid for by the contracting parties, that is the

4

governments, not the arbitrating parties, and such costs could

5

not be an item of an award between the arbitrating parties.

6

Finally, in May of '81, when the Senate had before it

7

authorizations for funding the Tribunal and paying the State

8

Department for paying the expenses of running the Tribunal,

9

the Senate said this Tribunal is very important to U.S.

10

interests.

protect U.S. citizens interests abroad.

13

14

additional personnel;

When the treasury went ahead and assessed its -- and

18

It did so without any prior notice and without any authority.

21

It did allege it had the Independent Offices Appropriations

22

Act when it issued that license for a two percent deduction.

23

But that just didn't apply.

24

We challenged that in the claims court, and then Chief
Judge Alex Kozinski agreed.

Appropriations Act could not be used to justify a user fee.

2

So we have no express authority for charging user fees, we

have no latent, perhaps inherent authority in the government

to charge us a fee for any particular purpose for the use of

anymore.

Wouldn't you agree with that?

MR. SEIVER:

I think not, Your Honor.
You think not.
I think that that, there would be a

4

retroactive problem, but even as to cases that were pending,

costs, has no relationship to the costs that are sought to be

The perfect example of this, I think, was brought

Those that use the services of the Tribunal but don't get

10

an award, or if there was a possibility of getting an award

11

from a separate account, don't pay a single cent for the use

12

of the Tribunal.

13

And that was exemplified by the way the banks handled

their claims.

their claims to the Tribunal, and they have settled their

claims there.

account in England, and no deductions are assessed.

21

to pay, but are not charged anything for their use of the

QUESTION:

4

Excuse me, why is it that the government can

apply a tax retroactively, but not a fee of this sort?
MR. SEIVER:

Well, Justice Scalia, when a tax is

applied retroactively, we look at it basically as it is

7

involuntary.

8

not going to give up to avoid a tax.

to use a government mandated service, generally it is looked

at -- you have to know what you are going to be getting into

at the time you get into it.

the voluntariness aspect is because the government has said

MR. SEIVER:

That is correct.

you have been treated inequitably in the sense that what you

MR. SEIVER:

QUESTION:

9

Yes, it is.
And the other respect is that the losers get

as much benefit as the winners.
MR. SEIVER:

Yes.

There is an additional aspect to it

10

in that the U.S. government is litigating its own claims

11

against Iran, and in the Tribunal, Iran has official claims

12

that it is litigating against our government.

Let's just take one of those, the fact that

the fees are only assessed against the victorious claimants.

You really think that is not an, a rational assessment of who

gets the benefit?

20

MR. SEIVER:

No, it isn't, Your Honor.

That is water over the dam.

think Justice Scalia's question is, these are the costs of

consequences, and dealing with it on that aspect.

3

into the situation here, on the theory that it could have been

4

done in another context, really doesn't justify it.

5

then we have the situation here where it has not been analyzed

6

what the costs are.

7

To bring it

Because

Presumably before Congress would implement a fee such

8

as that, for charging for services of use of the courts, there

9

would be an extensive analysis of the use.

For instance, in

10

an administrative proceeding, the FCC charges a fee for people

11

that go to hearing and for using other services of the

12

commission, and that has been sustained under the IOAA as the

13

government trying to recover the costs of its executive

14

agencies.

15

We don't have a policy like that for the court system.

16

The adjudication of disputes and resolutions has always

17

proceeded in the situation that everybody pays their costs

18

going in, they pay their filing fee, and if the court believes

19

that the winner is entitled to it, they can award the costs.

20

At the Tribunal, we did not have that opportunity.

21

of operating the Tribunal could not be eliminated and be

22

awarded to the winners, as they are in the court systems here.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

3

MR. WALLACE:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

Under this

4

Court's decision in Bradley against Richmond School Board, and

5

related cases going back to the Schooner Peggy, appellate

6

courts ordinarily are to apply intervening changes in the law

7

to pending cases, even though those changes occurred after a

8

final judgment was entered in the trial court, and even though

9

the legislature did not specify whether the intervening change

10
11

in the law would be applied to pending cases.
Now, surely, that is relevant to the question that

12

Justice Stevens posed, for example, about whether Congress

13

could specify that a one and a half percent fee for enforcing

14

judgments should be levied and should apply to pending cases.

15

The bars to retroactive application on intervening changes in

16

the law while pending, to pending cases, are simply not what

17

they have been portrayed to be in this case.

18

legislature has not specified, and under this Court's

19

decisions, when there is a rational basis for the legislature

20

to specify uniform treatment, including retroactive

21

application, so that similarly situated persons will be

22

treated the same, that legislative judgment should be

23

respected by the courts.

payment mechanism should be those that were hit with the fee.

10
11

Why is that?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, that -- there is considerable

12

expense involved in maintaining the security account and the

services supplied by the federal reserve bank.
