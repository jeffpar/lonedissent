ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES T. JONES

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court.
We are here today because the Idaho Supreme

12

Court has misread the requirements of the confrontation

13

clause of the Sixth Amendment.

14

preconditions to the admissibility of hearsay statements

15

of unavailable child witnesses, the court has made it

16

almost impossible to get this kind of evidence into the

17

fact-finding process.

18

By imposing three rigid

In essence, the court has held that the

19

confrontation clause requires the hearsay declarations of

20

child sex abuse witnesses to be videotaped, the product of

21

non-leading, open-ended questions and elicited by an

22

interviewer with no preconception of what the child should

23

be disclosing.

24

The State of Idaho submits that this

25

test cannot be sustained by a reasonable reading of the

confrontation clause, and that it is in fact in conflict

2

with the purpose of the clause to advance the accuracy of

3

the truth determining process in criminal trials.

4

In its effort to protect the confrontation

5

rights of the defendant, the court has made it extremely

6

difficult to get reliable hearsay statements made by child

7

victims and witnesses before the trial courts.

course that is evidence that is critical in many of these

cases.

Now, was there a dismissal on the --

by the local prosecutor after the remand from the Supreme
Court of Idaho, and then that dismissal was vacated?
MR. JONES:

Oh, I see what you're getting at.

12

After -- after the Court granted certiorari, we found out

13

that the prosecutor and the defense counsel had gone into

14

the court and had stipulated for a dismissal in exchange

15

for an agreement that had to do with termination of the

16

parental rights of Mrs. Wright to the two-and-a-half-year

old daughter.

What was the case that was here while

MR. JONES:

We believe that -- that, while there

was still the ability to go into the court to seek

reconsideration of the dismissal order, and while we were

The counsel for the -- for Wright was requested on at

4

least one occasion to file the response.

5

I think it was after the second request for a response

that the case was dismissed.

None was filed.

Was the dismissal with the

case, Mr. Jones?
Thanks, Mr. Chief Justice.

2

MR. JONES:

3

Essentially, we're saying that the Idaho Supreme

4

Court, in looking at the case, had obtained the

5

misimpression that instead of looking at all o f the

6

circumstances to see whether the hearsay statement was

7

admissible, only focused on three circumstances.

8

That is, whether leading questions had been

9

involved, whether there was a videotaping of the interview

10

between the young girl and the pediatrician and whether he

11

had a preconception of what was going to be disclosed.

12
13

I'd like to go into basically the -- the
testimony that's at issue.
QUESTION:

14

(Inaudible) -- as the case comes to

15

us, are we -- must we assume that these witnesses were

16

unavailable?
MR. JONES:

White.
QUESTION:

19
20

Are you going to get to that?

All

right.
MR. JONES:

21
22

I'm going to cover that, Justice

Because -- in fact, I was doing a

little bit of quick research during the previous argument.

A number of witnesses, a couple of police

Her responses were admitted by the trial judge

under Idaho's residual hearsay exception on the court's

finding that they were reliable and that their

5

circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness were

6

equivalent to statements permitted under some of the

7

firmly rooted hearsay exemptions.
QUESTION:

8
9

Why was she -- why was she

unavailable for -- for testifying in trial?
MR. JONES:

10

The trial judge, in the presence of

11

the attorneys and the parties conducted -- but out of the

12

presence of the jury, conducted a voir dire examination

13

and asked the young girl, Kathy, the -- three years old at

14

that time, a number of questions, and at the time of trial

15

he determined that she was not capable of communicating

10

MR. JONES:

11

QUESTION:

That would be correct.
And we take the case on that

12

assumption, that this young child had been determined not

13

to be someone who could be called to testify at trial?

14

MR. JONES:

15

QUESTION:

At that time, that's correct.
But you're making the argument that

16

that same child at an earlier time, outside the courtroom

17

setting, would be competent, in effect, and that her

testimony should come in under some hearsay exception?

2

we call the excited utterance, or res gestae statements?
MR. JONES:

Most of the courts have dealt with

3

those kinds of statements, but there have been two circuit

4

decisions - - Nelson against Farrey and

5

Dorian, Seventh and Eighth Circuit cases, where a child

6

has not come in, been essentially determined incompetent

7

to testify in the courtroom setting, but their hearsay

statements were admitted as being reliable at the time

9

that they were made.

Competence was -- based on -- was it

11

based on the fact that testifying in the presence of the

12

defendant would render -- that she just .would be incapable

13

of doing that in the presence of the defendant?

14

MR. JONES:

The Court didn't specifically say,

15

in the presence of the defendant.

The Court essentially

16

said that in the courtroom setting this particular child,

17

based upon his voir dire at that time, would not be

Do you suppose he would have come out

MR. JONES:

It's a possibility.

There was no

It means that the

It has

not, does it?

11

HR. JONES:

Well, it does to a degree, because

12

here we were looking at a particular statement made by

13

this child in an interview session between the child and a

14

pediatrician, and we were not looking at the total range

15

of everything that the child said.

QUESTION:

No, I'm not talking about at that

stage.

I'm talking about the stage the judgment of

there was no motive for the two-and-half-year-old younger

In our view, the Idaho Supreme Court made a

13

legal error in this case that's best summed up by pointing

14

to three critical factors that the court did not consider

15

or even mention in its opinion:

16

First, the corroboration in this case.

This

17

Court and others have pointed out again and again in the

18

confrontation clause context and others that the degree of

19

corroboration for a particular statement is a very

20

important indicium of reliability of the statement.

21

The second, the spontaneity of the statement.

22

While the Idaho Supreme Court is very critical of the

23

doctor for asking leading questions, the court overlooks

24

the fact that the one -- the one response t:1at the child

25

made which is the critical response in this case, "He does

that it was spontaneous and volunteered.

Third is the fact that this child, the younger

16

child was in the custody of the defendants until just

17

before the physical examination, and so the theory of the

18

case, the theory of defense in this case, which is that

19

the second set of parents must have -- or somebody else

20

must have programmed this child to make these statements,

MR. BRYSON:

I think in Dutton

It didn't prove much, I guess is

10

the point, and I think Justice Blackrnun wrote a separate

11

opinion in that case pointing out and relying on the

12

harmless error factor.

13

It is true that where you have overwhelming

14

evidence, corroborative evidence that supports the

15

reliability of a statement, you may also have something

16

that approaches harmless error.

17

isn't an issue in this case as it comes to this Court.

18

But, nonetheless, I think it's important to focus on each

19

of the various features of corroboration to show how

20

reliable this statement was even though, of course, it

21

wasn't subject to cross-examination .

22

QUESTION:

Of course, harmless error

Your Honor, the way
Is it a firmly rooted exception if

it's in the residual exception category?
MR. BRYSON:

Your Honor, my answer to that

In other words, they require, among

So I think if a court, a Federal court, let's

19

say, applying the Federal residual exceptions correctly,

20

finds that something falls within the residual exception,

21

it would almost necessarily have also made the findings

22

necessary to satisfy the confrontation clause.

23

But now, of course, a state would be free to

24

construe its residual exception more broadly than that,

11

that the witness was incapable of testifying in court.

12

Where the finding is simply that the witness

13

cannot communicate in court and it doesn't suggest what

14

normally we think of by incompetence, which is that the

15

witness is incapable of observing or reporting in any

16

context, then the problem is just one of unavailability .

17

It doesn't -- in other words, the finding of incompetence

Would you be here urging that i f you find all these

outside things, then that testimony ought to come in?

4

MR. BRYSON:

If the -- if the trial court finds

5

that the witness is truly incapable of observing -- let's

6

take it out of the child area and say this is the person

7

of such low mental capacity that the person is -- the

8

trial judge's judgment is that person is incapable of

9

making observations and reporting them to anyone in any

10
11

context.
Then I would think that would be a serious

12

problem for admissibility in that setting because the

13

judge would have found that there is no basis for

14

believing that the statement is reliable because the judge

15

would have found that this can't have happened.

QUESTION:

finding was here?
MR. BRYSON:

Yes.

The judge at joint appendix

communicating with the jury, and that was the whole thrust

of the -- of the colloquy that preceded it, and it was the

The principal claim is the doctor
Doctors do get as much

as they can; and yet, the Idaho Supreme Court seemed to

11

take the view that if this doctor had advance information

impeached, somehow unreliable.

MR. BRYSON:

QUESTION:

Did it say automatically -No.

18

Don't you think it is a proper factor in deciding whether

And I

It may be that we can imagine some way of

conducting criminal trials that will lead to just as

think it's wrong for the state to argue that we can allow
