But I would suggest that what — what the Court

10

should look for is whether or not enough was identified,

11

enough was verified to say this tipster knew this woman and

12

— or this person — and knew enough in this case to say

13

what her itinerary was that afternoon.

14

Now,

the reason for that is — there are many

15

reasons for it, but one is that that — if we had a false

16

tip, that would limit the number of suspects when they go

17

out to investigate who turned a false tip.

18

say that — that if enough details are verified to say this

19

tipster knew this person and knew enough about a situation

20

so that we know, yes, this is the person they're talking

21

about.

QUESTION:

For instance,

How much is

1

required there?

And is more required for a drug stop?

MR. MARSTON:

2

Justice O'Connor, I would suggest,

3

as we have in brief, that basically the requirements should

4

be the same except that in the case of a bomb or something

5

you've got exigency.

6

verification which is, of course, is wide of this case.

7

the point is everyone agrees that if these officers had

8

gotten a bomb tip and said, you know, Vanessa — there's a

9

bomb

in

Vanessa

And that justifies excusing the -- the

and

such

But

—

10

everything else — if they had gone right out there and

11

searched the car, that would have been fine.

12

and it would have been, because the exigency would excuse

13

the verification.

everybody seems to agree on that.
