ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH LESSER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. LESSER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey

12

was created in 1921 by a compact between the states to

13

which Congress consented.

14

And the principal burden of my argument today

15

before the Court is to demonstrate beyond any question

16

whatsoever that the Port Authority is structured,

17

administered and operated as a direct instrumentality of

18

the compacting states, and is politically and legally

19

accountable as such to the governors and legislatures of

20

the compacting states.

21

It should therefore, I submit, be recognized for

22

what it clearly is:

23

machinery of the two states, completely subject to their

24

control and direction.

25

Port Authority should be held, I believe, to share the

an integral part of the governmental

As a direct arm of the states, the

1

states' constitutional protections and immunities,

2

including their Eleventh Amendment immunity.
Such a holding, I shall show, fulfills not only

3
4

the underlying purpose of the Eleventh Amendment's

5

conceded deference to state's sovereignty, but also that

6

of the compact clause, by encouraging the states to solve

7

cooperatively their regional problems, thus enhancing, I

8

submit, the vitality of our Federal system.

9

That the Port Authority is unquestionably a

10

direct arm of the states, fully subject to their control

11

and direction is most easily demonstrated.

12

declares that the commissioners of the Port Authority, 12

13

in all, constitute the Port Authority.

14

The compact

Six of these commissioners are appointed by the

15

governor of each state, with the advice and consent of the

16

respective state senates.

17

to removal after charges upon hearing in New York by the

18

governor of the state, and in New Jersey by the state

19

senate.

The Authority has no autonomous powers of

2

government, like a county or a municipality, which of

3

course, counties and municipalities do not share the

4

states' sovereign immunity from suit.

5

authorized by bi-state legislation.

Authority is duty bound to be obedient to the legislatures

8

and to follow their directions.

9

The Port Authority

Everything the Port Authority does is
And the Port

Because of the Port Authority's closeness,

10

intimate relationship to the compacting states, it is not

11

surprising that before 1950 and '51, when the states

12

waived the Port Authority's sovereign immunity, every

13

court that had occasion.to pass upon this question, the

14

courts of New York, the courts of New Jersey and the lower

15

Federal courts held that the Port Authority shared the

16

sovereign immunity from suit of the compacting states.

17

As a matter of fact —

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Lesser, suppose a municipal

19

corporation had those characteristics.

20

provided that the chief executive officer of a

21

municipality could be impeached by the legislature, and

22

was appointed initially by the — by the governor.

23

that — would that make a — a municipal corporation an

24

arm of the state for Eleventh Amendment purposes?

MR. LESSER:

Not — not at all.

it wants in the abstract.

6

It could only
It can't do what

As a matter of fact, the only time the Port

7

Authority was held to exceed its statutory powers was a

8

case in the early 1950s when the Port Authority thought it

9

had the power to construct a third tube to the Lincoln

TO

Tunnel, relying upon a statutory directive that said that

11

the Lincoln Tunnel shall consist of tubes or tube —• tube

12

or tubes within a narrow geographical compass.

13

And the Port Authority thought that the plural

14

meant two or more.

15

to the contrary.

16

that the Port Authority is bound — duty bound to be

17

obedient to the legislatures.

18

But the New Jersey Supreme Court held
And the New Jersey Supreme Court said

And with that decision of the New Jersey Supreme

19

Court, the Port Authority subsequently got a specific

20

bi-state legislation authorizing the construction of the

21

third tube.

The Port Authority, Justice Scalia, could do

nothing that the legislatures do not authorize.

As a matter of fact, when the states gave the

Port Authority the Holland Tunnel, which was a source of

15

— at least during the 1930s and '40s — of immense

16

revenue to the Port Authority, they controlled the flow of

17

Port Authority funds.

18

Because the last paragraph in the Authority's

19

General Reserve Fund Act, which the legislatures passed in

20

1931, provides any surplus revenues not required for the

21

establishment and maintenance of the aforesaid general

reserve fund shall be used for such purposes as may

Bridge Commission, this Court — this Court assumed that

21

the Commission, which was modeled after the Port Authority

22

— in fact, I was struck when I looked at the legislation

23

authorizing the Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Commission, that

24

legislation was almost copied word from word from the Port

25

Authority's port compact.

1

And the question that this Court had, in Justice

2

Douglas' opinion was, the. question here is whether

3

Tennessee and Missouri have waived their immunity under

4

the facts of this case.

5

difference between the compact authorization of that

6

agency and the Port Authority's was, in that agency there

7

was a sue and be sued clause.

8

9
10

And in that case, the only major

And Justice Douglas' opinion went into detail whether
that sue and be sued clause constituted a waiver of
Eleventh Amendment immunity.
QUESTION:

11

Mr. Lesser, do the directors of the

12

Port Authority have the power to waive immunity in any

13

suit that they choose?

14
15

MR. LESSER:

No, they do not.

The waiver has to

come from the state legislatures.
QUESTION:

16

Well, if that's the case, then it

17

would seem to me that your construction of what you call

18

the venue permission — provision — is unacceptable

19

because then we have to interpret it as a waiver in all

20

cases.

21

MR. LESSER:

22

QUESTION:

No, I think — I think —
If — if — if it's not a venue

23

provision because there's no authority to waive on a

24

suit-by-suit basis, then maybe the best interpretation of

25

that provision is that it is a waiver.

MR. LESSER:

I think not, Justice Kennedy.

Until 1950 and '51, the courts of both states and the
lower Federal courts held that the Port Authority shared
the sovereign immunity from suit of the compacting states.
In fact, one New York court said, it is hard to see
how there could be a clearer instance of an agency sharing
the immunity of its creators.
And a New Jersey court said, since the Authority is
undoubtedly a direct agency of the states, exercising an
essential governmental function and is therefore an alter
ego of the state, it follows that the present action is,
in effect, a suit against the state itself, which will be
clothed with sovereign immunity unless a waiver or consent
can be found.
QUESTION:
MR. LESSER:
QUESTION:

Now, were these —
[Inaudible] —
I'm asking you a question, Mr.

Lesser, if you will just stop for a moment.
MR. LESSER:
QUESTION:

I'm sorry.
Were these cases decided in the

context of the Eleventh Amendment?
MR. LESSER:

No, not directly, no.

They were

decided — I guess what this Court now calls common-law
sovereign immunity from suit.
QUESTION:

MR. LESSER:

No, they were not.

With the decision of these cases in 1950 and '51,
both legislatures adopted the Port Authority suability
legislation.

And in that legislation, section 1 of that

legislation constitutes the waiver.

Section 1 of that

legislation states that the States of New York and New
Jersey consent to suits against the Port Authority.
That's the waiver.

That's the giving of

jurisdiction.
The venue provision to which Justice Kennedy alluded
a moment ago states, the foregoing consent is granted upon
the condition that venue.
So you have to find the waiver of immunity from suit
in section one.
QUESTION;

But it would seem to me that one way

to make your interpretation work is if, on a suit-by-suit
basis, the directors could determine that they will either
waive or not waive.

But if they never have authority to

waive on their own, then it seems to me that the statute
constitutes the waiver.
MR. LESSER:

I think — well, I don't know what

that statutory venue provision means, that reference —
that obscure reference to Federal courts in the venue
provision.

But it certainly doesn't meet the strict and

stringent standard that this Court had said is necessary

3

This Court has said that only where stated by the

4

most express statutory language or by such overwhelming

5

implication from the text, as will leave no room for any

6

other reasonable construction, will it find a waiver.

1

Authority has been a defendant in Federal courts.

2

This was in the era, I think, of Pardon against

3

Alabama Dock Railroad, when this Court stated that when an

4

agency is involved in interstate commerce, and Congress

5

regulates that agency, the states, by engaging in such

6

activity, impliedly waive their Eleventh Amendment

7

immunity.

8

9

But Pardon was expressly overruled by this Court a
few years ago in Welch.

And since the Welch decision, the

10

Port Authority has always maintained that it shares the

11

Eleventh Amendment immunity.

12

The Port Authority was suable in Federal courts,

13

unknowingly, during the era of Pardon.

14

being overruled by Welsh, the Port Authority, I believe,

15

shares the Eleventh Amendment immunity.

16

obscure reference is not the type — to Federal courts —

17

is not the type of knowing waiver that this Court has

18

required.

19

I don't understand it.

But with Pardon's

And I think this

The Second and Third Circuits

20

disagreed as to its meaning.

21

both decisions, the Second and Third Circuits'

disagreement, I don't think either ruling of either

circuit could be considered arbitrary or capricious.

then the question is, where does the presumption lie?

But Justice Frankfurter, in his

MR. LESSER:
QUESTION:
MR. LESSER:

Yes.
The closest case to this —
Well, how about a majority case?
A majority case was the opinion in

the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency case.

In that case,

this Court set forth six factors.
QUESTION:

But that case did not -— that case

ruled against the particular entity in question, didn't
it?
MR. LESSER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And I think wisely so.

Well, so — so the Court — there's

never been a holding of the Court extending Eleventh
Amendment immunity to any body other than the state
itself, or a state official, is that correct?
MR. LESSER:

That's correct.

But the Court has

never had a case where an agency closely — so closely
identified with the states as the Port Authority.
In the Tahoe Regional Planning case, the Ninth
Circuit adopted what this Court has called an absolute
rule that any agency that was so important enough to be
created by acts of two state legislatures, with the
consent of Congress, automatically — this is what the
Ninth Circuit held — automatically possessed the Eleventh
Amendment immunity of the states'.
And I think this Court quite properly rejected

that absolute rule.

This Court set forth six factors in

which it can be determined whether an agency is so closely
allied with the states as to share their

Eleventh

Amendment immunity.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lesser, before you go on to that.

In Petty, what was the sue or be sued clause?
MR. LESSER:

It was contained in the compact

between Missouri and Tennessee.
QUESTION:

And did it say sue or be sued in

Federal court?
MR. LESSER:

It did not.

And the — and the

argument —
QUESTION:

It was — it was a sue or be sued

clause just like yours?
MR. LESSER:

Just like ours.

But it was before

this Court required an absolute waiver of Eleventh
Amendment immunity in Federal court.
QUESTION:

So what you're saying is that even
!

under Frankfurter's view in Petty, the sue or be sued
clause here would have sufficed.
MR. LESSER:

No, not under Frankfurter's view —

not under the view of the three dissenters in Petty.

They

said that this Court should interpret the sue and be sued
clause as the state courts in Tennessee and Missouri
interpreted it.
21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

And they interpreted that clause to mean that
the agency was not liable in tort.

And the majority —

Justice Douglas stated that the sue and be sued clause —
that when Congress adopted or consented to the compact
with the sue and be sued clause, it consented it to the
compact in the light of an earlier decision by this Court
in the late 1930s involving the Reconstruction Finance
Corporation — Keefer against the Reconstruction Finance
Corporation.
And in that case, this Court ruled that a sue
and be sued clause relating to a Federal agency
constitutes a waiver of immunity.
And Justice Douglas said that that decision in
the Keefer case, involving the Reconstruction Finance
Corporation, show that Congress, when it consented to a
sue and be sued clause, consented to a full waiver of
Eleventh Amendment immunity.
But I think, as far as the waiver provision is
concerned, this Court has, in recent years, clearly taken
a much more stringent view, saying that the general sue
and be sued clause does not include a waiver of Eleventh
Amendment immunity unless it's absolutely crystal clear.
But let me just go through — Your Honor, the
factors listed in the Tahoe Regional Planning Association
case.

This Court listed six factors.

And we think the

Port Authority meets all of those six factors to be

2

accorded Eleventh Amendment immunity.
First, this Court said, how were the governing

officials appointed?

governing boards?

Are they appointed by local

In that case, the local -- the majority of the

case.

There was no veto at the state level in that

There is a veto at the state level in this case.
Then this Court said how is the agency

12

13

designated in the enabling state legislation?

14

Port Authority, in the enabling state legislation, is

15

clearly designated as a joint or common agency of the two

16

states.

17

And the

In fact, in the compact to which Congress

18

consented be — there was no sue and be sued clause as I

19

already mentioned — the legislatures, in their preamble,

20

stated that the development of necessary terminal

21

transportation and other facilities of commerce in the

22

region require the cordial cooperation of the states.

23

this can be best accomplished, said the legislatures,

24

through the cooperation of the two states by and through a

25

joint or common agency.

And

That's — and there are many similar
descriptions in the legislation of the Port Authority, as
the common agency of the states.
Then the next factor that this Court set forth
in the Tahoe Regional Planning Association case was how.
was the agency funded.

And as I previously mentioned, the

Port Authority was funded by the state legislatures until
it became self-sufficient.
And in the early days in its history, when —
faced a default on its first bridge bonds.

And the

legislatures were faced with the problem of a default by
an agency like the Port Authority, they turned over to the
Port Authority their Holland Tunnel, which, as I mentioned
before, was constructed by separate state commissions or
state departments, operating cooperatively.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lesser, to what extent might the

general funds of New York or New jersey be held applicable
to the debts of the. Port Authority?
MR. LESSER:

Technically, they're not — a

judgment against the Port Authority is not payable out of
the state treasuries.

But that doesn't mean that the

states are not adversely affected by judgments against the
Port Authority in the same way that they're adversely
affected by judgments against either state.
In fact, the New Jersey Supreme Court recognized
24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

that there can be multiple state treasuries in a case
involving the Port Authority.

In this particular case,

the New Jersey Supreme Court was faced with the problem of
whether the Authority should have the states' rights to
require the uncompensated relocation of private/public
utilities in the streets and the thoroughfares of the
state.
And the New Jersey Supreme Court said that that
state rule was equally applicable to the Port Authority.
The Port Authority cannot be thus divorced from the
citizens and taxpayers it was created to serve.

And the

New Jersey Supreme Court stated that the general state
taxpayer has a tremendous interest in the financial
solvency and the operations of the Port Authority.
I think there can be no doubt, Mr. — this
Court, that the Port Authority is a direct arm an agency
of the states, and it should, therefore, share the states'
sovereign immunity from suit.
Such a holding will, I believe, foster the
principles of Federalism that both the Eleventh Amendment
and the compact clause were designed to serve.
I'll reserve my remaining time for rebuttal.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD W. MILLER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MILLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may

it please the Court.
I'd like to begin, if I may, by responding to a
question that Justice Marshall posed.

In the legislation

governing the World Trade Center, the language is quite
specific that the Port Authority is supreme in its
operation.
All details of the effectuation, including but
not limited to, financing, leasing, rentals, tolls, fares,
shall be within its sole discretion.

And its decision in

connection with all matters, including the Hudson tubes,
shall be controlling and conclusive.
The Port Authority has been described in the
enabling legislation as a body corporate and politic.

It

has been described as a private corporation in the statute
that authorizes suit against the Port Authority.

It says,

as if it were a private corporation.
Now the Port Authority has broad powers, which
it exercises as it sees fit.

It does not go to either

state to get second opinions.

It does not go to either

state to ask their approval for what it wants to do.
It owns real estate in its own name.
It operates real property.

It leases.

It operates marine terminals.

Now, there is specific — there is a specific
section, 7031, which says that all bonds issued by the
Port Authority are deemed to be negotiable instruments.
And they are traded widely in brokerage houses and the
stock exchange.
QUESTION:

Mr. Miller, how is it that some

degree of independence from the state by the — this
agency mean that the entity, the Port Authority, is still
not ultimately controlled by the state, and operate as —
as states '• agency?
I don't see that they're — that the fact that
it has some independence from the states necessarily means
that the Authority is not an agency of the authorizing
states.

Isn't that so?

be to look at the Tahoe case.

In this particular case, there is a specific

statute, involving the Port Authority which obligates the

states only to $100,000 as initial start-up fees and only

for a very narrow category of — of expenses.

In other words, they weren't able to be used as

— as the Port Authority see fit.

The statute said office

expenses, administrative expenses.

It couldn't have been

8

used for a judgment.

9

Other than that particular amount, $100,000 as

initial start-up expenses, there was no exposure at all of

11

the state treasury to any judgment.

And as I read the Tahoe —

That sort of begs the question.

If

the money of the Port Authority is state money, it's kept

in a separate pile, and it's still state money.

But it's not state money.

may be sued.

And that its liability, however, will not

exceed its available funds.

And there's a separate

funding for this agency which it appropriates the funds
every year.
The state treasury is not — not liable beyond
what's in the pot for that agency.

not a state agency, simply because the general treasury is

15

lot closer to answering the question that, yeah, there

16

would no longer be an agency.

17
18

And assuming that they no longer got their
.funding, they no longer got appropriations, they — they

19

had their own board of directors or board of commissioners

20

that met and ran it without answering to Congress or

21

anyone, yeah, I think then, at that point in time, you're

22

moving away from it being an agency.

Which is exactly what I — I — I feel that is
— is the case here with Port Authority.

Port Authority is deemed to be an agency of the state?

We're not getting into that?

QUESTION:
MR. MILLER:
QUESTION:

No.

No.

(Inaudible) — yes.
ICven though -- even though there is

no risk to the state treasury?
MR. MILLER:

Yes.

Now, on the question of waiver, it would appear
that the two sections must be read together.

One section,

7101 that says you can sue us in any court, in any type of
matter, with a few limited exceptions, injunction being
one of them.
The other section says we will condition that
upon the condition that you sue us in the Port Authority
district.

Or otherwise, there is no jurisdiction for such

a suit.
The last part of that section says that is shall
be considered a private corporation for such lawsuits.
QUESTION:

Do you think that the provisions

having to do with suit and the venue section meet the
standards set out in the Atascadero case for a clear,
unmistakable waiver?
MR. MILLER:

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Lesser's explanation of what he thought might have been

intended by that provision.
MR. MILLER:

Well, I thought I heard him say at

10

one point in time that he would agree that it meant the

11

Federal courts.

12
13

QUESTION:

The language meant the Federal

courts, but he offered an explanation for why that
language might have been inserted in there, that was

14

15

something other than an intent to waive sovereign

16

immunity.

17

MR. MILLER:

Well, Your Honor, I can only answer

18

that by saying if — if it's read in conjunction with the

19

prior statute, and they were passed at the same time, 7101

20

and 7106 were passed at the same time, then you would have

21

to conclude, I believe, that when they say you can sue us

22

in any court for any lawsuit, and the only condition we

23

will impose is it must be within a court, be it state or

24

Federal, within the Port Authority district.

determination of — of jurisdiction before you — before

2

you can say that judicial district means Federal courts.

3

I think, in response just to — to— to go into

4

a little background — there was a case called Howell,

5

which is widely cited in — in the petitioner's brief.

6

Howell was a case that came down in the District Court of

7

New Jersey in 1940.

8

The Second Circuit refers to Howell and says

9

that following that decision there was response by the

10

legislatures, and these two sections, among others, were

11

partially in response to the holding in that — in that

12

decision, which found that there was sovereign immunity in

13

the Port Authority.

14

The Second Circuit said, partially in response

15

to Howell, these two sections were enacted.

16

— is fairly clear, I believe, that Port Authority says

17

you can sue us.

18

you do it in the Port Authority district, be it a state

19

court or a Federal court.

The'intent is

We intend for you to sue us as long as

the waiver is that it is simply a — a further condition

QUESTION:

Do you agree with me you've got to

MR. MILLER:

Okay.

I will.

In conclusion, therefore, I would urge the Court

— I think the holding of the Second Circuit is good law.

I think it proposes and found a workable solution to these

types of problems presented in this case.

New York, yes.

QUESTION:

We're talking Second Circuit is

So you say, if it isn't an agency in

New York, it isn't an agency in New Jersey, either?
MR. MILLER: * Well, it's — it's — if it's --

15

it's either an agency or it isn't.

16

then it — it — it — it's not an agency in either state.

If it's not an agency,

Do you mean the two states — the two

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH LESSER

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MR. LESSER:

7

If there's any doubt any — the mind of any

Thank you.

8

Justice of this Court that the Port Authority is a direct

9

arm and agency of the States of New York, I would really

10

request that you look at appendix A to our reply brief.

11

Because that appendix sets forth the 150-odd statutes —

12

separate statutes that the states have passed in reference

13

to the Port Authority from 1921 to the present.

14

Those statutes, dealing with major

15

considerations of state public policy to minor

16

housekeeping chores, in my mind, demonstrates beyond

17

question that the Port Authority is a direct agency and

18

arm of the states that created them.

19

This list of statutes, by subject matter and

20

title, I think leaves no doubt in anybody's mind — should

21

leave no doubt in anybody's mind — of the status of the

22

Port Authority.

It has been — the Port Authority has been

24

questioned as a state agency.

The

1

reason why the Port Authority was created and given those

2

functions was that those problems transcend state boundary

3

lines.
The states try to cooperate in the 1919 compact,

5

to which Congress consented, by setting up independent

commissions that were really departments of state

government to act cooperatively.

mechanism.

9

It wasn't an efficient

I think the compact clause, with the Eleventh

10

Amendment, would fortify Federalism, would fortify the

11

underlying principles of Federalism by giving the states

12

the power to set up an entity like the Port Authority,

13

which is undoubtedly a state agency.

14

QUESTION:

Well, of course, it was called a

15

municipal corporate instrumentality in the compact, wasn't

16

it?

17

MR. LESSER:

That was — yes, it was, in

18

contradiction to a normal municipality.

In the same

19

provision of the compact, it refers to ordinary municipal

20

corporations.

21

at the time what the Port Authority was.

22

advance, I think, in American public law on government

23

that the states could use the compact clause creatively,

24

to create an agency that would represent them in all

25

affairs.

It was something different.

10

I just haven't got the phrase right before

But it distinguishes between ordinary

municipality and municipal corporate instrumentality,

which is the Port Authority.

The Port Authority is assuredly not a

decision in State against Smith.
