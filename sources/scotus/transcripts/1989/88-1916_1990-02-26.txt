ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANNE E. PEEK

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. PEEK:

7
8

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This case presents two critical and recurring

9
10

issues under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S.

11

Constitution.
First, when does an overnight visitor have a

12

13

sufficient expectation of privacy in a house to enable him

14

to challenge his arrest there?

15

merely hiding overnight in a place with permission of the

16

owners is not enough to create a privacy expectation.

17

The state contends that

And secondly, is flight of a dangerous felon

18

believed to be armed an exigent circumstance which

19

justifies a warrantless arrest?

20

it is.

21
22

QUESTION:

The state contends that

Now, what's at issue here is a

statement that was given at the police station?

23

MS. PEEK:

That's correct.

24

QUESTION:

At the time that he was at the police

25

station, was there not probable cause to hold the

prisoner?

2

MS. PEEK:

That's correct, Your Honor.

3

QUESTION:

Well then, how is it that this

4

statement is really related to what occurred in the

5

dwelling in any event?
MS. PEEK:

6

Well, the respondent is claiming that

7

his arrest was illegal under the Fourth Amendment and that

8

his statement was a fruit of the illegal arrest.
QUESTION:

9

Well, there would have been a right,

10

I take it, to let him go for 30 seconds and re-arrest him

11

after he got outside of the dwelling.
MS. PEEK:

12

13

I suppose that's true, Your Honor.

The state, however, has never —

14

QUESTION:

There's no right to be free from

15

custody once they are in the station house just because

16

there has been an unlawful entry in the dwelling, is

17

there?

18

MS. PEEK:

I'm sorry, Your Honor?

19

QUESTION:

There is no right to an immediate

20

release at the station house, a release from custody,

21

merely because there has been an unlawful entry into the

22

dwelling, even assuming the entry to the dwelling was

23

unlawful?

24

MS. PEEK:

I suppose that's true, Your Honor.

25

QUESTION:

Well, then, why is it that we really

have to reach this issue?

2

admissible statement?
MS. PEEK:

3

Why isn't this just an

Well, the state, of course, has

4

always felt that this is an admissible statement because

5

the arrest was legal, and we've never really argued -QUESTION:

6

Yes, but you don't — but you

7

don't -- you don't argue the point that the statement's

8

not tainted in any event.
MS. PEEK:

9

No.

It was never argued below and

10

we've never argued it through the process, Your Honor.

11

It's also the state's position that this Court would not

12

need to reach the exigent circumstances issue if it ruled

13

that the respondent did not have privacy interest in the

14

home, also, and that's been the state's main contention

15

all along.

16

Respondent was a getaway driver involved with

17

his co-defendant in an armed robbery of a gas station and

18

the cold-blooded murder of the gas station attendant.

19

respondent's temporary hideout his home?

20

a person has a constitutionally protected right to privacy

in one's own home.

This

1

Well, doesn't an ordinary house guest

2

have some expectation that he won't be bothered by

3

strangers while within the home?

4

reasonable expectation there, when I'm a guest in someone

else's home?
MS. PEEK:

7

I think there's some expectation,

although whether it's —
QUESTION:

8

9

Isn't there some

And isn't it a reasonable one, one

that society is prepared to accept?
MS. PEEK:

10

Well, I think it depends on all the

11

circumstances of the case.

12

instance a relative, if I stay in my parents' home for a

13

period of time, I would have an expectation of privacy in

14

that home.

15

the home, my expectation of privacy would be much less.

Certainly, if a visitor — for

However, if I were just a casual visitor to

QUESTION:

Well, don't we need some fairly clear

17

rules for the police, things that aren't so fact specific?

18

How's the policeman going to know the length of the visit,

19

or whether a key has been given, or who has given

20

permission?

21

follow fairly simple rules to govern the police action?

22

I mean, why shouldn't we try to craft and

I agree with you that a simple rule

would be nice.

complex.
MS. PEEK:

2

Well, I have two responses to that.

3

One is that I think that we probably don't want the

4

policeman to be making standing decisions, that in fact

5

what we would want in the society is for policemen to be

6

concerned with public safety issues and —
QUESTION:

8

get a warrant?
MS. PEEK:

10

The police in this case didn't get a

warrant because they felt that -QUESTION:

11
12

Why, here, shouldn't the police go

Because it was Sunday.

It was a

"never on Sunday" rule, apparently.
MS. PEEK:

13

I think if this case had occurred on

14

the weekday that they would have done the same thing.

15

They were faced with a murderer, someone who they felt was

16

dangerous, someone who they felt was armed -QUESTION:

17

Well, that's the exigent

18

circumstances.

But just on -- on the right of the police

19

to enter the dwelling, Justice O'Connor indicates that the

rule you argue is fact specific, and I might add it's all

post hoc.

been there, and whether he has the right to exclude guests

23

until after he is arrested and it comes out in

suppression, so it's a very unworkable rule, it seems to

me.

MS. PEEK:

1

Well, presumptively, if the police

2

are entering the home they want them to get a warrant,

3

that's right, but if —

4

QUESTION:

Ms. Peek, your answer is, it doesn't

5

matter, does it?

The police are breaking the law.

The

6

only thing we're arguing about -- there's no doubt that

7

they violated the Constitution.

8

arguing about today is, have they violated your right as

9

well as his right?

The question we are

It's clear that they're violating the

10

right of the person who owns the premises.

The only

11

question is, whether they, in addition, are violating any

12

right of the guest, isn't that right?

13

MS. PEEK:

Well, that's correct.

14

QUESTION:

So predictability has nothing to do

15

with this.

16

the wrong no matter what, isn't that right?

17
18
19

The — the police don't — the police are in

MS. PEEK:

Well, presumptively they should get a

warrant if they're going into a private home.
QUESTION:

Later —

They have clearly violated somebody's

20

constitutional right.

21

is whether they've violated the guests as well as what

22

they clearly have violated — the owners.

23
24
25

MS. PEEK:

The only thing we're arguing about

Well, that is -- that is the crux of

the issue in this case.
QUESTION:

So police predictability is really

out of the case.

2

QUESTION:

Well, except for the fact that they

3

know this man isn't the owner, and they don't care if they

4

violate the owner's constitutional rights because they're

5

not worried about introducing any evidence against him.

6

They don't even care about this — the guy they're looking

7

for.

8

10
11

MS. PEEK:

Well, I don't think they felt that

they were violating anyone's rights because they felt they
had exigent circumstances to make the warrant -QUESTION:

Well, forgetting exigent

12

circumstances for the moment, is it not your position that

13

the police can arrest a person in a dwelling if that

14

person has no reasonable expectation of privacy there?

15

QUESTION:

That's your position, isn't it?

16

MS. PEEK:

No, no.

What we've been saying all

17

along is that -- that we want the policemen to concern

18

themselves not with standing but with probable cause and

19

with exigent circumstances and the other things that they

20

need to decide, and that they should try to proceed

21

legally based on those facts.

Later, a judge can decide whether or not they
were right, and whether or not whose rights were -QUESTION:

1

the arrest, or do you concede that they were violating the

2

rights of the owner of this home?

3

MS. PEEK:

Well, the state has never conceded.

4

It hasn't been an issue, because there's been no evidence

5

against the owners and the owners haven't raised it.

6

issue all along has been the defendant's rights, and so

7

the state has never conceded that the arrest was illegal,

8

but if the arrest was illegal, the issue is, whose rights

9

were violated?

10
11
12

The

I think --

QUESTION:

If there were exigent circumstances,

the arrest was not illegal.
MS. PEEK:

That's correct, Your Honor.

I think

13

our position has been that societal -- the societal --

14

public policy would indicate that we do not want policemen

15

to make arrests based -- to make entries based on whether

16

or not someone has standing.

17

presumptively get a warrant if they need to, and if they

18

don't need to they go in, and later they find out who's in

19

the house and who has interest and later the court can

20

sort out who has standing to object to whatever happens.

21

QUESTION:

We want them to

Quite so, and in -- in a way a vague

22

and unpredictable rule is even better, right, isn't it,

23

because then they can never be sure that even though

24

they're violating the Constitution there will be no

25

harmful consequence following from it?

have a very, very unpredictable rule.

is it's very difficult to -- to formulate a simple rule in

We'll resume the

I would like to, if I could, briefly

summarize why the state should win in both issues.
With respect to the privacy issue, respondent
has the burden of proof to show that he had a legitimate
expectation of privacy in the duplex.
However, he was not the owner, he was not

12

related to the owner, he had no key, he stayed there one

13

night, he had no possessions there other than a few

14

clothes, he had no toothbrush, he'd never slept there

15

before, he was never left alone there, there was no area

16

designated for his exclusive use, and he had no right to

17

exclude others.

18

is that he was --

19

The most that can be said for respondent

QUESTION:

But I thought — I thought the

20

Minnesota Supreme Court concluded that the respondent had

21

the right to exclude others.

22

MS. PEEK:

The Minnesota Supreme Court did not

23

make a finding that he had a right to exclude.

24

merely did was state what it said the record said.

25

However, the record in fact did not say that.

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

determinations of that type by state courts?

11

He may or may not have had the right

12

to exclude in that circumstance, but in this case he was

never left alone so he never had an opportunity to do

that.

who had a key and who was left alone in the duplex, he

therefore could let people in and out.

1

What is your position on whether he

2

could have refused to let somebody in if he'd been there

alone?

Don't you agree he had that authority?

4

MS. PEEK:

I'm sorry?

5

QUESTION:

What is your position with regard to

6

his privacy interest had he been alone?

7

MS. PEEK:

I think if he'd been alone that would

8

have been a factor that would have been in his favor.

I

9

think you have to look at all the rest of the factors to

10

determine whether it's reasonable — a reasonable

11

expectation that he would have the right to exclude.

12

the state's position that the right to exclude is not the

13

only factor that should be looked at.
QUESTION:

14

Well, Ms. Peek, may not the factor

15

that he was never left alone have some bearing on what

16

authority the people who owned the house wanted him to

17

have?

MS. PEEK:

It's

I think that's true, Your Honor.

19

Certainly, when I give a visitor a key, or I say, "Make

20

yourself at home; we're leaving for several hours," that

21

type of thing confers more authority and raises your

22

expectation with respect to your privacy in that home.

With respect to standing, the decision is when

the cops make a mistake as to the rule, if they violate

6

the Fourth Amendment, which we do not concede that they

7

did in this case, the issue then is whose rights were

8

violated?

9

And in this case the state's contending that while

10

the Bergstroms' rights, if that arrest was illegal, may

11

have been violated, the respondent's rights were not,

12

because all he could show was legitimately on the

13

premises, and that this Court has expressly rejected that

14

as a basis for legitimate expectation of privacy in the

15

Rakas case, and I think subsequent cases have reaffirmed

16

that holding.

17

I'd like to just briefly mention the exigent

18

circumstances case.

19

entry was not illegal because respondent was armed -- was

20

dangerous, believed to be armed, and had been in

21

continuous flight since the crime had been committed, and

22

under those circumstances -- the exigent circumstances --

exception to the warrant requirement would apply.

The facts of this case are not unusual.

Under the Minnesota Supreme

To broaden Fourth Amendment protection to

7

persons like respondent who have such a tenuous connection

8

to a place is to severely hamper law enforcement without

9

creating any meaningful privacy protection increase.

10

While felons deserve privacy protection in their homes,

11

they should not be allowed to use the Fourth Amendment as

12

a shield to escape apprehension wherever they flea.

13

QUESTION:

It doesn't hamper law enforcement,

14

because as you've before, the police should not have gone

MS. PEEK:

We do not concede that the police

QUESTION:

No, but on the assumption that there

19

were no exigent circumstances, you concede that the police

20

should not have gone in, if there were no exigent

21

circumstances.

22

MS. PEEK:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

So whatever we say about this rule

about who can assert the right of privacy here, it's not

going to hamper law enforcement.

Clearly, the social cost of the exclusionary rule is such

that we have to balance the law enforcement interest and

the privacy interest.

QUESTION:

What's a cornered -- what's a

cornered felon?
MR. MARZEN:

For purposes of this case we have a

7

very narrow definition, which is one who was actually

8

tipped off, who knew that the police were on to him.

9

could construe it a bit more broadly, as we would, and say

10

that felons who the police can reasonably anticipate will

discover that the police are on to them --

12

QUESTION:

Suppose the police come out with

13

their sirens and their lights blaring, is he then

14

cornered, because the police have let him know that

15

they're there?

16

MR. MARZEN:

The next step in the inquiry, of

17

course, as respondent argues, is that there was in fact no

18

exigency here because it was manufactured by police.

19

There is an insinuation in that that it was

20

improper, what the police did, in telephoning the

21

Bergstroms' residence, in talking to Julie Bergstrom and

22

in having Respondent Olson overhear that conversation.

MR. MARZEN:

Arguably not before the phone call,

so that is why he needed to call up.

In fact, you could

see that without any basis, other than someone saying

that, by the way, in the apartment next door there's a

In that event, you would have -- all the

6

Nor should, I think, the loan homicide detective

7

on duty that Saturday and Sunday be faulted for failing to

8

seek an arrest warrant, because the police did not plan

9

the arrest of Olson at any home.

10

Even if the police thought that Olson would

11

return to the Bergstroms' unit for some reason, an arrest

12

warrant would not have been sufficient to justify the

13

intrusion on the Bergstroms' privacy.

14

15

v. United States.

16

They would have

And again, there would not have been probable

17

cause to obtain that warrant at least until the occupant

of the lower unit had called detective — the homicide

20

time, of course, it was too late to have the couple of

21

hours it would have taken to get a search warrant, enter

22

the Bergstroms' unit, and find Olson in that case.

Therefore, we submit that in this circumstance,

was armed, that he was implicated in a violent crime —

5

frame there would have been time to get a warrant by any

6

means, including by telephone.

7

That

Even if exigent circumstances did not exist in

8

this case, we would submit that the exclusionary rule

9

should not be applied, because Olson, as an overnight

10

guest in the Bergstroms' unit, did not have a legitimate

11

expectation of privacy.

12

The legal standard for defining an expectation

13

of privacy, in our view, should be principally determined

14

by whether the defendant had a right to exclude.

15

Rather than revisit the reasons in our brief why

16

we maintain that that is supported by history in the text

17

of the Fourth Amendment, I would like to address the

18

principal argument by respondent, which is that the right

19

to exclude test is simply inadministerable.

20

In our view of this Court's cases, that would

21

not be the case.

In fact, the Court already applies the

22

right to exclude test, in — at least as we view it, in

23

determining whether parties can consent to a search.

24

Consent, or a right to admit, is really just the corollary

25

or converse of a right to exclude.

Put another way, consenting to a search is just

2

another way of saying that a person has waived his or her

legitimate expectation of privacy.

So that in adopting

circumstances to enter, everyone who could have consented

My answer to the question you gave

my co-counsel is that Olson would not -- if a stranger

8

knocked at the door, Olson would not have had any right to

admit that person and therefore would have had no right to

10

exclude him or her either.

If a door-to-door salesman had

dropped by, or a motor cycle gang, or whomever, he would

12

not have been able to allow them in the house, no more

13

than if you had a baby sitter, or a plumber, or anyone

14

else working on your home, that you have given them some

part of your right to admit and exclude people so that

16

they can have other parties on the premises.

17

This is not to say that you may not have — as

18

your agent you may have told your baby sitter or someone

19

that you would expect the plumber to come by and, you

20

know, they would be able to admit the person to that

extent, but they do not have any of your rights that they

are exercising.

If the Bergstroms had left Olson at their house

while they went to church on Sunday morning, Olson would

not have been allowed to let people in.

respond briefly to a question that was raised by Justice

MR. BRUDER:

I believe the living room was a

he and another house guest had stayed in the living room

forth, and you're given at least a room over which you

have some dominion?

17

MR. BRUDER:

Well, in some ways, Your Honor, I

18

think it's exactly like that.

It depends on the size of

19

the house, and I don't think that we can qualify

20

somebody's right to invoke the Fourth Amendment based on

21

the size of the dwelling that he resides in.

22

From personal experience, I can tell you that

23

the last time I had an overnight house guest, it was my

24

former roommate from California and he slept in the living

25

room because we don't have a spare room for him.

would suggest that the mere fact that he doesn't have a

I think that that would obviously

be a very fact-specific circumstance, and I don't know if

this Court, in laying down broader holdings, can

necessarily articulate that in any sort of a general

standard, but I certainly think that that would be, you

However, obviously we have to be concerned about

Contrary to the claims advanced by petitioner,

believe has never been regarded as a prerequisite for the

4

assertion of Fourth Amendment rights.

5

In particular, in Jones v. United States, this

6

Court recognized that Jones had standing to contest the

7

search even though his interest in the property was

8

subordinate to that of his friend Evans, and although the

9

petitioner argues mightily to the contrary, I believe this

10

case amounts -- by the prosecution amounts to a direct

11

attack on the factual holding of Jones v. United States,

12

as subsequently limited by Rakas, and only by expressly

13

overturning Jones can this Court overrule the Minnesota

14

Supreme Court.

15

The Minnesota Supreme Court at great length

16

expressly relied on Jones v. United States in making its

17

determination.

18

that Jones, on the day of the incident in question,

19

admitted himself with a key, had a suit and a shirt at the

20

apartment, that his home was elsewhere, that he paid

21

nothing for the use of the apartment, and that he'd slept

22

there for but a single night.

would suggest.

determinative, it could lead to bizarre and absurd

results.

8

and since she's there during work hours, she has exclusive

dominion and control over the premises, and under the

model constructed by the Solicitor General and by the

11

petitioner, my cleaning woman would presumably have a

12

greater privacy expectation than would Mr. Olson at the

home of his friends.

I think that consequently -Suppose we changed it and just added

you were permitted to use generally and not for the one

MR. BRUDER:

Your Honor, I think there are

several problems with that.

on the remaining validity of Jones v. United States.

there were exigent circumstances.

8

MR. BRUDER:

Did you intend to

I will do so right now, Justice

O'Connor.
Assuming that the Court affirms the respondent's

9
10

right to challenge his warrantless arrest, that seizure

11

under Payton and under Welsh is presumptively unlawful

12

unless accompanied by exigent circumstances.

13

the type of urgent need that constitutes exigent

14

circumstances is some sort of demonstrable danger to the

15

public or the police which will be minimized by a

16

warrantless arrest, and it's the state's burden to come

17

forward with proof that there was an exigent circumstance

18

here.

19

Generally,

At the outset, let me point out that I'm not

20

certain that this is a very good case for this Court to

21

decide whether or not exigent circumstances existed,

22

because the Solicitor General and the petitioner both

23

agree that one of the prerequisites for the determination

24

of an exigency is that there be probable cause at the time

25

of the respondent's arrest.

In its decision, the Minnesota Supreme Court

expressly decide -- determined that they would not decide

the probable cause issue but simply assume that probable

cause existed for the purpose of answering his

constitutional challenges and ultimately reversed his

conviction.

Accordingly, if this Court wishes to look at

exigent circumstances, I think that the appropriate

resolution here would be to remand it -- remand this

I'm a little troubled by the

question, because from the construct that I began this

had no other place to reside, so that an arrest warrant

16

would probably be the appropriate one, because this is as

17

close as he had to a dwelling.

18

upon reading the Solicitor General's brief, and upon

procure.

QUESTION:

7

That is -- that is correct.
So why wouldn't you — all you'd need

is an arrest warrant, insofar as your client is concerned?
MR. BRUDER:

I don't have any problem with the

8

finding that all that would be needed in this case is an

9

arrest warrant.

10
11

I began the defense with the assumption

that all that was necessary was an arrest warrant.
However, even if a search warrant was necessary,

12

that doesn't very well -- that doesn't very much help the

13

state's claims as far as exigent circumstances, because

14

their entire position in this proceeding is that an arrest

15

warrant is very difficult to get it and a search warrant

16

is very easy to get.

get one to arrest my client.

period of time.

21

So if all that was necessary was a

Certainly on the day before

As far as the state's argument is concerned that

22

an arrest warrant was more difficult to obtain, they're

23

very hard-pressed to come forward with any proof of that,

24

Your Honor, because they made no effort to obtain one.

25

Indeed, the investigating detective testified that in his

1

20 years as a police officer, he'd never before tried to

2

obtain an arrest warrant on a weekend.
So there is nothing before this Court that

3
4

suggests that respondent's arrest would have been delayed,

5

if the police would have simply taken the step of

6

approaching a neutral and detached magistrate and

7

requesting some type of warrant be issued.

8

that, I would suggest that it's basically conjectural to

9

believe that the respondent was armed at — when the

More than

police made the decision to arrest him.
Certainly the crime involved was a grave one.

11
12

I'm not about to deny that.

the police, the respondent was observed to be unarmed, and

14

even the police anonymous tipster made no allegation that

the respondent was armed.

But at the time he fled from

In essence, what we have here is a situation

17

whereas the prosecution and the Solicitor General hope to

18

define exigent circumstances, it will in effect strike

19

away at the heart of Payton v. New York.
The Solicitor General comes in here and says

20
21

that whenever a dangerous felon is known to be -- knows

22

that he's cornered by the police, the police have a right

23

to go in and arrest him without making the presumption —

24

without going before a judge and attempting to obtain a

25

warrant.

But consider the implications of that.

1

In this

2

case, the police called up the respondent and said, come

3

out and surrender yourself to us, and when he refused to

4

do that, they used that as an exigency to suggest, having

5

done that, now that he knows we're here, we can come in

6

and arrest him, rather than simply trying to go before a

7

judge at the outset and obtaining a warrant to authorize

8

to authorize the respondent's arrest.
If exigency is defined as the Solicitor General

9
10

hopes to define it, there will be no situation --

11

absolutely no situation -- where an arrest warrant will be

12

required for a felon, because in every instance, the

13

prosecution will be able to establish an exigency simply

14

based on a phone call demanding that the suspect surrender

15

himself voluntarily.

16

there's an exigency and they can go in and make an arrest.

17

That will in essence sweep away most of the protection

18

offered by the Fourth Amendment, at least in an arrest

19

context.
