ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. RESNICK:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In this appeal, Petitioner contends that the

12

decision of the miss — the Mississippi Supreme Court's

13

decision to save Petitioner's sentence of - death from

14

constitutional error violates his Fourteenth Amendment

15

right to have a jury weigh and balance permissible

16

aggravating circumstances against the mitigating

17

circumstances, as required by state" law, and violates his

18

Eighth Amendment right to have the lawful sentencing

19

authority consider and give effect to his evidence in

20

mitigation.

21

Mr. Clemons was convicted of capital murder for his

22

involvement with two others in a felony murder in

23

Mississippi.

24

sentencing hearing, and at this hearing Mr. Clemons

25

offered substantial evidence in mitigation that was

Following the conviction, the court held a

sufficient to support findings of a number of statutory

2

and non-statutory mitigating circumstances under

3

Mississippi law.

4

These mitigating circumstances included the youth

5

of the defendant — Mr. Clemons had just turned 18 at the

6

time of the offense; his expression of remorse at trial;

7

his substance abuse, both chronic and at the time of the

8

crime; organic brain damage sufficient to impair his

9

judgment; his chances of benefitting from a rehabilitation

10

program while incarcerated, and his lack of any prior

11

criminal history.

12

The prosecution did not offer any additional

13

evidence at the sentencing hearing, choosing instead to

14

argue the evidence that was presented at the guilt trial

15

in support of the two aggravating circumstances that were

_16

submitted to the jury by the court.

Those two aggravating

17

circumstances were the robbery and the especially heinous,

18

atrocious or cruel aggravating circumstance.

19

The trial court did not provide the jury, in giving

20

the instructions, any limiting construction of the

21

especially heinous aggravating circumstance.

22

definition whatsoever of those terms were given to the

23

jury as they considered the capital sentencing

24

determination in this case.

Clemons contemplated lethal force.

18

While Mr. Clemons' appeal was appending to

In light of this development, the

The bottom line of the Mississippi Supreme Court's

19

opinion in this case is that the invalidity of an

20

aggravating circumstance will not suffice to overturn a

21

sentence of death, as long as a single valid aggravating

22

circumstance remains.

23

Mississippi Supreme Court"could employ two methods, two

24

alternative methods, to reach this result.

First, the

Court may independently reweigh the aggravating

circumstances against the mitigating circumstances in an

3

effort to cure the constitutional error in this case.

4

Second, the state has also contended that the

analysis to the facts of this case to show that the jury's

consideration of the especially heinous aggravating

circumstance was harmless.

alternative is constitutionally sufficient to save the

penalty of death in this case.

MR. RESNICK:

As a matter of fact, in the text of the opinion,

the court specifically stated, when reviewing the

sufficiency of the jury's finding in aggravation and the

balance that was struck, that they are bound by the jury's

bound by the factual findings of the jury, suggesting that

That appears in the opinion.

They are

10

The Florida courts have a different procedure.

11

Under those procedure — under Florida procedure, the

12

trial court, the sentencing authority, makes findings of

13

fact, both in aggravation and in mitigation, and justifies

14

those findings of fact by their review of the record.

15

then the case goes up on appeal.

Would the case be different here,

constitutionally, in your view, if the supreme court of

Mississippi had said in its opinion we have the authority

that the result is justified?

QUESTION:

So the — no matter, even if they had

said what I just said in this opinion, you would say,

citing the earlier opinions in which they have said we

mistaken as to their authority under state law in this

case?
MR. RESNICK:

10

I don't believe, Your Honor, that

11

they were mistaken as to their authority under state law

12

in connection with their ability to look at the balance

13

struck in this case and compare it as part of a

14

proportionality review with other cases.

Yes.

11

Well, the Fifth Circuit seems to agree

case, it seems to say so.

15

MR. RESNICK:

that the Mississippi Supreme Court has from time to time,

they had always found that the specially heinous

3

where one aggravating circumstance, or more aggravating

circumstances, is invalid, either under state law or under

the federal constitution, a remaining valid aggravating

penalties.
QUESTION:

Well, it said that Mississippi —

Mississippi law is clear, that one invalid aggravating

circumstance will not suffice to a return.

the Fifth Circuit said.

QUESTION:

There was a Mississippi judge on the

panel.
MR. RESNICK:

It's Petitioner's contention that

18

when the Mississippi Supreme Court has applied this rule,

19

in other words, where one aggravating circumstance does

20

not outweigh —or, excuse me, where one aggravating

21

circumstance, or insufficient or invalid aggravating

22

circumstance, will not outweigh — I am sorry, will not

23

invalidate the death sentence, it's Petitioner's

24

contention that this is being applied in a mechanical

25

fashion.

It is an automatic rule of affirmance.

The problem in this case is that the Mississippi —

The

Well, why — why is that

unconstitutional?
MR. RESNICK:

The problem is — is that -- the

13

constitutional problem here is that, in this case, and

14

under the Mississippi statutory scheme, aggravating

15

circumstances play a very important role in guiding the

16

discretion of the jury.

17

was before this Court in Zant, the aggravating

18

circumstances, in this case the jury was instructed to

19

consider two, the label of aggravating circumstance sticks

20

with the jury throughout their consideration.

21

Unlike the Georgia scheme, which

circumstance in Oklahoma, that this Court has already

25

which the jury could predicate a death sentence, has been

1

declared unconstitutional, because it goes to the heart of

2

arbitrariness under the Eighth Amendment.

3

In this case there is every reason to believe that

4

the jury relied upon this aggravating circumstance in

5

coming to its conclusion that death is the punishment that

6

should be imposed in this case.

7

thought that this was its strong point.

8

especially heinous aggravating circumstance virtually to

9

the exclusion of the robbery circumstance, in urging the

10

The prosecution obviously
It argued the

jury to come to a death sentence.

11

Moreover, in arguing the especially heinous

12

aggravating circumstance, the prosecution used the broad,

13

and exploited the broad nature of the especially heinous

14

aggravating circumstance as a vehicle to put before the

15

jury evidence of personal sympathetic characteristics of

16

the victim.

17

the death penalty under the especially heinous rubric, the

18

fact that the victim was an honest person, that he was law

19

abiding, he was a good person, worked hard, educated.

20

Indeed, the prosecution stated that this victim would have

21

done more, and would have accomplished a lot more in life,

22

if it were not for the senseless, heinous, atrocious and

23

cruel murder.

QUESTION:

Mr. Resnick, did the court employ also a

MR. RESNICK:

QUESTION:

The federal harmless error analysis?

That met the Chapman standard.

I assume

6

it was a state standard, but one meeting perhaps the

7

Chapman standard.

8

MR. RESNICK:

The court did state in its opinion

9

that it found that the same result would occur had the

10

jury not considered the especially heinous aggravating

11

circumstance, and they found that beyond reasonable doubt.

12

So the answer to the question is yes.

13

are asking this Court to do, since this is a federal

14

question with constitutional error here, is to reexamine

15

that conclusion.

presented in this case and compares them to those in

Chapman, in Satterwhite, and the factors that this Court

QUESTION:

Well, you don't take the position that

the Mississippi Supreme Court could not apply a harmless

error standard to a sentencing error, do you?

MR. RESNICK:

That's correct, as long as that

MR. RESNICK:

Your Honor, the problem with

reweighing, the constitutional problem with reweighing, is

3

that the Mississippi Supreme Court has already professed

the fact that it is practically incapable of finding fact.

And — let me — let me start over by saying what

is involved in the decision to impose death in

decision must be made by the sentencing authority as to

the relative weights for both the aggravating and the

14

must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt and

Under the federal constitution.

MR. RESNICK:

QUESTION:

6

MR. RESNICK:

Correct.

And why, again, is that?
For a number of reasons.

First, Mr.

7

Clemons is asserting before this Court a Fourteenth

8

Amendment right to have the jury make the particular

9

findings that death is the appropriate punishment in this

10
11

case.

It —
QUESTION:

Well, but we have certainly held in

12

other cases, in Spaziano, that the jury is not a necessary

13

part of the sentencing phase of a death case.

14

MR. RESNICK:

In — that's correct.

In Spaziano

15

this Court did hold there is no constitutional right to

16

have a jury just make that question.

17

suggesting is that it must be somebody at the trial level.

18

Spaziano does not say that an appellate court may make the

19

particular findings that death is an appropriate —

QUESTION:

What we are

Well, in Cabana we said an appellate

court could make findings in connection with sentencing.
MR. RESNICK:

In connection with proportionality

analysis of the Edmund findings, that that is the type of

24

appellate fact finding that would be permissible.

permissible and the other not, under the federal

2

constitution?
MR. RESNICK:

3

Because in this case what we are

4

asking the sentencing authority to do is to make a moral

5

judgment and factual finding with respect to multiple

6

issues, with respect to multiple issues in aggravation.

7

The — excuse me, in mitigation.
QUESTION:

8

9

Well, any court that reweighs, like the

Florida court, is going to make some sort of a moral

10

judgment.

11

So long as you allow reweighing on appeal, the appellate

12

court is going to make some sort of a moral judgment, is

13

it not?

14

That is made by the supreme court of Florida.

MR. RESNICK:

That's correct, as long as it is a

15

well-informed judgment.

16

Florida may reweigh because they have findings in

17

mitigation and aggravation, and the trial court's

18

justification for making those factual findings.

19

the Court expressed in its per curiam opinion in Goode,

20

and in the (inaudible) opinion in Barclay, there was

21

nothing wrong with the Florida Supreme Court reweighing

the findings the aggravation and the findings in

mitigation.

MR. WHITE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Of course, the issue is very clear here, whether

11

the Mississippi Supreme Court can interpret its own laws,

12

as I think that this Court has said many times that it

13

can, to allow it to affirm a death case or sentence where

14

there is the presence of one aggravating circumstance that

15

is invalid.

16

QUESTION:

Does it have just a flat, automatic

17

rule, so long as one aggravating circumstance remains, it

18

will affirm a death penalty?

MR. WHITE:

pointed out in the remand in Johnson v. Mississippi.

Is it plausible to read this opinion as

MR. WHITE:

I think that, with the expression on

beyond a reasonable doubt, you may come to that
conclusion.

I think that is what we have to rely on that

they did so.
QUESTION:

But in your view it is plausible to read

MR. WHITE:

not a great deal of difference between harmless error and
reweighing*;

This Court has approached that —

All right, then it is all the more

plausible to read the opinion that way, correct?

Well, you just conceded that a plausible

way to read the opinion is to say there is no reweighing,
that it is just harmless error.

have no idea what mitigating circumstances the jury found.

MR. WHITE:

Well, I — the first respect of that, I

4

would dispute the fact that the Mississippi Supreme Court

5

has ever said that it cannot.

6

difficult task, but it has never said that it cannot find

7

facts, because it does find facts and substitutes its own

8

factual finding sometimes for lower court factual

9

findings, occasionally.

10

It says that it is a

Here, I think they look at the record.

They take

11

the totality of it, and I think they say, as a given, say

12

that they found all of these mitigating factors, and they

13

look at it again and consider the situation, and then do a

14

— their analysis that way.

15

QUESTION:

If they reweigh, isn't that the function

16

you perform when you are doing the sentencing?

17

think you say in your own brief, they could not impose a

sentence themselves.

MR. WHITE:

And I

No, they could not have imposed a

sentence themselves.
QUESTION:

And isn't the reweighing necessarily a

part of the process of sentencing?
MR. WHITE:

I think it is, but that's — the

24

sentence has already imposed.

25

any errors in that sentence at that point, if that's —

QUESTION:

I can understand your saying that it is

harmless error, after they study it all the way through,

3

but I really am a little, little uncertain -- I am not

4

sure I exactly capture your position on what the

5

reweighing process is.

6

there was no error, because they only do it after they

7

decide there was some error.

MR. WHITE:

QUESTION:

It isn't a way of finding that

Yes.
And it isn't a sentencing itself,

12

what it is.

13

MR. WHITE:

And it isn't a

So I am really not quite sure

Maybe it is a combination of all of it.

14

I think they look at it as a reweighing and a harmless

15

error situation there, both, if they are at all separate

16

in the long run there.

17

But, as long as the information that goes to the

18

jury, in the concurrence in Barclay, as long as the

19

federal Constitution does not bar introduction of the

20

evidence underlying those aggravating factors, it does not

21

require the death penalty be set aside.

22

existence or non-existence of mitigating factors is one of

23

those things that the court considered in affirming in

24

Barclay, and the balance struck — I mean, can the court

25

look at that and balance those issues again.

There — the

court, I think, clearly said that in — in Barclay and

Goode both, that they could do that, that the state courts

3

could do that.
QUESTION:

4

Is it clear that the rebalancing that

5

the Mississippi court made here was a rebalancing without

6

taking into account the heinous and aggravating

7

circumstances factor?
MR. WHITE:

8

9

I don't know that it is absolutely

clear that they did that, since they did say that, as an

10

alternative ground, that they were applying it, their own

11

limiting construction in finding this -- the -- that this

12

was a properly submitted thing also -QUESTION:

13

That is what I find confusing.

If they

14

had just said, you know, their thing reads Mississippi —

15

considering that Mississippi law holds one invalid

16

aggravating circumstance will not suffice to overturn a

17

death penalty, and that doesn't trouble me, because it

18

won't suffice; it is not sufficient where one or more

19

remains.

20

this, that this — what was the other aggravating

21

circumstance, that this was — killing occurred in the

22

commission of a robbery and was committed for pecuniary

23

gain —

Had it then gone on to say and considering that

torturous facts surrounding the murder of Arthur Shorter.

4

That sounds as though they are doing the balancing still

5

taking into account the heinous factor.

6

trouble you?

7

But that is not what they

They go on to say and considering the brutal and

MR. WHITE:

Doesn't that

Well, I think — I think that those

8

are, maybe a separate analysis.

Because that is — that

is clearly properly before the jury.

That was admitted

10

during the brutal facts of the crime, or admitted during

11

the guilt phase of the trial.

QUESTION:

No.

I agree.

21

additional ground in both Zant and Barclay that the court

has relied on, not just the fact that the issue, or the

evidence that went to the jury was not inadmissible.

by the states, and I think that's — for the wantonness

QUESTION:

One thing puzzles me, you say that the

13

Mississippi court can't review facts, but on page 50 of

14

the joint appendix, the Mississippi Supreme Court, in

15

every capital case, I gather, complies with the provision

16

of the Mississippi code that requires, it to make an

17

independent finding that the punishment of death is not

18

too great when aggravating and mitigating circumstances

19

are weighed against each other, and the death penalty will

me.

This language, in the further review opinion,

2

predates the 1977 statute in Mississippi.

3

there was a — and let me back track.

4

there was a statute in Mississippi that required a

5

mandatory death sentence.

Mississippi Supreme Court construed their state -- their

7

statute so as to make it constitutional.

this Court's opinion in Gregg and in Proffitt, the

12

14

Since 1977, when the — when the Mississippi

15

legislature and the people of Mississippi committed the

16

death sentence determination to the jury, this language

17

has appeared almost as if in boilerplate in the

18

Mississippi Supreme Court's opinions from time to time.

19

But the history of it dates back to a time when the

20

Mississippi Supreme Court did not have, there was no

21

statutory prohibition against it, undertaking some sort of

22

proportionality reweighing to compare the balance in this

23

case against the other cases that come before it.

24

But that doesn't — that does not cure the

constitutional error.

2

mitigating circumstances in the plural, that if indeed

3

there was a reweighing here, what the court did was

4

include the very unconstitutional factor that it was

5

trying to cure.

That's no cure at all.

In Barclay v. Florida, one of the principles that

6

7

this Court relied upon in affirming the death sentence,

8

was that the Florida Supreme Court does not apply its

9

harmless error analysis in an automatic or mechanical

10

fashion, but rather upholds death sentences on the basis

11

of this analysis only when it actually finds that the

12

error is harmless.

That-was crucial to this Court's

I would urge the Court to take a look at the case

15

decided at footnote 6 in the state's opinion, page 31.

16

reading of that — those opinions will show that what the

17

Mississippi Supreme Court has done, although, as the state

18

agrees, that is all dicta in the sense that it wasn't

19

necessary to the opinion because they affirmed the

20

especially heinous aggravating circumstance in any event,

21

what they have done is automatically affirm, that one -

22

remaining aggravating circumstance is sufficient,

notwithstanding the fact that, for example in this case,

it undercuts half of the state's case at the death penalty
