ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN I. VLADECK
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. VLADECK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
At the heart of these complicated

13

cases is the simple and well-settled

14

distinction between federal officers who are

15

appointed to a second office and those who have

16

been assigned to exercise additional duties

17

germane to their original appointment who hold

18

one office, not two.

19

The dual office-holding ban

20

incorporates this distinction, prohibiting

21

active-duty military officers from holding a

22

second office that requires nomination by the

23

President and confirmation by the Senate absent

24

express congressional authorization, while

25

generally allowing military officers to be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
5
1

assigned to exercise the duties of such

2

positions.

3

That's why when the four judges at

4

issue here began to serve as appointed judges

5

on the CMCR, the Court of Military Commission

6

Review, it violated the dual office-holding ban

7

and disqualified them from hearing the

8

Petitioners' appeals.

9

Congress created the Court of Military

10

Commission Review in 2006 as part of the

11

Military Commissions Act, and the initial plan

12

for the CMCR was modeled very much on the

13

then-existing courts of criminal appeals in the

14

court-martial system, right down to how the

15

judges were to be selected.

16

original language of the 2006 Act, judges could

17

be assigned by the Secretary of Defense to the

18

CMCR, and those judges could either be

19

civilians or military officers.

20

So, in the

In 2009, when Congress turned around

21

the CMCR, when Congress decided to make it more

22

independent of the executive branch, one of the

23

measures it pursued was to bifurcate that

24

provision and to break out the assignment of

25

military officers and the appointment of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
6
1

"additional judges" by the President with the

2

advice and consent of the Senate.

3

And it's our submission that when

4

Congress did so, it created a civil office and

5

it did not expressly authorize military

6

officers to hold that civil office.

7

when the D.C. Circuit suggested in the Nashiri

8

case that there is a constitutional problem

9

with the assignment of military officers to the

That's why

10

CMCR and the President responded by appointing

11

five of those officers, four of whom are

12

relevant here, to that court, it triggered the

13

dual office-holding ban and, in our view,

14

disqualified those officers from continuing to

15

serve -­

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

MR. VLADECK:

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So are you -­

-- on the CCA.
-- saying it was

19

the suggestion of the D.C. Circuit that the

20

constitutional problem would be cured by

21

appointing these judges to the CMCR, that gave

22

you the basis for your lawsuit?

23

words, when Congress said it authorized CCA

24

judges to serve on the CMCR and said the

25

Secretary of Defense may assign persons who

In other

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

hold military positions, you had no case,

2

right?

3

MR. VLADECK:

We certainly would have

4

no case under the dual office-holding ban,

5

Justice Ginsburg, for the simple reason that

6

when military officers are assigned, whether to

7

the CCAs or to the CMCR, they don't hold a

8

second office in the first place.

9

There, of course, was the Appointments

10

Clause challenge to those assignments, but,

11

yes, there would be no problem under this

12

statute in that circumstance.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And you say the

14

consequence now, because they are appointed

15

rather than assigned, is that they not only can

16

no longer serve on the CMCR, but they're out of

17

the service entirely.

18

to these people who were just doing what they

19

were assigned to do and now told:

20

you're out of the military, although you spent

21

19 years here.

22

That's rather draconian

Sorry,

Too -- too bad.

MR. VLADECK:

So just to clarify, they

23

can still serve on the CMCR, right, that we are

24

not challenging the appointments to the CMCR.

25

Our argument is simply that that converted

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
8
1

these officers into civilians.

2

But to Justice -­

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And -- but you are

4

saying that how -- you -- they would have to be

5

civilians on the CMCR.

6

MR. VLADECK:

That's correct.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Because you say

8

they -- they lose their military -- and to be

9

civilians, they'd have to be reappointed.

10

MR. VLADECK:

So we don't -- we don't

11

dispute that it is a severe consequence,

12

Justice Ginsburg, but we would just suggest

13

that it was the consequence Congress wrote into

14

the statute in 1870.

15

dispute that before 1983, at least, there would

16

have been no question that that was the

17

appropriate consequence in this case.

18
19
20

The government does not

And it also reflects the common law
incompatibility rule.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the -­

21

the idea of fair notice to people who have

22

devoted their lives to military service and

23

then are told you're out?

24
25

MR. VLADECK:

There's no question, of

course, that Congress could make these officers

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
9
1

whole if there is any regard in which this

2

action led to the deprivation of benefits.

3

But, of course, this has happened

4

before.

This Court and the Court of Appeals

5

for the Armed Forces has ruled at various

6

points in the past that you had military

7

officers who were wrongfully appointed, that

8

you had military officers who were acting ultra

9

vires.

We don't dispute that it's an

10

unfortunate consequence for these four

11

officers.

12

common law and the statute demands in these

13

cases.

14

We just think it is the one that the

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what do you -­

15

what do you make -- what do you do about the

16

fact that in 1983 Congress eliminated the part

17

of 973 that said that an officer is

18

automatically terminated if the officer accepts

19

a covered civil office?

20

savings clause, which says that nothing in

21

Section 973(b) shall be construed to invalidate

22

any action undertaken by an officer in

23

furtherance of assigned official duties?

24
25

MR. VLADECK:

And what about the

So I think the -- the

answer to both questions, Justice Alito,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

depends upon placing the 1983 amendments in

2

context.

3

I'll try to do so.

4

And if you'll indulge me, I'll -­

The purpose of the 1983 amendments, we

5

and the government agree, was in direct

6

response to the OLC opinion, which had called

7

into question the widespread practice of JAG

8

lawyers, military officers, serving as special

9

assistant U.S. attorneys and prosecuting

10

ordinary civilian offenses on military

11

installations.

12

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

We can accept that

13

that might have been the purpose of the

14

statute, but what do we do with the text, I

15

think is what Justice Alito is getting at.

16

MR. VLADECK:

I totally -- and -- and

17

if you'll bear with me, I'm -- I'm hoping to

18

get there, Justice Gorsuch.

19

So the -- the point of the statute was

20

to basically say these assignments are not, in

21

fact, a problem under the dual office-holding

22

ban because they're not reflecting a military

23

officer holding two offices; that, in fact, the

24

pre-1983 statute had been construed by the

25

Justice Department perhaps over-broadly.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official
11
1

so both the savings clause and the elimination

2

of the automatic termination language were with

3

an eye toward this purpose, to narrow the scope

4

of the dual office-holding ban.

5

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Got it.

6

waiting for the text argument.

7

MR. VLADECK:

Still

So there's no text, of

8

course, on termination.

Now, the text of the

9

savings clause refers to actions in furtherance

10

of assigned official duties.

11

at page 10A of the blue brief.

12

the question is, what does "assigned" mean in

13

that provision?

14

You'll find this
And, of course,

Our argument is that "assigned" there

15

is in contrast to appointed or elected, that

16

because the 1983 amendments were about

17

reasserting the distinction between holding two

18

offices and simply exercising additional duties

19

as part of your original military office, it

20

makes sense, it's appropriate, it's consistent

21

with the text to read assigned in that context

22

to mean exactly what the JAG officers had been

23

doing that triggered the statute in the first

24

place.

25

of a civil office as part of their assigned

They had been exercising the functions

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12

official duties.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what do we make

3

of the words "except as otherwise authorized by

4

law"?

5

purpose of the automatic termination were

6

people who were running for public office

7

without authority by law.

8

there was no federal law saying they could do

9

this.

It seemed to me that what was the

10
11

They were -- meaning

So what do you do with this -- with
that "except"?

12

MR. VLADECK:

So I think -- I mean, a

13

good example, there are, of course, examples

14

where Congress has expressly authorized

15

military officers to hold a second, even civil

16

office.

17

familiar example is the CIA director.

18

And perhaps the most common and

The director of the CIA -- the

19

government, I don't believe, disputes that

20

that's a civil office.

21

authorized that office to be held by a military

22

officer.

23
24
25

Congress has expressly

And so the question -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

How

have they done that?
MR. VLADECK:

There is a special -- a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1

separate section, I believe it's 10 U.S.C.

2

Section 528, Justice Sotomayor, where Congress

3

has said that the CIA director may be a

4

military officer, without any consequence

5

inuring to his military service, without losing

6

his commission, without losing benefits,

7

without losing rank or pay or anything else.

8

The government argues here that the

9

Military Commissions Act itself provides

10

comparable authorization, that Congress when it

11

allowed military officers to be assigned to the

12

CMCR was showing similar approval.

13

And, frankly, again, I think that

14

misstates the distinction between being

15

assigned to exercise additional duties,

16

Congress clearly did authorize military

17

officers to be assigned additional duties as

18

CMCR judges, and being appointed to a second

19

office.

20

There's no language in the Military

21

Commissions Act, especially the provision that

22

refers to the appointment of additional judges,

23

that's Section 950f(b)(3) -- and I apologize

24

for the number of section numbers and

25

acronyms -- there's no language in that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

provision, Justice Sotomayor, that comes

2

anywhere near suggesting that in 2009 Congress

3

was thinking about military officers when it

4

created this separate appointed office that it

5

was allowing additional judges to hold.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

What about 9 -- what

7

about -- I mean, there are a lot of statutory

8

hurdles you've got to get over.

9

What about 973(d), which delegated to

10

the Secretary of Defense the authority to

11

prescribe regulations to implement the ban on

12

dual office holding, and the Secretary has said

13

in regulations that, under -- the "actions

14

undertaken by a member in carrying out assigned

15

military duties shall be invalidated solely by"

16

-- by virtue of such member "having held or

17

exercised the function of a civil office in

18

violation of the prohibitions" of 973(b).

19

MR. VLADECK:

So I -- I think -- I

20

thank you for pointing out the directive.

I

21

think the key language in the directive is

22

actually the provisions at Sections 4.6, which

23

you will find at pages 18a and 19a of the blue

24

brief.

25

Alito, is the directive says we, the Defense

And what the directive does, Justice

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

Department, are recognizing circumstances -­

2
3
4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Where is this, I'm

sorry?
MR. VLADECK:

I'm sorry, it's pages

5

18a and 19a of the blue brief in the appendix.

6

The directive was the Secretary's response to

7

the provision Justice Alito cited, to Section

8

973(d), which delegated to the Secretary of

9

Defense the power to promulgate regulations to

10
11

enforce Section 973.
And, Justice Alito, I think it's

12

telling that the Secretary's response, and this

13

is page 18a of the blue brief -- was to

14

delineate eight specific categories of cases

15

where termination of the officer's military

16

status was not to be the consequence, basically

17

reflecting the Vietnam era concerns that the

18

government raised in its brief, identifying

19

circumstances where the -- the remedy for a

20

violation of the statute was not going to be

21

forfeiture of military office.

22

What -- I'm sorry.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why -- I'm just

24

curious why -- why is this a civil office?

25

This thing is -- can you hear me?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

MR. VLADECK:

I can.

Thank you,

2

Justice Breyer.

3

I want to make sure I get back to Justice

4

Alito's question, but on -­

5
6
7

So on -- on civil office, and

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, go ahead and

finish that first.
MR. VLADECK:

So, Justice Alito, as we

8

say in our reply brief, it would have made no

9

sense, there would have been no need for the

10

Secretary to identify the eight circumstances

11

in which a military officer was not going to

12

have to surrender his military office, if the

13

1983 statute did, in fact, as the government

14

argues, categorically eliminate termination as

15

a consequence.

16

If I might turn to Justice Breyer's

17

question, with regard to civil office, for us,

18

of course, the key to concluding that an

19

appointed judge on the Court of Military

20

Commission Review holds a civil office is the

21

fact that Congress has created the office by

22

statute, that it exercises the sovereign

23

authority of the United States, and that it can

24

be held and, indeed, is held by civilians.

25

That is in contrast to the -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why -- why is that?

2

I mean, after all, Congress creates the

3

military by statute.

And it appoints all the

4

officers by statute.

And they're all confirmed

5

by -- by Congress.

6

And this is a Commission that normally

7

serves in areas where it could be under

8

civilian control, but the civilian courts are

9

not functioning, and, therefore, we have a

10

military commission serving the ordinary

11

officers.

12

Now, all those things seem military,

13

special, and if you want to know whether -- if

14

you want to use:

15

officers to serve on it, and in the absence of

16

that it's civil, they did.

Did Congress intend military

All right.

17

So -- so what's civil about it?

18

MR. VLADECK:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

So -­
I mean, except the

20

fact you mentioned, it's of course true, it is

21

of course true, that there is one civilian on

22

it or two or three.

23

That's true.

Is there anything that says a military

24

officer, which would otherwise be totally

25

military, suddenly becomes civil because you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
18
1

appoint one person who's civil?

2

MR. VLADECK:

Well, I would start -- I

3

would start, Justice Breyer, with the

4

government's definition of what a military

5

office is.

6

definition, the Court of Claims, we cite this

7

in our brief, has long been defined by rank,

8

title, pay, and command.

9

A military office, the government's

And, of course, judges who are

10

appointed to the Court of Military Commission

11

Review have only one of those things, pay,

12

which, of course, is itself distinct.

13

But to the point that I -- I took your

14

question to be asking about the function, the

15

government makes much of the claim that the

16

Court of Military Commission Review is

17

exercising a classic military function, and I

18

think it's worth stressing it's actually

19

neither classic nor military.

20

There had never been appellate review

21

of military commissions until 2005.

And up

22

until that point, and to this day, the

23

principal judicial review of military

24

commissions on the battlefield or off, Justice

25

Breyer, has been by civilian judges, whether

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
19
1

collaterally through habeas corpus or whether

2

on direct appeal in the court-martial system to

3

the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, a

4

court staffed by civilians, or as Congress

5

contemplated in the Military Commissions Act

6

through the CMCR to the D.C. Circuit, a court

7

also staffed by civilians.

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

In the Civil War, I

think you had military commissions, didn't you?

10

MR. VLADECK:

There were military

11

commissions, Justice Breyer.

12

mechanism for appeal.

13

There was no

The only -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

So you want us to

14

distinguish between appeal and just carrying

15

out a trial?

16

MR. VLADECK:

Well, I think -- I think

17

the distinction is structural, Justice Breyer.

18

So a military commission, like a court-martial,

19

is not a stand-in court.

20

record.

21

It is governed by the military.

22

It is not a court of

It is created solely by the military.

Congress when it created the

23

predecessors to the CCAs in 1950 and the

24

predecessor to the court of appeals, when

25

Congress created this structure, Congress was

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
20
1

intentionally mapping on to the court-martial

2

system, civilian appellate review.

3

And the purpose of that was not

4

because it was viewed as classically a military

5

function but because Congress was of the view

6

that we needed civilian judges exercising

7

oversight.

8
9

But one last point, just back to the
beginning of the statute, in 1873, three years

10

after the statute was written, the Attorney

11

General concluded that the Secretary of War,

12

who holds about as military an office as I can

13

think of, nevertheless held a civil office for

14

purposes of this very statute.

15

And that I think reflects, Justice

16

Breyer, the long-standing view that civil

17

office in this context is meant to be construed

18

capaciously.

19

it's part of why in 1983 Congress added the

20

three limiting criteria, that the civil office

21

require -- has to require an election or an

22

appointment by the President and confirmation

23

by the Senate or one of the offices listed in

24

the executive schedule, because the standalone

25

term, civil office, had been read so

Back to Justice Alito's question,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

capaciously.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there anything

3

incompatible about serving on a CCA, which

4

deals with ordinary court-martials, and service

5

on the CMCR, which deals with enemy combatants?

6

MR. VLADECK:

So, I mean, certainly,

7

Justice Ginsburg, we think there's first, of

8

course, statutory incompatibility, that the

9

dual office holding ban, if read correctly,

10

creates a statutory incompatibility where any

11

functional incompatibility is actually a

12

secondary consideration.

13
14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But is there any

functional?

15

MR. VLADECK:

So we -- we suggest that

16

there is.

I mean, indeed, this is why we think

17

that the government's position, even if one

18

were to accept it, raises serious separation of

19

powers concerns because you have the specter of

20

an officer who is a principal officer over here

21

on one court and an inferior officer over here

22

on another court, serving with similar staffs,

23

interacting with similar officers in the

24

appellate counsel's office, for example, in

25

both the government -- the prosecution and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
22
1

defense side.

2

And so we think that there's a reason

3

why the government has been unable to identify

4

a single example of this kind of dual office

5

holding in American history.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What is the

7

big deal, though?

What is the big problem with

8

being a principal officer in one context and an

9

inferior officer in the other?

10

MR. VLADECK:

There's no default -­

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's not like

12

you're branded one or the other and you carry

13

it around with you wherever you go.

14

MR. VLADECK:

No, of course not, Mr.

15

Chief Justice.

And it's not our suggestion

16

that it's a categorical incongruity.

17

is simply that if you disagree with our

18

interpretations of the relevant statutes, and

19

if you conclude that there is, in fact, no

20

problem today with this particular arrangement,

21

in this context, there might be a unique

22

concern of incongruity because, Mr. Chief

23

Justice, of the overlapping personnel, because

24

of the sensitivities of the command structure,

25

because of the very real possibility that

Our point

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
23
1

individuals with different authority on

2

different courts might not intentionally, but

3

just by being there, unduly influence the

4

actions of those who are subordinate to them in

5

one context but perhaps their peers in another.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Vladeck, you

7

didn't raise the amici's point, but what

8

position do you take with respect to that

9

point?

10

MR. VLADECK:

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

So -­
I know you don't

-- I know you don't want to be non-suited -­

13

MR. VLADECK:

No, no.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- but -- but I

15

trust -- I trust your independent judgment that

16

you'll give us your views on that presented

17

question.

18

MR. VLADECK:

And -- and I'm mindful

19

that my federal courts class begins tomorrow.

20

So -­

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

MR. VLADECK:

Yes.

-- the -- the -- with

23

regard to the amicus's point about

24

constitutional appellate jurisdiction, I think

25

it's worth starting from this Court's decision

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
24
1

in United States versus Coe, which, frankly, I

2

did not know about before this case.

3

Coe is an 1894 decision which we cite,

4

which the government cites in its brief, where

5

this Court expressly upheld its appellate

6

jurisdiction from the Article I Court of Public

7

Land Claims.

8
9

And the -- the government -- I'm
sorry, the -- the appellant in error in that

10

case moved to dismiss the case in the Supreme

11

Court on the ground that this Court lacked

12

constitutional appellate jurisdiction because

13

the relief that the government was seeking in

14

that case was tantamount to what it had sought

15

in Marbury.

16

And this Court expressly rejected that

17

argument.

18

unanimous court, when Congress has exercised

19

its power to lawfully create a non-Article III

20

federal tribunal -- the quote is -- "it

21

follows" that Congress may vest this Court with

22

direct appellate authority to do that.

23

As Chief Justice Fuller wrote for a

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

How -- how is that

24

different from the National Labor Relations

25

Board or the SEC?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
25
1

MR. VLADECK:

So, Justice Kennedy, I

2

think there are a couple of differences.

3

First, of course, Congress has never purported

4

to describe the NLRB or the SEC as a court.

5

is -­

6
7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's just labels

we're talking about?

8
9

It

MR. VLADECK:

No.

So, of course, the

label is not sufficient, but we think it is

10

probative.

11

choose to define a tribunal as a court of

12

record, what that means, of course, is that the

13

court exists independent of the officers who

14

staff it.

15

So, for example, when Congress does

It means the court is capable of

16

receiving process on its own without the

17

officers who attend to it.

18

of course, a writ of certiorari -­

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And at common law,

You mean the NLRB

20

doesn't exist -- if there's a vacancy, there's

21

no NLRB anymore?

22

MR. VLADECK:

If it's inchoate, it's

23

quite possible that the NLRB would not be able

24

to hand down decisions.

25

But, Justice Kennedy, the larger point

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
26
1

is we don't think this Court needs to reach

2

what is obviously the much harder question of

3

direct appellate jurisdiction over adjudicative

4

proceedings by an agency here because here,

5

unlike in the NLRB and SEC cases, you have

6

Congress creating a court of record, a court of

7

record, mind you, that is capable of dispensing

8

capital punishment.

9

And -­

10

These are criminal cases.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah, but that isn't

11

the issue.

12

being raised is what Justice Kennedy said.

13

There are many, many, many adjudicatory bodies

14

in the executive branch.

15

The issue I think is -- that's

And what the amicus says is if you

16

don't want to have jurisdiction by cert

17

directly from all of those, rather than through

18

a court of appeals or a habeas court, if you

19

don't want that because you think that is

20

inconsistent with separation of powers, then

21

you'd better find a way or a reason or a

22

sensible difference between this case and the

23

NLRB and the SEC.

24

says is that Coe and the other cases that have

25

upheld it -- I'm not sure how he deals with

And what -- what the amicus

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
27
1

Palmore; I don't know about the D.C.

2

to ask about that.

3

I'll have

But the -- the -- the -- leaving that

4

to the side, they all not only have the

5

attributes of a -- of a court, but they also

6

have jurisdiction over a territory.

7

think that that is what he sees in the prior

8

cases.

9

right?

10

Now, I

And he says that is not true here.

All

Now, if you do not agree with that,

11

why?

12

you would bring in all the NLRB, then say it.

13

If you have a different test, why?

MR. VLADECK:

If

So, again, I -- first of

14

all, let me take those in order if I might,

15

Justice Breyer.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. VLADECK:

19

It's one question.

Indeed, although I hope

you'll indulge me in multiple sentences.

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. VLADECK:

The -- the -- with

22

regard to the territorial point, I think it's

23

worth reminding this Court of its decision in

24

Palmore, where Justice White went out of his

25

way to uphold jurisdiction over the D.C. Court

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
28
1

of Appeals because the territorial courts

2

looked like military courts.

3

to say the analogy between the military and

4

territorial courts is actually deeply embedded

5

in this Court's non-Article III jurisprudence.

6

And so I think actually there's quite

7
8
9

Right?

That is

decent overlap between the two.
With regard to how this Court could
distinguish and save for another day the

10

question of when Congress could give it direct

11

appellate jurisdiction over an administrative

12

tribunal, I do think the fact that Congress has

13

called the Court of Appeals for the Armed

14

Forces a court of record, that it acts like a

15

court of record, and that it dispenses

16

judgments in criminal cases are all reasons

17

that distinguish it from administrative

18

adjudication.

19

And if we're really focused on Chief

20

Justice Marshall in Marbury, I think it's worth

21

reiterating that just four years after Marbury,

22

in Ex parte Bollman, the Chief Justice went out

23

of his way to distinguish cases in which this

24

Court was asked to review the decisions of a

25

lower court by which a citizen has been

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
29
1

committed to jail.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Does the President -­

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

I thought the court

4

of record was a court -- for years, I must have

5

been under a misapprehension.

6

appeals courts of the circuits are not courts

7

of records but the district courts are.

8

that is because in the district courts, there

9

is a record.

I thought the

And

There is a -- a notary, there's a

10

person there who takes -- here -- and -- and

11

the courts of appeals, the discussion such as

12

here, though we have it recorded, it's not

13

necessarily a record.

14

appeals, it certainly isn't.

15

MR. VLADECK:

And in the courts of

I'm -- I'm fairly sure,

16

Justice Breyer, that the circuit courts are

17

also courts of record.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. VLADECK:

Because?

Because they are

20

standard tribunals that produce records, that

21

produce transcripts, that produce proceedings

22

--

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

MR. VLADECK:

25

Okay.

-- independent of the

participants.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
30
1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

2

MR. VLADECK:

And judgments.

And judgments.

And -­

3

and one last point, Justice Kennedy, on

4

judgments.

5

the judgments piece is part of this.

6

three years ago, this Court in the B&B Hardware

7

case, I think, saw the difficulties of adopting

8

a bright-line rule for when administrative

9

adjudications would or would not be preclusive.

10

I do think, Justice Breyer, that

That is not true here.

I mean,

There is no

11

question in the CAAF -- in the court-martial

12

system that when the Court of Appeals for the

13

Armed Forces issues a judgment, it is binding,

14

it is preclusive, it is usually sending a

15

service member to prison, and perhaps it's even

16

leading to a capital sentence.

17
18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you think Marbury

versus Madison is right?

19

(Laughter.)

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Particularly as to

21

the interpretation with such exceptions as

22

Congress may make.

23

MR. VLADECK:

So, I will confess,

24

Justice Kennedy, that I may perhaps belong in

25

the school of scholars who thinks that Chief

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
31
1

Justice Marshall read both the statute and the

2

Constitution to reach the constitutional

3

questions he wanted to reach.

4

I'm not sure that he nevertheless

5

didn't end up with the right -- with the wrong

6

answer.

7

the question presented in this case on this

8

Court's jurisdiction, the more relevant case is

9

not Marbury but Bollman.

10
11

And if I may, Mr. Chief Justice, I'd
like to reserve my time.

12
13
14

And, again, I think, for purposes of

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
counsel.
Mr. Bamzai.

15
16
17
18

Thank you,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ADITYA BAMZAI,
AS AMICUS CURAE, IN SUPPORT OF NEITHER PARTY
MR. BAMZAI:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, may it please the Court:

19

This Court lacks Article III

20

jurisdiction to issue the writs in these cases.

21

The CAAF is an executive branch entity,

22

something that I believe the government does

23

not dispute.

24

executive branch officials is necessarily

25

original, not appellate, as established by

This Court's direct review of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
32
1

Marbury itself.

2

These two propositions decide this

3

case.

4

made the argument by analogy to the territorial

5

and D.C. courts, and that's the principal and,

6

in fact, it's the only argument on which they

7

rely, but it's very important for this Court to

8

understand that that is a slippery slope to go

9

down because territorial and D.C. government is

10
11

Now, my friends on the other side have

very different in a number of respects.
And so, for example, I understood the

12

Court to be asking, well, if -- if the Court

13

were to apply the territorial cases, such as

14

United States versus Coe, permitting review

15

from the highest court in the territory to

16

military courts, then wouldn't that open up the

17

possibility that review would be permissible

18

from other adjudicatory bodies in the federal

19

agencies, many of which can be characterized as

20

courts under the definition offered by my

21

friend, such as the tax court.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well -­

I'm sorry.

Except

24

that unlike those other agencies, territories,

25

this D.C. court, and military organizations are

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
33
1

explicitly -- Congress explicitly authorized to

2

-- to file rules and regulations.

3

provisions are almost identical.

4

The three

And why aren't military courts

5

virtually geographic?

6

happen in bases domestically or in foreign

7

fields.

8

geographically?

9

Most military operations

So in what ways are they different

MR. BAMZAI:

Your answer -- Your

10

Honor, a couple of answers to that.

11

is that they're not geographic in the sense in

12

which the territorial or D.C. courts are, where

13

we have courts of general jurisdiction that

14

step in for state courts where no state

15

apparatus is available.

16

The first

And so that is the rationale that this

17

Court has given in a number of its territorial

18

court cases.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, we've also

20

said, with respect to military justice, that it

21

-- it is -- that it is the jurisdiction -­

22

jurisdiction of the commander in charge of

23

either that base or that division.

24

those ways, civil law doesn't apply either.

25

MR. BAMZAI:

So, in

Your Honor, it's true

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
34
1

that civil law doesn't apply.

2

law that is applicable in these courts-martial.

3

But I don't think we're talking about

4

territorial jurisdiction in the same way that

5

we are with respect to territorial governance.

6

It's military

And if we were, then, as I pointed out

7

in my motion for oral argument time, the

8

government's position is that the appointments

9

clause does not apply to the territories where

10

currently sitting in jurisdiction in which the

11

mayor is elected.

12

from the ordinary separation of powers could

13

possibly be applicable within the military

14

system.

15

And none of those departures

So there must be some narrower

16

principle to explain, and this Court will have

17

to draw a distinction between the territorial

18

schemes of governance and the military and

19

other schemes of governance in federal

20

agencies.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I -- I

22

understand your argument that they're different

23

because of -- but I don't understand what

24

possible pertinence the fact that they cover a

25

territory as opposed to a subject matter has to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1
2

do with your Article III objection.
MR. BAMZAI:

Your Honor, it's both.

3

It's the -- the -- the reason why territorial

4

courts were created, and this is Chief Justice

5

Marshall's opinion in American Insurance versus

6

Canter points this out, that -- that Article

7

III courts, under the understanding of Article

8

III at the time, may not have been able to

9

resolve certain disputes that were necessary,

10

just in order to govern a group of people, such

11

as divorce disputes, things of that nature.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

doctrine wouldn't apply if, you know, the

14

Article III Court couldn't do it, then you'd

15

have to say it's all right for them to do it in

16

a way that seems inconsistent with your theory?

17

MR. BAMZAI:

So your

Not at all, Your Honor.

18

What I'm -- what I'm pointing out is that the

19

territorial courts were created for a certain

20

reason, and that is that they stepped into the

21

shoes of state courts where state courts were

22

not available.

23

And that explains why certain

24

principles of the structural separation of

25

powers don't apply within the territories and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
36
1

D.C.

It also -­

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess I don't

3

understand why the exact same rationale

4

wouldn't apply here.

5

a member of the military assaults somebody on a

6

military base and Congress decides:

7

want that assault to be prosecuted in the state

8

court.

9

within a military -- a system of military

10

In other words, you know,

We don't

We want that assault to be prosecuted

justice.

11

So Congress is essentially doing the

12

same thing.

13

not suited to decide some set of cases.

14

going to set up a different set of courts;

15

territorial, on the one hand; on this hand,

16

partly territorial but also defined by subject

17

matter.

18
19

Look, the regular state courts are

MR. BAMZAI:

We're

Your Honor, I think it is

--

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

21

MR. BAMZAI:

By people, really.

I think it is different

22

in relevant respects.

And the -- the Court's

23

decisions in this area have treated those -­

24

these two types of courts differently.

25

And so, for example, Ex parte

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
37
1

Vallandigham or the Gordon versus United States

2

case, which we cite in our brief, are about

3

military courts and about the initial

4

incarnation of the Court of Claims.

5

And this Court denied jurisdiction and

6

said that it could not directly review either

7

of those courts.

8
9

That contrasts with the Court's
approach to United States versus Coe from a

10

territorial court.

11

be a line that can be drawn between territorial

12

courts and these other types of adjudicatory

13

bodies that are within the executive branch.

14

And so there -- there must

And I submit that the line that I have

15

proposed is the easiest and best line that

16

explains all the cases, as well as allows the

17

-- the court to say that all bodies that are

18

within the executive branch cannot be subject

19

to this Court's direct review.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I go back to

21

the beginning of your argument?

22

the CAAF exercises original jurisdiction.

23

let me ask you first, does this case, cases

24

that come to the CAAF, arise under federal law?

25

MR. BAMZAI:

You said that

Yes, Your Honor.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

But

And if

Official
38
1

I may just say that I believe that this Court

2

exercises original jurisdiction in this case.

3

So I don't believe that the CAAF -­

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

then how does it get to be original

6

jurisdiction when the CAAF is an appellate body

7

that it is not making original, deciding in the

8

first instance, it is an appellate body, so it

9

goes to -- to the courts-martial and it goes to

All right.

Then -­

10

the CCA and then -- so that's one level of

11

review.

12

CAAF is a second level of review.

13

is exercising appellate jurisdiction.

14

hearing the case in the first instance.

15

MR. BAMZAI:

It

It's not

Your Honor, all of that

16

may be right, but for constitutional purposes,

17

the -- this Court is the first Article III

18

court to be reviewing an executive branch

19

decision.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21

made the CAAF an Article III court.

22

MR. BAMZAI:

constitutional, Your Honor.

completely alleviate the constitutional

problem.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

alleviate your concern here?

3

MR. BAMZAI:

constitutional problem.

6

with most of the federal -­

It wouldn't -- it

8

wouldn't affect the Commander-in-Chief

9

argument?

10

MR. BAMZAI:

11

some separate argument that I have not fully

12

explored.

And I don't have a position on that.

13

But -­

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm also worried

15

about the -- well, two things.

16

your -- your test, what about the D.C.?

17

the D.C. Circuit is the exercise of federal

do we explain the decision that's upholding

Okay.

Okay.

So I

2

got your point.

3

government's argument that what we should do is

4

look back to history and say the tradition at

5

the time of the writing of the Constitution

6

would have been to consider military justice as

7

a functioning judicial system, and that isn't

8

true of the NLRB and it isn't true of the other

9

agencies.

10

But now, what about the

And because they both have the

11

characteristics or many of the characteristics

12

of courts and would have been so considered

13

historically that it is appropriate to exercise

14

appellate jurisdiction from their decisions.

15

MR. BAMZAI:

Your Honor, respectfully,

16

I don't know if that is entirely the

17

government's position.

18

my friend.

You might want to ask

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. BAMZAI:

All right.

Yeah.

And that is because the

21

government appears to concede that this Court

22

in Ex parte Vallandigham held that it could not

23

directly -- directly review a military

24

commission in that case because the military

25

commission did not exercise the judicial power

MR. BAMZAI:

Thank you, Your Honor.

10

That the CAAF is relevantly different because

11

it has been codified by Congress and exercises

12

its authority in a more formalized sense than

13

the ad hoc military commissions in the

14

Vallandigham case, and I submit -­

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

When -- when we

16

write this opinion, whichever way we come out

17

on the issue you're arguing, will it be

18

necessary for us to define what a court is?

19

MR. BAMZAI:

Your Honor, it would not

20

be necessary.

21

to decide this case is the one that I proposed

22

in my opening, which is that it is undisputed,

23

I believe, the government does not dispute that

24

the CAAF is within the executive branch.

25

I submit that the simplest way

And this Court could simply say that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
43
1

its direct review of the executive branch is

2

necessarily -­

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but how does

4

that really fit with the language of Article

5

III, Section 2?

6

is "The judicial power shall extend to all

7

cases" and then talks about in those cases or

8

in various ones of them, "the Supreme Court

9

shall have appellate jurisdiction."

10

Because what Article III says

Now there might be uncertainty as to

11

what cases means with respect to a good many

12

things, but I would have thought that when

13

we're talking about the proceeding here, which

14

is a criminal prosecution with big criminal

15

sentences, including the death penalty, I would

16

have thought that those criminal prosecutions

17

are indeed cases under the language of Article

18

III.

19

MR. BAMZAI:

Your Honor, I think the

20

answer to that question is that Marbury

21

establishes that it's more than simply a case

22

that triggers this Court's jurisdiction, that

23

there's something to the language of original

24

and appellate, and original jurisdiction

25

because it's specified in the Constitution by

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
44
1

implication means that appellate jurisdiction

2

can only be exercised from certain types of

3

bodies.

4

And, incidentally, that is not only

5

the position that Chief Justice Marshall

6

embraced in Marbury, but it's also the position

7

that Alexander Hamilton embraced in the

8

Federalist Papers, it was proposed at a number

9

of the state conventions ratifying the

10

Constitution and embraced by a number of the

11

cases that the Court decided in its early years

12

that are cited in our brief.

13

And so I think that answers why it's

14

not simply a matter of a case, and one could

15

understand the dispute between Marbury and

16

Madison -­

17
18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, if I understand

your answer -­

19

MR. BAMZAI:

Yes.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- you're not pointing

21

to anything in Article III, is that correct?

22

You're pointing instead to Marbury and saying

23

that the principle derives from there, but I

24

could look at Marbury and say:

25

-- what Chief Justice Marshall was talking

You know, what

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

about was James Madison handing around

2

commissions, nothing to do with criminal

3

prosecutions.

4

MR. BAMZAI:

Your Honor, I do believe

5

that I'm pointing to something in Article III,

6

and that's the original and appellate

7

jurisdiction provisions and the appropriate

8

structural inferences that can be made from

9

that.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But -- but that's all

11

with reference to the cases.

13

these various cases.

14

you know, which particular courts or whether

somebody's exercising which particular powers.

MR. BAMZAI:

It doesn't talk about,

That is true.

That's

18

true.

It does not say which particular courts.

19

It is not specified in so many words.

20

Marbury has that principle, as does, for

21

example, Justice Story in his Commentaries on

22

the Constitution, in which he says that

23

appellate jurisdiction must be exercised from a

24

body that is exercising judicial authority and

25

cloaked with judicial power.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

But

Official
46

And so I think that that principle was

embraced by the people who wrote Article III,

and it's a principle that this Court ought to

apply in this case.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHER

9

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

10
11
12

MR. FLETCHER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
Because a question has been raised

13

about this Court's jurisdiction, I'd like to

14

start by explaining why, in the government's

15

view, Section 1259 validly grants this Court

16

appellate jurisdiction to review the Court of

17

Appeals for the Armed Forces' decisions.

18

then I'd like to turn to the merits and explain

19

why Judges Burton, Celtnieks, Herring, and

20

Mitchell did not violate Section 973(b) when

21

they accepted presidential appointments to the

22

Court of Military Commission Review and also

23

why any violation that did occur would not have

24

ejected those officers from the military or

25

provided any other basis for invalidating their

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official
47
1

decisions upholding the court-martial

2

convictions at issue here.

3

On the jurisdictional question, we

4

start, as I think all the parties before the

5

Court do, with Chief Justice Marshall's

6

decision for the Court in Marbury versus

7

Madison, which says that the essential

8

criterion of appellate jurisdiction is that it

9

revises and corrects the proceedings in a cause

10

already instituted and does not institute that

11

cause.

12

Under that standard, Marbury was an

13

original case because the parties came to this

14

Court in the first instance and asked for an

15

order directing the delivery of a commission.

16

If you read the report of the decision before

17

you get to the Chief Justice's opinion, you

18

find this Court taking evidence by affidavit

19

and ruling on objections, hearing testimony,

20

essentially.

21

That was an original action.

This

22

case, by contrast, is an appellate action

23

because it comes to the Court on review of the

24

Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces'

25

decision, which reviewed a criminal proceeding

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
48
1

that originated in courts-martial and that

2

proceeded through the separate military justice

3

system that has existed in some form in our

4

country since the founding of it.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There are a lot of -­
What is the -­

7

what -- how would you have us distinguish the

8

situation that people are concerned about,

9

which is every alphabet agency in the

10

government, that Congress says you can appeal

11

from the sanctions that the SEC imposes right

12

to the Supreme Court?

13

MR. FLETCHER:

Yes.

That's -- our

14

view is that that would not be a valid grant of

15

appellate jurisdiction if Congress purported to

16

do that.

17

think this Court should adhere to in this case

18

and the rule we think resolves this case is the

19

one from Coe, the 1894 decision that my friend

20

quoted, that dealt with a challenge to this

21

Court's appellate jurisdiction over a

22

territorial court.

23

And the reason why the rule that we

And what the Court said was if

24

Congress in those limited circumstances where

25

Congress can create courts outside the scope of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
49
1

Article III, then it can also vest this Court

2

with jurisdiction to review their decisions.

3
4
5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

So it

creates the -- the NLRB court of final review?
MR. FLETCHER:

Well, I -- I don't

6

think it could do that, Mr. Chief Justice,

7

because, as this Court's decisions elucidate,

8

there are only very limited circumstances where

9

Congress can create courts outside of the

10
11

context of Article III.

The two -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, in other

12

words, it's -- it's okay because -- we don't

13

have to worry because you can only do it in

14

cases where they've already done it?

15

MR. FLETCHER:

Well, you can only do

16

it -- I think what we would do is we would link

17

the rule about when is this Court's

18

jurisdiction appellate versus original to the

19

existing jurisprudence that this Court has

20

about when can Congress create courts outside

21

of the Article III system.

22

paradigmatic cases where it's uncontroversial

23

and well settled that Congress can do that are

24

the territories and the military system.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And the two

But when can

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
50
1

they not do it?

2

more than just saying everything they have done

3

so far is okay and nothing else, then -- then

4

what is the rule for telling them when they can

5

create these courts under Article I?

6

If -- if you're doing anything

MR. FLETCHER:

So what this Court has

7

said -- and, again, I -- I just want to

8

illustrate that that's -- that's a question

9

that the Court is going to have to grapple with

10

however it resolves the appellate jurisdiction

question here.

12

presumably again in the future have to confront

13

the question when can Congress create

14

non-Article III courts.

15

It has other cases and will

All that we're saying is that what

16

follows from that is if the Court decides in

17

that context that Congress can create a

18

non-Article III court, then it can also vest

19

appellate jurisdiction in this Court to review

20

that court's decisions.

And the -­

8

they could, Justice Kennedy.

I don't know that

grappled with but didn't resolve the question

15

whether review of a decision by a circuit

judicial council was appellate jurisdiction.

17

And the question it was asking is, is what the

18

circuit judicial council is doing

19

administrative or is it instead judicial?

20

I can tell you the question has

JUSTICE BREYER:

There was a

What we're doing is

21

looking, I think -- at least I am, I think

22

others are too -- for a reason; that is, what

23

is it that -- that -- I can see the states.

24

You say -- the easiest is the federal courts.

25

I mean, Congress has judicial authority who

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
52
1

exercises it.

2

jurisdiction over state courts?

3

states have sovereignty, and they can, in the

4

exercise of their sovereignty, create a

5

judicial system.

6

Well, how can we have appellate
That's because

Well, what about territories?

Well,

7

territories, that's a tougher one because it

8

looks like it's Congress's sovereignty, but it

9

isn't.

That is to say, sovereign -­

10

territories are the equivalent of states before

11

they are states.

12

territories create judicial systems.

13

the territorial courts are analogous to the

14

state courts.

15

Human societies on
And so

What about the D.C. Circuit?

Hmm -­

16

D.C. Court of Appeals, rather.

17

tougher one but maybe rather like the

18

territorial courts, like the state court.

19

And now what?

20

That's a

Hmm.

Okay?

And now he says I've used this

21

territorial principle, the sovereignty arising

22

in territories physically, which aspect of the

23

sovereignty is an authority to create a

24

judicial body, giving us appellate

25

jurisdiction.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
53
1

Now, military, you don't like that

2

territorial-based distinction because it's -­

3

territorial sovereignty based distinction

4

because they don't really have -- it's not

5

territories.

6

And so now we're looking for another

7

one.

That's a long question, but all I'm

8

asking for is, what is that other one?

9

Chief says it sounds like, which to me it did

10

sound rather like, whatever we've done in the

11

past is all right but not in the future.

12

-- and that's a historical one.

13

MR. FLETCHER:

And the

And

Hmm.

So let me say two

14

things about that.

15

way that this Court has approached territorial

16

courts and the D.C. court is not quite the way

17

Your Honor's addressed it.

18

And the first is that the

JUSTICE BREYER:

I know that, but

19

looking at Coe, it doesn't seem to give much of

20

an answer.

21

MR. FLETCHER:

Well, the answer that

22

it gives is appellate jurisdiction is review of

23

another court's decision -­

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

MR. FLETCHER:

Yeah.
-- at the most basic

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
54
1

level.

2

so, if you're asked when review of -- of

3

tribunals' decisions -- is it original or

4

appellate, the question is, is that tribunal -­

5

I think everyone agrees with that.

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

And

Well, at

6

that point, Justice Kennedy's question becomes

7

relevant to me.

8

Congress says the NLRB -- they used to be

9

called, you know, hearing examiners.

Then he says, all right,

And now

10

they're called ALJs, which is administrative

11

law judges.

12

court of ALJs, which we call a court, dot dot

13

--

And now what we do is produce a

14

MR. FLETCHER:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
-- and has

16

stenographers so it's of record, da da, you

17

see?

18

Now, that's the concern.
MR. FLETCHER:

Yes.

And the concern,

19

I think the answer -- let me say two things

20

about that.

21

might want to resolve the question between

22

legislative courts and the administrative

23

agencies like the NLRB, our view is that

24

military courts, the Court of Appeals for the

25

Armed Forces is on the territorial side of the

The first is I think, however you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
55

line, is on the clearer side of the line,

2

because this Court has always considered those

3

two to be together as the paradigmatic

4

examples under the circumstances -­

Well, have they,

though?

I mean, I look at

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

Justice Alito?

Do you -- do you think

12

it's relevant that the President or the

13

Secretary of Defense can alter a decision of

14

the CAAF after it's issued?

15

MR. FLETCHER:

I don't believe that

16

the President or the -- the Secretary of

Defense can do that.

18

authority, and this is described in 10 U.S.C.

19

876, to mitigate sentences, to commute or

20

reduce sentences.

21

They have some limited

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that's what I'm

22

referring to.

The convening authority shall

23

take action in accordance with the decision of

24

the CAAF unless there is to be further action

25

by the President or the Secretary concerned.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
56

2
3

MR. FLETCHER:

That's correct.

And

the further action -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

And you think that's

4

relevant to the question this, the question

5

before us?

6

MR. FLETCHER:

I -- I think it might

7

be if the action of the President or the

8

Secretary extended to upsetting the conviction

9

or upsetting the judgment of the CAAF, but

10

that's not the type of action that the

11

President can take.

12

thought about that in -­

And Congress actually

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

14

can the President take?

15

MR. FLETCHER:

What kind of action

There are certain types

16

of sentences, death sentences in particular,

17

that require the President's approval before

18

they can be executed, and there are other types

19

of sentences, including the dismissal of an

20

officer, that require secretarial approval

21

before they can be executed.

22

circumstances, the President or the Secretary

23

can commute those sentences to something less.

24

They can't upset the conviction.

25

In those

And so, in our view, the availability

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
57
1

of that relief from those officers is akin to

2

relief by commutation in the federal or state

3

system or to parole.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

How does that

provision work?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm not doubting

7

you, but where -- where do I look to find -- to

8

find the authority for your proposition?

9

MR. FLETCHER:

You find the -- the

10

statutory provision that speaks to the finality

11

of Court of Appeals of the Armed Forces'

12

decisions and court-martial decisions in

13

general is in 876.

14

provision that speaks to authority to reduce

sentences is in 874, but it's at least

referenced there.

And the -- I believe the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I -- I -- I

guess I am doubting you.

19

(Laughter.)

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If you have

21

the -- if the executive prevails in any case,

22

he always has the discretion not to enforce it.

23

I mean, if the judgment is you can, you know,

24

suspend the pay of this service person for this

25

period, he can review it and say, well, okay,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
58
1

you know, the -- the principle is established,

2

but I'm not going to do it.

3

he wins the authority; he prevails and can say,

4

okay, you can cashier the guy out of the

5

service, but he says, well, he's the best, you

6

know, gunnery sergeant in the -- that area, so

7

I'm not going to do it.

8

it's -- why he -- why you think he's

9

constrained in any particular way.

10

MR. FLETCHER:

Right?

Or he -­

I don't understand why

Well, I think he's -­

11

he's constrained.

12

Uniform Code of Military Justice sets up gives

13

the President some ability to reduce or

14

mitigate sentences but not others and otherwise

15

makes the decisions of the Court of Appeals for

16

the Armed Forces final and binding.

17

The -- the system that the

And, in fact, the language in the

18

provision that I was citing to Justice Kennedy

19

earlier is the language that you, Your Honor -­

20

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

21

MR. FLETCHER:

22
23

So -­

-- quoted in your

opinion in Denedo -­
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So, counsel, don't

24

we, though, have to assume the

25

constitutionality of that limitation on the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
59
1

President's authority as Commander-in-Chief for

2

-- for this position to work and, second, what

3

if Congress were to alter that scheme and

4

provide the -- the President or the Secretary

5

further authority to alter the results of

6

military tribunals?

7

Secretary, if I'm correct, has to approve the

dismissal of any commissioned officer as well

--

And, in fact, I think the

10

MR. FLETCHER:

That's correct, yes.

11

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

-- under 871(b).

So

12

there's another limitation on the authority of

13

the military tribunal and another grant to a

14

superior executive officer.

15

MR. FLETCHER:

So let me say two

16

things about that.

17

with you that if Congress gave greater

18

authority to executive branch officials to the

19

President or the Secretary to set aside

20

military or court-martial convictions, that

21

would change the analysis, but it would be -­

22

The first is I -- I agree

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, if it changes

23

the analysis, then where -- we're back to the

24

Chief Justice's question -- where is the line,

25

and assuming the constitutionality of these

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
60
1

limitations.

2

MR. FLETCHER:

Yes.

3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Where is the line?

4

How much authority -- how much of a court is it

5

before it is no longer a court when it's all

6

sitting in the executive branch, as this Court

7

ruled in Edmonds?

8
9

MR. FLETCHER:

So first and foremost

it's a court that doles out criminal sentences,

10

up to and including death.

11

an acquittal has double jeopardy effect.

Its

12

decisions are given res judicata effect.

are not things that the President or the

I'm saying, well, what about the

MR. FLETCHER:

I guess I would say the

fact that it can distribute criminal penalties

is certainly an indication that if we're

13

drawing a line, is it a court, is it not, it

14

falls on the court side of the line.

That's what it shares

17

in common with territorial courts.

But maybe we

Can we read the territorial cases

as -- as, looking at this, separately out of

the power to organize governments in the

The governments of a territory involve

an executive, legislative, and judicial

sovereign constitutional power under Article I,

6

in the power to organize governments and

7

territories, it is going to have the power to

8

organize courts of a kind that act like courts

and, therefore, appellate review.

Therefore, in exercising its

10

MR. FLETCHER:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
The same is true of

12

the military, which is a separate world, and it

13

is Article I giving them power over the

14

military that lets them do that.

15

MR. FLETCHER:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
The same is not true

17

of the NLRB, which is a specialized agency, and

18

because the judicial and adjudicatory functions

that the executive branch performs in its

carrying out of executive duties are

21

rule-making and decision-making authorities

22

under execution, not judicial.

So this -­

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Fletcher,

17

maybe it's a good time for us to let you get to

18

the merits of the case.

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. FLETCHER:

I appreciate that, Mr.

21

Chief Justice.

And I think, as some of the

22

questions earlier have suggested, in order to

23

obtain the relief that they're seeking,

24

Petitioners have to clear three hurdles on the

25

merits.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64
1

They have to show that the CMCR

2

judgeship is a civil office within the meaning

3

of Section 973.

4

Congress has not authorized by law military

5

officers to hold that office.

6

have to show that a violation of that statute,

7

if it occurred automatically, ejected these

8

officers from the military when they accepted

9

their appointments to the CMCR of May in 2006

They have to show that

And then they

10

and invalidated the officers' subsequent

11

decisions in Petitioners' criminal appeals on

12

the courts of criminal appeals.

13

view, they can't make any of those showings.

14

I'd like to start, if I could, with

And in our

15

the civil office question.

I think it's common

16

ground between the parties that by preventing

17

or precluding military officers from holding a

18

civil office, what Congress sought to do was to

19

prevent the -- to preserve the civilian

20

preeminence over the military, to prevent

21

military encroachment into the civil

22

government.

23

And so a civil office, as we

24

understand it and as the Department of Defense

25

has long defined it, is an office in the civil

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
65
1

government that exercises the powers or

2

authorities of the civil government.

3

non-military office.

4

It's a

Judged by that criterion, a judgeship

5

on the Court of Military Commission Review is a

6

military office.

7

Court of Military Commission Review is a

8

military court.

9

military officers have long performed, judging

As its name suggests, the

It performs a function that

10

violations of the law of war and other offenses

11

triable by military commission committed by

12

alien and enemy belligerence, and it performs a

13

function that's very, very similar to what in

14

the court-martial system is done by the courts

15

of criminal appeals, which are staffed by

16

military officers predominantly, although that

17

position can also be held by civilians, and

18

which this Court explained in Weiss performs a

19

function that is germane to military officers'

20

military office.

21

The Court in Weiss went through the

22

history of the military justice system in the

23

court-martial side of the house and explained

24

the role that military officers had long played

25

in that system, and it concluded that, as a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
66
1

result of that role, serving as a judge on the

2

court of criminal appeals is germane to holding

3

military office.

4

Obviously, the Court in Weiss did not

5

have in front of it Section 973, but we think

6

its conclusion on germaneness is very

7

instructive on this question because the Court

8

of Military Commission Review performs a

9

function that is very similar to the function

10

performed by the courts of criminal appeals.

11

It was expressly patterned on the

12

courts of criminal appeals and the statute

13

defining the circumstances under which it can

14

review a case, 950f.

15

verbatim from the statute for the courts of

16

criminal appeals, 866.

17

It is drawn almost

And just as military officers serving

18

on the court of criminal appeals are performing

19

a military function and are doing something

20

that is germane to their military duties,

21

that's also true when those same officers

22

perform essentially the same function in

23

another military court system.

24
25

And I think what that illustrates,
and, by the way, I don't understand my friend

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
67
1

to dispute that a judgeship on the court of

2

criminal appeals is a military office, not a

3

civil office of the sort that would be

4

contemplated in Section 973.

5

And what that shows is that even if an

6

office can be held by civilians, as the court

7

of criminal appeals judgeship can be, it is

8

still a military office if it's performing a

9

military function.

10

So judged by that standard, we think

11

Petitioners' claim fails on that first instance

12

because the Court of Military Commission Review

13

is not a civil office.

14

But even if you disagree with us on

15

that question, we also think that Congress has

16

authorized by law military officers to hold a

17

position on the Court of Military Commission

18

Review.

19

And the way that my friend approaches

20

Section 973 is through the lens of assigning

21

and appointing, and he wants to draw a sharp

22

distinction between assigning and appointment

23

and read that distinction into the prohibition

24

in Section 973.

25

But that's not a prohibition that's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
68
1

found in the language or the history of

2

Section 973.

3

that, "except as otherwise authorized by law,"

4

an officer "may not hold or exercise" the

5

functions of a civil office.

6

Instead, what the statute says is

So the concern is not with the manner

7

in which the officer ends up in the civil

8

office.

9

authorized military officers to hold or

10

The question is:

Has Congress

exercise the function of the civil office?

11

And in our view, Congress created a

12

single office when it created the Court of

13

Military Commission Review.

14

judged on the Court of Military Commission

15

Review.

16

950f.

17

That office is

That's the statutory term in Section

And Congress then authorized military

18

officers to serve on that court, to hold that

19

office in unambiguous terms, in Section

20

950f(b)(2), where it said that the Secretary of

21

Defense may assign persons who upheld military

22

judges to be judges on the Court of Military

23

Commission Review.

24
25

That's how all four of the judges who
are at issue here were first placed on the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
69
1

Court of Military Commission Review.

2

Now, it's true the D.C. Circuit in

3

Al-Nashiri raised questions about whether that

4

assignment, which was valid for all statutory

5

purposes, also complied with the appointments

6

clause.

7

the D.C. Circuit raised, the Senate and the

8

President heeded the D.C. Circuit's suggestion

9

that they avoid the need to resolve

And in response to the questions that

10

appointments clause questions and also appoint

11

those four officers to the Court of Military

12

Commission Review under Section 950b(3).

13

those appointments essentially ratify the

14

preexisting assignments and mean that now the

15

four judges serve on the Court of Military

16

Commission Review by virtue of both the

17

assignment of the Secretary of Defense and the

18

appointment of the President.

19

And

But in doing that, the President did

20

not create a problem, did not put those

21

officers in an office that they're not

22

authorized to hold by Congress.

23

ratified their placement in that office through

24

the means that Congress specified.

25

He just

And finally, just very briefly, we do

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
70
1

hope that the Court will answer the question,

2

the merits question, about whether or not a

3

CMCR judgeship is a civil office because it's

4

important to the government.

5

obligated to comply with the statute.

6

The government is

We believe that judges can validly

7

serve on the military -- excuse me, military

8

officers can validly serve on the Court of

9

Military Commission Review, but if this Court

10

disagrees, obviously, the government is going

11

to have to fix that problem.

12

So we hope that the Court answers the

13

question presented on the merits and holds that

14

973(b) does not prevent military officers from

15

serving on the CMCR, but in the event that you

16

disagree with us on that or you don't reach

17

that question, we think also that, as the Court

18

of Appeals for the Armed Forces held, any

19

violation of Section 973(b) that occurred would

20

not be a basis for invalidating the judges'

21

decisions on the court of criminal appeals.

22

And that's true for at least two reasons.

23

The first is that the Petitioners'

24

argument that it does invalidate their

25

decisions hinges on the premise that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
71
1

automatically upon the acceptance of a

2

prohibited civil office, the relevant officers

3

are ejected from the military.

4

That used to be the way the statute

5

worked, but for good reason Congress changed

6

that.

7

consequence.

8

It deleted that automatic termination

Now, when a violation of Section 973

9

occurs, the government and the officer have to

10

fix it by either giving up the military office

11

or giving up the civil office, but those things

12

happen as a result of administrative action

13

once the violation comes to light, not

14

retroactively and automatically by virtue of

15

the acceptance of the civil office.

16

And, second, and even more clearly -­

17

and I'll close -- close on this -- Congress

18

enacted a savings clause that says that nothing

19

in Section 973 can be used to invalidate the

20

actions of officers in furtherance of assigned

21

official duties.

22

what happens here -- what happened here.

23

And that perfectly describes

My friend is correct that it may also

24

describe what military officers do in civil

25

offices, for example, the special assistant

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
72
1

U.S. attorneys, JAG lawyers who are assigned to

2

be special assistant U.S. attorneys perform

3

civil functions in furtherance of their

4

assigned official duties.

5

But -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If your

6

reading of the authorization or the savings

7

clause is correct, then you really have no

8

reason to fix any problem that's been

9

identified, right?

10

MR. FLETCHER:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

you know, the person shouldn't be serving

13

there, but everything he does is okay, so we

14

don't have to remove him.

15

MR. FLETCHER:

Except -­
If you see,

Well, no, I think the

-- we think we are obligated to comply with the

17

that seriously.

19

enforcement of the civil office holding

20

prohibition, is that, as the Olson memo, for

21

example, that brought to light the violation

22

that had been happening before 1983, the

23

government raised the issue and then took

24

action to correct the issue.

25

And the executive branch does and takes
And that's the history of

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, how

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
73
1

would a problem -- how would a problem arise,

2

given the savings clause?

3

MR. FLETCHER:

Given the savings

4

clause, I think a problem would arise in the

5

way that problems arise.

6

statutes that apply to federal personnel

7

matters or that prohibit certain actions by

8

federal employees but don't invalidate their

9

actions as a result of the violation.

10

There are lots of

And the way that those things are

11

policed are by Inspector General, by

12

congressional oversight, and the Government

13

Accountability Office, by the Office of Legal

14

Counsel, and the lawyers within the agencies.

15

All of those things are still available.

16

And, indeed, the sources cited in the

17

briefs show that the government is taking

18

seriously its obligation to enforce the

19

statute.

20

That will continue.
And, in fact, the directive also that

21

we cite makes the acceptance of a civil office,

22

if an officer just goes out and does it, you

23

know, their own, without authorization, it

24

makes taking that action a violation of a

25

lawful order that is potentially subject to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
74
1

disciplinary action.

2

So there would -- there would

3

certainly be remedies, just not the drastic

4

remedy of ejectment from the military or

5

invalidation of official actions.

6

there's a good reason Congress why chose that

7

scheme, and we'd ask the Court to adhere to it.

8

If the Court has no further questions.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN I. VLADECK

14

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

15
16
17

MR. VLADECK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.
Just to briefly address one point on

18

jurisdiction before turning back to the merits,

19

the amicus relies on this Court's decision in

20

Vallandigham.

21

proves the point that both I and Mr. Fletcher

22

were trying to make.

I actually think Vallandigham

23

The Court in Vallandigham went out of

24

its way to explain why the military commission

25

itself was not "judicial" in the sense of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
75
1
2

Article III.
The analogy, of course, to this case

3

would be to the underlying court-martial

4

proceeding and not to the decisions by the

5

courts of criminal appeals or by the Court of

6

Appeals for the Armed Forces.

7

Turning to the merits, I think it's

8

important to stress the emptiness of the

9

government's suggestion that it has been

10

engaged in rigorous administrative enforcement

11

of the statute.

12

On its read-in of both Section

13

973(b)(5) and of the deletion of the automatic

14

termination provision, there is, in fact, no

15

consequence for violating a statute Congress

16

enacted to ensure civilian control of the

17

military, for protecting the civilians' fear of

18

government from having military officers

19

serving in all kinds of positions, and there

20

would be no remedy, especially in a case like

21

this one, where the problem at issue is not a

22

general objection to military officers serving

23

in administrative positions, but a very

24

specific objection to military officers serving

25

as judges.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
76
1

This Court has, for decades, suggested

2

that there are unique separation of powers

3

considerations and there are unique doctrinal

4

and common law reasons to take especially

5

seriously concerns that judges are acting

6

without authority.

7

It's why this Court in both the Ryder

8

case and Nguyen held that the de facto officer

9

doctrine does not apply to immunize at least

10

non-technical violations of judicial assignment

11

rules, and it's why the separation of powers

12

problem we have identified is especially

13

serious in this context.

14

One last point, though, the -- neither

15

-- the government doesn't talk about the -- did

16

not talk about the Commander-in-Chief clause in

17

its merits argument, but I think it's worth

18

stressing just how serious a Commander-in-Chief

19

clause problem a ruling in its favor could

20

create.

21

Under judges who are appointed to the

22

Court of Military Commission Review, under

23

Section 950f(b)(3), serve with good cause

24

removal protection.

25

they're military officers, they are insulated

What that means is if

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
77
1

from removal by good cause, which, of course,

2

takes them out of the chain of command.

3

Now, rather than suggest that that is

4

a constitutional constraint on the President as

5

Commander-in-Chief, the government argues that,

6

in fact, a judge who is appointed to the CMCR

7

by the President and confirmed by the Senate

8

can be reassigned by the General Counsel of the

9

Department of Defense.

10

There is no suggestion in the Military

11

Commissions Act that Congress intended such a,

12

frankly bizarre, reassignment scheme, and

13

there's no explanation for how that would solve

14

the Commander-in-Chief clause problem.

15

We agree that that question is not

16

squarely presented here because it would only

17

invalidate the ability of these judges to serve

18

on the Court of Military Commission Review.

19

But given that there is a petition for writ of

20

mandamus pending in the D.C. Circuit by two of

21

the defendants in the 9/11 trial, we think it

22

incumbent upon on this Court to reach the

23

merits question and not just rely on the

24

remedies consideration, even if it is inclined

25

to affirm the decisions below.
