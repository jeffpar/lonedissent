versus Zinke.

Mr. Gant.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT E. GANT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GANT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Section 2(b) of the Gun Lake Act is

12

unconstitutional because it is incompatible

13

with several well-established strands of this

14

Court's separation-of-powers jurisprudence as

15

well as with Article III itself.

16

2(b), Congress directed the federal courts to

17

dismiss a pending case otherwise properly

18

before the courts.

19

With Section

As a consequence of that directive to

20

dismiss with respect to Mr. Patchak's case, the

21

courts were prevented from performing their

22

constitutionally assigned responsibilities to

23

decide cases before them and to say what the

24

law is in the context of deciding those cases.

25

Section 2(b) is precisely the kind of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

legislative review of judicial decisions that

2

the framers rejected when they designed the

3

Constitution.

4

And all of -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Gant, when -- when

5

you say "directed that a case shall be

6

dismissed," are you referring only to the last

7

few words of this statute or are you referring

8

more broadly?

9

MR. GANT:

I'm referring to the -- to

10

the last -- the words that refer to dismissal

11

itself.

12
13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.

"And shall be

promptly dismissed."

14

MR. GANT:

Yes.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And then -­
Are you suggesting

16

that if those five words were not in the

17

statute, that the case would come out

18

differently?

19

MR. GANT:

I -- I am not suggesting

20

that.

I think it would still have come out

21

differently; for example, if you dropped the

22

reference to dismissal but left "maintain," the

23

result would be the same.

24

true if there had been a removal of judicial

25

review.

The same would be

In other words, if

just 2(a) but not 2(b), same result?

No.

That -- I understand

5

that to be a different question from Justice

Kagan's.

11

Part of the problem here -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But -- but if you had

13

2(b), finished, just "shall not be filed or

14

maintained in a Federal court," full stop,

15

you're saying that would be the same statute as

16

the one we actually have?

17
18

MR. GANT:

It -- it would still be

unconstitutional.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MR. GANT:

Yeah.

Now, the -- the omission of

21

the "shall be dismissed" language is not

22

without significance.

23

to explain.

25

And if I may, I'd like

The direction to dismiss is a
quintessential judicial function.

It's not

surprising that Black's Dictionary, in defining

2

dismissal, refers to it as especially a judge's

3

decision to stop the case.

4

That's -­

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

do with the McCardle case?

7

MR. GANT:

Well, what do you

McCardle was -- the fact

8

that a statute strips jurisdiction from a court

9

doesn't mean that it's immunized from review

10

under separation of powers.

11

touchstone has to be and the relevant strands

12

of the separation-of-powers jurisprudence at

13

issue here are -- are really two parts.

14

So the -- the

One is, has Congress exercised the

15

judicial power and/or has Congress prevented

16

the courts from fulfilling its constitutionally

17

assigned responsibilities?

18

have occurred here as a result of what is in

19

the actual 2(b), but the same result would

20

arise if you omitted just the words "shall be

21

dismissed."

22

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

I submit that both

But, Mr. -­
If this is a -- just a

24

jurisdiction-stripping statute, could you just

25

say as succinctly as possible what the rule is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

that you would like us to adopt?

2

-- the separation-of-powers rule that you would

3

like us to adopt with respect to a purely

4

jurisdiction-stripping statute?

5

MR. GANT:

What is the

Well, I -- I want to be

6

directly responsive to your question, but I

7

also want to say, and I've -- I've made this

8

observation in the briefs, I think the better

9

view is that it is not jurisdictional, and I'm

10

happy to elaborate on that later.

11

assume that it's a jurisdiction-stripping

12

statute -­

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

But if we

Well, on that,

14

suppose, following up on the initial questions,

15

if all that 2(b) said was that an action

16

relating to this land shall not be maintained

17

in a federal court, would you say that is not a

18

jurisdiction-stripping statute?

19

MR. GANT:

That --- that certainly

20

looks more like a jurisdiction-stripping

21

statute.

22

better view is it's not jurisdictional is -- is

23

at least twofold.

24
25

The reason I say that it's -- the

One is -- and I -- I have been accused
by some colleagues of taking Arbaugh too

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
8
1

seriously, but this Court went out of its way

2

in Arbaugh to announce to the world and to

3

Congress in particular that it wanted a new

4

rule, that if a court wanted a statute to be

5

viewed as jurisdictional, you needed to clearly

6

say so.

7

This statute doesn't say anywhere in

8

its text, in its headings, that it's

9

jurisdictional.

In fact, 2(b), the section

10

we're discussing that -- that arguably strips

11

jurisdiction from the courts, uses the phrase

12

"no claims."

13

My research may have been faulty, but

14

I couldn't find a single case using that

15

language in framing a jurisdictional statute.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if one of the

17

things that 2(b) does is to strip jurisdiction,

18

and if "shall not" -- "shall not be maintained"

19

is a jurisdiction-stripping provision, then I

20

don't see how you can win unless you have a

21

rule that applies to a jurisdiction-stripping

22

statute.

23

statute that are vulnerable, so they could be

24

severed.

25

Maybe there are other things in this

So, to go back to the question I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
9
1

asked, if this is a statute that takes away

2

federal court jurisdiction, what is your

3

separation-of-powers rule?

4

MR. GANT:

The rule -- the rule, I

5

submit, the Court should adopt is if a statute

6

is properly -- deemed as properly -- is

7

properly construed as a jurisdiction-stripping

8

statute, it is still subject to

9

separation-of-powers analysis.

That -- that

10

much is clear from Klein.

11

else about the case might be puzzling, Klein

12

clearly establishes that the mere fact that

13

Congress affixes the label "jurisdiction" to a

14

statute doesn't immunize it.

15

However, whatever

So then we return to our touchstone

16

principles here.

17

jurisdiction statute, Congress exercised the

18

judicial power and/or has it prevented the

19

courts from fulfilling their constitutionally

20

assigned responsibilities?

21

Has, through this

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah, but when -- as

22

succinctly as you can, Congress violates the

23

separation of powers when it deprives the

24

federal courts of jurisdiction in this

25

circumstance.

And what is the circumstance?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

MR. GANT:

The circumstance is when it

2

is directly, overtly deciding a case or

3

effectively deciding a case, rather than making

4

new law and leaving it to the courts to apply

5

the new law -­

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, let's -­

7

let's take -- which is not fictional, suppose

8

Congress enacts a statute that says a federal

9

court shall not have jurisdiction over cases

10

involving prayer in school.

11

constitutional?

12

MR. GANT:

It's

I think that raises serious

13

but -- but somewhat different questions.

Part

14

of what's offensive here to the

15

separation-of-powers principles is that

16

Congress is directing the outcome in a case.

17

It could be a set of cases.

18

And I submit, by the way, look -­

19

looking to Bank Markazi, if there had been

20

1,000 cases just like Patchak's, I think the

21

outcome would be the same.

22

was one case is, I think, probative of

23

assessing whether or not the Congress is

24

actually deciding a case, rather than actually

25

making the law to be applied by the courts.

So the fact that it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
11
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, if that's so, I

2

mean, I thought that you were suggesting a rule

3

that said, well, when you direct one case,

4

that's unconstitutional, but now you've just

5

said you're not saying that.

6

So, again, coming back to Justice

7

Alito's question, I mean, we know that Congress

8

can alter the jurisdiction of the federal

9

courts.

And we know that Congress can alter

10

that jurisdiction and apply it to pending

11

cases.

We've said that over and over again.

12

So what makes -- what would make this

13

unconstitutional if we assumed that this is a

14

jurisdiction-stripping statute?

15

MR. GANT:

Because what Congress has

16

done is affect directly here, but it could be

17

indirectly -- dictated the outcome of the case

18

without changing the law.

19

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

20

So, Mr. Gant, it's

that last clause -­

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, the law is the

22

jurisdictional law.

That's what Congress is

23

changing.

24

In so doing, Congress is changing the law.

25

haven't said Congress has to change, you know,

Congress is changing jurisdiction.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

We

Official
12
1

substantive law.

2

Here Congress is changing

3

jurisdictional law.

4

yesterday you had jurisdiction over a certain

5

category of cases.

6
7

Today you don't.

Now, why is that unconstitutional or
when is that unconstitutional?

8
9

It's saying, you know,

MR. GANT:

That is unconstitutional

when in the -- under the guise of -- of

10

changing the rules with respect to

11

jurisdiction, the court is effectively deciding

12

the case and then not letting the courts apply

13

the new law either.

14

So both things have occurred here.

15

So, in Bank Markazi and in Robertson, the

16

reason why those survive separation-of-powers

17

scrutiny was because they changed the law and

18

they left it to the courts to apply to new

19

cases.

20

You have the exact opposite here.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So, Mr. Gant, if I

21

understand it, the answer to the question, I

22

think, is that last clause, the dismiss -­

23

ordering the courts to dismiss the claim, that

24

up to that point, "shall not be filed or

25

maintained," if that's jurisdictional, as I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1

understand, you and your amici are okay with

2

that.

3

It's the directing the dismissal.
But if that -- if that's the only beef

4

we have, is that really a beef at all because

5

that's a natural consequence of a

6

jurisdiction-stripping statute as McCardle

7

itself, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, right,

8

so there's nothing left.

9

virtual quote from McCardle, right, there's

I think it's almost a

10

nothing left to be done but dismiss.

11

is the real beef here?

12

MR. GANT:

So where

Justice Gorsuch, I think

13

what the -- collectively, what the Court's

14

cases instruct us is that we shouldn't stop the

15

inquiry at the label.

16

We know that from Klein.

We know that

17

from other cases.

18

jurisdictional, but if -- if we assume that the

19

--

20

So this case isn't framed as

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Assume -- assuming

21

it's jurisdictional and all you're left with is

22

this complaint about the last clause, why

23

should we care?

24
25

MR. GANT:

We should care because then

what Congress is doing is it's -- it's giving

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

carte blanche to dictate the outcome of cases

2

just by affixing the label jurisdictional.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I -- I thought you,

4

in your response to Justice Kagan, you said it

5

wouldn't make any difference if those last

6

words were omitted, "shall be dismissed."

7

MR. GANT:

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9
10

Right.
You -- would have

the same objection.
MR. GANT:

I would have the same

11

objection -- let me be clear there.

12

respect to pending cases, so there -- the two

13

words that are operative here with respect to

14

pending cases are "shall not be maintained" and

15

"shall be dismissed."

16

the "filed."

17

With

I'm not talking about

So, with respect to prospective cases,

18

we're not arguing that Section 2(b) would be

19

unconstitutional because it wouldn't implicate

20

the -- the strands of the separation-of-powers

21

jurisprudence that I was discussing.

22

So it's with respect to pending cases

23

where both the shall not be -- may not be

24

maintained and shall be dismissed are both

25

operative -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I don't think that's

2

the question, Mr. Gant.

I think the question

3

is, and this was what I started with, would you

4

be making the same constitutional argument if

5

the last five words were not there?

6

you to say, yes, you would be making the same

7

constitutional argument, and in so doing, you

8

separated yourself from your amici because I

9

understand your amici, as Justice Gorsuch does,

And I took

10

as saying that everything hangs on that last

11

five words.

12

And you're suggesting that not

13

everything hangs on that last five words, that

14

you would have the exact same constitutional

15

objections if those five words weren't in the

16

picture.

17

Do I have you right?
MR. GANT:

Yes.

I think the fact that

18

it includes the dismissal term is -- makes it

19

particularly pernicious, so I would say that's

20

additional, pushing it even further beyond.

21
22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's like bad

atmospherics?

23

MR. GANT:

Well, it -- but it -- but

24

it's not just atmospherics.

25

suggested earlier, I think there's an argument

As I -- as I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

to be made that a direction from Congress to

2

the courts to dismiss a case is telling the

3

courts how to perform their duties in an

4

impermissible way.

And I also -­

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Counselor -­

But then you do get,

7

again, and I think that this is the underlying

8

premise of Justice Gorsuch's question, so take

9

out the last five words, and you were trying to

10

explain why what then just seems a

11

jurisdiction-stripping statute is

12

unconstitutional, in that -- against the

13

backdrop of very consistent precedent that we

14

have that says that Congress can take away the

15

jurisdiction of the federal courts and can do

16

so in a way that affects pending cases.

17
18

And -- and so why and when is that
unconstitutional?

19

MR. GANT:

Because you have to pierce

20

the label of jurisdiction and return to the

21

basic principles, which are:

22

exercising judicial functions or is it

23

preventing the judiciary from carrying out its

24

actions?

25

is Congress

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It seems that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1

we -- we've been replicating what, among

2

lawyers anyway, is a famous dialogue between

3

Professors Wechsler and Hart about whether

4

Congress can achieve unconstitutional

5

objectives by preventing federal courts from

6

adjudicating claims that those provisions are

7

unconstitutional.

8
9

You know, during the civil rights era,
there were a lot of proposals in Congress that

10

said the federal courts have no jurisdiction

11

over any case in which busing is sought as a

12

remedy.

13

consistently submitted whenever Congress

14

attempts to achieve an unconstitutional result

15

by depriving the federal courts of

16

jurisdiction.

And those types of proposals are

17

So I would have thought your answer is

18

-- is -- I would have thought you would have

19

taken the position that I understand to be

20

ascribed to Professor Hart in the dialogue,

21

which is that that is an indirect way of

22

achieving an unconstitutional result and is

23

subject to the same objection.

24

MR. GANT:
position.

That -- that is my

And I -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counselor, can I

2

-- I want to switch from personal jurisdiction

3

to sovereign immunity, in part for the reasons

4

that the Chief is -- Chief Justice is talking

5

about.

Okay?

6

MR. GANT:

Yes.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In Patchak I, I

8

took the position that the Court got sovereign

9

immunity wrong, and basically I argued -- the

10

majority disagreed -- that -- that the Quiet

11

Title Act really granted immunity.

12

majority disagreed and said this had to do with

13

APA waiver of immunity.

14

And the

I look at statutory history and this

15

new act, the Reaffirmation Act, was in the

16

context of that dispute in that case.

17

Congress did was settle the question, which I

18

believe it's entitled to do and is not

19

unconstitutional, it ratified the acts of the

20

Secretary's taking of this land, and by that

21

act, implicated the Quiet Title Act.

22

And what

And so, if it did that, I see this -­

23

and I don't understand why it's not, that

24

waiver of sovereign immunity that the Court did

25

not recognize in Patchak I.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
19

And I raise this for two reasons:

2

One, I do think there's a difference between

3

the Congress coming in between two private

4

parties and directing a result in favor of one

5

private party.

6

separation-of-powers question and a very, very

7

serious one.

8
9

I think that's a quintessential

But I think there is something
fundamentally different about suits involving

10

the government because sovereign immunity -- or

11

any suit against the government is a matter

12

only of largesse and -- and the government's

13

voluntary choice.

14

We have repeatedly through the

15

centuries said the government can at any moment

16

take away its sovereign immunity.

17

away that niceness of giving you the immunity.

18

It can take

So I see the potential of less of a

19

problem with separation of powers if -- if the

20

government has withdrawn sovereign immunity

21

22

parties.

23

let the government do that.

24

MR. GANT:

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I would be really frightened if we

Well, I -­
But -- so, given

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
20
1

that statutory history, the only issue that was

2

left alive or was at issue in Patchak I, given

3

that the waiver of sovereign immunity that was

4

taken away tracks the APA language, the APA's

5

language says that a suit can be maintained

6

against the government, why isn't this a

7

sovereign immunity case?

8

11

Why am I dealing with personal
jurisdiction at all or separation-of-powers
questions at all?

Well, it doesn't have to,

All of the

MR. GANT:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The whole fight in

Patchak I was over the existence or

2

non-existence of sovereign immunity.

3

MR. GANT:

But given that, and of

4

course the statutory history is to some extent

5

in the eye of the beholder, I look at it and I

6

see, given the history that you've just

7

outlined, that if what Congress had intended to

8

do was to restore sovereign immunity, there

9

would have been more evidence of that.

10

It wasn't mentioned anywhere in any of

11

the -- the hearings.

12

the House or Senate reports.

13

mentioned -­

14

It wasn't mentioned in

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It wasn't

Well, why wouldn't

15

-- wouldn't -- Patchak turned on this Court's

16

holding sovereign immunity had been waived.

17

And now Congress -- using the APA words, and

18

the APA itself doesn't say sovereign immunity,

19

so the APA withdrew the immunity, and this,

20

using the same kind of language, restores it.

21

Why isn't that the appropriate way to

22

look at this case?

What did Congress want it

23

to do?

They -- we said sovereign immunity is

24

waived.

They said sovereign immunity is not

25

waived.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

22

MR. GANT:

I take Congress at its word

2

in what it intended to do, and the D.C. Circuit

3

said the same, which is to void the case, to

4

make it go away, to direct dismissal against

5

Patchak and for Zinke.

That's what -- that's

6

what the statute says.

That's how the D.C.

7

Circuit, I think, properly understood it.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And -­

Well, I'm -- I'm

17

wondering if it helps your position to say that

18

the Congress is stripping him of certain rights

19

that he had because of the litigation.

20

MR. GANT:

Well, there -- there's no

21

question.

I mean, we'd have to go back on

22

remand in addressing the question of

23

entitlement to costs and others, the

24

entitlement to a declaratory judgment, the

25

meaning of 2(a).

JUSTICE BREYER:

When -- when you say

2(a) -­

3

MR. GANT:

Yeah.

4

JUSTICE BREYER: -- imagine that was

5

the only statute.

6

imagine, as well, that 2(a) is, in fact,

7

constitutional and Congress can say in 2017

8

that when we took this into federal trust

9

territory, Indian trust territory, that was

10

constitutional.

11

right.

I thought your claim -- and

That's what it does.

If that's constitutional to do that,
do you have any case left?

We do have a case.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I realize that, but

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

my question is:

Would your client have a

2

lawsuit?

3

Because I thought his basis was that the taking

4

of the land into trust was not lawful under a

5

particular act because that just referred to

6

tribes that were tribes in the '30s.

What would be the basis for it?

7

MR. GANT:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

Right?

Yeah.
Now, this act says we

don't give a -- we don't care about that; we

10

say that the government had the power to take

11

it into trust anyway.

12

take it into trust when it did.

13
14

And it had that power to

So, if that's the law, what is your
client suing about?

15

MR. GANT:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

MR. GANT:

18

All right?

Well -­
How can he win?

For purposes of your

question, I'm presupposing that that's the law.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. GANT:

Yeah.

But one thing that happened

21

here is we -- no court could make that

22

determination.

23
24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, but what's

your argument?
MR. GANT:

The argument -- the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

25
1

argument is that -- well, we would argue that

2

it's not retroactive.

3
4

We would argue -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

MR. GANT:

I -- I understand.

But I

6

-- I -- we haven't briefed this, but I submit

7

that there is an argument, a colorable

8

argument, to be made that ratification is in a

9

sense an endorsement -- if you look at -- on

10

page 2 of the -­

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So your

12

argument is that (a) applies only to taking

13

into trust after the passage of the act -- the

14

(a), after the passage of (a)?

15

MR. GANT:

Yes.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

In other words, it

17

doesn't ratify the prior taking into trust of

18

Indian land?

There

But I -- I thought the

Chief Justice's examples were instances in

which a hypothetical statute deprived the

violations of -- on constitutional -- alleged

18

constitutional violations, the same as the

19

question that Justice Ginsburg gave to you,

20

taking away jurisdiction over cases involving

prayer in the schools or jurisdiction over

22

equal protection violations, but this is a

23

statutory case.

24
25

MR. GANT:

It is, although it has -­

because there were -- the Court in Patchak I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

addressed standing and sovereign immunity,

2

which at least have constitutional dimensions,

3

but there's no doubt about the fact that the

underlying claims at issue in the pending

complaint that's still operative are statutory

6

in nature.

The only thing I think -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

So why don't you

bring your case in state court?

the state court doesn't have a -- I mean, yeah,

MR. GANT:

-­

5

I honestly don't know the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But I suppose

-­

6

MR. GANT:

-- I don't know the answer.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- I suppose

8

the question is, I mean, just as in a case of

9

-- the antibusing cases, there's a

10

constitutional violation that Congress is

11

trying to insulate from review, and that's the

12

separation-of-powers claim.

13

MR. GANT:

And I took your question to

14

be that these were -- not that these were

15

identical situations, this case and -- and the

16

situations that Mr. Chief Justice posited, but

17

that they were close cousins.

18

And to go back to a question to try

19

and more directly answer your question, Justice

20

Gorsuch -- and I want to do save a few moments

21

for rebuttal -- if a statute said we think

22

Smith should win and, therefore, we -- we

23

determine that the courts shall not have

24

jurisdiction, that can't -- the fact that it

25

says it's jurisdictional cannot possibly save

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
30
1

it from a separation-of-powers scrutiny and

2

analysis.

3
4

And this is substantially similar to
that situation.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So why -- why is it

6

substantially similar to that situation?

7

makes it sound like it's because it's about a

8

single case, but you said that that wasn't your

9

theory.

10

That

So what is your theory?
MR. GANT:

Right.

We could change it

11

to -- to 10 Smiths win or in every case of

12

Smith v. Jones.

13

fact that Congress is directing the outcome and

14

it's saying that you win not because we've

15

changed the law, and notwithstanding old law

16

because we know two things about the old law -­

17

It's not the number.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's the

But doesn't Congress

18

always do that when it strips the federal

19

courts of jurisdiction over a category of

20

cases?

21

MR. GANT:

No.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Because we have said

23

that that applies to pending suits.

So I guess

24

the question is:

25

every time we said that, we were wrong; that

Why aren't you saying that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
31
1

any time Congress changes the jurisdiction of

2

the federal court and then applies to pending

3

cases, that that's a separation-of-powers

4

issue?

5

MR. GANT:

Because Shore and the other

6

separation-of-powers cases of this Court

7

counsel that we should take a functional,

8

practical look at the particulars of the case.

9

And in this case, unlike these hypothetical

10

statutes, you have Congress clearly directing

11

the outcome of the case where, under old law,

12

this Court held that this case may proceed.

13

The House report at page 2 said, under existing

14

law, the -- putting the land into trust was

15

likely unlawful.

16
17
18

And the only thing that changed was
Congress said this case goes away, period.
JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean, it sounds like

19

this is just based on your -- your analysis of

20

Congress's intent.

21

MR. GANT:

No, I -- it's not.

based on the case whether Congress was

directing the outcome of particular cases or

was it functioning more in a legislative role.

few moments for rebuttal, but I -- but -­

Justice.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I was just following

5

up on Justice Alito's because you -- you say

perfectly fine, but we've said it a lot of

times.

We

And this may be an

18

example of what the Court has talked about in

19

other contexts where line-drawing can be hard.

20

Again, I'd step back and look at -- ask the

21

fundamental questions.

22

Is -- has the legislature overstepped

23

its bounds, traversed the boundary between the

24

legislative function and the judicial function

25

in deciding how cases should be determined?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
34
1

Congress is entitled to try and affect the

2

outcomes, but the process of how it does it

3

very much matters.

4

And this is about as an egregious

5

circumstance as I can imagine of Congress

6

actually dictating the outcome of a case by

7

saying you shall -- must dismiss without

8

changing the underlying law and leaving it to

9

the courts to apply in future circumstances.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL

15

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENTS

16
17
18

MS. O'CONNELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The United States took title to the

19

Bradley Property in 2009, but the tribe's

20

operations on that land have been subject to

21

great uncertainty ever since then nevertheless.

22

Part of that uncertainty stems from

23

this Court's decision in Patchak I, which

24

interpreted the laws enacted by Congress up to

25

that point and concluded that the Quiet Title

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

Act did not bar Petitioner's challenge to the

2

trust status of this land.

3

The Court acknowledged in Patchak I

4

that barring claims like Petitioner's is within

5

Congress's legislative power.

6

Lake Act, Congress did a couple of things.

7

eliminated any doubt about the trust status of

8

this land by ratifying and confirming the

9

Secretary's action in 2005.

10

Through the Gun
It

And Congress also eliminated federal

11

court jurisdiction over challenges to the trust

12

status of this property, thereby revoking the

13

waiver of sovereign immunity in the APA.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose that Patchak

15

had relied on his interpretation of the law and

16

had built a facility on a neighboring property

17

that was just completely inconsistent with a

18

casino, so that he's -- has some -- some

19

serious reliance interests.

20
21
22

Would -- would this case be any
different?
MS. O'CONNELL:

Well, there -- there

23

could be other constitutional concerns that may

24

be implicated by Congress -- by an act of

25

Congress that takes away vested property rights

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
36
1

or something like that, but they're -- they're

2

not Article III interests.

3

I don't think that it would violate

4

the separation of powers for Congress to enact

5

a law that -­

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, they're taking

7

away his expectations when he built on the

8

property.

9

MS. O'CONNELL:

10
11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, then maybe -­
In the hypothetical

case, hypothetical.

12

still pass this statute?

18

MS. O'CONNELL:

other limits imposed in the Constitution on

21

retroactive application of laws.

22

claim, then regardless of Section 2(b), the -­

25

to -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

Maybe he has -- this

2

might be his best argument, that this

3

ratification business is not, in certain

4

respects, retroactive.

5
6

Can he bring this case in state court
against the Secretary?

7

MS. O'CONNELL:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9
10

No.

The Secretary -­

No.

Okay.

The

answer is no.
MS. O'CONNELL:

Well, he could bring

11

it, but the Secretary would still have immunity

12

in state court as for the trial.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

Has immunity

14

in state court, so you can't bring it.

15

has, let's imagine, under state law a right to

16

the peaceful enjoyment of his property.

17

what he's worried about.

18

So he

That's

Now, this (b) means -- his best claim,

19

he thinks, is not a constitutional claim that

20

they've taken it away, but he sees that in the

21

background.

22

His best claim, he thinks, is to say

23

that this law is not retroactive, and that in

24

the 1930s this tribe did not get -- was not one

25

of the ones that that Act protected.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
38
1

That's his argument.

With (b), he

2

cannot bring his claim in a state court.

He

3

cannot bring his claim in federal court.

And

4

there's no other person anywhere who even is

5

dreaming of such a claim.

6

And, therefore, what (b), he says,

7

does, as I understand it, is whatever general

8

language they dress it up in, it is taking the

9

only case that is likely to be brought,

10

challenging the taking of this land into trust

11

and challenging this later statute as well as

12

being interpreted, you know, such and such, and

13

throwing it out of court.

14

So there we have, though they have

15

excellent language and have tried to make it

16

general, in reality an act of Congress that

17

does nothing other than take his case and throw

18

it out of court.

19

Congress, the legislative branch, to enter into

20

the judicial process and say:

21

in this case you lose.

And that, he says, is for the

Mr. Plaintiff,

22

Now, what is your answer to that?

23

MS. O'CONNELL:

I've got a couple of

24

answers to -- specifically to the second part.

25

On the first part, I don't know if in this case

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
39
1

you're talking about some sort of a

2

hypothetical relief that he's asking for.

3

Regardless of whether this is a -- a statute

4

that's retroactive or not in terms of taking

5

the land into trust -­

6
7

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's not retroactive.

That's why I asked him the question.

8

MS. O'CONNELL:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

He -- he's -­
I take -- I take his

10

answer to my question was he retains certain

11

arguments that (a) is not sufficient to deprive

12

him of the right to use his property because

13

(a) does not move this tribe's land into trust

14

as of -- prior to its enactment.

15

MS. O'CONNELL:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

His -­
I think it's

something like that.

18

MS. O'CONNELL:

The -- just to

19

clarify, the -- he's filed an APA claim.

20

the relief he is asking for is prospective

21

injunctive relief.

22

actually matter if the statute is retroactive

23

or not.

24
25

So

There doesn't -- it doesn't

But to answer the question about
whether the Congress is targeting one

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
40
1

particular lawsuit in this case, a couple of

2

responses:

3

although that seems to the Petitioner, and it

4

may be the practical effect, that because his

5

is the only case that's pending, it's the only

6

question about the -- the APA?

that has been raised on the other side is it

JUSTICE ALITO:

there wouldn't be any challenge to that.

7

Well, the literal -­

And it's not clear how they get to

And I guess I just don't

11

understand how -- well, you're saying it's an

12

open issue how broad Congress's determination

13

that these cases shouldn't be in federal court

14

is?

15

MS. O'CONNELL:

That's -- it's -- it's

16

an open issue how broad 2(a) is.

17

any action -- well, yes, that any action

argument that we -- we presented to the court

but -­

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

Can you point to any

21

case in which we've held there was sovereign

immunity where the statute said nothing -­

25

MS. O'CONNELL:

Well, I -- again, I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
52

think that in this context it doesn't matter if

2

the statute is broader than just precluding

claims against the United States because under

the APA, what you're looking for in order to

say that the APA doesn't apply is a statute

that precludes judicial review.

So what does

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MS. O'CONNELL:

least means that you can't -- that nobody can

status of the land and the Secretary's decision

6

to take the land into trust.

JUSTICE BREYER:

So I think -­

Here in the trust -­

8

I'm on my own track here, but I -- I know this

question is fascinating, what we've been

11

I'm still stuck on (a) and why we really have

13
14

You said that all they've asked for is
prospective relief.

15

MS. O'CONNELL:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Correct.
And as far as

17

prospective relief, when this was passed in

18

2014, it certainly, in (a), took the Indian

19

land into trust.

20

MS. O'CONNELL:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
All right.

That's

22

what they're challenging, prospectively.

23

What's the argument?

MS. O'CONNELL:

the most fascinating and difficult questions in

course federal courts call "darkness at noon,"

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Under (a) -- under

16

MS. O'CONNELL:

If Congress is taking

17

away jurisdiction, then, no, I don't think the

18

court would have the authority to order costs.

19

And he also wouldn't be a prevailing party if

20

no judgment had been entered.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I'm -- I'm

22

assuming -- I'm assuming that he would have

23

been a prevailing party, there was a

24

substantial chance of it, and he would have

25

been entitled to costs.

But even though

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
56
1

80 percent of the costs had been expended, he

2

-- the Congress could suddenly say he can't get

3

them?

4

MS. O'CONNELL:

The -- the rule that

5

this Court has laid out is that once a final

6

judgment has been entered, that Congress can't

7

undo that.

8
9

And so I -- any time up to -- I mean,
the Court's cases have said again and again

10

that the Congress can enact jurisdictional

11

rules and apply them to pending cases, so, no,

12

I don't think there is any separation-of-powers

13

problem with such a -- with such a rule.

14

One other final point I'd like to

15

make, the -- the Petitioner argues that by

16

enacting Section 2(b), that Congress is taking

17

away the Court's ability to interpret the law,

18

but when it's a jurisdictional statute that

19

Congress is enacting, a jurisdiction-stripping

20

statute, there's not going to be much left for

21

the Court to do.

22

There's cases from this Court that

23

talk about whether there is something left for

24

the Court to do and whether that's enough to -­

25

to give the Court a role in -- in exercising

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
57
1

its judicial role.

Those cases are all trying

2

to decide whether Congress has changed the law

3

such that the case is taken outside the scope

4

of Klein.

5

When you have a statute like this one

6

that takes away subject matter jurisdiction of

7

the federal courts and gets a category of cases

8

off of the judicial agenda, the Court just has

9

to determine whether this case falls within

10

that category and then it -- it should dismiss.

12

If there are no further questions, we
ask that the Court affirm.

19
20

Thank you,

MR. SHAH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

21

I guess I'd like to start with Justice

22

Alito's question because I think it cuts to the

23

matter.

24

a separation of powers case?

25

What would be an administrable line in

And the line that we would embrace is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
58
1

the line that the other side has offered in the

2

Federal Court Scholars amicus brief supporting

3

the other side, and this is at page 15 of that

4

amicus brief.

5

on Professor Hart, it says, "It is one thing to

6

exclude completely the federal courts from

7

adjudication; it is quite another to vest the

8

federal courts with jurisdiction to adjudicate

9

but simultaneously restrict the power of those

10

courts to perform the adjudicatory function in

11

the manner they deem appropriate."

12

It says -- and this is relying

Now, the scholars then explain why

13

that first category, which this case clearly

14

falls within when you're taking federal courts

15

out of the business, entirely raises no

16

separation-of-powers problems.

17

They say, "by wholly excluding the

18

federal court, Congress loses its ability to

19

draw upon the integrity possessed by the

20

Article III judiciary in the public's eyes."

21

And so we think that gets to the core

22

separation-of-powers concerns that are

23

underlying the lines that this Court has drawn.

24

It avoids any puppeteering concern that

25

Congress is using the Article III, the judicial

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

imprimatur to give a merits judgment.

2

avoids any public misperception concern that

this is an Article III resolution on the merits

mean, doesn't this just exclude the power of

9

the federal courts?

10

MR. SHAH:

Yes.

I

And so that -- that's

11

the permissible side of the line, that the

12

professors lay out.

13

excluding completely the federal courts from

14

adjudication, that does not raise a

15

separation-of-powers problem.

They rely on Professor

Hart's dialectic for that proposition.

19

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

21

MR. SHAH:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

They

Got it.

-- are like -- oh, sorry.
Could I ask you to -­

23

Ms. O'Connell said when you were looking at

24

that -- if you had a piece of legislation that

25

said in Jones v. Smith, Smith loses, that that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
60
1

would be unconstitutional.

2

MR. SHAH:

Right.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

4

that because nine of us said it.

5

MR. SHAH:

6

(Laughter.)

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

8

And she has to say

Yes.

So then the question

is why is it different -­

9

MR. SHAH:

10

Sure.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- if Congress instead

11

says in Jones v. Smith, there shall be no

12

jurisdiction, and Smith loses.

13

that different?

14

MR. SHAH:

Why -- why is

So, Your Honor, if, in

15

fact, what they're doing is taking away

16

jurisdiction, they just say there is no -- so

17

in your hypothetical, there is no -­

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

19

there shall be no jurisdiction -­

20

MR. SHAH:

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

22
23

In Jones v. Smith,

Right.
-- and ergo, Smith

loses.
MR. SHAH:

Right.

Well, the reason

24

why we think that statute is different is

25

because of the first part of it.

It's saying

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
61
1
2

there is no jurisdiction.
So, when -- when it says Smith loses,

3

it's not in the same way that was in the

4

hypothetical in Bank Markazi where all nine

5

Justices said that that would be problematic.

6

And three reasons why it's different.

7

First, in the Bank Markazi hypothetical of

8

Smith wins in a civil suit between Smith and

9

Jones, that is a merits judgment that the Court

10

had in mind.

11

is a merits judgment that the Court -­

12

Presumably, in Smith wins, there

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose -- suppose

13

the statute said, in order to ensure that Smith

14

wins, there shall be no jurisdiction.

15

MR. SHAH:

Well, again, Your Honor, I

16

guess I still -- if what it's doing is -- is

17

asking the Court or taking away the -­

18
19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

it's doing is clear to everybody.

20

MR. SHAH:

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

22
23

It's doing -- what

that it's clear.

It's taking away -­
In fact, it says

What's the result?

MR. SHAH:

Sure.

So I still think

24

that is distinguishable from the hypothetical

25

statute in Bank Markazi.

And the reason is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
62
1

because of the -- because it's taking away

2

jurisdiction.

3

reasons why it's different.

4

So the -- there are a couple

One is a functional matter.

5

judgment is quite different.

6

judgment.

7

Markazi hypothetical.

8
9

It's not a merits

Smith is presumably not in the Bank

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you're taking

away jurisdiction -­

10

MR. SHAH:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

a particular result in litigation.

13

The

MR. SHAH:

Yes.
-- in order to have

Right, Your Honor, but the

14

result that you're getting is different than in

15

Smith v. wins -- Smith wins, because -­

16
17
18

JUSTICE KAGAN:
much cares.

I don't think Smith

Why would Smith care?

MR. SHAH:

Well, Your Honor, in -- in

19

Bank Markazi, Smith was the plaintiff.

20

cares a lot, because if he wins, he gets an

21

award of relief, and that relief has res

22

judicata effect.

23

He

That's very different from a dismissal

24

for lack of jurisdiction in which there's no

25

merits judgment, there's no award of relief,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1
2

and there's no res judicata effect.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It doesn't say

3

anything about jurisdiction.

4

enlisting the courts.

5

you have to -- you take this stamp and you

6

stamp dismissed on it.

7

And you are

You're telling the court

And it doesn't say dismissed for want

8

of jurisdiction.

9

out what the collateral consequences are, since

10

I suppose we'd have to figure

the statute doesn't say.

11

MR. SHAH:

Well, your -­

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You aren't

13

dragooning the court into doing something the

14

court doesn't want to do.

15

dismiss a case that's pending before them.

16

MR. SHAH:

You're making them

Well, Your Honor, it -­

17

we're assuming -- if we're assuming this is a

18

jurisdiction-stripping statute; that is, it is

19

withdrawing jurisdiction, then the only thing

20

the court can do is dismiss for lack of

21

jurisdiction.

22

And if that, enlisting the courts in

23

that limited matter is a problem, then that's

24

true for 150 years of this Court's precedent.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64
1

begs the answer -- that begs the answer to the

2

-- the -- the Hart and Wechsler dialogue that

3

when the court -- when Congress strips

4

jurisdiction to achieve an otherwise

5

unconstitutional result, that that's perfectly

6

fine.

7

MR. SHAH:

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9
10

Well, Your Honor -­
And I think

that's a very difficult question.
MR. SHAH:

Well, Your Honor, I think

11

that question implicates different interests.

12

It's not a separation-of-powers problem, I

13

don't think, for Congress to say a certain set

14

of cases can't be within the federal courts.

15

If they're talking about equal

16

protection cases and singling those out, that

17

runs afoul of the equal protection clause.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, is it -­

19

I understand your answer, but is it a

20

separation-of-powers question if they say, if

21

the claim is separation of powers, the case -­

22

there -- there is no jurisdiction?

23

MR. SHAH:

Yes, Your Honor, there -­

24

there I grant you we're not arguing that

25

Congress can take away the court's jurisdiction

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
65
1

to adjudicate whether there is a

2

separation-of-powers problem itself, the

3

constitutional vow itself, and that's why we're

4

here, on here.

5

We are not arguing that Congress has

6

done or could -- could do that.

7

prevent the court from adjudicating whether the

8

statute it has passed is constitutional, but

9

that's not what's going on here, we're having a

10

full airing of the claim.

11

The question is:

It can't

Can they withdraw

12

jurisdiction?

13

courts, as you say, in that limited manner

14

violates separation of powers, well, that's

15

true in the seminal withdrawal of jurisdiction

16

case in McCardle and 150 years of cases after

17

that.

18

made -­

19

And if, in fact, enlisting the

In fact, in McCardle, the Petitioner

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the

20

answer to McCardle is it was just a question of

21

how you get habeas.

22

Congress had closed off one route, but it left

23

open another.

24
25

MR. SHAH:

There was another route.

Well, Your -- Your Honor, I

guess a couple responses.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
66
1

One is the Petitioner in McCardle

2

actually made the very same argument that

3

Petitioner makes here, is that Congress was

4

targeting my suit when it passed that statute.

5

And the Court expressly addressed that argument

6

and said, no, we're not going to look behind

7

Congress's act.

8

It describes a category of suits.

9

we're not going to ask whether Congress had

10

some illicit motive of targeting your suit.

11

That's my first response, Justice Ginsburg.

12

And

The second response is if, in fact,

13

there's a claim that there is no other forum to

14

bring this case, then maybe there is, as -- as

15

this Court said in Bank Markazi, there are

16

other constitutional limitations.

17

a due process problem.

18

Maybe that's

In fact, Petitioner raised a due

19

process claim in the lower courts.

20

cert petition, this Court denied cert on the

21

due process claim.

22

And in its

So that is out of the case.

We're strictly on separation-of-powers

23

grounds, and there is no separation-of-powers

24

problem in this Court withdrawing jurisdiction,

25

including with respect to pending cases.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
67
1

That's what it did in McCardle.

2

did in Assessors v. Osborne.

3

did in Hallowell.

4

That's what it

That's what it

That's what -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess I'm -- I'm not

5

quite sure what you're reserving there, Mr.

6

Shah, so here is a hypothetical.

7

MR. SHAH:

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

Okay.
There's a very large

corporation, commits a lot of employment

10

discrimination.

11

of employment discrimination suits filed

12

against it.

13

Because it does, it has a lot

And so the CEO of this big corporation

14

goes to Congress and says:

These suits are

15

getting to be a real hassle, and so I'd like a

16

piece of legislation.

17

enough, and it says there shall be no

18

jurisdiction over any employment discrimination

19

suits filed against that corporation.

And Congress says:

20

MR. SHAH:

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Good

Right.
All right?

And -- and

22

-- and -- and -- and -- and in so doing, it

23

knocks out all these employment litigation -­

24

all these employment discrimination suits that

25

have been filed against that corporation.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
68
1

Is that constitutional?

2

MR. SHAH:

It may be unconstitutional,

3

but not for failure of separation of powers,

4

not a separation-of-powers violation.

5

that is the type of class-of-one problem that

6

this Court noted in -- in the Court's opinion

7

in Bank Markazi.

8
9

In Footnote 27, it said:

Maybe

Look, if

you're singling out a particular litigant for

10

special disfavored or favored treatment, that's

11

the class -- maybe that's a class-of-one claim.

12

So it's not a separation -­

13
14
15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, if this had said

just David Patchak's suit, different case?
MR. SHAH:

Well, Your Honor, if

16

Congress had singled out just Mr. Patchak's

17

suit in the text of the statute, maybe they

18

could have brought that sort of claim.

19

think based on this Court's decision in Bank

20

Markazi that talked about Congress is free to

21

legislate with -- in a particularized manner

22

even with respect to particular cases, it's

23

probably okay, but it would raise at least a

24

harder question.

25

statute here is about a class of cases.

I still

But make no mistake, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Now, I will grant you it is a

2

relatively narrow class of cases, suits that

3

were relating to the Bradley Property.

4

it turned out -­

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And as

I -- I don't know

6

why the hypothetical that Justice Kagan just

7

put doesn't severely compromise the integrity

8

of the courts.

9

against one class or -- or against a large

10

class of defendants but not another class.

The courts are hearing cases

11

And this, it seems to me, severely -­

MR. SHAH:

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- calls into

14

question the integrity of the courts.

15

that's a separation-of-powers problem.

16

MR. SHAH:

And

Well, Your Honor, I agree

17

with you, everything up until that last part.

18

I agree if -- if the court was drawing lines

19

that you could only sue these type of

20

defendants and not other types of defendants or

21

singling out one company -­

separation of powers is not involved.

And you said

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It seems to me that

this is intrinsically separation of powers.

7

MR. SHAH:

Well, Your Honor, I think

8

that's an equal protection problem.

9

as this Court recognized in Footnote 27, there

10

are claims to deal with that.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You can take

12

an extra minute because we're going to give

13

your friend some rebuttal time.

14

MR. SHAH:

Sure, Your Honor.

15

I guess what I was starting to finish

16

up on was on the -- on the class of claims, it

17

may be a narrow category, but just because it

18

turned out that the only suit happened to be

19

Patchak's, it would be an odd constitutional

20

rule if on the day before they -- if they've

21

passed the statute on the day before Patchak's

suit, it's fine.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19

MR. GANT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

20

Justice.

21

through them quickly.

22

Thank you,

A few quick points.

I'll try and run

Justice Kennedy, I completely agree

23

with you that there is a separation of powers

24

problem posed by the circumstance -- the

25

hypotheticals that were posed.

We shouldn't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
72
1

lose sight of the fact that separation of

2

powers were designed in substantial part to

3

protect an individual's rights and to protect

4

an independent judiciary.

5

What we would have here is, if you

6

affirm and uphold the Gun Lake Act, you will

7

have judges looking over their shoulders

8

wondering if they're going to be next in a case

9

like this Court was in Patchak I, where

10

Congress says we don't like the results.

11

going to take the case away from the courts.

12

We can dress it up using the language of

13

jurisdiction, but it's still taking the case

14

away from the courts and directing the outcome.

15

We're

Now, on the point, the distinction

16

that counsel for the Respondents were trying to

17

drive home, that somehow a direction to dismiss

18

in 2(b) is different because it's not merits.

19

I would refer to the Court to a unanimous

20

decision from last year, CRST versus EEOC,

21

where the Court found the -- the party that was

22

not prevailing in -- that -- that did not win

23

on the merits in the EEOC case was nevertheless

24

the prevailing party.

25

The Court, unanimous Court observed

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
73
1

the defendant, however, has fulfilled its

2

primary objective whenever plaintiff's

3

challenge is rebuffed, irrespective of the

4

precise reason.

5

As anyone who has ever been a

6

plaintiff or represented a plaintiff knows,

7

when the plaintiff's case is dismissed, the

8

plaintiff has lost and the defendant has won.

9

It could have different collateral

10

consequences, res judicata and so on, but

11

fundamentally, when the plaintiff gets kicked

12

out of court, they have lost.

13
14
15

Mr. Patchak had that result as -- from
2(b).
With respect to the relationship

16

between 2(a) and 2(b), 2(a) does one of two

17

things here.

18

all the work is done by 2(b).

19

relates to the Gun Lake -- to the Bradley

20

Property, it shall be dismissed.

21

It's either meaningless because
If the suit

Or, as the House of Representatives

22

argued on pages 3 and 20 of its brief, what

23

2(a) -- 2(b) does is it implements 2(a).

24

was an extraordinary assertion by the House of

25

Representatives, which came and filed an amicus

Heritage Reporting Corporation

This

Official
74
1

brief, and they said what they were really

2

telling you is that what the Congress did in

3

2(b) was it decided what 2(a) means and then

4

kicked the case out of court based on its own

5

understanding while depriving this Court or any

6

other court of the opportunity to say what 2(a)

7

means.

8
9

Respondents -- Federal Respondents
said they didn't know quite what some of the

10

provisions in the Gun Lake Act means except

11

they do know that it prevents Mr. Patchak's

12

case from going forward.

13

This seems to me that their uncertain

14

about the meaning, except when it comes to its

15

application to Mr. Patchak, only highlights the

16

fact that Congress was trying to direct the

17

outcome in Mr. Patchak's case.

18

With respect to the hypotheticals that

19

were posed to Mr. Shah by Justices Kagan and

20

Kennedy, this case is no different, I think,

21

than the hypotheticals you were posing.

22

is substantially like Smith wins.

23

around with the words.

24

Smith to win; therefore, there's no

And finally, Justice Gorsuch, with

5

respect to the Gonzalez case that you were

6

discussing with counsel for the Federal

7

Respondents, in that case, both of the parties
