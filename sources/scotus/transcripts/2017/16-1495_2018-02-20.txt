CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

5

Mr. Heytens.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TOBY J. HEYTENS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. HEYTENS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

The decision below should be reversed

12

for two independent reasons.

13

Because the only setting in which a person can

14

be made to be a witness against himself for

15

purposes of the Fifth Amendment is during a

16

proceeding where that person's guilt or

17

punishment are to be adjudicated, that is, at

18

trial.

19

Reason number 1:

And, second, because regardless of

20

whether it is possible that some types of Fifth

21

Amendment violations could ever occur before

22

trial, the Court should reject any such notion

23

with regard to the specific type of Fifth

24

Amendment violation alleged here, which is the

25

use of statements in violation of Garrity

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
4
1

versus New Jersey.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Mr. Heytens -­
Your -- your first

4

statement, I -- was very well stated.

5

first reason is because the only thing that

6

double jeopardy -- that the clause applies to

7

is?

8
9

MR. HEYTENS:

The

That the

Self-Incrimination Clause can only be violated

10

during a proceeding where the person whose

11

statements are at issue is being used to

12

adjudicate that person's guilt or punishment

13

for purposes of criminal liability.

14

first reason.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's the

It has to be at

16

trial.

So, in making that argument, Mr.

17

Heytens, you are recognizing that you are

18

shrinking to almost a vanishing point the

19

possibility of using the Fifth Amendment to

20

block the use against you of incriminating -­

21

the -- you -- you're shrinking the privilege to

22

nothing because there aren't many trials

23

nowadays; upwards of 95 percent of cases are

24

disposed of by plea bargaining.

25

limiting the Fifth Amendment to there must be a

So, by

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
5
1

trial, there must be a witness at trial, you're

2

saying effectively the Fifth Amendment, which

3

is considered very important, is out of the

4

picture in most criminal cases.

5

MR. HEYTENS:

I don't think that's -­

6

that's right, Justice Ginsburg, and I think the

7

reason for that is that it's critical to

8

distinguish between two issues.

9

The first issue is when can the

10

privilege against self-incrimination be

11

invoked, and the second is when the

12

Self-Incrimination Clause can actually be -­

13

can actually be violated.

14

So let me give you an example.

Under

15

this Court's decision in Chavez, if Chavez

16

holds nothing else, I understand Chavez to hold

17

this:

18

interrogation room can itself constitute a

19

completed violation of the Fifth Amendment.

20

But that is not to say, of course,

Nothing that happens inside a police

21

that if an officer is interrogating me I cannot

22

say I decline to answer your questions on the

23

grounds that may incriminate me.

24

it's very important to distinguish between the

25

question of when the privilege can be asserted

So I think

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
6
1

-- I can assert the privilege in a civil case.

2

I can assert the privilege in a police

3

interrogation room.

4

at someone else's criminal trial, and nothing

5

that we're asking the Court to do is

6

inconsistent with any of that.

7

I can assert the privilege

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, Mr. Heytens,

8

then if this -- this defendant, based on what

9

you just said, could refuse to answer the

10

question if it had been put to him at the

11

probable cause hearing, say tell us about that

12

episode when you -- you retained the knife, he

13

could say:

14

incriminate me, he could raise the privilege.

I won't because that might

15

MR. HEYTENS:

Absolutely.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But he can't object

17

if prior testimony, a -- a prior statement to

18

that effect, is introduced at the probable

19

cause hearing.

20

can't be introduced.

21

testimony, if he gives the statement at the

22

probable cause hearing, that's right, he

23

doesn't have to incriminate himself, but he

24

can't object to the introduce -- introduction

25

of a prior compelled statement.

He -- he said it before, it
If he gives the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

MR. HEYTENS:

I -- I understand the -­

2

the apparent anomaly, Justice Ginsburg.

3

think the reason, though, for it is the reason

4

that he can assert the privilege against

5

self-incrimination at the probable cause

6

hearing is the same reason that he could assert

7

it in the police interrogation room.

8

risk that if he gives a statement in that

9

setting, it could later be used against him at

10

a trial on guilt or a trial on the merits, and

11

that's the reason that he could assert the

12

privilege at the probable cause hearing, but it

13

is not because that anything that happens at

14

the probable cause hearing can actually make

15

him a witness against himself.

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I

It is the

What about a grand

jury proceeding?
MR. HEYTENS:

Can it be asserted?

Absolutely, Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER:

No, can it be

prevented?
MR. HEYTENS:

Our -- Justice Breyer,

our understanding -- the -- can what -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, I -- I've

come across Supreme Court cases which refer to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
8
1

a grand jury proceeding as part of a criminal

2

case, and you cannot introduce it in a criminal

3

case.

4

So what I wondered and seemed to be

5

missing is that I haven't found anything that

6

says, you know, you can't attack the grand jury

7

proceeding later, but that's different.

8

MR. HEYTENS:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

So -­

So -­
-- so somebody finds

10

a way, gets an order from a judge, he says I

11

don't want these pieces of paper introduced,

12

they were taken from me in violation of my

13

Fifth Amendment right not to be a witness, and

14

I don't want them brought before the grand

15

jury.

16
17

I'm rather surprised that that's never
come up.

18

MR. HEYTENS:

19

Breyer, I think it has come up.

20

that points -­

21

Well -- well, Justice

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I think

And -- then where are

22

the cases that say that even though the person

23

objected, you can introduce it to the grand

24

jury?

25

cases that say a grand jury is a criminal

I can't find any.

And I have found

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
9
1
2

proceeding.
MR. HEYTENS:

Right.

We -- we

3

certainly understand the grand -- this Court's

4

decision in Counselman to say that the grand

5

jury is part of the criminal case for purposes

6

of the Fifth Amendment.

7

very significant because, Justice Breyer, I

8

agree that I'm not aware of any case where the

9

defendant tries to stop the information from

10
11

And we think that's

being presented to the grand jury.
What I am aware of is numerous

12

statements by this Court that says that a

13

defendant may not attack an indictment by

14

claiming that the grand jury considered

15

statements obtained in violation of the Fifth

16

Amendment.

17

that at least three times.

18

By my count, the Court has said

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Heytens, you also

19

agree now, don't you, that the probable cause

20

hearing is part of the criminal case?

21

not at issue here?

That's

22

MR. HEYTENS:

We agree with that, yes.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

24

just look at the language of the

25

Self-Incrimination Clause, it's "shall be

Okay.

So then, if I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

compelled in any criminal case," which we are

2

in now, and -- and there's no issue here about

3

compulsion.

4

isn't.

5

Maybe there should be, but there

"Shall be compelled in any criminal

6

case to be a witness against himself."

"To be

7

a witness against himself," if I'm just

8

thinking about the natural reading of those

9

terms, it's when my testimony is introduced

10

adverse to my interests in that criminal case.

11

So why isn't that just what we should

12
13

be asking?
MR. HEYTENS:

I understand that if you

14

were looking simply at the language, that is a

15

more than plausible interpretation, but I don't

16

think that's the -­

17
18
19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Kind of the obvious

interpretation, right?
MR. HEYTENS:

Right.

But -- but I

20

think it would be inconsistent with a number of

21

things that this Court has already said, and I

22

think it would be inconsistent with some of the

23

concessions that I understand our friend on the

24

other side to have made.

25

Let me give you one very -- very clear

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
11
1

example.

2

pretty clearly part of a criminal case, and I

3

understand the red brief to all but acknowledge

4

that the rule that they're advocating doesn't

5

apply to Gerstein hearing.

6

I think a Gerstein hearing is also

This Court in Estelle -- I think a

7

competency hearing is clearly part of a

8

criminal case, but this Court said in Estelle

9

that -­

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I don't think

11

Estelle is -- is inconsistent with that because

12

what the Court in Estelle said was that this is

13

actually a neutral determination.

14

understandable when you consider that the

15

victory you win when you're declared

16

incompetent is to continue to be detained as

17

incompetent.

18

And that's

So it's -- it's -- it's not like here

19

where it's like:

20

I want to win this so that I can get out of

21

this criminal case.

22

Well, obviously -- obviously,

MR. HEYTENS:

Sure.

Well, I guess two

23

responses to that, Justice Kagan.

I think

24

everything you just said also would apply to a

25

grand jury context, and the Court has

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1

repeatedly said you can't attack an indictment.

2

So -­

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

I mean, you're

4

quite right that there's a -- if you are right

5

that the grand jury is different, and you might

6

be, that there is a kind of anomaly there, but

7

explained, I think, by a kind of historic

8

judgment that grand juries are sacrosanct, that

9

everything has to be secret, that we don't want

10

people poking around in that black box, and

11

none of that is true of just standard probable

12

cause hearings.

13

MR. HEYTENS:

We agree with that,

14

Justice Kagan, but I think the anomaly actually

15

goes deeper than that for -- for two reasons.

16

One is that, under Kansas law -- under Kansas

17

law, this probable cause hearing is an express

18

statutory substitute for proceeding by a grand

19

jury.

20

And so we think it would be a little

21

bit strange to say that you have rights at the

22

substitute proceeding that you only have by

23

virtue of state law but -­

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
how is it the same?

I'm sorry, how -­

You -- it's not the same.

In a grand jury, there's no adversarial

4

the grand jury.

5

imperfect substitute at best.

6

There's no judge.

There's no

There's no anything like

So it can't be -- it's an

MR. HEYTENS:

Well, I -- I agree that

7

the procedures aren't the same, certainly,

8

Justice Sotomayor.

9

procedures are different.

And I understand the
I'm not sure what

10

any of that, though, has to do with whether

11

this is a criminal case and whether I'm being

12

made to be a witness against myself for

13

purposes of the Self-Incrimination Clause.

14

But I think there's an even bigger

15

problem, which is the anomaly is actually not a

16

two-part anomaly; it's a three-part anomaly

17

because, as I read this Court's decisions in

18

Hurtado and Gerstein, the State of Kansas could

19

choose option number 3, option number 3 being

20

no grand jury, no probable cause hearing, the

21

prosecution goes forward based on nothing but

22

the prosecutor's determination that there is

23

probable cause.

24

that it would violate the Self-Incrimination

25

Clause for the prosecutor sitting in her office

And there is no suggestion

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1
2

to consider these statements.
So we're in a situation here where, as

3

far as the federal Constitution is concerned,

4

Kansas has three choices:

5

probable cause hearing, or neither.

6

appears clear to me that, in option 1 and

7

option 3, the right that our friends on the

8

other side are asserting would not apply.

9

so it would seem anomalous that you'd have

a grand jury, a
And it

10

rights in option 2 that you don't have in

11

option 1 or option 3.

12

And

But -- but even if the grand jury

13

analogy isn't persuasive to all members of the

14

Court, I think there's another analogy that is

15

extremely damaging, which is the Gerstein

16

analogy because, as I read this Court's

17

decision in Gerstein, the legal question that

18

is decided at a Gerstein hearing, whether there

19

is probable cause to believe that the accused

20

has committed the crime, is legally

21

indistinguishable from the question at Kansas's

22

probable cause hearing.

23

So I'm not sure what the basis on that

24

ground would be for saying that this right

25

applies at the probable cause hearing but

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

doesn't apply at the Gerstein hearing.

2

don't think it's plausible to say that it

3

applies at the Gerstein hearing for all the

4

reasons that the Kansas amicus brief gives,

5

because it's simply not going to be practically

6

possible to have this right at a Gerstein

7

hearing, which is a non-adversarial proceeding

8

where there is no right to counsel and which

9

has to be held within 48 hours of arrest and

11

detention.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I don't -- so

12

back to my first question, I don't know what

13

the answer is in a grand jury proceeding.

14

know you can't attack that proceeding at trial,

15

but I don't know whether, as in this case,

16

somebody might, if they were used, bring a 1983

17

claim on the ground that its constitutional

18

rights have been violated.

19

happened here.

I do

That's what

20

And I don't know what would happen if

21

because of the circumstance the defendant went

22

before a judge and said:

23

piece of paper out of the grand jury

24

proceeding.

25

MR. HEYTENS:

Judge, keep that

Justice Breyer -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE BREYER:

So I do think perhaps

2

they should be treated alike, but I don't know

3

what alike is.

4

MR. HEYTENS:

Well -- well, Justice

5

Breyer, I think all the reasons that the Court

6

has said that you can't collaterally attack an

7

indictment would also argue in saying that you

8

can't file a 1983 action.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

MR. HEYTENS:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why?

Well, because -­
I don't know.

12

you could.

know where to go to look that up.

18

And -- is -- the reasons this Court gave in its

19

most recent decision on the grand -- the

collateral attack on the grand jury, the Court

21

said:

2
3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah, all right.

I

see that.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Who would -­

So -- so we have an

6

instance where there is a committee

7

investigating Mr. Smith and Mr. Smith takes the

8

Fifth Amendment 90 -- 94 times and then they

9

compel him to give all kinds of statements and

10

then there's a grand jury and he goes to the

11

judge and says:

12

out.

Judge, keep those statements

13

MR. HEYTENS:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MR. HEYTENS:

16

I -­

-- I understand why

Mr. Smith might want to do that.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

MR. HEYTENS:

19

Yeah.

But I -- but I guess

just -­

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

that.

22

my Fifth Amendment right.

And I understand

He says they were taken in violation of

23

MR. HEYTENS:

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

And Mr. -­

Keep them out.

And -­

So -­
And there we are.

Keep them out of the grand

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
18
1

jury.

2

so this is an important case in more ways than

3

one because what we decide here, I guess, would

4

decide the same thing for the grand jury.

5

Huh.

And you're telling me there is -­

MR. HEYTENS:

Well -- well, Justice

6

Breyer, I -- I'd say two things on that.

First

7

and foremost, if he believed that his

8

statements were used in that way, I think it's

9

useful to take a step back and realize nothing

10

that we are saying is to suggest that

11

Mr. Smith, in Justice Breyer's example, would

12

not be file -- entitled to file a motion to

13

suppress each and every one of those statements

14

at his criminal trial.

15

And if that motion prevailed, he would

16

very likely get a dismissal on the charges

17

because, if it was actually true that the

18

government's evidence was almost all derived

19

from his own compelled statements, the granting

20

of the motion to suppress before trial would

21

effectively end the criminal proceeding in his

22

favor.

23

So it's not as if we're -- and the

24

same thing is true here.

If Officer Vogt was

25

correct that the -- that the statements that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
19
1

were used were obtained and then used in

2

violation of Garrity -- were obtained in

3

violation of Garrity, and if this case had

4

gotten past the probable cause hearing, I

5

assume and expect that Officer Vogt's lawyer

6

would have filed a motion to suppress all of

7

those statements at trial.

8
9

And if his Garrity claim was
meritorious, I think we need to assume that

10

that motion would have been granted.

11

that motion is granted and if all of the

12

evidence was, in fact -- or much of the

13

evidence was derived from those statements, I

14

assume that the criminal proceeding would have

15

ended in his favor.

16

defendants in a position where they don't have

17

an opportunity.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR

4

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS

5

AMICUS CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF THE

6
7
8
9

PETITIONER
MS. PRELOGAR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The Self-Incrimination Clause

10

prohibits using a defendant's compelled

11

statement to adjudicate his criminal

12

responsibility.

13

incriminatory use does not occur in a pretrial

14

probable cause hearing where the defendant's

15

guilt and punishment are not on the line and

16

the only question is whether he'll be bound

17

over to the next stage of the criminal case.

That kind of prohibited

18

I'd like to begin -­

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. -- Ms. Prelogar, I

20

-- I guess that would mean as a conceptual

21

matter, even if not as a practical matter, but

22

as a conceptual matter, that the government

23

could force somebody to testify against himself

24

in such a proceeding?

25

MS. PRELOGAR:

Well, to be clear,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
23
1

Justice Kagan, we think that a defendant in

2

that situation would still -- would still have

3

a valid privilege against self-incrimination

4

because he could reasonably fear that anything

5

he says in that probable cause hearing could

6

then be used against him at the ensuing trial

7

to prove his guilt.

8
9

So a defendant could invoke his
privilege to prevent that testimony.

And at

10

that point, the only way the government could

11

compel the defendant to speak would be to

12

formally grant him immunity.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yeah.

So this is why

14

I said maybe not as a practical matter, but as

15

a conceptual matter, you would be saying that

16

the government could, if it chose and if it

17

accepted certain consequences, could force him

18

to testify against himself?

19
20

MS. PRELOGAR:

Only by granting that

immunity and -­

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

22

MS. PRELOGAR:

Right.
-- as this Court has

23

recognized in the immunity cases, by then

24

conveying on the defendant and conferring on

25

him that -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
24
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

How about this?

How

2

about if he didn't testify?

3

government draw an inference against him for

4

failing to testify, as the government could,

5

for example, in a civil case?

6

MS. PRELOGAR:

Could -- could the

I think that the

7

government could draw the adverse inference,

8

but I think the inference would only matter if

9

the government had already come forward with

10

sufficient evidence to show that you would

11

expect the defendant to respond to that and to

12

speak at that hearing.

13

think the government has already proven

14

probable cause.

15

where it would make a difference to draw an

16

adverse inference against a defendant in that

17

situation.

18

And at that point, I

So I can't imagine any case

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yeah, I guess my

19

questions are just that it seems odd for

20

something that is understood to be a part of

21

the criminal case, I don't -- I -- I -- I take

22

it that you have no continuing objection to

23

that view either -­

24
25

MS. PRELOGAR:

That's right.

this is part of the criminal case.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

We think

Official
25
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, you know, it just

2

seems odd for something that is -- is clearly

3

part of a criminal case to say:

4

government can draw an adverse inference, but

5

don't worry, we won't, it will never come up;

6

and, yes, the government could force him to

7

testify against himself, but don't worry, we

8

would have to give him immunity and we -- and

9

we wouldn't want to do that.

10
11
12

Yes, the

It just seems conceptually a difficult
position.
MS. PRELOGAR:

Well, I think that the

13

reason we think that that is so and that those

14

things are permissible is because the

15

consequence of that probable cause hearing is

16

simply an interim step in the criminal

17

procedure that will -- that will then go on to

18

the criminal trial.

19

And I think that in the context of

20

that proceeding, where the defendant's not

21

exposed to the risk that those statements are

22

going to be used for the really consequential

23

things, for guilt and punishment, he hasn't

24

functioned as a witness against himself -­

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

the possibility of his being found guilty and

with this Court's decision in Estelle versus

JUSTICE BREYER:

What -- what about

4

other things?

I mean, how does it work?

I've

5

-- I've not conducted grand juries, some of my

6

colleagues have, but, I mean, I can imagine all

7

kinds of unconstitutionally seized evidence.

8

It could violate the Fourth Amendment.

confession.

It could violate any one of 15 -­

11

not 15, but, you know, five or six different

12

constitutional prohibitions.

13

And if the prosecutor says I'm going

14

to go and introduce all this stuff before the

15

grand jury, does then a defendant have no

16

remedy whatsoever?

17

MS. PRELOGAR:

Well, that's what this

18

Court has held in cases like Lawn and Calandra,

19

that a defendant -­

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then does that happen

21

all the time, that in grand juries they

22

introduce coerced confessions, they introduce

23

24

MS. PRELOGAR:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

experience.

2

MS. PRELOGAR:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

I -- I -­
They introduce

4

illegally seized evidence, they introduce all

5

this constitutionally impermissible evidence.

6

MS. PRELOGAR:

Well, the issue,

7

Justice Breyer, is I think that oftentimes it

8

won't be apparent from the outset that the

9

evidence was obtained in -- in violation of the

10

Constitution.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

I just want to know

12

what happens.

I guess this is not relevant to

13

what happens, but I -- I -- I can be educated.

14

MS. PRELOGAR:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

I can tell you -­
And it seems like an

important point.

17

MS. PRELOGAR:

I can tell you that at

18

pretrial probable cause hearings, both under

19

the federal rule, this is Rule 5.1, and in the

20

majority of state jurisdictions, defendants are

21

prohibited by rule from challenging the

22

admission of evidence on grounds that it was

23

unlawfully acquired.

24
25

Now that doesn't mean that they lack a
remedy.

They can file a motion to suppress,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
29
1

they can get that issue resolved before they

2

have to face the consequence of either taking a

3

plea or going to trial.

4

But I think what those rules recognize

5

-- and there are other distinctions between the

6

body of evidence that's available at the

7

probable cause hearing as well.

8

routinely admitted.

9

Hearsay is

So I think what those rules recognize

10

is that a probable cause hearing is

11

fundamentally distinct from the issues that are

12

going to be resolved at the guilt stage.

13

It's a lesser consequence for the

14

defendant.

15

possibly having his conviction and punishment

16

adjudicated.

17

He doesn't face the exposure to

And for that reason, courts have

18

recognized, and this Court in cases like

19

Gerstein and Brinegar and Barber, have

20

recognized that a defendant doesn't have the

21

same right to have that determination made on

22

the body of evidence that would be admissible

23

at trial.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Prelogar, suppose

we rule against you on this issue.

Do you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
30
1

think that had -- that that would have

2

necessary consequences for any other kinds of

3

proceedings?

4

MS. PRELOGAR:

I think it would depend

5

on the basis on which this Court ruled against

6

us.

7

Now I understand that Respondent has

8

suggested some ways to narrow what I understand

9

to be the Tenth Circuit's rule in this case

10

where, as I read the Tenth Circuit's opinion,

11

once you're in the criminal case, all

12

proceedings are covered.

13

And Respondent identifies some

14

limiting constructions that I think would limit

15

the number of procedures to which the rule

16

would apply, looking at things like what is the

17

legal issue being resolved in the case and what

18

is the potential consequence.

19

So, in that sense, I think that the

20

Court could write an opinion that narrows down

21

on the probable cause hearing that was at issue

22

here.

But, ultimately, if the Court were -­

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And how about -- Mr.

24

Heytens spent some time talking about Gerstein

25

hearings.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
31
1

Do you think that this is the same -­

2

identical to Gerstein hearings so that whatever

3

we did here we would have to do there, or do

4

you think a distinction can be drawn between

5

the two?

6

In other words, if you -- if we rule

7

against you, will the government come back the

8

next time and say, Ah, we lose now, or will you

9

have a good argument to make?

10

MS. PRELOGAR:

I'm -- I'm sure we

11

would not lose, or hopefully not.

12

argument we would make would then look at the

13

purpose of the Gerstein hearing and would say

14

the purpose there is to determine whether

15

pretrial detention should continue.

16

I think the

And that would be a different purpose

17

than the probable cause determination, which is

18

a bind-over determination.

19

actually that focus on purpose shows why we

20

should prevail in this case, because the -- the

21

purpose of this proceeding is fundamentally

22

different and fundamentally distinct from the

23

kinds of issues that a defendant will face at

24

trial, and from -­

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I think

Here, it is to -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
32
1

it is to determine whether there's enough

2

evidence to go to trial.

3

you're conceding that the evidence couldn't

4

come in at trial, but it can be used to

5

determine whether there's enough evidence to go

6

to trial.

7

And on the one hand,

That seems strange.
MS. PRELOGAR:

Well, I think, again,

8

Justice Ginsburg, this goes back to the lesser

9

consequences of a probable cause hearing.

It's

10

not meant to be a full dress rehearsal for

11

trial, and it's not meant to necessarily

12

resolve exactly what evidence is going to be

13

admissible at trial.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But how can you

15

use, to determine whether there's enough

16

evidence to go to trial, evidence that can't

17

come in at trial?

18

MS. PRELOGAR:

And again, I think that

19

that's not anomalous when you look at how these

20

proceedings generally operate with the

21

admission of hearsay, for example, with the

22

admission of evidence that might later be

23

determined to have violated the Fourth

24

Amendment.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I suppose you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
33
1

don't know at the probable cause hearing

2

whether it's going to be admissible or not

3

because you may not have the defendant's

4

argument, the defendant's side of the case.

5
6

I mean, that's the whole point about
the grand jury proceedings.

7

MS. PRELOGAR:

Exactly.

And I think

8

that that would also be a problem with trying

9

to apply this rule to the Gerstein hearing and

10

to other proceedings where there aren't those

11

same adversarial safeguards or adversarial

12

presentations.

13

I think if this Court were to adopt a

14

rule like the one the Tenth Circuit adopted

15

here, then it really would gum up the works

16

essentially by forcing adjudication of those

17

suppression questions at the outset of a case

before any issue could be resolved, before the

19

Gerstein determination could be made or bail

set.

defendant would then have to do to preserve an

argument.

3

And -- and this Court has earlier -­

in earlier cases observed that a lot of times

at the outset of a case the suppression

question might be complicated and

7

fact-intensive.

8

A defendant might not realize

And so to put the onus on him to -­

There's a lot of

11

jurisdictions who already give defendants those

12

rights to do it right at the beginning of the

13

case.

14

don't, because there's a lot of reasons why a

15

defendant doesn't want to do it early on.

16

Some exercise it.

MS. PRELOGAR:

Some don't.

A lot

Well, there's certainly

17

a lot of variants in how state jurisdictions

18

handle this issue, but I think the -- the

19

problem -­

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

seem gummed up in the way that you're

22

anticipating this will create a problem.

23

MS. PRELOGAR:

Very few of them

Well, that's, I think,

24

because, as -- as we read the criminal cases,

25

that this issue hasn't largely arisen, and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

there hasn't been a requirement that courts

2

adjudicate suppression questions in the

3

sequencing of preliminary proceedings before

4

they resolve other issues in the case.

5

If this Court were to instead adopt a

6

broader rule and find that any use in any

7

proceeding in a criminal case could violate the

8

Fifth Amendment, then I expect that it would

require substantial changes to the criminal

MS. CORKRAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Our test for a violation of the

19

Self-Incrimination Clause is the one this Court

20

has always applied:

21

incriminating statement cannot be used in a

22

criminal case.

23

A compelled testimonial

That test has four requirements.

Each

24

of them comes directly from the Fifth

25

Amendment's text, and Petitioner concedes three

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
36
1

of them here:

2

compelled, that it was used in a criminal case,

3

and that it was by a witness, which means it

4

was testimonial.

5

That the statement was

That leaves only the requirement that

6

the statement be against himself.

This Court

7

has long recognized that a statement is against

8

someone when it can be used to criminally

9

prosecute them, when it is incriminating.

10

Petitioner does not contest that

11

Officer Vogt's statement was incriminating.

12

Instead, it urges the Court to redefine the

13

word "against" so that the clause no longer

14

applies in any criminal case but only in the

15

portion of the criminal case where guilt is

16

ultimately adjudicated.

17

There are numerous fatal flaws with

18

this theory.

19

Amendment's text.

20

I'll start with the Fifth

Petitioner has no explanation for why

21

the framers would have chosen this circuitous

22

way to limit the clause's application.

23

framers had intended the clause to apply only

24

in criminal trials, they wouldn't have hidden

25

that limitation in the word "against."

Heritage Reporting Corporation

If the

would have just said "in any criminal trial"

instead of "any criminal case."

And it's particularly implausible that
--

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, you seem to

6

assume that in a probable cause hearing the

7

state has gathered all of its evidence, that

8

it's -- that it's done all of its

9

investigation, that it has all of its witnesses

10

in order, but that's just not the way probable

11

cause hearings work.

12

MS. CORKRAN:

No, certainly not.

13

Probable cause is a very low bar.

14

Kaley the Court described it as a reasonable

15

belief that the defendant committed the crime.

16

I think in

And so, once we get to that probable

17

cause hearing, if the government has enough

18

evidence to meet that bar outside of the -- the

19

defendant's compelled statement, then there's

20

no reason to get into this issue here.

21

will be able to show probable cause.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

They

No, but -- but the

23

point is the government might not have readily

24

available the evidence that it ultimately will

25

use.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
38
1

MS. CORKRAN:

Yes, but once we're at

2

the point where we have this adversarial

3

courtroom proceeding, which is the last step

4

before moving to trial, if all the government

5

has at that point to prove probable cause is

6

the defendant's compelled statement, then it

7

makes enormous sense to figure out at that

8

stage whether that statement is admissible or

9

not for the reason Justice Ginsburg pointed out

10

earlier, which is 95 percent of the time this

11

hearing is the whole ball game.

12

Once the prosecution gets its probable

13

cause determination, the vast majority of

14

defendants will choose to plead instead of -­

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that's very -­

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, right.

17

But the plea will -- the content of the plea

18

agreement will be affected by whether or not

19

the statements are going to be admissible at

20

trial.

21

prosecutor doesn't have to worry about that in

22

deciding what plea to offer.

23

It's not as if they don't -- the

MS. CORKRAN:

Yes.

Well, the -- but

24

the defendant will be in a position where they

25

won't know about that admissibility

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
39

determination until they've already rolled the

2

dice and gone to trial.

3

of defendants are going to take the more

4

conservative route and take that guilty plea

5

even though the -- the government it turns out

6

didn't have even enough evidence to show

7

probable cause.

8
9

And the vast majority

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
know that that's true.

Well, I don't

They have -- if they're

10

represented by counsel, counsel can look at it

11

and say:

12

to use this, so don't plea to that.

13

they'll offer something else.

14

that it's going to be resolved in a plea

15

bargain context rather than an actual trial, I

16

just don't see the pertinence of that.

17

Look, they're never going to be able

MS. CORKRAN:

Yeah.

Maybe

But the fact

I mean, the

18

admissibility of a statement, sometimes it's

going to be clear here, when you're talking

about a compelled Garrity statement, it's

obviously not admissible.

12

previously haven't done it for whatever set of

13

historical reasons, this will suddenly be

14

subject to a lot of attacks.

15

So that makes me pretty careful.

16

MS. CORKRAN:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah.
And for that reason,

18

I looked up whether you objected, because I do

19

not see how the magistrate running the -- the

20

preliminary hearing can know what to do unless

21

somebody tells him that these statements were

22

taken in violation of the Fifth Amendment.

23
24
25

One, I don't see where you ever did
tell the magistrate that.
Two, looking at the transcript of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

preliminary hearing, I couldn't find any

2

instance where any of the compelled statements

3

were introduced into the preliminary hearing.

4

So what I would like you to do is to

5

tell me what pages to look at in the

6

preliminary transcript, which I have here,

which will show that you did object or at least

that some of the compelled statements were

about material and something that's not in the

point out that it's not in the record.

a reason we can find things to what's in the

if it's not in the record.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There's

But the -­
How do we know

10

that it's been adequately -- had a chance for

11

people to object to it and all that?

12

it's not just a passing comment that it's not

13

in the record.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's -­

Nor -- nor is

15

actually mine a passing comment because Article

16

III of the Constitution says we are to take

17

real cases and controversies.

18

MS. CORKRAN:

Yeah.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

And to decide a major

20

matter where, in fact, going from what is in

21

the record to an earlier stage of this and

22

discovering if it's true, that there was no

23

instance about which you are complaining, in my

24

mind raises the question as to whether this is,

25

in fact, an appropriate case or controversy for

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
43
1

the Court to take.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

supposed to decide whether the cases are

4

controversies according to law.

5

I'm concerned, coming in and saying I want to

6

know about this thing that's not in the record

7

is no different from somebody else coming off

8

the street and saying:

9

know what happened in this case.

And as far as

Hey, wait a minute, I

10

MS. CORKRAN:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

And we're

So -­

So -­
-- go ahead

and answer it.

13

MS. CORKRAN:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

question that you've been presented with.

16

17
18

Yeah.

But I want you to -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's a

You don't have to

MS. CORKRAN:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

answers because it's not something that's in

23

the record.

24
25

I'm just saying I will discount the

MS. CORKRAN:

Yeah.

So it's really

important to explain that the reason it's not

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
44
1

in the record is because Petitioner chose to

2

seek this Court's interlocutory review at the

3

pleading stage.

4

And so that is why Petitioner has not

5

raised any of those questions before this

6

Court.

7

complaint adequately alleges that the statement

8

was used in the probable cause hearing.

9

Petitioner is not contesting that.

10

It is conceded at this point that the

And so none of these questions are

11

ripe for resolution at this point because of

12

Petitioner's cert strategy.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

And so -­

Well, this is a very

14

-- this is a very odd case.

15

case of involving -- it's not a case where you

16

had a right to take an appeal.

17

where we decided to -- we decided to take it,

18

where the city had a right to take the -- to

19

take an appeal.

20

And it wasn't a

It's a case

But let me ask you this:

What -- did

21

the -- did the city violate the Fifth Amendment

22

at the time when the officer was questioned?

23

MS. CORKRAN:

No.

The violation was

24

not complete until the statement was used in

25

the criminal case.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1
2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Then why are you suing

the city?

3

MS. CORKRAN:

So Section 1983

4

establishes liability for causing the

5

deprivation of a constitutional right.

6

want to point out Petitioner has not challenged

7

in this Court whether we have adequately

8

alleged proximate causation.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

And I

In answering -­

10

MS. CORKRAN:

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

I understand that.
Yeah.
I'm just trying to

12

understand this seems like a very odd case and

13

I'm just trying to understand what's really

14

involved.

That's one thing that -- that -­

15

MS. CORKRAN:

Yeah.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

17

MS. CORKRAN:

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- I don't understand.
So -- so I'll say -­
How did they cause the

19

-- the -- what will your theory be as to how

20

they caused this prosecution?

21

MS. CORKRAN:

Yeah.

So the Tenth

22

Circuit applied settled law with regard to

23

proximate causation.

24

appeals have held that cause in Section 1983

25

incorporates common law principles of -- of

All of the court of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
46
1

proximate causation.

2

So what the Tenth Circuit said is that

3

when the police chief went to the Kansas Bureau

4

of Investigation and said:

5

Vogt's compelled statements, you should

6

initiate a criminal investigation, it was

7

reasonably foreseeable that that -- those

8

statements would ultimately be introduced in

9

the criminal case.

Here are Officer

And I'll say that the Ninth

10

Circuit and the Seventh Circuit, or I guess the

11

Sixth Circuit, have addressed very similar

12

circumstances and come to the same conclusion.

13

So I'm not aware of any circuit split

14

on this issue, but it's certainly not before

15

this Court.

16

That's a Section 1983 question.

Petitioner has chosen to present to

17

this Court the Fifth Amendment question.

18

a constitutional question.

19

going on below will be decided on remand.

20

--

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's

Everything that's
So

Counsel, just so

22

we're clear, the -- I think the concurring

23

opinion in this case did a very good job of

24

pointing out that all of the questions that are

25

being asked, both by Justice Alito and by

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
47
1

Justice Breyer, there is a substantial question

2

about whether any of these statements were

3

compelled.

4

MS. CORKRAN:

Yeah.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There is a

6

substantial question about whether there was an

7

objection or not.

8

that the concurrent said still had to be

9

decided, correct?

10

There are lots of questions

MS. CORKRAN:

Yeah.

And so, if this

11

Court wanted to dig the case as improvidently

12

granted, we would certainly not object.

13

think we said in our brief in opposition that

14

we thought it was premature to take this

15

question at this time, but -- but I can

continue to talk about the record -- okay.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

I

Could I just go

back?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
48
1

MS. CORKRAN:

Yeah.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There is a circuit

3

split on this.

4

side, three circuits on the other -- four now

5

on the other side.

6

There's three circuits on one

Among those four are now the Tenth,

7

the Ninth, the Seventh, and the Second who

8

support your position.

9

MS. CORKRAN:

10

Yeah.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do you know

11

whether the works have been gummed up in those

12

circuits?

13

MS. CORKRAN:

There is no evidence

14

they've been gummed up.

15

about the -- the asserted circuit split, the

16

cases that are supposedly in support of the

17

Petitioner's position, none of them actually

18

addressed a circumstance where you had a

19

post-charge pretrial use of the compelled

20

statement.

21

Chavez, where the defendant, or the -- I guess

22

the plaintiff, was attempting to rely on

23

pre-charge compulsion to make a Fifth Amendment

24

claim.

25

And I also want to say

They were all cases similar to

Now, in doing so -- well, I should

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
49
1

clarify that in at least one of those cases the

2

compelled statement was also used to initiate

3

the charges.

4
5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, unless you can

distinguish this from the grand jury -­

6

MS. CORKRAN:

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah.
-- it's -- the issue

8

has enormous implications for the reasons that

9

were brought out by Justice Breyer's questions.

10

So how could you distinguish this from

11

the grand jury?

12

MS. CORKRAN:

Yeah.

So I'm going to

13

attempt to answer that concisely with the

14

caveat that it would take an entire second set

15

of briefs to adequately address the nuances of

16

the Court's grand jury jurisprudence, which is

17

why neither we nor the government attempted

18

that.

19

complicated question, but my -- my best simple

20

answer is that Hubbell and Counselman hold that

21

the clause applies to grand injuries.

22

This is just a very different and more

With this added limitation from Lawn,

23

Calandra, and Williams, the courts don't have

24

authority to crack open indictments because of

25

the grand jury's status as an independent

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
50
1

constitutional fixture.

2

assigned to the judicial branch.

3

It's not textually

That said, courts do crack open

4

indictments all the time.

That's the whole

5

point of a Kastigar hearing.

6

finds that jury -- a grand jury has made use or

7

derivative use of a compelled immunized

8

statement, the remedy is to dismiss the

9

indictment itself unlawful.

And when a court

That is

10

irreconcilable with Petitioner's theory that

11

it's perfectly fine for the government to use

12

compelled statements all the way up to the

13

point of trial.

14

So, as a practical matter -­

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Corkran, suppose

16

that I just did not want to go into the grand

17

jury business, mostly because I think that

18

there is this very long tradition of not

19

cracking them open unless we have to.

20

MS. CORKRAN:

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.
And, you know, it

22

might be that there is the same right in the

23

grand jury context, but we've just decided in a

24

wide variety of ways that that right does not

25

get remedied in the same way, as easily, as

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
51
1

quickly, as anything, as in other contexts.

2
3
4

Would it be -- wouldn't that be
correct?
MS. CORKRAN:

Yes, that's fine and -­

5

and that's as far as we went in our -- our

6

briefing because, again, this is such a

7

complicated question.

8

Lawn-Calandra-Williams limitation on cracking

9

open indictments would not apply to probable

But, yes, the -- the

10

cause hearings, both because the -- the unique

11

historical posture isn't there but also because

12

the nature of the proceeding is so different.

13

A probable cause hearing is an adversarial

14

courtroom proceeding before a judge, so there

15

isn't anything to crack open.

16

So that leads to Petitioner's policy

17

point about whether it makes sense to apply the

18

clause to probable cause hearings in a way

19

that's different than how the clause applies to

20

grand juries.

21

question in Coleman v. Alabama when it said

22

that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel

23

applies to probable cause hearings, the exact

24

sort of probable cause hearing we have at issue

25

here, even though that right does not apply to

And this Court answered that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
52
1
2

grand juries.
And Justice White's concurrence made

3

the same ominous predictions about the death of

4

probable cause hearings that Petitioner has

5

made here, and it didn't happen.

6

later, and the vast majority of states are

7

still using probable cause hearings as the

8

primary mechanism for pursuing felony

9

prosecutions, even though the right to counsel

It's 48 years

10

is surely more burdensome on the state than the

11

self-incrimination privilege.

12

So I'd like to go back to the Court's

13

precedent because I think this is important.

14

Not once in the history of this country has

15

this Court relied on the term "witness against

16

itself" -- "himself" to limit when the use of a

17

compelled incriminating testimonial statement

18

violates the clause.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what is your

20

test for determining whether a proceeding is

21

part of the criminal case for these purposes?

22

MS. CORKRAN:

So I would look to the

23

-- the Court's definition of criminal

24

prosecution in Rothgery because we know that a

25

criminal case is at least as broad as a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
53
1

criminal prosecution.

2

the defendant's first appearance before a

3

judicial officer where he is formally told of

4

the charges against him and deprivations are

5

imposed on his liberty.

6

question that that covers the probable cause

7

hearing here.

8
9

And Rothgery says it's

And there's no

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How do you

distinguish Estelle?

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

11

MS. CORKRAN:

Does it -­
So -- so Estelle was a

12

case about competency.

13

Estelle was that the defendant's rights had

14

been violated by the use of his psychiatric

15

exam at his sentencing proceeding.

16

holding in itself forecloses the notion that

17

the clause is only a trial right.

18

What the Court held in

So that

What Petitioner and the government are

19

latching onto are two sentences of dicta where

20

the Court said:

21

had been limited to its function of determining

22

whether the defendant understood the charges

23

against him and was capable of assisting in his

24

own defense, then a Fifth Amendment problem

25

wouldn't have arose.

Well, if the psychiatric exam

Official
54
1

That is consistent with our position,

2

and I'll explain why.

3

part of a criminal case, I imagine, most of the

4

time, but the other three requirements of the

5

clause are going to substantially limit its

6

application to those hearings.

7

A competency hearing is

So Estelle explains that a routine

8

competency exam is focused exclusively on

9

whether the defendant understands the charges

10

against him and is capable of assisting in his

11

own defense.

12

require extracting testimonial incriminating

13

statements from the defendant.

14

That determination does not

And to the extent that the defendant

15

has volunteered to put competency at issue, it

16

might not even be compelled.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

So -­

But your answer is,

18

though, but in general, then, the -- the clause

19

does not apply or does apply in a competency

20

hearing?

21

MS. CORKRAN:

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

So the clause -­
The evidence -­

23

evidence obtained in violation of the -- the

24

privilege would be admissible in a competency

25

hearing or not?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
55
1

MS. CORKRAN:

Yeah.

So, in the narrow

2

circumstance where a defendant has been forced

3

to undergo a psychiatric exam and, in answering

4

those questions, he makes a compelled

5

incriminating testimonial statement, no, that

6

can't be admitted in the competency hearing

7

because it's part of the criminal case.

8
9

But that limitation shouldn't affect
the utility of competency hearings.

I think

10

it's important to point out Estelle didn't even

11

involve a competency hearing.

12

psychiatrist had sent a letter to the judge

13

that simply said:

14

understands the difference between right and

15

wrong and understands the charges against him

16

and is capable of assisting his defense.

17
18
19

There, the

I find that the defendant

JUSTICE ALITO:

So what about a

Gerstein hearing and a bail hearing?
MS. CORKRAN:

Yeah.

So a Gerstein

20

hearing is not part of the criminal case

21

because it's a Fourth Amendment requirement.

22

It's a substitute for an arrest warrant.

23

this Court fleshed that point out well last

24

term in Manuel v. City of Joliet.

25

Gerstein itself explains that because it's a

So

And so

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
56
1

Fourth Amendment requirement, the whole panoply

2

of rights in the Sixth Amendment do not apply

3

to Gerstein hearings.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

But I thought you said

5

that the -- that the criminal case begins when

6

the -- when the defendant is -- appears in

7

court and is called upon to answer the charges.

8
9
10

MS. CORKRAN:

Yes.

So I don't know

that a Gerstein hearing -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

That's not -- a

11

Gerstein doesn't satisfy that?

12

MS. CORKRAN:

No, the point of a -­

13

well, it depends on whether -- when you would

14

have the Gerstein hearing, but the Gerstein

15

hearing that's contemplated by Gerstein is this

16

hearing within 48 hours of arrest -­

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

18

MS. CORKRAN:

Yeah.
-- where the purpose is

19

to get the arrest warrant after the fact.

20

There's no reason that the Fifth Amendment

21

requirements would apply to that hearing when

22

the Sixth Amendment requirements don't.

23

It's -- it's -- to the extent that

24

it's happening at the same time of the -- as

25

the criminal case, it's -- it's happening in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
57

parallel.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Wouldn't it -- in a

3

criminal -- in a federal case, if there's a

4

complaint, wouldn't it begin at the time of the

5

filing of the complaint?

6

beginning of the criminal case?

7

MS. CORKRAN:

Wouldn't that be the

Yeah.

So a Gerstein

hearing -- the Gerstein determination could be

9

folded into something that's happening within

10

the criminal case.

11

12

quickly file charges and then fold the Gerstein

13

hearing into the arraignment.

14

nothing requiring states to do that.

15

So I understand that to
The -- the state will

But there's

So, in an emergency situation where a

16

state -- you know, they need to take physical

17

custody of someone who has confessed to

18

murdering their whole family, this -- the

19

clause would not prohibit the government from

20

then getting that Gerstein determination based

21

on the confession and then later pulling

22

together the evidence necessary to make the

23

probable cause showing in court.

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

25

I'm just not -- I'm

not following your answer.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MS. CORKRAN:

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

In a federal case,

3

when a complaint is filed, is that not the

4

beginning of the criminal case, in your view,

5

so that everything that happens after that is

6

part of the criminal case?

7

MS. CORKRAN:

8

Yes, that's right.
First appearance -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

Could we say, in your

5

opinion, before a plaintiff in a 1983 case can

6

bring a claim, that the preliminary hearing

7

consider -- considered matters that were taken

8

in violation of the Fifth Amendment, they must

9

allege in their complaint that they objected

10

before the hearing, for otherwise the

11

magistrate would have no idea what he is

12

supposed to do?

13
14

MS. CORKRAN:

asked this Court to interpret Section 1983.

15
16

So Petitioner has not

JUSTICE BREYER:

I know they haven't.

I'm asking.

17

MS. CORKRAN:

Yeah.

So I think that's

18

a question of statutory interpretation and

19

congressional intent.

20

limit Section 1983 that way, it could.

21

If Congress wanted to

But there's no indication in the plain

22

language of Section 1983 that it is limited in

23

that way.

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:
the answer to this?

Well, then what is

There are many, many ways

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
61
1

in which a -- a statement by an individual

2

could violate the -- incrimination.

3

case, he is asked questions by his superiors in

4

the police department under threat of

5

leaving -­

6

MS. CORKRAN:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

In this

Yeah.
-- and they don't

8

know that he considers that to be a violation

9

of the Fifth Amendment.

10

MS. CORKRAN:

Well, but the -­

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then those statements

12

go to court in a preliminary hearing, and the

13

magistrate doesn't know that the person

14

considers them to be a violation of the Fifth

15

Amendment.

16

What are the magistrates and the

17

police department supposed to do?

18

necessarily conversant with all the facts of

19

the case, if no one objects.

20

MS. CORKRAN:

Yeah.

They're not

So I want to

21

start by saying that this Court held in

22

Minnesota v. Murphy that a Garrity privilege is

23

self-executing, that when an employee is in a

24

situation where their boss says to them you

25

will lose your job if you don't make these

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
62
1

statements, it self-executes.

2

have to raise the privilege at -- at that

3

moment.

4

So you don't

But -- and with response to or in

5

response to what the -- the state is supposed

6

to do, what happened here is highly unusual.

7

Since the 1970s, the Department of Justice and

8

police departments across the country have

9

developed best practices to ensure that

10

compelled statements are not used in criminal

11

investigations.

12

So, once a statement is compelled via

13

an administrative investigation or a grant of

14

immunity, that statement is then formally

15

siloed from any criminal investigation.

16

So what happened here, the police

17

chief's decision to take this compelled

18

statement and hand it to the Kansas Bureau of

19

Investigation and say you should investigate

20

this was highly unusual and, frankly, very hard

21

to understand, given the ubiquity of Garrity

22

protocols in this country.

23

So I -- to go back to your point

24

earlier about whether this is a dramatic

25

revolution, it's not.

What we're proposing

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1

here is what the law has always been.

2

All -- all police departments across

3

the country and the Department of Justice would

4

say, even before this case coming before the

5

Court, that what the police chief did here was

6

-- was illegal.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I don't

8

understand.

You -- you talk about it being -­

9

being siloed and not being -- so the idea is

10

you're supposed to pretend that the person

11

didn't say what he said in conducting the

12

investigation?

13

MS. CORKRAN:

Yes.

So the best

14

practices is that whoever was involved in -- in

15

taking that compelled statement is then siloed

16

themselves from the criminal investigation so

17

that the -- the government can prove that the

18

-- the criminal investigation and the ultimate

19

prosecution happened entirely independent of -­

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, so if

21

the person says -- you know, they say you've

22

got to tell me what happened or you'll be

23

fired, and the person says, you know, I buried

24

the body here, he's not supposed to tell

25

anybody?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64
1

MS. CORKRAN:

Well, if he was asking

2

that question as part of an administrative

3

investigation -­

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

MS. CORKRAN:

6
7
8
9

Yeah.

-- then -- then, yes,

you can't use that statement.
Now there could be an independent
criminal investigation -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I just want to

10

make sure I understand.

11

it and said do you have anything to do with

12

this, the disappearance, and the person says, I

13

buried the body next to this barn, the person

14

at that point is supposed to say, okay, I'm

15

going to turn this over to Fred and I'm not

16

going to tell him anything?

17

MS. CORKRAN:

So he's investigating

So you're talking about

18

a government employer making that inquiry of an

19

employee as part of an administrative

20

investigation -­

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

MS. CORKRAN:

Yes.

-- or is the government

23

-- so, under those circumstances, once the

24

government gives the grant of immunity, no,

25

that cannot be used.

That's -- that's been the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
65
1

law since Kastigar and Garrity.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There's no

3

grant of immunity.

4

tell us or I'm going to fire you.

5

words, the same thing here, that it's a

6

compelled statement.

7

There's a -- you've got to

MS. CORKRAN:

Yes.

In other

So then it's a

8

compelled statement, and the privilege is

9

self-executing at least -­

10
11
12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

For the

purposes of an ongoing investigation?
MS. CORKRAN:

Yeah.

Yeah.

And if

13

that were not the -- the -- if that were not

14

the rule, so if Petitioner's theory would

15

correct -- was correct, then the disincentives

16

for employee cooperation in those sorts of

17

administrative investigations would skyrocket

18

because, if the grant of immunity only applies

19

at trial, you could compel those statements

20

from the employee at pain of losing their job

21

and then turn around and use those statements

22

to criminally prosecute them, keep them in

23

custody all the way up to the point of the

24

criminal trial, at which -­

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So, if the employer

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
66
1

requires a statement to be made and the

2

employee says that a crime was committed, the

3

employer cannot tell the Police Department?

4

MS. CORKRAN:

Yes, that's been the

5

rule since Garrity and -- and Kastigar.

Now I

6

do want to distinguish between unwarned

7

statements and compelled statements.

8

unwarned statement, where the Miranda rights

9

are not read, is not necessarily a

So an

10

constitutional violation.

11

prophylactic exclusionary rule that the court

12

may or may not extend to preliminary hearings.

13

That is a

But when it comes to a compelled

14

statement, whether immunized or not, the

15

Constitution is very clear.

16

in a criminal case.

17

the framers intended as well.

18

framers based the clause on a common law

19

privilege that specifically applied to

20

preliminary proceedings.

21

It cannot be used

And -- and that was what

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We know that the

This is such an

22

odd case because I'm not quite sure that there

23

was a compelled statement at all, if the facts

24

as I've read them -- and I know they're not in

25

the record and I know what the Chief says -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
67
1

but, first of all, no employer -- his employer

2

didn't compel these statements.

3

employer because he wanted a different job.

4
5

MS. CORKRAN:

He went to his

That was true for the

first statement, yeah.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

On the

7

second statement, he went to his chief and

8

said:

9

I'm resigning.
MS. CORKRAN:

No, sorry.

So that's

10

not -- that's not actually correct.

11

voluntarily made the first statement to the

12

police chief.

13

he had -- needed to document what had happened

14

on pain of losing his job.

15

compelled statement.

16

So he

The police chief then told him

That is the

Then, after he made that statement, he

17

tendered his resignation, and then there was a

18

third statement in which he gave more details

19

about what had happened.

20

question of the impact of the -- the

21

resignation on that third statement is up for

22

grabs.

23
24
25

So it's -- the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I had a -­

but that's what's going to be litigated below.
MS. CORKRAN:

Yes.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
68
1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I thought he had

2

announced his resignation before there was a

3

request for additional -­

4

MS. CORKRAN:

Yeah.

So -- so in the

5

complaint, that -- that resignation happened

6

between the second and the third statement.

7
8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
it.

9

MS. CORKRAN:

10
11
12

That -- I'll take

Okay.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But it's still an

odd case.
MS. CORKRAN:

It is.

And, again, it's

13

an odd case because Petitioner chose to seek

14

this Court's review at the pleading stage and

15

Petitioner chose to present only the Fifth

16

Amendment question to this Court.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

If this case -- if

18

this case goes to trial, you will prove that

19

the officer suffered damage as a result of the

20

probable cause hearing or as a result of having

21

been -- as a result of the admission that he

22

made under alleged -- allegedly under

23

compulsion by the city?

24
25

MS. CORKRAN:

So it would be the use

of the statement in the probable cause hearing.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

The complaint alleges emotional damages,

2

reputational damage, loss of income.

3

punitive damages.

4

the adequacy of those allegations.

5

Seeks

Petitioner has not contested

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah, but you -- you

6

will prove that the reason why he didn't get

7

the job with the other police department was

8

the probable cause hearing and not the

9

statement that he made?

10

MS. CORKRAN:

No, that would be

11

inconsistent with the complaint.

12

says that the City of Haysville withdrew the

13

job offer at the point of the criminal

14

investigation by the -- the Kansas Bureau.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The complaint

That has nothing

16

to do with the probable cause hearing.

17

wanted the probable cause hearing, so how could

18

the statement have hurt him?

19

prove damage?

20

MS. CORKRAN:

He

How can he put -­

Yeah, I would just say,

21

on this record, Petitioner has not challenged

the adequacy of those allegations.

23

minimum, he would be entitled to nominal

24

damages.

25

At a

So I want to just emphasize that what

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
70
1

we're talking about here is an incriminating

2

testimonial statement that the government has

3

extracted from the defendant against his will.

4

There is nothing radical about saying that the

5

government should not be able to use that

6

statement for any purpose in a criminal case.

7

That is -- that was the framers'

8

position.

They found it offensive to a

9

civilized system of justice to allow

10

prosecutors to -- to enlist defendants as

11

instruments in their own condemnation.

12

thought it was crucial to our democracy that

13

prosecutions proceed based on the independent

14

labor of the government's officers.

15

Petitioner's theory to the contrary

16

should be rejected.

17

other questions.

They

I'm happy to answer any

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you,

21

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TOBY J. HEYTENS

22

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

23

MR. HEYTENS:

I'd just like to make

24

three quick points in rebuttal:

25

response to Justice Kagan's point about the

One in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
71
1

apparent oddity with regard to this particular

2

proceeding, one about suppression hearings, and

3

one about Garrity.

4

So, in response to Justice Kagan's

5

questions about the oddity of this particular

6

type of hearing, I think beyond the fact that

7

the Supreme Court of Kansas has held that the

8

purpose of this hearing is not to adjudicate

9

guilt or punishment, I think an even more

10

important indication of that is that, under

11

Kansas law, nothing that happened at this

12

hearing could conclusively resolve Officer

13

Vogt's guilt or innocence one way or the other.

14

And the way -- the reason that we know that is

15

because the Supreme Court has specifically held

16

that the dismissal of charges after a probable

17

cause hearing is not preclusive of, and without

18

prejudice to, the state's ability to reinitiate

19

the exact same criminal prosecution.

20

Which is the same rule for grand

21

injures, right?

The Court has said that just

22

because a grand jury refuses to return an

23

indictment does not mean that the prosecution

24

cannot ask another grand jury to return an

25

indictment.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
72
1

And, in fact, the Supreme Court of

2

Kansas has reversed trial courts who have

3

dismissed the probable cause hearing on the

4

theory that the government will not be able to

5

carry its proof beyond a reasonable doubt

6

burden at trial because, they've said, that's

7

not the purpose of this hearing.

8

does not adjudicate guilt or innocence.

9

This hearing

The point on suppression hearings, I

10

think it's just worth emphasizing again in

11

response to Justice Ginsburg's point, we are

12

not talking about the possibility that someone

13

will have to decide to plead guilty without

14

being able to challenge evidence for one very

15

simple reason:

16

to suppress.

17

They can file a pretrial motion

Many -- it is true that a large

18

majority of prosecutions are resolved via

19

guilty plea.

20

pleading guilty, defendants often file pretrial

21

motions to suppress and only plead guilty after

22

the denial of their motion to suppress.

23

But it is also true that before

In the federal system, they are even

24

sometimes permitted to file a conditional

25

guilty plea to preserve their ability to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
73
1

challenge the admissibility of the evidence on

2

appeal.

3

people -- away people's ability to challenge.

4

So we're not talking about taking

And then last but not least, we didn't

5

discuss it in the initial argument, but this

6

Court -- the second argument that we have

7

raised, the second independent argument,

8

relates that this Court could say, whatever the

9

rule might be with regard to other types of

10

Fifth Amendment claims, there can be no Garrity

11

violation until trial.

12

It would actually be very similar to

13

what I understand a super-majority of this

14

Court said in Chavez with regard to Miranda

15

claims.

16

Court was deeply divided about whether there

17

were circumstances in which an involuntariness

18

claim could occur before trial.

19

understood, even some of the dissenting

20

justices in Chavez said a Miranda claim is

21

something that can only accrue until trial.

22

I understand that, in Chavez, the

But, as I

And I think that would make sense when

23

it comes to Garrity claims.

Garrity does not

24

forbid the taking of the statements.

25

be no Garrity violation when the statement is

There can

Heritage Reporting Corporation

taken.

2

later use of the statement.

3

suggest that if the Court doesn't want to reach

4

the broader issue, they could simply say that

5

this type of Fifth Amendment violation cannot

6

occur until the statements are used at trial.

7

The violation under Garrity is the

8

We ask the Court -- we ask that the
judgment below be reversed.

And so we would
