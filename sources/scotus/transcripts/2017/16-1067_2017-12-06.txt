We'll hear

Murphy versus Smith.

Mr. Banner.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART BANNER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. BANNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

When a prisoner wins a civil rights

12

case and he's awarded damages and he's awarded

13

attorney's fees, the prisoner himself has to

14

pay part of the fees out of the damages

15

judgment.

16

specifies the size of the prisoner's share.

17

This is what the statute says:

18

the judgment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall

19

be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney's

20

fees."

21

The statute at issue in this case

"A portion of

In the 20-plus years since the statute

22

was enacted, virtually all the district courts

23

have interpreted it literally.

24

an appropriate portion of the judgment, not

25

exceeding 25 percent, and they deduct that

They identify

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

amount from the attorney fee award payable by

2

the defendant.

3

In our case, the Seventh Circuit read

4

the statute differently to mean that attorney's

5

fees must be taken out of the damages first, up

6

to 25 percent of the damages, so that the

7

defendant is only liable for any fees left

8

over.

9

But the statute does not say that.

10

All it says is that the portion of the judgment

11

-- is that a portion of the judgment no greater

12

than 25 percent must be allocated to fees.

13

Respondents mistakenly suggest that

14

Congress's use of the word "satisfy" indicates

15

that the plaintiff has to pay the largest

16

possible share of the fees in all cases.

17

that can't be right because the statute itself

18

says what share the plaintiff has to pay:

19

portion of the judgment, not exceeding

20

25 percent.

But

a

21

The rest of the attorney's fee award

22

in excess of the plaintiff's share is payable

23

by the defendant, up to the statutory cap of

24

150 percent of the damages.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Your adversary

2

points to a number of statutes that use the

3

verb "to satisfy" -- or I guess not the verb,

4

but the proposition "to satisfy" -- to refer to

5

the complete fulfillment of an obligation.

6

do you distinguish those examples?

7

MR. BANNER:

How

The word "satisfy" often

8

means the complete fulfillment of an

9

obligation, but in this statute, it can't mean

10

that because the statute makes clear that the

11

plaintiff doesn't have to completely fulfill

12

the obligation to pay attorney's fees.

13

statute says exactly how much.

14
15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
to have a cap.

16

The

Well, it's sensible

It's just a cap.

MR. BANNER:

Well, exactly.

17

cap.

18

It's -- it's -- the statute says that the

19

plaintiff's share of the attorney's fees is

20

25 percent or less of the judgment.

21

It's a 25 percent cap.

It's a

That's right.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but you

22

start with the notion of satisfaction; in other

23

words, satisfying a debt.

24

somebody $100 and you give them 50, that person

25

isn't going to say, well, you've satisfied your

I mean, if you owe

Heritage Reporting Corporation

obligation.

2

MR. BANNER:

No, that's right.

And so

3

the -- the -- the word "satisfy" standing alone

4

sometimes often does mean complete payment, but

5

that would make nonsense of the text of this

6

statute.

7

that the plaintiff doesn't have to pay the

8

attorney's fees completely.

The text of this statute makes clear

9
10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no, I

understand the point.

11

MR. BANNER:

Yeah.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But I'm just

13

suggesting that that's not certainly a total

14

response.

15

Justice Kennedy just suggested, there's also a

16

cap.

17

because of the cap, well, that's just the way

18

the statute has balanced the two obligations.

19

But the initial obligation is to satisfy the -­

20

the fees.

21

Yes, you have to satisfy it, but as

And if the reason you can't satisfy it is

MR. BANNER:

Well, you know, there was

22

a provision like that in some of the precursor

23

bills, right, but this -- that sentence was

omitted from the final legislation.

there -- there was a sentence that said exactly

defendant is liable only for fees in excess of

5

was working its way through Congress, Congress

rejected that provision.

7

Congress kept the provision that

appears in the statute -- that appears in the

statute, which says that the plaintiff's share

is 25 percent or less of the judgment.

speaks to fault.

Congress intended any sort of fault-based

Let's assume -­

You don't think that

difficult.

satisfaction, the -- the -- the -- the attorney

25

-- the -- the plaintiff's share is never going

Heritage Reporting Corporation

to literally satisfy the attorney's fee award.

2

And the -- the reason I say that is that the -­

3

the typical judgment in prisoner cases is very,

4

very small.

5

I mean, it's an extraordinarily rare

6

case in which even the maximum 25 percent would

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah, but you could

say that the fee -- that the award has to

satisfy the attorney's fees up to the cap.

11

There wouldn't be anything odd about that.

just seems that -- you don't think that that's

an odd use of the term "satisfy"?

25

MR. BANNER:

Right, but -- but

Heritage Reporting Corporation

12

"satisfy" is often used in other contexts where

2

it's clear that there won't be complete

satisfaction of the relevant obligation.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And -­

You know, you

13

mention that the district courts have

14

overwhelmingly understood 25 to be the most

15

that can come out of the plaintiff's recovery,

16

and you were asked a question about, well,

suppose, nominal, a nominal amount is taken

18

from the plaintiff.

19

Do you know what the practice has been

20

in these 20 years in the district court?

21

we have 10 percent.

22

MR. BANNER:

Here

What is the spread?
The spread is 25 percent

23

at the top and nominal amounts at the bottom.

24

The -- the district courts have actually been

25

implementing the statute in a -- in a sensible

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

way.

2

deciding on the appropriate share for the

3

plaintiff to pay, the district courts have been

considering the extent to which making the

defendant pay a greater share will deter future

misconduct by prison guards, and the extent to

courts have gone down to a minimal amount.
MR. BANNER:

some cases.

14

plaintiff's share is nominal, like a dollar.

15

There's also plenty of cases where the

16

plaintiff's share is the full 25 percent.

There's cases where the -- the

nominal share.

22

mean cases where, say, a prisoner is brutally

raped by a prison guard or where a -- a

24

prisoner is permanently maimed or disfigured by

25

a prison guard.

When I say egregious cases, I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And so there's enough cases out there

2

where, you know, once you see the facts of the

case, you can get a pretty good sense of

case or whether it's going to be something

less.

So, in the yellow brief, page -- page

6

quotation that begins in the third line of that

paragraph, this is -- this is the sentence that

9

Congress could have written, in fact, nearly

10

did write, that would have adopted the

11

Respondents' position.

12

"If the award of attorney's fees is

13

greater than 25 percent of the judgment, the

14

excess shall be paid by the defendant."

15

That would have been it.

That would

16

have adopted Respondents' view of the statute,

17

but that sentence got deleted from the final

18

legislation.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

the -- one way that the discretion of the

21

district court would be guided would be by the

22

seriousness of the offense, and you gave a

23

couple of examples.

24

MR. BANNER:

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You say that

Yeah.
I think it's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

pretty unusual to compensate for seriousness of

2

the defense, or bad faith, I guess, of the -­

3

of the defendant through the -- manipulating

4

the attorney's fees.

5

MR. BANNER:

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah.
Wouldn't it

7

normally in those cases result in a higher

8

award of damages?

9

MR. BANNER:

It is unusual.

And

10

that's because, so far as we know, this statute

11

is the only one of its kind.

12

know, this is the only statute in which

13

Congress has explicitly apportioned

14

responsibility for attorney's fees.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

apportionment doesn't mean that the

17

egregiousness of the conduct should be taken

18

into account in fixing the size of the

19

attorney's fees.

20
21
22
23
24
25

MR. BANNER:

As far as we

Well, but

No, that's right, but the

-- the -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean, that just

doesn't follow.
MR. BANNER:

The question -- if -- if

the question is why is it that we see the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1

consideration of egregiousness with this

2

statute but not with other fee-shifting

3

statutes, what I'm trying to say is this is, so

4

far as we know, the only fee-shifting statute

5

in which responsibility for attorney's fees is

6

apportioned between the plaintiff and the

7

defendant.

8
9

Once you're going to apportion
responsibility for fees between the plaintiff

10

and the defendant, you need a basis for

11

apportioning those fees.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I -- I was

13

talking about the amount of the fee.

14

amount -- does the amount of the fee ever

15

depend on the egregiousness?

16

think it does.

17

MR. BANNER:

Does the

I -- I shouldn't

No, no, the amount of the

18

fee will be calculated by the lodestar method,

19

right.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But in this case, it

21

was -- it was odd that the district judge

22

remitted a substantial part and put the

23

punitive damages down almost $93,000.

24

MR. BANNER:

Right.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But then, in order

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
18
1

to soften the blow, he reduces the amount of -­

2

of attorney's fees.

This -­

3

MR. BANNER:

Right.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

This -- this is a

5

double exercise of discretion that it seems to

6

me quite puzzling.

7

MR. BANNER:

Well, but that sort of

8

discretion I have to say is -- is -- that's a

9

standard feature of fee-shifting statutes.

I

10

mean, fee-shifting statutes -- I mean, Section

11

1988 is a good example.

12

a fee has to be reasonable.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Section 1988 just says

Could you -- could you

14

explain to me why the sentence you read would

15

do the trick?

16

done if the award of attorney's fees is greater

17

than 25 percent.

18

It says what -- what must be

How does that tell the court who pays

1988, which gives a court discretion over

11

everything, this statute tried to pull back on

12

that in various ways.

13

But you're saying that in -- in -- in

14

this particular way when it comes to

15

allocation, we should understand Congress to

16

have left the courts with the full discretion

17

that -- that you can imagine.

18

So why should we read it that way,

19

given that in various other ways the -- the

20

clear aim of Congress was to reduce the court's

21

discretion?

22

MR. BANNER:

I -- I don't -- I don't

23

know that that's an accurate -- I don't think

24

that's an accurate description of the aim of

25

Congress.

Certainly the statute compresses the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
21
1

range of possible fee awards.

2

The -- the fees are capped at

3

150 percent of the judgment.

That's a -­

4

that's a sharp compression of the range of

5

possible awards.

6

Congress preserved virtually all of the

7

district court's discretion under Section 1988

8

because all of the limitations in -- in this

9

statute are all expressed in terms of

But within that range

10

reasonableness, proportionality, and -- and so

11

on.

12

And so the -- the -- this -- this -­

13

the particular provision at issue in our case

14

is just like that.

15

compressed range, compressed by the cap on -­

16

on fees of 150 percent of the damages.

17

It operates within a

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Was -- was the

18

intent to reduce discretion, or I thought the

19

intent was to deter non-meritorious lawsuits?

20

MR. BANNER:

Well, the -- if you -- if

21

you ask about the Prison Litigation Reform Act

22

as a whole, certainly the -- the intent was to

23

deter frivolous lawsuits in order to facilitate

24

the consideration of the stronger ones.

25

This provision has nothing to do with

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
22

frivolous lawsuits.

2

applies when a prisoner has prevailed on the

3

merits, been awarded damages, and been awarded

4

attorney's fees.

This provision only

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, there are

meritorious lawsuits on a scale -­

-- of merit -­

Right.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- some that are

11

serious, some that are not so serious, where

12

there can be an award.

13

So I can see Congress giving

14

discretion based on the nature of the claim.

15

That is more supportive of your position, which

16

is -­

17

MR. BANNER:

Yeah, and that's -- and

18

that's exactly how the district courts have

19

been applying the statute for -- for more than

20

20 years now.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, this is

22

-- it's -- it's a little different.

I

23

understood the objective of Congress, in order

24

to weed out non-meritorious suits, to be to

25

replicate, to the extent they could, the -- the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
23
1

situation of private parties outside of prison.

2

There, if you have a serious injury,

3

you quite often can go to a lawyer who will

4

charge you a contingent fee, say 25 percent,

5

and whatever your recovery, you would owe him

6

25 percent of the -- of the judgment.

7

And you wouldn't owe him only

8

2 percent just because the -- the judge in the

9

case thought, well, you didn't do enough work

10

or you could have done better.

11

MR. BANNER:

Yeah, that's -- that's

12

simply an incorrect view of the statute to say

13

that Congress intended to replicate anything

14

close to a contingent fee regime for prisoners.

15

That could very easily have been accomplished

16

simply by making prisoners completely

17

ineligible for fees under Section 1988.

18

would have thrown prisoners back on a

19

contingent fee regime just like -­

Yeah, but they

could -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But you can

determine that if you're on a straight

Heritage Reporting Corporation

24

contingent basis, that that -- I mean, you have

2

to have enough of an incentive to get lawyers

3

to take the cases and, at the same time,

4

discourage prisoners from saying, you know, I

5

think this is a serious case, while an

6

objective review, which is what plaintiffs'

7

lawyers do, would suggest that it's not.

8
9

MR. BANNER:

Okay.

But this statute

doesn't -- doesn't create anything close to a

contingent fee regime.

11

say that the plaintiff has to pay some share of

12

the attorney's fees.

13

A -- a portion of the judgment, not exceeding

MR. BANNER:

Except that it's -- it

22

would be an unusual contingent fee arrangement

23

that would range from -- from 25 percent down

24

to nominal, which is why -- I say it's not -­

his reading of the statute -- under his reading

24

of the statute.

25

MR. BANNER:

Right, but that -- I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. BANNER:

Yes, indeed, there is.

The -- the -- before this statute was enacted,

enacted evidently to give prisoners some skin

MR. LEGNER:

Sure.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Let's assume the

19

statute read, without the parenthetical, when

20

it said a portion of the judgment shall be

21

applied to satisfy the amount of attorney's

22

fees awarded against the defendant.

23
24

Would that mean 25 percent absent that

of the judgment.

No, it says a

So it doesn't say all

It -- it doesn't say the

10

judgment shall be applied to satisfy the amount

11

of attorney's fees.

12

If all it said is "a portion of the

13

judgment shall be applied to satisfy the amount

14

of attorney's fees against the defendant," do

15

you think in that, standing alone, the district

16

court would have discretion to give a dollar?

17

MR. LEGNER:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

No, Your Honor.
It's a -- no?

It's a portion of the judgment.

20

MR. LEGNER:

It -- it is technically a

21

portion of the judgment, but it doesn't -- what

22

that does is it reads out the words "to

23

satisfy."

Absolutely, Your Honor.

25 percent, instead of not to exceed

21

That's -­

I'm asking you -­

18

20

No, no.

Right.
-- what's the

difference between the two things?
MR. LEGNER:

The difference between

22

the two things is that, in the statute as

23

written, Congress recognized that there will be

24

circumstances in which the entire fee award

25

will be satisfied by less than 25 percent.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
32
1

In the hypothetical, without that

2

parenthetical, it -- it provides that a portion

3

will be used but for the purpose of satisfying

4

or fulfilling the award.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

Is

6

your view -- let's assume, it's highly

7

unlikely, but it can happen, the -- the

8

attorney's fees are less than 25 percent of the

9

judgment.

10

Who pays under your reading of the

statute as written?

11

MR. LEGNER:

If the attorney's fees

12

are less than 25 percent of the judgment, the

13

prisoner plaintiff pays.

14
15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And the defendant

pays nothing?

16
17

And -­

MR. LEGNER:

In that circumstance,

that's right, Your Honor.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So

19

what is the difference by Congress saying a

20

portion of the judgment, not to exceed

21

25 percent -- why didn't it just say:

22

portion of the judgment (25 percent) shall be

23

applied?

24

exactly the same thing.

25

a

Under your reading, the two mean

MR. LEGNER:

No, Your Honor, because

Heritage Reporting Corporation

33
1

there's circumstances in which, say, 17 percent

2

of the judgment will be sufficient to fulfill

3

the fee award.

4

and a $17,000 fee award, 17 percent of the -­

5

of the judgment will fulfill that fee award.

If there's a $100,000 judgment

That's why -­

away with the "shall apply."

The

But it says "not to

It sounds like it's imagining an

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

award that does exceed, and it says "not to

2

exceed."

3

What happens when it does exceed?

4

Then the defendant picks up the tab.

5

"not to exceed" language would be a strange

6

thing for Congress to put in if it really meant

7

the plaintiff pays 25 percent, and, if the

8

judgment is larger, the defendant pays the

9

rest.

10

MR. LEGNER:

But the

Well, Your Honor, the

11

reason they use "not to exceed" is that there

12

are cases where the plaintiff won't pay

13

25 percent; for instance, where the fee award

14

is equal to 17 percent of the judgment.

15

So, in that circumstance, the -- the

16

fee award will be fulfilled, satisfied, with

17

less than 25 percent of the judgment.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Legner, you put a

19

lot of emphasis on the word "satisfy" and I

20

think in -- in most cases you're right as to

21

what "satisfy" means.

22

I guess the question I have is whether

23

in this context one should think that the word

24

"satisfy" says anything.

25

And -- and my question goes basically

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
36
1

that in many cases, and probably in the vast

2

majority of cases, no part of the judgment,

3

including the full judgment, could possibly

4

satisfy the fee award.

5

So given that we're talking about a

6

circumstance in which in the vast majority of

7

cases the fee award is not going to be

8

satisfied, why should we understand the word

9

"satisfy" in the way that you think we should?

10

MR. LEGNER:

Well, Justice Kagan,

11

because, under our interpretation, there will

12

be some circumstances in which the fee award

13

will be completely satisfied.

14

under our reading of that -­

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Additionally,

Well, I agree with you

16

that there might be some.

17

you know, would Congress have used that -- the

18

word in your sense, knowing that in most cases

19

it wasn't going to be full payment?

20

seems as though when this statute uses the

21

word, given what actually happens in the real

22

world, it meant something more along the lines

23

of contribute to the fee award.

24
25

MR. LEGNER:

But the question is,

It just

I understand, Your Honor,

but -- but a couple points on -- on that.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
37
1

First, the fact that the fee -- that the

2

judgment may not be sufficient to fulfill the

3

award, with the 25 percent cap or otherwise,

4

does not change the definition of the word

5

"satisfy."

6

That, our -- under our reading, the

7

district court is required to use the judgment

8

for the purpose of fulfilling the fee award.

9

The district court may be stopped in

10

circumstances, but that's by virtue of the

11

operation of the 25 percent cap, which is a

12

separate intervening force that impacts the -­

13

the -- the apportionment in -- in that

14

situation.

15

But, furthermore, under -- under

16

Petitioner's reading, which would permit a

17

nominal amount, you know, Petitioner indicated

18

that today, that a one dollar apportionment

19

would be sufficient, that in no way intends to

satisfy under any definition -­

statement by Senator Dole that said that

prisoners need to -- prisoners do not bear the

Well, that's true.

13

MR. LEGNER:

But it didn't say

He said
He didn't say

That's true, Your Honor,

19

but by -- with the discretion limiting

20

provisions of Section e(d), Congress clearly

21

moved away from Section 1988's operation.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, it did, you're

23

right.

24

-- actually, it was exactly what you said.

25

I have the same question that the last

Now, your -- your things in your brief

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

talk -- they say limit costs and put it in the

2

same position as non-incarcerated plaintiff.

3

What non-incarcerated plaintiff?

The

4

first sentence of the statute says:

5

action brought by a prisoner ... in which

6

attorney's fees are authorized under Section

7

1988."

8

"In any

Now, that's fairly strong evidence

9

that they're thinking, since it's right in the

10

statute, the first line, that they're thinking

11

of 1988 plaintiffs.

12

Now, that's -- I'm just saying that I

13

can't get too much out of the language.

14

right, it would have been absolutely clear if

15

they had said, "to help satisfy."

16

would lose.

17

satisfy."

18

But they didn't.

You're

Then you

They said, "to

So we have the language up here about

19

up to, and we have the language down there

20

about satisfy.

21

not certain, but then I do look to the purpose,

22

which is what you're talking about.

23

At that point, I, myself, am

And then, when I see that, the first

24

sentence is put them in the same position as

25

1988 plaintiffs.

Well, that's the only

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
42
1

instance when they're going to get their

2

attorney's fees.

3

have to pay up to 25 percent.

4

But, but, okay?

They will

Now, up to 25 -- now we get into the

5

language.

6

thought was, which I'm addressing the question

7

to, we both have the sentence that he quoted on

8

page 12 of his brief, which would have made a

9

choice.

10

So I get into the puzzle.

We can do this in one of two ways.
We can say:

Prisoner, you always pay

11

25 percent, or we could say:

12

decide, up to 25 percent.

13

My

Which way?

Judge, you

Well, I suddenly had this

14

thought.

If we take the former, given the

15

other provision of the statute which says you

16

have to limit the attorney fees generally to a

17

fair amount given the overall judgment, and

18

these judgments are small, the poor district

19

judge on your interpretation, facing a problem

20

where the thing is small, all the burden is

21

going to throw -- be thrown on the lawyer.

22

It's going to be thrown on the lawyer because

23

he'll have to reduce the whole attorney fee in

24

order to make this prisoner, who suffered a

25

lot, not be penniless or not really be hurt a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
43
1

lot.

See, he wants to help the prisoner.

2
3

Am I -- are you following what I'm
saying?

4

MR. LEGNER:

I am, Your Honor.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

And then -­

6

then the only way to help the prisoner who's

7

gotten such a small award is to reduce the

8

whole attorney's fees.

9

discretionary, there's another way.

But if we make it
You can

10

have a reasonable attorney fee here, a little

11

bit higher, and the prisoner doesn't pay the

12

whole 25 percent.

13

prison guard, the state, that's acted so

14

abominably.

15
16
17

We put some of it on the

Now, I think, which is the choice
there?

They're both reasonable choices.
Then I go to page 12 in his brief, and

18

the preceding language, and I conclude, hey,

19

Congress was on a seesaw here, and they ended

20

up on his side.

21

Now, that's a little complicated, but

22

that's where I am at the moment.

23

want to say?

24

MR. LEGNER:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

What do you

A lot, Your Honor.
All right.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
44
1

(Laughter.)

2

MR. LEGNER:

The -- you're right that

3

the first sentence of Section (d)(1) states

4

that in any situation in where fees would be

5

authorized under Section 1988, but it then

6

continues, that sentence continues, "such fees

7

shall not be awarded, except," and then the

8

provision goes on to restrain the court's

9

discretion in awarding a fee under Section

10
11

1988.
So, in this provision, Congress moved

12

away -- Congress started with Section 1988

13

because these are claims under Section 1988 -­

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MR. LEGNER:

Yeah.

-- but for this specific

16

class of litigant, Congress moved away from the

17

normal operation of Section 1988.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that inclusion

19

-- now -- but, remember, if you follow this

20

complicated argument -­

21

MR. LEGNER:

Sure.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- sorry to be so

23

complicated, but the -- really I've the choice

24

down in my mind.

25

is not the government and it's not the -- the

It's the -- the victim here

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

victim on your interpretation, as I've been

2

through it, it is not -- it is not so much the

3

prisoner, it is not so much the government; it

4

is the lawyer, because -- because, as I said,

5

the -- the -- the prisoner who suffered some,

6

you know, pretty bad treatment and has got a

7

very small award, the judge can help him out

8

only by cutting the whole legal fee.

9

But if the opposite interpretation is

10

right, the judge has another tool.

The other

11

tool is to make the defendants here pay more

12

than 75 percent.

13

The judge has more discretion.

14

with the different cases differently.

15

first they tried the one, rejected it on page

16

12, and now they tried the other.

And so now we have two tools.
He can deal
And

17

Now -- now, that's where I am.

And -­

18

MR. LEGNER:

And -­

Sure, Your Honor.

19

and -- and I would add that the -- the court -­

20

or, I'm sorry, Congress in this provision

21

limited the court's discretion to award

22

attorney's fees in other ways.

23

the total amount of the attorney's fee is

24

capped at 150 percent of the judgment.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

For instance,

Mm-hmm.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
46
1

MR. LEGNER:

So Congress took away

2

discretion and limited the amount of attorney's

3

fees -­

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

MR. LEGNER:

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yeah.

-- in -- in that way.
Well, that seems

7

right, that -- that Congress limited discretion

8

in certain ways.

9

limit discretion in this way?

10

The question is:

MR. LEGNER:

Did it

Yes, Your Honor, that's

11

exactly right.

12

which, if this Court is unclear whether it

13

limited discretion, it can look around to the

14

surrounding provisions and find only situations

15

where Congress did limit discretion, and it's

16

at odds with -­

17

And when we have a provision in

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But that sounds as

18

though we're just going to interpret the

19

statute in a general direction, no matter what.

20

MR. LEGNER:

Your Honor, I think that

21

that contextual argument supports our reading

22

of "satisfy."

23

and foremost, our interpretation is grounded

24

in, and gives effect to, the word "to satisfy."

25

I think that, you know, first

The fact that we read it as

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
47
1

non-discretionary or not discretion-conferring

2

is supported by the surrounding provisions of

3

Section 1988.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you have -- this is

5

the same question that was asked of Mr. Banner.

6

Do you have a way that Congress could have

7

written this statute to clearly state what

8

Mr. Banner thinks it means?

9

better than this?

10

MR. LEGNER:

You know, that's

If Congress wanted to

11

state -- Congress could have used language that

12

it always uses in fee-shifting statutes when it

13

intends to confer discretion on district

14

courts.

15

In those fee-shifting statutes,

16

Congress uses "may" instead of "shall" and

17

states "the court, in its discretion."

18

for instance, the court could have said the

19

district court -- whenever a monetary judgment

20

is entered, the court may, in its discretion,

21

apply -- apply a portion of it to the fee

22

award.

23

And so,

That's what Petitioner's reading means.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Legner, if, as

24

this discussion has gone on, we conclude that

25

this statute is ambiguous -- it could be read

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
48
1

your way, it could be read their way -- then,

2

as Justice Breyer suggested, why shouldn't we

3

take 1988 as the closest, rather than, I think

4

you suggested that, well, then look to the

5

American rule?

6

party bears his or own -- her own counsel fees.

7

Under the American rule, each

MR. LEGNER:

Your -- Your -- Your

8

Honor, in that situation, it's important to

9

understand that Congress explicitly moved away

10

from the operation of Section 1988.

And so it

11

moved away from the broad or wide fee shifting

12

or complete fee shifting under Section 1988 to

13

something else.

14

moved towards the American rule.

And in -- in so moving, it

15

Now, Congress made a compromise.

16

Congress decided that prisoner plaintiffs

17

should be allowed -- be permitted to retain at

18

least 75 percent of their -- of their judgment.

19

But the fact that Congress reached that

20

compromise doesn't mean that we're still really

21

in the background of Section 1988, especially

22

where Congress moved away from the operation of

23

Section 1988 in so many ways.

24
25

For instance, in Section (d)(1),
Congress specified that the amount of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
49
1

attorney's fees shall be "proportionally

2

related" to the relief ordered.

3

completely the opposite of the rule under

4

Section 1988 -­

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

That is

But here's another -­

6

here's another -- I don't know, looking at the

7

dictionary here, and on "satisfy," isn't it the

8

case that the government pays the rest of the

9

reasonable fee, right?

10

MR. LEGNER:

Yes, Your Honor.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

And everybody

12

knows the government pays the rest of it,

13

right?

14

MR. LEGNER:

Yes, Your -­

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So think of a

16

case where it's 12 percent, which you think it

17

can't be, but suppose the judge says,

18

12 percent, you pay 12 percent, okay?

19

Now, they're paying the rest from the

20

government.

He's paying the 12 percent in the

21

circumstances that satisfies the debt.

22

of bankruptcy.

Think of a settlement.

4

MR. LEGNER:

In -- in the first

5

sentence of e(d)(2), the obligation is to

pay -- to fulfill the fee award from the

7

judgment with a capped amount, but this is no

different than circumstances in which Congress

specifies a primary source to be used to

fulfill an obligation and then realizes that

sufficient to fulfill that obligation and then

something else, which is we've made the

15

In fee-shifting statutes that are

clear -- and this is clear, they're shifting

17

maximum discretion.

19

hands.

We don't look to tie their

20

Why do you think that given the fact

21

that some plaintiffs are seriously injured by

22

state defendants, that Congress would have

23

wanted to take away from the district court

24

absolute discretion to ensure that a plaintiff

25

is adequately compensated for the severity of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
54
1

their injury?

2

MR. LEGNER:

Because, Your Honor, in

3

those circumstances where the Congress does

4

confer on the district court absolute or broad

5

discretion, it uses discretion-conferring

6

language such as "may" and "in its discretion."

7

Section 1988(b) itself uses the words

8

"in its discretion" and there's other examples

9

under Section 505 of the Copyright Act or

10

Section 1132(g)(1) of ERISA.

11

provisions, Congress provided that the Court

12

may in its discretion award fees.

13

didn't use those words here.

14

Those -- in those

Congress

What Congress did was it made a

15

choice.

Congress said that there is a lot of

16

prisoner litigation out there, and the

17

government is bearing a huge burden of this.

18

And we are, in particular, concerned about

19

attorney's fees awards.

20

So Congress made a compromise.

21

Congress reached an agreement that will

22

decrease or limit the government's exposure to

23

fee awards, at the same time as treating a -- a

24

prisoner plaintiff more like a civil tort

25

plaintiff.

point, isn't it?
MR. LEGNER:

Well, Your -- Your Honor,

13

the point is that Congress meant to -- Congress

14

clearly departed from the operation of

15

Section 1988 in the other provisions of (d)(1),

16

for instance, when it capped the reasonable

17

hourly rate, put in the requirement -- capped

18

the overall amount of the fee award, and put in

19

the requirement that the fees be proportionally

20

related, Congress signaled -- signaled its

21

intent that the wide discretion under 1988 is

22

not at play here anymore.

23

from that.

24
25

We've moved away

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STUART BANNER

20

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

21

MR. BANNER:

Well, the crux of this is

22

the word "satisfy."

23

the word "satisfy" can bear the weight that

24

Respondents put on it.

25

The question is whether

And so all I want to do is emphasize

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
57
1

how common it is to use the phrase "applied to

2

satisfy" in the way that Justice Kagan

3

suggested to mean not -- not -- not applied to

4

pay completely, but applied in that direction,

5

applied toward satisfying.

6

So, for example, the rental payments

7

on a violin can be applied to satisfy the

8

purchase price if the -- if the student

9

persists in taking lessons.

Obviously, the

10

rental payments aren't going to completely

11

fulfill the purchase price.

12

be applied in that direction.

13

They're going to

Work an attorney does on a pro bono

14

matter can be applied -- the hours can be

15

applied to satisfy the attorney's pro bono

16

obligation, even if it's an hour -- just a

17

couple of hours.

18

those hours are applied to satisfy the pro bono

19

obligation.

20

In ordinary English, we say

Congress uses "applied to satisfy" in

21

this same sense in statutes.

We give an

22

example at page 8 of the -- of the yellow brief

23

involving extra pay for Navy personnel who

24

spend more than 48 hours on a submarine in a

25

month, but the relevant provision in the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
58
1

statute is hours in excess of 48 in a given

2

month may be applied to satisfy the 48-hour

3

requirement in subsequent months, even if they

4

don't completely fulfill the 48-hour

5

requirement in subsequent months.

6

So, in this statute, when Congress

7

used the phrase "applied to satisfy," the most

8

plausible interpretation of it is applied in

9

the direction of satisfying, not applied to -­

10
11

to pay completely.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you have any sense

12

of how many cases up to 25 percent of the

13

judgment actually will be able to satisfy?

14

MR. BANNER:

How often it is that the

15

attorney's fees are less than -- than

16

25 percent?

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, how -- how often

18

it is that the amount, you know, whether it's

19

25 percent of the judgment or some lesser

20

amount, will actually satisfy the amount of

21

fees awarded?

22

MR. BANNER:

Oh, it's extraordinarily

23

rare because -- because, you know, these cases

24

might take hundreds of hours to litigate and

25
