ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLYSON N. HO

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11

MS. HO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

For 400 years, courts have adjudicated

13

disputes between private parties about the

14

validity of patents.

15

transferred this judicial power to an executive

16

branch tribunal that is unusual because of five

17

features.

18

Six years ago, Congress

First, it exercises the judicial

19

power; second, in disputes between private

20

parties; third, over private rights; fourth,

21

without both Article III supervision and

22

consent; and, fifth, about questions

23

adjudicated in courts for 400 years.

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

Ms. Ho, you

outlined your position, but there must be some

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
4
1

means by which the Patent Office can correct

2

the errors that it's made, like missing prior

3

art that would be preclusive.

4
5

So, do you recognize any error
correction mechanism as within Article III?

6

MS. HO:

Yes, certainly, Justice

7

Ginsburg.

8

position is not that the PTO is precluded from

9

error correction.

10
11

And -- and our position -- our

It simply can't do it

through this adjudication.
So, for example, we believe ex parte

12

reexams, which are fundamentally examinational

13

and not adjudicational in nature, are perfectly

14

consistent with Article III.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But your brief

16

wasn't clear on that.

17

difference between reexamination, but you

18

didn't take a position on -- on whether that

19

would be permissible, but now you are?

20

reexamination procedure would be all right?

21
22
23
24
25

MS. HO:

You -- you recognize a

The

Yes, ex -- ex parte

reexaminational -- reexamination -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

What about inter

partes reexamination?
MS. HO:

I think inter partes

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

1

reexamination presents a closer case, but it is

2

still fundamentally examinational.

3

the government brief that we cite on page 13 of

4

our reply, where the government itself draws a

5

line between both ex parte and inter partes

6

reexamination and says these are fundamentally

7

examinational.

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

MS. HO:

10
11
12

I think in

Could you -­

And that distinguishes us -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Could you

review for me what you mean by examinational?
MS. HO:

Certainly.

When we -- when I

13

-- I think what the government means by

14

examinational and what we mean by examinational

15

is that that is fundamentally a proceeding

16

between the Patent and Trade Office, between

17

the government and the Patent Owner, between

18

the private -- the private party.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But it's one,

20

I suppose, in which anybody can participate?

21

In other words, including the person alleging

22

infringement or the person challenging the

23

grant of the patent?

24
25

MS. HO:

Not with respect to -- with

-- with respect to -- I think that's a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

fundamental difference.

2

parte reexam, the only role for the third party

3

is to request, and then at that point, the

4

third party drops out.

5

With respect to ex

Even with respect to inter partes

6

reexam, where Congress gave the third party

7

more -- more participatory rights, the third

8

party bears no burden of production or

9

persuasion.

It is still fundamentally a matter

10

between the PTO and the Patent -­

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But I thought -­
I'm sorry, there

13

is always inherent a burden of -- of -- of

14

production.

15

I think this patent's invalid, period.

16

have to supply them with a reason for doing

17

what they're doing.

18

You can't write the PTO and say:
You

So, why is that reason any different

19

than actively participating and pointing the

20

PTO in the right direction?

21

fundamentally Article III that changes this

22

process into an Article III violation?

23

MS. HO:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

What is so

Certainly, Justice -­
Both of them are

just informing the PTO of the nature of its

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

error and giving it an opportunity to correct

2

its error.

3

MS. HO:

I think the fundamental

4

difference -- which is that I think the -- why

5

the -- the government itself has referred to

6

inter partes reexam as -- as adjudicational, is

7

it is -- it is initiated by the third party and

8

the third party actually prosecutes that

9

proceeding.

10
11

It is deciding a cause between the
patent owner -­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, not quite,

13

because under the rules, if the third party

14

settles with the patent owner, the PTO can

15

still continue the action, can still decide the

16

question, can still participate on appeal.

17

So it is a public issue that is being

18

litigated or discussed or adjudicated, so isn't

19

that quite different than a normal

20

adjudication?

21

MS. HO:

I -- I don't believe so, Your

22

Honor.

And -- and -- and let me -- let me push

23

back a little bit on -- on when you say that -­

24

that the -- the PTO may -- may continue to

25

conduct the proceedings.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
8
1

Both the statute and the regulations

2

provide that the PTAB may dismiss the case,

3

which its public guidance says is -- is its

4

preference, or it may proceed to final written

5

decision.

6

And we've located only four instances

7

where the PTAB, even after settlement, has

8

proceeded to final written decision.

9

every case, it has informed the parties that it

10

has already decided the case.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And in

So -­

But in -- in your

12

-- in your brief, you said if the parties

13

settle, the PTO can't go on.

14

15

MS. HO:

That was -- that

Well, I believe what we did

16

was we -- we -- we quoted the statute, which

17

says it -- it can -- its preference is to

18

settle, or it may proceed -- it may proceed to

19

final written -- written decision.

20

And we've -- again, we've located only

21

four times when the PTO has -- PTAB has done

25

And, again, it's already reached its

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If this is a

private right, as you claim, what does it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

matter in terms of whether the process is

2

adjudicatory or not?

3

If I own something, which is what your

4

basic position, I understand, is, that this is

5

a personal right, how can a government agency

6

take that right away without due process of law

7

at all?

8

III, that only a court can adjudicate that

9

issue?

Isn't that the whole idea of Article

10

MS. HO:

I think I would say, Justice

11

Sotomayor, your -- it -- in terms of -- of

12

matters that have been adjudicated

13

traditionally in courts, over -- between

14

private parties over -- over private rights, I

15

think this Court's cases have established a

16

baseline where those matters -- Article III

17

vests those matters in Article III courts.

18

At the same time, this Court's cases

19

have recognized narrow exceptions, where public

20

rights, as distinct from private rights, are at

21

issue, where Article III does not require that

22

those rights be vested, the decisions of those

23

rights -­

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Just to examine

public rights, could Congress say -- let's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

hypothesize going forward -- that we will grant

2

you a patent on the condition that you agree to

3

this procedure; otherwise, we don't give you

4

the patent.

5

Could Congress do that?

MS. HO:

No, for -- for two reasons.

6

First, we believe that would be an

7

unconstitutional condition, so that Congress

8

cannot condition the exercise of a right or a

9

property or benefit of -- of any sort, to the

10

extent that doing so would -- would conflict

11

with another article of the -- of the

12

Constitution.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

MS. HO:

15
16

So, for example -- yes, Your

Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17

case for that?

18

doesn't quite work.

19

What -­

What's your closest

Not Crowell versus Benson, that

MS. HO:

I think -- I think, perhaps

20

-- I think, perhaps our -- our closest case to

21

that might be Northern Pipeline or maybe one of

22

the bankruptcy cases -­

MS. HO:

I -­

-- where even -- even -- even

the fact that Congress had recognized -- had

Heritage Reporting Corporation

said that it's permissible for -- for these

2

rights to be adjudicated in an Article III

3

court.

4

Article III prevented the -- those

5

adjudications may not -­

6

This Court still, in Stern, held that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but Congress

7

didn't create the right in Stern, so that's

8

quite distinguished.

9

Let me ask you this, it's a basic

10

question -- patent lawyers would probably know

11

the answer.

12

reducing the life of all patents by 10 years?

13

Could Congress say that we are

MS. HO:

Yes, I think that would -­

14

that -- that goes to the limited times

15

requirement in Congress that this Court doesn't

16

--

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, then that -­

18

doesn't that show that the patent owner has

19

limited expectations as to the scope and the

20

validity of the property right that he holds?

21

MS. HO:

No, Your Honor, I don't -- I

22

don't think the limited times requirement,

23

which is the Article I, Section 8 requirement,

24

I don't think that goes to whether Congress

25

could, by statute, withdraw the adjudication of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1

disputes that have been adjudicated in courts

2

for centuries, could withdraw those cases and

3

put them in a non-Article III tribunal.

4

Again -­

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What is -­

6

what is the relationship between your position

7

and the takings clause?

8

certainly diminish the value of your property

9

rights quite extensively when it comes up with

10
11

The government can

new -- new regulation.
You have a lot that you think you

12

could have built a mansion on, and then the

13

government passes a law and you can only build

14

a shed on it and -- and yet we often say -- or

15

give the government a lot of leeway in saying

16

that -- that they don't have to pay

17

compensation.

18

So, if the government can restrict

19

your property right in real property to that

20

extent, why can't it do so with respect to

21

patent rights?

22

MS. HO:

And I think the fundamental

23

difference there, Mr. Chief Justice, in terms

24

of -- of -- of takings and due process, which

25

we haven't advanced arguments about, and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1

Article III, which is really focused on the

2

exercise of the judicial power, and it has

3

really two components.

4

It has the component that is directed

5

toward the individual rights guarantee, so the

6

guarantee of litigants to impartial

7

decision-makers and at the same time at the

8

structural protections, the checks and balances

9

protections that protect the -- the judicial

10
11

integrity.
So I think the difference here is that

12

when Congress -- and certainly individual

13

rights are at stake when the government takes

14

property that belongs to one person for a

15

public use and doesn't pay just compensation.

16

But I think, in the Article III

17

context, where Congress is taking a category of

18

cases that have been adjudicated in courts for

19

centuries and removes those cases -- withdraws

20

those cases to a non-Article III tribunal, that

21

impacts not only the individual rights

22

guarantees that Article III does -­

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But for a very

24

limited purpose, for the purpose of determining

25

whether -- it's not a duplication of an

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

infringement action.

2

kind of reexamination that the -- it's only for

3

the prior art, right?

4

restrictions.

5

It's -- it's a narrow

And there are other

So it's -- it's not -- it is geared to

6

be an error correction mechanism and not a

7

substitute for litigation.

8

MS. HO:

9

Several points to that, that

-- Justice Ginsburg, you're absolutely correct

10

that the grounds are under sections 102 and 103

11

novelty and non-obviousness with respect to

12

prior art.

13

Even if that were narrow, I think this

14

Court has said that it's no more permissible

15

for Congress to -- to kind of nibble around the

16

edges, as opposed to a wholesale transfer, but

17

even so, here, setting aside that those two

18

areas of novelty and obviousness make up about

19

60 percent of the patent validity challenges in

20

the district courts, the estoppel provisions

21

provide that, in the 80 percent of cases, in

22

80 percent of inter partes reviews, those

23

proceedings are taking place with concurrent

24

district court litigation.

25

So, if in those cases, if in the IPR

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

the patent holder wins, then the -- the claims

2

of the patent are canceled and the patent -­

3

the challenger goes into the district court and

4

says the action is moot -- the infringement

5

action is moot.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So -- I'm sorry.
Ms. -- Ms. Ho, we

8

have a number of cases that have arguably

9

addressed this issue already, like McCormick,

10

for example, in which this Court said the only

11

authority competent to set a patent aside or to

12

annul it or to correct it for any reason

13

whatever is vested in the courts of the United

14

States.

15

another one.

16

Justice Story indicating that any correction to

17

a patent has to go to a court.

18

We have cases -- and American Bell is
We have that wonderful quote from

The United States takes the position,

19

as I understand it, that some of those

20

decisions are purely statutory interpretation.

21

What's your reading of those cases?

22

MS. HO:

So our reading of those

23

cases, particularly McCormick, is they are

24

constitutional.

25

that far for us -- us to prevail.

We don't need this Court to go
It's enough

Heritage Reporting Corporation

in this case for the Court to hold -­

2

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Why is your reading

3

that they're constitutional, if you could help

4

me with that?

5

MS. HO:

Certainly.

We believe -- we

6

believe they're constitutional in McCormick

7

because this Court wasn't -- didn't reach that

8

decision sort of in the absence of statutory

9

authority, but in the face of it.

10

There was, at that time, statutory

11

authority in a different procedure, albeit, for

12

the -­

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Ms. Ho, I'm sorry,

14

I thought in McCormick, that -- why did the

15

Court even bother looking at the statute?

16

it did, I understood, was look at the statute

17

and say the statute basically defines the issue

18

of a new patent being issued as one -- before

19

the old patent expires.

20

What

And so they were really doing a

21

statutory analysis of whether or not, by that

22

process, the old patent was expired, and they

23

were saying, no, if you want it to expire now,

24

you have to go to court, because there's no

25

statutory authority for doing it currently.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17

2

So I'm not quite sure how -- how you
get to the constitutional holding.

3

MS. HO:

I -- I think how we -- how we

4

get to the constitutional holding, Your Honor,

5

is that there was, at that time, there -- there

6

-- there was another statute in play that would

7

have -- would have permitted the -- the -- the

8

-- the cancellation.

9

that the Court -- there wasn't any statutory

10

authority.

11

holding.

12

So it wasn't -- it's not

It wasn't simply a statutory

It's certainly true that the Court

13

didn't refer to Article -- Article III.

14

didn't -- didn't refer to that.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It

It's certainly

16

true that it didn't refer to that other statute

17

either.

MS. HO:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MS. HO:

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Ho -­

Yes, Your Honor.
-- can I -- can I take

22

you back to this question of where you would

23

draw the line -­

MS. HO:

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.
-- between ex parte

Heritage Reporting Corporation

and inter partes reexamination on the one hand

and this?

3

would permit, those proceedings too can be

4

initiated by a third party -- you know, can be

5

at the request of a third party, and -- and

6

those -- in those proceedings too, the third

7

party can participate in some way, can file a

8

reply to the patentee's statement, can make

9

known its views.

10

Because, as I understand what you

So what's the line?

Where would you

11

-- what are the procedures that are here that

12

you think make this essentially adjudicatory

13

that are not in those other proceedings?

14

MS. HO:

Certainly.

I think how we -­

15

we would define an adjudication as it's where a

16

tribunal is hearing and deciding a cause

17

between two private -- two private parties.

18

So in -- in -- in both IP reexam and

19

ex parte reexam, as Your -- as Your Honor said,

20

the third party essentially falls out after

21

making the request, is able to comment.

you have here is -- is trial -- is trial-like.

18

MS. HO:

I think -- I think,

19

fundamentally, an adjudication, an exercise of

20

the judicial power -- and one reason we know it

21

in this case is because it simply has taken a

22

category of cases out and put it into the

23

tribunal, but I think hearing and deciding a

24

cause between two private parties that results

25

-- that results in a -- in a final binding

judgment.

only get the private property if, in fact, you

survive the provisions of the title, of which

this is one.

And, in addition to that, I thought

24

it's the most common thing in the world that

adjudicatory-type procedures often involving

2

private parties.

So what's special about this

4

MS. HO:

To -­

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- or do you want to

6

say it isn't special and all the agency

7

proceedings are unlawful?

8

MS. HO:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

It -­
Because a lot of them

10

would fit the definition, I think, that you

11

propose.

12

MS. HO:

Let me -- let me -- let me

13

begin with -- with your last -- your last

14

question, Justice Breyer.

15

I don't think that invalidating IPR

16

would affect these, for the fundamental reason

17

that in virtually -- virtually all truly

18

administrative adjudications, those are between

19

the government as -- as -- as the enforcer.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

You could have -- is

21

an airline the government?

22

company the government?

23

electricity company or a natural gas company,

24

the government?

25

MS. HO:

Is a trucking

Is a utility,

In the vast -- in the vast

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
22
1

majority of administrative adjudications, it is

2

-- it is the government, or those proceedings

3

are acting as a permissible adjunct to the

4

district court.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, one

6

understanding of this, Ms. Ho, is that this is

7

the government in a real sense.

8

government trying to figure out whether it made

9

a mistake by granting the patent, which the

It's the

10

government sometimes does and knows it

11

sometimes does, but the government wants to put

12

in place a set of procedures that will actually

13

increase the government's accuracy in figuring

14

out whether it made a mistake.

15

And that involves listening to a third

16

party that has some interest in the proceeding.

17

So it seems a little bit odd to say, sure, the

18

government can reexamine this, the government

19

can allow a third party to request it, can

20

allow the third party to do some things, but

21

there's some line that falls short of what the

22

government thinks are the procedures that

23

enable the greatest accuracy.

24

So why -- why would we do that?

25

MS. HO:

Certainly, Your Honor.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And I

Official
23
1

think to be clear, we're not -- we're certainly

2

not contesting the proposition that adversarial

3

testing can't be a very beneficial proceeding

4

for arriving at the truth.

5

But it -- it's useful and it's helpful

6

when Article III protections -- if it's an

7

adjudication between private parties over

8

private rights, adversarial testing also

9

requires Article III protections, a neutral

10

decision-maker, not subject to -- to the -- to

11

the -- to having to curry favor with the

12

executive, which is the situation that -- that

13

we have here.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

15

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, to ask you -­
Why not -- why not,

16

though, Ms. Ho, just simply say the question is

17

whether there's a private right involved?

18

answering Justice Kagan's questions and Justice

19

Breyer's questions, you struggled with how much

20

of an adjudication does an inquisitorial

21

process have to have before it becomes an

22

adjudication.

23

In

Why does that matter at all?

If -- if you really want to stake your

24

ground and think McCormick's right, why not

25

just say anytime a private right is taken by

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
24
1

anyone, it has to be through an Article III

2

forum?

3

MS. HO:

In large measure, Justice

4

Gorsuch, because of several -- in several of

5

this Court's cases, in Schor, for example,

6

in Providence -­

7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Schor is about the

8

line between public and private rights.

9

can stake your ground and simply say this is a

10

You

private right.

11

MS. HO:

We certainly do stake our

12

ground on that it's a private right.

13

this Court held -- has held as much already in

14

Horne.

15
16
17

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

We think

But then you -- but

then you -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, suppose -­

18

suppose that Congress had included inter partes

19

review in the Patent Act of 1790.

20

make -- would you make the same argument?

21

Would you still say it's a private right?

22

MS. HO:

Would you

Yes, we would, because even

23

in -- even in -- in 1790, Your Honor, there

24

would still be a 200-year history of these

25

rights being adjudicated in -- in courts -- in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
25
1

courts at all.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

But you think Congress

3

was under an obligation to create the patent

system, a constitutional obligation to do it?

5

MS. HO:

No, we don't.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

So could it do it

subject to the -- grant these monopolies,

8

subject to this limitation?

MS. HO:

I think there are any number

10

of ways that Congress could certainly

11

permissibly condition a grant on -- of a

12

patent.

unconstitutional condition on it, either under

14

takings or due process or Article III.

15

What it can't do is exert an

your position that somehow at the founding in

Crown and the Privy Council sidestepping -­

19

sidestepping any judicial adjudication of

20

validity, that in 1789 the founders intended to

21

change that system as radically as to say, no,

22

we're not going to permit either the

23

legislature -- the legislature to change the

24

terms of a patent grant?

25

MS. HO:

The way I would respond, Your

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
26

Honor, I think with respect to the history, I

2

think the history here is very strong that at

3

-- certainly, at the time of the founding and

4

for centuries before, that English courts at

law, this was precisely -- this wasn't just the

6

stuff that was decided in the -- in the courts

7

at Westminster in 1789 were those proceedings.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Your amici -- your

strongest amici says that it had waned, the

10

Privy Council's adjudications had waned over

11

time and that they could only find 10 times

12

over a 20-year period preceding 1789 in which

13

the Privy Council had acted.

14

it waned didn't mean it was eliminated, and it

15

didn't mean that the Privy Council or the Crown

16

thought that it no longer had those rights.

MS. HO:

But the fact that

Respectfully, Your Honor, I

18

believe that it did.

The -- the Privy Council

19

revoked its last patent in -- in any -- any

20

case, ordinary or otherwise, in -- in 1779.

21

And that was only after -- it was a national

Council had told the patent holder that the

MS. HO:

Well, the statute of

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER M. KISE
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT GREENE'S ENERGY GROUP, LLC
MR. KISE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
IPR, inter partes review, comports

21

with both Article III and the Seventh Amendment

22

for at least the following three reasons:

23

First, inter partes review simply reexamines

24

the propriety of the original grant of a

25

patent, engaging in the same type of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
29
1

patentability analysis entrusted by Congress to

2

the executive since 1790.

3

The process itself is not inherently

4

judicial, and it does not involve the exercise

5

of the judicial power.

6

Next, inter partes review does not

7

extinguish, in the language of the question

8

presented, private property rights.

9

extent standards of patentability were not met

To the

10

initially, the patent simply should not have

11

issued.

12

And, finally, although we don't

13

believe, respectfully, the Court need reach

14

this question, inter partes review satisfies

15

any test under any of the courts' public law

16

cases.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

You at some point -­

18

I mean, what I've wondered as I've read this is

19

-- suppose that just what you say happens, with

20

that all we're doing is reexamining the patent

21

and the statute provides it, but suppose that

22

the patent has been in existence without

23

anybody reexamining it for 10 years and,

24

moreover, the company's invested $40 billion in

25

developing it.

And then suddenly somebody

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
30
1

comes in and says:

2

reexamined, not in court but by the Patent

3

Office.

4
5

Now, that seems perhaps that it would
be a problem or not?

Oh, oh, we -- we want it

MR. KISE:

I -- I don't think so,

respectfully, Justice Breyer, and here's why.

I don't know that the

timeline -­

Well -­
-- some lasted a long

time.

17

MR. KISE:

Respectfully, I don't think

18

that it -- it matters, certainly not

19

constitutionally, but -- but -- but even in the

20

structure of the -- of the patent statute -­

21

the patent scheme that's been created by

22

Congress.

23

Congress established certain

24

patentability criteria that need be met, and

25

all patents are taken -­

Everybody's dead, by

except this one guy who happens to be sued for

infringement.

MR. KISE:

All patents are taken

subject to these patentability standards.
JUSTICE BREYER:

saying can it be anything?

at all where you're going to re -- do people

sufficiently so that it now becomes what?

Is there something in

long period of time and much reliance from a

different question.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

MR. KISE:

Yes.

Then you would

Well, I -- I don't know

determination that's being made by the

your position, it strikes me, is simply that

you've got to take the bitter that the

government might reevaluate it at some

subsequent point.

Justice.

I'm thinking of the public employment cases,

3

the welfare benefits cases.

you cannot put someone in that position.

5

cannot say, if you take public employment, we

6

can terminate you in a way that's inconsistent

with due process.

MR. KISE:

We've said you -­
You

I -- I don't think,

respectfully, Mr. Chief Justice, this is

10

inconsistent with due process.

11

that the scheme itself is set up so that these

12

rights are taken subject to the power of

13

Congress to determine patentability.

14

I mean -­

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I also think

What about -­

16

in terms of due process anyway, what about this

17

business -- and maybe it's in the Petitioner's

18

brief, that the commissioner can change the -­

19

the panels if she doesn't agree with the

20

direction they're going, that she can add new

21

judges to the panel so that they'll -- in other

22

words, it's a -- the panel itself -- and I

think constitutionally this may be fine, is -­

24

is a tool of the executive activity, rather

25

than something involving some -- anything

resembling a determination of rights?
MR. KISE:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice,

mentioned by Petitioner in the briefs, I don't

believe -- and -- and I'll leave it to the

6

shenanigans point, if you will, that the

17

Administrative Procedures Act and other

18

provisions of the Constitution would deal with

19

infirmities in a particular case on an

20

as-applied basis, but I don't think that the -­

21

the potential for there to be mischief afoot -­

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That -- that was

23

what troubled me deeply about you telling

24

Justice Kagan that, without judicial review,

25

that this would be adequate.

I mean, for me,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

this -- what saves this, even a patent

2

invalidity finding, can be appealed to a court.

3

There's deference with respect to

4

factual matters, but there is de novo review as

5

to legal matters.

6

the -- the Crown, the executive, the PTO, here

7

has unfettered discretion to take away that

8

which it's granted?

25

This isn't like an adjunct to the

I -- I -- I saw an argument that this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

stands alone, fine, in the executive branch and

that there's, in fact, a self-executing

with the results?

begging about what's a private right?

that the very question this Court has to

decide?

MR. KISE:

Respectfully, as I began, I

don't believe that the Court does need to

decide it because this is an executive

adjudication, but to the extent the Court looks

16

to those factors, I think under -- under almost

any test the Court has established, we -- we

have a right that derives solely from and

depends solely on a federal statute.

There are no common law antecedents.

21

Mr. Stewart.

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENT
MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

22

Petitioner and some of the questions

23

from this Court have identified two potential

24

challenges to the inter partes review

25

procedure.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
42
1

The first is that this can't be done

2

by executive branch officials because the

3

effect of patent cancellation is to take away a

4

private property interest.

5

The second -- and this is Petitioner's

6

argument -- is that this can't be done in the

7

way that it's being done because the PTAB is

8

using adversarial procedures.

of the scheme that the patent could be

agency but at least by a court at any time

determine whether the patentee was qualified

there anything you want to say about those?

MR. STEWART:

Now, is

Let -- let me address

those in turn.

As to the first one, the idea

does the patentee have some expectation that

the patent can't be taken away in this manner

because IPR didn't exist when this particular

patent was granted?

20

in court and sometimes administratively,

patents could be reexamined so long as they

remained in force to see whether they complied

23

with the initial conditions of patentability.

This is not a case in which Congress has

changed the substantive rules.

existed as of 1981, correct?

reissuance of patents, in connection with

17

referring to more was the situation where in an

interference, the true inventor would -- or the

putatively true inventor would say this person

shouldn't have gotten the patent because I

21

actually invented it first.

22

But to your -- return to -- to your

23

question, Justice Breyer, and -- and I'd like

to -- to go back to the hypothetical about

public employment, the -- the individual who is

cause protection, has due process rights, has

more effective ways of monitoring its employees

and is better able to detect employees who have

committed acts that would trigger termination

factors that you consider.

predictive test when you're talking about

something like a property right?

25

And I'm

In other words, as Justice Breyer

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
55

mentioned, people invest in their patents to

2

the tunes of billions of dollars in building

3

the plant that's going to make the product

4

that's -- and all that, and yet when you're

5

deciding -- when they're deciding is this a

6

right that I can securely rely on, they've got

7

to go through these five factors, you know, any

8

one of which can be determinative in a

9

particular case.

10

MR. STEWART:

I guess the -- the first

11

thing I would say about cases like Schor and

12

Stern versus Marshall and Northern Pipeline is

13

that they are really directed at a different

14

sort of problem.

15

canonic -- canonical cases, the adjudicator was

16

being asked to determine whether one party was

17

liable to another for a violation of law.

In -- in each of those

And in each case, the -- the

19

adjudicator was being asked to impose a money

21

person to pay money to another, and that's kind

of a classic judicial function.

performed by non-Article III federal

adjudicators as well?

And the answer was

been huge investment?

9

after being sued for infringement.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

11

Stewart, is judicial review here?

12

would you concede that there's a constitutional

13

problem, either if there's no judicial review

14

at all or if the judicial review were

15

deferential as to matters of law?

16

MR. STEWART:

How important, Mr.

I -- I wouldn't -- I

17

would concede that it would be a constitutional

18

concern.

19

III concern.

20

concern, that the person was being divested of

21

property, potentially, without due process of

22

law.

23

I don't think it would be an Article
I think it would be a due process

So I -- I'm very happy that we have

24

judicial review.

I would like to say something

25

about the standard of review there because I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
59
1

think it's important.

2

As -- as your question points out, the

3

-- the cancellation is not going to deprive the

4

courts of any role in determining whether the

5

patent was actually valid.

6

cancellation is simply going to be that the

7

court will defer to the agency under a

8

substantial evidence standard on questions of

9

fact and will review legal issues de novo.

10

The effect of the

And that's a less favorable standard

11

of review for the patentee than would be

12

applied in district court infringement

13

litigation, where the defendant would have to

14

prove invalidity by clear and convincing

15

evidence.

16

But our view is that's a feature and

17

not a bug of the system.

That is, we want a

18

standard of review that will take into account

19

what the agency actually thinks.

20

justification for the clear and convincing

21

evidence standard is the agency is on record,

22

having issued the patent, as thinking that the

23

patent is valid, and, therefore, the -- the

24

court should be not entirely unwilling but

25

reluctant to set that aside, absent clear and

The

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
60

2

convincing evidence.
If -- if we can find out that, no, the

3

PTO's current informed view is that the patent

4

is valid, then it's entirely appropriate to

5

have a standard of review that -- that takes

6

that into account.

7

about cases like Stern versus Marshall is those

are cases that -- that the jurisdiction, the

9

work of the federal courts is not defined in

10

terms of legal issues that they can resolve.

is a case that's kind of the classic work of

question of when is it okay to allow

19

non-Article III federal officials to do that?

20

You don't really need to get to that

And so this Court has

21

question because, here, nobody is asking to

22

hold Petitioner liable.

23

cancellation is not the Petitioner has to pay

24

money damages.

The effect of a

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, in your

judgment, could Congress permit the PTO to

2

adjudicate infringement actions?

3

MR. STEWART:

I think that would be

4

much more difficult for two reasons -- much

5

more constitutionally problematic.

6

would be an infringement action is a classic

7

instance of one party attempting to hold

8

another party liable.

9

The first

And the ordinary relief at the end of

10

a successful infringement action is money

11

damages.

12

more out of its usual bailiwick and much more

13

into the business that is usually performed by

14

courts.

And so that would get the PTO much

15

And the second is there's no

16

historical tradition of non-Article III federal

17

adjudication.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

historical tradition here, except the

20

interference actions, up until 1981, of the PTO

21

canceling issued patents.

22

MR. STEWART:

Well, there's no

I guess 1980 is still -­

23

it's almost 40 years ago, and -- and I do think

24

it's important to point out -- it's an obvious

25

fact, but it's still important to -- to note

Heritage Reporting Corporation

that the PTO is very supportive of IPR, but

2

it's not something the agency came up with on

3

its own.

4

entitled to judicial respect.

5

This is an act of Congress.

It's

Evidently, Congress up until 1980

6

believed that the patent system could function

7

adequately with only sporadic opportunities for

8

administrative reconsideration of issued

9

patents, but during the years since 1980,

10

Congress has made a different judgment.

11

could have tried to beef up the initial

12

examination process.

13

It

It decided that the more efficient

14

way, both from the standpoint of patentees as a

15

group and -- and for the public, the more

16

efficient way was to use post-grant examination

17

procedures that could target the particular

18

patents that both were of questionable validity

19

and were of sufficient commercial importance

20

to -- to prompt a motivated -­

21

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But, Mr. Stewart, if

22

I understand your answer, an infringement

23

action could be adjudicated by the director so

24

long as money damages were not sought, and that

25

would be fine.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. STEWART:

Well -­

2

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So a declaration of

3

non-infringement could be issued by the

4

director, for example, right?

5

MR. STEWART:

And -- and it would be

6

-- that -- even that would be harder to defend

because infringe -- determining whether one

private party's action infringes an existing

patent is not part of the PTO's traditional

work.

MR. STEWART:

Well, I mean, since

19

1836, the PTO and its patent -- and its

20

predecessor, the Patent Office, have decided

21

whether patents should be granted.

22

determined what, in effect, are questions of

23

validity.

24

prerequisites for the -- the granting of the

patent?

They have

Does this person meet the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

The last thing I wanted to say, to -­

2

to respond briefly to Petitioner's primary

3

theory, which is that it's the use of

4

adjudicative proceedings, proceedings that look

5

like a trial that renders this infirm.

6

happens all the time that executive branch

7

agencies get input from private people before

8

making their decisions.

It

9

We've cited formal rule-making as an

10

example, which in rule-making, of course, can

11

be triggered by a petition from a private

12

party.

13

of Congress will listen to sworn testimony from

14

witnesses who may express different views, and

15

Congress ultimately decides how to vote.

16

At congressional hearings, the members

When the Solicitor General is deciding

17

whether to file an amicus brief, we will read

18

the papers that were submitted to this Court.

19

We'll have meetings with the parties that

20

resemble oral arguments.

21

At the end of the day, what makes it

22

unproblematic is that, even though our

23

procedures may resemble the Court's procedures,

24

the decision that we make is the decision to

25

file an amicus brief on behalf of the United

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
65

States.

So long as that's an appropriate

2

exercise of executive branch authority, the

3

fact that we get input from private parties

4

can't render it constitutionally infirm.

If there are no further questions.

MR. STEWART:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

Thank you,

Thank you.
Ms. Ho, four

minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALLYSON N. HO

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

13

MS. HO:

Thank you, Your Honor.

14

Three quick points.

First, the

15

government has conceded that at least some

16

constitutional rights, I believe due process,

17

cannot be suspended as conditions or subject

18

to, and in our view, Article III is no

19

different.

20

Second, with respect to the colloquy

21

about panel stacking, Article III entitles

22

litigants not to have to worry about precisely

23

that sort of executive influence.

24

exactly what this Court -- as this Court put it

25

in Stern, as not to have decision-makers in

That is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
66
1

positions of having to curry favor with the -­

2

with the executive.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

obvious due process flaw?

5

MS. HO:

Wouldn't that be an

I -- I would have thought in

6

a case where it happens, it would have been an

7

obvious due process flaw.

8

cases like ours where it doesn't happen, every

9

-- every administrative judge of the 200 knows

I think even in

10

that this is something that can happen, that

11

the director, and the director has said, and I

12

quote, that she justifies it, she justified it

13

to exercise -- to make sure her policies, her

14

preferred policies are enforced.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I think the

16

government has conceded that due process has to

17

be a check on administrative agency

18

adjudications as well as court adjudications.

19

MS. HO:

And we certainly -- we

20

certainly don't disagree with that, Justice

21

Ginsburg.

22

it, the existence of the panel stacking shows

23

precisely the danger of judges, of

24

decision-makers, who are subject to executive

25

political influence.

Our point is that the existence of

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They're the same

4

people that -- that grant the patent in the

5

first place.

6

Courts don't grant patents.

7

They're executive officials.

MS. HO:

No.

And certainly there is

8

actually -- it is the -- the patent examiners

9

who -- who make the decision to issue.

PTAB

10

judges are not -- are not examiners.

11

the -- they are the -- the patent -- the patent

12

judges.

13

They are

And with respect to -- to waiver, we

14

know what is required to waive Article III

15

protections, as this Court made clear in

16

Wellness.

17

It is knowing and voluntary consent by

18

both parties, which is absent here.

19

Article III supervision, which this Court said

20

in Stern and Atlas Roofing is not satisfied by

21

what this Court called ordinary appeal, which

22

is all that the statute provides litigants in

23

our situation.

24
25

It is

And I guess finally I would say, in
response to the government's argument, you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
68

know, this doesn't just -- IPR doesn't just

2

look like a trial.

3

and determines a cause between two private

4

parties that results in a final enforceable

5

judgment.

6

It is a trial.

It hears

Our objection is not to the use of

7

third parties in any number of government

8

proceedings, any more than we would object to a

9

concerned citizen who calls the police to

10
11

report a crime.
Our objection is to the exercise of

12

the judicial power by an executive branch

13

tribunal in violation of Article III.

14

If there are no further questions.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

I guess the Federal

16

Communications Commission, at least as they

17

used to have it, where a citizen could come in

18

and say I want you to take away the franchise

19

of KPIX, sounds to me as if you've described it

20

perfectly.

21

unconstitutional, too?

22

I guess that would be

MS. HO:

No, Your Honor.

And, in

23

fact, again, in any number -- in the NLRB, in

24

the -- the FTC, the SEC, the CFPB, in all of

25

these agencies what ends up happening is that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
69
1

the government makes the decision to prosecute

2

the action, to prosecute the complaint.

3

It is the government.

That is -- that

4

is pure executive action.

And under -- under

5

our -- our argument against IPR, none of that

6

would be affected whatsoever by invalidating

7

IPR.

8

Thank you, Your Honor.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

10

Well, if I could just

-­

11

MS. HO:

Oh, yes.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- I mean, because

13

there are formal adjudications all over the

14

place in agencies.

15

NLRB runs by formal adjudications and, indeed,

16

when they try to make rules, Congress slaps

17

them down and says we want adjudications.

I mean, for example, the

18

So how is that different?

19

MS. HO:

20

Certainly, Your Honor.

May I

--

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

MS. HO:

Go ahead.

I think the big difference

23

there is at the NLRB, it is the general

24

counsel, it is the general counsel of the NLRB,

25

it is the government, that is bringing that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
70
1

action and that is prosecuting that action.

2

So you're -- you're right there.

3

There -- I think there is some confusion in

4

terms of adjudication for rule-making purposes,

5

which is the government prosecuting the action

6

and choosing that, in opposed to rule-making,

7

which we're not challenging.

8
9

Our challenge is to an adjudication in
the Article III sense between two private

10

parties, where the government isn't -- isn't

11

engaging in the classic executive action of

12

bringing the action or prosecuting action but

13

is adjudicating, is the decider of the action.
