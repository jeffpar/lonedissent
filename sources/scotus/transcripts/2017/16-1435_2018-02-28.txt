ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. DAVID BREEMER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. BREEMER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

Minnesota's statute bans all

12

conventional political expression on apparel to

13

prevent a smaller class of material that can

14

already be regulated under other election

15

statutes.

16

Commerce, Moveon.cor -- Moveon.org, excuse me

17

-- and countless other examples are prohibited.

18

Since a vast amount of the banned material is

19

legitimate speech and the statute has plain -­

20

a few plainly justified applications, it is

21

overbroad and unconstitutional -­

examples you gave, in your view, could be

MR. BREEMER:

narrowly drawn?

MR. BREEMER:

No, I do not think they

statute on its face violates the First

12

The as-applied claims

So the only question is whether this

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And it does

Do you -- do you

13

think, Mr. Breemer, that a statute could target

14

only electoral speech, in other words, "Clinton

15

for President," "Trump for President," that

16

sort of thing?

17

speech cannot be worn in the polling place?

18

MR. BREEMER:

19

that.

20

statute -­

21

Could a statute say that that

Yes, a statute does say

In Minnesota, the first sentence of this

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, I know.

But it -­

22

could a statute constitutionally say that?

23

it were limited to that, would that be

24

permissible, or is it impermissible?

25

MR. BREEMER:

If

Yes, Your Honor, it's a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
6
1

very close call, but it's not one that this

2

Court has to make in this particular case.

3
4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I know, but I'm just

asking your view.

5

MR. BREEMER:

I honestly don't know,

6

Your Honor, whether that -- that line is so

7

close, but the statute here, the first

8

sentence, already prohibits that material, and

9

it's unchallenged, that particular sentence

10

here.

And even assuming you could ban advocacy

11

expression, this statute goes so far to take in

12

so much material that isn't advocacy, that is

13

simply self-expression of personal values and

14

associations.

15

very tough call, but it's not one this Court

16

has to decide.

17

So I agree it's a tough -- a

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but it -- but

18

it's important for us if -- we're going to have

19

to write an opinion on this.

20

don't know, I don't know.

21

(Laughter.)

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

23

You say, well, I

What about political

buttons?

24

MR. BREEMER:

Anything that -­

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

"Vote -- Vote for X"

Heritage Reporting Corporation

or "Vote for Y" and they're both on the ballot.

2

MR. BREEMER:

Correct.

As I mentioned

3

before, the statute -- the first sentence

4

already bans that, and so I think -­

We're asking about a

6

hypothetical case.

limited to that be upheld?

constitutional in your view?

No, I don't think it

I don't think it would be.

11

MR. BREEMER:

Burson basically

said the opposite of what you're saying.

Directly and

MR. BREEMER:

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

-- passive versus

19

active sounds a lot like the act/omission

20

distinction, and that has proven to be one of

21

the most slippery concepts in all of law.

22

Is it an act to put on a button or is

23

it an omission to not speak about what's on the

24

button?

25

if it were instead a sign on my head, you know,

A T-shirt, you say, is passive.

line you're -- you're suggesting?

How are we supposed to police the

MR. BREEMER:

Well, what I'm

5

suggesting, Your Honor, is that the line is

already policed.

7

8

are already regulated by other statutes.

MR. BREEMER:

Yes, it probably would,

Your Honor.

4

to vote -- as far as I understand it, the right

5

to vote free of intimidation, but there's not a

6

right to vote free of being bothered at all.

7

Polling places are not pristine retreats from

8

the real world, and I don't believe the

9

government can sacrifice the First Amendment to

10

That's true.

But there's no right

make them that way.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you -­

12

you say that, but I wonder if the state can

13

make an opposite determination and say, you

14

know, for however many months we've had this,

15

you know, maybe bitter, sharp, political

16

campaign going on, and maybe, just before you

17

cast your vote, you should be able to have a

18

time for some quiet reflection or to do that

19

important civic obligation in peace and quiet

20

without being bombarded by another campaign

21

display.

22

And it -- you know, you say these are

23

-- it's passive but not active, but, you know,

24

a picture can be worth a thousand words, and

25

people's apparel can convey very strong and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
11
1

shocking images that maybe the state can decide

2

that, just before you cast your vote, you

3

should have at least a moment free of all the

4

Sturm und Drang of the campaign.

5

MR. BREEMER:

That -- that's true.

6

And there are legitimate interests in the

7

polling place.

8

of the material that it wants to get at, if not

9

all of it, is already covered.

10

The problem here is that most

amount that you're suggesting is not covered -­

2

MR. BREEMER:

3

goes far beyond that.

4

But the statute here

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- you're pressured

5

to come up with a workable rule to guide us

6

when we write this decision.

7

MR. BREEMER:

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

Yes, Your Honor.
And you're -- you're

telling, in response to the Chief Justice,

10

basically, that the state's interest in -- in

11

-- in decorum and solemnity and the dignity of

12

the voting process cannot be protected by rules

13

relating to buttons and apparel.

14

MR. BREEMER:

I'm saying, Your Honor,

15

that it -- it's not reasonably protected in

16

this instance because it sweeps in so much

17

material that's not reasonably related to those

18

interests -- interests.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, suppose we think

20

that it would be a different case and that a

21

state could have a law that prohibits the

22

wearing of buttons or any other -- or attire

23

that contains the name of a candidate or refers

24

to a ballot issue or the name of a political

25

party that has candidates running for office in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1

that election.

2

If we thought that that would be

3

consistent with the First Amendment, would that

4

doom your case or would you still have

5

additional arguments?

6

MR. BREEMER:

No, that -- Your Honor,

7

that is one place where you can draw the line.

8

And if the line is drawn there, this statute

9

still fails.

10

It's still overbroad because it

sweeps in so much other -- all political -­

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And -- and what would

12

be the justification for that line, in your

13

view?

14

MR. BREEMER:

Well, the justification

for -­

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

In other words, why

17

would we put one -- all the materials that

18

Justice Alito talked about on one side of the

19

line and all the materials that you think a

20

state cannot restrict on the other side of the

21

line?

22

In your view, what's the difference?
MR. BREEMER:

I think that you could

23

arguably conclude that that type of apparel is

24

reasonably related to the government's

25

legitimate interest in preventing undue

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

influence in polling places, but shirts that

2

simply say AFL-CIO, Chamber of Congress, NAACP,

3

those are not related to the government's

4

How about issues

MR. BREEMER:

Yes, Your Honor, I would

-- that would be -­

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So

10

let's talk about a fiscal matter.

Could

11

someone then wear a button or a shirt or could

12

the state ban a button or a shirt that said

13

"Restrain Government Spending"?

14

MR. BREEMER:

No, Your Honor, I don't

15

believe it could, because the connection is so

16

--

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I think your

18

adversary says they can because it's a

19

political issue display.

20
21
22
23

MR. BREEMER:

That's correct.

I think

they do -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And that's where

you say they can't?

24

MR. BREEMER:

No.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We say -­
Even though that's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15

on the ballot?

2

MR. BREEMER:

A fiscal issue?

I think

3

the connection would be too attenuated because

4

then you could extrapolate forever.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

To you.

But do

6

you think a reasonable observer would think

7

it's too attenuated?

8

MR. BREEMER:

I think a -- yes, I do

think a reasonable observer would not see

11

towards something on the ballot.

12

13

by the blunt means of -- of outlying

15

everything.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that's
It seeks to

Can you -­
But they have a

18

statute that covered one thing that is in this

19

case, it's not hypothetical, it doesn't have to

20

do with an issue on the ballot, but the "Please

21

ID Me, Please ID Me" button, which was

22

challenged and then you chose not to pursue

23

that.

24
25

But what is your position on that?
Could a legitimately challenged statute stop

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

you from having the "Please ID Me" button?

2

MR. BREEMER:

Yes, it could.

And I

3

think the Minnesota's anti-deception,

4

anti-fraud statute that's already on the books

5

could be used -- could have been used and could

6

be in the future, if similar circumstances come

7

up, could be used to deal with that button.

8

That's Section 20 -- 211B.07 again.

9

anti-intimidation statute.

10

That's the

There is also a fraud statute, which

11

is 204C.035.

12

can be already addressed through its election

13

statutes.

14

so overbroad, is that it's trying -- they're

15

trying to get at a small slice of potentially

16

uncovered material by banning all political

17

expression in association, even items that

18

don't go to ballot issues, that don't go to

19

candidates, that are just personal expression

20

of political beliefs and political values.

21

All the government's interests

And that's what makes this statute

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It -- it just is a

22

little bit hard, Mr. Breemer, to evaluate an

23

argument of overbreadth unless we have a clear

24

view from you as to how far you think a state

25

could go.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1

So I'm not sure that you've given us

2

that view.

3

accept Justice Alito's suggestion, or do you

4

want to draw the line at some other place so

5

that we know, okay, that's permissible, this is

6

impermissible, how does this relate to that?

7

That's the usual way overbreadth analysis goes.

8
9

I mean, are you -- do you want to

MR. BREEMER:

Yes, Your Honor.

And

it's -- it's -- it's very difficult, given the

10

range of available material that's out there

11

and the number of interests the government has

12

here, to be able to put every item in the -- in

13

the appropriate box.

14

draw a line, other than drawing a line through

15

this particular sentence, which would allow the

16

government to continue to pursue its interests

17

but accommodate free speech.

18

I think it's very hard to

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I agree -­

Well, if -- if the

19

Court is concerned about preserving the dignity

20

and the decorum and the solemnity of the voting

21

process, and the statute is as difficult as you

22

say, isn't that an argument for allowing good

23

faith determination on a case-by-case basis by

24

the polling officials?

25

MR. BREEMER:

No, I wouldn't say that,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
18
1

Your Honor, because, in the meantime, free

2

speech would be chilled.

3

conventional political expression in

4

association that no reasonable person would see

5

as a threat to the polling place would be

6

chilled in the process, as it's being chilled

7

right now and will continue to be chilled

8

unless this statute is invalidated.

9

All -- all this

So I agree that it's a possible line

10

to draw at advocacy material, but, in any

11

event, the statute would fail because it still

12

sweeps in the rest of the conventional type -­

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If -- if that were

14

where we drew the line, I mean, what -- what

15

would be encompassed in advocacy material?

16

Would it be only things that named a

17

candidate's name?

18

MR. BREEMER:

Your Honor, I think it

19

would be anything that said for or against a

20

candidate or an issue directly on the ballot.

21
22
23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

How about if it said

"Resist"?
MR. BREEMER:

otherwise, you start to bleed over and pretty

9

advocacy or promotion of any point of view?

10

MR. BREEMER:

A state could say that,

11

yes, Your Honor, and Minnesota has said that.

12

I'm sorry if I misunderstood.

13

question was whether you could create an

14

entirely First Amendment-free zone in the

15

polling place.

16

would be, no, you -- you can't.

17

I thought your

And -- and my answer to that

And this gets close to a First

18

Amendment-free zone because political speech is

19

such a core part of the First Amendment that

20

it's a political speech-free zone.

21

you may be able -- the government may be able

22

to ban a certain small class of material, for

23

instance, the advocacy material, it couldn't

24

sweep in all the rest of the available

25

political speeches out there, "Resist" shirts,

And while

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

"Me Too" and so on.

2

it's doing here.

3

this legitimate speech by -- to -- to go after

4

a small slice that it can already regulate

5

under its other statutes.

6

But that's exactly what

It's trying to silence all

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So what -- what do

7

you put in what the state can do in addition to

8

vote for candidate X or vote against

9

proposition Y?

10

MR. BREEMER:

As a bright-line rule,

11

Your Honor, I don't -- I don't see any other

12

feasible bright line.

13

would have to -- if there's an intimidating

14

message that comes in, I think the state would

15

have to deal with that on an as-applied basis,

16

as -- as events occur under its existing

17

statutes like such -­

18

I think that the state

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You took the

19

position that "Me Too" -- "Please ID Me" wasn't

20

intimidating.

21
22

MR. BREEMER:

No, Your Honor, I don't

think I -­

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Or that it was

24

free speech that should not be stifled,

25

correct?

Are you changing your mind on that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
22
1

now?

2

MR. BREEMER:

No.

Our position was

3

that, as pure speech, just the words on that

4

button were -- yes, it was protected speech,

5

that's correct.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So there's always

7

line-drawing.

8

speech or not, someone's going to have to draw

9

a line.

10

Whether you call it intimidating

So going back to Justice Kennedy's

11

point, why, if this is not a public forum, why

12

can't the state reasonably draw the line at

13

saying political speech of any kind can be

14

potentially intimidating in a voting place and

15

we won't permit it?

16

MR. BREEMER:

I think the -- the -­

17

the reason is that the First Amendment

18

continues, as I mentioned before, continues to

19

apply in polling places.

create these -­

that on a military base we would say it would

be okay for the Army to say on military grounds

7

we're not going to permit political speech.

8
9

MR. BREEMER:

Well, I'm not quite sure

about that, Your Honor, because, in Greer, in

10

the Greer decision, the Court said that

11

conventional political speech would not be

12

banned.

13

This Court has never upheld a

14

prohibition on political speech as broad as

this.

20

in Greer, the Court said that conventional

MR. BREEMER:

It's true, they are

important interests, and -- and we don't deny

that.

lot -­

The problem is that the means being used

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18

MR. BREEMER:

You're -- you're -­

-- of political

19

expression that doesn't have a reasonable

20

connection to those particular interests, like

21

simply wearing a shirt that identifies an

22

organization that has political views or a hat

23

or any other sort of apparel that simply

24

identifies the wearer's personal beliefs.

25

A lot of this material is not worn as

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
25

advocacy or to influence but simply as

2

self-expression on the day of election when

3

people want to express their own political

views when everyone is talking about them and

6

I don't believe we -- our position is it cannot

be banned even under the -- the most lenient

test because it's not related to these

interests.

So that type of material,

threatening, intimidating material, threats to

particular classes, that could be under

You know,

employer, the union, teachers, whatever, say

20

we're all going to show up and we're all going

21

to have, you know, these -- these buttons on or

22

whatever, and maybe you're a member of the

23

group and you don't agree with the position and

24

you'll feel some pressure to transform your

25

speech from what you really would like to say

Heritage Reporting Corporation

5

MR. BREEMER:

Yes, Your Honor.

And if

6

that situation did come up, it could be

7

addressed under Section 204C.06, which

8

prohibits voter interference and disorderly

conduct and loitering in the polling place.

As-applied under

Under what?

You

have to have a statute to apply.
MR. BREEMER:

Yes.

And I -- and I'm

still referring to the other statutes that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
27
1

could be addressed as an as-applied challenge

2

under those situations -- under those existing

3

statutes because it's crossing the line.

that kind of situation, it would cross the line

5

between speech and conduct.

6

the line between speech and conduct -- or

speech and electioneering, if you draw the line

8

at advocacy, it would cross the line between

9

you could deal with it on that situation.

11

I would mention, though, it is -- it

is -- it is a fact that that type of behavior

is already not allowed in polling places

14

because of the other interests in statutes in

As far as I know, Your

Honor -- it's not in this record.

16

know, that they -- that there hasn't been any

17

instances of a disruption caused by people

18

wearing apparel, except for when polling

19

workers confront people wearing apparel and

20

then stop the process to try and police their

21

clothes.

22

As far as I

And that's part of the problem here,

23

is that disruption and intimidation is often

24

going to occur through the policing of

25

someone's shirt, not through the fact that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

29

they're passively wearing it as they go in and

2

out of the polling place.

JUSTICE ALITO:

determinations at a general election in

know how many there are.

We also know that there's -- there's other

JUSTICE ALITO:

So they're selected by

19

the parties.

party thinks that the attire of a particular

21

voter violates this law, what happens?

the final decision?

23

So, if a -- an official from one

MR. BREEMER:

what happens?

Then I -- I think they

7

would call the head judge, Your Honor, and

8

there would be a decision -- head election

9

judge and there would be a decision being made.

10

And in the meantime, there would be a

11

disruption going on in the polling place

12

because apparel is being policed.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. BREEMER:

question.

My co-counsel may.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I'll ask -- I

22

guess I'll ask the state.

Do you know whether

23

these -- these people have any training?

24

they all chosen to be the reasonable observer?

25

Do they, you know, test them to see if they're

2

know?

3

MR. BREEMER:

Do we

I don't know.

I know

4

that they try to train them, Your Honor.

5

this is how the Election Day policy in this

6

case came up.

7

to train the officials to -- polling officials

8

to apply this very broadly to material that

9

names an organization, advocacy material, party

10

And

The election officials attempted

material, and not limited to that.

11

So there is some effort to train them,

12

but the effort in this case confirmed that this

13

statute sweeps so broadly that there's almost

14

virtual -- there's virtually nothing political

15

that it can't take in.

16

I'll reserve my remaining time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL ROGAN

21

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

22
23
24
25

MR. ROGAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Minnesota's restriction on speech in
the polling place does not violate the First

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
32
1

Amendment.

2

viewpoint-neutral speech restriction in a

3

quintessential nonpublic forum that protects

4

the fundamental right to vote.

5

It is a reasonable and

This Court has recognized that

6

ensuring the integrity of our electoral process

7

and protecting the fundamental right to vote

8

are government interests of the highest order

9

and that laws advancing these important

10

interests may constitutionally limit speech.

11

Minnesota's prohibition on political

12

apparel in the polling place is such a law.

13

This law protects the integrity of the

14

elections by preserving order and decorum in

15

the polling place, and preventing voter

16

confusion and intimidation.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It does reach

18

quite a bit beyond what I think a reasonable

19

observer would think is necessary.

20

you really think if someone has a shirt with

21

the tiniest little logo or inscription here,

22

that that's going to have any effect on

23

decorum?

Your Honor, the -- the -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

reasonable observer would understand is

2

advocating electoral choices.

3

ways, a -- a tiny lapel pin that no one can see

4

is -- is not going to be -­

5

So, in some

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You can see

6

it.

I mean, you can see it and you know it's

7

-- it's the logo of one of the campaigns.

8
9

MR. ROGAN:

Certainly, yes, Your

Honor, I do -- I do think that that causes the

10

-- the problems and is constitutionally

11

proscribable, and it's for the reasons that -­

12

that you discussed, which is the intimidation

13

that it -- that can occur is not just based on

14

the plain meaning of what is -- what the

15

apparel says, that it's somehow intimidating on

16

its own.

17

prophylactic measure designed to prevent the

18

type of intimidation that you talked about,

19

which is that having people identify with

20

particular candidates allows them to then

21

suddenly feel like they either have to comply

22

or that they are going to be singled out, and

23

that can lead to the intimidation.

24
25

It's -- it's -- it's a pro- -- it's a

And that's what the history of -- in
Minnesota and in states in the late 1800s that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
34
1

led this Court in Burson to uphold exactly that

2

type of prohibition.

3
4
5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
know if I discuss the issues.

Well, I don't

I ask questions.

But I just don't understand where the

6

disruption of the decorum comes with respect to

7

anything that qualifies as -- as political.

8

-- I mean, people going to vote certainly would

9

expect that they would see people arguing for

I

10

their candidates or the other candidates,

11

though maybe not within 100 feet or whatever.

12

But the idea that they're going to be protected

13

from recognizing that other people support

14

different candidates than they might, I think,

15

is a bit more of a stretch.

16

MR. ROGAN:

Certainly, Your Honor, and

17

-- and I think -- I think Burson recognized

18

that order and decorum can be called into

19

question by simply wearing campaign material.

20

All that Minnesota's law does is extend that

21

line to political material.

22

And it's for the exact same reasons.

23

It's that when you have a campaign that's gone

24

on for months, and we end up at the Election

25

Day in the polling place where we've asked

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

people to come forward to exercise their right

2

to vote, that is a place where we want to

3

ensure that there's order and decorum so that

4

there is the solemnity that goes with voting.

5

And having people identify themselves

6

with a pin that is a campaign or a political

7

message on it reasonably could lead to

8

disruption.

9

And that disruption -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How would -- how

10

would -- well, how far does -- does this go?

11

The -- the clear case is a pin that says "Vote

12

For Candidate X."

13

Petitioner that you can't wear a pin saying "Me

14

Too," you can't wear a pin saying "ACLU Defends

15

Free Speech"?

16

But we're told by the

MR. ROGAN:

Your Honor, the -- the

17

line that we have drawn is campaign material

18

plus political material, with the definition of

19

political material being reasonably related -­

20

a reasonable person would understand that the

21

message that's being delivered is one regarding

22

electoral choices in the polling place.

23

And so -­

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

So where -- where

does that limitation come in, electoral choices

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
36
1

in the polling place?

2

MR. ROGAN:

Your Honor, it comes from

3

the definition of political, which is in an

4

Election Day -- Election Day electioneering

5

statute, and from the definition of political

6

purpose, which is in the statute which

7

describes -- that uses the word "political" to

8

mean influencing voting in an election.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

The problem is that so

10

many things have political connotations, and

11

the connotations are in the eye of the

12

beholder.

13

have hundreds, maybe thousands of officials in

14

Minnesota, and every one of them probably

15

thinks that he or she is the reasonable

16

observer, and they're making a determination

17

about whether something has political

18

connotations.

19

And on Election Day, you're going to

And in one of your elections, in 2016,

20

I think, you had -- the President was running,

21

members of the House were running, members of

22

the State Legislature were running, State

23

Judges were running.

24

elections.

25

There were local

There was one ballot question.

So the observer would have to know all

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
37
1

of the issues in all of those campaigns and

2

would have to decide whether something had

3

connotations regarding any of those issues.

4

It's -- it's an invitation for

5

arbitrary and -- arbitrary enforcement and

6

enforcement that's not even-handed.

7

have no idea where the line lies.

8
9

And I -- I

Some of the examples that were raised
in the Eighth Circuit were really pretty -- and

10

-- and the state said, yes, that would be

11

prohibited.

12

prohibited?

13

An AFL-CIO shirt, that would be

MR. ROGAN:

So, Your Honor, the -- I

14

think the -- the answer is that it has two

15

components to it.

16

relating to electoral choices and it has to be

17

well-known.

18

It has to be understood as

So many of the examples that -- that

19

you talked about simply wouldn't be well-known.

20

It's -- it's a reasonable observer sitting in

21

the polling place on Election Day, after

22

there's been a campaign, after there's been the

23

issues that have been raised that are relevant

24

to the election, deciding whether or not they

25

believe that it's reasonable to understand the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

message being -­

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah.

Well, that

3

makes it worse, that it has to be -- well, it's

4

not only does it have to be a political

5

message, but it has to be well-known.

6

what is well-known?

7

MR. ROGAN:

What -­

Well, Your Honor, the

8

political has a -- has a plain meaning in our

9

statute based on that it -- it's influencing

10

elections.

11

What I -- all that I'm describing is

12

that something that is political, for example,

13

that is known to only a few people but is

14

clearly political, is not going to be something

15

that's going to be reasonably understood by

16

voters in the polling place.

that that's political.

JUSTICE BREYER:

You can do this too,

3

I guess, with the -- can't you, with the need

4

in state-run hospitals to restrict conversation

5

in certain areas to medical matters, the need

6

in law schools or other schools to restrict

7

conversation in the class to the subject that

8

is being taught, including politics, the need

9

in -- I don't know, you make it up, but I -­

10

because that's what we're doing, that's what

11

I'm doing, and I can think of many, many

12

instances where thousands, perhaps millions, of

13

people have to have the authority to operate a

14

standard to restrict the speech to the subject

15

that's at hand.

16

And so, if, in fact, we are trying to

17

have a place where a person has reflective

18

thought for a moment after the hurly-burly of

19

the campaign, this problem will inevitably

20

arise.

21

One way of correcting mistakes is

22

through as-applied challenges after the event.

occurs if there is speech that is pro -­

then is, if the person can either cover it up

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How -- but the

-- I guess the issue is, how do you know if a

mistake has been made?

6

makes a judgment and it's challenged, how do

7

you know a mistake's been made?

8

there's -- the question -- the concern, of

9

course, it's what the case could be largely

You know, if someone

I mean,

10

about, is whether or not there are standards

11

that can be applied in a reasonable way.

12

And it's not a question really of

review in an as-applied or other challenge to

see if there's been a mistake, unless the

courts are going to be in the position of

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Is there -- is there

6

any evidence -- usually, in First Amendment

7

cases, we're concerned about overbreadth

8

because of the chilling effect that's often

9

undocumented.

And the burden is usually on the

10

state to justify a compelling interest rather

11

than the other way around.

12

And so I guess my question for you is

13

it sounds like Minnesota's law is a bit of an

14

outlier compared to most of the country's.

15

There may be nine states or so with -- with a

16

statute that goes this far.

17

documented need for a statute to go this far as

18

opposed to what happens in most other states,

19

which is limited to electioneering?

20

MR. ROGAN:

Is there any

Your Honor, I think the

21

premise of your question is -- is -- is

22

Minnesota's use of the word "political."

23

there are 11 states that use the word

24

"political."

25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Okay, 11.

And

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Whatever

Official
49
1

number it is, it's a minority number.

And

2

under your interpretation of "political," it

3

would forbid people from wearing certain

4

portions of the Bill of Rights into a polling

5

place but not other portions of the Bill of

6

Rights.

7

And I guess I'm just wondering what

8

compelling interest Minnesota has identified

9

that requires a statute that goes so much

10

further than the vast majority of states?

11

MR. ROGAN:

Your Honor, the -- the -­

the forum analysis would indicate that the

burden on the state is only to show

reasonableness and that -- that our statute

history of elections that was sufficient in

Burson to show that wearing campaign material

would have a detrimental effect on the polling

25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Again, Burson was

electioneering, a different statute, and you're

asking us to go a step further than Burson.

campaign speech to additional political speech.

MR. ROGAN:

20

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

21

MR. ROGAN:

Okay.

-- beyond expressed

22

advocacy that is -- that would be defined as -­

23

as campaign speech.

24

the First Amendment issue here, as -- as my

25

friend has described it, is whether or not

And I think that the -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
51
1

there is any ability to -- to ban what they

2

call passive speech.

3

The line that they've drawn here is

4

not one about campaign speech or political

5

speech or the way that -- that this Court has

6

described it, which is that there are instances

7

where you can ban any type of speech, including

8

on this Court's plaza, where any speech or any

9

message on a banner, flag, or device is

10

prohibited.

11

Those are the types -- it's clear that

12

this Court has allowed the states to prohibit

13

what they call passive speech, and instead of

14

describing what the category is of speech,

15

whether it's campaign, political, or all

16

speech, their rule is, if it's on a T-shirt, it

17

doesn't matter what it says, that you can wear

18

it in a polling place.

19

And that was squarely rejected in

20

Burson.

And it was for the reasons that it

21

impacts the integrity of the election by having

22

political or campaign speech and it impacts the

23

decorum and solemnity of the polling place to

24

have that type of speech in the -- in the

25

polling place.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
52

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Rogan, could you

2

explain that for me a little bit more?

3

Because, I mean, there are clearly some places

4

where we think -- you know, the courtroom is a

5

good example, where we don't want anybody to be

6

wearing buttons or wearing shirts of -- of the

7

kind that you're talking about.

8
9

But why should a polling place be that
sort of place?

In other words, you talk about

10

the decorum, the solemnity.

11

little bit church-like.

Makes it sound a

12

Why -- why is a polling place that?

13

Why isn't it just the culmination of what is

14

often a rowdy political process?

15

MR. ROGAN:

So for two reasons, Your

16

Honor.

17

process ends before you get into the polling

18

place so that we can have an election that has

19

integrity, that citizens -- we have to -- what

20

we're doing is we're taking the citizens'

21

decisions about who to vote for and turning it

22

into electoral choices.

23

I think -- I think the rowdy political

And for that process to have

24

integrity, the beginning of the process, the

25

act of voting itself, has to have integrity.

And the integrity is not just actual integrity

2

to vote was able to vote.

4

5

It has to be

And one of the problems with allowing

8

example is, if you have two people, one wearing

wearing one -- in Minnesota, we have

challengers who can challenge the eligibility

other voter, the perception is, did they do

15

that because of partisan reasons?

16

the election judge who asks extra questions of

the person wearing the "Make America Great

applications of your very broad statute.

3

MR. ROGAN:

Your Honor, there -- there

4

is no evidence of any viewpoint discrimination

5

in Minnesota in its 100 years.

6

earlier asked, the -- the way that this process

7

works is that there are at least four poll

8

workers in every single precinct in Minnesota,

9

and when they're busy, there are more.

10

And as you had

And

they are from different political parties.

11

that -- that -- that could occur is likely to

would happen in that instance is -- is either

the person would -- would cover it up or there

13

16

would be resolved and it would be resolved by

the -­

18

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

And then it

And who's the head

election judge?
MR. ROGAN:

The head election judge is

21

a judge who's selected by the city clerk

22

because they are -- they -- they have more

23

training and -- and usually they've been an

24

election judge for -- for a long period of time

25

so that they're familiar with all the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
56
1

processes.

2

And I think, you know, one of the

3

things that -- that -- that I think is

4

important to understand is election judges have

5

discretion to make a lot of different decisions

6

in polling places.

7

same-day registration.

8

about whether or not somebody's qualified, has

9

-- has met their requirements to -- to

In Minnesota, we have

We also have challenge voters, when

12

somebody is challenged because for -- are they

13

a felon or are they somehow not eligible to

14

vote, the election judge puts them under oath

15

and asks them questions and makes a

16

determination about whether or not they're

17

eligible to vote.

18

So the idea that -- that making a -- a

19

-- a decision about whether or not something is

20

political or not is well within the

21

understanding of -- of a -- of an election

22

judge in Minnesota.

23

the important issue here is the state's

24

interest is the fundamental right to vote.

25

And I think that the -­

This isn't just prohibiting speech in

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Let me ask you about

12

one of the interests that you assert in your

13

brief, and this is on page 46 of your brief.

14

"A voter could well feel confused or

15

intimidated if she walked into a polling place

16

and discovered that every other voter held the

17

opposite point of view on any number of

18

controversial political issues related to

19

electoral choices, as evidenced by the

20

political messages displayed on other voters'

21

apparel."

22

Do you think that's a compelling state

23

interest?

24

legitimate state interest?

25

Do you think that's even a

MR. ROGAN:

Yes, Your Honor, I think

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
58
1

it's -- I think it's a legitimate state

2

interest in a polling place to prohibit

3

material that is going to make one voter feel

4

singled out, that -- that they could feel that

5

they are not welcome in that polling place

6

because they don't hold the same political

7

views as everybody else.

8
9

And, ultimately, it could lead to the
type of subtle intimidation that Burson found

10

could be -- could be found just by wearing a

11

vote for, pick your candidate.

12

The -- the -- the interests of making

13

sure that the polling place doesn't have

14

political material is the exact same interest

15

that this Court found was sufficient to

prohibit campaign material.

it happened in this case, where somebody brings

11

a lawsuit, but -- but in -- in the -- in the

12

case where somebody wears material, they either

13

-- they -- they can continue to wear it, as -­

14

as the Petitioners did here, and then go into

15

an -- an administrative process and say it's

16

not political, I -- I have a right to wear

17

this.

18

So there's -- there's an easy way for

19

somebody who believes that the material that

20

they're wearing is not political to have an

21

administrative review of that if they believe

22

that the -- that the election judges are acting

23

inappropriately.

law and you say, okay, go ahead, but, you know,

the lack of, you know, nothing terribly bad

interest.

MR. ROGAN:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And that

Your Honor -­
Aren't you

12

worried -- if you're not worried about

13

intimidation, why do you let somebody go in

14

with a button that violates your -- your

15

policy, or why is the only thing you do is

16

write his name down?

17

MR. ROGAN:

Your Honor, our the -- the

18

enforcement of this statute is done primarily

19

by election judges telling people to cover up

the material.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In other words,

there's the voting booth and the table where

you give your registration.

voters see this going on, they see the shirt

5

and they hear the argument, or is that in some

6

different room?

MR. ROGAN:

No, Your Honor, it happens

And so do other

that's more disruptive than wearing the shirt.

that it's a quick conversation, and it -­

works.

MR. ROGAN:

Certainly, Your Honor.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And we just said

19

that -- you say a quick conversation, then the

20

other judge comes over, then the intervening

21

judge.

And so I'm sitting there waiting in line for my

23

vote, and I hear all of this stuff?

That's got to take at least 10 minutes.

MR. ROGAN:

Your Honor, if -- if there

was -- if there was such a discussion as that,

what would happen is it would -- they would

take it to a different -- a different area to

talk about that.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. -- Mr. Rogan, I

5

assume that the real work of this statute is

6

being done by the fact that people know about

7

it and so people just don't wear these things

8

for the most part.

9

have cases where people don't know about it or

10

maybe they want to challenge it, but those are

11

going to be few and far between, and -- and the

12

real work is that people just approach the

13

polling place in a different kind of way.

MR. ROGAN:

And you're always going to

That's correct, Your

that it's only political material that is going

electoral choices, because it -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose a group of

people want to make a statement about a

political issue, not a political candidate but

9

a political issue, and they say we're going to

10

do that by wearing all white on Election Day

11

when we go to the polls.

12

Would that be allowed?

13

MR. ROGAN:

Under the statute, yes.

14

It's not a political badge, button, or

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BREEMER:

The statute does affect

10

millions of people that go to the polls in

11

Minnesota, at polling places, absentee ballot

12

locations throughout the state for 46 days

13

prior to the election, and so what you just

14

heard, I believe, is that there's going to be

15

an effect of chilling all this legitimate

16

speech, Me Too, Resist, Black Lives Matter,

17

American Legion, Americans For Tax Reform, and

18

the list goes on.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

told by Respondent that it has to be connected

21

to an electoral choice in that election.

MR. BREEMER:

and that's what they're saying now, but

5

had to remove their clothing or have their name

and address taken down for potential

prosecution in order to vote.

We also have a number of other people

enforcement.

13

And

That's at the Joint Appendix at

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

Let's

14

not forget who these people were and what they

were wearing, "Please ID Me," which for some

intimidate people to leave the polling booth -­

other people to leave the polling booth.

but it wasn't just the buttons.

incidences involving the examples that Justice

that, but we do have record evidence of slogans

like "Don't Tread On Me," "Liberty," that type
