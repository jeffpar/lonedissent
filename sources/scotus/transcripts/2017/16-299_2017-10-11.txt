CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

5

National Association of Manufacturers versus

6

the Department of Defense, et al.

Mr. Bishop.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY S. BISHOP

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BISHOP:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The Clean Water Act provides for

13

judicial review in the courts of appeals of

14

seven categories of action by the EPA

15

Administrator, and those are defined narrowly

16

and precisely in Section 1369(b)(1) of the Act.

17

Had Congress meant for courts of

18

appeals to review all national or definitional

19

rules, it would have said so, as it did in the

20

Clean Air Act, instead of listing a handful of

21

particular EPA actions down to the statutory

22

subsection.

23

Our textual approach to subsections

24

(b)(1) and (E) -- (b)(1)(E) and (F) results in

25

a comparatively clear jurisdictional rule that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

4
1

would eliminate many duplicative filings and

2

years of litigation over where to litigate.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What would happen

4

if two questions were presented?

5

involves whether the water in question fits

6

within "waters of the United States"; that's a

7

preliminary question.

8

challenge to a grant -- a grant or denial of a

9

permit.

10
11
12

The first

And then there's a

If you had those two combined, where
do they go?
MR. BISHOP:

Well, I -- I think,

13

Justice Ginsburg, that the -- the Court has

14

never answered that question.

15

of the DuPont case, which involved 1304(b)

16

guidelines, this Court suggested that when you

17

have a challenge that includes actions covered

18

by (E) or (F) and that are not covered by (E)

19

or (F), that it may be possible to exercise

20

ancillary jurisdiction over the question not -­

21

not covered.

22

should not apply in that case.

23
24
25

In Footnote 14

Of course, the (b)(2) preclusion

But, you know, in any event, the
challenge here is to the waters rule by itself.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

One of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

things, putting -- I mean, obviously, your main

2

emphasis is, of course, on the statutory

3

language, but one of the consequences that your

4

opponent points out is that if you're correct

5

and these actions are brought in the district

6

court, each of the district courts will have to

7

review the entire administrative record, and

8

presumably, you could have dozens of the

9

district courts engaged in that same activity,

10

and then it would have to be done all over

11

again when you get to the court of appeals.

12

MR. BISHOP:

Well, I mean, I think

13

their argument is that that is inefficient,

14

right, but their rule -­

15
16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you'll

agree that it's inefficient, won't you?

17

MR. BISHOP:

Well, their -- their rule

18

-- I mean, their rule has its own efficiency

19

problem, which is that it's not clear.

20

what you end up with under a rule that isn't

21

clear is extremely inefficient.

22

And, you know, here we have -- this

23

rule was promulgated in June of 2015.

24

have -­

25

And

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We

Well what

Heritage Reporting Corporation

about my efficiency concern?

2

MR. BISHOP:

Well, I -- I think -- the

3

point I'm trying to make there, Chief Justice,

4

is just that there are inefficiencies on both

5

sides.

6

efficiency does not conquer all.

7

to litigate these issues in the district court

8

because we think that going through the

9

district courts and the courts of appeals will

10

produce more accurate decision-making and will

11

tee the case up better for this Court to

12

review.

13

This Court said in Sackett that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We would like

But they're -­

14

I -- I take it that means they're right, that

15

that's what -- that's what this would entail.

16

MR BISHOP:

Well, I can -­

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And the

18

district court, to do the correct job, would

19

have to look at the whole record, and as many

20

district courts as these actions have been

21

brought would have to do that.

22

court of appeals would do it again all over.

23

MR. BISHOP:

And then the

That's true.

case, that is what happened, for example.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What would be the

10

inducement for that if we were to say this

11

needs to go to district court?

Why would

12

parties run to the courthouse?

They would

13

either wait for an enforcement proceeding or

14

wait for a denial of a permit or just wait, and

15

the waiting would then result in the

16

inefficiencies that the Chief Justice just

17

pointed to.

18

a rule being constantly challenged and never

19

truly finalized.

Even worse, because we would have

wait to challenge a rule like this.

If the government lost these

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can -- can you

explain to me, I know you have a textual

17

argument, but is there some sense in having

18

individual permit grant or denial go to the

19

court of appeals and a question of the

20

definition here of "waters of the United

21

States" that goes to the district court?

22

would think it would be just the other way

23

around.

24
25

MR. BISHOP:

One

Well, can I -- can I say

two things about that, Justice Ginsburg?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

The

Official

9
1

first is that Congress itself put the 1342 NPDS

2

permits into (b)(1), so those are reviewed in

3

the court of appeals.

4

with 1344 fill permits.

5

no problem whatsoever with the idea that permit

6

-- permits could be challenged in different

7

courts, even though exactly the same WOTUS

8

decision would be made in both of those types

9

of permit.

10

It do -- did not do that
So Congress itself had

The second -- the second thing is that

11

this idea that there is bifurcation here is -­

12

is false.

13

In fact, WOTUS decisions are litigated

14

in the district court.

15

the district court when the rule is challenged,

16

under our approach here, but they're also

17

litigated in the district court when a

18

particularized decision is made.

19

They're litigated in

Riverside Bayview, SWANCC,

20

Rapanos/Carrabel, Sackett, Hawkes, all of this

21

Court's cases addressing this question have

22

come up through the district courts.

23

arise in enforcement proceedings, in -- out of

24

compliance orders, or out of permits.

25

And these

By the time that a party seeks an NPDS

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

10
1

permit, it knows very well whether or not it

2

has "waters of the United States" on its

3

property.

4

And if you think about your Miccosukee

5

case or the LA River case, I think it's clear

6

why.

7

Miccosukee or if you have a constructed part of

8

the LA River as in that case, you've already

9

had to get the fill permit before you ever get

10
11

If you are building a huge pump as in

to the NPDS proceeding.
As a practical matter, nobody

12

challenges a WOTUS determination in a 1342

13

permit proceeding.

14

through the incredible expense of that permit

15

without first having determined where the

16

agency is through one of these more formal

17

proceedings, like a J.D. at issue in Hawkes,

18

which was reviewed, the J.D., as you said, in

19

Hawkes is reviewed in the district -- no one is

20

going to do that unless they know whether they

21

have WOTUS.

22

No one is ever going to go

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Bishop, could I

23

step back just for a bit?

I mean, I understand

24

that your basic argument is the list is the

25

list and what's on the list controls.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

11
1

MR. BISHOP:

Right.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But if I said to you

3

what was Congress's theory behind the list, do

4

you think Congress had one?

5

MR. BISHOP:

To be honest, I do not -­

6

I cannot explain that and I have never heard

7

anyone explain that to me.

8

at -- if you look at the list, (b) -- (b)(1)(B)

9

references a provision that was never enacted,

I mean, if you look

10

that doesn't exist.

11

of appeals promulgation of any standard or

12

performance under Section 1316, but (E) puts in

13

any approval or promulgation of a limitation

14

under 1316.

15

(A) puts into the courts

I mean, to me, this, and this was a

16

great surprise to me, there is an article that

17

we cite in our brief, Mead and Fromherz, that

18

just goes through a lot of different

19

jurisdictional provisions that Congress comes

20

up with and explains that a lot of them are

21

just not very carefully thought out.

22

I would say -­

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But what

So your basic view is,

24

look, you should just resign yourself to

25

thinking of this as having no particular

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

12

rationale.

2

can figure out what the reasons are that

3

Congress included those things and not other

4

things.

5

that's just what it is?

6
7

Nobody

It's all a themeless pudding and

MR. BISHOP:

And I think when you have

that sort of -­

8
9

Congress said what it said.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Is that -- is that the

idea?

10

MR. BISHOP:

Yes.

I think, you know,

11

if someone can come up with an explanation of

12

this that makes sense, I'm very happy to hear

13

it.

14

16

I have yet to hear one.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

to text of it -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Should we make

19

sense of it?

at least with respect to (E) is very simple.

21

Once you define navigable waters, you say where

22

an effluent limitation applies or doesn't.

23

Meaning the government's position

And so that's an effluent limitation.

24

It's attractive, simple.

Certainly no more

25

complex than your position in terms of its

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

13
1

consequences.

So -­

2

MR. BISHOP:

3

with that, Justice Sotomayor.

4

what it does is it eats up the entire (b)(1)

5

statute, where there's -- and, Justice Kagan,

6

these are not -- these are not careful

7

provisions, I mean, I'll give you that, but

8

they are precise, okay, they can be applied,

9

they are precise down to the last subsection in

And so if you apply the statutory
language, you have a clean jurisdictional rule.

complex ways in which the government -- I mean,

15

the government's reading essentially is because

16

of the breadth of 1311(a), the government's

reading is basically that anything that affects

under (E).

Well, let me give you

So, under 1311(b), and there

10

are many -- there are many more, this is just a

11

sampling, so under 1311(b), EPA is directed to

12

promulgate treatment standards for discharges

13

to publicly owned treatment works.

14

Under 1312, which is the water quality

15

standards provision, it is directed to

16

promulgate alternative effluent control

17

strategies needed to meet water quality

18

standards.

19

1316 is all about new source

20

performance standards, and there, among the

21

various things that the EPA is told that it

22

should do, you can come up with operating

23

methods for the source, operating methods for

24

the source to meet these standards.

25

And then, under 1345, which is the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

16

sewage sludge -- toxic sewage sludge, EPA is

2

told that it can promulgate management

3

practices.

4

there's an effluent limitation, is a specific,

usually numerical, limitation on the

quantities, rates, or concentrations of

pollutants.

those numbers, but something else that you can

that's true for each one of these, including

11

subsection (E).

effluent limitation or other limitation should

mean because words are known by the company

limitation, under the four listed sections, it

17

seems to me it's talking about the types of

18

limitations that those four sections

19

specifically tell EPA:

20

rule-making.

21

And each one of those is a distinct type of

22

activity.

23

Effluent limitation or other

Go engage in

Go do these types of activities.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

In the -- in the

24

government's brief, they ask -- they say, well,

25

what if we had just done it the following way?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

We, you know, issued a rule saying don't

2

discharge -- you can't discharge more than a

3

certain amount of a certain pollutant in these

4

following waters.

5

And just list the waters in the rule

6

that says how much of the pollutant you can't

7

discharge.

8

would come out differently, but it shouldn't

9

come out differently.

10

And they say, under your rule, that

MR. MURPHY:

I -- I think it would in

11

this sense:

12

me, nothing in Section 1311 directs them to do

13

that.

14

their general rule-making authority, which

15

would be in Section 1361(a).

16

catch-all.

17

issue rules to implement the Act.

18

exactly what the WOTUS rule is designed to

19

accomplish.

20

Nothing in Section 1311 either tells the EPA to

21

do that type of action or the WOTUS rule here.

22

Nothing in subsection or, excuse

That would be the agencies acting under

That's the

It says, the agencies, you can
That's

It's under that authority.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So let me make sure I

23

understand.

On -- on -- on that rule, if the

-- if somebody challenged that rule, where

25

would it go?

MR. MURPHY:

That would -- so I

assume, the -- the hypothetical was -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You -- you can't

discharge more than X amount of Y pollutant in

5

the following waters.

6

MR. MURPHY:

Okay.

So I think that

7

that -- it was just defining waters.

That

8

would -- that would strike me closer to an

9

effluent limitation because of the actual

10

limitation, but I still don't think it would be

11

under 1311.

12

effluent -­

13
14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17
18
19

Well, it's an effluent

limitation, but you say it's not under 1311.

15
16

1311 directs the EPA to set

MR. MURPHY:

Because it would be under

1361.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

So then it goes to the

district court?
MR. MURPHY:

Yes.

Yes.

It would go

20

to the district court, I think.

In -- but the

21

common theme of all four of these provisions, I

22

think, is it tells the EPA to undertake

23

specific types of actions.

24

technology-based limitations for existing

25

sources; 1312, switches to water quality-based

1311, the

2

1345, sewage sludge.

3

precise language directing EPA to engage in

4

activity, but there is nothing in the statute

5

that you can find that -- in any of these four

6

that says, EPA, please promulgate a definition

7

of "waters of the United States."

8
9

So I think that there's

JUSTICE ALITO:

But do you think that

the EPA has the power to issue the type of rule

10

that Justice Kagan described?

11

MR. MURPHY:

They very may not have

12

the power.

13

however, I do not think it would be a power

14

under 1311.

15

would flow from 1361, which is the general

16

authority to implement the Act.

17

If the -- if the power exists,

I think it would -- the power

I'd also like to turn briefly to the

18

Chief Justice's concerns with efficiency.

19

recognize there are efficiency concerns on the

20

other side, but -- but as DuPont itself

21

recognized in Footnote 26, there's a competing

22

wisdom to having things percolate up with more

23

review.

concerns and fairness concerns on -- on our

side.

7

Everybody would agree that it's

Efficiency concerns, this Court has

repeatedly said, repeatedly said, including in

9

Hertz and many other cases, that we should

10

establish clear jurisdictional rules.

12

should exist.

14

This

We've been litigating this

indicates, is better spent on litigating the

merits of the rule versus litigating where to

19

of future cases, it's much more likely

20

individuals will know where to go.

21

denying a permit, if it actually means issuing

22

or denying a permit, that's a -­

23

I think our rule, following the plain

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So for all sorts

Issuing or

You have -- do you

24

have any reason -- Mr. Bishop was candid in

25

telling us there doesn't seem to be any rhyme

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

25
1

or reason to this allocation.

2

MR. MURPHY:

Well, I do think that -­

3

the rhyme or reason I came up with is, if you

4

look at the seven actions, each of the sections

5

that is listed promulgate a standard of

6

performance.

7

effluent standard; under 1317, make a

8

determination with respect to a state permit

9

program -- these are all specific delegations

Under Section 306, a toxic

10

of authority to the agency to engage in the

11

specific types of actions that are listed.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you -- do you think

13

general -- I mean, does your interpretation

14

depend very much on a specific understanding of

15

the word "under"?

16

reading this to say something like under the

17

specific authority of Section 1311, 1312.

18

"under" is a kind of nebulous word.

19

say under the specific authority here.

20

says "under."

21

In other words, you are

But

It doesn't
It just

You might read "under" a little bit

22

differently.

You might read "under" to say

23

something like limitations regulating actions

24

taken under Sections 1311, 1312, et cetera.

25

So why should we read "under" your

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

26
1
2

way, rather than in some other way?
MR. MURPHY:

Yes, because I think you

3

-- "under" is absolutely -- the Court has said

4

it's a chameleon, but I think that when you

5

look at it in the entire phrase, promulgate or

6

approve an effluent limitation or under

7

limitation under these things, I think that our

8

position relies on the entire phrase.

9

And when you say "promulgate a

10

limitation under," that means that you're

11

enacting a regulation that is a restriction and

12

it's under these provisions.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I just -­

But how about -- I

14

take the point, but how about promulgating a

15

limitation, regulating actions taken under

16

1311, 1312?

17

come out the government's way.

18

If you did it that way, it would

MR. MURPHY:

I'm not certain that it

19

would, because this still would not qualify as

20

a limitation, it seems to me.

21

approach would have to be affecting a

22

limitation that exists within, because that's

23

essentially what they're arguing, that by

24

defining the "waters of the United States"

25

they're triggering -- triggering the ban on

I think their

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

27
1
2

discharges in 1311(a) and that's sufficient.
But the statute says "promulgate a

3

limitation."

4

"promulgate a limitation," the thing being

5

promulgated itself must be the restriction.

6

But they don't rely -­

7

When you hear the phrase

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes, but, on -- on the

8

other hand, you yourself treat this rule as

9

very much limiting your activities.

It is a

10

limitation on activities.

11

another limitation, to -- to say you can't

12

discharge pollutants where you want to

13

discharge pollutants, but it's very much part

14

and parcel of the limitation that you're

15

objecting to.

16

MR. MURPHY:

It's combined with

So I think the limitation

17

is 1311(a).

18

change the verb from promulgate to impose or -­

19

it certainly has a practical effect of

20

triggering a limitation, but so did the

21

compliance order in Sackett.

22

out of the district court.

23

That's why they have to always

And that flowed

I just think the practical effect

24

test, if you're going to adopt that, it's going

25

to be unclear in most cases whether something

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

28
1

has a practical effect of triggering a

2

limitation under 1311(a).

3

-- if we're in the Hertz world where we're

4

thinking of what's the clearer rule, I think we

5

provide a clear rule.

6

administrable in the range of cases.

7

So I think if you're

It's going to be easily

Under the government's approach,

8

because it's vague, I think it's going to lead

9

to a lot additional -- of additional litigation

10

over where to sue.

11

I guess the final point I would make

12

is we don't just have efficiency concerns on

13

our side.

14

side as well because of the (b)(2) ban on

15

raising things that could have been raised

16

under this jurisdictional provision, and later

17

civil or criminal enforcement proceedings.

18

We have fairness concerns on our

Justice Powell when talking about a

19

very similar review preclusion provision

20

suggested that he would interpret it narrowly

21

if he could.

22

In the Clean Air Act, it's quite

23

broad.

It's impossible to interpret it

24

narrowly.

25

agency action review that was at issue in

But I think the presumption of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

29
1

Sackett would trump the government's position,

2

given the unfairness that could arise.

3

And the Court should keep in mind that

4

every one of the Court's cases that it has

5

considered the "waters of the United States"

6

rule, those are cases that have arisen in

7

enforcement proceedings or other type of

8

district court review.

9

All of those under the government's

10

approach could now not be allowed if the

11

government's approach is allowed, because if

12

circuit review exists, then the (b)(2)

13

provision kicks in and it says that you cannot

14

have review and later criminal or civil

15

enforcement proceedings.

16

And I think that's unfair.

17

that's -- Sackett clearly indicated that the

18

presumption of agency action review extends to

19

this Act and it expressly said that that

20

presumption is a repudiation of the principle

21

that efficiency of agency action should trump

22

all.

23

equally applies here.

24
25

I think

And so I think that fairness concern

I also think that there are due
process concerns as well.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RACHEL P. KOVNER

5

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

6
7

MS. KOVNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

8
9

Thank you,

In order for a person to know what
they are prohibited from doing under Section

10

1311, they need to know both numerical

11

constraints that apply under that provision and

12

geographical constraints under that section.

13

A broad definition of "waters of the

14

United States" imposes broader limitations

15

under Section 1311.

16

imposes narrower limitations under Section

17

1311.

18

And a narrower definition

Indeed, the challengers are here today

19

challenging the rule precisely because they

20

submit it's going to impose broader

21

restrictions on their conduct under Section

22

1311.

23

And any doubt about whether

24

geographical limitations like this ought to be

25

treated as limitations under Section 1311 and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

31
1

subject to circuit court review is resolved by

2

this Court's cases interpreting this very

3

provision, which indicate that the provision

4

should be interpreted to avoid the irrational

5

bifurcation of similar or related decisions.

6

And none of the challengers here have

7

explained throughout the briefing or here today

8

why it is that Congress would want to bifurcate

9

the geographic aspects of limitations under

10

Section 1311 from the numerical aspects.

11

Indeed, I think as some -- some of the

12

questioning points out, this is the equivalent

13

of a rule that does those two things together,

14

that simply says a person shall not in the

15

following locations discharge pollutants

16

without a permit.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is there anything in

18

the definitional section that will not

19

indirectly affect something that is listed in

20

1369(b)?

21

Congress just include the definitional section

22

in the list of covered actions?

23

And if that's the case, why didn't

MS. KOVNER:

Well, I think the key

24

here is that there are -- Section 1311, there

25

are actually only a handful of critical terms

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

32
1

and we're defining one of those critical terms.

2

So it's not our submission that any term that

3

was defined throughout the statute is going to

4

affect limitations under Section 1311.

5

But here where you're defining, in

6

effect, discharge of a pollutant, which is

7

defined as discharge into the "waters of the

8

United States," you are expanding or

9

contracting the scope of the prohibition under

10

Section 1311.

11

And that's why it's the equivalent of

12

a rule that says on the following waters you

13

shall not discharge pollutants under Section

14

1311.

15

That would certainly be a limitation

16

that's promulgated under Section 1311 and it's

17

exactly what's happened here.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So -- so your

19

position is that interpreting a definitional

20

phrase is necessarily a limitation?

21

MS. KOVNER:

I think it's -­

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And is that a

23

correct way to characterize your argument or

24

not -- not correct?

25

MS. KOVNER:

I think I might

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

33
1

characterize it a different way.

2

have a clear rule that's derived from just what

3

is a limitation.

4

the dictionary definition is it's a

5

restriction.

6

I think we

And we think a limitation,

So the rule has to impose a

7

restriction under Section 1311.

That -- this

8

rule does that.

9

saying you shall not discharge pollutants into

It is the equivalent of a rule

10

the following locations except in compliance

11

with the terms of Section 1311.

12

So, I mean, there has been a lot of

13

talk of clear jurisdictional rules on the other

14

side.

15

just, does it impose a limitation under Section

16

1311?

17

I think our rule is very clear.

It's

I took our friend, you know,

18

Petitioner to get up and say essentially he

19

agrees with that.

20

limitation and then you look to is it a

21

limitation that arises under one of the

22

enumerated provisions?

23

You look to is it a

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It seems -- it

24

seems more natural to regard the WOTUS rule,

25

though, as not imposing a limitation but

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

34
1

telling you where whatever limitations are

2

imposed, will apply.

3

It -- it is not a specific limitation.

4

It kind of sets the -- the -- the canvass and

5

the rules kind of tell you what -- what that

6

means.

7

MS. KOVNER:

I -- I think they are the

8

equivalent.

They're doing exactly the same

9

thing here.

You could phrase it as it's a

10

definition that tells you where the limitations

11

apply or you could phrase it as just part of

12

the limitation, is it's a limitation that

13

applies only in certain places.

14

And if you look to this Court's cases

15

in DuPont and Crown Simpson, I think they tell

16

you two things:

17

functionally similar rule would have gone to

18

the courts of appeals.

19

first, you look to whether a

And if it does, and I think, you know,

20

I think this -- a functionally similar rule

21

would go to the court of appeals here if it

22

just included the geographic scope in the rule.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, Crown

24

Simpson really was a denial of a permit.

25

think you're trying to get too much out of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I

Official

35

that.

2

In vetoing the state's grant -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- of a permit,

5

it denied those permits.

6

MS. KOVNER:

That's right.

And -- but

7

I think what -- one -- the reasoning that the

8

Court uses is it says, is this functionally

9

similar to a rule that would go to the court of

10

appeals?

11

to a rule that says the effluent limitations

12

that we're promulgating apply in the following

13

places.

14

following places without a permit.

15
16
17

And here this is functionally similar

You shall not discharge in the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What goes -- what

goes to the district court under your reading?
MS. KOVNER:

No, Your Honor.

I think

18

if the EPA promulgated a restriction that said,

19

for instance, you shall not discharge more than

20

a thousand parts per million of a certain

21

pollutant into the following waters, that would

22

be a classic effluent limitation that would go

23

to the court of appeals.

24

And I'm not sure -­

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm asking, what

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

36
1

goes to the district court?

2

MS. KOVNER:

So things that go to the

3

district court include decisions on one

4

particular type of permit, fill permits.

5

Honor's opinion in NRDC lists a number of

6

additional actions that go -- you know, things

7

that aren't effluent limitations but are other

8

kinds of rules.

9

grant-making, rules for certain kinds of vessel

Your

For instance, rules for

10

waste.

Those aren't effluent limitations.

11

those are the kinds of things that go to the

12

district court.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

Well, what is the -­
The most -- it

15

seems to me the most basic question, are these

16

"waters of the United States," if you're -- if

17

you're a farmer somewhere and you don't think

18

these are "waters of the United States," and

19

you go to the district court, they're going to

20

tell you, well, sorry, you're out of luck

21

because you didn't challenge this in -- within

22

120 days of the promulgation.

23

MS. KOVNER:

Well, I think -- so I

24

think if you were challenging whether a

25

particular land was a water of the United

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

37
1

States, you could go to the district court and

2

get a jurisdictional determination applying to

3

the particular facts of your case.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah, yeah,

5

but if you think that's -- the definition is -­

6

is what you want to challenge, not whether the

7

definition applies to your land.

8

MS. KOVNER:

It's -- it's just like,

9

Your Honor, if that farmer wanted to challenge

10

the -- the numerical constraints that applied,

11

they ought to go to the court of appeals to

12

challenge the numerical constraints.

13

Now, I do think there's the separate

14

question that the other side raises of what if

15

there is a enforcement action and you want to

16

contest as a defense in an enforcement action

17

the definition of "waters of the United

18

States"?

19

interpreting exactly the same sort of type of

20

scheme in the Clean Air Act, is there may be -­

21

if there is any due process issue, if that

22

farmer needs to have a venue to challenge the

23

rule as a defense, that's -- that's an issue

24

with enforcement of (b) -- (b)(2).

25

issue with the enforcement of the bar to raise

And I think what Harrison indicates,

That's an

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

38
1

in that kind of challenge.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

know what you mean is an issue.

4

he can challenge it in an enforcement action?

5

MS. KOVNER:

Well, I don't
Does that mean

It means that if there's

6

any due process problem, the appropriate way to

7

address that is by a narrow interpretation of

8

(b)(2), that permits an enforcement action.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, what

10

else do you need to know to tell me whether

11

there's a due process problem or not?

12

thinks the definition is not appropriate -­

13

MS. KOVNER:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

under the statute.

16

against him.

17

not?

He

MS. KOVNER:

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

He's not a

20

lobbyist.

He's a farmer in Kansas.

And all of

21

a sudden, you come in and you're telling him

22

that he can't, you know, discharge whatever

23

into the lake.

24

don't think that's the right definition.

25

you say, well, you should have come to

And -- and he says, well, I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

39

Washington four years ago.

2

MS. KOVNER:

So the Court has reserved

3

in Harrison, in interpreting essentially the

4

same provision, whether there is a due process

5

issue that somebody needs to be able to bring a

6

challenge when there's an enforcement action.

7

If there is, Your Honor, it's not a -­

8

limiting the definition of effluent limitation

is not going to solve that problem because

10

there are inevitably some limitations that are

11

going to be covered by (b)(1).

14

limitations are that are covered by (b)(1) -­

So, if there is

Well, if you will not

16

say whether a person in that situation would be

17

able to challenge it in a permitting -- in a

18

permitting proceeding, then I take your answer

19

to be that the -- the position of the United

20

States is that the person cannot challenge it.

21

That's the position you would take in that

22

situation.

23

MS. KOVNER:

I'm -- I'm not sure, Your

24

Honor.

I don't think we have taken a position

25

on that because the Court has reserved it.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I

Official

40
1

think the cases the Court would look to are

2

cases like Yakus and Adamo Wrecking, and I

3

think it might depend on the position of -­

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I don't

5

understand how you can make the argument that

6

you're making today without knowing what the -­

7

what your answer is to that question.

8

MS. KOVNER:

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

10
11

I think -­
But you won't answer

that question.
MS. KOVNER:

I think the reason, Your

12

Honor, is that -- I think what the Court has

13

expressly said about it is that to the extent

14

there's a due process problem, the appropriate

15

way to address that, the Court said in Note 9

16

of Harrison, is by narrowing the definition of

17

(b)(2), by narrowing the preclusion provision.

18

And that's what the Court would have to do

19

because any limitation that's promulgated under

20

(b)(1) is going to raise -­

21
22

JUSTICE BREYER:

So it says here that

there is a definition of effluent limitation.

23

MS. KOVNER:

Yes.

24

MS. KAGAN:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Ms. -­
The definition of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

41
1

effluent limitation is "a restriction

2

established by the Administrator on quantities,

3

rates, and concentrations."

4

have that in mind, it's hard to agree with you,

5

because it looks as if, given the fact that we

6

have (A), (C), (D), and then (E), which refer

7

to those four sections, it would seem to do two

8

things:

9

you don't -- you want them to issue a permit

Well, once you

(F) says if they issue -- you know,

10

and they won't, to you, go ahead, you can go to

11

the court of appeals.

12

it's fact-based, but nonetheless.

13

A little unusual since

And then the other four that I just

14

mentioned seem to say if there are standards,

15

which are like rules, and they're related to

16

the specific definition I told you about or the

17

equivalent because "standards of performance,"

18

after all, is a different set of words than

19

"effluent limitations."

20

limitations" means something like that.

21

But the "other

And if that isn't the correct

22

interpretation, then what in heaven's name are

23

(A), (C), (D), and (F) -- or what are (A), (C),

24

and (D) doing there?

25

them?

Because you don't need

Indeed, your view, which makes sense,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

42
1

because maybe all rules should be reviewed in a

2

court of appeals, but that isn't what it says.

3

And -- and I am rather stuck with

4

that.

And you say, well, why did Congress do

5

it?

6

were worried about getting review of effluent

7

limitations, or the equivalent, as defined up

8

there in a court of appeals fast.

9

the rest of it, the rest of what the EPA does,

The reason they did it is because they

And as to

10

they didn't care or at least they didn't care

11

here.

Or at least the hearings weren't about

12

that.

Or at least the members of Congress

13

weren't thinking about that.

14

they're left out.

15

All right.

That's why

Now, that's -- that's how

16

I read it.

17

to say that will disabuse me of that reading?

18

And -- and what is it that you want

MS. KOVNER:

Sure.

So let me give you

19

first a textual response and then a response

20

that goes to, I think, what Congress indicated

21

it was thinking.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MS. KOVNER:

24
25

Yeah.

So, with respect to text,

I mean, it says "effluent or other" -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, I know that.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

43
1

"Other" means the same -­

2

MS. KOVNER:

Right.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- roughly speaking,

4

as effluent limitations but in respect to those

5

things that aren't strictly labeled effluent

6

limitations.

7

MS. KOVNER:

So I think -- I guess I

8

would have two responses to that, Your Honor.

9

The first is that's not how this Court has

10

interpreted parallel language in the Clean Air

11

Act.

12

looks at a statute that's a same -- the same

13

kind of list, a bunch of other enumerated

14

actions, and then a "and any other action of

15

the Administrator" catch-all at the end.

16

the Court gives the catch-all its ordinary

17

meaning.

18

Honor is talking about, things like ejusdem

19

generis.

20

So, in Harrison, Your Honor, the Court

And

It doesn't apply the canons Your

And the second thing I would say, Your

21

Honor, is even if you want to apply sort of an

22

effluent-related label I think like Your Honor

23

is suggesting, a closely related, closely

24

connected limitations label, this is the first

25

one in line because this is the limitation that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

44
1

tells you exactly where the effluent

2

limitations apply.

3

as you can get -­

It's as closely connected

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MS. KOVNER:

So, Ms. Kovner -­
And so you have -­

-- and then just to go to

7

what Congress was -- was -- indicated it was

8

thinking.

9

legislative history, it thought it was sending

I think if you look to the

10

most national rules to the courts of appeals,

11

not the district courts -­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Are -­

And if it is that, if

14

it is that, if the -- Learned Hand once said

15

you have to read these things like music.

16

-- and the word "other limitations" certainly

17

doesn't sound like a big catch-all; it sounds

18

like a little catch-all.

19

And

So, if that's true, your reading,

20

though, why did they bother writing this other

21

stuff?

22

there in the court of appeals anyway under what

23

you see as a big catch-all.

24
25

Because after all, they would be up

MS. KOVNER:

Well, I think, Your

Honor, if you -- if Your Honor is inclined to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

45
1

give it a narrow reading, we would say just

2

apply the principles that this Court has

3

applied in other cases to construe how big that

4

exception is, what its scope is.

5

Court has said is avoid the bifurcation of

6

closely related decisions.

7

And what the

And something that tells you the

8

geographic scope of what effluent limitations

9

are is just as closely related as you can get

10

to -- to effluent limitations.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So -­

So, Ms. Kovner -­
Ms. Kovner, you

13

mentioned the Clean Air Act.

But that does

14

have a provision that makes rules of national

15

scope go to the court of appeals.

16

what's missing here.

17

MS. KOVNER:

That's

Your Honor, we agree that

18

this provision is narrower than the Clean Air

19

Act provision and that there are many rules

20

that are going to be promulgated that don't go

21

to the courts of appeals.

22

this as though it said "and any other action of

23

the Administrator," like the Clean Air Act.

24

What we do think it says is effluent or any

25

other limitations under Section 1311.

So we're not reading

Heritage Reporting Corporation

So, if

Official

46
1

it's imposing a limitation under Section 1311,

2

that's all we're saying is what goes to the

3

courts of appeals.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, basically, you

5

agree with your adversary that -- that "other

6

limitation" means any limitation?

7

-- otherwise, what limitations don't exist?

8
9
10

MS. KOVNER:

Is there any

We -- we -- we agree that

it means just the ordinary meaning, restricted
--

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

MS. KOVNER:

Yes.

Of any limitation?
But I think we

13

would also say, Your Honor, that if you were to

14

take Justice Breyer's approach and say it has

15

to be an effluent-related limitation, somehow

16

connected to effluent limitations, we still win

17

because this is the kind of limitation you need

18

to know in order to know where the effluent

19

limitations apply.

20
21

It's as closely connected as you can
get -­

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

Ms. -­
Justice Kagan.

Let's assume for -­

for a moment that your view of any other

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

47
1

limitation is right, that it's quite a broad

2

phrase, but General Murphy, as I understood it

3

-- him, made -- made a point that said, well,

4

still, I mean, there's this under these

5

following sections.

6

And suppose he's right, that in the

7

context of this whole provision, which starts

8

out about "promulgating limitations," that

9

"under" is -- is best taken to mean under the

10

specific authority of.

11

MS. KOVNER:

Yes.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So is -- do you have

13

any argument that this rule was promulgated

14

under the authority of Section 11, or was it

15

pretty clearly promulgated under the authority

16

of Section 1361?

17

MS. KOVNER:

We think it's promulgated

18

under both.

19

interpreting the statute, it's implying -- it's

20

applying, in part, the general rule-making

21

authority provision that Mr. Murphy alludes to.

22

Whenever EPA promulgates a rule

But it's also here relying on the

23

ambiguity that exists.

It's just -- you know,

24

that -- that a statutory term is ambiguous

25

indicates that Congress was delegating to the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

48
1

agencies some authority to resolve ambiguities

2

in the statute.

3

which contains these terms that the EPA has the

4

authority to define under the statute.

5

Here, it's relying on 1311,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Now, in your own brief

6

in responding to some other argument in a

7

footnote, you say the CWA authorized the

8

Administrator to issue the Clean Water Rule,

9

and then you have a citation, and it gives 1361

10
11

as the authority for that.
And that seems, you know, pretty right

12

to me, that you were relying on general

13

rule-making authority, rather than relying on

14

the provision that talked about specific

15

effluent restrictions.

16

MS. KOVNER:

Well, just to be clear,

17

Your Honor, Section -- for everything that we

18

do under Section 1311, every kind of limitation

19

we promulgate or approve, we are relying on

20

that general rule-making authority.

21

I think it's important that Section

22

1311 itself never says the EPA shall promulgate

23

effluent limitations.

24

simply, you know, we're relying on our Section

25

1361 rule-making authority to say we're the

I mean, it's -- it's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

49
1

entity that gets to define what the limitations

2

are going to be.

3

rule-making authority to give content to

4

definitions that the statute, you know,

5

indicated are going to be defined terms and are

6

going to impose limitations.

7

We're relying on our general

For example, you know, other places in

8

1361, they talk about best pollution control

9

technology as defined by the Administrator.

10

Well, I think if we define best pollution

11

control technology more stringently, it's

12

pretty clearly going to be imposing an

13

additional limitation under Section 1311.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why?

Why?

Because

15

if you say, if it's like effluent limitation,

16

how -- you say we need an end because this is

17

close enough -- but it's defined as -- as I

18

said, quantities, rates, and concentrations of

19

constituents which are discharged.

20

Now, how is a geographical regulation,

21

a geographical limitation or expansion, how is

22

that related to, why, that doesn't sound like a

23

restriction on quantities, rates, and

24

concentrations of discharges.

25

MS. KOVNER:

Sure.

It's a limitation

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

50
1

that's very closely bound up with quantities

2

and rates because you need to know the scope of

3

the definition of -- the scope of -­

4
5

JUSTICE BREYER:
point.

6

MS. KOVNER:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MS. KOVNER:

10

12

Yes.
Let's say, a

geographical limitation -­

9

11

Of a discharge from a

Yes.

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- is -- okay, I get

it.
MS. KOVNER:

So, in order to know the

13

scope of that obligation of the limits on rates

14

or points, you need to know where those

15

limitations apply.

16

something you need -­

I mean, it's literally

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

MS. KOVNER:

19
20
21
22

Yeah, I see.

-- to know both in order

to know why you're -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

I see the point, I'll

think about it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I ask you about

23

the mootness problem?

Isn't it so that and now

24

the government is poised to moot this case

25

anytime it wants.

It has -- it has announced

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

51
1

that it is rescinding this rule and go back to

2

the old rule, and it has no disincumbent, and

3

-- and tomorrow it could say no more new

4

"waters of the United States" rule.

5

MS. KOVNER:

I -- I think my friend on

6

the other side's description of the state of

7

affairs is correct in that we've completed the

8

notice and comment receiving phase and the

9

agency is now evaluating that -- those comments

10

that it's received.

11

And it is possible that the agency

12

will, after that, decide, as it's proposed to

13

do, decide to rescind the existing rule.

14

I do think it points up, Your Honor,

15

the sort of practical implications here.

16

mean, for example, the agency received about

17

500,000 comments about the new proposed rule.

18

It received, I think, about twice as many

19

comments, it assembled a 350,000 page

20

administrative record about the old rule.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

I

So

22

just realistically, is it possible this case

23

would be mooted this term or is this process

24

one that innately will take longer than this

25

term?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

52
1

MS. KOVNER:

I don't know the answer

2

to that question.

3

became a possibility that the rule would be

4

rescinded, we advised the Court and suggested

5

it might want to consider holding the case in

6

abeyance to see what happens, but the Court

7

elected to proceed with the case.

8

have any sort of different information now

9

aside from that the notice and comment has

10
11

When -- when -- when it

And we don't

concluded.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Nothing in the

12

pending proceedings addresses the

13

jurisdictional issue that's before us right

14

now, does it?

15

MS. KOVNER:

The jurisdictional issue

16

would arise again, yes, under a new -- so I

17

think if -- I tend to agree that if the Court

18

rescinded the rule that is at issue here, this

19

case would become moot, but the issue would

20

arise again in the context of the new "waters

21

of the United States" rule.

22

And, you know, I think what you would

23

have, to allude to the practical consequences

24

that Your Honor discussed earlier, as this case

25

exemplifies, you'd have people go into dozens

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

53
1

of district courts.

2

reviewing hundreds of thousands of pages of

3

administrative record.

4

Those courts would be

It would get to the courts of appeals.

5

They would do that again with no deference to

6

the initial district court decision.

7

It's really inimical to what this

8

Court indicated in Crown Simpson and in other

9

cases was the purpose of this provision, which

10

is to give clarity.

11
12

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, but, counsel,

under Hertz, we -- we prefer a clear rule.

13

MS. KOVNER:

Yes.

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And if that's the

15

thumb on the scale, you -- I thought you had a

16

pretty interesting argument that, you know, it

17

would go to the courts of appeals and that

18

would be more efficient, until you -- your

19

interaction with the Chief Justice and Justice

20

Alito where you -- you indicated you wouldn't

21

necessarily foreclose district court actions

22

either.

23
24
25

So where does that leave us in terms
of a clear rule?
MS. KOVNER:

Yeah, I -- the Court has

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

54
1

indicated clear rules are important.

2

we have the clear rule here.

3

--

4

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

We think

You just look to

But you wouldn't -­

5

you wouldn't -- you wouldn't stand by that rule

6

when pressed by -- by my colleagues.

7

MS. KOVNER:

Oh, I don't think so.

8

think a person who's bringing a civil suit,

9

absolutely, under (b)(1), has to go to the

10

I

court of appeals.

11

The issue that this Court has reserved

12

is, well, what if you are -- what if you're the

13

defendant in an enforcement action.

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

15

MS. KOVNER:

Right.

Harrison indicates it's a

16

separate question and any issue that arises

17

would be an issue in (b)(2).

18

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So, if we're going

19

to be in district court anyway, what's -­

20

what's the efficiency gained here by your rule?

21

MS. KOVNER:

Well, I think, you know,

22

this case exemplifies when a major rule like

23

this is promulgated, you have many, many people

24

who want to challenge the rule.

25

Here, you had 15 people, you know, 15

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

55
1

parties walk in, and the question is are those

2

challenges going to be routed to a single court

3

of appeals that can quickly resolve, you know,

4

these challenges, or are they going to be

5

considered in 15 different district courts or a

6

dozen different district courts and then go up

7

to the courts of appeals and have that 350,000

8

page record considered anew.

9

We think it's inimical to the

10

objective of obtaining certainty about what the

11

scope of people's obligations are under Section

12

1311.

13
14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I'm sorry.

Perhaps you can focus in.

15

MS. KOVNER:

Yes.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What would be the

17

difference?

Let's assume we say this goes to

18

the court of appeals and the court of appeals

19

says, whatever, the rule is okay.

20

MS. KOVNER:

Yes.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now an enforcement

22

action comes in and someone, some farmer says I

23

don't -- I shouldn't fit under this rule

24

because this really can't be navigable waters.

25

What happens then?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

56
1

Does the court say, well, that was

2

litigated or should have been litigated before,

3

so we're just not going to pay attention to

4

this challenge?

5

MS. KOVNER:

So I think then the

6

question would be, notwithstanding whatever

7

this Court has said about (b)(1), is there a

8

(b)(2) due process exception?

9

That question is going to be a live

10

question no matter what this Court decides

11

about the scope of (b)(1), because there are

12

always going to be challenges that farmer could

13

bring.

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So, in every

15

enforcement action, we're going to be having

16

district courts decide this question anyway

17

eventually.

18

MS. KOVNER:

No, no, I think the next

19

question the Court will need to address, and it

20

will need to address no matter what it decides

21

in this case about the scope of effluent

22

limitations is, is there a due process

23

requirement that in an enforcement proceeding

24

somebody be able to challenge something that,

25

you know, was promulgated through a rule.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

It's

Official

57
1

going to arise on either side's -- on either

2

side's view of what the scope of effluent

3

limitations are.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

5

clause (F)?

6

relating to that?

7

Could I ask you about

What is your textual argument

MS. KOVNER:

Sure.

So I think it -- I

8

think our argument derives in large part from

9

what this Court said about (F) in Crown

10

Simpson, which is this Court indicated the

11

provision should be construed not simply to

12

sort of reach decisions that issue or deny a

13

permit but also decisions that are so closely

14

related that it would be irrational to divide

15

them up.

16

And so then I think it goes to the

17

point that Justice Ginsburg made and what this

18

Court said in DuPont, which is if the

19

individual -- if this decision, when in the

20

context of an individual proceeding would go to

21

the court of appeals and, you know, here, in

22

the context of an individual permitting

23

decision, a "waters of the United States"

24

decision would go to the court of appeals, then

25

it doesn't make sense for a categorical rule

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

58
1

about that to go to the district court.

2

And courts of appeals sort of starting

3

from Crown Simpson have adopted that approach.

4

And so they've said sort of the basic rules

5

that are sort of thresholds to whether you can

6

get a permit or not go to the courts of

7

appeals.

8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:

So the -- so the

argument would be that the definition issues or

10

denies a permit because it has a -- an

11

important effect on the issuance and denial of

12

permits?

13

MS. KOVNER:

It's -- it's a threshold

14

for a permit to be issued that it has to be a

15

water of the United States.

16

decision is made in an individual permitting

17

action, it will go to the court of appeals.

18

And if that

But I do think, Your Honor, looking at

19

that decision, if you look at the sort of

20

functionally similar or identical language the

21

Court -- the Court relied on and said if it's

22

functionally similar then it should go to the

23

court of appeals, it has a lot of relevance

24

under (E) because this is the equivalent of a

25

rule that says, you know, you cannot discharge

And, Your Honor, I do think it's worth

ago.

MS. KOVNER:

Yes.

limitations under Section 1311, then it goes to

JUSTICE KAGAN:

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY S. BISHOP

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. BISHOP:

So the government's just

10

conceded that it's been pushing this functional

11

argument, functional effects argument, for the

12

last 40 years, which is true, and some courts

13

have accepted that and not all have by any

14

means.

15

But the result has been that, for 40

16

years, people have been filing duplicative

17

actions and then litigating about where to

18

litigate.

19

this.

20

where they've spent millions of dollars

21

litigating about where to litigate.

22

to this is to look at the clear language of the

23

statute, which is the only way to get a -- a

24

bright-line rule here.

25

This is the third case I've had like

My clients have had dozens of cases

The answer

And just to -- part of that is the

word "under," Justice Kagan.

15

limitations and other types of limitations that

cut back on what comes out of the pipe but are

17

not themselves effluent limitations.

That is a perfectly clear meaning of

19

20

definition of this type.
