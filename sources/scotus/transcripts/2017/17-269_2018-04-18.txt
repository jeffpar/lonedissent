Mr. Purcell.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NOAH PURCELL

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. PURCELL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
The State of Washington wants to

12

protect salmon and has voluntarily spent

13

billions of dollars to achieve that goal.

14

objection is the unworkable treaty right the

15

Ninth Circuit announced.

16

abandoned that court's reasoning here, but the

17

alternative theories that they offer were not

18

addressed by the courts below and cannot

19

support the judgment.

20

reverse or, at most, should clarify what legal

21

rule the treaties impose and then remand to the

22

district court to apply it.

23

Respondents have

So this Court should

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

mean at least, right?

25

MR. PURCELL:

Our

I think you

Well, sorry, we'd prefer

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
4
1

that you reverse.

2

clarify -- yeah, at most, at least.

3

Sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.

4

better oral advocate on all of this, I'll

5

stipulate that.

6

Sorry, how you want to
Sorry.

You -- you're the

The central question, though, is what

7

legal standard the treaties apply -- impose.

8

And, again, the Respondents have abandoned the

9

rule that the Ninth Circuit advanced and -- and

10

rightly so, and instead they're arguing a new

11

theory.

12

treaties would regulate virtually every

13

significant human activity off reservation, and

14

federal courts in the Northwest would be

15

regulating -- essentially would be imposing

16

environmental laws, would be the primary

17

environmental regulators, rather than leaving

18

most decisions to state and federal

19

policymakers, as should be the case.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But even under that theory, the

In the courts

21

below during the argument in the Ninth Circuit,

22

you said the Stevens Treaty would not prohibit

23

Washington from blocking completely every

24

salmon stream into Puget Sound.

25

right to take fish, to you, means the right to

Basically, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
5
1

take fish if you decide you want to provide

2

fish.

3

Is that correct?
MR. PURCELL:

I -- I remember that

4

answer well, Your Honor, and that was a mistake

5

at oral argument about how our theory -­

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

position now?

8

you block fish?

9

So what is your

When can you and how much can

MR. PURCELL:

So, Your Honor, we

10

believe that to show a treaty violation, the

11

tribes should have to show four things:

12

state barrier is causing a large decline in a

13

particular river and that it's not justified by

14

substantial compelling interests.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

don't know that it's a large decline.

17

it has to be a material decline, no?

18

MR. PURCELL:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

MR. PURCELL:

That a

I don't know -- I
I think

Well, it -­
Every -- every -­

The precise word, Your

21

Honor, we're less concerned about than that it

22

be a meaningful decline, because, otherwise, as

23

I was saying, the concern is that there are

24

many, many things that affect salmon, Your

25

Honor, from zoning decisions to climate change

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
6
1

to transportation, and if you don't set the bar

2

at least at some reasonable level, then -­

3
4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, don't you

think the court below did?

5

MR. PURCELL:

No, Your Honor, the

6

court below explicitly said that Respondents

7

did not need to show anything about the -- to

8

quantify the effect of state culverts on salmon

9

and -- and just said that any diminishment is a

10

treaty violation.

11

why courts applying the treaties will be -­

12

And under that rule, that's

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, it didn't

13

quite do that, because, as I looked at its

14

remedy, it -- it chose not to have you fix

15

culverts that were -- were degradating the

16

fish, but it said they can wait until the

17

normal life of the culvert ends.

18

MR. PURCELL:

Your Honor, that -­

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

MR. PURCELL:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so -­

Sorry.
And it also gave

22

you leeway, rather substantial leeway, 200

23

culverts, I think, or over 200, not to fix at

24

all.

25

your plan and accelerate it.

So what the court does -- did was take
You made the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

judgment already.

2

MR. PURCELL:

Your Honor, the court

3

told us we could defer until the end of the

4

useful life culverts that had less than 200

5

meters upstream of useful habitat.

6

So the -- the -- those are culverts

7

that will make extremely little difference to

8

be replaced, and each one costs several million

9

dollars.

10
11
12

So that's -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And the court

excluded those?
MR. PURCELL:

Well, the court said

13

that those are the ones we could do at the end

14

of the useful -- at the end of the useful life.

15

The court -­

16
17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

means, because if you don't do it then -­

18

MR. PURCELL:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20
21

Yeah, well, that

fall down.

Fair enough, Your Honor.
-- it's going to

So -­

MR. PURCELL:

My -- my point is the

22

court did not exclude ones even where there's

23

another barrier 10 yards upstream or 10 yards

24

downstream that the state does not control.

25

So we have to replace culverts even

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
8
1

where no salmon can reach them.

2

utter waste of public funds and -- and -- and

3

unreasonable even under the Respondents' theory

4

here.

5
6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And that is an

But they gave you

the discretion to exclude those?

7

MR. PURCELL:

No.

The -- the judge

8

said that we could defer culverts blocking

9

10 percent of the habitat.

10

But that -- that -- the problem is

11

that that doesn't -- it measures it in exactly

12

the wrong way.

13

So we could -- we could -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

choice to measure it.

15

MR. PURCELL:

It gave you the

No, no.

It measures by

16

how much habitat is upstream regardless of

17

other barriers.

18

incentivized under this ruling to replace a

19

culvert that has 10 miles of habitat upstream

20

even if there are five downstream barriers that

21

prevent any salmon even from reaching the state

22

barrier.

23

So the state is more

So -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I think your

24

adversaries told me that there aren't hardly

25

any culverts downstream, that virtually all of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
9
1

them are upstream from you.

2

MR. PURCELL:

I don't think they would

3

characterize it that way, and if they would,

4

it's incorrect, Your Honor.

5

our reply brief, at the end of our reply brief,

6

a sample of 315 state culverts; 220 had

7

downstream barriers.

8

it's true that many more barriers may be

9

upstream, but there are still hundreds and

10

We showed in -- in

So it's not -- it's -­

hundreds downstream.

11

And that -- this all highlights, Your

12

Honor, the -- the first treaty point, that the

13

-- the Respondents should have to prove the

14

effect of specific state culverts on particular

15

rivers.

16

over by the district court here.

17

And that just was completely glossed

The -- the fact that a tribe -- each

18

tribe has its own separate treaty fishing

19

rights and its own historic fishing places.

20

And a tribe near Seattle might well be able to

21

show that culverts on a stream near Seattle are

22

affecting its right of taking fish.

23

doesn't say anything about the effect of

24

culverts on the Olympic peninsula hundreds of

25

miles away, where the culvert might be in a

That

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

completely different place in the watershed,

2

there might be different species of salmon,

3

there might be other habitat issues, and that

4

the district court didn't just -- just didn't

5

require at all that -- that type of evidence

6

about the effect on particular rivers.

7

And that's also crucial under this

8

Court's decision in Fishing Vessel, where the

9

Court said that the treaty right of -- of

10

sharing fish is measured on a river-by-river

11

basis.

12
13
14

So -- so it's really crucial that the
analysis be done in that more precise way.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I'm just

15

still having a hard time.

As I understood it,

16

the district -- the district court essentially

17

took your plan of remediation that was going to

18

take 99 years, and it condensed it to 17.

19

it took all of your own studies and your own

20

decisions about priority and what needed to be

21

done on what time level and what studies needed

22

to be done to accelerate what projects faster

23

than others, and gave you the opening to come

24

back and tell them why you were wrong and why

25

something should be deferred or not.

So

And you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
11
1
2

just didn't participate in the injunction.
So why should we remand to do

3

something you refused to do when given the

4

opportunity?

5

MR. PURCELL:

First of all, Your

6

Honor, the Ninth Circuit was incorrect when it

7

said we refused to participate in the

8

injunction.

9

proposed injunction.

The -- the plaintiffs filed a
One week later, we filed

10

a post-trial brief that raised every single

11

objection I'm raising here today.

12

at Joint Appendix 28, it's Docket Entry 663,

13

the -- the -- the filing itself is not in the

14

appendix, but it's available on PACER.

15

16

objection I'm raising here.

17

them at closing argument several months later.

18

If you look

And if

We also raised

Three years passed, and the district

19

court entered the exact injunction that

20

Respondents had asked for, without -- without

21

addressing any of the concerns we raised.

22

so -- so it's just not right; the Ninth Circuit

23

was just incorrect when it said that -- that we

24

had not participated.

25

And

We -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could you say -- could

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1

you say again what -- what you think the

2

standard is?

3

of taking fish.

The treaty talks about the right

4

MR. PURCELL:

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

6
7

Yes.
What do you think that

means?
MR. PURCELL:

Well, it's clear that it

8

guarantees three important rights, Your Honor,

9

this Court has recognized:

A right to access

10

historic fishing places.

11

right of fair share of the available fish.

12

That's Fishing Vessel.

13

free of certain types of state actions that are

14

not justified by substantial public interest.

15

That's Winans.

A

And then a right to be

And -- and applied here, we think that

16

means that the -- the plaintiffs need to show

17

that state barriers are causing a large decline

18

in a particular river and that it's not

19

justified by substantial public interest.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

And what do -- what is

21

the difference between that and the federal

22

government's position about substantially

23

degrading the supply of salmon?

24

MR. PURCELL:

25

Well, Your Honor, for

one thing, it's not -- I'm not -- I'm not sure

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1

whether they would limit their rule to

2

obstructions.

3

important because the parties stipulated early

4

in this case, at Petition Appendix 173 to 74,

5

that that's all this case was about.

6

one potential difference.

7

the briefing here is focused on.

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

9
10

And -- and we think that that's

But as to

this case, which involves -- supposed
obstructions -­
MR. PURCELL:

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Right.
-- that's not a

difference between the two positions.

14
15

It's also what all

All right.

11

13

So that's

MR. PURCELL:

Okay.

I just -- I just

wanted -- that's important.

16

So, second, the way they've defined

17

substantial degradation here, it -- it -- as we

18

explained in our brief, that the highest

19

estimate they gave of the effect of culverts on

20

salmon is a fraction of 1 percent of historic

21

harvests.

22

just -- the treaties become a catch-all

23

environmental statute that will regulate every

24

significant activity in the Northwest, so -­

25

So, if you define it that way, it

JUSTICE ALITO:

So what -- again, what

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

-- they say substantial degradation, and you

2

say what?

3
4

MR. PURCELL:
decline, Your Honor.

We -- we said large
But, again, I'm not -­

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

6

MR. PURCELL:

A large decline.
I'm not being -- I don't

7

want to be picky about the word.

The word is

8

less important to us than the concept that it

9

be meaningful.

And -­

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What does it mean?

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I don't

12

understand what either of those things means.

13

I don't know whether it's substantial

14

degradation or a large decline.

15

MR. PURCELL:

Well, it -- it has to be

16

more than -- than a fraction of 1 percent of

17

historic harvests or 5 percent of recent

18

harvests.

19

decline of half the salmon would certainly

20

easily qualify, but they haven't alleged -- you

21

don't -- I don't think you need to -­

22
23
24
25

We think, for example, certainly a

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, do you have a

number in your head?
MR. PURCELL:

Well, again, I think

that a decline of half or anything approaching

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

half would obviously be a large decline, a

2

substantial decline, but certainly something

3

between 1 and 5 percent is not a substantial

4

decline.

And -­

5

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, 5 percent is

6

often deemed a material number in other

7

contexts of law.

So why wouldn't it be here?

8

MR. PURCELL:

Well, Your Honor -­

9

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

A 5 percent decline

10

in stock price or something like that is often

11

used as a point of reference in -- in

12

securities law, for example.

13

MR. PURCELL:

Several points about

14

that, Your Honor.

First of all, the -- the

15

5 percent was -- we were just saying that's

16

5 percent from very recent harvest levels.

17

that essentially holds against the state every

18

other thing that has reduced salmon numbers,

19

including federal dams and many, many other

20

actions.

So

So, essentially, it's saying -­

21

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, now that's a

22

causation argument as opposed to a materiality

23

argument.

24
25

They're two different elements.
MR. PURCELL:

Fair enough.

I guess

what I'm saying is that the denominator

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

matters.

When you measure from is important.

2

And what the plaintiffs are asking me to do is

3

to say when we file our lawsuit, it's -- it's

4

causing 5 percent of the decline.

5

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Again, I understand

6

the causation argument.

There might be other

7

causes for the 5 percent decline and -- and

8

you'd want to argue those.

9

if they could show that 5 percent is

But is 5 percent,

10

attributable to the culverts, would that

11

suffice to -- to satisfy you?

12

MR. PURCELL:

I don't think it -­

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

14

I'm where Justice Kagan is.

15

your number?

16

MR. PURCELL:

And, if not, I guess
What's -- what's

Well, again, I think,

17

you know, something approaching half would

18

obviously qualify.

19

should suffice because otherwise, again, the

20

range of things that -­

21
22
23
24
25

I don't think 5 percent

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So the -- so the

treaty -­
MR. PURCELL:

-- will affect 5 percent

of the salmon -­
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

-- the treaty, which

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1

guarantees the right to all usual and customary

2

fishing grounds, really means half of them?

3

MR. PURCELL:

No, no, no.

No, that's

4

-- that's not what I mean at all, Your Honor.

5

We're talking about measuring in a particular

6

river what has the decline been.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

I don't even

8

understand why it's -- why decline or

9

degradation matters.

Suppose that there were

10

more salmon than anybody knew what to do with

11

and then there was -- the state did something

12

that caused a decline.

13

a violation of the treaty?

14

MR. PURCELL:

Would -- would that be

I don't think that would

15

be a violation even under the Respondents'

16

theory, Your Honor.

17

that would be, no.

18

that recognizes the crucial other piece of

19

language that -- that is in the treaties, is

20

that the treaties ceded control of the

21

off-reservation land to the future government

22

to regulate in the public interest.

23

I don't -- I don't think
And -- and -- and -- and

And so the government has to have the

24

ability to make some types of decisions, even

25

if they affect the treaty fishing right when

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
18
1
2

there are substantial interests involved.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I guess that's -­

3

for me, I think that's really where the case

4

boils down, and -- and -- and I'm struggling

5

with that.

6

have rights to pursue other public goods and

7

that those can outweigh the treaty,

8

effectively.

9

Right?

You -- you assert that you

And -- and -- and so any violation of

10

these culverts has to be weighed against the

11

benefits they provide to other persons.

12

but -- but doesn't that potentially eliminate

13

the treaty altogether, and doesn't -- wouldn't

14

it defeat it entirely?

15

But -­

The point of a treaty I -- I would

16

have thought would have been to -- to freeze in

17

time certain rights and -- and to ensure their

18

existence in perpetuity, regardless of what

19

other social benefits a later municipality

20

might be able to claim.

21

MR. PURCELL:

Your Honor, we're not

22

saying at all that they outweigh the treaty.

23

We're saying that the treaty recognized -- in

24

the treaty, it recognized that there were other

25

interests, that there were -- the future

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
19
1

government would regulate the off-reservation

2

land.

3

that the parties intended that the tribes would

4

be -­

5

And it's just not plausible that the -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Surely, it

6

allowed -- the whole point of the treaty was to

7

give up land.

8
9

I understand that.

But it -- I don't see anything in the
treaty -- maybe you can point it to me, maybe

10

I'm just missing it textually -- anything in

11

the treaty that says:

12

those usual and customary grounds and stations

13

is limited by, and may be completely

14

eliminated, if necessary, to meet other

15

domestic interests that a municipality might

16

have, which is, I think, the position you're

17

taking, I think, before this Court.

18

MR. PURCELL:

Ah, and your rights to

Not exactly, Your Honor.

19

The treaty right -- first of all, there's the

20

cession language.

21

There's the right in common.

And then, if you look at this Court's

22

decisions in the Puyallup cases, this Court

23

said that the state could completely shut down

24

fishing, if necessary, for important state

25

interests.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
20
1

That case was only about conservation,

2

but the principle has to be broader, like,

3

things like public safety or public health.

Why?

Well, for example -­
Why does it have to

7

be broader?

8

would have been the supreme law of the land and

9

would have overridden any municipal interests

10
11

I would have thought a treaty

and -­
MR. PURCELL:

We're saying it

12

considered those.

13

for example, the state sometimes has to shut

14

down all shellfish -- shellfish harvesting,

15

excuse me, because of elevated bacteria levels

16

in the water.

17

non-Indian shellfish harvesters.

18

It considers those.

And so,

And that affects Indian and

And, obviously, that affects the right

19

of taking fish.

20

harvest any shellfish right now.

21

imagine that the other side would say that's a

22

treaty violation, you know.

23

The state's saying no one can

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I can't

I don't understand

24

what we're -- this discussion.

25

trouble for this reason:

I'm having

I thought that the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
21
1

district court had said -- and I can't get the

2

number -- but that since treaty times, the

3

number of the fish have declined alarmingly.

4

MR. PURCELL:

Yes.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't know what

6

"alarmingly" is supposed to refer to, but I

7

think probably a lot.

8

MR. PURCELL:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
Then in the -­

10

there's a Finding 161 where he says, if you

11

look at the whole watershed, the water -- the

12

-- the -- barrier culverts are accounting for 6

13

to 13 percent of the decline.

14

at the tributaries, it's 44 percent to

15

58 percent.

16

All right.

And if you look

When I read something like

17

that, I thought, well, that's a lot, so I don't

18

have to worry about that issue.

19

MR. PURCELL:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

Now -- now -­

Well -­
-- now you're going

to tell me why I do have to worry about it.

22

MR. PURCELL:

I will.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then I went and

24

looked at what the court of appeals held, and

25

it said we're not -- if there's an act of God

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
22
1

or some good reason, you know, so on and so

2

forth, we're not saying you have to replace it,

3

but we are saying where -- where nothing like

4

that is -- is present, you do.

5

schedule, which is the schedule -- now do I

6

have it all wrong?

Yes?

Okay.

7

MR. PURCELL:

8

have it all wrong, Your Honor.

9
10
11
12

Okay?

On this

You can -­

I don't want to say you

JUSTICE BREYER:
MR. PURCELL:

What have I got?

But you have some parts

of it wrong.
So two things.

Number one, that was a

13

study of a single river and it was a study of

14

all barriers on that river, not state culverts.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah, but, I mean, I

16

can't go back and review -- I can, but, I mean,

17

it's pretty hard to start reviewing the details

18

of a district court record -­

19

MR. PURCELL:

Well, it -­

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- unless there's

21

something that you've told the court of appeals

22

and told everybody else this is clearly wrong

23

and so forth, which I haven't found.

24
25

MR. PURCELL:

But the -- the district

court didn't make any finding that that was a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
23
1

sort of across-the-board effect.

2

citing a study about one river.

3

river, the effect of all barriers, not state

4

culverts, all barriers was 6 to 13 percent of

5

-- of the salmon.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

It was just
And in that

They said that was

7

the whole watershed.

So, apparently, you're

8

saying that if, in fact, I looked at the

9

record, I would discover that you showed it was

10

very much lower -- in fact, that number is

11

wrong -- and, therefore, don't make this

12

finding, and it's clearly erroneous and that

13

the court of appeals didn't consider it and

14

that we should reverse on that ground.

15
16
17

Now I haven't found that in your
brief, I take it.
MR. PURCELL:

That's -- that's not

18

what I'm saying, Your Honor.

19

district court had said I'm analyzing -- I

20

believe that was about the Skagit River -- I'm

21

analyzing the Skagit River, and the Skagit

22

River state culverts are causing 35 percent of

23

the decline in salmon runs.

24
25

I'm saying if the

We're saying that might well be a
treaty violation if there weren't good reasons

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
24
1

why -- if there weren't substantial

2

justifications of public interest for those

3

culverts.

4

And -- and -- but that's not at all

5

what the district court did.

The district

6

court didn't say anything about the effects,

7

other than citing that one study about

8

particular rivers or particular places, and -­

9

and it varies dramatically.

10

I mean, just as that -­

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

12

MR. PURCELL:

But, General -­
-- as that finding of

13

fact shows, the effect in tributaries is

14

dramatically different than the effect in

15

larger bodies of water.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

General, just to take

17

you back to Justice Gorsuch's question, because

18

I think you just gave an answer and it went

19

something like this:

20

30 percent decline and it wasn't for good

21

reason, then there would be a treaty violation.

22

It said if there were a

So now we have a number.

It says

23

30 percent.

But -- but -- but you are

24

continually putting in this, and it has to be

25

reasonless, it has to be unjustified, there

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
25
1

can't be any reason why the state is doing what

2

it's doing.

3

I'm wondering where that is in the treaty.

4

And -- and like Justice Gorsuch,

MR. PURCELL:

Well, I think it's in

5

the -- in the cession language, in the "in

6

common with" language -­

7
8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What -- what language

are we pointing to?

9

MR. PURCELL:

The -- the fact that the

10

tribes ceded control over off-reservation land

11

to the future government to regulate.

12
13

And, Your Honor, if you don't adopt
that -­

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But this is -- I mean,

15

that cuts against you, General, because this is

16

a compact, a contract, made into federal law in

17

which the Indians gave up a very substantial

18

thing.

It gave up all their land.

19

MR. PURCELL:

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

21
22

Right.
And it got something

in return, which is the right to take fish.
MR. PURCELL:

Absolutely.

And we're

23

saying there would need to be very substantial

24

public interest, but at least that should be

25

considered.

So, for example, under the other

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
26
1

side's theory, every single hydroelectric dam

in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But where does this

public interest theory come in in the treaty?

5

I thought this was an agreement.

6

land.

7

-- and let's just even make it narrower here.

8

The right -- I -- I have the right that you

9

will not put up obstructions on these streams

10

I give you my

You give me the right to take fish.

And

such that I can't take fish.

11

MR. PURCELL:

Well, Your Honor, if -­

12

if the rule is narrowly limited like that, it's

13

much less problematic for the state, but

14

there's also not -- the findings would not

15

support that rule, and it would outlaw every

16

dam in the Northwest.

17

inconsistent with the parties' long-standing

18

behavior.

19

So it's -- it's

The federal government built and

20

licensed dams throughout the Northwest for

21

decades starting in the early 1900s that

22

completely obstructed rivers and decimated

23

salmon populations, often over the state's

24

objection.

25

need to show is an obstruction and that -- some

So, if they're right that all you

dams is a treaty violation.

state dams.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now those aren't

They -- they could

-­

6

MR. PURCELL:

We're not -­

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We've had cases

8

that have basically said, the example you used

9

-- if we're going to regulate fishing for the

10

purposes of ensuring that there isn't

11

degradation of fish, bacteria, some other form

12

of fishing that -- that would be more harmful

13

than -- than your catch, we've said that's

14

okay, but if you're going to degradate for the

15

benefit of the landowners, as opposed to the

16

people entitled to the fish, that you can't do

17

that because you have to make sure that the

18

Indians receive their fair amount of the -- of

19

the catch.

20

MR. PURCELL:

Well -­

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So your

22

substantial public need is not creating that

23

difference for me.

24

MR. PURCELL:

Okay.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well -­
It's -- it's not

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
28
1

defining what type of public need is -- is

2

proper.

3

MR. PURCELL:

Right.

And that's fair

4

enough, Your Honor.

5

define that, courts -- the district court could

6

look at factors like those that Respondents

7

have cited under the common law.

8

total barrier?

9

it?

10

We think that to -- to

What are the public benefits of

authorized by law?

11

Is this a

Was it

Those sorts of things.

But to be -- and just is it -- is

12

taking it out going to require a waste of

13

public funds, as many of the culverts here

14

would?

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I'm sorry,

16

if -- if you could have built this bridge in a

17

way to permit the free flow of fish, you seem

18

to be saying that you can get out of that

19

obligation merely because you wanted to spend

20

less money.

21

MR. PURCELL:
Not at all.

No, not at all, Your

22

Honor.

We're -- we're saying we

23

might well -- under the theory I'm saying,

24

there are -- I'm confident there are culverts

25

that we've already taken out that would have

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
29
1

violated this test.

2

you know, they -- they were blocking a

3

significant number of fish on a particular

4

river and there was -- cost-wise, it -- there

5

was no good reason to leave them in.

6

And they -- they had -­

I -- I'm -- I'm not saying we will

7

always win under this test.

8

example, the dams the federal government

9

recently removed on the Elwha River, which will

10

bring back more salmon than all the culverts in

11

this case combined, is the estimate, those were

12

-- probably violate this test that I'm saying.

13

I'm not trying to set out a test the tribes can

14

never meet.

15

I think, for

My point is just they haven't met

16

either this test or -- or even their own test

17

in the -- in the district court.

18

court didn't apply this test because it wasn't

19

before him.

20

that the state's barrier culverts were all

21

obstructions under the theory they're advancing

22

here because half the state's barrier culverts

23

are only partial obstructions.

24
25

The district

He didn't even find that the -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And this -­
Which -- which

test did you say the district court did not

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
30
1
2

consider?
MR. PURCELL:

The -- the idea that -­

3

that -- as I understand their theory here, it's

4

that obstructions that cause a substantial

5

degradation are a treaty violation.

6

the phrase "substantial degradation" doesn't

7

appear anywhere in the Ninth Circuit opinion,

8

the briefing to the Ninth Circuit, the district

9

court opinion.

And -- and

And -- and also, the way

10

they've defined obstruction here is -- is

11

essentially under the common law.

12

common law allowed partial barriers, that's

13

very clear.

14

And the

And -- and that just wasn't at issue

15

in the district court.

So at least half of the

16

barriers that -- that are what we define as

17

barrier culverts under state policy allow many

18

fish to pass, up to 90 -- a barrier can be up

19

to 90 -- sorry, a culvert can be up to

20

90 percent passable and -- and the state still

21

has made a policy choice to define that as a

22

barrier culvert that we are going to remove at

23

some point -­

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

MR. PURCELL:

Well -­

-- but that doesn't make

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
31
1

it a treaty violation.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- the common law

3

cases that we were able to find say things like

4

-- there's a good Massachusetts case here -- I

5

just say it's good because it's from

6

Massachusetts.

7

(Laughter.)

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

But it says that

impeding "the passage of fish into the lakes or

10

ponds, where they by instinct prepare for

11

multiplication of the species" is a nuisance.

12

And it doesn't say that -- you know, it doesn't

13

use a quantitative measurement.

14

MR. PURCELL:

Well, but, Your Honor,

15

as we explained in our reply brief -- and we

16

would have addressed this more in the opening

17

brief had we known this was going to be an

18

issue -- but in our reply brief, we did our

19

best to summarize the common law also -- there

20

are three important differences between the

21

theory they're advocating here and the common

22

law.

23

a barrier was for a public benefit, it was not

24

automatically a nuisance.

25

The common law approved -- did not -- if

Number two, the common law did not

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
32
1

prohibit total barriers.

2

several treatises about that and cases.

3

number -­

4

And we've cited

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

They are -- but he

5

hasn't.

I mean, what's worrying me about this

6

is I'm not sure what the disagreement is.

7

seems to me there is no disagreement, perhaps,

8

on the common law tradition that a nuisance

9

could consist of simply blocking fish from

It

10

coming up a river into your area.

11

seems to me the Indians ought to have at least

12

as much right as a person had under the common

13

law, given the treaty.

14

arguing about what counts as an amount.

15

And then it

And then we seem to be

And when I read through the briefs, I

16

came away with the impression, well, whatever

17

the amount is, there's certainly a lot of fish

18

being blocked by the culverts.

19

now, suddenly here, I think, well, you're

20

arguing, no, no, there weren't a lot.

21

were just a few.

22

deal with that argument.

23

Now -- now -­

There

And I don't know quite how to

MR. PURCELL:

Your Honor, in part,

24

that's because the Respondents have completely

25

changed the theory of the case from what the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
33
1

Ninth Circuit ruled to what they've argued in

2

their -- in their response brief here.

3

it's really only our reply brief that addresses

4

the arguments they're making now.

5

And so

In the Ninth Circuit and the district

6

court, the argument was any diminishment from

7

historic harvest levels is -- is a treaty

8

violation.

9

district court found and what the Ninth Circuit

And that's essentially what the

10

upheld.

11

at least, I'll say at least, at least there

12

should be a remand for application of this -­

13

of this new theory because there's all sorts of

14

evidence that wasn't relevant before that would

15

be relevant now, like the fact about partial

16

barriers, the fact that, as I said, half of the

17

state's "barrier culverts" allow many fish to

18

pass.

19

So what we're saying now is at the -­

And the district court just adopted

20

our list, which we made for good policy

21

reasons, but that -- but it doesn't mean that a

22

partial barrier is a treaty violation just

23

because, you know, 10 percent of fish can't get

24

through it.

25

So if there's -- if the Court, you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
34
1

know, has concerns about the -- the details of

2

-- of the facts and such, keep in mind the

3

district court found liability, of -- the state

4

had violated the treaties, on summary judgment.

5

I mean, the -- the district court held us

6

liable on summary judgment.

7

factual issues essentially don't matter, back

8

in 2007, the whole trial was just about the

9

remedy.

10

So saying the

So -- so, I mean, you know, if -- if

11

the Court disagrees with the rule we're saying

12

here and it wants to adopt some version of

13

theirs, the appropriate course would be to

14

remand with direction to the district court.

15
16

And if I may reserve the remainder of
my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLON KEDEM
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT UNITED STATES
MR. KEDEM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
When the United States promised the
tribes federal protection for their preexisting

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

right to take fish, that included more than

2

just the hollow promise of access to fisheries

3

that could be blocked off and emptied of their

salmon.

5

I'd like to start by taking head-on

6

the state's suggestion that we've changed our

7

position in this litigation, and I don't want

8

to mince words.

9

asked for and did not receive a ruling

The United States has never

11

from their fisheries.

have sought it, but isn't that what the Ninth

Circuit panel did?

And let me run

16

you through what we understand to be the Ninth

Circuit's ruling.

18

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

19

MR. KEDEM:

Please.

If you look at the

20

beginning of the discussion section, page 86a

21

of the Petition Appendix, you'll see that the

22

Ninth Circuit posed the relevant question as

23

follows:

24

it has no treaty-based duty to refrain from

25

building and maintaining barrier culverts."

Whether the state was correct "that

It then spends the next six pages

2

refuting that argument based on the text of the

3

treaty, the understanding of the parties, this

Court's case law.

5

Then six pages later, on 92, the court

6

says:

7

such protection explicitly, the court would

8

infer it."

the infamous sentence in which "moderate

that the very first thing that we asked for was

a declaration -- this is the wrong one -- the

When you say -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- there's an

awful lot in your brief about the common law

nuisance theory supporting the prohibition on

physical barriers.

10

That wasn't presented

before, was it?

11

MR. KEDEM:

No.

That is our evidence

12

in support of what we took to be the central

13

position that we've been arguing this whole

14

time.

15

And our point -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

pretty prominently featured, and it's -- the -­

the state makes the argument that, well, there

are exceptions or what the common law theory of

access to fish is a complicated question.

There hasn't been any evidence

No, Your Honor.

You could

put aside all of the specifics of the common

law.

namely, whether there is any substantive

actions to harm them.

That is a -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And on that basic

12

point, can you explain -- the treaty language

13

gives -- gives the tribes the right to take

14

fish in common with all citizens.

15

MR. KEDEM:

That's correct.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why does that mean

17

anything more than simply what rights

18

non-Indians enjoy, Indians also enjoy?

19

is, you could read it as a provision for

20

non-discrimination against Indians, but you

21

read it as much more than a non-discrimination

22

provision, right?

23

MR. KEDEM:

That's correct.

That

Taking

24

just the words, you could read it as an equal

25

access provision.

This Court in Fishing

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Vessel, however, found it unequivocal that the

2

state was wrong in advancing an equal access

3

argument there, that it provided some greater

4

protection which the state now seems to concede

against harm that substantially degrades the -­

It's because there are certain legal

issues that are not as developed either

factually or in terms of legal concepts as we

The answer is no.

First of all, there are many federal

dams that are built with what are known as fish

ladders.

in to allow the fish to pass either around the

dam or over the dam.

There are some instances where fish

MR. KEDEM:

And, second, that

they did not weigh whatever and however we

I'm still troubled by -­

MR. KEDEM:

to give me a definition of that that would not

So starting first

with substantial degradation, I pointed you to

thing that shows up year after year, despite

The district court didn't use a number

that there is a direct connection between the

get back to -- it was a while ago, but I -- I

6

understood you to say that Clean Water Act

9

MR. KEDEM:

The Clean Water Act permit

10

that we're talking about, the only thing that

11

the state has pointed to, is a blanket permit

12

that's granted in advance, and it says

13

generally that you need to take account of

these things, but it doesn't review individual

particularly.

That's -­

MR. KEDEM:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So you are arguing

10

only with respect to obstructions today, is

11

that correct?

12

MR. KEDEM:

That's certainly all

13

that's at issue here.

14

in theory, you could have some other harmful

15

action by the state or someone else that also

16

substantially degrades the fisheries, but

17

that's obviously not at here.

18

quintessentially, we're talking about

19

obstructions.

20

We are not denying that,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And

And what is your view

21

of the state's right under the treaty to take

22

account of other public interests?

23

MR. KEDEM:

So we would describe it in

24

the way that this Court did in the Puyallup

25

trio, which is that the state can enact

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
47
1

non-discriminatory measures that are aimed at

2

protecting the resource.

3

So, in the example that my friend gave

4

about poisoning of shellfish or other fish,

5

that would be an action that the state could

6

take to reasonably protect the resource.

to be, from my first read, a defense that

there's another public good unrelated to the

resource that might outweigh the -- the

18

problems of the nuisance and -- and diminish

it.

If you look at the very

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

that an obstruction is not a nuisance simply

10

because, on balance, you think it does more

good than harm.

12

Instead, what it says is, and if you

read the cases that support the treatise, that

if there is a way to build whatever structure

you want to put in the water in such a way that

it does not obstruct -- usually, the cases are

We're not also resting solely on the

If I could move to this 1 percent of

I think that's wrong both on the numerator and

on the denominator.

For the numerator, he's talking about

20

a 200,000 fish figure that, first of all, the

district court did not credit and, second of

all, comes from a 1997 state agency report that

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. JAY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
If the promise made by the United

15

States in exchange for millions of acres of the

16

tribes' land means anything in terms of

17

substantive protection of the fishery, it

18

protects against a threat to the fishery like

19

these, a threat that obstructs fish from

20

getting to the usual and accustomed fishing

21

grounds where the tribes have a right to fish

22

and that substantially degrades the fish

population.

24
25

And the idea that the state or a

disregard that based on an agency's or an

2

individual local government's balancing of its

seems to give any substance to this.

11
12

That's not the

So you say it varies from fish species
to fish species?

Well, I think that it -- it

14

takes account of what kind of question you were

15

asking.

16

mentioned the idea that -- that 5 percent can

17

be material in the context of securities fraud.

18

I mean, Justice Gorsuch's question

We are not asking the Court to adopt,

19

you know, the idea that 5 percent is material

20

in all contexts, but we are -- it would be a

21

context -- it would be sensitive to the context

22

of a fishery.

to be something durable; in other words, not

something that is simply washed out in the next

So when you say -­

-- year after year.
-- "materially

9

there's an obligation?

10

MR. JAY:

It certainly can't be de

11

minimis.

I mean, in our -- the parties have

12

not tried to draw the line between de minimis

13

and substantial in this case, I think precisely

14

because the state was litigating the case all

15

along, not on the ground that its culverts were

16

not having a substantial impact, but on the

17

ground that it had no duty to refrain from

18

having such an impact because the fishery was

19

not protected in any subsequent way -­

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. JAY:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't know -­

-- by the treaty.
-- if we can decide a

23

global standard for all of the Indian problems,

24

but the question presented here -- there are

25

three questions:

One, was the scope of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

remedy too much; the second question is whether

2

the government has to contribute in light of

3

its equitable situation.

4

But the first question was whether the

5

treaty right of taking fish in common with all

6

citizens guaranteed that the number of fish

7

would always be sufficient to provide a

8

moderate living to the tribes.

9

question presented.

10

That's the

Now you and the others have argued,

11

and I did -- it is true that the judge in the

12

lower court specifically denied that you -­

13

they were imposing that standard.

14

We're not doing that.

They said:

But they think they were doing that.

16

Maybe they didn't say it, but they were.

17

right.

18

All

What do you recommend we do?
MR. JAY:

We recommend that you look

19

at what the injunction says and affirm it,

20

because the injunction says nothing about a

21

moderate living.

22

on which the injunction rests says, at page

23

263, that the court specifically "need not

24

address what is a moderate living," because -­

25

and, again, now here I would turn to page

The liability determination

2

ruling on what it called a narrow duty -- I'm

3

sorry, "a narrow directive to refrain from

4

impeding fish runs in one specific manner."

5

That is not a moderate living holding.

characterization of the Ninth Circuit's opinion

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

MR. JAY:

In this case.

In this case, the -- as

13

Mr. Kedem walked you through, the Ninth Circuit

14

has two hold -- two pieces of its analysis

15

starting at 1 -- at 158 and it -- and it -­

16

that's not right -- starting at 58 and

17

continuing on until it gets to a place where it

18

says even if the treaty did not make this

19

express promise and even if there weren't the

20

express promises by Governor Stevens in the

21

negotiation, even if we would infer such a

22

promise and analogizing to the Winters

23

doctrine, that is the section from which the

24

state derives the supposed moderate living

25

holding, but -- and we think that the analogy

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

1

to the Winters doctrine actually helps to

2

refute that.

3

The Winters doctrine is a doctrine

4

whereby, when Congress creates an Indian

5

reservation, it doesn't expressly make

6

provision for water.

7

-- to fulfill the purpose of the reservation,

it's inferred.

If water is necessary to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if we were

10

to write an opinion in this case, you would

moderate living standard at issue here?

14

MR. JAY:

We would have no objection

to that at all.

And just so I

we think the Court should focus on is the -­

the actual basis for the injunction, the

and whether the injunction is an abuse of

5

discretion.

What

interpreting the injunction?
MR. JAY:

In interpreting the

12

injunction?

13

injunction was justified in this case is

14

because the state has violated the treaty by,

15

one, putting barrier culverts in the streams

16

that prevent salmon and other anadromous fish

17

from getting to the usual and accustomed

18

fishing grounds, all of which -- all of which

19

are places where the state -- the tribes have a

20

right to fish.

21

Well, we think that the reason an

And, second, those blockages -- those

22

same blockages are what is degrading the

23

fishery in a substantial way.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

And that -­

Do your clients agree

with the United States that the dams that were

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
62
1

built by the United States are in compliance

2

with the treaty?

3

MR. JAY:

So let me -- let me give

4

just a conceptual answer.

5

block fish passage.

6

Kedem said and as is reflected in Section 18 of

7

the Federal Power Act and its predecessor going

8

back to 1906, various executive agencies have

9

had the power to require fishways, you know,

10
11

The -- not all dams

I mean, as my friend Mr.

devices for ensuring fish passage around dams.
So simply saying there were dams is

12

not in any way to say there was an obstruction

13

to fish passage.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah, I understand

15

that, but there are particular dams on

16

particular rivers, and I wonder if your clients

17

have a position as to whether those are in

18

compliance with the treaty, as the government

19

has told us this morning.

20

MR. JAY:

Well, what I can say is that

21

when the federal government has built dams

22

without ensuring fish passage, that the federal

23

government quite appropriately has paid

24

compensation to the Indian tribes in exchange

25

for the destruction of its usual and accustomed

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1

fishing grounds and the inability to take fish

2

there.

3

So, certainly, a dam or another

4

obstruction that blocks a usual and accustomed

5

fishing ground can be a violation, but there's

6

nothing in the record in this case, because it

7

has not been litigated, about particular dams

8

that don't meet that standard.

9

My friend from the state talked about

10

the idea that the state's -- some of the

11

state's barriers are partial barriers, and

12

there are a number of things I'd like to say

13

about that.

14

First is the idea that the common law

15

did not prohibit partial barriers to passage.

16

That is simply incorrect.

17

discussed in detail at pages 17 to 20 of the

18

Law Professors' amicus brief.

19

I think that this is

On page 20, it says it is at this

20

point clear -- this is in the -- in the

21

1800s -- that partial barriers to fish passage

22

are prohibited as well.

23

surprising, because a barrier to fish passage

24

is an obstruction, even if a single

25

particularly strong fish can get upstream.

And that is not

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64
1

Now there's -- I would be happy to go

2

into great detail about what the tests should

3

be, but in this case, you don't have to get

4

into that because the state stipulated -­

5

stipulated expressly to -- to the definition of

6

barrier culverts.

7

injunction in this case is tailored to, number

8

one, streams that are suitable for salmon only;

9

number two, barrier culverts using the state's

And that is why the

10

own definition only; number three, barrier

11

culverts that block a significant stretch of

12

habitat.

13

And it has a fourth safeguard as well,

14

which is that the state can decline to

15

remediate up -- up to 10 percent of the

16

habitat, which we think could add up to more

17

than 200 yards -­

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

But there's still 600

19

-- there are about 600 and something left.

20

Suppose they discover -­

21

MR. JAY:

Five-hundred something.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Because that's a lot

23

of them, when they go out there, that there are

24

like five culverts somewhere which would be

25

unbelievably expensive to change, and,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
65
1

moreover, it would really save only three fish

2

or something.

3

Now suppose that they find that out.

4

Can they go back into the district court and

5

say:

6

in respect to those five?

7

Judge, we would like you to modify this

MR. JAY:

That's exactly what, at page

8

125, of the Petition Appendix you will see that

9

the court of appeals underscored, that the

10

district court retains equitable discretion

11

under this Court's cases, applying Rule 60, to

12

modify the injunction if changed circumstances

13

warrant it.

14

And the -- the court of appeals said

15

that it's confident that the district court,

16

which has supervised this case, these

17

proceedings, and this injunction for a long,

18

long time will exercise its discretion

19

appropriately.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do -- do you think,

21

Mr. Jay, that this -- that these treaty

22

obligations differ at all from the reigning

23

common law principles?

24
25

MR. JAY:

And, if so, how?

I agree with what Mr. Kedem

said, that the common law is a guide to what

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
66
1

the -- to what the treaties' protected right of

2

taking fish means.

3

that it is a guide and not -- not a

4

codification rests in the fact that it is a

5

treaty between the United States and the Indian

6

tribes.

7

I think that the reason

The Indian tribes, of course, were not

8

thoroughly familiar with the English common

9

law, but what the tribes did understand was

10

that obstructions to the salmon fishery were a

11

threat to the continued survival of the -- of

12

the species.

13

had adopted the practice of removing

14

obstructions to permit the survival.

That's why the tribes themselves

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

16

MR. JAY:

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But what I'm really -­

My second point -­
-- asking is when you

18

look at the common law and you look at this

19

treaty, do you see any difference between the

20

two -­

21

MR. JAY:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23
24
25

The -- the -­
-- and where would

that difference be?
MR. JAY:

The principal difference, I

think, is on this point that Mr. Purcell

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
67
1

brought up, the idea that there could be some

2

public interest balancing.

3

agree with Mr. Kedem that that's not what the

4

common law says writ large about nuisance, but

5

it is true that nuisance was a common law

6

creation.

7

Now we don't -- we

The legislature could supersede

8

nuisance in particular instances by passing a

9

statute saying this shall not be a nuisance.

10

The state and locale -- and local governments

11

don't have the power to do that because this

12

right of taking fish is secured by a federal

13

treaty.

14

So it's not that the treaty embodies

15

only a promise that you will have the right of

16

taking fish so long as the state and local

17

governments decide not to abrogate it.

18

Congress can abrogate a treaty with the Indian

19

tribes, and that certainly makes sense, given

20

the exchange that is effected by these

21

treaties.

22

The problem -­

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Only

Mr. Jay, what do I

24

look at?

I know the district court made

25

certain findings about the costs of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
68
1

remediation.

The state has always said it's

2

$2.13 billion.

3

that wasn't true, that, on average, the

4

remediation of 12 or 15 culverts to date have

5

cost, on average, $600,000.

6

MR. JAY:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I know the district court said

Right.
What can I look at

8

to tell me what the cost is projected to be?

9

-- I just need a realistic number, and I wasn't

10

sure I got it from anybody.

11

MR. JAY:

Yeah.

I think, Your Honor,

12

you've looked at the right parts of the

13

opinion.

14

the court of appeals explains why the state's

15

total estimate is "demonstrably incorrect."

16
17
18
19
20
21

I

I would also point you to 119a where

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Six hundred

million dollars is still a lot of money.
MR. JAY:

I don't think it would be

$600 million, I mean, but -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There are 600 -­

I'm on average.

22

MR. JAY:

Right, it's -­

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Six hundred

24

culverts, you're right, he -- he said it was

25

like $650,000 per culvert, so you're right,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
69
1
2

maybe half that.
MR. JAY:

It's still a lot of money.
It -- it is a lot of money.

3

Of course, in the context of the state's

4

transportation budget, in -- at that figure, we

5

think it's about a half a percent of the

6

state's transportation budget.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

some federal money coming.

9

MR. JAY:

But I think -­

And I know there's

There is federal money

10

coming in.

There are -- there are other

11

sources of funding as well that are remediating

12

both state and local and private culverts, but

13

I think that, when looking at the cost, I think

14

what you have to see is that much of the cost

15

comes not from like the designing of the

16

culvert or the -- what kind of culvert you put

17

in but the choice to remediate the culvert.

18

Now -- and it's very important to

19

notice that Washington State has had a law

20

requiring fish passage.

21

general of Washington opined in 1950 -- 1950 -­

22

that culverts installed by the State Highway

23

Department under state roads had to meet those

24

requirements for fish passage.

25

And the attorney

So, if the state decided not to do

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
70
1

that and to install non-compliant culverts,

2

culverts that blocked fish passage, and it's

3

going to cost, you know, a fairly substantial

4

sum to remediate them, the state bears a -- a

5

fair amount of that responsibility itself.

6

Now, ultimately, the district court in

7

its discretion looked at those costs, looked at

8

the state's argument about whether it would be

9

worthwhile, balanced the equities, and

10

concluded that the balance of the harms tipped

11

substantially in the tribes' favor and in the

12

favor of the public interest.

13

And I think that this is well brought

14

out by the non-Indian fishermen's brief, both

15

commercial and recreational fishermen, who

16

explain in detail why it's very consistent with

17

the public interest to resolve this problem on

18

the tailored scale -- tailored timetable that

19

the district court set out.

MR. PURCELL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.

5

I'd like to make three points.

I'd urge

The phrase "moderate living" appears

25

The phrase "substantial degradation"

That was not the argument.

So I raise that point not to emphasize

that -- that they should be barred from raising

2

that argument here but just to emphasize that

3

if the Court's going to adopt some version of

4

that test, really the appropriate -­

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Some -- the sentence

6

says, "in the context of state culverts that

7

appreciably degrade fish passage and interfere

8

with the tribe's ability to obtain a

9

moderate" -- so they have to do both:

One,

10

11

two, also interfere with the moderate standing.

12

Isn't that what it says?

13

MR. PURCELL:

14
15
16
17

That's what they

claimed, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that's what it

seemed to me to say.
MR. PURCELL:

The -- the district

18

court essentially said the moderate living

19

standard -- any decline from that is a

20

violation.

21

they're citing, Your Honor, keep in mind that

22

was after the district court had already held

23

that the state violated the treaties.

24
25

And all the factual findings

The -- the violation finding was on
summary judgment.

And what the district court

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
73

said -- I encourage you to turn to actually the

2

same page that Mr. Jay said, Petition Appendix

3

263a, the district court said, "the tribes find

4

that harvests have been diminished, together

5

with the logical inference that a significant

6

portion of this diminishment is due to blocked

7

culverts, is sufficient to support a finding of

8

a treaty violation."

9

So -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, I -- I -­

understand what the government said to me

earlier, you stipulated that a moderate living

5

wasn't at issue.

6

don't think, as a defense that the existing

to fix the culverts because of that reason.
