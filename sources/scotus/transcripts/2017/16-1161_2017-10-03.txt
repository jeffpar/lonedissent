CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

5

Gill versus Whitford.

6

Mr. Tseytlin?

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MISHA TSEYTLIN

8

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

9
10
11

MR. TSEYTLIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This Court has never uncovered

12

judicially manageable standards for determining

13

when politicians have acted too politically in

14

drawing district lines.

15

science metrics composed of statewide vote to

16

seat ratios and hypothetical projections do not

17

solve any of these problems.

18

Plaintiff's social

Instead, they would merely shift

19

districting from elected public officials to

20

federal courts, who would decide the fate of

21

maps based upon battles of the experts.

22

Now, as a threshold matter, this Court

23

should hold that federal courts lack

24

jurisdiction to entertain statewide political

25

gerrymandering challenges, leaving for another

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

4
1

day the question of district-specific

2

gerrymandering challenges.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I -- I think it's

4

true that there's no case that directly helps

5

Respondents very strongly on the standing

6

issue.

You have a -- a strong argument there.

7

But suppose the Court -- and you just

8

have to assume, we won't know exactly the

9

parameters of it -- decided that this is a

10

First Amendment issue, not an equal protection

11

issue.

12

Would that change the calculus so

13

that, if you're in one part of the state, you

14

have a First Amendment interest in having your

15

party strong or the other party weak?

16

MR. TSEYTLIN:

No, it wouldn't, Your

17

Honor.

And I think the reason for that is,

18

even if it's a First Amendment issue, it's

19

still grounded in the right to vote.

20

And in our country's single district

21

election system, folks only vote in their own

22

district.

23

vague interest in the party that you associate

24

with having more members in Congress, for

25

example, like a Wisconsin Republican might want

For example, you might have some

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

5
1
2

more Texas Republicans in Congress.
But no one would say that you have a

3

First Amendment or a first -- Fourteenth

4

Amendment right in that sort of circumstance to

5

challenge some Texas law that you would, for

6

example, argue led to less Republicans from

7

Texas coming to the Congress.

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but I

-- I think the argument is pretty

10

straightforward which you, in your district,

11

have a right of association and you want to

12

exercise that right of association with other

13

people elsewhere in the state.

14

And if you can't challenge the

15

districting throughout the state, then your

16

claim seems to be -- there's no way for to you

17

to raise your claim.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And this of course

19

-- and this of course confines it to the state

20

and eliminates the problem of out-of-state, as

21

the way the Chief Justice stated the

22

hypothetical.

23

MR. TSEYTLIN:

Well, Your Honor, I

24

don't think it would solve the interstate

25

problem because, of course, the structural

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

relationship of, for example, Mr. -­

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

3

assume that it does.

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. TSEYTLIN:

Let's -- let's

Well -- well, Your

6

Honor, I still think that this Court should be

7

very careful about enacting that kind of

8

doctrine.

9

As we know, race and politics are

10

often correlated in this country, so political

11

gerrymandering claims and racially

12

gerrymandering claims, even if they're

13

ultimately grounded in a different

14

constitutional amendment, will often be raised

15

together.

16

And it cannot be -- possibly be the

17

case that, if there's a showing that the map

18

drawer turned on the racial screen, the person

19

is limited to a single district claim.

20

But if that same map drawer turned on

21

the political screen, then the plaintiff would

22

get access to the holy grail of a statewide

23

claim based on -­

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm not -­
On the question of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

7
1

-- of race, some years ago, this Court dealt

2

with what the -- the so-called "max-Black"

3

plan, said it was a deliberate attempt by the

4

legislature to make as many African American

5

districts as possible.

6

This bears a certain resemblance

7

because the effort here, intentionally, was to

8

create as many Republican districts.

9

max-Republican, it -- doesn't it have the same

10
11

So is

problem that "max-Black" did?
MR. TSEYTLIN:

Well, Your Honor, that

12

turns to the issue of justiciability, and I do

13

not think that raises the same problems

14

because, of course, politics is not a suspect

15

classification like race.

16

And I think the easiest way to see

17

this is to take a look at a chart that

18

Plaintiff's own expert created, and that's

19

available on Supplemental Appendix 235.

20

is plain -- Plaintiff's expert studied maps

21

from 30 years, and he identified the 17 worst

22

of the worst maps.

23

that list of 17 is that 10 were neutral draws.

24

There were court-drawn maps,

25

commission-drawn maps, bipartisan drawn maps,

9

these commissions would not be drawing partisan

11

It is not a neutral method of

asymmetry maps.
The second lesson that this Court

12

should learn from that -- from that list is

13

that Plaintiffs are asking this Court to launch

14

a redistricting revolution based upon their

15

social science metrics.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Before you get too

17

deeply into the merits, which I -- I assume

18

you'll want to do in a minute, can I just ask

19

you a question about standing along the lines

20

of those asked by my colleagues?

21

Suppose that it was alleged that town

22

officials in someplace in northern Wisconsin

23

where the Republicans predominate were

24

discriminating against the Democratic candidate

25

for a legislative district by, let's say, not

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

1

allowing that candidate's signs to be put up

2

along the roadsides, but allowing the

3

Republican signs to be put up along the

4

roadsides, or they were pressuring town -­

5

let's just leave it at that.

6

They're discriminating with respect to

7

these signs.

Now, who would have standing to

8

raise a First Amendment challenge to that?

9

Would it be just the candidate in that district

10

or maybe voters in that district?

11

-- a Democratic voter in, let's say, Milwaukee

12

have standing to raise that First Amendment

13

argument?

14

MR. TSEYTLIN:

Or could a

I would certainly

15

think, Your Honor, the candidate would have

16

standing, and I -- I'm not so sure about the

17

voters in the district, but probably.

18

But certainly, voters in Milwaukee who

19

don't vote for that candidate, they're not

20

eligible to vote for that candidate any more

21

than someone in California is eligible to vote

22

for that candidate.

23

And I think we see this from -­

4

MR. TSEYTLIN:

Would not have

standing.
And I -- I think we see this from the

5

testimony of -- of the lead plaintiff, who is

6

the only plaintiff that testified in this case.

7

He was asked, during his testimony,

8

what harm does Act 43 put on you, given that

9

you live in a Democratic-dominated district in

10
11

Madison under any possible map.
Well, he said, I want to be able to

12

campaign for a majority in assembly, which

13

shows that his injury has nothing to do with

14

him as a voter.

16

17

someone in Wisconsin can have or someone

I think that one could

5

you could have a no longer generalized

6

interest, but we don't have anything like that

here.

JUSTICE BREYER:
do this?

All right.

So can I

Because I think the hard issue in

10

this case is are there standards manageable by

11

a court, not by some group of social science

12

political ex -- you know, computer experts.

13

understand that, and I am quite sympathetic to

14

that.

15

I

So let me spend exactly 30 seconds, if

16

I can, giving you, as you've read all these

17

briefs, I have too, this is -- this is where I

18

am at the moment -- not that I'm for this,

19

react to this as you wish, and if you wish to

20

say nothing, say nothing, and it's for

21

everybody because it's a little complicated.

22

When I read all that social science

23

stuff and the computer stuff, I said, well,

24

what -- is there a way of reducing it to

25

something that's manageable?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

12
1

So I'd have step one, the judge says,

2

was there one party control of the

3

redistricting?

4

say there was a bipartisan commission, end of

5

case.

6

If the answer to that is no,

Okay?
Step two, is there partisan asymmetry?

7

In other words, does the map treat the

8

political parties differently?

9

evidence of that is a party that got 48 percent

10

of the vote got a majority of the legislature.

11

And a good

Other evidence of that is what they

12

call the EG, which is not quite so complicated

13

as the opposition makes it think.

14

other words, you look to see.

15

Okay?

In

Question 3, is -- is there going to be

16

persistent asymmetry over a range of votes?

17

That is to say one party, A, gets 48 percent,

18

49 percent, 50 percent, 51, that's sort of the

19

S-curve shows you that, you know, whether there

20

is or is not.

21

And there has to be some.

And if there is, you say is this an

22

extreme outlier in respect to asymmetry?

And

23

there we have Eric Lander's brief, okay?

You

24

know that one.

25

And -- and we look through thousands

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

13
1

and thousands of maps, and somebody did it with

2

real maps and said how bad is this compared to,

3

you know, the worst in the country.

4

And then, if all those -- the -- the

5

test flunks all those things, you say is there

6

any justification, was there any other motive,

7

was there any other justification?

8
9

Now, I suspect that that's manageable.
I'm not positive.

And so I throw it out there

10

as my effort to take the technicalities and

11

turn them into possibly manageable questions

12

for a response from anyone insofar as you wish

13

to respond, and if you wish to say, I wish to

14

say nothing, that's okay with me.

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. TSEYTLIN:

Thank you, Your Honor.

17

I'd like to talk about the third and fourth

18

aspects of that because I think those are -­

19

I've already talked about the second a little

20

bit.

21

But with regard to the third, which is

22

persistence, that is exactly the kind of

23

conjectural, hypothetical state of affairs

24

inquiry that was submitted to this Court in

25

LULAC in Professor King's amicus brief because,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

14
1

of course, as your suggestion -- suggested

2

steps recognize, a single election doesn't mean

3

much.

4

for any particular reason.

5

A single election, you could have an EG

So you would have federal courts

6

engaging in battles of the hypothetical experts

7

for that reason.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, if I could just

13

stop you there for a second, because I was

14

under the impression that legislators are

15

capable of doing this actually pretty easily

16

now.

17

You know, the world of voting

18

technology has changed a great deal, and when

19

legislatures think about drawing these maps,

20

they're not only thinking about the next

21

election, they're thinking often -- not

22

always -- but often about the election after

23

that and the election after that and the

24

election after that, and they do sensitivity

25

testing, and they use other methods in order to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

15
1

ensure that certain results will obtain not

2

only in the next one but eight years down the

3

road.

4

And it seems to me that, just as

5

legislatures do that, in order to entrench

6

majorities -- or minorities, as the case may

7

be -- in order to entrench a party in power,

8

so, too, those same techniques, which have

9

become extremely sophisticated, can be used to

10
11

evaluate what they're doing.
MR. TSEYTLIN:

Well, Your Honor,

12

legislatures don't have to worry about judicial

manageability standards.

MR. TSEYTLIN:

Well, Your Honor,
They're not all

And let me give you one example

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

2

They're -- they're estimates where you haven't

3

put any social scientist to say that the

4

estimate's wrong.

5

every single social science metric points in

6

the same direction.

You've poked holes, but

7

So there are five of them.

Your map

8

drawer is one of them, by the way, the person

9

who actually drew these maps, and what we know

10

is that they started out with the court plan,

11

they created three or four different maps, they

12

weren't partisan enough.

13

four more maps, they weren't partisan enough.

14

They created three or

And they finally got to the final map,

15

after maybe 10 different tries of making it

16

more partisan, and they achieved a map that was

17

the most partisan on the S-curve.

18

And it worked.

19

they even expected.

5

troubling than the facts in the cases that this

6

Court has previously faced, for example,

with traditional districting principles, which

10

was not true in Bandemer and Vieth.

But they kept

gerrymandered.

involved in the process had traditional maps

15

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIN E. MURPHY
FOR WISCONSIN STATE SENATE, AS AMICUS CURIAE
MS. MURPHY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Plaintiffs have not identified a

24

workable standard for determining when the

25

inherently political task of districting

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

19
1

becomes too political for the Constitution to

2

tolerate.

3

Indeed, the only thing Plaintiffs have

4

added to the mix since LULAC is a wasted votes

5

test that identifies court-drawn maps as

6

enduring partisan gerrymanders and conveniently

7

favors their own political party.

8
9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You've probably

considered the hypo many times.

Suppose a

10

state constitution or a state statute says all

11

districts shall be designed as closely as

12

possible to conform with traditional

13

principles, but the overriding concern is to

14

increase -- have a maximum number of votes for

15

party X or party Y.

16

MS. MURPHY:

What result?
I think if -- if you have

17

something that says the ultimate principle that

18

we're going to follow is abandon all other

19

criteria in favor of partisan advantage, at

20

least you're closer at that point -­

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I don't think -- I

22

don't think that was the question.

It was it

23

satisfies all the traditional criteria,

24

contiguous, but it was a deliberate attempt to

25

maximize the number of seats that Republicans

Heritage Reporting Corporation

would hold.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

This is mandated by

the state constitution.

world where the legislature is required to and

is, in fact, complying with a number of other

7

metrics and is as one of those things taking

8

into account partisan advantage, that you've

9

proven a constitutional violation.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

It's not a -- that's

11

not a manageable standard.

manageable standard that you cannot have a law

other.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, there are plenty

3

areas of law, Ms. Murphy, where we look at

4

intent beyond the face of a statute.

5

know, sometimes that's harder than other times.

6

We understand it can be difficult.

7

understand in other cases it can be easy.

8

we do it all over the place in our law.

9

don't -- we don't say, oh, if it's not on the

And, you

We
But
We

10

face of the statute, we're never going to look

11

at it.

12

So, if your answer to Justice Alito

13

is, well, on the face of the statute, that's

14

certainly a manageable standard, I guess I

15

would ask why not if it's not on the face of

16

the statute?

17

but you have good evidence that there was the

18

intent here, and you have good evidence that

19

the intent led to a certain kind of effect,

20

which was to entrench a party in power.

21

But you absolutely -- you know,

MS. MURPHY:

I think what

22

differentiates this from a lot of other

23

contexts is that here we have opinion after

24

opinion from this Court, dissenting opinions,

25

concurring opinions, plurality opinions, what

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

22

have you, saying that considering politics in

2

districting is not in and of itself inherently

3

unconstitutional.

4

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

5

MS. MURPHY:

So just finding the

6

intent isn't a problem.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Murphy -­

I'd like to go back

to Justice Breyer's question.

11

helpful to get an answer for me on that.

12

criteria would a state need to know in order to

13

avoid having every district and every case and

14

every election subject to litigation?

15

the -- the standards given in -- in the lower

16

court here was, well, a little bit of partisan

17

symmetry problem, a little bit of an efficiency

18

gap problem, not a real set of criteria.

19

It would be
What

Because

And here, you know, is it 7 percent,

20

how durable, how many elections would we need?

21

How much data would we have to gather?

22

through Justice Breyer's question and provide

23

some answers, if you -- if you would.

24
25

MS. MURPHY:

Sure.

Walk us

So I think some of

the problems with the criteria that have been

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

23
1

suggested, in particular with the tests that

2

focus on these symmetry metrics, is that so far

3

the metrics that we have, I mean, they identify

4

false positives roughly 50 percent of the time.

5

And I don't know how a legislature is

6

supposed to comply with criteria that can't

7

differentiate between a court-drawn map and a

8

map drawn for partisan advantage.

9

start with this partisan symmetry concept, you

So, when you

10

automatically have the basic problem that you

11

have to have some way to decide what is the

12

appropriate partisan asymmetry.

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Okay.

But what are

14

the questions -- you know, I need two years or

15

two cycles worth of data.

I need an S curve of

16

a certain shape and size.

I need an efficiency

17

gap of something.

18

are the criteria we'd have to fill in as a

19

constitutional matter in order for a state to

20

be able to administer this?

21

What are the numbers, what

MS. MURPHY:

Well, I mean, with all

22

due respect, I -- I -- I'm not convinced that

23

there are manageable criteria for the courts to

24

be putting on legislatures for how to go about

25

this process.

And I certainly don't think that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

24
1

anyone in this case has identified that.

2
3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But if you could try

to answer -­

4

MS. MURPHY:

But I would suggest that,

5

you know, one of the starting points for me

6

would have to be that traditional districting

7

criteria should matter in the analysis.

8
9

If you have a legislature that has
started by saying we're going to comply with

10

everything that we're supposed to do, not only

11

as a legal matter, but also all of these

12

practical constraints, we're going to draw

13

districts that comply -­

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ms. Murphy, because

15

-- because your time is running out, I would

16

like to ask you what's really behind all of

17

this.

18

stack a legislature in this way, what incentive

19

is there for a voter to exercise his vote?

20

Whether it's a Democratic district or a

21

Republican district, the result -- using this

22

map, the result is preordained in most of the

23

districts.

24
25

The precious right to vote, if you can

Isn't that -- what becomes of the
precious right to vote?

Would we have that

result when the individual citizen says:

have no choice, I'm in this district, and we

know how this district is going to come out?

4

mean, that's something that this society should

5

be concerned about.

I

6

MS. MURPHY:

Well, a -- a couple of

7

responses to that, Your Honor.

8

it's inherent in our districting scheme that

9

there are plenty of people who are always going

10

to be voting in districts where they know what

11

the result is going to be.

12

nothing to do with partisan gerrymandering; it

13

has to do with the geography of politics and

14

the fact that some of us just live in districts

15

where -­

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

MS. MURPHY:

18
19

First of all,

And that has

Some of us, but -­

-- we know that our vote

will come out one way or another.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In Wisconsin,

20

before this plan, was it the case that when it

21

was something like 49 out of 99 districts were

22

uncontested, nobody -- the election was -­

23

wasn't contested because the one party or the

24

other was going to win.

25

MS. MURPHY:

Well, I -- I don't think

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

26
1

you can quite draw that conclusion from the

2

fact there's uncontested races.

3

reality is that political parties have to make

4

decisions about where to put their resources,

5

and they're going to have to do that for

6

reasons that, again, have nothing to do with

7

districting for partisan advantage.

8

to do with the fact that drawing districts is

9

always going to reflect political calculations

I mean, the

They have

10

and it's always going to be driven by

11

communities of interest, and communities of

12

interest sometimes feel very strongly about one

13

political party rather than another.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I have to say that I

15

don't think you ever answered the question:

16

the state has a law or a constitutional

17

amendment that's saying all legitimate factors

18

must be used in a way to favor party X or party

19

Y, is that lawful?

20

MS. MURPHY:

If

I think it's -- on the

21

face of the Constitution as a requirement the

22

district must -- the legislature must comply

23

with, then that could be your instance of a -­

24

a problem that can be actually solved by the

25

Constitution, but it's quite different to me

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

27
1

when you have a facially neutral districting

2

matter -­

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is that an equal

4

protection violation or a First Amendment

5

violation?

6

MS. MURPHY:

Well, it's a little hard

7

to say at this point because, you know, it

8

really just hasn't been fully explored, this

9

concept of how you would come at all of this

10

from a First Amendment perspective.

11

this comes back to really the standing question

12

--

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think

Well, you said

14

there's a Constitution -- is it equal

15

protection?

16

MS. MURPHY:

I think the question -- I

17

mean, it would be who has standing to bring

18

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
standing.

Well, assume

I'd like an answer to the question.
MS. MURPHY:

Yes.

It would be an

22

unconstitutional if it was on the face of it,

23

and I think that that would be better thought

24

of probably as an equal protection violation,

25

but you could think of it just as well, I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

28
1

think, as a First Amendment violation in the

2

sense that it is viewpoint discrimination

3

against the individuals who the legislation is

4

saying you have to specifically draw the maps

in a way to injure, but, again, I -­

what the value is to democracy from political

system of government?

How -- how does that help our

MS. MURPHY:

Sure.

Well, I would

point to -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You -- you almost

13

concede that it doesn't when you say if a state

14

filed -- has a constitutional amendment or has

15

a law that says you must comply with

16

traditional criteria, but you must also

17

politically gerrymander, you're saying that

18

might be unconstitutional?

19

MS. MURPHY:

It might be, but I don't

20

think that necessarily means that districting

21

for partisan advantage has no positive values.

22

I would point you to, for instance, Justice

23

Breyer's dissenting opinion in Vieth which has

24

an extensive discussion of how it can actually

25

do good things for our system to have districts

Heritage Reporting Corporation

drawn in a way that makes it easier for voters

2

to understand who they are account -- who the

legislature is.

5

people understand who isn't and who is in

power.

It produces values in terms of

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

understand how any of that -- what that means.

I mean, it -- it's okay to stack the decks so

10

that for 10 years or an indefinite period of

11

time one party, even though it gets a minority

12

of votes, can't get a minor -- gets a minority

13

of votes, can get the majority of seats?

14

MS. MURPHY:

With all due respect, you

15

know, I would certainly dispute the premise

16

that the decks are stacked here.

17

the day, what matters is how people vote in

18

elections and that's what's going to determine

19

the outcomes, as it has in Wisconsin where the

20

Republicans have won majorities because they've

21

actually won the majority of the vote in most

22

of the elections over the past four years.

Mr. Smith.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
What the state is asking for here is a

7

free pass to continue using an assembly map

8

that is so extreme that it effectively

9

nullifies democracy.

10

As this case illustrates, it's now

11

possible even in a 50/50 state like Wisconsin

12

to draw a district map that is so reliably and

13

extremely biased that it effectively decides in

14

advance who's going to control the legislative

15

body for the entire decade.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Maybe we can

17

just talk briefly about the standing issue.

18

It is a little arresting to have a

19

rule that we establish that when your claim is

20

racial gerrymandering, it has to be limited to

21

your district, you can't complain about racial

22

gerrymandering elsewhere in the state, but

23

here, if the claim is going to be political

24

gerrymandering, you can raise claims about

25

whole statewide issues even if there is no

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

31
1

argument that you're gerrymandered, like the

2

first plaintiff who votes in Madison, his vote

3

isn't diluted in any way, and yet he is able to

4

complain about voting anywhere in the state.

5

MR. SMITH:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I

6

think that standing has to follow from the

7

nature of the injury and that follows from the

8

nature of the constitutional violation.

9

A racial gerrymandering claim, a Shaw

10

v. Reno claim, is an attack on a particular

11

district for being drawn with excessive focus

12

on race.

13

be localized to the place where that district

14

is.

15

In that situation, the injury has to

Partial -- partisan gerrymandering has

strength of his vote for the state-wide

3

purposes.

5

Is he really have standing to

MR. SMITH:

Well, Your Honor, I think

6

you could decide that while it might have some

7

de minimis effect on the interest of any

8

Democrat attempting to carry out that group's

9

political agenda, that it's sufficiently de

10

minimis that you wouldn't want to give standing

11

to people outside the directly affected area.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why -- why is it de

13

minimis?

14

thing.

15

to many towns that are controlled by the

16

Republicans and they're taking down all the

17

Democratic signs.

18

strategy, it will mean fewer members of the

19

legislature are Democrats and, therefore, the

20

interests of the Democratic voter in Milwaukee

21

or Madison will be impaired.

22

exactly the same thing.

23

It seems to me it's exactly the same
If you have a system, let's extend it

And if that's an effective

MR. SMITH:

It seems like

Well, Your Honor, if you

24

had a systematic effort in a lot of places by

25

members of one party to prevent the other party

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

33
1

from campaigning effectively, I think that

2

anybody in the Democratic Party in the state

3

would have standing.

4
5

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

Well, on

the -- let's -- let's look at the race issue.

6

So you have a state where there you

7

have an African American voter in -- in a -- in

8

one part of the state who wants to complain

9

that districts in another part of the state are

10

-- are packed or cracked and, as a result of

11

that, there are going to be fewer African

12

Americans in the legislature than there should

13

be.

14

And that's going to impair that

15

person's interests, including, I would suppose,

16

their right of association.

17

the difference between those two situations?

18

MR. SMITH:

What -- what is

Well, Your Honor, that's a

19

Section 2 vote dilution claim, and I think that

20

the law appropriately limits standing in that

21

situation to people who live in the region of

22

the state where there's an absence of an

23

additional minority district.

24
25

You wouldn't want to assume that some
African American from a different part of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

34
1

state has a collective interest with people

2

over here in this part of the state just

3

because of race.

4

But with party, people join the party to -- to

5

work together to achieve a collective end.

6

you're not -­

7

That's just stereotyping.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So

Well, but

8

that's equally stereotyping.

Sometimes people

9

vote for a wide variety of reasons.

Maybe the

10

candidate, although he's of a different party,

11

is a -- is a friend, is a neighbor.

12

think it's a good idea to have the

13

representatives from their district to balance

14

out what they view would be necessary -- likely

15

candidates from other districts.

16

MR. SMITH:

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Maybe they

Maybe they do -­
I don't think

18

it's any more -- any less stereotypical to say

19

that people are going to vote for parties

20

because they support everything the party does

21

statewide.

22

MR. SMITH:

Well, but to have

23

standing, I think you'd want to find plaintiffs

24

who do that, Your Honor.

25

plaintiffs we have here are thorough going

And certainly the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

35

supporters of the disfavored party.

Their

party has been punished by the law of the State

of Wisconsin.

standing issue ought to be satisfied by the

5

description of what our claim is, which comes

6

right out of Justice Kennedy's concurrence in

7

Vieth where -- this is on page 86-A of the

8

jurisdictional statement, The White Appendix.

9

It's just a two-sentence description

And I think that the -- the

10

of our claim:

11

where a state enacts a law that has the purpose

12

and effect of subjecting a group of voters or

13

their party to disfavored treatment by reason

14

of their views.

15

gerrymandering, that means that First Amendment

concerns arise where an apportionment has the

18

voters' representational rights."

way that it's been handled ever since the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And why is that, and

does it -- is it an analogy to this case?

13

MR. SMITH:

Well, it's certainly a

going to follow an example of one of my

4

I can what -- what is the main problem for me

5

and give you an opportunity to address it.

6

I would think if these -- if the claim

7

is allowed to proceed, there will naturally be

8

a lot of these claims raised around the

9

country.

10

Politics is a very important driving

force and those claims will be raised.

That doesn't sound

Your Honor, first thing I

19

would say in response to that is that those

20

challenges are already being brought.

21

gerrymandered maps get challenged -- they get

22

challenged in other ways, under the one person,

23

one vote doctrine, under the racial

24

gerrymandering doctrine, under Section 2.

And

Most of

the -- the statewide redistricting maps in this

2

country are challenged every 10 years in some

3

way or another.

4

What -- what would make the system

5

work better is if people could bring a

6

challenge to what they actually think is wrong

7

with the map, which is that it's anti­

8

democratic, it decides in advance that one

9

party is going to control the state government

10

for 10 years and maybe for 20 years because

11

they can replicate it at the end of the 10

12

years and do it again.

13

That is the real problem.

And I think

14

what -- what the Court needs to know is it's -­

15

this is a cusp of a really serious, more

16

serious problem as gerrymandering becomes more

17

sophisticated with computers and data analytics

18

and a -- and an electorate that is very

19

polarized and more predictable than it's ever

20

been before.

21

this is -- we're not going to have a judicial

remedy for this problem, in 2020, you're going

because if party A wins a majority of votes,

party A controls the legislature.

fair.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And if you

9

need a convenient label for that approach, you

10

can call it proportional representation, which

11

has never been accepted as a political

12

principle in the history of this country.

13

MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, we are not

14

arguing for proportional representation.

15

are arguing for partisan symmetry, a map which

16

within rough bounds at least treats the two

17

parties relatively equal in terms of their

18

ability to translate votes into seats.

19

That's -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We

That sounds

exactly like proportional representation to me.

22

MR. SMITH:

Proportional

23

representation is when you give the same

24

percentage of seats as they have in percentage

25

of votes.

That's what proportional

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

42
1

representation means.

2

simply doesn't remotely do that.

3

party A at 54 percent gets 58 percent of the

4

seats, party B when it gets 54 percent ought to

5

get 58 percent of the seats.

6

And our -- our claim

That's symmetry.

That's what the political scientists

the scale.

something that's manageable and it has to be

something that's sufficiently concrete so that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

judges, scholars, legal scholars, political

2

scientists have been looking for a manageable

3

standard.

4

All right.
In 2014, a young researcher publishes

5

a paper, Eric McGhee publishes a paper, in

6

which he says that the measures that were

7

previously -- the leading measures previously,

8

symmetry and responsiveness, are inadequate.

9

But I have discovered the key.

I have

10

discovered the Rosetta stone and it's -- it is

11

the efficiency gap.

12

And then a year later you bring this

13

suit and you say:

14

constitutional standard.

15

after 200 years, it's been finally discovered

16

in this paper by a young researcher, who

17

concludes in the end -- this is the end of his

18

paper -- after saying symmetry and

19

responsiveness have shown to be -- looked to be

20

inappropriate, "The measure I have offered

21

here, relative wasted votes, is arguably" -­

arguably -- "a more valid and flexible measure

It's full of questions.

One of the judges in the court below

asks:

Why do you calculate EG by map, by

subtracting from the votes obtained by the

16

winner, 50 percent of the votes, instead of the

17

votes obtained by the runner up?

18

Mr. McGhee says:

19

this, and I have a forthcoming paper and I'll

answer it in the forthcoming paper.

Well, I have an answer to

Your Honor?
JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah, there is a

There are about 10 of them.

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. SMITH:

I would say this if I

6

might, Justice Alito.

In Vieth, the Court

7

appropriately laid down a challenge and said if

8

you want us to do this, you've got to give us a

9

lot more than you've given us.

You've got to

10

give us two things, a substantive definition of

11

fairness and a way to measure it so we can

12

limit judicial intervention to the really

13

serious cases, and so we won't have the Court

14

entering into the political fray all the time,

15

but we'll have standards that say you go this

16

far, we're going to go -- we're going to go

17

after you, but in the meantime, anything less

18

serious than that, we're going to leave to the

19

political branches.

20

And so the social scientists stepped

21

up and said we have three different ways to

22

calculate asymmetry, not just one:

23

median-mean measure; the partisan bias measure,

24

where you're equalizing to 50/50; and the -­

25

the efficiency gap.

the

And in this case, they all

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

46
1

come to the exact same conclusion that this is

2

one of the most extreme gerrymanders ever drawn

3

in -- in living memory of the United States,

4

one of the five worst out of the 230 maps that

5

Professor Jackman studied.

6

And so there is no -- there's no

7

question here about this being the -­

8

maximizing one party control as far as they

9

could go.

As Justice Sotomayor was saying,

10

they pushed the limits and pushed the limits

11

and pushed the limits.

JUSTICE KAGAN:
I'm sorry.

And it -­
Mr. Smith, may I -­

Please.

MR. SMITH:

Please go ahead, Your

Honor.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

I -- I think that this

17

symmetry idea is both an intuitive and an

18

attractive principle.

19

question was do you have a substantive

20

principle, I actually think you do.

21

So, if the first

The second question is, is there

22

ways -- are there ways to make sure that not

23

every district is subject to challenge as

24

violating that principle?

25

hear you talk about that.

And so I'd like to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

47

How is it that we are not going to

2

create a world in which in every district

3

somebody can come in and say:

4

been a violation of partisan symmetry; we're

5

entitled to a redrawn map?

6
7

What's the threshold?

A-ha, there's

Where do you

draw the line?

8

MR. SMITH:

Well, the -­

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Because this -- this

10

-- it seems to me that this map goes over

11

pretty much every line you can name.

12

MR. SMITH:

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

14
15

That's true.
But where do you draw

the line in another case and another case?
MR. SMITH:

Well, Justice Kagan, the

16

great virtue of these three different measures,

17

none of which were presented to the Court in

18

Vieth when I argued the Vieth case -- and I

19

didn't do a very good job -- is that they each

20

allow you to assign a number to each

21

gerrymander and that allows you to compare them

22

across the country and back in history.

23

therefore, it is possible to draw a line.

24
25

And,

Now, in addition to just measuring the
degree of asymmetry, the other thing that's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

48
1

important to do is to measure the likelihood of

2

durability of that asymmetry.

3

with the sensitivity testing so you make sure

4

you don't have the kind of map that, with a

5

small swing of voting over the next decade, is

6

going to flip over, as the map in Pennsylvania

7

in Vieth actually did.

8

right tests, the ones that I'm now presenting

9

to you, we wouldn't have won that case in -- in

10

And you do that

That -- if we had the

2004.

11

But this map is never going to flip

12

over.

The evidence is unequivocal that the

13

Democrats would have to have an earthquake of

14

unprecedented proportions to even have a chance

15

to get up to 50 votes out of 99.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

All of those

17

predictions -- I mean, Bandemer predicted the

18

Democrats would never be able to attain a

19

majority.

20

they got a majority the one after that.

And they won every

Predicting on the basis of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

49
1

statistics that are before us has been a very

2

hazardous enterprise.

3

MR. SMITH:

The technique of

4

sensitivity testing, which was done by the

5

Defendants' expert in the -- in the process of

6

drawing the map to make sure that they were

7

drawing a permanent, non-flippable gerrymander,

8

and then done again by the experts for the

9

Plaintiffs in this case in court and tested by

10

the court, is a -- a method by which you

11

identify one thing about the map:

12

a lot of swing districts in it, a lot of

13

competitive districts in it?

14

does, you can have a map that looks very biased

15

in one year when all those districts go one

16

way, but it might flip over.

17

Bandemer.

18

Does it have

Because if it

That was

That was Vieth.
That is not this case.

They spent

19

their entire time in that -- those four months

20

in that locked room doing two things, trying to

21

maximize the amount of bias and eliminating

22

systematically competitive districts, reducing

23

it down to something less than 10 when it had

24

been up around 20, and then even though those

25

10, they tinkered with it and tinkered with it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

to make sure that even of that 10, they thought

2

they could get at least seven.

getting eight and then eventually all 10.

So are you suggesting

that we should be looking for outliers or are

8

you suggesting that we should be trying to

filter out all manner of partisan

consideration, or is it someplace in between?

11

MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, the word

12

"outlier" is probably an appropriate one.

13

Certainly, we don't think -- and we've followed

14

the lead of this Court in Justice Kennedy's

15

concurrence and other decisions of this Court

16

-- that all partisanship is unconstitutional.

17

What you need is a method by which the

18

extreme gerrymander, the one that is

19

fundamentally anti-democratic and is going to

20

last for the full decade, can be identified and

-- and held unconstitutional.

here.

efficiency gap, by the other two tests that I

mentioned.

-- so that doesn't

to know how to -- what they're supposed to do

to avoid the kind of litigation we're talking

about.

itself, and tell me if I'm wrong, that it would

yield about a third of all the districts in the

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

As I understand the efficiency gap test

Not true.

Not true.

Now, that's what the

19

other side says.

20

and tell me what test you'd have this Court

21

adopt.

22

So tell me where that's wrong

MR. SMITH:

Well, first of all, I -- I

23

would go with the -- the screens that Justice

24

Breyer mentioned, the first one being it has to

25

be a one-party state.

That one-third figure

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

53

they keep throwing around ignores the fact that

2

a number of those maps were drawn either by

commissions or by courts or by divided

legislatures.

And so they get -- those all get taken

off the table from the very beginning.

measure whether it's unusually asymmetrical,

pretty extreme, and we -­

18

20

Any of them?

Yes.

three?
MR. SMITH:

And if they don't -- I -­

I would suggest you apply all of them, and -­

21

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

22

MR. SMITH:

All of them?

-- if they disagree, that

23

would -- that would tell you maybe this isn't

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Just on that, isn't it

7

true that you could -- you can get very high

8

levels of -- very high EG based on factors that

9

have nothing to do with gerrymandering?

10

the political geography can lead to it;

11

protection of incumbents, which has been said

12

to be a legitimate factor, can lead to a high

13

EG; compliance with the Voting Rights Act can

14

affect that?

15

MR. SMITH:

The -­

Certainly, there are

16

various factors that -- that -- other than

17

partisan bias that can lead you to draw a map

18

that does not have a zero EG.

19

In our test, with the intents

20

requirement, the effects requirement, and the

21

justification requirement, all of those

22

problems are taken care of either at the intent

23

stage or at the justification stage.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

How are they taken

care of at the justification stage?

The

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

55
1

proposal is to run many -- you know, millions

2

of -- of alternative maps to see whether using

3

some traditional districting requirements, you

4

can produce a map that has a lower -- a lower

5

EG.

6

done, those maps do not take into account

7

either incumbent protection or compliance with

8

the Voting Rights Act, both of which can have a

9

very big effect.

10
11

But my understanding is that when that's

It's just one of the dozens

of uncertainties about this whole process.
MR. SMITH:

Actually, they do -- they

12

do take into account the Voting Rights Act.

13

The Chen study that was discussed in one of the

14

amicus briefs and is discussed somewhat in the

15

merits briefs here, where they -- he produced

16

200 randomly generated maps of Wisconsin using

17

all the state's traditional criteria, he

18

started with the minority districts that were

19

already drawn by the state in Act 43 and kept

20

those in place.

21

And so then he generated -- randomly

22

generated maps, and he found that the degree of

23

bias created by the political geography in

24

Wisconsin is minute, modest, a little bit,

25

something -- just like what the District Court

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

56
1

found, maybe 1 or 2 percent, not even remotely

2

like what they have in the map.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And so -­

Would it be fair to

4

require plaintiffs to provide those maps, many,

5

many of them, so that one can tell whether the

6

actual map is an outlier?

technologies are there, they will be in the

record in almost every case.

generating random maps that teach you a lot of

So, for an example,

that becomes a way to filter out the effects of

geography from the effects of partisan

10

advantage?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor.

I would

12

say that at the remedy stage, if they -- if

13

they come back with a remedy map that matches

14

the sort of neutral geography, even if it's

15

somewhat favorable to the -- the party that's

16

in charge, that should be okay.

17

have to go to zero just to -- at the remedy

18

stage, but they have to come up with something

19

much less extreme than their intentional

20

gerrymandering, one that basically makes

basically, gerrymanders now are not your

that exactly what you're trying to do, though?

20

MR. SMITH:

No.

21

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

You're saying it's a

22

one-party rule and that would violate a

23

republican form of government guarantee.

24

Wouldn't that be the more specific

25

constitutional provision to look to, rather

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

than the generic equal protection clause?

2

MR. SMITH:

Well, I -­

3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

For that matter,

4

maybe we can just for a second talk about the

5

arcane matter, the Constitution.

6

And where exactly do we get authority

7

to revise state legislative lines?

8

when the Constitution authorizes the federal

9

government to step in on state -- state

10

legislative matters, it's pretty clear.

11

look at the Fifteenth Amendment, you look at

12

the Nineteenth Amendment, the Twenty-Sixth

13

Amendment, and even the Fourteenth Amendment,

14

Section 2, says Congress has the power, when

15

state legislators don't provide the right to

16

vote equally, to dilute congressional

17

representation.

18

indications in the Constitution itself that

19

maybe we ought to be cautious about stepping in

20

here?

21

When -­

If you

Aren't those all textual

MR. SMITH:

Well, I don't think

22

there's anything unusual about using the First

23

Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment to

24

regulate the abusive management of state

25

elections by state government.

That's what the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

61

Court has been doing.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Where did

one-person/one-vote come from?

4

MR. SMITH:

That's what Reynolds

5

versus Sims and Baker versus Carr did and a

6

number of other cases that have followed along

7

since.

8

conceivably regulate this problem under the

9

Fourteenth Amendment does not mean that the

10

And the fact that Congress could

Court should not.

11

There's a number of cases, the term

12

limits case, Cook versus Gralike, where

13

Congress could have used the elections clause

14

to fix a problem, but the Court said, well, in

15

the absence of Congressional action, we're -­

16

we're going to regulate an abusive, a misuse of

17

the power to run federal elections, and in this

18

case, it's state elections, you'd have to rely

19

on, Congress would have to rely on Section 5 of

20

the Fourteenth Amendment, and maybe they could

21

in theory, but this is a problem which -­

22

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Do you see any

23

impediment to Congress acting in this this

24

area?

25

MR. SMITH:

Other than the fact that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

62
1

politicians are never going to fix

2

gerrymandering.

They like gerrymandering.

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. SMITH:

This is -- the problem in

5

this area is if you don't do it, it's locked

6

up.

7

the ballot without the legislature's consent.

8

And that's true in most of the states that

9

don't have commissions now.

The voters of Wisconsin can't get it on

10

And so you have -- we're here telling

11

you you are the only institution in the United

12

States that can do -- that can solve this

13

problem just as democracy is about to get worse

14

because of the way gerrymandering is getting so

15

much worse.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

You -- you paint a

17

very dire picture about gerrymandering and its

18

effects, but I was struck by something in the

19

seminal article by your expert, Mr. McGhee, and

20

he says there, "I show that the effects of

21

party control on bias are small and decay

22

rapidly, suggesting that redistricting is at

23

best a blunt tool for promoting partisan

24

interests."

25

So he was wrong in that.

He's right

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

63
1

with the EG.

That's the Rosetta Stone, but

2

he's wrong in that.

3

MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, I'd have to

4

see what that sentence is saying in context.

5

I'm quite confident Mr. McGhee does not think

6

that redistricting is not a -- is a non-problem

7

or that -­

JUSTICE ALITO:
said.

10
11

MR. SMITH:
is a non-problem.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY MISHA TSEYTLIN
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. TSEYTLIN:

I'd like to begin by

answering Justice Kennedy's question.
A facially discriminatory law in a

21

state would violate the First Amendment because

22

it would stigmatize that party.

23

this Court's cases could not be clearer that

24

when you have neutral lines -- neutrally,

25

facially neutral lines, the question is not of

This case -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

64
1

partisan intent, because there will always be

2

partisan intent.

3

The question is have the Plaintiffs

4

presented a -- a burden on representational

5

rights based upon a limited, precise,

6

judicially amenable standard.

7

nothing new presented to this Court.

8
9

There has been

Basically, what the Plaintiffs have
done here is they've taken Professor King's

10

amicus brief from LULAC, they have taken the

11

exact same central concept, partisan asymmetry,

12

and they've recycled it here.

13

new before this Court.

14

There is nothing

Second, we've heard something about

15

the various tests that they're now proposing.

16

There was only one test that was subjected to

17

adversarial scrutiny in this case, in a

18

four-day trial.

19

proved so fatally flawed that the District

20

Court rejected it as the test and Plaintiffs

21

abandoned it as the primary test on appeal.

22

That efficiency gap test

And then my final point about the

23

scare tactics, about what will happen next.

24

Plaintiff's expert did a comprehensive study

25

from 1972 at the -- when the Baker

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

65
1

redistricting had happened, to 2014.

2

and you can look at that study.

3

that study is on Supplemental Appendix 227.

4

The chart on

It shows that the asymmetry was worse,

5

was worse in 1972 than in 2014.

6

going to have scare tactics.

7

going to have partisan intent.

8
9

And he -­

You're always

You're always

We have not had any advancement in
terms of what has been presented to this Court

10

since LULAC, where this Court properly

11

criticized partisan asymmetry as not a neutral

12

standard that has uniform acceptance.

13

And we are asking for those reasons

14

for this Court to reverse the District Court.

15

Thank you, Your Honors.
