the United States.

Mr. Shumsky.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SHUMSKY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. SHUMSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The plurality and the concurrence in

12

Freeman recognized two ways that a sentence

13

following a C-type agreement can be based on

14

the guidelines.

15

Both are correct.

Now those opinions differed in their

16

reasoning, such that Freeman itself has no

17

precedential effect under Marks, but the two

18

approaches can be united under a common

19

umbrella, namely, long-standing principles of

20

proximate and multiple causation.

21

because each form of guidelines reliance bears

22

a close connection to the sentence.

23

The first -­

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

And that's

Mr. Shumsky, could

you address one issue for me on this question?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
4
1

In a (C) agreement, the government is giving

2

up, often, certain things.

Sometimes they

3

dismiss additional charges.

Sometimes, as

4

here, they give up filing a persistent felony

5

certificate.

6

prosecute someone important to the defendant.

7

There are many things that go into that

8

bargain.

9

Sometimes they agree not to

How is a district court judge to

10

determine whether a departure from the

11

guideline range is justified?

12

circumstances is what the government given up

13

valuable enough to keep the original deal and

14

when is it not?

15
16
17

MR. SHUMSKY:

In what

Justice Sotomayor, let

me answer the question in two parts if I can.
First of all, those conditions, the

18

way Your Honor describes C-type agreements, are

19

true also for B-type agreements and for the

20

sort of C-type agreements that the government

21

concedes open the door to eligibility for

22

relief under 3582(c)(2).

23

category of C-type agreement that the

24

government is proposing to carve out is not

25

different in that way than all of these other

So this particular

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
5
1

categories of agreements.

2

This -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Except that -­

3

let's take -- dismissing charges, I -- I think

4

it could be seen as relatively easy.

5

different were the charges and the exposure

6

from what was kept and what was the strength of

7

the government's evidence?

8

could talk about that at sentencing on those

9

charges.

10

How

And the government

But the persistent felony offender

11

certificate is a different judgment, which is:

12

I, the government, think that a sentence of X

13

amount justifies giving up that certificate.

14

How would a district court make up for the loss

15

of that belief by the government?

16

MR. SHUMSKY:

Well, so -- Justice

17

Sotomayor, let me push back a little bit still

18

--

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

MR. SHUMSKY:

Okay.

-- on the first part of

21

my answer and then -- and then get to the

22

second part.

23

in a C-type agreement in which there is a range

24

defined by the guidelines, and the government

25

agrees that those sentences are eligible for

Again, that's no different than

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
6
1

relief under 3582(c)(2).

2

there is that, rather than a number potentially

3

moving a bit, a range will move a bit.

4

again, I don't think it's categorically

5

different in that way.

6

The only difference

So,

But to answer the second part of the

7

question, the district court judge, exercising

8

her or his discretion, will apply the 3553(a)

9

factors just like they do in any other case

10

where there's a request for discretionary

11

relief under 3582(c)(2).

12

Remember that this is only a question

13

of eligibility.

14

relief.

15

go back to the very same district court judge

16

who is the one who approved the agreement in

17

the first place and determine whether under the

18

circumstances, again, the 3553(a)

19

circumstances, some adjustment is appropriate.

20

It's not a guarantee of

It just enables the case ordinarily to

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

When wouldn't any

eligibility?

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So are you

3

conceding there's no -- you can't imagine a

4

scenario where someone wouldn't be eligible?

5
6
7

MR. SHUMSKY:
sorry.

No, Your Honor.

I'm

Perhaps I misunderstood the question.
In a circumstance, for instance, under

8

which the district court says -- using the

9

discretion that it has post-Booker under cases

10

like Gall and Spears, the district court says

11

I'm not applying the guidelines at all, I

12

disagree with the guidelines as a policy

13

matter; under those circumstances, it's very

14

hard to see how in any ordinary meaning of the

15

term a sentence is based on the guidelines.

16

But absent circumstances like those,

17

ordinarily, a sentence will be based on the

18

guidelines, and that only makes sense.

19

Court has said over and over and over

20

post-Booker, in cases like Gall and Peugh and

21

most recently in Molina-Martinez, that

22

sentences are ordinarily based on the

23

guidelines.

24
25

This

And so it won't be surprising if,
indeed, a district court concludes that that's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
9
1

what occurs.

2

for in the shadow of the guidelines, as the

3

concurrence in Freeman put it; that is where

4

the parties start.

5

Not only is a sentence bargained

The United States Attorneys' Manual

6

directs prosecutors, not just to charge, but to

7

make plea-bargaining determinations consistent

8

with the guidelines.

9

exactly the same thing when they sit down with

Defense attorneys do

10

their client for the first time, they look at

11

the guidelines and say:

13

Here's what you're

And so it shouldn't be surprising

14

that, ordinarily, other than in the sort of

15

relatively extreme circumstances I was alluding

16

to a moment ago, sentences, indeed, will be

17

based on the guidelines.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The first

19

question we posed was how to apply Marks in

20

this situation, and I wonder if I'm a court of

21

appeals judge, it seems to me the most

22

important thing in deciding the case is to make

23

sure that I'm not reversed.

24

the best way to do that is through the -­

25

whatever you want to call it, the walking

And it seems to me

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

through, sort of counting out what would happen

2

if you count where the different votes are.

3

And it seems to me if you take any

4

other approach, you're -- you're subject to

5

reversal because, by definition, a majority of

6

the Court here would -- would reach a different

7

result.

8
9

MR. SHUMSKY:

I would say a couple of

things about that, Mr. Chief Justice.

10

First of all, Marks focuses on the

11

holding or the judgment of the Court.

12

under Marks, what we're trying to figure out is

13

whether there's precedent.

14

court's holding qualifies as precedent, and a

15

holding is the reasoning that's necessary to

16

support the judgment.

17

And so,

Ordinarily, only a

The government's alternate approach,

18

its run-the-facts-through-the-opinions

19

approach, first of all, I'm not sure it even

20

purports to be an application of Marks in that

21

sense.

22

Second of all, it is predicated upon

23

counting dissenting votes.

And Marks itself

24

says quite specifically that that's not what

25

Marks is about.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
11

Marks talks about the position taken

2

by those members who concurred in the

3

judgments.

4

similar terms, votes necessary to the judgment.

And O'Dell at page 160 speaks in

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But as a

practical -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, suppose we -­

no, you go ahead.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

As a practical

10

matter, though, in a particular case, that

11

would have the court of appeals writing an

12

opinion that would be subject to reversal.

13

MR. SHUMSKY:

And that -- and that,

14

Mr. Chief Justice, is the other thing I was

15

going to say.

16

put it a moment ago -- a moment ago in asking

17

the question, is that a lower court would be

18

wise to look at what the opinions say.

I think that -- that the way you

19

And, of course, it would be.

20

way that lower courts are wise to look at this

21

Court's dicta, to look at concurring

22

opinions -­

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The same

Then why should

24

they -- why should they pretend that this Court

25

had an opinion that counts as precedent?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

They

Official
12
1

can say:

2

thought this, two justices thought that, and

3

we're going to read those opinions and then

4

give our best judgment of what the right answer

5

is without being bound by a minority of the

6

justices.

7

All right, we see four justices

MR. SHUMSKY:

Justice Ginsburg, that

8

-- we think that that is exactly correct.

9

lower court is wise to pay attention to the

A

10

votes of justices, but that is a very different

11

question than whether there is binding

12

precedent.

13

And, here, what the Eleventh Circuit

14

concluded was simply that it had to follow the

15

concurring opinion in Freeman, that it was the

16

vote of one justice was the law of the land,

17

notwithstanding the fact that eight justices

18

had sharply disagreed with that reasoning.

19

And so, Justice Ginsburg, we think

20

that that's not right.

Now, to be clear, a

21

lower court could say:

I am going to count

22

votes.

23

Court might do.

24
25

I am going to predict what the Supreme

But I think that a slightly different
hypothetical points out the difficulty with

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1
2

this.
Mr. Chief Justice, if you imagine

3

instead of a case that comes right back up to a

4

nearly identically constituted court on the

5

exact same question, 15 years have passed or 20

6

years have passed.

7

under those circumstances for a court to engage

8

in that same kind of nose counting and say:

9

Well, because that one justice 20 years ago

It would be quite strange

10

thought this thing, that is the only decision

11

we can reach.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, Marks has been

13

the -- the law for 40 years, and for better or

14

worse, it has had a big effect, I think, on

15

what we have understood to be the jurisprudence

16

of this Court and what the lower courts have

17

understood to be our precedents and on the way

18

in which justices of this Court go about doing

19

their job.

20

And if we abandon anything like Marks,

21

perhaps it requires -- it certainly could

22

benefit from some clarification and maybe some

23

refinement -- but if we abandon it completely,

24

it could have pretty profound changes.

25

should we do that?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Why

Official
14
1

MR. SHUMSKY:

Justice Alito, our first

2

argument, of course, is that the Court should

3

refine Marks.

4

subset test or, as this Court put it in

5

Nichols, looking for a common denominator, is

6

the most sensible way to do that, consistent

7

with the norms about precedent and holdings

8

that I was alluding to earlier.

9

And we think that the logical

JUSTICE ALITO:

Let me -­

Well, you know,

10

Professor -- Professor Re wrote an interesting

11

amicus brief in this case arguing that the

12

logical subset approach is illogical.

13

think there might be something to that.

14

give you this example.

15

And I
Let me

Let's say that nine people are

16

deciding which movie to go and see, and four of

17

them want to see a romantic comedy, and two of

18

them want to see a romantic comedy in French,

19

and four of them want to see a mystery.

20

Now is the -- are the -- are the two

21

who want to see the romantic comedy in French,

22

is that a logical subset of those who want to

23

see a romantic comedy?

24

MR. SHUMSKY:

25

answer is it depends.

Justice Alito, the
And those people could

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

say what their view about that is.

2

just -­

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

4

nothing more than that.

5

And the

MR. SHUMSKY:

Well, suppose we know

Then it is a fair

6

presumption, at least under certain

7

circumstances, I can't speak to romantic

8

comedies in French, but there are a couple of

9

this Court's precedents under which, contrary

10

to what Professor Re has said, logical subsets

11

do, in fact, make a great sense -- a great deal

12

of sense, if not all the time, then nearly all

13

the time.

14

So if you -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean, if that's a

15

logical subset, I think there's a serious

16

problem with the argument because the four who

17

want to see a romantic comedy might think:

18

don't want to see anything in a foreign

19

language, particularly in French.

20

go see a mystery or something else.

21

MR. SHUMSKY:

I

I'd rather

So, Justice Alito, and I

22

think this is the key to the -- the puzzle,

23

anytime two people, be they justices of this

24

Court or people going to see a romantic comedy,

25

can say here's how far I go, but I don't agree

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

with that thing over there.

2

And so sometimes we see justices

3

saying:

I take an absolutist view and anything

4

less than that is legally wrong.

5

those circumstances, we would know what those

6

justices think.

7

have, like they always have, the prerogative to

8

articulate how far their view goes and whether

9

something less makes sense.

And, of course, justices would

But at least -­

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

MR. SHUMSKY:

12
13

And under

Well, that -­

-- as a way of

understanding -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm -- I'm

14

sorry, but that means that you would want them

15

to engage in -- in dicta.

16

you're saying, let's say someone has an

17

absolute view of the First Amendment.

18

can't have any restraints at all.

In other words,

You

19

And the concurring opinion says, well,

20

I agree with that, except when it comes to, you

21

know, communists, then I think they shouldn't

22

have the right to speak.

23

that the people who think there's an absolute

24

right may say, well, it's absolute, but, if

25

you're going to carve out anybody, you've got

And you don't know

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1

to carve out everybody.

2

And what you're suggesting is that to

3

make things clearer for the courts of appeals

4

down the road, those justices should talk about

5

these hypothetical cases, about how they would

6

apply the rule in the event, you know, that

7

this or that happens.

8
9

And I wonder if that's more
problematic than the difficulties you have with

10

just sort of the counting -- counting-through

11

approach.

12

MR. SHUMSKY:

I don't think it is,

13

Your Honor.

14

have the prerogative, like they always do, to

15

articulate how far their rule goes.

16

The point is simply that justices

But I do want to make sure, Justice

17

Alito, to get to at least a couple of examples

18

that demonstrate that the logical subset, while

19

it may be imperfect, like all of these rules

20

are, it at least has some significant utility,

21

contrary to what Professor Re said.

22

So if you look like -- at a case like

23

Ford, that was interpreted in Panetti, you have

24

a plurality of justices saying we require full

25

competency proceedings with all of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

hallmarks of a trial, and Justice Powell

2

writing separately saying:

3

that is enough.

cross-examination.

witnesses.

6

Something less than

We don't need
We don't need live

There, it's pretty fair to say that

7

the lesser version is included within the

8

broader version that the plurality would have

9

wanted, or in a case like Caldwell -­

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's covered by

Marks automatically.
MR. SHUMSKY:

I'm not sure what it

means to say that something is covered -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Meaning Marks says

15

what's the narrowest holding of a plurality in

a concurrence.

17

the literal interpretation of Marks, your

18

situation's covered.

19

situation where the reasoning doesn't

20

necessarily overlap completely.

21

MR. SHUMSKY:

22
23

And under that interpretation,

We're talking about a

Again, two points,

Justice Sotomayor.
I think that -- that the language of

24

narrowest in Marks is, frankly, part of the

25

problem here.

And that is the strength of -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
19
1

of what Professor Re has said.

2

guidance Marks may have provided, it's probably

3

caused more confusion than -- than guidance.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Whatever

Why -- but -- is

5

the confusion -- is the -- why is the confusion

6

necessarily so evil?

7

makes a counterpoint which says you want

8

something to -- to follow a split decision by

9

the Court.

Meaning, the government

You want some even-handed,

10

predictable, and consistent development of the

11

law, at least on some level.

12

there's some confusion, there is some

13

predictability that's going on.

And even if

14

Under the Re test, there isn't any.

15

It's as if the decision was made and nothing

16

has happened because we're still sending it

17

back for the lower courts to be without real

18

guidance.

19

MR. SHUMSKY:

I think the strength of

20

Professor Re's view, Justice Sotomayor, is that

21

the current situation is not, in fact,

22

providing much, if any, guidance.

23

16 to 17 of his amicus brief and in the

24

underlying paper, he lays out innumerable

25

circuit splits that have resulted from efforts

9

norm of actual majority rule would provide

10

clarity.

11

occur in the lower courts, which would aid this

12

Court in its ultimate decision-making.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, the question

14

is, what is the second best?

15

in which the first-best option, which is five

16

people agreeing on the reasoning, that doesn't

exist.

18

be -- is going to have some kind of problem

19

attached to it, and we're really picking among

problems.

We're in a world

And so everything else is going to

I guess what I wonder is why you say

22

the -- the solution that we should pick is just

23

a solution in which this Court is giving no

24

guidance and courts are out there on their own

25

and doing their own thing and splitting with

each other, dividing with each other, not

2

having any way to resolve these cases, which

3

sounds like chaos to me.

4

And the government -- what the

5

government says is:

Look, this isn't the best

6

approach, but it's the second-best approach, is

7

if you don't have common reasoning, just ask

8

about results.

9

and know that there are five justices on the

11

you should go with X.

12

And we can talk about how that counts

13

dissenting votes or, you know, give various

14

theoretical objections to that, but, in the

15

end, we do try to get to five here.

16

how to get to five in some of these cases, even

17

if the five depend on different reasoning.

18

isn't that just the second-best approach?

19

MR. SHUMSKY:

We know

Why

So, just to clarify if I

20

may, Justice Kagan, and then to turn to that,

our position is not that there should be chaos,

Well, you carve out a

to be, you vote for chaos.

asking, why vote for chaos in all of these

cases or even in some of these cases?

7

MR. SHUMSKY:

And I guess I'm

So, to be clear, Justice

8

Kagan, and I -- I don't want to quibble, but, I

9

mean, the idea is not that it's chaos; it's

10

that the lower courts can then percolate the

issue, as this Court often invites them to do.

MR. SHUMSKY:

turn to the question about the -- the running

18

mean, it is not just a secondary concern that

19

that relies on dissents.

20

contrary to everything that this Court has said

21

for not just decades but hundreds of years

22

about how to identify precedents and holdings.

If dicta is not precedent, it doesn't count as

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Shumsky, I

think -- I think your approach relies on

dissents sometimes too, because take one of

5

these logical subset cases.

where the concurrence splits off with the

11
12

You have a

So you're counting dissents too, I
think.

13

MR. SHUMSKY:

To be very clear about

14

this, Your Honor, that is not our position,

15

that the concurring opinion would only be given

16

force insofar as to -- or, the extent that it

17

is an opinion that is necessary to the

18

judgment.

19

But I -- I do want to -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's necessary to the

20

judgment, but the result of applying -- but,

21

you know, the plurality would grant relief in

22

this much -- this many cases.

23

would grant relief in many fewer cases and deny

24

relief in lots of cases where the dissent would

25

also deny relief.

The concurrence

So, by privileging the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
24
1

concurrence, you're essentially saying that

2

when the concurrence agrees with the dissent,

3

the concurrence wins, which I take it is a way

4

-- is -- is -- is because the concurrence plus

5

the dissent equals five.

6

MR. SHUMSKY:

I -- I don't think so,

7

Justice Kagan.

8

this gets back to a question that you were

9

asking earlier.

10

And, Justice Sotomayor, I think

If the Venn diagrams overlap, if the

11

Russian dolls don't fit, then, under those

12

circumstances, it's not a logical subset.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm talking about a

14

case in which it is completely nested, but the

15

-- but -- it is completely nested, but the

16

concurrence is sometimes granting the relief

17

that the plurality would but sometimes,

18

instead, reaching the result the dissent would.

19

And by saying the concurrence controls

20

in those cases, you're giving effect to the

21

times when the concurrence plus the dissent

22

equals five.

23

MR. SHUMSKY:

I think that for the

24

same reasons I was indicating about reliance on

25

-- about the importance of holdings, we would

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
25
1

not say that it controls under those

2

circumstances.

3

Now perhaps the next case might come

4

up and there would be an opportunity to

5

evaluate that, but, Justice Kagan, I want to

6

make sure to answer -­

7
8
9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, in those

circumstances, there is no result?
MR. SHUMSKY:

Well, there would be a

10

bare result, certainly, but the concurrence

11

would not be controlling as to cases in which

12

it has to be paired with the dissent.

13

I want to make sure to answer directly

14

your question, Justice Kagan, about what's

15

wrong with the government's approach, and then

16

I might try and -- and turn back to the -- the

17

3582 question for a moment if I can.

18

What is wrong with the government's

19

approach is not just that it is contrary to

20

these pretty fundamental notions about

21

precedent and holdings but because it would

22

stunt the development of the law.

23

It would say at precisely the moment

24

at which this Court is unable to reach a

25

majority, the lower courts should stop trying

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

to sort these issues out.

2

hoping that we can get to an actual result,

3

whether because of the coming together of the

4

lower courts or because a justice changes their

mind or a justice joins a -­

6

We should stop

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

Why is

7

the development of the law stunted completely?

8

You tell us that there's confusion in a split,

9

which suggests to me that the split is

10

occasioned, likely in part, by the circuit's

11

view of the persuasiveness of the split of some

12

other side's argument on the split.

13

So it's not, I don't think,

14

necessarily that it stifles discussion in any

15

meaningful way.

16

-- you say this kind of confusion, I don't

like.

18

You're just -- you just don't

MR. SHUMSKY:

I think the point is a

bit different, Justice Sotomayor, in the

20

following way:

21

this Court splinters and when there is no

middle ground, as the government puts it, at

23

that point, all that is left for a lower court

24

to do is run the facts through the opinions.

JUSTICE ALITO:

you this quick question?

a majority of the Court that -- that agrees

that a particular party is entitled to relief,

9

but there is no majority as to the provision of

the Constitution that provides the relief.

11

What happens in that situation?

12

MR. SHUMSKY:

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

So that's never a

precedent unless one of the two -- and both of

these groups feel very strongly that the other

is wrong in identifying the constitutional

provision.

So one of them has to give way or

MR. SHUMSKY:

I think that -- let me

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RACHEL P. KOVNER

23

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

24
25

MS. KOVNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
29
1

The circuit split here concerns the

2

interpretation of the Marks rule.

3

Court should decide this case by rejecting the

4

view of the two circuits that treat divided

5

decisions of this Court as entitled to no

6

precedential effect unless the separate

7

opinions of this Court share the same

8

reasoning.

9

And this

That approach is flatly contrary to

10

what this Court said in Marks.

11

to how this Court has applied Marks.

12

undercuts the principle of vertical stare

13

decisis that generally requires lower courts to

14

decide cases in the way that this Court would

15

decide them.

16

It's contrary
And it

Now I take Petitioner to raise two

17

main objections to that.

The first is an

18

argument that Marks, as this Court has

19

developed it, requires considering dissents.

20

I do want to make clear that's only

21

true in a limited sense.

When this Court

22

applies the Marks doctrine, it's picking one of

23

the opinions that led to the judgment in the

24

case at hand and treating that judgment -­

25

treating that opinion as controlling.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
30
1

So it's -- the Marks -­

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Even though it's

3

the opinion of only one.

4

think, an illustration that's familiar.

5

So let's take, I

For years, it was thought that Justice

6

Powell's opinion in Bakke was controlling.

7

That was a 4-4-1.

8

But none of the others took the position that

9

he did.

And he was in the middle.

So a single justice was thought to

10

determine what this Court's precedent for the

11

nots was.

12

MS. KOVNER:

That's right, Your Honor.

13

I think that this Court has consistently

14

applied Marks in that way by picking an opinion

15

that's not subscribed to by the members -- by

16

all the members of the Court or by a majority

17

and describing that as the controlling opinion.

18

And I think the reason, Justice

19

Ginsburg, is that when the Court applies that

20

opinion, it's not applying an opinion that

21

leads to the result that's favored by only one

22

member of the Court.

23

that leads to the result that's favored by a

24

majority of the Court.

25

application, the application of that opinion

It's applying an opinion

And in every

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
31
1

also is supported by the reasoning of a

2

majority of members of this Court.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That might be true,

4

but it might not be.

I mean, there are middle

5

ground positions that, if --in a 4-1-4 case,

6

where the four would say, well, if we can't get

7

what we want, we'd rather have the middle

8

ground position.

9

where there are middle ground positions which

But there are some cases

10

seem utterly incoherent to anybody else,

11

incoherent or maybe it's based on what you

12

think is an impermissible criterion, or for

13

some reason the middle ground is the worst of

14

all possible worlds.

15
16
17

So how do you deal with those sorts of
cases?
MS. KOVNER:

So we think ordinarily

18

that the opinions in the case itself will deal

19

with that in the following sense:

20

Freeman as an example, there's, I think, a sort

21

of broad opinion, a in-between opinion, and a

22

narrow opinion.

23

So, to take

And it's true that some opinions in

24

Freeman criticize the middle ground, but,

25

nevertheless, the plurality in Freeman voted

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
32
1

with the concurrence to create a common result.

2

I think if the plurality thought that

3

it were intolerable to have that middle ground

4

position control the day, the plurality could

5

say, given that we can't have our rule, our

6

second choice is the categorical rule on the

7

other side, and could join that opinion.

8
9

But we think the plurality indicated
through its vote that that's not what it wanted

10

to have happen.

11

concurrence and have that control the day.

12

It wanted to join with the

JUSTICE BREYER:

So how -- look, I -­

13

I don't know what I'd write in this case.

14

the reason I would write, if we have to get to

15

this issue, the reason I don't know is because

16

I think law is part art and part science.

17

you learn in law school and thereafter how to

18

read an opinion.

19

And

And

There are no absolute rules.

Marbury versus Madison, two-thirds of

20

it is not necessary to the conclusion.

21

should we pay no attention to it?

22

we pay attention to it.

So

Of course,

23

And then I can cite five, but I won't,

24

where it may be that on this matter there was a

25

unanimous Court, but nobody believes it because

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
33
1

it wasn't, you see.

2

And they all go off.

And Powell, of course, is, in part,

3

key because he had a sensible view.

4

public, the lawyers, the -- the clients, the

5

other judges, are the ones who tell us that

6

over time.

7

And the

So, if you ask me to write something

8

better than Marks, I don't know what to say,

except what I just said, which will help

nobody.

MS. KOVNER:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

So -­
And say -- interpret

it with common sense.

14

MS. KOVNER:

So I agree with that, but

15

I think there is one clarification that there's

16

a circuit split on and it would be helpful for

17

this Court to resolve.

18

There are two circuits that say,

19

contrary to the views of other circuits, that

20

you need to have not only shared results, which

21

I think is -­

22
23

JUSTICE BREYER:

You say they're

wrong.

24

MS. KOVNER:

That's right, Your Honor.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

And then they say

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

what's right, we don't tell them.

2

MS. KOVNER:

No, I think if the Court

3

can say, Marks, and I think the one thing that

4

the Court can add to Marks if it wants to

5

provide further guidance, is that what the

6

Marks rule is doing is it's achieving vertical

7

stare decisis.

8

lower courts decide cases in the manner that

9

this Court would.

10

It's a way of ensuring that

And so, to the extent that in a

11

particular case there's difficulty in

12

identifying one opinion as the narrowest, a

13

thing that the courts can also do is run the

14

facts of the case through multiple opinions and

15

see whether the result that is achieved there

16

is the result that's favored by a majority of

17

the court.

18

Court has done in -- in -- in applying Marks

19

too.

20

Of course, that's something this

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

May I ask two

21

questions?

22

third question of the petition.

23

I don't want you to ignore the

But the first one is, if we are able

24

to reach a majority in the Freeman question,

25

should we reach the Marks inquiry, and, if so,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
36
1

how and why?

2

pure dicta.

3

I mean, we usually -- it would be

MS. KOVNER:

I think that's right,

4

Your Honor.

5

choice about how it wants to resolve this case.

6

And we would urge the Court to resolve the case

7

on the Marks ground because that is where there

8

is a circuit split.

9

And so the Court, I think, has a

There's no division on Freeman aside

10

from just a question -- the underlying Marks

11

question of do you need common reasoning or

12

only common results.

13

issue that's divided the lower courts.

14

So that's really the

As a second sort of reason that

15

relates to that, Your Honor, is Freeman itself

16

is a statutory interpretation question that

17

this Court -- you know, we obviously took a

18

broader position than Your Honor's opinion in

19

Freeman, but this Court resolved that issue.

20

It's essentially an issue for how the parties

21

are going to bargain.

22

So the parties have arranged their

23

expectations in subsequent cases, including

24

this one, around the understanding that Freeman

25

provided a rule for how their plea agreements

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
37
1
2

are going to be interpreted.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

As -- and what the

3

prosecutors are now doing is making a waiver of

4

any amendment of the guidelines in almost all

5

(C) agreements.

6

MS. KOVNER:

I -- I don't -- I

7

actually don't think that's the case

8

empirically, Your Honor.

9

most part, prosecutors have been understanding

10

that Freeman is the rule, and we haven't seen,

11

to my knowledge, the vast majority of districts

12

actually incorporate those kinds of waivers.

13

I think that, for the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now I have a

14

question on the substance of the -- of the

15

plurality's position.

16

the argument that -- and examples provided in

17

the briefing -- where the government goes to

18

sentencing and says we did this in light of the

19

guidelines.

20

There is some force to

And under the concurrence in Freeman,

21

that would not count.

Is -- is that right?

22

And why is that right?

23

is telling the judge, I'm doing this because of

24

the guidelines, what difference does it make

25

that it's in the plea agreement or not?

If -- if the prosecutor

Heritage Reporting Corporation

It's

Official
38
1
2

still a representation by the government.
MS. KOVNER:

That's right, Your Honor.

3

I think that once Freeman was established, we

4

can expect the parties to negotiate around the

5

rule in Freeman.

6

the parties have an understanding that this is

7

a sentence based on the guidelines within the

8

meaning of Your Honor's opinion in Freeman,

9

that's something they know that they should be

10

And so, to the extent that

putting in the plea agreement.

11

And we think that it's desirable to

12

have that one place to look for the -- where

13

the parties' understanding is rather than sort

14

of combing through the background negotiations

15

of the parties.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Except the

17

plurality says there's a player that you're not

18

considering, which is the judge, and the judge

19

accepts the agreement because a prosecutor has

20

gotten up and said we think it should be within

21

the guidelines.

22

agreement, but the prosecutor is guiding the

23

judge and incentivizing the judge to accept

24

this agreement with that representation.

25

It's not in the plea

So why shouldn't that be recognized?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
39
1

MS. KOVNER:

So I think, you know,

2

both Your Honor's opinion in Freeman and the

3

dissenting opinion in Freeman sort of note that

4

there's a real difference between background

5

considerations that go into what the deal is

6

and then what the sort of deal ultimately is.

7

Ultimately, in a (C) agreement, you

8

know, the parties bargain for a specific

9

determinate sentence and they urge the court to

10

impose that -- that sentence.

11

you know, Your Honor's opinion indicated and -­

12

and -- and four other justices agreed, that is

13

what the sentence is based on.

14

And that is, as,

And if there's doubt about that, I

15

think there are a few things that the Court can

16

look to to resolve that doubt.

17

the Sentencing Commission's guidance.

18

The first is

The Sentencing Commission's guidance

19

indicates that the only guidelines that should

20

be changed through 3582 are the guidelines that

21

were actually applied when the defendant was

22

sentenced.

23

in a C case.

24
25

And that's surely not what happens

And the other I think is sort of
reasons of administrability that Your Honor's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
40
1

opinion alludes to in Freeman.

2

The alternative is, on Petitioner's

3

approach, you're going to be combing through

4

the record to see whether in a particular case

5

the by -- the guidelines bore a sufficiently

6

close connection to the sentence.

7

an administrable inquiry.

That's not

And then, on the back end, as Your
Honor's opinion alludes to in Freeman, you're

10

going to have a judge trying to determine after

11

the fact what is the alternative agreement that

12

this part -- the parties would have entered

13

into if -- if the guidelines had been

14

different?

15

And that's not the kind of -­

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that's -­

17

that's the way I phrased the question earlier,

18

but really the question is not what will the

19

parties do?

20

do?

The question really is what will I

21

MS. KOVNER:

I -­

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I mean, because

23

every (C) agreement before it takes effect has

24

to be approved by the judge.

25

So really it's the judge who has to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
41
1

determine would I have accepted this or not -­

2

MS. KOVNER:

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

the guideline was in error?

5

MS. KOVNER:

I -­
-- knowing that

I actually think that's

6

the way in which a C plea is fundamentally

7

different from other kinds of pleas, as -- as

8

Your Honor's opinion in Freeman alludes to,

9

which is part of a -- part of a C plea is that

10

the parties agreed to it.

11

said I'm not going to accept this plea, you'd

12

be back to the drawing board for the parties.

13

And so that's why Petitioner's approach means

14

the judge has to figure out, okay, if the judge

15

said no, what would the parties have done under

16

that circumstance?

17

And so, if a judge

And as Your Honor alluded to in -- in

18

-- in your questions, often, the government has

19

given up, for instance, a mandatory minimum,

20

you know, additional charges, you know.

21

this case, I think there's no reason to think

22

that the government would have agreed to a more

23

favorable deal if the guidelines had been

24

different.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

In

In a (C) agreement,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
42
1

it says, the Commission, that the judge -- it's

2

the judge who will depart if that's the

3

agreement, and it says the agreed -- he has to

4

write his reasons in writing as to why the

5

agreed sentence "departs from the applicable

6

guideline range" for justifiable reasons.

7

So, if the guideline range is 120

8

months, he says why it departs from that, and

9

he has some reasons.

10

And if it's 100 months,

he says why it departs from that.

11

Now, much of the time, perhaps, I

12

don't know for sure, but, of course, you are

13

referring to the guideline.

14

guideline is one thing, you might do A, and if

15

it's another thing, you might do B.

16

certainly, you will have to say something

17

different where the guideline is 100 versus

18

120.

19

And if the

And,

Not certainly, but almost certainly.
So why isn't that good enough?

That's

20

good enough to say that where the guideline's

21

two levels lower, you know, you can get that

22

advantage because your original sentence was in

23

some sense based upon the guideline, namely,

24

the sense that I just mentioned.

25

MS. KOVNER:

So I think this case is a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
43
1

-- is a really good example, Justice Breyer, of

2

why that doesn't work.

3

know in particular cases what the parties would

4

have done absent the guidelines.

You're not going to

5

So that, you know -­

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, I don't know.

7

All I have to know is what the judge would have

8

done.

9

put his -- you know, I'd just be -­

He's the one who departed and he had to

10

MS. KOVNER:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

Right.
-- repeating what I

said.

13

So we know in every sentence like that

14

there will be words about the applicable

15

guideline.

16

MS. KOVNER:

Yes.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

And much of the time,

18

it will have something to do with the

19

applicable guideline.

20

enough?

21

MS. KOVNER:

And why isn't that good

So, Justice Breyer, to

22

take, for instance, this case, there is no

23

reason to believe, I think, in this case that

24

the judge would have rejected the parties' plea

25

agreement if the judge had calculated the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
44
1

guidelines differently.

2

case, the particular change to the Sentencing

3

Guidelines that the -- you know, that was

4

ultimately made had already been proposed.

5

parties knew about it, the judge knew about it,

6

and nobody indicated that that fact -- if the

7

-- if that guidelines change had been in

8

effect, the result would have been different.

9

For instance, in this

The

And, here, I think there's good reason

10

why the judge would have accepted this plea -­

11

plea agreement, which was for a

12

below-guidelines sentence, even if the

13

guidelines had been different, because the

14

government was giving up a mandatory minimum in

15

which the government could have insisted on a

16

life sentence in this case.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Suppose we say you're

18

absolutely right, and that's why the word

19

"based upon" cannot just refer to these

20

hypotheticals we know nothing about.

21

Therefore, "based upon" refers to an instance

22

where the judge made significant use of the

23

guideline, either in his reasoning or in the

24

reasons that he gave, which, of course, would

25

throw this case right into the opposite side

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

that you want.

2

workable rule, and we'd say "based upon" at

3

least means that.

4

But, nonetheless, it would be a

MS. KOVNER:

So I think there are a

5

few reasons.

6

respectfully, that in the ordinary case, it's

7

going to be easy to sort out whether the -- the

8

-- whether the court was just calculating the

9

guidelines, which Petitioner suggests would not

10

be enough, or was relying -­

11
12

First of all, we don't think,

JUSTICE BREYER:

In a (C) agreement,

it would be because he has to write it down.

13

MS. KOVNER:

I -- I think all he has

14

to indicate is that there were justifiable

15

reasons for him to accept the sentence,

16

notwithstanding that -- notwithstanding that

17

the sentence in a particular case was outside

18

the guidelines.

19

And I think there's some additional

20

reasons why that approach wouldn't be a good

21

one.

22

guidance.

23

indicated it has to be -- in order for 3582

24

relief to be available, the guideline has to

25

have actually been applied at sentencing.

The first is the Sentencing Commission's
The Sentencing Commission has

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

And then I think there's a stare

2

decisis reason, which is the Court, you know,

3

whatever -- whatever the merits of the rule in

4

Freeman, and, obviously, the government took a

5

slightly broader approach to the extent to

6

which 3582 denies relief, but this is an

7

opinion of this Court that this plea and other

8

pleas have been sort of organized around since

9

the case was decided, and that's a case in

10

which stare -- statutory stare decisis

11

principles have their greatest force.

12

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So -­

No, I understand

14

you'd like us to decide what we're calling the

15

Marks question, rather than just resolving what

16

Freeman means.

17

But to what extent is the Marks

18

problem real outside of the Freeman context?

19

know Freeman has beset the lower courts with a

20

lot of difficulty and generated disagreements.

21

But have -- have there been real problems

22

outside of that context?

23

MS. KOVNER:

So, I mean, the -- the

24

courts that have gone against us on the Marks

25

question have indicated it's sort of their -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I

Official
47
1

it's just their interpretation of Marks, so

2

it's the interpretation they would apply in

3

future -­

4

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But they've done it

5

in the context of trying to figure out what

6

Freeman means.

7

confusion, how far have we gone to resolving

8

the problem?

9

And if we relieve them of that

MS. KOVNER:

I don't think very far,

10

Your Honor, because in any future divided

11

decision of this Court, those courts would go

12

back to applying the requirement -­

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

14

There are a lot of

divided decisions of this Court, though.

15

MS. KOVNER:

That's right.

16

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And -- and it

17

doesn't seem to be a pervasive problem outside

18

of the Freeman context, at least that you've

19

documented so far.

20

whether you had any other evidence of problems

21

outside of the Freeman context.

22

And I was just wondering

MS. KOVNER:

So I think an -- an

23

additional circumstance, you know, some of the

24

amicus briefs allude to is interpreting this

25

Court's decision in Rapanos.

You know, we

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
48
1

think this -- this same issue comes up there,

2

and, you know, the two circuits that have

3

indicated shared reasoning is necessary, I

4

think, would regard this Court's decision in

5

Rapanos as not having precedential effect.

6

And, of course, as Your Honor alludes to, there

7

are going to be, you know, future divided

8

decisions of this Court.

9

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But are there actual

10

opinions, I guess, is -- I'm sorry for pursuing

11

this -­

12

MS. KOVNER:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

-- but I'll stop.

14

But -- but are there -- are there any other

15

actual decisions like we have in the Marks?

16

MS. KOVNER:

17

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

18

So I -­
In -- in the Freeman

context?

19

MS. KOVNER:

This is often, I think,

20

briefed in -- I know there are a lot of cases

21

discussing this Marks issue in the context of

22

Rapanos.

23

think, where this has been framed most are the

24

Freeman cases.

25

essentially a recent split.

The opinions that I focused on, I

In part, that's because this is
So Davis is 2016,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

and that's where the Ninth Circuit sets out its

2

opinion.

3

arise earlier in one case, that was King, and I

4

think that -- which I know obviously involved

5

an opinion -- interpretation of a different

6

opinion of this Court.

7

I think the D.C. Circuit case, it did

I think Your -- Your Honor is right

8

that this split is framed most squarely in

9

terms of Freeman.

One of the circuits only

10

arrived to its interpretation of Marks in the

11

context of Freeman.

12
13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Don't you think

that -­

14

MS. KOVNER:

But those courts have set

15

out rules that are going to apply in future

16

cases.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Didn't the

18

commentary that's been referred to, Re and the

19

other one, give lots of examples?

20

MS. KOVNER:

I think they -- the -­

21

the -- Professor Re's brief I take to indicate

22

--

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

24

-- the long article.

25

MS. KOVNER:

Yes.

Not the brief.

The

I take him to have

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
50
1

identified cases where he asserts that this -­

2

there's been difficulty applying Marks in the

3

past, so perhaps that supports the idea that

4

there is benefit to be had from clarifying what

5

the Marks rule means.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It has been said

7

that -- in one of the briefs, that the

8

government in several cases endorsed this

9

so-called Russian doll approach.

Is that true

10

that the government once did, and is the

11

government giving it up now?

12

MS. KOVNER:

No, I mean, in -- I know

13

in the cases interpreting Rapanos, the

14

government has consistently taken the position

15

we've interpreted here.

16

cite one of the petitions in -- a petition we

17

filed in a case called McWane, but I -- my

18

reading of that petition is that it's entirely

19

consistent with our opinion here.

20

suggest -- I'm not aware of any filing in which

21

we've suggested the Marks rule requires shared

22

reasoning in order for a decision to have

23

precedential effect.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Petitioners, I think,

We don't

If we followed the -­

your predictive approach, why should we -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
51
1

could it not be confined to the opinions that

2

concurred in the judgment?

3

the dissents?

4

-- the -- the ones that concurred in the

5

judgment?

6

Why should we count

Why -- why not just look at the

MS. KOVNER:

So I -- I take the Marks

7

rule -- I think that would be contrary to what

8

this Court has said and done for about 40 years

9

where it said you identify the narrowest

10

opinion concurring in the judgment and then you

11

treat that as the controlling rule, even though

12

in some cases that opinion aligns with the

13

dissent and in some cases with the plurality.

14

And we think that's the right rule,

15

Justice Alito, because, otherwise, in every

16

Marks case, the Court would essentially need to

17

take the case twice, once for the cases where

18

the plurality assigns -- aligns with the

19

concurrence and once for the cases where the

20

concurrence assigns with the -- aligns with the

21

dissent.

22

And in that case, the members of this

23

Court could issue identical opinions to the

24

ones they issued in the first case because all

25

of the opinions have already fleshed out

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
52
1

exactly what rule the justices are applying,

2

but it would need to essentially -- this Court

3

would need to essentially take the case twice.

4

The rule that was set out in the first case

5

would depend somewhat arbitrarily on the

6

vehicle in which the Court initially granted

7

cert.

8

We don't think there's any need for

9

the Court to expend its resources in this way,

10

and the effect would be an undesirable one for

11

purposes of vertical stare decisis, where for a

12

period of time you would have courts not -- not

13

being bound by what five members of the Court

14

have indicated is the appropriate rule.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

As best you

16

interpret the Re brief and the Re article, is

17

it your position or would it be your position

18

that overruling Marks would be disruptive?

19

MS. KOVNER:

I -- I think so, Your

20

Honor.

I mean, the -- the Re article points

21

out that courts have -- courts of appeals have

22

relied on Marks quite a lot.

23

400 decisions of courts of appeals applying

24

Marks to over 100 decisions of this Court over

25

a 40-year period.

There are over

So we think there are -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
53
1

there's quite a lot of appellate court

2

jurisprudence that's based on applying Marks to

3

this Court's decisions.

4

be quite disruptive to overrule Marks.

5

So we think it would

But for the -- you know, we -- we

6

believe Marks is the correct rule for the

7

additional reason that the principle of

8

vertical stare decisis that it embodies is, I

9

think, the -- the appropriate way for lower

10

courts to adhere to this Court's decision.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

When you say that

12

Marks is fine for the cases that it works with

13

which are a logical subset, fine, but it

14

doesn't deal with every case.

15

recognize it doesn't.

16

And we just

And as far as the other cases are

17

concerned, we don't necessarily have to go into

18

them.

19

try to pick out something that is not an

20

oxymoron, but it's something along the lines of

21

legal common sense.

22

don't know that I can do better than that.

23

If we did have to go into them, you'd

MS. KOVNER:

And I -- I don't -- I -- I

So, I mean, we agree that

24

the Court doesn't need to consider or decide

25

cases that are not before it, but we would urge

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
54
1

the Court to clarify that there's no

2

requirement of -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

MS. KOVNER:

Yeah, I see.

-- of common reasoning.

5

And, you know, to go on and say in this case

6

the court -- lower court was correct to apply

7

Marks to the straightforward application of

8

Marks.

9

If there are no further questions, we

10

would urge that the judgment be affirmed.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SHUMSKY

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

16

MR. SHUMSKY:

17

Justice Sotomayor, I'd like to start

18

with your hypothetical in the circumstance in

19

which the prosecutor says the sentence here,

20

the agreement here, was based on the

21

guidelines.

22

Thank you, Your Honor.

The lower courts following Freeman

23

have interpreted the concurring opinion in

24

Freeman as prohibiting reliance on that.

25

you can look at a case like United States

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official
55

versus Dixon -­

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I'm not in

3

disagreement with that.

4

you're -- the Solicitor General's Office said,

5

when a judge rejects a (C) agreement, the

6

parties are put back to their starting point,

7

which means the government keeps its right to

8

file the persistent felony certificate or to

9

prosecute the dismissed charges or the charges

10

it proposed to dismiss.

11
12

But the one thing

In doing it this way, they don't get
that chance anymore.

13

MR. SHUMSKY:

Let me -­

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Doing it the way

the plurality suggests, they're losing that

16

chance.

17

MR. SHUMSKY:

Justice Sotomayor, let

18

me try and address this as sharply as I can.

19

This is where we started the colloquy at the

20

beginning of this argument, and I think it's

21

critical.

22

The government is not losing the

23

benefit of any bargain here, and it is

24

certainly not in any greater way than it is for

25

any other form of plea agreement.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. SHUMSKY:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

When -- when -­

MR. SHUMSKY:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No.

Because -­
This is like all

(B) agreements.

8
9

-- turning it into

a B, instead of a C, is what you're saying.

5

7

Well, you're -­

MR. SHUMSKY:

-- because, remember, we

have other types of (C) agreements with a range

10

and the government says those ones are fine.

11

We don't mind giving away the benefit of our

12

bargain for (C) agreements with a range,

13

because there, again, when Congress in these

14

narrow circumstances has said the Commission,

15

again, in narrow circumstances, is applying a

16

guide -- is applying a change retroactively,

17

under those circumstances, the bargain has

18

changed.

19

that's just the same for these agreements.

20

What was here is now here.

And

I would emphasize that the record here

21

shows that the judge, the parties, and the

22

probation officer were discussing the

23

sentencing guidelines at length.

24
25

This is not just a circumstance in
which they're being alluded to.

At 32a to 36a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

of the record, they're performing a guidelines

2

calculation.

3

reduction for acceptance of responsibility?

4

What about two points for using a gun?

5

What about the three point

And it makes sense under those

6

circumstances to send it back to the same

7

district court who accepted the bargain and who

8

had to, relying on Section 6B1.2, assess the

9

bargain.

10

That is the critical thing about

6B1.2.

11

Congress, when it enacted

12

994(a)(2)(E), directed the Commission to put

13

the judges in the middle of this process.

14

judges are assessing the agreement to determine

15

whether it is compliant with the guidelines or

16

at least compliant enough to be accepted.

The

18

there and dickered with the parties over the

guidelines.

eligible to seek relief.

22

to get it, but we're not closing the door.

agreements.
