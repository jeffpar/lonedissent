We'll hear

Skagit Indian Tribe versus Lundgren.

Mr. Hawkins.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID S. HAWKINS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. HAWKINS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

The Respondents sued the tribe to

12

challenge the tribe's title of record to the

13

property at issue.

14

held that sovereign immunity bars suits against

15

tribal governments.

16

for relief establishes that their suit is an

17

attack on the tribe's interests in the

18

property, confirming that sovereign immunity

19

bars their claim.

20
21
22
23
24
25

This Court has consistently

Respondents' own prayer

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is it -- is it not

-CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What did the

-- go ahead.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is it not the case

that no other political entity would be immune

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
4
1

from such a -- from such a quiet title suit,

2

not the United States, not a state of the

3

United States, not a foreign government?

4

you are claiming a kind of super-sovereign

5

immunity for the tribe that no -- no one else

6

gets.

7

MR. HAWKINS:

So

Justice Ginsburg, that,

8

in fact, is not the case.

9

would not be subject to a claim along the same

10

factual lines as this.

11

--

12
13

The United States

The quiet title action

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Because of the

adverse possession?

14

MR. HAWKINS:

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

are the Lundgrens supposed to do in this

17

situation if they can't bring legal action

18

affecting the tribe?

19

MR. HAWKINS:

Correct.
What -- what

Your Honor, the

20

Lundgrens are in a situation where -- similar

21

to other states that have been confronted with

22

sovereign immunity, for example, in the

23

Pottawatomi case where they were unable to

24

enforce their taxing authority and the tribe -­

25

the Court recognized that sometimes sovereign

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
5
1

immunity will lead to results that preclude

2

individuals from being able to sue for relief.

3

That being said, in this instance, it

4

would be helpful for all of the parties to

5

understand their legal standings before they

6

engage in negotiations.

7

It's our anticipation that once this

8

case is removed -- or resolved -- I beg your

9

pardon -- that we would hopefully be able to

10

engage in a negotiation with the Lundgrens.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You -- well,

12

you would be in a better position when that

13

negotiation started, wouldn't you, if we have a

14

ruling saying that you can't be sued?

15

MR. HAWKINS:

Either way, both parties

16

would be more informed as to what their legal

17

positions were during the negotiations, Your

18

Honor.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

What happens

20

generally if a tribe buys land or -- or thinks

21

it owns land in downtown Tulsa or New York City

22

or any other place off the reservation and they

23

-- they send members of the tribe there and

24

somehow they're in possession of at least part

25

of it.

How is that dispute resolved?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

2

MR. HAWKINS:
the question, Justice.

3
4

I -- I don't understand

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, what worries me

is if there is sovereign immunity -­

5

MR. HAWKINS:

Uh-huh.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- and if members of

7

the tribe acting for the tribe obtain property,

8

they -- they -- they have a building or an

9

empty lot or somewhere, and they're -- they're

10

there and there's another person who believes

11

he owns the property or the lot, the building,

12

and so there are two different people, the

13

tribe and another group, both of which thinks

14

they own a lot in New York City or Tulsa.

15

How is that dispute resolved?

16

Normally, we resolve it in a court.

But how,

17

in your opinion, will the dispute -- how has it

18

been resolved?

19

joined a case saying there was broad sovereign

20

immunity.

What I'm thinking of is I

21

MR. HAWKINS:

Yes.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

I thought Congress

23

would act, but it hasn't.

And tribes have

24

business interests all over the country, all

25

over the place.

And how are they resolved?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

MR. HAWKINS:

So I understand the

2

Kiowa decision, Your Honor, and, obviously,

3

that -- Congress did not act after that

4

decision, and -­

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

So that's why I

6

asked my question.

7

fairly common, and they -- you could get into

8

really bad situations where the only resolution

9

is force.

10

Property disputes are

That's why we have courts.
And I want to know how are they

11

resolved, how should they be resolved, if you

12

can't sue the tribe?

13

MR. HAWKINS:

So the precedent that

14

this Court has recognized in both U.S. v.

15

Alabama and the Minnesota case is that

16

sometimes that will be the reality of sovereign

17

immunity.

18

That being said, by way of example,

19

the fact that states can enforce taxes against

20

tribes have not precluded -­

21
22
23

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm not talking about

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What -- just -- for

taxes.

24

Justice Breyer's question, suppose the tribe

25

owns property outside the reservation in Tulsa

Heritage Reporting Corporation

or New York.

2

land.

Is there sovereign immunity or not?

3
4

The state wants to condemn the

MR. HAWKINS:

Sovereign immunity

applies in that situation -­

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MR. HAWKINS:

All right.

-- because the action is

7

against the -- the tribal government's

8

interests, and your holdings in Bay Mills

9

specifically provides that an action against

10

the tribe is barred.

11
12

It's Congress's -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

All right.

With respect to -­

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

But, there's

14

sovereign immunity -- look, Joe Smith owns an

15

empty lot next door to his house.

16

because of some tribal legacy or something, he

17

wakes up and finds members of the tribe there

18

next to him on the lot.

19

He says:

20

21

quite wealthy.

I own the lot next to my

22

(Laughter.)

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

One morning,

He's

The tribe members

No, this is ours.
Now how is that dispute -- since that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

9
1

decision that I joined, how is that dispute,

2

kind of dispute which could arise all over the

3

place, how has it been resolved?

4

believe there is no such thing in some form.

5

MR. HAWKINS:

I can't

So -- so, again, that is

6

a dispute that would be resolved out of the

7

judicial process.

8

Philippines case establishes that if there is a

9

dispute, the court simply looks to the merits

Your case in the -- the

10

of the claim as it pertains to the interests

11

that the pride -- the tribe has.

12

is against the tribe's interests, and it is in

13

this instance, it's a registered title here,

14

you're not confronted with a non-frivolous

15

claim on the part of the tribe.

16

If the action

In the instances that you're

17

describing, it sounds as though the tribe's

18

claims probably are going to be somewhat

19

frivolous.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

if they're frivolous.

22

Suppose they are.

But suppose they are.

23

MR. HAWKINS:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Oh, no, I don't know

So -- so if -­
Why doesn't the tribe

-- how do you get around sovereign immunity if

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1
2

they are frivolous?
MR. HAWKINS:

The -- the threshold

3

issue is whether or not the action is directed

4

against the tribe.

5

a prima facie basis that it has an interest.

6

The tribe has to establish

Once that interest is established, as

7

in this instance, where we have registered

8

title, the -- the -- the court there would

9

immediately lose its jurisdiction and the case

10
11

should be dismissed.
JUSTICE ALITO:

What would happen in

12

-- in this situation?

13

federal government wants to construct a highway

14

or maybe it's a pipeline, and there's

15

opposition to this project, so the people who

16

are opposed to the project enlist an Indian

17

tribe to buy a little parcel of land along the

18

route of this highway or this pipeline.

19
20

Let's say a state or the

That would be the end of the project,
would it not?

21

MR. HAWKINS:

That potentially would

22

be the end of the project, yes.

23

would be remedies available that the U.S.

24

Government could invoke, and it's important to

25

keep in mind that what Bay Mills stands for,

However, there

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
11

the prop -- specifically affords Congress the

2

ability to step in and act in this situation.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the -­

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You mentioned

5

Bay Mills a couple of times.

What about

6

Footnote 8 in Bay Mills?

7

have never specifically addressed "whether

8

immunity should apply in the ordinary way if a

9

tort victim, or other plaintiff who has not

There, it says we

10

chosen to deal with a tribe, has no alternative

11

way to obtain relief."

12
13

Doesn't that distinguish your reliance
on Bay Mills?

14

MR. HAWKINS:

I -- in Lewis v. Clarke,

15

you address Footnote 8 in terms of if an action

16

is directed against a tribe, then you made the

17

decision that that action was barred by

18

sovereign immunity.

19

Mills and Lewis v. Clarke, you clarified that

20

an individual action against a tribal employee

21

would potentially give relief to an innocent

22

victim.

23

So, subsequent to Bay

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, how does

24

that work in the -- yes, an individual action,

25

I remember that from Lewis and Clarke, but how

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1

does that work here?

2

supposed to sue anybody from the tribe who goes

3

on to the area that they claim to have adverse

4

possession of?

5

Are the Lundgrens

MR. HAWKINS:

If they were able to

6

frame the -- the claim properly, Lewis v.

7

Clarke may provide them relief in that

8

instance, yes.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So every time

10

somebody from the tribe goes over the barbed

11

wire fence that they say for -- since time

12

immemorial has defined their property, they

13

should sue them?

14

walking down -- along the line every time

15

somebody goes, serve him with process?

Just have a lawyer there

16

MR. HAWKINS:

I understand -­

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is that a

18

valid -- a viable alternative remedy to a quiet

19

title action?

20

MR. HAWKINS:

It is not.

But, again,

21

I get back to the point that this Court has

22

continually affirmed as relates to the

23

significance of sovereign immunity.

24

This Court -­

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Hawkins -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Does it make any

2

difference that the -- that the Lundgrens had

3

no notice when they bought the property that

4

there was any tribe in the picture?

5

see if the Lundgrens bought the property and a

6

tribe is already there.

7

I could

But why shouldn't the tribe, when it's

8

taking from someone who doesn't have any

9

immunity, step into the shoes of that person

10

and be disabled from asserting sovereign

11

immunity against someone who had no reason to

12

believe that there was an Indian tribe in the

13

picture?

14

MR. HAWKINS:

Justice Ginsburg, in -­

15

in -- in the instance where a case had already

16

been started, the tribe would step into

17

litigation and its immunity would not apply

18

because the jurisdiction of the court would

19

have already been asserted over the

20

proceedings.

21
22
23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

No, I -- I mean

there are no proceedings in court.
MR. HAWKINS:

But -- but -- but -- but

24

if there is no proceedings that are at issue

25

and the tribe purchases a property, the -- the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

tribe is exercising the rights that it has to

2

defend its claim against the Lundgrens.

3

Keep in mind the Lundgrens assert that

4

they've had this property for over 40 years,

5

never paying property taxes on it, never taking

6

any action for that period of time to legally

7

establish their claims.

8

sudden, when the tribe comes in to title, they

9

assert that they have a right.

And now, all of a

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well -­

Counsel -­
-- they -­

13

there -- the trial judge in the state said he

had never seen a case of adverse possession

15

clearer than this one.

arguing the merits of their adverse possession

claim and they would love to have you do that

18

in court.

19

MR. HAWKINS:

It seems to me you're

I don't mean to get into

20

the merits of the state case, Your Honor.

21

is -- sovereign immunity is a federal issue

22

that preempts the state law and the merits of

23

the underlying decision as it pertains to that.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

This

Mr. Hawkins, I mean, I

guess the question is, what is sovereign

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

immunity and what does it entail?

2

the footnote in Bay Mills that the Chief

3

Justice referenced, I think when you look at

4

language of the kind that appears in Bay Mills

5

and in other cases, what -- which says that,

6

you know, if Congress wants to change it, it's

7

up to Congress to change it, but the question

8

is, what is the "it"?

9

Even beyond

In other words, what's up to Congress

10

to change is deviations from the general law of

11

sovereign immunity.

12

Lundgrens are saying here is that this is not

13

part of the general law of sovereign immunity.

14

And this goes back to Justice Ginsburg's

15

question, that sovereign immunity typically, by

16

common law and historically, includes this

17

exception for immovable property.

18

And I think what the

And so that's the baseline.

It's,

19

well, sovereign immunity, as it historically

20

exists, except as it historically exists, it

21

just didn't include immunity from suits that

22

related to immovable property.

23

MR. HAWKINS:

So, if you look at the

24

judicial history of the immovable property

25

issue and the -- in particular, as it pertains

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

to the cases involving foreign nations, the

2

Court took action at the guidance of the State

3

Department.

4

And the Court has consistently

5

deferred to the State Department, the political

6

branches, as to whether or not it will exercise

7

jurisdiction or it's prudent to exercise

8

jurisdiction over those foreign sovereigns.

9

So the -- the Court has consistently

10

recognized that immunity is in the hands of the

11

political branches.

12

relate to Indian tribes and the significance

13

and what is "it".

14

the Upper Skagit, sovereign immunity has

15

enabled it to purchase lands, take them into

16

trust, and establish their reservation,

17

providing services for their members, without

18

being subject to third-party claims.

19

Now you ask how does this

For a landless tribe like

That's essential where we are, because

20

if you allow third parties to bring frivolous

21

or meritorious claims against a tribe, the

22

purse of the tribe is going to be spent on

23

things -­

24
25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

along those lines, do you think you'd have a

17

stronger case if the land had been taken into

2

trust?

3

understand it, in 2013.

4

5

And the land is purchased, as I

of getting everything ready for taking it into

trust, but, first of all, I'm sorry, to answer

trust or whether it's in fee, immunity travels

a note that the tribe determines that they're

answer to my question, though.

9

Yes.

make sense, tell me why not.
MR. HAWKINS:

No, I -- I -- I think I

3

understand the question, Your Honor.

4

-- and the Minnesota case is a situation where

5

you have the land taken into trust and

6

Minnesota then sues the U.S., and the Court

7

finds that it's barred by sovereign immunity

8

because the hand -- the land is held in trust

9

on the -- for the benefit of the tribe.

10

And the

But the reality is that the immunity

11

isn't subject to what the particular

transaction is.

13

that immunity applies regardless of what the -­

14

the -- the action is.

15

is being sought against the tribe because of

16

the significance of it.

17

able to preclude suits from it, it could be

18

subject to countless claims, taking away the

19

ability to provide for its membership.

20

Your case law has been clear

It applies if the relief

Were the tribe not

Counsel, can I

22

property argument which was just raised in the

What more could you show us

5

common law, but what else could you show us if

6

we gave you more time?

7

MR. HAWKINS:

That is difficult to

8

answer, not being -- not having had the time to

9

go back and look at what the law provides and

10

all of the cases that would be applicable here.

11

But what I would assert is that when you delve

12

into the application of that proposed exception

13

here, it is inherently in conflict with the

14

underlying request that they have made in their

merits brief.

20

question.

21

that could help you prove your argument?

22

I'm asking you a very directed

What other research would you do

MR. HAWKINS:

We would like -- we

23

would take the time to look at the application

24

as it relates to other tribes specifically, but

25

also how the state has -- the political

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
21
1

branches have been involved in that process and

2

how the U.S. has addressed it.

3

And the -- the reality is that giving

4

context to an exception to sovereign immunity

5

is a very complex matter, and how that applies

6

to tribes is a very complex matter.

7

not something that we, in a very short period

8

of time, were fully able to respond to.

9
10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You had -- you

had a month since they filed their brief.

11
12

And it's

MR. HAWKINS:

That is correct, Your

Honor.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Suppose you just

14

said:

Well, the tribe, being of the dignity of

15

a sovereign, has the same kind of immunity as a

16

sovereign nation would have?

17
18
19

MR. HAWKINS:

That is -- that is our

position.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I don't know.

20

A sovereign nation, I think since about 1750,

21

there's been an exception for a sovereign

22

nation for immovable property.

23

if the nation of Canada comes and -- and has a

24

piece of land in North Dakota and the person

25

who lives there says, I'm sorry, this belongs

And, therefore,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
22
1

to me, not to Canada, and Canada says no, my

2

understanding was there has been a

3

long-standing exception to sovereign immunity.

4

MR. HAWKINS:

But that exception has

5

been at the direction of the political

6

branches.

7

asserting should occur here, should an

8

exception be considered by this Court.

9
10

If there are no further questions, I'd
like to reserve time for rebuttal.

11

14

And that is exactly what we are

Thank you,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL

15

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

16

IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONER

17
18

MS. O'CONNELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

19

I'd like to start with Justice Kagan's

20

questions about what is the baseline here about

21

what sovereign immunity entails.

22

is sovereign immunity from suit.

23

The baseline

This is the Alexander Hamilton quote

24

from the Federalist Papers:

"It is inherent in

25

the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable"

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
23
1

to suit without consent.

2

The immovable property exception is an

3

exception that applies to other sovereigns, but

4

that's because an exception to that general

5

rule has been made.

6

In the United States, the political

7

branches control whether there are exceptions

8

to that general rule of sovereign immunity from

9

suit for the United States, for foreign states,

10
11
12
13

and for Indian tribes.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, you say it's

been made -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, of course,

14

this Court said in the Permanent Mission of

15

India case that the Foreign Sovereign

16

Immunities Act was meant "to codify the

17

preexisting real property exception to

18

sovereign immunity recognized by international

19

practice."

20

MS. O'CONNELL:

Correct.

It was

21

recognized by international practice as a

22

matter of what the executive branch recognized

23

when it was asserting immunity -­

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And so why doesn't

that same principle allow the Court to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
24
1

recognize that there's a limit to sovereign

2

immunity here under the very same principle?

3

MS. O'CONNELL:

Well, I -- I think

4

that's because it is -- it is up to Congress -­

5

this Court has consistently said it's up to

6

Congress to control and make exceptions to the

7

immunity from suit of Indian tribes.

8
9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So -­

But I thought that we

explained in Kiowa that foreign sovereign

10

immunity actually started as a judicial

11

doctrine.

12

over by the political branches.

13

It was only later that it was taken

MS. O'CONNELL:

Well, I think what the

14

Court said there, and I think that that quote

15

was in -- well, I can't remember if it's

16

initially in Verlinden B.V. or Kiowa, but that

17

the -- the initial judicial doctrine was from

18

The Schooner Exchange versus McFaddon, was that

19

it -- it's general immunity from suit.

20

the general rule, that it's -­

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's

But it doesn't say in

22

the -- in the -- I mean, my law clerk has here,

23

which I guess he got out of the briefs, I don't

24

know, we have Vattel, Cornelius Van Bynkershoek

25

in 1744, as well as Lauterpacht, who's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

certainly big authority.

2

exceptions.

3

Bynkershoek -- he says -- he says -- or maybe

4

it's the other one -- he says in -- in

5

sovereign -- several sovereigns have fiefs and

6

other possessions in the territory of another

7

prince.

8

in the manner of private individuals.

9

They don't talk about

They just say a prince -- that's

In such case -- cases, they hold them

And then we have Vattel and all these

10

others, and they say the same thing really.

11

They don't talk about exceptions or not

12

exceptions.

13

what was the law of sovereign immunity in 1760,

14

you know, I guess you'd have to say the law is

15

that the prince buys a department store in

16

Iowa, I'm sorry, he's just like another Iowan.

17

So, if you were to have a quiz,

MS. O'CONNELL:

I'm not -- I'm not

18

sure that any of those sources are talking

19

about sovereign immunity from suit.

20

those quotes could equally apply to whether the

21

prince has to pay property taxes, whether the

22

land is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction

23

of the state, as opposed to you could sue the

24

foreign nation in court.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean,

But if you look at two

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
26
1

cases, Ms. O'Connell, one is Schooner Exchange,

2

which talks about foreign states, and then the

3

other is this Georgia v. Chattanooga, which is

4

individual states in another state's

5

jurisdiction, I mean, both of those seem to be

6

indicating that there's this long-standing rule

7

that when the prince goes someplace else and

8

buys land there, he's just going to be treated

9

like anybody else.

10

MS. O'CONNELL:

I -­

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And it doesn't have

12

much to do with any kind of executive action.

13

It doesn't have much to do with the states all

14

agreeing about something at the Constitutional

15

Convention.

16

It's just a sort of rule that when the

17

prince pops up in some other jurisdiction and

18

buys a piece of land, he's no longer the

19

prince.

20

MS. O'CONNELL:

That, Justice Kagan, I

21

think is an exception to the general rule of

22

immunity from suit.

23

exception in Permanent Mission of India.

24

Congress certainly called it an exception in

25

the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, where it

This Court called it an

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
27
1

lays out that the baseline rule is that

2

sovereigns are completely immune from suit

3

unless an exception applies.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess what my point

5

is -- is not whether it should be denominated

6

an exception or not an exception but whether

7

this is the kind of historic, traditional,

8

long-standing rule that we -- we shouldn't

9

expect Congress to have to put in, that it just

10

sort of goes into the doctrine because that is

11

part of the doctrine from long, long ago, which

12

is a very different thing from saying, look,

13

it's up to Congress to really -- to -- to

14

treat -- you know, to -- to -- to start

15

modifying terms of the doctrine that have

16

existed for a long time.

17

MS. O'CONNELL:

To the contrary, I

18

think that Congress's ability to create a

19

comprehensive exception or solution here and

20

weigh the policy interests on both sides is

21

what should counsel this Court not to begin

22

recognizing judicial exceptions to sovereign

23

immunity from suit in court.

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, of course, you

call it, again, as Justice Kagan's indicated,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
28
1

you call it an exception.

2

just a limit to the general rule.

3

MS. O'CONNELL:

4
5
6
7

Others may call it

Right.

But I think

the -- the point I -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So that's just

playing with words.
MS. O'CONNELL:

The point I want to

8

make is that, you know, when Congress passed

9

the Quiet Title Act to deal with this exception

10

from immunity from suit for suits against the

11

United States, it made various policy

12

judgments; the suits could only be brought in

13

federal court, it imposed a statute of

14

limitations, it made exceptions for adverse

15

possession claims, for water rights.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Under your view of

17

this case, suppose the tribe, on land that it

18

owns in a state but outside the reservation,

19

puts up a high-rise building in violation of

20

the zoning law.

21

They can -- they can develop anywhere without

22

reference to zoning laws?

23

They're -- they're exempt?

MS. O'CONNELL:

They're not exempt

24

from the regulatory jurisdiction of the state,

25

if it's just fee land, but the -- the immunity

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
29
1
2

from suit would still attach.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Ms. O'Connell, I -­

3

I have been hoping to hear from you about what

4

the baseline rule was versus the exceptions.

5

And I'm still hopeful we might get an answer to

6

that question.

7

Why do you -- and what's your best

8

authority for the proposition that the baseline

9

rule of common law was total immunity,

10
11

including in rem actions?
MS. O'CONNELL:

I -- I think it's the

12

Federalist Papers, the Hamilton quote from the

13

Federalist Papers.

14

versus McFaddon lays that out as a general rule

15

for foreign states at least.

16

Also, Schooner Exchange

But, again, I think that one important

17

point that I want to get out here is that if

18

Congress were to look at this and -- and decide

19

whether to create a judicial -- or a statutory

20

exception for tribal sovereign immunity, it may

21

very well make decisions like it made with

22

respect to the United States about a statute of

23

limitations or exceptions for adverse

24

possession claims or things that Congress is in

25

a position to weigh and create a comprehensive

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
30
1

solution.

2

I think there would be -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Ms.

3

O'Connell,one -- there was one sentence in your

4

brief that really leapt off the page, for me

5

anyway.

6

where you say the Respondents, the Lundgrens,

7

you're asking, well, what alternatives do they

8

have?

9

example, log trees on the disputed strip,

It's the one between pages 23 and 24

And you say the Lundgrens could, for

10

commence building a structure, or take other

11

similar actions that would induce Petitioner to

12

file suit.

13

Is that really what you want them to

14

do?

There's a dispute about this piece of

15

property and you say:

16

Go cut down some trees.

17

MS. O'CONNELL:

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, go pick a fight.

I think that -­
That's a

19

surprising position for -- for the government

20

to take.

21

MS. O'CONNELL:

That -- that

22

alternative way of resolving the dispute is

23

laid out in this Court's decision in Block

24

versus North Dakota.

25

said, even though the state's claim against the

In that case, the Court

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
31
1

United States to quiet title to land was barred

2

by the statute of limitations, that didn't mean

3

4

could continue to assert its right to the

5

property and force the sovereign to sue you.

6

So -­

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The state

So -- so if -­

8

and -- and the tribe, I gather, said they're

9

going to build their own fence right on the

10

line and you're saying the Lundgrens should

11

jump over the fence with a chain saw and start

12

cutting down trees, and when the tribe comes up

13

to them, they're supposed to say:

14

O'Connell said I should do this.

15

MS. O'CONNELL:

16

they probably shouldn't say that.

17

(Laughter.)

18

MS. O'CONNELL:

Oh, Ms.

I think the -- well,

The -- the point that

19

we're trying to make here is that when a suit

20

is dismissed because the sovereign has immunity

21

when a quiet title suit is dismissed in those

22

circumstances, it doesn't mean that the tribe

23

now owns the land.

24

settled.

25

It means title is still not

And so the -- the Lundgrens could

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
32
1

continue to assert their -- their ownership of

2

the property and force the tribe to quiet

3

title.

4

point out there is that the -- the land into

trust process is another way that this dispute

6

could still be resolved in this particular

7

case.

8

intention of asking the United States to take

9

the land into trust for the Indian tribe.

And I think one other thing I'd like to

The tribe bought this land with the

In

10

that process, the tribe has to present the -­

11

the Secretary of the Interior with its deed and

12

with title insurance, and then the Secretary

13

conducts an investigation to see if there are

14

any infirmities to the title.

15

And so, in this case, obviously, there

16

is another claim to the land and the Secretary

17

would require the tribe to get that settled,

18

either through a negotiation or through its own

19

quiet title action, before that strip could be

20

taken.

MS. O'CONNELL:

States.

18

There would be an adverse possession

So -- so what -- what
I did
It's

All right.

So, in the meantime, tribes, not

19

necessarily this one, but many tribes have

20

business interests all over the country.

21

-- and so how -- how -- how do these in

22

practice -- how are they getting resolved if

23

there's sovereign immunity all over the place?

24

What happens?

25

MS. O'CONNELL:

And

Congress does step in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
34

from time to time.

So there are certain

2

statutes where Congress has abrogated tribal

3

sovereign immunity with respect to specific

4

water settlement agreements or required the

5

tribe to waive its immunity in order to

6

exercise statutory jurisdiction under various

7

statutes, but, you know, the -- I think the

8

Footnote -- the Footnote 8 problem in Bay Mills

9

doesn't come up here because, unlike a tort

10

plaintiff that's just out of luck if it can't

11

sue the tribe because of immunity, title is not

settled here.

ORAL ARGUMENT ON BEHALF OF ERIC D. MILLER

20

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

21
22

MR. MILLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

23

The core attribute of sovereignty is

24

the authority to adjudicate disputes over the

25

ownership of real property within the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

sovereign's territory.

That authority is not

2

displaced simply because another sovereign

3

claims an interest in the property.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Miller, this

5

was -- this is an argument that you have

6

pressed vigorously here, but it has nothing to

7

do with the decision of the Washington Supreme

8

Court.

9

property exception.

10

There was nothing about immovable

So are you defending -- are you

11

presenting an alternative while at the same

12

time defending what the Washington Supreme

13

Court decided?

14

what they decided, this immovable property

15

exemption takes care of it?

16

Or are you saying, never mind

MR. MILLER:

We -- we are defending

17

the holding of the court below, set out at

18

pages 7A to 11A of the Petition Appendix under

19

the heading "In Rem Jurisdiction," and what the

20

court below said is that the courts of

21

Washington have in rem jurisdiction to resolve

22

disputes over real property within the State of

23

Washington.

24
25

And I think to -- to understand what
that means, you have to look at this court's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
36
1

decision in Shaffer against Heitner, and that

2

explains that the difference between an in rem

3

and an in personam action, it's not about

4

pleading or who the defendant is or how you

5

write the caption, there's a substantive

6

difference and it turns on the source of the

7

court's authority -­

8
9

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But, counsel,

Justice Ginsburg's question, I -- I really

10

would appreciate an answer to that because it

11

troubles me too.

12

relied on this Court's decision in Yakima and

13

said that there was no impediment to suit.

14

The State of Washington

But Yakima, of course, was just an

15

interpretation of the General Allotment Act and

16

had nothing to do with in rem authority writ

17

large, and I didn't see anything in your brief

18

defending the reasoning of the Washington

19

Supreme Court and its analysis of Yakima.

20

So can we just put that aside and

21

agree that that was wrong and then move on to

22

the arguments you've really pressed in your

23

brief?

24
25

MR. MILLER:

Well, we -- we agree

that, you know, Yakima was a -- a statutory

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
37
1
2
3
4

case.

Its holding is not controlling here.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Okay, all right.

That's -- that -- I appreciate that concession.
MR. MILLER:

Yeah, I mean, I -- I -- I

5

would say, however, that Yakima reflects an

6

understanding that there is a difference

7

between control over property and -­

8
9

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But -- fine.

But

you agree that Yakima doesn't control?

10

MR. MILLER:

Yes, yes.

11

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Okay.

All right.

12

And in that case, why isn't it enough for the

13

day for this Court to resolve a split of

14

authority over whether Yakima controls in cases

15

like this and return it to the Washington

16

Supreme Court, where you can present all these

17

wonderful arguments you've raised here for the

18

first time?

19
20
21

MR. MILLER:

Well, a couple reasons,

Your Honor.
First of all, you know, the -- the

22

argument that we are presenting is a response

23

to the argument that Petitioner has presented.

24

So Petitioner's argument in their opening

25

brief, it's very clear and straightforward and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
38
1

it has two parts -­

2

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

No, I -- I

3

understand that.

4

question, though, remains, you've raised a new

5

ground for defending the result below and

6

abandoned the ground that was actually

7

asserted.

8
9

I spot you all of that.

My

This Court doesn't normally resolve
questions like that in the first instance.

10

Normally, it's a question of review, not first

11

view.

12

here and wait?

13

Why shouldn't we exercise discretion

MR. MILLER:

Well, again, you know, a

14

couple additional reasons.

First, you know,

15

although the court below did not use the

16

language of the immovable property rule, its

17

references to in rem jurisdiction, its emphasis

18

on, you know, its authority over land within

19

the State of Washington, necessarily

20

encompasses the same -­

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

22

MR. MILLER:

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I don't think that -­

-- concepts that -­
-- that's quite true,

24

Mr. Miller, unless -- I mean, tell me if I'm

25

wrong, but I made a little Venn diagram for

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
39
1

myself, and it turns out that immovable

2

property and in rem jurisdiction, there's a

3

large sphere of overlap, but there are

4

definitely places where the two do not overlap.

5

So, you know, you have your in rem

6

about land, that's this sphere of overlap, but

7

you can have immovable property that the action

8

is about land and have an in personam suit,

9

that -- tjat would be a typical trespass,

10
11

something like that.
And then, on the other side, you could

12

have an in rem suit that's about movable

13

property or you could have an in rem suit

14

that's about land within the jurisdiction.

15

that would not fall within the sphere -- with

16

-- excuse me, within the reservation itself,

17

within the Indian reservation, and that would

18

not fall within the sphere of overlap.

19

And

So I think that there are real

20

differences in the scope of the immovable

21

property exception on the one hand and an in

22

rem exception on the other hand.

23

clearly, the Washington court talked about the

24

in rem exception.

25

have an extremely strong argument about this

And -- and,

Now you're coming in and you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
40
1

immovable property rule, but it's not the same

2

argument that the court in Washington made.

3

It's not the same theory as Justice

4

Gorsuch pointed out.

5

same categorization.

6

MR. MILLER:

It's also just not the

With -- with respect,

7

Your Honor, I think it is the same

8

categorization and I -- I want to explain why.

9

So, to take the -- the second part of the Venn

10

diagram, it is true in the abstract that in rem

11

jurisdiction can be more than immovable

12

property, you know, in admiralty and bankruptcy

13

and so forth.

14

below, there are 34 references to land.

15

There's nothing about boats.

16

But if you read the decision

The -- the first sentence of the

17

substantive part of the analysis begins with

18

the statement that the superior court has

19

jurisdiction in actions -- in rem jurisdiction

20

in actions involving real property.

21

fairest reading of the decision below is -­

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23

MR. MILLER:

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

So the

Even if it's land -­

-- focused -­
-- there's still a

question of where is the land, is the land on

the reservation or is the land outside the

2

reservation?

3

reservation, I took you to agree with the point

4

that that's the prince's land, and so the

5

prince would be immune from suit.

6

If the land is on the

MR. MILLER:

Well, two points on that,

7

Your Honor.

First, in the brief in opposition,

8

in our formulation of the question presented,

9

we emphasized that the case involved

10

off-reservation land.

11

clarification at that stage.

12

So we -- we raised that

On reservation land, the analysis

13

would be somewhat different.

14

on -- and the Court doesn't need to resolve

15

that, but if it's fee land on the reservation,

16

we read Plains Commerce Bank to say that that

17

is land that is not subject to tribal

18

jurisdiction, because -­

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If it is fee land

I guess what I'm

20

saying is that it becomes much -- a -- a

21

different question, a more complicated question

22

if you ask about a broad in rem exception or,

23

you know, in some ways the in rem exception is

24

broader, in some ways it's narrower.

25

It just becomes a different question

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
42
1

if you ask about in rem exception, one which

2

does take you into this question of:

3

happens if the land is on the reservation?

4

Then, if you say:

5

property rule, if one sovereign owns land in

6

another sovereign's territory, that sovereign

7

is subject to suit there.

10

What

Look, under the immovable

That's not -- that's not a general in
rem question.

It's a question about the

immovable property rule.

11

MR. MILLER:

But -- but, you know,

12

given -- you know, going back to what I said

13

earlier about, you know, under Shaffer, what -­

14

what in rem jurisdiction is, it reflects an

15

exercise of the power of the foreign state over

16

the property.

17

off-reservation land, in rem jurisdiction is an

18

exercise of the sovereign's power over -­

And when you're talking about

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

If you're -­

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Miller, it's

21

odd that you bring up Shaffer against Heitner

22

because the whole effort in that case was to

23

say:

24

why we divided things into in personam and in

25

rem, but this Court said we wanted to make it

Yeah, there's an historical understanding

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
43
1

clear that the notion that things have any

2

rights is fanciful, anything is a claim

3

involving a person, that is, people have rights

4

in things.

5

So Shaffer said in the old style in

6

rem proceedings, you will have to meet -­

7

you'll have to show the same kinds of

8

connections to the lawsuit that you would have

9

to show for in personam.

10

So the whole message, I think, of

11

Shaffer against Heitner is to break down that

12

distinction and say we recognize that

13

litigation is against contending humans or

14

entities and we should not have different

15

connections for in rem versus in personam.

16

MR. MILLER:

Well, that -- we -- we

17

agree with that.

18

that case teaches is that there can be

19

different sources of the Court's power.

20

and the Court addressed -- you know, obviously,

21

that case was about the quasi-in rem

22

jurisdiction where you're just using the

23

property as a hook to regulate some other

24

activity of -- of the defendant.

25

But none -- nonetheless, what

But the Court had an extended

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And -­

Official
44
1

discussion of the traditional in rem case that

2

we're talking about and said that, you know, in

3

a case where, you know, the dispute is about

4

property within the foreign state, the -- the

5

con -- minimum contacts test of International

6

Shoe is pretty much automatically going to be

7

qualified because of -- be satisfied because of

8

the state's strong interest in assuring the

9

marketability of property within its borders

10

and in providing a procedure for peaceful

11

resolution of disputes about the possession of

12

that property.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

I thought that the -­

14

that Justice Ginsburg's question which started

15

off this line of questioning was essentially

16

this:

17

immovable property exception.

18

exist or doesn't apply in this situation.

19

Suppose there were no such thing as the
It just doesn't

Would the decision of the Washington

20

Supreme Court be correct based on the in rem

21

theory?

22
23

MR. MILLER:

If there were -- I mean,

no, it would not.

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

25

MR. MILLER:

Okay.

But -- but I -- as I've

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

been explaining, the in rem theory, you know,

2

ultimately refers to the same underlying

3

concepts about the foreign's power.

4

we made this point in the brief.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And -- and

But Mr. -- this is the

6

way I sort of see what's happened in this case,

7

and, again, you can tell me if I'm wrong.

8

you took over this case and you read this

9

opinion and you said this is not a very good

10

theory.

11

(Laughter.)

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

There is a really good

13

theory here, and I'm going to make that.

14

that's what good lawyers do.

15

criticizing you.

16

But

And

I'm not at all

It's just it's a new theory and a new

17

-- it's not just even a new argument.

18

just a new -- it's a completely new way to win

19

this case.

20

MR. MILLER:

It's

Well -- I -- we -- we

21

took over the case and read the other side's

22

brief and Petitioner's brief says:

23

should be treated just like other sovereigns

24

and other sovereigns would be immune in this

25

kind of case.

And we're saying:

Tribes

No, they

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
46
1

wouldn't.

2

And -­
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, but you -­

3

that's not quite right, though, because we know

4

the United States would be immune from this

5

suit, right?

6
7
8
9

MR. MILLER:

No, Your Honor, because

-JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, adverse

possession, I think we -- everyone acknowledges

10

that the United States would not be subject to

11

a suit like that.

12

that's wrong in response to Justice Ginsburg's

13

line of inquiry.

14

Maybe you can tell me why

But it -- assuming it -- it could be

15

immune, here, if the land were in trust, it

16

would be the same as the United States' land.

17

And so it is possible that a sovereign could be

18

immune from this kind of suit, right?

19

MR. MILLER:

If -- if the land were in

20

trust, the sovereign immunity of the United

21

States would bar the suit.

22

say the United States would not be immune from

23

this kind of suit is this is a suit challenging

24

title to property owned by one sovereign within

25

the territory of another.

But the reason I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

2

MR. MILLER:

3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I -- I understand.

So the analogy is -­
But if this were in

4

trust and, therefore, property of the United

5

States, you'd agree sovereign immunity would

6

bar this suit?

7

MR. MILLER:

Yes, the -- the Quiet

8

Title Act's exception for trust or restricted

9

Indian lands would -- would bar it.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I -- as

11

Justice Kagan suggested, you know, you're -­

12

you're a good lawyer, but you're not the one

13

who came up with this the first time in this

14

litigation, were you?

15

raised the immovable property argument in its

16

brief.

17
18
19

MR. MILLER:

I mean, the government

That's -- that's

absolutely right, Your Honor, they did -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Did that happen

20

because you had a conversation with the

21

Solicitor General -­

you were going to make?

MR. MILLER:

We had a conversation

JUSTICE BREYER:

Look, sending it back

-- sending it back, I think it is a -- we could

try to decide it or we could say:

first view, all right?

8

ways in my mind is this, that reading the words

9

"immunity from suit" broadly, extending where

Review, not

So one of the things -­

10

not even Canada would dare to go, all right,

11

there's a lot of language in cases that does

say that.

anyone else is, but I'm pretty curious, for the

14

last 20 years, how have things gone?

So why shouldn't we send it back and

get all this out on the table and, you know, we

-- we have the views of other courts and we

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
49
1
2

also have a more extensive set of arguments?
MR. MILLER:

Well, because what -­

3

what has happened is that there is a conflict

4

in the lower courts, and these issues have been

5

fully ventilated in -- in the lower courts.

6
7
8
9

So the -- the other state high court
decision on the same side as Washington, is -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, I'm

actually quite interested in that because I

10

went to look.

11

what Yakima means or doesn't mean.

12

know that the courts below have been looking at

13

this immovable property theory.

14

There is a split on Yakima and

MR. MILLER:

But I don't

Well, the -- the other

15

state high court decision on the same side as

16

Washington is the North Dakota decision in Cass

17

County and Joint Water Resources District, and

18

that has a several-paragraph discussion of

19

Georgia against Chattanooga.

20

-- the concept is there in the -- in the

21

decisions below.

22

So, you know, the

On the other side of the split, the

leading case is the Second Circuit's decision

in Oneida against Madison County.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. MILLER:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So -­

-- but -­
-- if we let it go

5

back, it's going to get aired fully and we'll

6

have a split -­

7

MR. MILLER:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

you.

Well, you -­
-- according to

Might or might not have a split.

That

10

would require us to take the case again on this

11

theory, but it still doesn't explain why we

12

shouldn't follow our normal practice and just

13

say relying on Yakima is wrong, and there might

14

be something else, but, you know, you'll take

15

care of it -­

16

MR. MILLER:

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

Well, I mean, because -­
-- in that first

instance.

19

MR. MILLER:

-- because you already -­

20

I mean, you already have a split in which these

21

issues have been ventilated in the lower

22

courts.

23

the lower court's decision wasn't just County

24

of Yakima.

25

state's authority over land within the state.

You have an issue here that, you know,

You know, it was also about the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
51
1

And we made that point in the brief in

2

opposition at -- at page 6.

3

state's jurisdiction to control the ownership

4

and disposition of real property within its

5

territory is a core sovereign prerogative.

6

That's exactly the same idea, just less

7

memorably phrased, as -- as then-Judge Scalia's

8

observation in Reclamantes about a territorial

9

sovereign's primeval interest in controlling

10

We said that a

real property within -- in its domain.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What -- what

12

would be -- what's your objection, that -- the

13

tribe has suggested that you wait until the

14

trust proceedings, at which time you'll have an

15

opportunity to object to the government's

16

taking the property in trust because you'd say

17

part of it is ours.

18

that?

19

MR. MILLER:

What -- what's wrong with

Well, we -- we -- we

20

would object, and under the land and trust

21

regulations, the existence of this -- you know,

22

the existence of this encumbrance on -- on the

23

title would -- should preclude taking the land

24

into trust, but if we -- if we succeed, we

25

convince the Secretary not to take the land

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
52
1

into trust, that doesn't actually get us

2

anything.

3

We -- we still have the tribe

4

asserting an interest in land that under state

5

law belongs to us.

6

cloud on the title.

7

non-marketable.

8

immediate and concrete injury for which

9

Washington law, like the law of pretty much

10

And that is a -- that's a
It makes the title

And that is a -- a real

every state, provides a remedy.

11

Because it -- you know, all -- all

12

this -- you know, the discussion of sort of

13

sovereignty can be a little bit abstract, but

14

there's a real -- real practical reality

15

underlying it and that's that, you know, every

16

government and really every organized society

17

has an interest in having some mechanism for

18

determining who owns what pieces of land.

19

And the tribe's position would create

20

situations, you know, like -- like this one

21

where that's impossible.

22

position would also undermine the ability of

23

the state to acquire land that's needed for

24

public use.

25

The -- the tribe's

And -- and, Justice Alito, you asked a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
53
1

hypothetical about blocking a condemnation

2

that's -- that's not hypothetical at all.

3

North Dakota case I mentioned earlier was a

4

case where they were going to build a dam and

5

they had plotted out the area that was going to

6

be flooded by the dam.

7

one and a half acres in the middle of that area

8

and then attempted to assert its immunity to

9

block the entire project.

10

The

And the tribe purchased

So that's -- and North Dakota went -­

11

went the same way as Washington and rejected

12

that assertion of immunity, but that's the sort

13

of thing that one would expect to happen under

14

the rule.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Does the record show

16

-- this parcel of land is about an acre, is

17

that correct?

18
19
20
21
22
23

MR. MILLER:

That's correct, Your

Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Does the record show

what it's worth?
MR. MILLER:

No, I don't -- I don't

believe there's anything in the record on that.

24

The -- as I said earlier, you know,

25

this argument has been presented in response

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
54
1

to, you know, the argument that Petitioner made

2

that they should be treated like other

3

sovereigns.

4

they said, it's what this Court has said.

5

As, Justice Kagan, you mentioned

And, you know, it's not just what

6

earlier that, you know, under Bay Mills and

7

under Santa Clara Pueblo, what tribal sovereign

8

immunity is is the common law immunity from

9

suit traditionally enjoyed by sovereign powers.

10

So, you know, if the Court is going to

11

consider, you know, what cases fall within the

12

scope of sovereign immunity, it -- it has to do

13

that by reference to, you know, what the

14

traditional rules are for other sovereigns and

15

--

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yeah, I mean, as I

17

said, I -- I think you have a -- a pretty

18

strong, not -- you know, it looks pretty good

19

to me right now.

20

(Laughter.)

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I -- I -- I am a

22

little bit worried about what Justice Sotomayor

23

said, which is, you know -- you know, if we

24

really looked harder, maybe there would be

25

something else that would cut against this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
55
1
2

theory.
I'm a little bit worried that there

3

aren't amici who knew about this theory.

4

only one who did is really the Solicitor

5

General, because the Solicitor General

6

generally talks to parties as the litigation

7

goes forward.

8
9

The

And I think it would be, I have to
say, just a bad way of dealing on our part if

10

we allowed parties to come in, even with the

11

best of faith, and said I have a new theory for

12

you that -- that really the only people who got

13

a chance to reply are the Petitioners in a

14

20-page yellow brief.

15

MR. MILLER:

Well, I mean, I think the

16

-- the issue was out there.

17

the cases cited in the petition for writ of

18

certiorari would have been aware of, you know,

19

these concepts.

20

in the North Dakota opinion.

21

expressed by Petitioners in the Madison County

22

case when -- when this Court -- from the Second

23

Circuit, when this Court granted cert, you

24

know, seven years ago.

25

Anyone who read

They're -- they're expressed
They were

So anybody who is looking at the legal

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
56
1

landscape of what the circuit conflict was

2

would have been aware of these issues.

3

who read the decision below and -- and looked

4

at the Court's references to in rem

5

jurisdiction and asked themselves, you know,

6

what does it mean to say that a state has, you

7

know, in rem jurisdiction to exercise power

8

over the land within its sovereign domain would

9

have been aware of the issue.

10

Anybody

And anyone who read this Court's

11

decision in City of Sherrill, which, you know,

12

doesn't address this precise question presented

13

but goes a long way toward saying that, you

14

know, when you have land that's within a state,

15

the fact that a tribe has, you know, come along

16

and purchased it on the open market does not

17

divest the state of sovereignty.

18

subject to state sovereignty, not tribal

19

sovereignty.

20

It's still

You know, all of those things that

21

were out there, you know, should have put

22

parties on notice, you know, as -- and, in

23

addition, the -- you know, the foundational

24

principle that, as I said earlier, you know,

25

the scope of sovereign immunity under this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
57
1

Court's precedents is determined by reference

2

to the law that governs other sovereigns.

3

I mean, just last year in Lewis, you

4

know, the Court applied that understanding of

5

how sovereign immunity works.

6

where the tribe came in and asserted that its

7

sovereign immunity barred the suit.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

That was a case

That might be fair.

9

I mean, I see in terms of fairness between the

10

parties, but we have, you know, a dozen tribes

11

and the National Congress of -- of American

12

Indians and so forth, they all have an interest

13

in this.

14

And they'd have to say squarely why

15

should tribes have more immunity than Canada,

16

Mexico, whatever, and -- and I don't know that

17

they've addressed that squarely.

18

and that's -- that's -- that's what's sort of

19

moving me, to tell you the truth.

20

MR. MILLER:

Now they -­

I mean, they -- they -­

21

several -- certainly, Petitioners in their

22

opening brief, as well as several of the -- the

23

non-governmental amici did address that

24

question, and said that tribes should have the

25

same immunity as other sovereigns.

So, you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
58
1

know, they -- they have addressed that, I

2

think.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's on your side.

4

But do you think there -- there are also people

5

on their side?

6

MR. MILLER:

Well, no, I'm -- I'm

7

referring to the people on their side.

8

know -­

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

You

They got those

10

squarely in these three amici -- in the three,

11

you know, light green amicus briefs, which I

12

did look at, but I haven't looked at it with

13

that directly in mind.

14

MR. MILLER:

I -- I don't know that

15

they all did, but we -- we -- we cited a number

16

of them in -- I think it would be early in -­

--

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Miller, I -- I

20

-- you argue forcefully and you argue

21

intelligently, but I don't know why if it was

22

so obvious to everyone, and you didn't author

23

the brief in opposition to certiorari, but if

24

it was so obvious that this was the case, why

25

doesn't the brief mention the immovable

did the court below.

10

MR. MILLER:

It doesn't mention it -­
-- because neither

Yeah, it doesn't mention

11

it in terms -- I've -- I've cited to you the -­

12

you know, the -- the qualification of the

13

question presented in -- in the brief in

opposition that refers to off-reservation land.

15

The passage on page 6 that refers to

16

the -- the sovereign prerogative of the state,

17

which is just a -- I mean, it is not explicit,

18

but it is another way of getting at that

19

concept.

further questions, we ask that the judgment be

affirmed.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT ON DAVID S. HAWKINS

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

3

MR. HAWKINS:

It is fundamentally

4

Congress's jobs, not ours, to determine whether

5

or how to limit tribal sovereign immunity.

6

That comes from Bay Mills, 2037.

7

Justice Breyer, you asked how have

8

things gone over 20 years and how are these

9

issues addressed?

These issues are addressed

10

every day in contracts and in land transactions

11

by the tribe either agreeing to waive

12

voluntarily or negotiating how disputes will be

13

resolved.

14

So there is a mechanism, and that's

15

between the parties who understand their place.

16

Even in this situation, had the Lundgrens

17

offered an opportunity to negotiate in

18

recognition of the tribe's immunity from suit,

19

we would have not -- we would have engaged in

20

that same process here.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, there

22

was a negotiation, and I thought the

23

negotiation resulted in the tribe saying:

24

we want the land, we won't take money for it.

25

We won't exchange parcels for it.

The

Heritage Reporting Corporation

No,

Official

1

Lundgrens wanted to pay you money or exchange

2

parcels, and the tribe said no.

3

MR. HAWKINS:

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

Justice Sotomayor -­
So what were they

supposed to do next?

6

MR. HAWKINS:

There was an -- there -­

7

there -- what I said was if the Lundgrens

8

understood our immunity from suit, then the

9

negotiations would be different.

10
11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How?

When you

said no.

12

MR. HAWKINS:

Because they would not

13

have -- they would not have the opportunity to

14

seek the legal relief that they have sought

15

here.

16

below be reversed.

We respectfully ask that the judgment

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
counsel.

Thank you,

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:07 a.m., the case

was adjourned.)
