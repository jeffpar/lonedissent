ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW C. SIMPSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. SIMPSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, may

it please the Court:

11

Ever since the Judiciary Act of 1789,

12

there has been a right of appeal from a final

13

judgment.

14

right of appeal in this case because -- for

15

three reasons.

16

We ask that this Court support the

First, it comes from a final judgment

17

entered in the case.

18

rule that brooks no exception.

19

judgment is entered, you have a right of

20

appeal.

21

It provides a bright-line
When a final

Second, Rule 42 does not merge cases.

22

There's a careful architecture in the federal

23

rules from Rules 13 through Rule 24 designed to

24

bring cases that should be tried as one case

25

together.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

4
1

Rule 42, on the other hand, is for the

2

exceptional case that doesn't fall within the

3

categories that fall under Rules 13 through 24.

4

And -- and there's no reason for merger in

5

those cases.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Please explain to

7

me what the purpose of 42 -- dividing it up

8

into two sections is.

9

MR. SIMPSON:

10

Certain -- certainly.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because you don't

11

need the (b) section under your reading.

12

use the word "consolidate," which your

13

adversary points out generally has a

14

connotation of merging two things into one?

15

Why use it at all?

16

MR. SIMPSON:

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18
19

Why

I -­
What's the

necessity of it?
MR. SIMPSON:

I -- I think Rule

20

42(a)(1), which talks about joining for hearing

21

or trial, is designed for the case that the

22

judge wants to keep on separate tracks but has

23

a reason to have, say, an omnibus hearing;

24

whereas 42(a)(2) is for true consolidation,

25

whether it's for trial, for a hearing, or for

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

5
1

pretrial.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't understand

3

the necessity, meaning if we had only (a)(1),

4

the court could do exactly what you're saying

5

as well.

6

what (a)(1) already says it can.

7

to me that there's a separate purpose for

8

(a)(2).

9

It didn't need (a)(2) to accomplish

MR. SIMPSON:

It suggests

I -- I agree that there

10

is a separate purpose.

11

-- as Footnote 4 in the Ringwald case explains,

12

the old consolidation statute actually is

13

embodied in (a)(2) and (a)(3).

14

that is new.

15

before, and (a)(2) and (a)(3) continued the

16

consolidation.

17

I think, as -- in the

It's (a)(1)

So there was consolidation

What (a)(1) does is allow for, like -­

18

as I say, an omnibus hearing that -- where the

19

cases remain on separate tracks.

20

give an example of how that would work, suppose

21

there is a mass tort, a industrial explosion.

22

You have a class of plaintiffs, separate

23

actions, that are death cases.

24

who are terminally ill from this case, from

25

this explosion.

And if I can

You have some

You have some that have

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

6
1

property damage only.

2

The court might decide I'm going to

3

consolidate under (a)(2) the death cases and

4

the people who are terminal and the -- and the

5

-- and the property damage.

6

separate groups, three separate tack -- tracks.

7

So we have three

It makes sense to keep those cases

8

together and consolidate them under (a)(2), but

9

there might be, for example, the initial

10

hearing, where the judge says:

11

I've got these three groups of consolidated

12

cases, separately consolidated, I also have

13

overriding administrative business to do, and

14

I'm going to do that under (a)(1).

15

to have an omnibus pretrial hearing under

16

(a)(1), I'm going to bring everyone together.

17

I'm not consolidating these three groups, but

18

we're going to talk about how we're going to

19

administer this case.

20

Despite that

I'm going

And -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How is this

21

different from a case in which a plaintiff

22

brings multiple claims, not all of them

23

directly related?

24

there's a partial entry of judgment on one of

25

the claims, you can't appeal.

And in that situation, if

How is this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

7
1

different?

2

MR. SIMPSON:

Are you talking about

3

where the plaintiff has filed separate lawsuits

4

or just one lawsuit -­

5
6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

One lawsuit with

multiple claims.

7

MR. SIMPSON:

Because this -- this is

8

a -- my client's case is one lawsuit with

9

multiple claims that proceed to determination,

10

just as -­

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Your -- your client

12

has not brought a lawsuit with multiple claims.

13

Your client has brought a claim.

14

like a -- one plaintiff has one, two, three

15

claims.

16

by the plaintiff, so it's not the plaintiff

17

picking one claim and -- and leaving out

18

another plaintiff's claim.

19

And it's not

This is a separate claim brought not

This is a lawsuit A against B and then

20

a separate lawsuit on an entirely different

21

subject matter, B against C.

22

MR. SIMPSON:

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So -­

That's -­
-- it doesn't bring

24

up at all the question that Justice Sotomayor

25

just posed.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

8
1

MR. SIMPSON:

That -- that's entirely

2

correct.

And under Rule 14, if C was liable to

3

B for something arising out of the A versus B

4

lawsuit, that could be brought as one lawsuit

5

and -­

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Simpson, I guess I

7

don't understand your answer to Justice

8

Sotomayor or Justice Ginsburg because, although

9

this suit does present this different kind of

10

issue, I took it that your argument would apply

11

just as well to a suit in which somebody has

12

five claims, splits them up into five different

13

lawsuits.

14

treated the same way that one claim with -- one

15

suit with those five claims is.

16

MR. SIMPSON:

And you're saying that should be

I -- I don't think that

17

those -- well, I think if it gets to the point

18

where a final judgment is entered because the

19

case has not been managed from an early point

20

of the case, where in that situation what the

21

courts do is, under Rule 12(b)(6), they -- they

22

say that this -- this -- you have five

23

different lawsuits going on.

24

decided, you're facing res judicata in the

25

other four.

Once one is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

9
1

And what they do is they order the

2

plaintiff to file all of the claims in one

3

case, and then they dismiss the other four.

4

that's how that's handled under the

5

architecture of the rules.

6

come up under Rule 42.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So

That shouldn't even

I -- I guess the -­

8

the bigger point that I'm making is that it

9

seems to me that your argument applies whenever

10

there is consolidation of cases, regardless of

11

exactly how those cases look and what's in

12

them.

13

breadth of your argument?

14

Am I -- am I right about that, the

MR. SIMPSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

I -­

15

that is absolutely correct.

And I point out in

16

the briefs that when you have that kind of a

17

case, what the court of appeals can do is stay

18

them.

19

importantly, the district court should be

20

managing those early on and you should never

21

get to that point.

But I actually believe, more

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you think -­

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I take it -­

24

it's -- it's correct, isn't it, that if you

25

prevail and -- so that you can appeal, you must

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

10
1
2

appeal?
MR. SIMPSON:

Absolutely.

And that's

3

why I say that if -- if that case that Justice

4

Kagan has described gets to that point, then,

5

yes, they must appeal, and then I think the

6

court of appeals has the ability to look at

7

them and say, well, this case should have been

8

brought as one case and I'm going to -- the

9

court can say I will stay that.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah, but, I

11

mean, I -- yes, but I think most people would

12

think that the district court has a greater

13

familiarity with the litigation, particularly

14

since the court of appeals may know nothing

15

about it until you get a notification, and

16

understands how related the two cases are or

17

how not related they are.

18

ability to consolidate ought to continue to -­

19

I mean, to keep the cases together, to the

20

extent appropriate, ought to remain with the

21

district court, rather than suddenly throwing

22

the issue before a court of appeals that is new

23

to the whole litigation.

24
25

MR. SIMPSON:

And maybe the

It -- that -- that's

certainly the argument that has been made by

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

11
1

the amici, but I think if you look at the

2

architecture of the rules, again, Rule 23(f)

3

also deals with an appeal coming up,

4

an interlocutory appeal under the class action

5

statutes, and there the discretion is given

6

completely to the appellate court.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And -­

But what about the

8

district court in a case like this one?

Could

9

the district court say I think that E, your

10

client, loses on her claim, but I'm not going

11

to enter -- I'm going to instruct the clerk not

12

to enter judgment until we resolve the -- what

13

started out as a counterclaim and then became a

14

separate claim?

15

MR. SIMPSON:

I think the court can do

16

that.

I don't think that would be appropriate.

17

I don't think that's what the rules anticipate.

18

If -- and, you know, under Rule 72, if

19

a judgment is entered on the docket, after 150

20

days it's deemed final.

21

-- there's an indication in the rules that we

22

want these cases to move along.

23

So I think there's a

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But as -- as these

24

questions indicate, there's a whole wide range

25

of -- of -- of possibilities here.

And -- and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

12
1

you're saying that the district judge, which,

2

as the Chief Justice pointed out, is really

3

better situated to decide whether the appeal

4

should be held, has -- has very little

5

authority to do that.

6
7

And, furthermore, it seems to me this
is a trap for the unwary.

8
9

MR. SIMPSON:

Well, to address the

first question, I -- I think the district court

10

has great latitude to do this, but it's under

11

the rubric of Rule 13, compulsory

12

counterclaims, Rule 14, third-party practice,

13

Rule 19, joinder of indispensable parties.

14

That's where these -- the Footnote 7

15

cases in Gelboim, the cases that should have

16

been filed as one, that's where that's supposed

17

to happen.

18

Rule 42.

19

That's not where it comes up in

In terms of a trap for the unwary, the

20

double final judgment rule that my friend

21

proposes actually creates the trap for the

22

unwary because you can have situations where a

23

final judgment is not entered after your case

24

is dismissed and a final judgment is entered.

25

You can have a situation where you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

13
1

don't know how the court is going to deem it

2

consolidated because, if I understand their

3

argument, if it's consolidated for trial, they

4

agree that it can be appealed immediately, but

5

if -- a final judgment is entered, but if it's

6

consolidated for this nebulous all purposes, it

7

cannot.

8
9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose these

parties who certainly don't agree on very much

10

did agree that this case could be treated as

11

one for purposes of appeal.

12
13

What would the stipulation say?
words would they use to do that?

14
15

What

MR. SIMPSON:

For the parties to

stipulate that it would be -­

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The parties -- the

17

parties agree that there should be only one

18

appeal.

19

MR. SIMPSON:

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21

possible under your view?

22

what the stipulation would even say.

23

MR. SIMPSON:

I -- I -­
Is it -- is it
And I'm not sure

I think the -- I think

24

the stipulation in that circumstance would be

25

the parties in 1154 who have the final judgment

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

14
1

would stipulate in the court of appeals to a

2

stay and say we agree that this should remain

3

in abeyance until the rest of the case is

4

decided.

5
6

But that allows the party to protect
their right of appeal.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the

8

court of appeals might well have something to

9

say about that.

The courts of appeals don't

10

like to have matters just resting on their

11

docket, depending upon matters of years before

12

the district court might get to the other

13

matter.

14

MR. SIMPSON:

Certainly.

But I think

15

in -- if the parties are coming to the court

16

and explaining why they think it should be

17

stayed, I -- I don't -- the court of appeals

18

might disagree, and, obviously, that's its

19

prerogative.

20

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, counsel, for

21

the -- for the courts of appeals that prefer

22

the practice of deferring everything until

23

there's a final judgment on a final matter in

24

the district court, could they just have a

25

rule, a local rule or practice of deferring

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

15
1

cases along the lines that we've just

2

discussed?

3

MR. SIMPSON:

I -- I think -- I think

4

if -- they could have a rule for cases that

5

should have been filed as one, the Gelboim note

6

7 cases.

7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

No, I'm talking

8

about for cases just like this.

If -- if we're

9

in a circuit that prefers as a matter of

10

practice to wait until everything is done, is

11

there anything inhibiting them from adopting a

12

rule staying cases where there's another

13

related matter still lurking in the district

14

court?

15
16
17

I can't see any.
And it's not -- this is not an

unfriendly question.
MR. SIMPSON:

Understood.

I -- I -- I

18

think the whole purpose, you know, Rule 1 of

19

the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and I

20

think there's an equivalent under the Federal

21

Rules of Appellate Procedure, is that cases are

22

supposed to be administered for the speedy

23

administration of justice, speedy and

24

efficient.

25

And I think a blanket rule like that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

16
1

would run counter to that.

I think if the

2

court exercised its discretion to look at each

3

case and say, well, we think this should be

4

stayed, I think that would pass muster.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. -­

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose you were

7

arguing this point before the civil rules

8

committee, and so the question would be:

9

is the best procedure?

What would your

10

argument be?

11

a better one than the alternative?

12

What

Why is the procedure you outline

MR. SIMPSON:

The why -- the reason

13

it's a better one is because it provides this

14

bright-line rule.

15

you have a final judgment, you know you have to

16

appeal.

17

You cannot be trapped.

When

There's -- as I indicated, there's a

18

problem in the double final judgment rule with

19

not having a second final judgment actually

20

entered.

21

why the case was -- what -- that the court of

22

appeals might disagree with you as to why the

23

court of -­

24
25

There's the problem of not knowing

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, why would there

-- why would the alternative not provide a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

17
1

bright-line rule?

2

that if a case -- if cases are consolidated,

3

they are considered to be one case for purposes

4

of the final judgment rule.

5

So the alternative might be

MR. SIMPSON:

I -- I think -- I think

6

that's counter to a whole -- a lot of history

7

of this Court and counter to the rest of the,

8

as we describe in the briefs, the various

9

problems with merging cases.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could you design a

11

rule, if you were following Justice Alito's

12

question, you're addressing the rules

13

committee, you want to improve the rules, could

14

you design a rule so that the parties or the

15

judge does have an option?

16

MR. SIMPSON:

Absolutely.

It would be

17

Rule 42(a)(4).

18

in cases that should have been brought as one

19

under -- or could have been brought as one

20

under Rules 13 through 24, the district court

21

will have the power to merge them.

22

don't fall within that category, that is the

23

Gelboim Footnote 7 category -­

24
25

And it would be -- provide that

JUSTICE ALITO:
than Rule 54(b)?

But if they

But why is that better

This is what I'm getting at.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

18
1

So you -- I asked you why would your rule be a

2

better rule, and part of your answer was

3

there's a lot of history and authority on the

4

other side.

5

all that.

6

But I'm asking you to disregard

Let's say it's just a policy question.

7

Why is your rule better than a rule that says

8

that when cases are consolidated they are

9

considered to be one case for purposes of the

10

final judgment rule, and the district court, of

11

course, can proceed under Rule 54(b) if it

12

wishes?

13

MR. SIMPSON:

It creates a lot of

14

murky rules.

15

-- a private party plaintiff is suing and the

16

government is suing, and those two cases are

17

consolidated, when -- when does the time for no

18

-- for filing a notice of appeal run, 30 days

19

or 60 days?

20

knows.

21

question as to when that happens.

22

For example, if a plaintiff has

If they're not merged, each party

If they're merged, there's a real

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In this case -- in

23

this case, it was the clerk that entered the

24

final judgment, am I right?

25

one who issued the judgment under 58.

The clerk was the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

19
1

MR. SIMPSON:

Yes.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And doesn't that

3

rule provide that the court could otherwise

4

order if the court didn't want that judgment to

5

be entered?

6

MR. SIMPSON:

Yes.

And -- and not

7

only that, you know, I think there is evidence

8

from -- not only from that, but from the fact

9

that when the motion for attorneys' fees was

10

not filed within 14 days of final judgment, the

11

district judge denied the motion for fees for

12

failure to file it in a timely fashion.

13

that was not a final judgment, they would not

14

have denied the motion.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

16

If

Could you explain a

little bit more how you're reading Rule 58?

17

MR. SIMPSON:

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Sure.
And that was what

19

Justice Ginsburg asked you; is that right, when

20

you said yes, it authorizes the court to do

21

that.

22

What -- how does it do that?
MR. SIMPSON:

It -- it's non-specific.

23

It is -- essentially, it says if -- the -- with

24

-- after entry of a verdict, or -- and two

25

other occasions, the clerk shall enter the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

20
1

judgment, unless the district judge directs

2

otherwise.

3

There's no guidance given to that.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, but, counsel,

5

that's what it says I think in (b)(1) with

6

respect to general verdicts.

7

with respect to special verdicts doesn't

8

contain any parallel language like that and, in

9

fact, suggests that the judgment has to be

10

But then (b)(2)

entered promptly.

11

What do we do about that?

12

MR. SIMPSON:

I -- I -- I think -- I

13

think it does have to be entered promptly.

14

that -- I think that's what happened in this

15

case.

16

-- not under that section.

17

It was entered promptly.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And

Not under 52

But as I understood

18

your answer to Justice Kagan and -- and Justice

19

Ginsburg, it was one of the reasons we don't

20

need to worry about your proposed rule is that

21

the district court has discretion to delay the

22

entry of judgment and that that is textually

23

found in (b)(1), which, indeed, it is with

24

respect to general verdicts, but there's no

25

parallel language that you can rely on with

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

21
1

respect to (b)(2).

2

And does that diminish your argument

3

by suggesting there the district court doesn't

4

have jurisdiction -- discretion to delay the

5

entry of judgment?

6

MR. SIMPSON:

I -- I don't -- I don't

7

think it diminishes the argument at all.

I

8

think -- we are advocating for the entry of

9

judgment.

So whether it's under (b)(1) or

10

(b)(2), I'm not sure that there's a distinction

11

from our point of view.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

May I ask you a

13

different kind of question, Mr. Simpson?

14

just really goes back to the language here.

15

It

I mean, would you agree that your

16

understanding of what it means to consolidate

17

cases is different from the ordinary meaning of

18

that term?

19

MR. SIMPSON:

I think -- I'm not sure

20

what the ordinary meaning of that term is,

21

quite frankly, Your Honor.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, suppose I said

23

to you that a company was going to consolidate

24

two offices.

25

offices or one office?

Are they going to have two

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

22
1

MR. SIMPSON:

Typically, I think

2

people would think they would have one office.

3

So, if you're talking about the -- the typical

4

layman's understanding, yes, I think that means

5

one.

6

But -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

So -- and it's not

7

just laymen, right?

I mean, if you look at

8

Black's Law Dictionary, it says a consolidation

9

in civil procedure, it defines as "the

10

court-ordered unification of two or more

11

actions into a single action."

12
13

So that's the Black's Law Dictionary
definition.

Same thing.

Two becomes one.

14

MR. SIMPSON:

15

think that's what the rules do.

16

think that's -­

17

And I -- I -- I don't

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And I don't

What was -- there

18

was a statute, was there not, before the rules,

19

there was a statute?

20

MR. SIMPSON:

Correct.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the statute

22

used the word "consolidate," didn't it?

I

23

don't have it in front of me.

24

the -- the statute that dealt with this issue

25

before Rule 58.

So I -- but what

MR. SIMPSON:

Again, I'm looking for

the language, but -­

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, it did.

And

7

-- and then, in Johnson, Johnson tells us that

8

"consolidate" for the purpose of that

9

predecessor statute did not mean a complete

10

merger.

11

MR. SIMPSON:

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Correct.
So Johnson is very

13

much on your side.

14

interpreting a statute which, although it

15

similarly used the word "consolidate," was

16

different in other respects.

17

But -- but Johnson was

And I'm wondering whether now that

18

we're on a kind of blank slate, we have a new

19

rule, it's different from the statute in a

20

number of ways, why we have to keep on giving

21

this quite unusual understanding of the word

22

"consolidate," why we have to keep on the same

23

track; why we can't just say, you know what,

24

"consolidate" means consolidate.

25

becomes one.

It means two

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. SIMPSON:

That -- I -- of course,

2

you're -- you are operating on a blank slate

3

and you could do that, but I think when you

4

look at how the courts have interpreted

5

"consolidate," there are many different

6

understandings of the term.

7

And -- and so -- and I think that's

8

what the -- the rules have embodied over the

9

years.

10

So you have -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, there is -- lots

11

of courts say, look, we're going to consolidate

12

for some purposes but not all purposes.

13

when a court does that, of course, it means

14

something else.

15

these two lawsuits are going to come together.

16

And

It means just segments of

But when a court says we're going to

17

consolidate for all purposes, I mean, just the

18

usual understanding of that is, okay, now we

19

have one lawsuit in front of us.

20

would have consequences as to what we think the

21

final judgment is, when it comes, and when your

22

appellate rights would kick in.

23

MR. SIMPSON:

And that

Yes, Your Honor.

But,

24

again, even there the courts are all over the

25

world on that.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Some courts say all purposes has to -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I know.

But where -­

3

we kind of get to figure out what's right and

4

what's wrong as to all these courts that are

5

all confused.

6

That's why we're here.

MR. SIMPSON:

But I would submit then

7

that if -- if that would be the definition,

8

then the cases must truly become one.

9

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But there

could be -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

In which case I have

12

just one question, which is forget the

13

consolidation for a moment, just to clarify in

14

my mind; think of Rule 54(b), imagine it's a

15

case with a lot of parties and a lot of issues,

16

and Rule 54(b), I think, says that "the court

17

can direct entry of a final judgment as to one

18

or more, but fewer than all, the claims or

19

parties," right?

20

MR. SIMPSON:

Yes.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

Now suppose a

22

judge does that as to one of the claims.

23

that moment, the clerk writes a separate piece

24

of paper and it says final judgment as to that

25

claim, right?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

At

26

2

MR. SIMPSON:

I don't -- I don't know

how that -­

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that's

4

important because -- because what I'm going to

5

ask you is -- is -- there is a single piece of

6

paper here, is there not?

7

MR. SIMPSON:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

Yes.
And it says final

judgment, right?

10

MR. SIMPSON:

In this case only, yes.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

So I thought perhaps

12

there is a rule somewhere which says when there

13

is a final judgment on a separate piece of

14

paper, you can take an appeal.

15

such rule that I can find.

But there is no

20

and there is no place where it says you can

21

always appeal from a final judgment, then

22

whether this counts as a decision for purposes

23

of appeal, is it a final decision, is up for

24

grabs.

25

It doesn't say "final

And so, if it says "final decision"

And the policy arguments and the old

Heritage Reporting Corporation

statute and the old case are all relevant.

2

Now, have I got the question right?

3

MR. SIMPSON:

I think so, yes.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

MR. SIMPSON:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

I do?

Yes, I think so.
Okay.

So then we are

7

going to decide -- if we decided against you

8

and said, no, final decision does not always

9

mean final judgment, and, indeed, this is a

10

case for the policy reasons they list, for

11

example, where it doesn't count, okay, and the

12

judge has to -- all right.

work?

14

MR. SIMPSON:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

What havoc would we

A lot of havoc.
Now, I know you think

16

that, but I want to know what.

17

MR. SIMPSON:

Well, for -- for

18

starters, there's -- there's always been the

19

core, going -- going not even back just to the

20

Judiciary Act but back to Blackstone, of the

21

final judgment that -- where the court

22

disassociates itself from the case being an

23

appealable judgment.

24

here.

25

And that's what we have

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so all the time,

JUSTICE BREYER:

be able to find authority where -- that

that authority in your brief?

Because I want

to -- the authority is for the proposition,

forgetting consolidation, that once a piece of

MR. KATYAL:

Now, with -- with respect

to the attorney fees questions, I think my

friend has misstated the way the rules work.

23

So, first of all, the judgment here, the piece

24

of paper, to use Justice Breyer's term, was

25

entered on February 4th of 2015.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

That resolved all claims.

It was at

that moment a final judgment and started three

6

filed actually 20 days later, after the 14-day

10

clock had expired.

11

within the 14 days, it wouldn't have been out

12

of time.

13

here is that the motion came in late.

14

the district court is saying, which is the same

15

thing that courts all over the country say, is:

16

You don't get to start a new attorneys' fees

it's not a final judgment until both -- all

MR. KATYAL:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, Justice Sotomayor -­
-- without a final

judgment?

5

MR. KATYAL:

Justice Sotomayor, our

6

position is it is a final judgment when the

7

piece of paper was entered on February 4th.

8

And what changed it, and this is what Rule 59,

9

the advisory committee notes say, is when you

10

file a Rule 59 motion, it suspends what was

11

otherwise a final judgment.

12

brought his appeal February 5th, absolutely.

There's no problem with that.

15

Yes, we do, Justice

There is a few different points to

mandated to have two pieces of paper, even when

you have all-purposes consolidation.

19

The Gonzalez case in the Northern

Lots of cases say

But to go back to Justice Breyer's

20

question, there is no case, zero case that says

21

that when you file two pieces of paper, that

22

that somehow changes things.

23

Rather, the Court has always looked to

24

the underlying substance.

Is this two becoming

25

one or is it two separate claims?

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Why

So -­
Now, that's where I

get stuck.
If we have a district court that

22

issues separate judgments, I think pretty much

23

any cautious litigator would take that

24

seriously and file a notice of appeal because

25

it's a signal from the district court that it

2

decision in this matter.

3

It is finished.

MR. KATYAL:

There is a final

So, Justice Gorsuch,

4

first, let's start with what the district court

5

did.

It's found at the petition appendix, page

6

815.

This is the consolidation order.

7

says:

8

granted.

"First, the motion to consolidate is

9

Second" -­
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

10

it's ambiguous.

11

merged.

I've read it and

It doesn't say they are

It doesn't use that word.

12

MR. KATYAL:

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

14

And it

Well -­
It doesn't say for

all purposes.

15

And then we have, as the Chief Justice

16

points out, a later order from the same

17

district court, which I assume we would take as

18

seriously as a consolidation order, it being a

19

final judgment and all.

20

that.

21

MR. KATYAL:

So help me out with

Yes.

If I could, first

22

I'd like to -- just to use the language of the

23

plain text of this order -- of what the order

24

is.

25

So Number 2 is the following cases,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

38
1

plural, shall be consolidated, Number 1154 and

2

then 1395.

3

And then the third piece is:

"All

4

submissions in the consolidated case shall be

5

filed in Case Number 354."

6

plural, cases, become one, kind of like

7

piece of paper saying a final judgment, bong,

2

appeal.

3

Now, sometimes they also have to know

4

that if someone has moved for a new trial and

5

it's granted, then, of course, there's no

6

longer a final judgment.

7

true in Rule 59 or 50, what was it, 50,

8

wherever it was, 54, in respect to a new trial

9

for some of the other parties.

10

MR. KATYAL:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

But that wouldn't be

So -­
That wouldn't affect

12

the judgment on -- that says final judgment as

13

to Smith when Jones gets a new trial on other

14

issues.

15
16

And so why wouldn't the lawyer think
exactly the same here?

17

MR. KATYAL:

So -­

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's the same

19

process.

It's the same thing.

It is totally

20

consolidated, perhaps no more and no less than

21

an ordinary case with thousands of parties and

22

thousands of issues.

23

MR. KATYAL:

So -- so, Justice Breyer,

24

I'll answer your question and then, if I could,

25

I'd like to return to Justice Gorsuch's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

40
1

question.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MR. KATYAL:

Yeah.

So the answer to your

4

question is the part of Rule 54 which nobody

5

has read yet.

6

to the appendix, page 3A reproduces 54.

7

I'll just read a part of it to you:

8

action presents more than one claim for relief

9

-- whether there's a claim, counterclaim,

And if you -- turn our red brief
And

"When an

10

crossclaim, or third-party claim -- or when

11

multiple parties are involved, the court may

12

direct entry of a final judgment as to one or

13

more, but fewer than all."

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MR. KATYAL:

Right.

Now, here is the

16

important language, a sentence down:

17

"Otherwise, any order or other decision,

18

however designated, that adjudicates fewer than

19

all the claims or rights and liabilities of

20

fewer than all the parties does not end the

21

action."

22

So the Rule 54, Justice Breyer,

23

answers the question by saying, look, if you

24

have a consolidated case, and then not all the

25

claims or counterclaims of all of the rights

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

41
1

and parties are adjudicated, then you're on

2

notice that your case is not yet final.

3

And that's what we're asking you to

4

do, which is the rule, as our red brief at page

5

14 points out, in every single circuit, with

6

the partial exception of the Sixth Circuit,

7

which has introduced contrary things.

8

wants to switch up the rule massively.

9

And he

Now, Justice Gorsuch, you asked what

10

about this order, doesn't it suggest maybe that

11

it wasn't all-purpose consolidation?

12

I said, the Third Circuit as the case comes to

13

the court, this is found at petition appendix,

14

page 4, says this was all-purpose

15

consolidation.

16

asked this and said, hey, it doesn't use the

17

word all purpose, but the court relying on the

18

Third Circuit precedent, which is Bergstrom,

19

said if a decision -- and this is the law in

20

many, many circuits -- if a decision doesn't

21

say all-purpose consolidation or not, but

22

everything is merged together, it is treated as

23

all-purpose consolidation.

As -- as

At the oral argument, they even

24

And that follows from -­

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Katyal, I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

42
1

-- one thing that concerns me.

This is, for

2

all the back and forth, a relatively simple

3

case.

4

lawyers, same parties, but consolidation can

5

come up in a situation and often does when

6

there are 100 separate cases, a mass tort

7

situation.

We're talking about two cases, same

8

And there, one waiting for the final

9

judgment can be a very long wait and it could

10

be very prejudicial.

11

some sort of mass tort and some of the people

12

have, you know, emotional distress damages,

13

others physical injury, and early on the judge

14

says, look, I don't think you can recover

15

emotional distress.

16

have emotional distress, judgment is entered

17

against them.

18

I mean, let's say it's in

So all the cases that just

Now let's go on to the other thing

19

which is going to take five years.

20

your position make that extremely complicated?

21

MR. KATYAL:

Doesn't

No, Mr. Chief Justice.

22

think that this is -- this is really a bad

23

solution of my friend in search of a problem.

24

There is no problem.

25

complicated cases, there are three different

That is, in those

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I

Official

independent safety valves.

2

And as this Court in Mohawk said, they

3

go a long way toward resolving this in, for

4

example, the multiple claim case.

5

So there is Rule 54.

The district

6

court can -- can send a case up to the court of

7

appeals.

8

appeal.

9

And together I think those do a good job -­

10

There's 1292(b), an interlocutory
And there is the writ of mandamus.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But why wouldn't

11

the district court think:

What's the point in

12

my entering a 54(b) rule?

I have a case in

13

which a final judgment is entered.

14

that piece of paper that says final judgment

15

under Rule 58 the equivalent of 54(b)?

16

the judges say you want me to order a 54(b)

17

judgment, but there's already a final judgment

18

in this case.

19

didn't tell him otherwise.

20

The clerk entered it.

Why isn't

MR. KATYAL:

I mean,

And I

So just let me say,

21

Justice Ginsburg, I'm not aware of any case in

22

the entire federal system that says because I

23

entered a piece of paper with the -- that uses

24

the words final judgment, that that alone is

25

enough.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

44
1

And to the contrary, and this goes

2

back to Justice Breyer's question, Mackey and

3

Cold Metal Process are both cases in which

4

there was the designation of a final judgment.

5

But that wasn't enough because, if you resolve

6

only some of the claims or you resolve claims

7

only against some of the defendants, that's not

8

enough.

9

it sua sponte.

10

You've got to ask for the 54 or have

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can you explain to

11

me, you did say in your brief that there is -­

12

that a common issue is central to the

resolution of these two cases.

That's the charge of the

those cases?

I want to break apart a chunk of the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

relates to the question that the Chief asked,

judge orders a new trial of the other case.

3

How much time has elapsed from the time she

4

lost her case with a paper saying final

5

judgment and when the son's case against the

6

daughter is finally resolved?

7

MR. KATYAL:

8

Right.

So the -- there

is a large gap of time, as there often is in -­

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

MR. KATYAL:

How much time?

Well, I think at about

11

approximately two years.

And that's true

exactly what the Third Circuit said:

Once you see

but forget that for a second -- for all

3

relevant purposes, you have what the rules call

a case with multiple claims involving multiple

5

parties, both.

6

And, therefore, what you do, lawyer,

7

is if you want a quick appeal, you tell the

8

judge to make an express finding that there is

9

no just reason for delay.

Judge, you must make

10

that finding or you cannot enter a final

So you want the consolidation -- it

would be nice if it explicitly, but you want us

to say it implicitly references 54(b) and

17

that's how we should handle it; is that right

18

or wrong?

19

MR. KATYAL:

That is right.

And that

20

is exactly what every circuit does -- this is

21

our red brief at page 14 -- with the partial

22

exception of the Sixth.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, in Johnson -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Katyal -­

25

MR. KATYAL:

We're asking -­

-- that you keep the same

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

49

2

rule in place.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Mr. Katyal, in

3

Johnson, the Court -- before Rule 42 was

4

adopted, the Court said consolidation is

5

permitted as a matter of convenience and

6

economy and administration but does not merge

7

the suits into a single cause or change the

8

rights of the parties.

9

Now, if -- and -- and there's the old

10

rule that the plaintiff is the master of the

11

complaint that the plaintiff files.

12

intent of Rule 42 was to change that, wouldn't

13

the -- wouldn't the -- the rule drafters have

14

done so clearly?

15

"consolidation" doesn't -- is certainly not a

16

clear signal that Johnson's understanding of

17

consolidation is no longer the one that's

18

embodied in the rule.

19

So, if the

But just to use the term

MR. KATYAL:

So, Justice Alito, we

20

quite agree that plaintiffs are in general the

21

masters of their complaint, but they're not

22

masters of the timing of their appeal.

23

the whole purpose of the final judgment rule,

24

to empower district courts really to make the

25

determination.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

That is

Official

50
1

Johnson was a partial consolidation

2

case.

It was not a full purpose consolidation

3

case.

And here's what the advisory committee

4

notes in 1937 said about this.

5

Section 734, which was the statute being

6

interpreted in Johnson, but is -- insofar as

7

the statute differs from the rule, it is

8

modified.

9

They said:

And so you do have the advisory

10

committee saying so.

11

points out, that is the definition -­

12

And as Justice Kagan

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The advisory

13

committee did not say -- it said insofar as; it

14

didn't say that your position is the correct

15

one.

16

Suppose -- could you not, instead of

17

just -- there was -- the court granted a new

18

trial in your client's case against the

19

daughter.

20

court at that point to stay the entry of

21

judgment on the estate's claim, couldn't you?

22

You could have asked the district

MR. KATYAL:

Well, I -- I think we

23

might be able to, but as Justice Gorsuch was

24

pointing out, that delay of the entry of the

25

judgment when you have a special verdict

form -­

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

3

MR. KATYAL:

4

But you had -­

-- has to occur within

150 days.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You had a certain

6

advantage by not doing that, by not asking to

7

stay the entry of the judgment on the estate's

8

claim, because then you and your law firm have

9

no claim outstanding against you that has to be

10

shown on financial statements.

11

MR. KATYAL:

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So -­
So by having the

13

separate judgment final, you don't have to

14

report it -­

15

MR. KATYAL:

So -­

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- but if you're

17

right that it really isn't a final judgment,

18

then as the -- Sam and his law firm, had they

19

listed this as a claim still outstanding

20

against them -­

21

MR. KATYAL:

So, Justice Ginsburg, we

22

agree with you that sometimes, if you adopt our

23

rule, it's going to benefit one side or the

24

other.

25

the same point that this Court made in Mohawk,

I think the point we're making here is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. KATYAL:

think that, as the Third Circuit said, yes,

8

there's so much overlap between these two that

there can be -­

MR. KATYAL:

And the federal rules

In fact, even this

So it seems to me that your dependence

8

on 54 runs into a bit of a plain language

9

issue.

10

MR. KATYAL:

I don't think so.

I

11

think that this Court has always said that Rule

12

54 should be interpreted practically, not

13

technically.

14

meaning that goes all the way back to Mackey

15

and Cold Metal.

16

It does have a kind of unique

And the question is -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Do you have any -­

17

do you have any answer on the text of action,

18

though?

19

MR. KATYAL:

Well, I think that the

20

text of action is -- refers -- means a single

21

judicial unit, and the -- and the rules empower

22

a court to -- a district court to decide what

23

is a single judicial unit.

24
25

So this is why every circuit,
basically, with the exception of the Sixth,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

55

says it is -- an action for purposes of Rule 54

2

is a all-purpose consolidated set of cases

Two becomes one.

That is an

5

Now, there are times when the rules

6

use different words -- use the same words to

7

have different meanings in it.

8

fees, for example, are considered costs under

9

Rule 68 but not 41.

10

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So attorneys'

Do you know anywhere

11

else in -- in the rules where "action" is used

12

differently?

13

MR. KATYAL:

Well, I think actually -­

14

you know, I don't -- I'm not sure that you -­

15

you should get into that for purposes here and

16

-- and write an opinion that says action for

17

all purposes in other rules, but -­

18

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

No, I'm -- I'm just

19

asking whether you're familiar with any other

20

place in the rules.

21

MR. KATYAL:

Well, I -- I don't know

22

that it comes up really in -- in any other

23

rules.

24

that this is going to have some domino effect

25

on other rules, we don't think is true.

Our red brief explains the kind of idea

Heritage Reporting Corporation

56
1

To the extent it'll matter, it might

2

matter in, you know, a couple of rules.

3

if anything, as Professor Steadman's article

4

shows, you know, that might promote more

5

efficiency.

6

into it.

7

But,

But we think you shouldn't get

There's a long tradition of the Court

8

adopting different meanings of words in the

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, costs, you

10

know, costs and, you know, other -- other words

11

like that.

12

So I don't think you should get -- I

don't think you should do more.

Now, if -- our

central point to you, and this is made by the

15

district judges' amicus brief, is that the

24

really does lead you to think about the term

25

consolidation differently.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. KATYAL:

Right.

Right.

So I

2

don't believe the prior statute did break apart

3

these two.

4

to the plain text of (a)(2), I do think it does

5

say something different.

6

And so I do think that, to go back

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could you also add

7

42(a)(3)?

8

joint hearings and trials.

9
10

Because 42(a)(1) is about, you know,

MR. KATYAL:

Exactly.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

42(a)(3) says, look,

11

you can also issue any other kind of order you

12

want to minimize delay.

13

from that, you have this consolidation

14

provision.

15

MR. KATYAL:

And then, separate

Exactly, Justice Kagan.

16

And so, look, I could imagine that you could

17

twist the rule and mean it to -- to be

18

something else and try and get it out of

19

Johnson, but, boy, before you did so and go

20

against the plain text, I think you'd have to

21

have a incredibly good reason to depart from

22

the long-standing idea that federal district

23

courts are best empowered, as the amicus brief

24

by federal judges says, to make these

25

determinations, to send up those cases.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You -- you've

2

mentioned that a couple times.

What -- what

3

are we to make of the amicus brief by -- filed

4

by seven retired federal judges?

5

that the other 280 don't agree with it or -- or

6

--

7

(Laughter.)

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9
10

Do we imply

I -- I don't

quite know what to -- what to do with that.
MR. KATYAL:

Right.

I mean, I think,

11

you know, you have -- you have a similar group

12

before you in Gelboim, and I do think that, you

13

know, look, we -- if we had more time, we -- I

14

suppose we would have gotten more judges, but

15

we did want to bring to you the perspective, I

16

think the judges want to bring to you the

17

perspective of, you know, having sit through

18

these long, complicated trials -­

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it's the

20

perspective of seven individuals.

21

that that represents the perspective of

22

district judges generally.

23

MR. KATYAL:

Right.

I don't know

It's -- it's just

24

one data point, but I do think it's a data

25

point that squares very much with what this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

60
1

Court has said time and again in Cold Metal, in

2

Mackey, in, you know, Richardson, that district

3

courts in complex cases, to use what you were

4

saying earlier, Mr. Chief Justice, are

5

particularly suited to trying to decide whether

6

or not cases are going to be interrelated.

7

And to allow piecemeal appeals, by -­

8

you know, without the permission of the

9

district court is really to do something very

10
11

dangerous to the -- to the circuits.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Katyal, what

12

do you think we should do if, on the one hand,

13

we think your rule makes a lot of sense for

14

cases that are consolidated completely for all

15

purposes, but, on the other hand, we're

16

concerned that this case should not have been?

17

What should we do with that?

18

MR. KATYAL:

Well, I don't think, you

19

know, that it's way too late to say this case

20

shouldn't have been consolidated.

21

that's just, I think, waived in multiple

22

different ways, but -­

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean,

It just does seem to

24

me that many of the questions that have been

25

put to you really do deal with the question of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

61
1

whether consolidation was proper here.

2

MR. KATYAL:

Right.

Exactly.

And as

3

our brief at page 43 explains, look, you can

4

appeal a consolidation order.

You can even do

5

it on an interlocutory basis.

There are cases

6

that permit that.

7

proper cause of action.

8
9

That would have been the

But to fight, and this is my opening
lines to you today, to fight about that, you

10

know, through the guise of trying to say, well,

11

I get to file a right of appeal, he's

12

complaining about consolidation.

13

complain about consolidation, you know, he

14

should have complained about it and other

15

litigants can in other cases, but don't try and

16

twist Rule 54 and Rule 42 to try and

17

accommodate that.

Let him

18

That's a very separate thing.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, would you -­

20

you're making it two cases, in fact, your

21

client did, because originally that claim was

22

brought as a counterclaim, part of one action

23

and a counterclaim.

24

the counterclaim and commenced an independent

25

action.

You deliberately dropped

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

62
1

MR. KATYAL:

So, Justice Ginsburg,

2

that's exactly what's going on in Cold Metal.

3

There are two very different -- there are two

4

different causes of action.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You made it -- your

6

client has made it from a case with a claim and

7

a counterclaim into two cases.

8

MR. KATYAL:

9

Right.

And that's an

argument he could have used to try and oppose

10

consolidation.

11

comes to the Court, I don't think that would be

12

appropriate.

13

But at this point, as this case

Now, to the extent we're worried about

14

abuse about consolidation or something like

15

that, I think Justice Alito's idea of the

16

national federal rules committee is one to

17

think about this, but I don't think it would be

18

a good idea to use local rules and have

19

geographic variations circuit to circuit and

20

people having to wonder whether or not they

21

have to file notices of appeal and, you know,

22

whether there would be a right -­

23

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Wouldn't it be

24

clearer if it were in the rules rather than in

25

the case law which is currently so split?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. KATYAL:
actually split.

3

Well, I don't think it's

I mean, if you go back -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, the reason

4

that we took this case is because there is a

5

split.

6

MR. KATYAL:

Well, only with a partial

7

exception of the Sixth Circuit.

Our brief goes

8

through all of these cases.

9

When you deal with

10

partial consolidation in general.

11

three cases we have been able to find in the

that disagree with what every other circuit

14

that we have been able to find that's ruled on

So I think all we're saying to you is

17

leave the rules where they are.

To the extent

18

you're concerned about any, you know, problems

19

with the rules, any problems with

20

consolidation, I think the national rules

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW C. SIMPSON

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

MR. SIMPSON:

The -- the

4

characterization of this consolidation changed

5

in the -- from the opposition to the writ for

6

certiorari to the red brief.

7

At the red brief, at the certiorari

8

stage, it was characterized as we did as a

9

consolidation for trial.

10

And that's what it was.

I think it's

11

important to understand that all the circuits

12

disagree about even what is consolidation for

13

all purposes.

14

The Bogosian case from the Third

15

Circuit says a case consolidated for pretrial

16

and trial purposes is for all purposes.

17

That's what happened in our case.

It

18

was consolidated for pretrial and trial.

19

so, under the Third Circuit definition, it is

20

all purposes.

21

And

Other circuits have a completely

22

different definition and they talk about, in

23

the unitary consolidation type of case, there's

24

one docket, there's one judgment entered, not

25

two.

They call that all-purpose consolidation.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

65

So that's one of the problems we have

2

here.

3

noted, refers to a single action.

4

nothing in the amendments to the -- or the

5

adoption of the federal rules to suggest that

6

the rules committee was planning on overruling

7

a Supreme Court precedent from the year before

8

that said cases don't merge.

9

appear in the federal rules.

10

The Rule 54, Justice Gorsuch, as you

13

it is not two years.

14

February will make three years since the entry

15

of the final judgment in my client's case, and

16

the other case still is not final.

17

We are now three years -­

The new trial has already been held.

18

No judgment has been entered on it.

19

The verdict then came in.

The -- the verdict -­

16

MR. SIMPSON:

17

Elsa in her individual capacity.

18

just one quick clarification on this case.

19

And one -­

There are two different Elsas in this

20

case.

They are not the same parties.

Elsa in

21

her individual capacity is legally distinct

22

from Elsa as the trustee of the trust.

23

that's the Alexander v. Todman case.

And the

24

Third Circuit makes that very clear.

So this

25

is not A versus B and B versus A where B could
