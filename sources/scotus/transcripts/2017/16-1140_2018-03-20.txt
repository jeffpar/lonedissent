ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL P. FARRIS

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11

MR. FARRIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

12

California took aim at pro-life

13

pregnancy centers by compelling licensed

14

centers to point the way to an abortion and

15

imposing onerous advertising rules on

16

unlicensed centers that do not provide

17

ultrasounds or any other medical services.

18

The state then provided exemptions for

19

all other medical providers who serve pregnant

20

women.

facilities they might contact, or provide

7

instruction on how to care for infants?

MR. FARRIS:

Court decided a very similar case in the Casey

12

decision from Pennsylvania.

14

informed consent discussion.

15

is triggered by a doctor proposing to perform a

16

particular medical intervention.

Informed consent

Medical interventions are surgeries.

case.

3

MR. FARRIS:

I understand, Your Honor.

4

If the state anchors that in the informed

5

consent framework, then it would be considered

6

under the -- the Casey legal principles,

7

because, in Casey, this Court recognized that

8

--

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It doesn't anchor

10

it under any -- it's just -- that's what the

11

law is, what it says.

12

provider, you have to tell patients that if

13

they want to carry the pregnancy to term, they

14

can have assistance, call this number.

15

MR. FARRIS:

If you are an abortion

Your Honor, yes.

That is

16

in the context of proposing a medical

17

intervention, describing the alternatives.

18

This Court in Harris versus McRae and in Casey

19

indicated that the state has an additional

20

interest beyond the health of the woman in the

21

interest of advancing the life of the unborn

22

child, to a degree.

23

It can't go too far.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But you're -- but

24

you're saying that if there is a non-medical

25

facility -- I mean, I don't want to put words

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
8
1

in your mouth.

This is a question.

If there

2

is a non-medical facility that the state has

3

reason to think is -- is a -- is telling women

4

about only one set of options and not another

5

set of options, but here, the case would be

6

they're only telling women about abortion

7

providers, and they're not telling women about

8

other ways that they may be able to complete

9

their pregnancy, that the state could not

10

impose a requirement that that facility post a

11

notice saying, in fact, there are many kinds of

12

facilities in the world and some are abortion

13

providers and some are crisis pregnancy centers

14

and some are something else, that -- that that

15

would not be permissible?

16

MR. FARRIS:

Your Honor, that would be

17

decide -- since it's in an unlicensed facility

18

that the requirement is being framed up, that

19

would be judged under strict judicial scrutiny,

20

and I don't believe it would be required.

21

If in the license context, however, it

22

would still be the same framework, but the

23

analysis would be slightly different because

24

it's -- here, in this case, it's being -­

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess I'm not sure,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
9
1

licensed, unlicensed.

You -- you were

2

suggesting that everything turned on whether a

3

medical procedure was going to be performed.

4

And my hypothetical was designed to take out

5

the medical procedure; in other words, this is

6

a facility that just refers women, but it

7

refers women only to abortion providers.

8

And the state decides we don't want

9

facilities that refer women only to abortion

10

providers.

11

women about the full range of their options.

12

We want facilities that will tell

And so the question is:

Would a -- a

13

requirement that such a facility post a notice

14

saying there actually are a lot of options and

15

here's how you can access them, would that be

16

unconstitutional?

17

MR. FARRIS:

Yes, Your Honor, because,

18

under your hypothetical, it's a targeted law.

19

It's aimed at particular people, and not given

20

to all doctors who diagnose and confirm

21

pregnancies.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what if it

23

wasn't targeted?

What if there were a state

24

law that required every doctor or facility that

25

provides medical treatment for pregnant women

2

options available to those women and where they

3

might obtain services at no cost, if those -­

4

if -- if those are available?

5
6
7

Would there be anything wrong with a
law like that?
MR. FARRIS:

Well, Your Honor, if it's

8

done in a manner similar to what's being done

9

here in California, to require pro-life

10

doctors, whether in a clinic or otherwise, to

11

point the way to an abortion facility and to

12

facilitate abortion would be constitutionally

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if it did that to

15

-- what if this notice provided for -- set out

16

all of the options and it applied to everybody,

17

so it would apply to pro-life facilities, but

18

it would also apply to clinics that perform

19

abortions?

simply a line of demarcation about your

position on abortion, that would be

unconstitutional in any state.

laws that have been upheld are doctors who are

MR. FARRIS:

Yes, Your Honor.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay, I got it.

My

6

other question, and it's the only other one I

7

have, is you have a totally different line in

8

which you are attacking this, and that is, you

9

say, which is certainly a point, that this

10

statute picks out 60 to 70 really pro-life

11

facilities and says you have to post these

12

signs, but nobody else does.

13

that basic -­

Honor.

And -- and can we decide that without
knowing the evidence?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

MR. FARRIS:

Well, Your Honor, the -­

2

the gerrymandering of the statute is evidence

3

from the face of the statute.

4

statute works is that it begins by only

5

regulating clinics that are licensed under

6

Section 1204 of the California code.

7

The way the

That is limited principally to

8

nonprofit community clinics.

So all doctors in

9

private practice are out of the statute to

10

begin with, and the state admits this in its

11

brief.

12

Additionally, among those nonprofit

13

clinics, the clinics that are in general

14

practice are exempted out even though they

15

serve pregnant women.

16

Then you take the class -- the last

17

gerrymandering in this statute is, among those

18

that are principally giving pregnancy services,

19

if you're willing to sign up for the state's

20

Family PACT program, which requires you to

21

dispense abortifacient drugs, then you're out

22

of the program as well.

23

So through a clever series of

24

legislative gerrymandering, the state has ended

25

up with a result that only nonprofit pro-life

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

pregnancy centers are required to post the

2

notice.

And the notice itself is biased.

3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, along those

4

lines, one other question occurs to me that's

5

similar to Justice Breyer's with respect to the

6

adequacy of the record we have for unlicensed

7

clinics.

13

14

But what -- what do we do about the

15

lack of a record here and whether we should

16

wait for an as-applied challenge -­

17

MR. FARRIS:

18

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

19

Your Honor -­
-- as the government

suggests?

20

MR. FARRIS:

-- Your Honor, this Court

21

faced a similar situation in the Ibanez case

22

where there was a detailed disclosure required

23

in a certain financial profession.

24
25

And this Court didn't have a financial
record.

It didn't have a financial record in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

the Miami Herald case either, in which it

2

simply read the statute and made comments on

3

its inferences.

4

In the advertising context, the rule

5

is the font must be larger than the main body

6

of the ad or the same size as the main body of

7

the ad with special fonts and colors.

MR. FARRIS:

Again, if -- if all doctors

in California who treat pregnant women are

10

under the same requirements, but when there's

11

special imposition upon a targeted group of

people because they don't like their position

question based on that.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So let me ask you,

10

how's that different from what a doctor does?

11

When you go in for a pregnancy, you see the

12

doctor, and the doctor will describe,

13

hopefully, the benefits of a pregnancy and

14

perhaps its risk because, depending -- not all

15

pregnancies are without complications.

16

So this is consulting about a medical

17

condition.

How is that any different than

18

Casey?

19

about abortion.

20

tell the person the alternatives.

You come in to talk to an -- a doctor

21

MR. FARRIS:

Your Honor -­

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, if you're

23

going to choose to talk to people about -- if

24

you're an unlicensed facility, about pregnancy,

25

why shouldn't you tell people that you're not a

doctor?

2

MR. FARRIS:

Well, Your Honor, in -­

in Casey, again, the -- the doctors that were

being regulated were the ones that were

performing abortion.

6

7

it was parallel to the general practice of

8

informed consent.

The Court made note in

11

12

13

They talk about the issue of

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So is it okay for

14

-- is it wrong for a state to tell agencies who

15

give advice on immigration rights -- there's a

16

couple of states like this -- who say, if

17

you're going to give advice on immigration

18

matters, you better tell people you're not a

19

lawyer.

Those are unconstitutional?

20

MR. FARRIS:

No, Your Honor.

That New

21

York statute that does that gives those

22

immigration people who are required to give the

23

notice the ability to intervene in cases and

24

matters.

25

That would otherwise be the practice

Heritage Reporting Corporation

of law.

And so what that amounts to is similar

2

to a statute referred to by the state in its

3

brief where naturopaths and other alternative

4

providers, who are clearly otherwise engaged in

5

The First Amendment allows states to

Now you, the government, and -- and

there.

the only distinction I hear so far is one has a

doctor about to perform and the other has just

Is there any other distinction

MR. WALL:

Justice Breyer, that is the

10

crucial distinction.

11

sauce is for the goose and the gander.

12

when you are performing a medical procedure and

13

you're making disclosures about your own

14

services, what the plurality opinion in Casey

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. WALL:

12

to the service that you're providing.

disclose, and Casey drew that pretty broadly to

say at page 83 -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MR. WALL:

But -- but, Mr. Wall,

I'm sorry.
You've got to make an

informed choice.

And all the government is

20

saying -- we're not saying not goose for the

21

gander; we agree.

22

more you get away from that kind of a

23

disclosure that's about what you're doing with

that patient or customer or client, the more

25

scrutiny it ought to get under the First

What we're saying is the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I think the

3

question is why shouldn't there -- a state

4

says, you know what, this is the regime we

5

want.

6

clinics that they should put up a poster saying

7

we do family planning; we do not do adoption.

We want to say to family planning

8
9

And we want to say to crisis pregnancy
centers, along the lines of Petitioners here,

10

we do adoption; we do not do family planning or

11

abortion.

12

And -- and -- and -- and -- and the

13

state thinks that would be a good system

14

because, when a woman goes in to either one of

15

these kinds of places, they'll know what's

16

there and they'll know what's not there.

17
18
19

And what -- why would that be
problematic?
MR. WALL:

Well, I think because, once

20

it's no longer tied to the specific goods or

21

services that the -- the clinic or center or

22

whomever is -- is providing, then the more we

23

ought to be worried that they're making you

24

just advertise what other people are doing.

25

And this case is even one step beyond

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
32

your hypothetical because it's not even saying

to the clinics, say what you do and don't do.

3

It's saying, look, we want people to know about

Now I think your distinction, and you

15

what an ultrasound is if not a procedure.

services, but in Casey, we permitted it.

4

So please explain to me again why
there's a difference here.

5

MR. WALL:

So, Justice Sotomayor, I

6

agree with everything you said in the back half

7

there.

8

saying, before you, licensed clinic, perform an

9

ultrasound, you've got to provide certain

And if California were coming in and

10

information to make sure that's an informed

11

choice by that woman to get the ultrasound in

12

the face of risks and alternatives, then it's

13

like Casey, and the question is just how much

14

disclosure do you have to provide.

15

I think, gives us important guidance on that.

16

And Casey,

California's notice isn't doing that,

17

at least on the licensed side.

On the licensed

18

side, it's not helping the women who come into

the clinic make an informed choice to opt into

your brief that -- that troubles me, and that

is the government's request that we recognize a

new category of speech called professional

15

speech, which is subject to a -- a lesser

16

standard of review.

17

I mean, this case is very important in

18

itself, but adopting this new category of

19

speech would have far-reaching consequences.

20

And I -- I -- I'd like you to explain why that

21

is consistent with Stevens and other cases

22

where the Court has recently said we are not

23

going to recognize any new categories of

24

unprotected speech and how you would define the

25

boundaries of professional speech.

And what we've tried to say is,

10

whether it's Zauderer or some equivalent for

11

professional speech, if it's a disclosure about

12

what you're doing, we should think that's a

13

fairly low level of scrutiny.

14

that we shift away from that, even in the

15

commercial and professional speech box, we may

16

not get to strict scrutiny, but it is

17

heightened scrutiny and the states' license

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA A. KLEIN

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

9

MR. KLEIN:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The interests served by the licensed

12

disclosure is very much like that of the

13

disclosure in Casey, promoting informed choice

14

by a patient.

15

More specifically, it allows -- it

16

empowers the woman by explaining that her

17

financial circumstance does not make her unable

18

to access alternative and supplemental care,

19

including full prenatal and delivery care that

20

Petitioners do not themselves supply.

21

And it gives her that knowledge in

22

time to be useful, because pregnancy and

23

medical care is extraordinarily time-critical.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

There is a -- a sense

when you read this statute, Mr. Klein, there's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
38
1

at least a question that arises as to whether

2

this statute has been gerrymandered.

3

So would you speak to that?

Because

4

if it has been gerrymandered, that's a serious

5

issue.

6

like, look, we have these general disclosure

7

requirements, but we don't really want to apply

8

them generally, we just want to apply them to

9

some speakers whose speech we don't much like.

10

In other words, if, you know, it's

MR. KLEIN:

Your Honor, the disclosure

11

is targeted at women who seek free care for

12

pregnancy, not at any particular viewpoint.

13

And clinics that, by their very

14

licensing status, provide free or sliding scale

15

low-cost pregnancy care are the ones where

16

those women are going to be found and where

17

this information is immediately useful to them.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

If you have a law

19

that's -- that's neutral on its face, but then

20

it has a lot of crazy exemptions, and when you

21

apply all the exemptions, what you're left with

22

is a very strange pattern and, gee, it turns

23

out that just about the only clinics that are

24

covered by this are pro-life clinics.

25

Do you think it's possible to infer

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
39
1

intentional discrimination in that situation?

2
3

MR. KLEIN:

Yes.

That kind of

hypothetical can support -­

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

So let me ask

5

you about these -- some of these exemptions

6

which I think are hard to understand.

7

this apply only to clinics whose primary

8

function is providing service to pregnant

9

women?

Why does

You could have a small clinic, let's

10

say it's -- it has 30 pregnant women come in a

11

month, but that's the primary thing it does.

12

Then you could have a big clinic that

13

has 100 pregnant women come in a month, but it

14

does so many other things that pregnancy is not

15

the primary concern.

16

does the law apply to one and not the other?

17

MR. KLEIN:

Why -- why would -- why

Well, Your Honor, that

18

serves the purpose of having the disclosure

19

mostly made in the context in which it's useful

20

as opposed to being made in a lot of contexts

21

where it's not.

22

And this Court has said that

23

speech requirements more narrowly when they can

6

there are examples of poor women who stumble

into a for-profit facility?

11

Why are most for-profits exempted?

12

MR. KLEIN:

Your Honor, as a category,

13

for-profit clinics do not seem to treat

14

primarily women who need free and sliding-cost

15

scale -- sliding-cost care in the same way.

16

Now I will say it's always possible to

17

So what is your

What's the percentage?

MR. KLEIN:

Your Honor, the state does

5

not have firm numbers on this.

We have done a

6

preliminary assessment which found a

7

significant number of non-anti-abortion-covered

8

facilities.

9

However, I will also say that deriving

10

this from purely state databases is very tricky

11

because they rely on self-reporting that's hard

12

to interpret as to who really does primarily

13

pregnancy care.

14

--

It's exactly the kind of thing

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

16

MR. KLEIN:

17
18

Well, could you say -­

-- where a record would be

useful.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could you say a few

19

words about how these boundaries came about?

20

In other words, you have these various lines

21

that the statute draws and then it has these

22

exemptions.

23

And what was the state thinking -- I

24

mean, you know, and I realize that the state -­

25

you know, there are lots of people who were

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
43
1

thinking different things, but is there a -­

2

give me a little bit more about your theory of

3

the case even as to why these exemptions exist

4

and why these lines are drawn.

5

You've been saying, well, we go where

6

the problem is.

7

the problem was.

8

thought the problem actually was.

9

you doing?

10

But tell me how you knew where
Tell me how -- what you
What were

What were you trying to do?

MR. KLEIN:

Well, let me start with

11

the question of what the problem is.

And the

12

problem is that the state has overseen, and the

13

state legislature has overseen, an expansion of

14

public medical care in California, but has

15

experienced that publicity campaigns invariably

16

leave a gap that was highly concerning to them

17

in the pregnancy context because of the medical

18

issues and because of the severe timing

19

constraints to get care that makes a

20

difference.

21

And so the -- the goal of the statute

22

is to identify women who are seeking pregnancy

23

care and appear unable to pay for it themselves

24

or through insurance or public coverage they

25

already have.

That's why it's targeted at free

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
44
1
2

clinics.
Now there was a reference to

3

exemptions, and the exemption, leaving aside

4

the exemption for federal clinics, which I

5

think is obvious, the exemption for Medi-Cal

6

F-PACT providers reflects that a notice would

7

serve little purpose at a provider which

8

already provides care under those programs and

9

which has -­

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

11

MR. KLEIN:

12
13

I mean -­

-- the incentive to help

women enroll in them.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

One way to think about

14

how a statute like this gets enacted is to say

15

we're -- you know, we're really concerned that

16

there are low-income women, don't have a lot of

17

access to information, don't realize what all

18

their options are, want to make sure in general

19

and across the board that they get the best

20

information that's available to them.

21

Another way to think about what the

22

problem is and how a statute like this comes

23

about is more targeted.

24

these crisis pregnancy centers all over

25

California and we know that women just go into

It's to say there are

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

them and they don't realize what they are, and

2

they're being subject to being misled and we

3

think that this is a terrible problem.

4

And it might be that the -- you know,

5

that the state could legitimately view that as

6

a problem.

7

Whether it's a problem or not, it's much more

8

targeted than the first.

9

It's a much more targeted problem.

And I guess what I'm asking is, is

10

this the second kind of statute or is it the

11

first kind of statute?

12

MR. KLEIN:

It's the first kind of

13

statute, and the author's verbatim statements

14

about this -­

15

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, if it's the

16

first kind of statute, then why shouldn't this

17

Court take cognizance of the state's other

18

available means to provide messages?

19

it's about just ensuring that everyone has full

20

information about their options, why should the

21

state free-ride on a limited number of clinics

22

to provide that information?

23

MR. KLEIN:

If -- if

Well, Your Honor, the

24

state -- the legislature is aware of the

25

shortcomings of other methods, as evidenced by

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
46
1

the gap that has remained despite their efforts

2

to publicize.

3

Now what you describe as -- as

4

free-riding, I'd respectfully submit, is a

5

permissible speech requirement in the

6

professional context.

7

These -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, but if you're

8

trying to educate a class of -- of persons

9

about their rights, it's -- it's pretty unusual

10

to force a private speaker to do that for you

11

under the First Amendment.

12

MR. KLEIN:

Your Honor, I don't think

13

it's unusual to require a professional to

14

explain alternatives, as -- or additional

15

options that are available, as in Casey and

16

also as in the laws that have been cited in our

brief, the New York brief -­

24

Maybe you could finish your answer to Justice

25

Kagan's question.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

2

MR. KLEIN:

Let me ask first what is

the part -­

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

4

MR. KLEIN:

5
6

Yeah.

-- of Justice Kagan's

question she would like for me to -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yeah, I don't -- I

7

don't even remember which was the first kind of

8

statute anymore and which was the second kind

9

of statute.

But I was saying a state could

10

really be responding to a sort of

11

generalized -- a feeling that, in general, poor

12

women don't have access to information, or a

13

state could be responding to a -- a feeling

14

that there are a particular kind of a center

15

that is misleading women as to what they do and

16

don't provide.

17

And I can see this statute arising in

18

either of those two ways, and wanted you to

19

tell me why you thought it arose in the first

20

way and not in the second.

21

MR. KLEIN:

Right.

Well, let -- let

22

me say I don't think they're exclusive.

23

primary issue is women not knowing where they

24

can get the free care they need for all of

25

their options, including carrying a healthy

Heritage Reporting Corporation

The

Official
48
1

pregnancy to term and having a healthy baby.

2

But, obviously, the informational problem is

3

going to be especially concerning where there

4

are cases of deception and -- and so forth.

5

And the legislature had some awareness

6

of this, but they didn't draw a statute with

7

that as the primary principle.

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:
I give up on.

You see, that's what

I don't know.

I came away from

10

these briefs and I think I got the impression

11

that there are about 60 or so centers, maybe

12

70, that are really pro-life for religious

13

reasons of different kinds, all right?

14

they don't want to talk about abortions.

15

And

And then it seemed to me maybe there

16

are a thousand centers all together in

17

California, or several hundred, and I really

18

did end up wondering, well, you know, all those

19

centers, do the poor women really get the

20

information about free abortions?

21

idea.

22

I have no

I mean, the fact that they may have a

23

Cal medical thing doesn't mean they tell

24

everybody about it.

25

like.

I don't know what they're

So this is my question:

Don't we need a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
49
1
2

trial on this?
And I don't see -- I mean, I'm just

3

telling you right now I have no idea.

4

answers don't tell me.

5

You haven't told me whether women who don't go

6

to these 67 centers but do go to, say, 700, are

7

all informed whether the center is a -- is a -­

8

is a member of the Cal medical program or not.

9

And your

They're not empirical.

I don't know whether they're all

10

informed, and I suspect that you don't either.

11

And, therefore, I -- I -- I think trial, that's

12

what they're for.

What's the answer to that?

13

MR. KLEIN:

Your Honor, we agree.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MR. KLEIN:

You agree with that?

And the record at the

17

concerns, was not sufficient to support an

injunction.

both sides and that would -­

At a merits stage, there would

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What -­
Mr. Klein, can we

23

go back to the question Justice Kennedy asked

24

the other side, which was for you to affirm or

25

disaffirm that if one of these facilities wrote

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
50

an ad that just said pro-life and put their

2

name, it appears as if the law would require

3

them to have the statement "This is not a

5

MR. KLEIN:

I don't think so, Your

Honor, unless the facility was -- I mean, what

subjects a facility to the law, if it's

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So what

additional, what, ultrasounds or discussion of

family planning, what more would it take to

require the adoption center to be covered?

13

one of the ones that you have listed for

14

licensed centers?

15

MR. KLEIN:

In other words, what would

16

make it subjected to the same kind of

17

requirement as a licensed center?

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah.

At what

point -- you know, you say -- let's say that

ultrasounds are out of it.

still required for that facility?

22

MR. KLEIN:

Any

Is the disclosure

I don't think the

23

that facility?

MR. KLEIN:

It provides two

would be much more difficult to justify there.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I know.

That's why I'm asking the question.

(Laughter.)

22

MR. KLEIN:

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.
I'm trying to

24

figure out -- I'm trying to figure out the

25

limits of your argument.

I mean, the -- the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
53
1

centers here have a variety of services they

2

provide, and you say, because of that, we can

3

impose this requirement on them.

4

Now, before we can say yes or no to

your argument, I would like to know the limits

of it.

services and pregnancy testing, can they be

8

covered by your law?

So a facility that provides adoption

I don't know

what you mean by "through a licensed provider."

and they provide pregnancy testing.

They counsel on adoption

Could you require them to say, look,

19

there are other options you may want to

20

consider and, therefore, here's a disclosure

21

saying, you know, here are the facilities where

22

you can get other options?

23

MR. KLEIN:

On reflection, I think

24

probably not.

And here's the difference:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Klein, can we

go back to my question?

with respect to facility, and it requires a

facility to do one of -- two of four things

7

before it qualifies under the law.

8
9

I have read the law

So abortion -- you appear right that
they have to, one, offer ultrasounds,

10

obstetrics, sonograms, or prenatal care,

11

pregnancy -- or pregnancy testing or diagnosis,

12

or, three, prenatal monogram tests or

13

pregnancy, and, four, collect health data.

14

they have to do two or more of those things.

15

But

But let's go back to the question

Justice Kennedy asked.

care facilities says "pro-life" and their name.

I don't think you finished.

you're saying that on this billboard, you -­

the state can require that the message be -­

6

the content of the message be altered, even

Yes, Your Honor, because

the criteria are designed, not to see who's

providing medical services, that's taken care

11

of by our unlicensed practice law, it's

designed to address instances where the

groups.

15
16
17

That is on its face unconstitutional.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It didn't target it.

It included it.
MR. KLEIN:

So I think the statute is

reasonably read and applied in -- in

recognition of its purposes, which are the

injunction, the court was not -- and the

8

language issue wasn't raised at all on

9

preliminary injunction.

10
11

It's

And for a preliminary

So the court did not

abuse its discretion with respect to that.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What -- what about

12

-- there were legislative findings about false

13

and misleading representations.

14

ever brought charges against any of these

15

places for false and misleading advertising?

16

MR. KLEIN:

Has California

I'm not aware that the

17

state has.

18

of San Francisco has, for instance.

19

I believe that the City and County

But, in any case, that doesn't address

20

the -- such a procedure would not be superior.

21

First, that kind of -- policing that kind of

22

issue would not necessarily be more

23

speech-protective since it might involve

24

undercover patients, record subpoenas, site

25

visits and the rest.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But, counsel, it

2

would have the virtue of applying evenly to all

3

persons and all industries and a law that is

4

very familiar.

5

in commercial speech are well-known and -- and

6

don't pose any of the problems we've been

7

discussing today.

8
9

I mean, anti-fraud provisions

So why wouldn't that be a superior
mechanism for addressing these concerns, if -­

10

if we're talking about a narrower set of

11

concerns -­

12

MR. KLEIN:

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

14
15

Right.

So -­
-- just any fraud

concerns?
MR. KLEIN:

So the narrower concerns,

16

which are not the only ones here, it could be

17

significantly more or at least it's an open

18

question about whether it would be as or more

19

speech-intrusive to be really getting into

20

everything that the Petitioners are saying to

21

assess it, as opposed to requiring a

22

two-sentence notice that mostly obviates the

23

need for that because it gives women the

24

information to protect themselves and make

25

informed decisions in the very limited time

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
62
1

that they have available, simply by seeing the

2

notice to call the government.

3

And -­

4

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

The one -- the one

5

is prophylactic and requires you to compel

6

speech from someone else, that -- that

7

implicates First Amendment concerns.

8

second is -- puts the burden on the government

9

to prove that someone has abused their

10

The

free-speech rights.

11

And -- and this Court's normally

12

pretty jealously protective of speech.

13

isn't, again, that latter approach preferable?

14

MR. KLEIN:

So why

For -- for the same reason

15

that it wasn't a necessary step in Casey,

16

because, in the regulation of professional

17

speech, the government, given the close and

18

reliant relationship that the patient has on

19

her physician, can require a certain amount of

20

speech to ensure that the -- that the patient

21

makes informed decisions about very important

22

matters.

23

The main difference from Casey is how

24

much less burdensome this disclosure is because

25

there's more flexibility in how it can be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1

delivered and because it's only giving a phone

2

number for the patient to call and get

3

information from the government, rather than

4

requiring the physician to herself hand over a

5

complete state-written pamphlet, which is what

6

the disclosure in Casey required.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Would it be fair

8

to say -- and I still don't have a full answer

9

to my question -- all right, pro-life, nothing

10

else, a unlicensed facility, it meets all of

11

the criteria, has an ad that says just

12

"pro-life" and puts its name.

13

14
15

Yes or no?

MR. KLEIN:
criteria.

Yes, if it meets the other

And it's -­

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

MR. KLEIN:

18

Does it have to

Is that -- that -­

-- possible in an

as-applied challenge -­

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- seems to me

20

more burdensome and wrong because it's not tied

21

to an advertisement that is promoting medical

22

services.

23

MR. KLEIN:

24

It's possible that that kind of

25

May I continue?

as-applied challenge would result in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64

invalidating that application, but, as in

Ayadi, injunctive relief addresses particular

13

Thank you,

counsel.

6
7

Thank you.

MR. FARRIS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.
I'd like to first address Justice
Kagan's concern about the gerrymandering issue.

14

On page 5 of our reply brief in Note

15

2, we point out the state's website for where

16

the state tells low-income women how they can

17

go to private doctors and get information -- or

18

get services for pregnancy.

19

Yet those doctors are all exempt from

20

the -- this ad -- this Act, as are all

21

nonprofit clinics that have the general kind of

22

practice that Justice Alito's question

23

described.

24
25

As to the ad burden -- burden, the
amicus, Heartbeat International, on page 24 of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
65
1

their brief gave a mock-up of what an ad would

2

look like when you have simply pregnancy

3

questions and a phone number, and all the -­

4

the languages required in Los Angeles County.

5

That's what it would look like.

6

clearly burdensome.

7

And it's

And the unlicensed center, I think the

8

last answer from California was correct, is it

9

would be triggered if they were otherwise

10

mandated by the -- by the law.

11

I'd last like to turn -­

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The answer was that

13

-- that this was not brought up in this case

14

until now -­

15

MR. FARRIS:

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

Your Honor -­
-- and it should be

aired below.

18

MR. FARRIS:

Your Honor, that's not

19

correct.

It was raised below, as our reply

brief sets out.

21

in the briefing in the district court.

22

Heritage Reporting Corporation

The good for the goose, good for the

2

gander concern, here's what's going to happen

3

if California's law is upheld:

4

state is going to find out that there is no

5

difference anymore between people who perform

6

abortions and -- and those who counsel about

7

it, who talk about it.

8
9

A pro-life

If merely talking about abortion is
sufficient to require you to give pro-life

10

information, we have taken a big step in the

11

wrong direction of politicizing the practice of

12

medicine.

13

If everyone who recommends abortion

14

can have to give these kind of -­

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, that's -­

16

since it was mine, it's -- it's -- it's you

17

have to be a professional group giving advice

18

in a professional way.

19

think the goose and gander has to do with

20

everybody in the world.

It's not -- I don't

21

MR. FARRIS:

But -­

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

It has to do -- and

23

-- and there are things called plan -- family

24

planning clinics, et cetera.

25

MR. FARRIS:

Certainly, Your Honor.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
67
1

And so taking it on a narrow and then a broader

2

construction, the narrow construction, as I

3

understood your hypothetical, was a family

4

planning center that didn't actually perform

5

abortions but did all the other services.

6

I believe it would be unconstitutional

7

in a pro-life state to require that center

8

because -- to give a pro-life kind of

9

disclaimer that's -- was required in

10

Pennsylvania because they're not doing anything

11

that relates to the practice of medicine in

12

that context.

13

But taking the broader construction,

14

if we're not going to gerrymander this and say:

15

All doctors who treat pregnant women have to

16

give all the options.

17

case, doctors who advise to deliver and doctors

18

who advise to get abortions are going to be

19

swept into this requirement.

20

If -- if that's the

And the political ramifications of

21

that are enormous.

We should not politicize

22

the practice of medicine in that way.

23

line that Casey drew between performing

24

abortions versus advising about abortions is a

25

constitutionally appropriate line.
