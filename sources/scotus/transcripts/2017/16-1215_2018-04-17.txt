We'll hear

Mr. Garre.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. GARRE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

11

Section 523(a)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy

12

Code prohibits the discharge of debts procured

13

by fraudulent statements, other than a

14

statement respecting the debtor's financial

15

condition.

16

Everyone agrees that "financial

17

condition" is a term of art used by Congress

18

and in commercial practice to refer to one's

19

overall financial status.

20

the government ask this Court to interpret

21

Section 523 and, in particular, Congress's use

22

of "respecting" to eliminate the meaning of

23

"financial condition," of a term of art, and

24

essentially to substitute the word "finances"

25

for it.

Yet, Respondent and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
4
1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can you tell me,

2

Mr. Garre, what is a statement respecting

3

financial condition?

4

sheet and a profit and loss statement, what

5

else would qualify?

6

MR. GARRE:

In addition to a balance

Sure.

Well, our view is

7

that a statement respecting financial condition

8

is a statement that purports to present a

9

picture of one's overall financial situation.

10

And there are several things that could qualify

11

as -- as that.

12

One would, of course, be a classic

13

balance statement or sheet.

14

an indication of net -- net wealth or overall

15

income -- a net -- net worth.

16

a credit score, such as those that were common

17

in 1926, when Congress passed this statute.

18

Another would be net cash flow.

19

Another would be

Another would be

All of these things look to one's

20

overall financial situation, not to just one

21

side of the ledger, an asset or a liability,

22

and present a picture of overall financial

23

status.

24

And, again, Respondent's

25

interpretation of "respecting" essentially

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
5
1

eliminates that term as a term of limitation

2

and as a term of art and substitutes the word

3

"finances" for it.

4

individual input, any individual asset, any

5

individual liability suddenly becomes a

6

statement respecting financial condition.

7

So a statement about any

And I think there are three central

8

problems with -- with -- with Respondent's

9

interpretation of "respecting."

10

The first is, as I mentioned, that -­

11

that their reading of "respecting" to mean

12

"related to" eliminates Congress's decision to

13

use the term of art "financial condition."

14

would be an odd thing for Congress to say we're

15

going to refer to "financial condition" but

16

then essentially eliminate the meaning of that

17

by saying "respecting financial condition."

18

And there's no reason why the Court has to

19

interpret "respecting" to mean "related to."

20

It can mean "related to."

21

"about."

22

It

But it can also mean

And here in context, reading

23

"respecting financial condition" to mean a

24

statement about financial condition makes

25

perfect sense.

To say something is "about"

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
6
1

means it refers to the subject of the object.

2

Here, the object is the statement and here the

3

subject is financial condition, one's overall

4

financial status.

5

So the fact that their reading of

6

"respecting" to mean "related to" would

7

eliminate "financial condition" as a term of

8

art and a term of limitation is the first

9

reason why this Court -­

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could you tell me, Mr.

11

-- Mr. Garre, what you think the difference is

12

between "relating to" and "about"?

13

MR. GARRE:

I think, Your Honor, if -­

14

if you go to the dictionary, the dictionary -­

15

the definition that we provide for "about"

16

means "on the subject of."

17

subject -- the subject here is financial

18

condition.

19

It refers to the

"Relating to" is a much broader term

20

of breadth or at least can be used in that way.

21

I mean, this Court famously -- as Justice

22

Scalia famously said, everything is related to

23

everything essentially.

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

MR. GARRE:

Yeah -­

I mean, it's a term of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

great breadth.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So there's something

3

intuitive about what you just said, but then I

4

started trying to come up with sentences in my

5

head where I switched the two words, and I

6

honestly couldn't find one where they meant

7

something different.

8

I'm hoping you can help me come up with those

9

examples where -- you know, just give me a

So I'm -- I'm hoping -­

10

sentence where if you have "about," it means

11

something different than if you have "relating

12

to."

13

MR. GARRE:

Okay.

Tell me about Ted

14

Williams's batting average.

15

using "about" and we're also using "batting

16

average," which is a relative -- relative term,

17

versus:

18

batting average.

19

And, here, we're

Tell me something relating to his

And I think you could see in that

20

sentence that "relating to" is a much broader

21

term, going to capture things like, oh, well,

22

he struck out in the seventh inning versus,

23

well, you know, he hit 400.

24

season.

25

-- he was almost just as likely to hit the ball

It was an amazing

Or he -- he almost hit the ball just

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
8
1

as he was to not hit it.

2

about batting average.

3

That's a statement

Nobody would think that if you said

4

tell me about your GPA, and you said, well,

5

gee, I missed the -- the last question on my

6

last test, that that may be -- that's certainly

7

a statement relating to your GPA, that -- that

8

missing that question is going to impact, have

9

some relationship to your EPA, but you wouldn't

10
11

think of that as a statement about your GPA.
And that's the way in which Congress

12

was using "about" -- "respecting" here, as a

13

preposition to modify "financial condition."

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm -- Mr. Garre,

15

the problem I have with your example is if I

16

asked you tell me about your batting average

17

and you said, I hit 5 out of 10 or I hit 6 out

18

of 10, you would be answering that question, or

19

you could say I hit 5 out of 10 when I was in a

20

-- in a position to score a run.

21
22
23
24
25

So the "about" would be answered in
both ways.
MR. GARRE:

Well, I think, first of

all, are you referring to the subject -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The "respecting"

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
9
1

would be answered in both ways.

2

MR. GARRE:

Well, you're -- you're

3

referring to the subject, the batting average

4

there.

5

looked at both sides of the equation:

6

hits he got and how many times at bat he got.

7

So, in that sense, that's different than just

8

saying we're talking about an individual asset.

And your answer, actually, provide -­
How many

9

And then I think the sort of -- the

10

ambiguity in your question was, did you mean

11

his batting average in the game or his season?

12

And maybe that would be something you would

13

follow up on.

14

of that is perfectly consistent with our view,

15

and sort of -­

16

But I think that your expression

JUSTICE BREYER:

A problem.

You

17

produced an irresistible example which I can't

18

resist.

19

(Laughter.)

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

And, therefore, I

21

suspect that the key of your example is the

22

word -- the word "something," not the word

23

"respecting."

24
25

And when you say "tell me about," what
usually that means is "all about."

But let's

There, I'm with Justice Kagan; I have
a hard time seeing the difference.

7

MR. GARRE:

Well, Your Honor, "a

statement respecting" is still going to refer

9

to about his batting average, the subject of

10

it.

MR. GARRE:

Now you used

He hit the ball more than

22

23

statement respecting batting average, versus he

25

great catch.

That's not a statement respecting

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'll take it -- I'll

take it under consideration.

4

(Laughter.)

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

And what -- Mr. Garre,

6

what -- what trouble -- what if the debtor

7

makes a statement about a specific asset or a

8

liability, but anybody -- but the reasonable

9

listener would take that to be a statement

10

about or respecting financial situation?

11

MR. GARRE:

So our view, Justice

12

Alito, is this Court should follow what

13

Congress said and say that a statement about a

14

single asset or a single liability is not a

15

statement respecting financial condition.

16

just not.

17

It's

If you disagree with that, then I

18

think one fallback position the Court could

19

take would be something like what you said:

20

reasonable person would view that as a

21

statement about one's overall financial

22

situation.

23

A

Now this case couldn't be -- possibly

24

be viewed in that way because it was clear that

25

this was a statement about only a single asset

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1

and it was a statement in spite of his

2

financial condition.

3

So the Court couldn't possibly say

4

that the statement in this case, about an

5

individual tax refund, would be viewed, as a

6

reasonable person, in this context dealing with

7

a businessman, as a statement about -­

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
follow that.

I don't -- I don't

Maybe you can explain that.

I

10

thought this was a law firm that had a client

11

who was in default, and so the law firm said

12

we're going to stop representing you.

13

client said:

14

get a tax refund and it will enable me to pay

15

your bill.

16

Oh, don't do that.

And the

I'm going to

Why isn't that a statement reflecting

17

-- respecting the financial position, the law

18

firm knowing that the client was unable to pay,

19

wasn't paying his bills, and then the client

20

says:

21

assure you I will be able to pay this bill?

22

I can come up with something that will

MR. GARRE:

Sure.

And this is -- you

23

know, can come up in any number of situations

24

dealing with collateral, whereas it's not

25

uncommon for someone to know that another

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1

person is in dire financial straits but,

2

nevertheless, to accept collateral in exchange

3

for property or services as a means of paying

4

for that.

5

That's not a statement about overall

6

financial condition.

7

have an asset can be -- that can be used to pay

8

a debt.

9

It's a statement that I

And this case was litigated all the

10

way up on the premise that the statement at

11

issue here was a statement about his tax

12

refund, an individual asset.

13

that, in fact, what the law firm was relying

14

upon was its knowledge of his precarious

15

financial condition.

16

rejected that and found that, no, it was

17

relying on his statement about the tax refund.

18

They argued below

And the bankruptcy court

The district court rejected that,

19

found he was relying on -- it was relying on a

20

statement about the tax refund.

21

even think they appealed that finding to the

22

Eleventh Circuit.

23

And I don't

So I think that that's why this case

24

is truly the case about a statement about a

25

single asset, a -- a tax refund, that the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1
2

debtor in this case lied about.
And -- and this -- this paradigm here,

3

the sort of classic collateral paradigm, we're

4

talking about a single asset, couldn't be

5

further removed from the situation that

6

Congress was addressing.

7

And I know not all members of the

8

Court may want to look to that legislative

9

history, but it's sort of the gorilla -- it's

10
11

the elephant in the room here.
And that's that when Congress was

12

looking at this situation in 1978, what it was

13

doing is looking at a particular abusive

14

practice by some creditors, which were using

15

written financial statements essentially to

16

dupe applicants for credit into making false

17

statements by simply omitting debts or assets

18

on those statements, and then using that as

19

coercion once they went into bankruptcy.

20
21
22

And so Congress passed a specific rule
that dealt with written financial statements.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Mr. Garre, I'm not

23

sure I understand how that helps you even on

24

its own terms, assuming I'd be willing to look

25

at it, of course.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

But if Congress's concern is that

2

creditors are soliciting information that's

3

incomplete about debts, liabilities, that's

4

just half of the balance sheet that you want us

5

to look at.

6

So Congress appears to have been

7

concerned, to the extent we can tell these

8

things, about misstatements only with respect

9

to one-half of overall financial condition.

10

Right?

11

MR. GARRE:

Well, I don't think that's

12

completely correct, Your Honor, in the sense

13

that -­

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

15

MR. GARRE:

Good.

How?

-- that the legislative

16

record makes clear that the forms, the

17

financial statements that creditors were using,

18

were statements that referred to both

19

liabilities and assets.

20

financial statements about financial

21

conditions.

22

So those were

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Right.

No, I

23

understand that, but the concern is that the

24

misstatements were with respect to omitted

25

liabilities, right?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

MR. GARRE:

Congress -- the -- the

2

creditors in that situation were using forms

3

that represented one's overall financial

4

status, referring to a credit score, net worth

5

--

6

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But doesn't that

7

show that an omitted liability, one asset or

8

lack -- or one debt, can reflect on the overall

9

financial condition, that can be about and

10

relevant to and reflect on the overall

11

financial condition?

12

MR. GARRE:

It -- it certainly can be

13

related to.

But the question is what kinds of

14

statements was Congress addressing.

15

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, Congress

answer, one could say that you'd look to

whether a reasonable person in context would

your current debts as they come due.

18

MR. GARRE:

That -- that's not the way

19

Congress thought of it.

20

definition of insolvency, it refers to

21

"financial condition" first, and the difference

22

between assets and liabilities.

23

If you look at the

Congress also differentiated between

24

assets and liabilities and financial conditions

25

in other provisions, where it listed those

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
21
1

terms separately in 11 U.S.C. 1103(c)(2) and

2

1106(a)(3).

3

And -- and there's two different -­

4

two additional reasons why I don't think you

5

could read "respecting" in the broad "related

6

to" way that Respondent and the government ask

7

you to here.

8
9

The second -- the first one is that it
strips "financial condition" of meaning.

The

10

second one is that Congress used the term

11

"related to" in nearby provisions of the

12

statute, in both 1926 and 1978, showing that

13

when Congress meant "relating to," the broadest

14

conceivable definition, it said "relating to."

15

Not "respecting."

16

And the third reason is just the

17

consequences of Respondent's and the

18

government's rule.

19

baseline rule in Section 523, that debts

20

procured by fraud are not dischargeable,

21

inapplicable to a common fact pattern under

22

Section 523, which is statements made about

23

one's finances to secure credit.

Their rule would render the

24

Now the government itself on page 18

25

of its brief recognizes that that is a common

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
22
1

situation, someone making statements about

2

one's finances to -- to obtain credit.

3

the consequence of Respondent's and -- and the

4

government's rule is to wipe that out as a

5

basis for discharge.

And yet

6

And there's -- there's no indication

7

at all that Congress in mind -- that Congress

8

had in mind such a dramatic reshifting of the

9

ordinary regime that it has applied for a

10

century in this context, which is a debt

11

procured by fraud is not dischargeable.

12

And this Court relied upon similar

13

considerations, for example, in Maracich versus

14

Spears, where it refused to interpret an

15

exception to the Driver's Privacy Protection

16

Act, in such a broad manner that it would

17

really strike at the heart of the overlying

18

objective there.

19

And, here, we have a textually

20

grounded objective, that this Court has

21

recognized repeatedly, of not releasing, for

22

debtors, debts procured by fraud.

23

And I think one would look skeptically

24

to a rule that would wipe out the application

25

of that age-old rule in a commonly recurring

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
23
1

context, which is statements made about

2

finances.

3

And that's -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

that would need to be in writing.

10

MR. GARRE:

It would.

And I think

11

that the -- the fairest way to read that would

12

be a statement about financial condition.

13

that's quite different than a statement about

14

an individual asset.

15

coming up in the real world, Justice Ginsburg.

16

No reasonable creditor would rely on a

17

statement that general, but, in our view, that

18

is a statement respecting financial condition

19

that -­

And

That fact pattern is not

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How is -- how is

that significantly different from "don't worry,

I have an anticipated tax refund that will

MR. GARRE:

25

Right.

Because that -­

that's -- that goes to ability to pay, not

That's sort of the pay day situation that the

14

"Ability to pay" is a

Congress would have known that.

At

15

the time it enacted the "financial condition"

16

language initially, there were state laws that

17

referred to "financial condition" or "ability

18

to pay," as we mentioned in our reply brief.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But which says more

20

about your financial condition, Mr. Garre?

"I'm above water."

22

23

it."

24
25

MR. GARRE:

That's one option.

Or "I

"I'm above water" tells you about your

Official

financial condition.

2

tells you about your overall financial status.

3

The "I have a bank account with a billion

4

dollars in it" tells you you have a lot of

5

money.

It doesn't tell you anything about your

6

debts.

Really rich people sometimes have

7

really big liabilities.

8

And so that does not give you a sense of

9

overall financial status.

10

The "I" -- because it

Ask Bernie Madoff.

Now, again -- and I think that calls

11

into play Justice Alito's point, that if you

12

disagreed with that, then maybe that is the

13

kind of statement that one could look at and

14

say that that is so astronomically big, a

15

reasonable person would view that as a

16

statement about overall -- concerning about

17

overall financial situation.

18

That's not the rule we would urge this

19

Court to adopt.

We would urge you to follow

20

the text of what Congress said.

21

it's accepted by everyone that "financial

22

condition" is a term that refers to overall

23

financial status.

24

interpret the statute.

25

brings it in line with the problem that

And, again,

That's the easiest way to
It's the way that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
26
1
2

Congress sought to address.
And, again, I mean, just referring -­

3

returning to that problem briefly, there you

4

had a situation of a certain class of creditors

5

that were abusing written financial statements

6

that included assets and liabilities and duping

7

creditors -- debtors into making false

8

statements.

9

and essentially blameless debtors.

10

So you had blameworthy creditors

In that situation, Congress said you

11

should -- we should rebalance the scales and

12

not discharge those debts, unless they meet

13

certain additional requirements in (B).

14

Court recognized that in Field versus Mans,

15

which makes it a little bit different than the

16

typical legislative history case.

17

This

The government strenuously argued that

18

the Court should interpret 523(a)(2)(A) in

19

Field in light of that specific problem it was

20

seeking to address.

21

be further removed from the situation here,

22

where you have a creditor that is entirely

23

blameless and you have a debtor which had no

24

reason to be misled or mistaken about a single

25

individual asset, which is a point that Judge

And that problem couldn't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
27
1

Ebel made in the Joelson case.

2

So, in this case, there's no -- no

3

reason to think that Congress would have wanted

4

to balance the scales any differently.

5

instead, there's every reason to think that

6

Congress would have intended the baseline rule

7

that has always applied in this context to

8

apply to this situation, which is that a debt

9

procured by fraud is not dischargeable.

10

And,

Here, the district court and the

11

bankruptcy court both found that not only did

12

the debtor lie about his tax refund -- and I

13

think that the Respondent here has tried to

14

rehabilitate the debtor a little bit.

15

to be clear, there were findings made that he

16

lied about the amount of the tax fund and

17

whether or not they had actually received the

18

tax fund.

19

But just

Both times.
The -- the bankruptcy court found that

20

the deceit was obvious.

That's at page 60a of

21

the Petition Appendix.

22

Congress have intended to -- for a debtor

23

engaged in obvious deceitful conduct against a

24

creditor who's entirely blameless, to allow the

25

debtor to discharge that debt?

So why would have

When you think

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
28
1

about the consequences of the kind of behavior

2

that that would promote, there's no reason to

3

think that Congress would want to promote that

kind of behavior, certainly not when one looks

5

at -­

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why wouldn't the

7

result be to get people, especially law firms,

8

to do -- do things in writing?

9

MR. GARRE:

Well, and that -- and

10

that's an argument that -- that's a reason that

11

the -- the Eleventh Circuit gave, and that is

12

advanced by the Respondent here, not so much so

13

by the government.

14

sort of an example of the worst kind of

15

legislative purpose in the sense that there's

16

-- there's certainly no general statement of

17

purpose that Congress intended things to be in

18

writing generally.

19

And I think that that's

If Congress really had that objective,

20

Justice Ginsburg, it wouldn't have limited the

21

writing requirements to statements about

22

financial condition.

23

generally.

24
25

It would have applied it

Under their rule, they say that
statements about professional qualifications or

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
29
1

the values of assets are -- are different.

2

if Congress was really concerned about having

3

writing -- things in writing for evidentiary

4

purposes, it would apply that across the board.

5

But

So I don't think there's any real

6

traction to the notion that the -- the statute

7

should be interpreted in light of this unstated

8

objective to simply generate more reliable

9

evidence in proceedings.

10

Nor is there any indication that

11

courts have had difficulty making credibility

12

determinations about lies in this context.

13

Those were carefully litigated here.

14

courts below heard testimony, and they

15

concluded that the Respondent in this case lied

16

about the status of his tax refund and the

17

amount of his tax refund.

18

Both

Given that, this case falls within the

19

baseline rule that that debt is not

20

dischargeable.

21

and the government can pull that out of there

22

is to give "respecting" the broadest

23

conceivable breadth in terms of "relating to"

24

and then, once you get to that point, to ask

25

this Court essentially to impose judicial

The only way that Respondent

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
30
1

limits on the breadth of that term, because

2

even they, I think, appreciate that if

3

"respecting" really means "related to" here,

4

then this is really going to swallow up the

5

whole thing.

6

I mean, they -- they say that the

7

statement has to be about an asset, the

8

Respondent does, but why isn't a statement that

9

I run a hedge fund a statement relating to

10

one's financial condition?

11

might -- would reasonably view it that way.

12

Certainly, someone

Why isn't a statement that I graduated

13

first in my class from Harvard Business School

14

a statement respecting financial condition?

15

Certainly, it would be related to that.

16

And they're just asking this Court to

17

draw arbitrary limits in order to cabin the

18

reach of their rule.

19

slightly different approach and it asks this

20

Court to -- asks this Court to adopt an ability

21

to pay overview.

either, as I've explained.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL HUGHES

9

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

10
11

MR. HUGHES:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

12

Petitioner's principal textual

13

argument is to say, instead of looking to

14

"relating to," they prefer the word "about."

15

Now we reject the premise that there's any

16

substantial legal difference between those two

17

concepts.

18

difference, the only example that Petitioner

19

can offer that shows any difference is what we

20

would call a trivial example, something that's

21

a trivial impact on -- on the object.

22

But even supposing there is a

But in the context of this statute,

23

Section 523(a)(2), those sorts of trivial

24

examples structurally cannot exist.

25

because, in addition to demonstrating -- when a

And that's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
32
1

-- when a plaintiff comes forward with this

2

sort of claim, in addition to identifying the

3

-- the statement that the plaintiff alleges is

4

fraudulent, the plaintiff must also identify

5

why that statement was material to its

6

decision-making, why the plaintiff actually

7

relied on that statement, and why the plaintiff

8

at minimum was justified in doing so.

9

And so those requirements, those

10

necessary requirements of a Section 523(a)(2)

11

claim, necessarily and substantially limit the

12

universe of claims that could be within the

13

realm of statements respecting financial

14

condition.

15

And Congress was well aware that it

16

was crafting a statute about fraud.

17

knew of all of these other limitations that

18

cabined the universe of -- of the potential

19

kinds of claims.

20

court from having to consider these sorts of

21

trivial examples.

22

It well

And so that precludes any

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, let's -- let's

23

take Mr. Garre's example of the Harvard

24

Business School graduate.

I graduated from

25

Harvard Business School.

And someone might

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
33
1

reasonably rely on that and take it to be

2

material and significant.

3

to financial condition, overall financial

4

condition?

5

something?

6

But does it relate

Doesn't that term have to mean

MR. HUGHES:

So a few things about

7

that, Your Honor.

First, to directly answer

8

your question, we think that the clearest test

9

is to ask:

Does the statement describe what

10

would be a line item on one's balance sheet or

11

income statement?

12

way to understand what it directly relates to.

13

We think that's a very easy

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Okay.

All right.

14

So you'd rule it out on the basis that it has a

15

to be at least something that would appear on a

16

financial statement.

17

All right.

A lot of trivial things

18

appear on financial statements, right?

19

this, that, little asset.

20

secondhand car.

21

but it would appear on a financial statement.

22

That would be enough in your -- under your

23

rule?

24
25

I own a car.

I have
It's a

It's not worth a whole lot,

MR. HUGHES:

Well, yes, Your Honor.

And what would deal with that example is the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
34
1

materiality requirement.

2

rule is if you make that -­

3

But, again, their

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, no, no, it was

4

reasonably relied on for the purpose of the

5

loan or the services rendered or whatever, as

6

collateral, surely, of course, it was.

7

doesn't have anything to do with overall

8

financial condition.

9

very bad car.

10

MR. HUGHES:

But it

It just means I own a

Well, the question would

11

be the reliance theory there, Your Honor.

12

if they're relying on it, that statement,

13

because it says something about your financial

14

condition, I think that would be very clear

15

evidence that it goes to financial condition.

16

And

But, again, their test sets up a rule

17

where, if it appears on your balance sheet,

18

they agree (2)(B) applies in that circumstance.

19

The only question here is, if you make

20

that identical statement not in the context of

21

a balance sheet but standing alone, does all of

22

a sudden (2)(A) apply?

23

doesn't make any sense, because it's the

24

identical misstatement if you include a

25

misstatement about a -- a worthless car on your

And we think that rule

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

balance sheet and you make that identical

2

statement standing alone because the -- the -­

3

the loan officer comes and asks you the next

4

day:

5

automobiles we should -- we should know about?

6

By the way, do you have any additional

The rule they set up is, if you put it

7

on the balance sheet, (2)(B) applies, but if

8

you say it standing alone, all of a sudden

9

(2)(A) applies.

10
11

That's all form and no

substance.
The rule -- the difference -- the

12

distinction between (2)(A) and (2)(B) should

13

not turn on what the packaging of the

14

misstatement is, if it occurs on a balance

15

sheet or if it occurs independently standing

16

alone; it should look to what the -- what the

17

actual substance of the statement is.

18

And when the substance of the

19

statement is one that goes to financial status,

20

then it's a (2)(B) claim because it's a

21

statement that's respecting financial

22

condition.

23

And, again, it's clear that that is

24

this case.

One need look no further than their

25

amended complaint in the bankruptcy court.

6

And they say what -- why was the tax
And they say:

"It was

Their theory of materiality and

7

reliance was that this statement was material,

8

and they relied upon it because it went to his

9

financial status, his ability to pay.

That's

10

the identical reliance theory that the

11

bankruptcy court adopted at Petition Appendix

12

62a.

13

And so what our position is, is that a

14

-- a creditor should not be able to, on the one

15

hand, identify for purposes of -- of

16

establishing reliance and materiality that the

17

reason -- the actual reason they relied on this

18

was because it was a statement about financial

19

condition while at the same time, in -- in

20

trying to avoid the requirements of (2)(B) say

21

no, no, this was something that is not

22

respecting financial condition because it

23

didn't have the proper form of being on a full

24

balance sheet.

25

The reality, when -- when a creditor

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
37
1

relies for this actual reason, that is what

2

should govern the (2)(A)/(2)(B) analysis.

3

else, again, you lead to these bizarre results,

4

as I said, it shouldn't matter the truthful

5

packaging.

6

Again, as -- as -­

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Or

Your -- your -­

8

your understanding shrinks what would once fit

9

under (2)(A).

10

So what remains under (2)(A)

when you don't have a writing requirement?

11

MR. HUGHES:

So, Your Honor, a

12

substantial amount remains under (2)(A), as 34

13

years of Fourth Circuit practice have shown,

14

and that's because most of the claims -- most

15

plaintiffs under Section 523(a)(2) are not

16

lenders.

17

fraud claims that are entirely outside the loan

18

context.

19

Most plaintiffs have a variety of

And so just to look at this Court's

20

recent 523(a)(2) cases, two years ago, the

21

Court considered Husky International

22

Electronics about fraudulent conveyance, which

23

was a (2)(A) case.

24
25

Prior to that, the Court looked at
Cohen v. de la Cruz, which was a case about a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
38
1

fraudulent scheme to overcharge rents, in

2

violation of state law.

3

case.

4

That was a (2)(A)

Prior to that, in Grogan, with

5

securities fraud, that was a (2)(A) case.

6

of these cases that deal with fraud entirely

7

outside the lending capacity come up as (2)(A)

8

cases.

9

approach has governed in the Fourth Circuit,

10

and (2)(A) is -- is very much alive and well

11

there.

12

All

And as we've said, for 34 years, our

We documented dozens of examples of

13

all sorts of frauds; for example, when somebody

14

misrepresents the quality of service or the

15

goods that they're selling and a whole panoply

16

of -- of issues that have been addressed as

17

(2)(A) cases in the Fourth Circuit, which has

18

applied Angler for -- for the past 34 years.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

In saying that, are

20

you saying that (2)(A) does not really exist

21

anymore with respect to fraud on lenders?

22

MR. HUGHES:

No, it still can exist

23

for fraud with lenders, particularly when

24

somebody is making a statement at the time of

25

obtaining debt as to a future promise.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official
39
1

there, the fraudulent claim would not be what

2

about their financial condition, but something

3

that they are going to do in the future,

4

perhaps how they use the proceeds of a loan or

5

if they're going to convey ownership interests

6

of the person who's giving them the loan.

7

So there still is a role for (2)(A) in

8

the context of lending.

But the context of

9

this statute, Congress was quite clear in -- in

10

creating (2)(B) where it intended to have

11

(2)(B) apply in the main in the lending

12

capacity, that was because Congress recognized

13

that there was a pattern and practice of abuses

14

in the particular consumer lending space.

15

that's why Congress felt the need to impose

16

heightened consumer protections in the -- in

17

the (2)(B) context.

18

And

And we think it would be a bizarre

19

result if those protections could be

20

circumvented by a rule, such that if the lender

21

asks for everything but overall financial

22

condition, if they just ask for the three most

23

important assets and the three most important

24

debts, all of a sudden those protections would

25

cease to apply, even though the -- the creditor

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
40
1

is getting the identical information that they

2

want from getting a holistic balance sheet.

3

So the context of this statute, we

4

think, very clearly indicates why Congress

5

would prefer for an approach that applies to

6

statements about single assets, every bit as

7

much as a statement about an overall balance

8

sheet.

9

In -- in addition to -- to that

10

particular purpose, the very example that

11

Congress gave in enacting the statute was a

12

list of debts, only something on the debtor's

13

bankruptcy court decision, In re Hill, where

15

Bankruptcy Judge Baer very clearly explained

16

that the kind of example that Congress had in

17

mind was not the kind of -- of document from

18

which overall net worth could be obtained.

19

So the very example that Congress

And Congress had cited to a

20

enacted or identified for purposes of (2)(B)

21

would not be captured by Petitioner's rule,

22

which I think would be a surprising result.

23

Beyond that, we know that Congress had

24

in mind that (2)(B) would have real effect, and

25

that's because the 1970 Bankruptcy Commission,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

when it issued its report in 1973, it

2

recommended doing away with this exemption to

3

bankruptcy in its entirety.

4

the whole, it was doing more harm than good to

5

the public.

6

It found that, on

Now Congress said we're not going to

go that far.

(Laughter.)

18

MR. HUGHES:

Your Honor, though, to be

19

clear, our principal argument rests on the text

20

of the statute.

21

resolves this case.

22

going to these other sources are -- are

23

necessary.

24
25

And we think that that
We -- we don't submit that

We think the text is clear, but to the
extent that there's any possible ambiguity, we

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
42
1

-- we don't believe there is any, but we think

2

all of these other points line up behind it,

3

because along the same line, prior to the 1978

4

recodification, five circuits had looked at

5

materially identical language, and they all

6

reached the same result.

7

Again, we think the text is the most

8

compelling basis for the Court to decide this

9

case, but the fact that the text, the

10

legislative history, the -- the statutory

11

lineage, and the clear purpose all line up the

12

same direction, we think indicates why the

13

Eleventh Circuit was absolutely correct in its

14

-- its decision with this case.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

the argument Mr. Garre -- Garre did?

17

the Congress was seeking to -- to protect

18

debtors where credit companies were telling

19

them to omit a particular item.

20

MR. HUGHES:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

He said

Yes, Your Honor.
How does this rule

protect those creditors?

23

MR. HUGHES:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

May I go back to

How -­
Because, if the

debtor provides the balance sheet in writing

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
43
1

but omits something that the creditor asks -­

2

tells them it's not -- it's unimportant, why

3

does the writing requirement save the debtor?

4

It doesn't really.

5
6
7
8
9

MR. HUGHES:

Well, Your Honor, that's

because -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It doesn't save

the debtor because -­
MR. HUGHES:

Your Honor, in (2)(B),

10

there were two particular protections.

11

the writing requirement, and you're correct,

12

the writing requirement would not apply.

13

the other distinction between (2)(A), which

14

does the work in that case, is the reasonable

15

reliance requirement.

16

One was

But

Congress enhanced the standards from

17

justifiable reliance, which typically does not

18

require any affirmative duty to investigate, to

19

reasonable reliance, which would include a duty

20

to investigate, particularly for that example,

21

because they said creditors, because they get

22

consumer reports and other kinds of information

23

from credit rating agencies, they can either

24

know or pretty easily find out if that -- if

25

that statement is incomplete.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
44
1

And so the reasonable reliance

2

requirement is what -- what takes care of those

3

cases.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Would you respond to

5

-- to Mr. Garre's argument that the statement

6

here concerns ability to pay and not financial

7

condition?

8

MR. HUGHES:

Well, it's hard for me to

9

see the distinction between those two, Your

10

Honor, because I think people are concerned

11

about ability-to-pay statements because they go

12

to financial condition, and vice versa,

13

financial condition statements are -- are

14

relevant to condition -- to ability to pay.

15

But, again, as the government says,

16

ability to pay is a very important part of this

17

test.

18

identify a separate way to look at financial

19

condition, which is not just balance sheet

20

solvency but is equitable solvency, which goes

21

to ability to pay.

22

We have two separate amicus briefs who

So I think another way to look at this

23

case is a statement that shows ability-to-pay

24

liquidity is a statement that goes to financial

25

condition.

I think it's very hard to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

disaggregate those two.

2

And this is obviously a statement

3

about ability to pay.

4

confirm that it is a statement respecting

5

financial condition.

6

And so I think that does

Now I -- I think the one distinction

7

that they try to make at page 14 of the yellow

8

brief is that there was a model code that -­

9

back in 1926 that looked to statements

10

respecting financial condition and the means of

11

ability to pay, and they try to suggest that

12

since only "statement respecting financial

13

condition" was plucked from that model code,

14

that "means of ability to pay" is something

15

different.

16

That "means of ability to pay," the

17

language in the context of that model code, was

18

doing something very different.

19

applying to what we today think of payment from

20

insiders.

21

the jewelry store and you say:

22

have the ability to pay, I'm not going to make

23

a representation about my financial condition,

24

but my very wealthy grandmother is going to

25

come tomorrow and pay for this diamond, that is

It was

So, for example, if you show up at
Well, I don't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
46
1

a representation about your means of your

2

ability to pay, which is distinct from your

3

financial condition.

4

So the distinction that they try to

5

make in the yellow brief at page 14 is -- is

6

about those third-party ability of means to

7

pay.

8

don't think there's much distinction between

9

"financial condition" and the "ability to pay."

When you take those third parties out, I

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the

11

argument that you would be putting a burden on

12

small businesses that deal informally?

13

would be putting a recordkeeping requirement on

14

them for a statement like:

15

refund.

16

MR. HUGHES:

You

I've got this tax

Well, so, Your Honor,

17

this rule has applied for 34 years in the

18

Fourth Circuit, and neither Petitioner nor its

19

amici have come up with a shred of evidence

20

that there has been any untoward policy effect

21

on small business or any other sector of the

22

economy.

23

And I think we know exactly why,

24

because the NFIB amicus brief cites its own

25

report, and its report, at page 8, concludes

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
47
1

that bankruptcies are not significant problems

2

for small business.

3

other problems that small businesses have in

4

obtaining payment, and it says bankruptcies are

5

relatively insignificant.

6

It goes through all the

And then that same report, at page 6,

7

explains why, beyond that, that small

8

businesses stand to benefit more from expansive

9

rules that protect debtors for the very reason

10

that small business owners are more likely to

11

be debtors in bankruptcy cases than the general

12

population.

13

So the NFIB's own evidence suggests

14

that -- that bankruptcies like this do not pose

15

any practical problem on small businesses,

16

beyond that -- that these sorts of rules help

17

small business owners who are more likely to

18

declare bankruptcy.

19

empirical evidence, even though we know our

20

rule has governed for 34 years in the

21

Carolinas, Virginias, and Maryland, and there's

22

been no indication of any sort of overreach of

23

-- of recordkeeping.

And there's just simply no

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you

25

know, we -- we get these arguments a lot.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

This

no empirical evidence.

6

anything like that.

I mean, there are a lot of

8

The fact that there haven't been that

9

many reported decisions, which I assume is the

10

basis for your statement it hasn't been a

11

problem, doesn't really tell you all that much

12

in cases like this.

13

MR. HUGHES:

Well, I think, Your

14

Honor, the -- the point that we make is a -- is

15

a more limited one, which is to say if the sky

16

were falling in the Fourth Circuit, there would

17

be some evidence or some outcry from these very

18

substantial jurisdictions.

19

indication that there was a problem that -­

20

that came from this rule.

21

There would be some

So we're using this -- the -- the

22

absence of evidence in the Fourth Circuit to

23

simply say that any view of a policy concern is

24

substantially overblown, because there hasn't

25

been any identification of even a single case

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
49
1

where there have been imposition of

2

recordkeeping obligations that have been deemed

3

improper or any sort of improper cost on small

4

businesses.

5

And, again, I think when we look to

6

the NFIB evidence, that shows exactly why.

7

This is just not a problem that, in the

8

aggregate, was of concern to small businesses;

9

and, rather, Congress was looking at this as

10

consumer protection, how it dealt with consumer

11

lending in the aggregate, and that's why it

12

drafted the broad statute that it did to

13

preclude any kinds of circumvention, because,

14

again, a rule to the contrary would -- would

15

lead to a result where if, you know, Appling

16

had not just said I'm getting a $100,000

17

refund, but I'm getting a $100,000 refund and,

18

therefore, my head is above water, that all of

19

a sudden (2) -- (2)(B) would apply.

20

That's just all form over substance,

21

and there's no reason to think that -- that

22

Congress would have actually done that.

23

think our rule accords with what actual

24

creditor behavior is, and that should be the

25

rule of decision that Congress was concerned

Heritage Reporting Corporation

So we

Official
50
1

about substances.

2

Additionally, as I've said, our rule

3

captures the -- the only single example that

4

Congress gave.

5

rule is just plainly required by the -- the

6

clear text of the statute, that the word

7

"respecting" has a broadening function, there's

8

been no indication that it has anything but a

9

broadening function, and regardless if one

And -- and finally, I think our

10

thinks it's "relating to," "respecting,"

11

"about," all of that broadening function leads

12

to the very same rule that the Eleventh Circuit

13

adopted below, where statements about assets

14

and liabilities necessarily qualify.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could -- could you

16

tell me how you think -- why you think your

17

rule is better than the Solicitor General's

18

suggestion?

19

MR. HUGHES:

20

superior for several reasons.

21

Congress's goal of extending debtor protection

22

to this range of claims because, but for our

23

rule -­

24
25

Well, our rule is -- is

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It accomplishes

rule different from the Solicitor General's?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

MR. HUGHES:

Oh, sorry.

Sorry.

Apart

from the Solicitor General's rule, I don't

think our -- our approach has any pragmatic

4

difference.

5

the examples, and I can't think of an example

6

where our rule departs from where the Solicitor

7

General's rule would come out.

8

rule is a bit -- is -- is straightforward and

9

-- and an easy one to apply.

10

I've -- I've thought through all

We think our

But I think, in all of these cases, if

11

you think of ability to pay as either a

12

requirement of the rule -­

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So

14

articulate your rule and articulate them for me

15

so that I have a clear idea of the differences.

16

MR. HUGHES:

Sure.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So -­
I know they spoke

18

about context and purpose, and you didn't.

19

So -­

20

MR. HUGHES:

Yes, Your Honor.

Our

21

rule is that any statement that has a direct

22

impact on one's overall financial condition,

23

which Petitioner defines as the balance of

24

assets and liabilities, is a statement

25

respecting financial condition.

So we think an

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
52
1

easy way to think of this is, if it's a

2

statement describing a single line item on a

3

balance sheet or an income statement, that's

4

what qualifies.

5

The government's rule is they -- they

6

say it's "an affirmative representation about a

7

single asset if that representation is offered

8

as evidence of the debtor's ability to pay."

9

So they add that "if evidence of debtor's

10

ability to pay."

11

We think that's just descriptive of

12

what's going to happen in these cases, rather

13

than something that has to be added as a test.

14

They offer this example of -- of items in

15

commerce.

16

same way with items in commerce, just when one

17

thinks about the timing of the transaction,

18

because when that transaction closes, the

19

representation one's relying upon that the good

20

is genuine isn't about something on one's

21

balance sheet; it's about an item that's

22

actually being transmitted in commerce and it's

23

coming off one's balance sheet.

24

time of reliance, it's -- it's not a balance

25

sheet style statement.

We think our rule would come out the

So, at that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

So I don't think there's any practical

2

difference between where we are and where the

3

Solicitor General is.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY E. SANDBERG
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS
CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SANDBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Our view and Respondent's view of the

14

statute leaves the no-discharge rule in fraud

15

cases basically intact.

16

interpreting the scope of the statute's

17

provision that says that statements need to be

18

in writing.

19

Respondent's counsel makes clear, although some

20

statements might indeed be insignificant, the

21

dollar bill in my pocket or, by analogy, a

22

single at bat of Ted Williams, the statute's

23

only concerned with representations that have

24

actual effect on creditor behavior.

25

We're just

And as the colloquy with

And the determination whether a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
54
1

statement is one respecting financial condition

2

or not will make a practical difference only

3

when the creditor has actually relied on it and

4

the reliance was, at a minimum, at least

5

justifiable.

6

And the creditor who has relied on a

7

statement about the value of a single asset,

8

such as here a tax refund, has done so for

9

exactly the same purpose that one would

10

customarily rely on a comprehensive financial

11

statement for, which is to form a judgment

12

about the debtor's creditworthiness for

13

purposes of consummating or not consummating a

14

particular transaction.

15

So "a statement respecting financial

16

condition" is ultimately about the topic of the

statement.

5

been interpreted by courts over the years to

6

extend beyond statements about overall

financial condition, to include statements

8

about particular assets under circumstances

9

where a creditor had relied on that statement

11

It had existed in prior
And it had

and -- and been defrauded.
It's also worth bearing in mind that

the 1970s was the Commission's report.

14

the two bills that was before Congress in the

15

'70s was drafted by the Commission.

16

Commission included four legislators of the

17

nine members, and the hearings were all about

18

what had happened before the Commission, what

19

the Commission was proposing.

20

striking that the Commission had proposed to

21

eliminate the fraud exception to discharge

22

entirely for consumer debts, not just for false

23

financial statements, for all -- for all

consumer debts.

2

that this -- for the particular class of

3

statements that deal with financial condition,

4

the representation would need to be in writing

5

if the creditor sought to render that claim

6

non-dischargeable in the bankruptcy -­

7

But it ultimately preserved a rule

JUSTICE ALITO:

You say that a

8

statement respecting the debtor's financial

9

condition "encompasses an affirmative

10

representation about a single asset if that

11

representation is offered as evidence of the

12

debtor's ability to pay," right?

13

MR. SANDBERG:

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

So it's -­

That's right.
That goes -- it is the

15

intent of the person making the statement, the

16

subjective intent of the person making the

17

statement?

18

MR. SANDBERG:

No, we see it as an

19

objective test -- test that turns on the

20

context in which the statement is made.

21

a creditor hearing that statement in the

22

context in which the statement was made -- and,

23

remember, what -- we're talking here about oral

24

statements because it only makes a

really.

them is a genuine Vermeer -­

Here are the three significant

JUSTICE ALITO:

So, if the debtor

makes the statement not intending it to be

evidence of -- to be taken as evidence of the

12

debtor's ability to pay, but it is taken in

13

that way by the creditor, that counts or a

14

reasonable creditor would take it that way?

15

MR. SANDBERG:

I think a reasonable

16

creditor gets closest to the -- the right

17

approach.

18

areas of the law this Court has looked to, in

19

discerning the purpose of a statement, has

20

applied an objective test, such as, for

21

example, whether an out-of-court statement is

22

testimonial or not.

It's an objective test.

In other

23

And -- and we think that it's

24

important for it to be objective just so that a

25

creditor doesn't come into court when it files

its complaint in the adversary proceeding and

say:

Your -- your test -­

I'm sorry, please.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Hughes said that

8

there was really no practical difference

9

between your test with the evidence of

10

ability-to-pay language in it and his test

11

without it.

12
13
14

Do you disagree with that or agree
with that?
MR. SANDBERG:

As I understand

15

Respondent's position, there -- there is no

16

practical difference in how it turns out.

17

We're really -- the point of our ability-to-pay

18

language is -- is to get at what we think

19

Congress was trying to do here.

20

And one can agree or disagree as a

21

general matter with its policy choice, but what

22

we think Congress was trying to do was treat

23

statements that go to a debtor's ability to pay

24

differently than -- than other types.

25

So a statement respecting financial

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
59

condition is -- is one made for the purpose of

2

shedding light on one's financial condition.

would be taken by a -- a reasonable creditor as

having any significant bearing on financial

14

condition?

15

MR. SANDBERG:

Well, I think that that

16

statement probably would not be material or it

17

would not be one that the creditor would have

18

reasonably relied upon.

19

talking about circumstances in which a creditor

has come into court and said:

This statement that was made was so significant

22

that I made a different lending decision than I

But then they -- they turn -- when it

statement wasn't significant enough to go to

the debtor's overall financial condition.

wasn't -- that couldn't have been intended as

17

MR. SANDBERG:

Why don't we

I think that's right.

18

I don't think we are looking to the debtor's

19

intent under our approach.

20

looking at what an objective observer coming at

21

things from the creditor's side of the

22

transaction would understand the statement to

23

have been made for.

24

the debtor's ability to -- to pay or not?

25

I think we're

Was it to shed light on

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

We've been focusing

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

1

on the balance sheet, and that's where your

2

focus has been.

3

appear on a financial statement?

4

Is it an asset?

Would it

But what about an income statement or

5

a representation about a future stream of

6

income that wouldn't appear on a balance

7

statement but might appear on an in -- income

8

statement?

9

daylight between your -- your position and your

10
11

I understood there to be a little

colleagues' on that.
MR. SANDBERG:

I think our approach

12

would cover those statements because we think

13

that they are financial representation -­

14

representations that go to ability to pay.

15

not sure whether Respondent's counsel would say

16

that their approach doesn't sweep that in.

17

think they also have referred to income or debt

18

statements, in addition to balance sheets.

19

I'm

I

And in that sense, where -- the

20

government's approach isn't tethered to any -­

21

the formality of the particular document or

22

what would appear on any particular document.

23

It's really about the purpose to which the

24

statement -­

25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, but you talked

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
62
1

about assets or liabilities.

2

doesn't necessarily represent income, future

3

income streams.

4

MR. SANDBERG:

That -- that

That's right.

The

5

articulation of the government's test that my

6

colleague read sort of baked into it the

7

premise of this case, which was a statement

8

about a single asset.

9

And so I don't know that this Court

10

would need to think about the entire universe

11

of representations in -- in order to resolve

12

it, but certainly a statement that is not just

13

about an asset or a liability but is about an

14

income or an expenditure would also fall within

15

our approach.

16

So -- and as to why the Congress may

17

have required statements to be in writing, it's

18

true that it could have said much more in the

19

legislative history than -- than it did, but we

20

know one thing for a fact from the face of the

21

statute.

22

And everyone agrees about it.
Congress did require statements to be

23

in -- in writing if they're respecting

24

financial condition in order for the creditor

25

to prevail.

Congress could have written in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1

(2)(A) "a statement in writing respecting

2

financial condition," but it didn't.

3

"statement respecting financial condition."

4

It said

And then, in (2)(B), it imposed a

5

writing requirement.

6

only way to -- to give -- we don't see how

7

under Petitioner's approach it would be

8

sensible to distinguish between statements that

9

-- that go to the whole and statements that go

10

to some or most or -- or one.

11
12

I'd be happy to entertain any further
questions that the Court may have.

13
14

And we think the -- the

counsel.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

17

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

18
19
20

MR. GARRE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.
The rule advanced by Respondent and

21

the government would essentially wipe out the

22

application of 523's baseline rule in the

23

consumer finance or simple collateral

24

situation.

25

The government says itself on page 18

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64
1

of its brief that statements respecting

2

debtors' finances are, of course, common in

3

credit transactions.

4

you've just heard today, any false statements

5

about finances are going to result in a debt

6

that's not dischargeable, if they're made

7

orally, which, as the National Federation of

8

Independent Businesses has told this Court,

9

statements about finances are still made orally

And under the rule that

10

in common transactions throughout the United

11

States by small businesses and regular folks.

12

And there's just absolutely no

13

indication that Congress intended to put

14

creditors who are blameless in a situation

15

where the debts created by deceitful debtors

16

are going to be entirely discharged under this

17

rule.

18

The Fourth Circuit case law only

19

proves that the Fourth Circuit has invented

20

artificial limits on Respondent's "related to"

21

principle.

22

show is all the debts about false statements,

23

about individual assets that are being

24

discharged in the Fourth Circuit and putting

25

creditors in hardship situations that Congress

What -- what that case law doesn't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
65
1

did not intend to be discharged.

2

think the Fourth Circuit case law really gets

3

them anywhere.

4

So I don't

The -- the problem in this case is

5

completely different than the problem that

6

Congress had in mind.

7

debtors and creditors make a false statement

8

about a single asset in the classic kind of

9

collateral situation, where a -- there's no

We're talking about

10

reason to think that the creditor is

11

blame-worthy in any way and where the -- the

12

debtor is entirely deceitful.

13

In that situation, there's no

14

evidence, either in the text or the history,

15

that Congress intended to weigh the balance in

16

favor of debtors there and excuse debtors by

17

discharging debts procured by fraud.

18

The ability-to-pay concept is just

19

different than financial condition.

20

on a $1,000 loan, you may be able to use that

21

collateral to pay the loan, but that has no

22

bearing on your overall financial situation.

23

Collateral

Lots of people who are in dire

24

financial situations make statements about

25

collateral in order to make loans.

And a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
66
1

lender might look at the statement about a

2

piece of property as evidence of an ability to

3

pay, but that is not evidence of one's overall

4

financial condition.

5

And one thing, ironically, that I

6

didn't hear from either Respondent or the

7

government today is any real argument based on

8

the text of the statute, either "respecting,"

9

which they've relied upon up to this point, or

10

"financial condition."

11

dispute that "financial condition" does refer

12

to one's overall financial status.

13

Nor did I hear them

And I didn't hear any explanation as

14

to how their "related to" interpretation of

15

"respecting" doesn't negate that term as a term

16

of art and term of limitation.

17

The last thing I would say is, if this

18

Court does adopt a new test in this area, and

19

there have been, you know, competing versions

20

of possibilities for this Court, we would urge

21

this Court to vacate the decision below and to

22

remand.

23

For one thing, there's -- there's a

24

dispute among the parties about exactly why

25

Respondent made a false statement about the tax

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
67
1

refund, whether Lamar was relying on its

2

overall financial status.

3

The courts below heard that and

4

rejected the Respondent's position that he

5

advanced today.

6

at pages 60 to 61 of the Petition Appendix and

7

39 and 40 of the Petition Appendix, where the

8

courts below held that we relied on the

9

statement about his tax refund and not his

10

And I would urge you to look

overall financial condition.

11

And because we relied on a statement

12

about a single asset and not a statement about

13

his overall financial condition, and because

14

that statement was indisputably false, the debt

15

at issue in this case should not be discharged

16

under the command of Congress.

17

If there are no further questions.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
