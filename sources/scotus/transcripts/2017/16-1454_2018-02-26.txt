MR. MURPHY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The government met its initial burden

14

to show anticompetitive harm in this case under

15

the rule of reason by proving that American

16

Express's anti-steering provisions have stifled

17

interbrand price competition and raised the

18

prices that all four credit card companies

19

charge merchants.

20

horizontal effects because they bar merchants

21

from accurately informing their retail

22

customers about the different costs of credit

23

cards and from offering them incentives, such

24

as price discounts, to use cheaper cards.

25

The restraints have these

As a result, retail customers make

Well, you have proof

that not all of the increased price that

That's not my question, however.

My question is, do you have any

evidence that, on a net basis, consumers pay

15

more?

consumers in this context.

consumers.

MR. MURPHY:

For the cardholder

side.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Isn't that true,

given American Express's tying or -- or

3

restriction that no merchant can offer a

4

consumer a 5 or 10 or other discount for using

5

Visa, MasterCard, or Discover, correct?

6

MR. MURPHY:

Absolutely correct.

It

7

has restricted competition on that side of the

8

market in the sense of they have less options.

9

An Amex cardholder who would prefer to have a

10

1 percent discount, if the Amex cardholder uses

11

a Discover card, merchants aren't allowed to

12

offer that option.

they would if these anti-steering rules were

impact of restricting intrabrand competition in

that respect, but we learned through painful

experience and many, many years that they're

2

generally pro-competitive, right?

3

MR. MURPHY:

So it's not all

4

interbrand restraints.

So the classic

5

manufacturer/distributor restrictions only

6

affect interbrand competition in order to

7

promote interbrand competition.

8

hypothetical was about exclusive dealing, which

9

I would admit affects interbrand competition.

10

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

11

MR. MURPHY:

Your

Right.

That's why the Court has

12

suggested, generally speaking, they -- they are

13

problematic if they tie up too many buyers or

14

sellers.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We have a

16

wonderful amicus brief that explains that when

17

you have exclusive dealing, the competition

18

doesn't become a competition for selling that

19

product but for selling all the competing

20

products, correct?

21

MR. MURPHY:

Correct.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So -­

So that if this

car dealership raises its prices too high,

other car manufacturers are going to be able to

give you a lower price car, perhaps of equal

MR. MURPHY:

Absolutely correct.

That's why this is so fundamentally different

from the manufacturer/distributor restraints

that the Court addressed in Leegin.

6

restraints, the Court made quite clear, that

7

resale price maintenance, for example,

interbrand competition acted as a critical

is a multi-sided platform exercise?

7

MR. MURPHY:

I generally think that

8

output is very significant, but in this case, I

think the higher prices go hand in hand with

the restricted output.

conclusion was that the output -- that this is

20

MR. MURPHY:

That's what -- that's

21

what I want to make clear, that we have clear

22

evidence of direct causation that the

23

restraints cause higher merchant prices.

24

With respect to the restraints' effect

on output, there is just no evidence one way or

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Does output include

premiums to -- or rewards to customers?

9

Output has been expanding, but that

MR. MURPHY:

Yeah.

Out -- output

would include quality considerations as well.

10

But -- so we're talking about just the

11

government's initial case here, and as this

12

Court said, higher prices restrict output in

any -- any market with downward-sloping demand

curves.

15

That's why all the circuit courts say

showing either higher prices or restricted

MR. MURPHY:

I don't -- I don't think

it does whatsoever, because I think this

13

Court's cases, Catalano, National Professional

14

Society of Engineers, all suggest that a

15

competitor cannot impose a price restraint or

16

restraint on one product attribute in order to

17

channel it to other product attributes.

18

it would be merchant fees and cardholder

19

rewards.

20

Here,

The Court -- the Court's cases clearly

21

suggest that competition itself should

22

determine the appropriate ratio between quality

23

and price considerations in -- in the Court's

24

prior cases, Indiana Dentist, or in this case,

merchant fees and cardholder rewards.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Could -- could you

3

please comment on the Second Circuit's view

4

that what's involved is a credit card

5

transaction and that includes both services to

6

merchants and services to cardholders and you

7

can't just deal with one and ignore the other.

8
9

MR. MURPHY:

So I still think that

even if under the -- taking the Second

10

Circuit's premise as a given, which is this is

11

just one market, we disagree.

12

that market analysis should be divided

13

separately.

14

We think that

But even taking their argument as a

15

premise, their argument is that they can

16

restrict competition with respect to one

17

product attribute in order to channel it to

18

other product attributes.

19

And I think that's fundamentally

20

inconsistent with this Court's cases under

21

Section 1, which say that competition should

22

provide what is the appropriate ratio between

23

these things.

24
25

I'll give you an example.

In the Indiana Dental case, a dentist
refused to provide X-rays to insurers and the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

dentist's argument was that this restriction on

2

the provision of X-rays would improve quality

3

of patient care.

4

The Court rejected that argument.

5

said you cannot restrict competition with

6

respect to that cat -- category because

7

competition should provide what is the

8

appropriate balance between these competing

9

things.

10

That's our central point.

It

Even if

11

this is one market, competition should decide

12

what is the appropriate ratio between merchant

13

fees and cardholder rewards.

14

Amex is perfectly -- we have no

15

problem with Amex's approach of having a high

16

reward/high cost card.

17

they're trying to insulate that product because

18

they think under the full spectrum of

19

competition it could not survive from a

20

competing argument, such as low cost/low reward

21

cards.

The problem is that

22

And so that's simply inconsistent with

23

the basic policies of the Sherman Act, which is

24

that not just price but quality considerations

25

and all other considerations are best satisfied

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

through competition.

2

And I still think that it's

3

fundamentally inconsistent with this Court's

4

rule of reason cases in the vertical context.

5

In -- in the resale price maintenance context,

6

the Court made quite clear that, even though

7

resale price maintenance might lead to higher

8

prices for the higher services being imposed,

9

if consumers didn't like those higher services,

10

they could always switch to cheaper goods, a

11

cheaper manufacturer's good.

12

That is the fundamental problem that

13

we have with this restraint.

14

price maintenance, it has restricted interbrand

15

competition, and so it's affected all

16

competitors, relieving them of the ability to

17

provide the low cost -- low cost product that

18

consumers might want.

So, if there are no further questions,
I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT UNITED STATES IN

3

SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS

4
5

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

6

The purpose and effect of Amex's

7

anti-steering rules is to eliminate price

8

competition across an entire market.

9

Second Circuit held that the plaintiffs had not

10

even established a prima facie case of

11

anticompetitive effect.

Yet the

12

In our view -- our view, the court of

13

appeals made two fundamental errors.

The first

14

was that for purposes of the -- the plaintiff's

15

prima facie case, the court collapsed into one

16

what should have been regarded as distinct

17

markets.

18

analysis, the court should have focused

19

entirely on the effects on the market for

20

provision of network services to merchants.

21

The second and I think perhaps the

And at the first stage of the

22

more fundamental error, and -- and goes to some

23

of the questions that the Court has been

24

asking, is that even when looking at the

25

cardholder side of the market, the Second

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
18
1

Circuit erred by conflating the question, have

2

reward -- have cardholder rewards become more

3

generous, with the appropriate question, has

4

competition on the cardholder side been

5

enhanced?

6

And I'd like to echo one of the things

7

that Mr. Murphy was saying, that from our point

8

of view, it's entirely legitimate for Amex to

9

pursue a strategy where it produces higher

10

rewards for cardholders and charges a premium

11

and it's fully free to attempt to persuade its

12

cardholders that the extra value is worth the

13

extra cost.

14

And in all sorts of markets -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Mr. Stewart, what

16

would you say, though, I mean, you -- you argue

17

to us that this is a very unique situation and

18

new -- new to antitrust law, the two-sided

19

market issue, and assuming all that's true -­

20

I'm not sure it is, but taking it as true -­

21

why shouldn't we take Judge Easterbrook's

22

admonition seriously, that judicial errors are

23

a lot harder to correct than an occasional

24

monopoly where you can hope and assume that the

25

market will eventually correct it.

Judicial

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
19

errors are very difficult to correct.

2

And we've had a long and painful

experience with vertical restraints in this

decades to correct, in Leegin; Albrecht, which

For just these

reasons.

But I think given that

certainly would take the point that the Court

should not speak more broadly than is

20

necessary.

a sort of unified field theorem that would

22

cover all two-sided markets.

approach the -- the case cautiously.

24
25

It shouldn't attempt to articulate

It should

We do think that there are a couple of
principles that the Court can articulate that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
20
1

would be very deeply rooted in precedent and in

2

established ways of looking at the -- at the

3

antitrust world.

4

The -- the first is that for purposes

5

of market definition, for the first step of the

6

analysis, has the defendant impeded competition

8

been defined by reference to substitutability.

9

What alternative sources of goods or services

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Stewart, you

12

admit, as does General Murphy, that at the

13

second stage it's appropriate for the courts to

14

take into account how this all plays out on the

15

cardholder side of the market.

16

MR. STEWART:

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's correct.
If that's the case,

18

why doesn't that enter into the question of how

19

you define the market in the first instance?

20

MR. STEWART:

Well, I think it's -- it

21

would be hard to determine, for instance, or

22

really conceptually impossible determine -- to

23

determine whether Amex had market power in a

24

hypothetical market consisting of both the

25

merchant side and the cardholder side.

that's -- that's where I need help.

2

MR. STEWART:

Well, I think it's -­

3

it's kind of inherent in the -- in the

4

three-step approach that the Court has taken to

5

resolving rule of reason cases where first the

6

plaintiff attempts to establish an

7

anticompetitive effect.

8

attempts to establish a procompetitive

9

justification.

Then the defendant

And then the third step is the

10

plaintiff can show either that the

11

justification could have been achieved in a

12

different way or that it wasn't really

13

necessary.

14

It's inherent in that formula that

15

practices that can ultimately be justified at

16

the second step may still have anticompetitive

17

effects and those can be isolated and analyzed

18

separately from the procompetitive effects.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I can

Okay?

Now there we are.

And I can think of

different uses for the notion that you have two

8

if that's the use, I wonder why they entered

9

into it.

Some people might say that
Ah,

Okay?

saying:

is because it creates a new, wonderful titanium

uranium bolt that never would have been

produced otherwise.

relevant here, at least not yet.

MR. STEWART:

Well, this market is -­

24

and we take the point that's made on -- by some

25

of the briefs on the other side.

This market

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
24
1

is distinct in the sense that at the time that

2

a transaction is accomplished at the -- a

3

merchant location, services are simultaneously

4

being provided both to the merchant and to the

5

cardholder.

6

And that -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

We do the same thing,

don't we, with nuts and bolts?

8

people nuts and we give them bolts.

MR. STEWART:

We give the

But -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

And -- and maybe

11

it -- I mean, you know, there are loads of -­

12

there are a lot of products like that.

13

MR. STEWART:

I -- I guess what I

14

would say from this standpoint is Mr. Murphy,

15

the federal government, and the Respondents all

16

agree that benefits to cardholders should be

17

considered as part of the antitrust analysis.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Should really?

19

Because -- you -- and you agree with that?

20

example, we have an agreement among toy

21

manufacturers that we won't sell poisoned toys.

22

That's always been an absolute mystery to put

23

to the class, from Phil Areeda on, because they

24

want to stop the poisoned toys, but you say,

25

hey, that isn't the job of the antitrust law.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

For

Official
25
1

That's the job of the consumer protection

2

agency.

3

know that that issue had been solved in this

4

Court.

And so we have a debate.

5

MR. STEWART:

And I didn't

No, I -- I take your

6

point, that perhaps I was imprecise when I said

7

benefits to cardholders, because the Court has

8

made clear in different Sherman Act contexts

9

that, in kind of balancing procompetitive and

10

anticompetitive justifications, you're not just

11

looking at anything that could be characterized

12

as beneficial or harmful.

13

harms to or benefits to competition.

14

You're looking at

And our point about the cardholder

15

side is that the Second Circuit may have been

16

right when it said the effect of this -- the

17

anti-steering rules was that, on the whole,

18

cardholder benefits may have become more

19

generous.

20

But the court -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Stewart, could

I just ask you to finish your second response

22

23

was number 1, that was fundamental.

24

second principle that you think is important?

25

And, number 3, borrowing from Justice -- or

You said the market issue
What's the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
26
1

going to Justice Breyer's point, I can -- I

2

understand the argument why in this case on

3

step 1 the two markets should not be joined,

4

but I -- it's possible that in some other

5

two-sided market that it might be a step 1.

6
7
8
9

Do we have to rule and say that in no
market is it?
MR. STEWART:

No -- no.

To take -- to

take that part of the question first, I think

10

the Court should proceed cautiously about

11

announcing categorical rules and can say that,

12

for purposes of this case, it is sufficient

13

to -- the fact that there is four-way

14

competition on the merchant side and

15

thousands-way competition on the cardholder

16

side is by itself a sufficient ground for

17

treating these as distinct markets.

18

But to take the other part of your

19

question and Justice Gorsuch's question, the

20

reason that we think that the court of appeals

21

analyzed benefits to cardholders incorrectly

22

was that it doesn't focus on benefits to

23

competition.

It's one way of trying to

And, similarly, MasterCard and Visa

14

would like to be able -- would like consumers

15

to feel that maybe they're -- if they wanted to

compete on -- on the basis of price, they would

want consumers to feel, yes, maybe the rewards

will not be extensive, but you will get a

discount at the cash register or you will get

That's one question.

23

sometimes learn something, as I just did from

argument.

2

antitrust at a time when people didn't use

3

phrases like platforms and two-sided markets.

4

So I have to translate things into a language

5

that I've been using for 40 years, but okay.

6

And my problem is that I grew up in

So now, as I see your argument, and I

7

-- I didn't -- I started out not seeing what it

8

was -- tell me if I'm right, and don't just

9

agree if I'm not -- I really analogize this to

10

a -- a firm that makes things and sells through

11

dealers.

12

Now it used to be, correct, that you

13

couldn't tell the dealer he had to fix his

14

prices because that stopped intrabrand

15

competition, and you couldn't tell the dealer

16

he had to divide markets.

17

them.

18

You couldn't divide

And that's changed because sometimes

19

those are justified.

20

they are justified is that by fixing the

21

dealer's prices among themselves or giving him

22

exclusive territories, we will encourage him to

23

work harder to sell our brand.

24

sometimes is a justification.

25

And usually the argument

And that

And it seems to me you are simply

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
39
1

making a variation on that theme.

You are

2

saying by engaging in this agreement among

3

dealers, which is, after all, agreement that

4

does not directly but indirectly has a tendency

5

to fix -- to -- to raise prices, therefore, in

6

a sense, there's an anticompetitive aspect.

7

But by doing that -- by doing that, we

8

are better able to get a product through to the

9

consumer that, in fact, they will prefer more.

10

Now have I correctly stated, at least

11

in general terms, the form of your argument?

12

MR. CHESLER:

In general terms, you

13

have, Your Honor.

odd percent of the market -­

-- were required to

19

respond in kind, and the result is that output

20

has increased.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. CHESLER:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Better for everyone.

Output has increased.

2

gizmo car through and that'll improve

3

everybody's life.

4

Okay?

Now, if that's the form of the

5

argument, then isn't the way I -- I can be a

6

little traditional, say step 1, is there an

7

anticompetitive aspect?

8

what is the justification and does it

9

out-balance, et cetera?

10

Then we go to step 2,

Okay.

So far we're at step 1, is there an

11

anticompetitive aspect?

12

seems to me obvious, of course, there is.

13

Well, of course.

It

When you tell the dealer that he can't

14

tell the customer that he's charging a lower

15

price, that's anticompetitive right then and

16

there, and I don't see any other argument.

17

I mean, what it could -- how could

18

that be procompetitive?

19

a justification for it in terms of what you're

2

The product is the transaction.

3

Indeed, the government contended at trial that

4

American Express had 26 percent of the market.

5

That's 26 percent of the dollar volume of

6

transactions.

7

And if I changed Your Honor's

to the product, the transaction, the answer is

absolutely not.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Output of the

22

product has increased, that has so many factors

23

that go into that besides the nature of the -­

24

the particular product, right?

25

I mean, if the economy grows, then the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

output of your product, credit card

transactions, grows, right?

MR. CHESLER:

It -- it could, Your

4

Honor.

5

driving it was the fierce competition that the

6

district court found between the card

7

providers, which was driven by the rewards that

8

Visa and MasterCard were forced to match

9

because of American Express's rewards.

10

But the evidence here was that what was

There could be exogenous reasons why

11

output increases.

But the government's

12

speculation that it had to do with other

13

factors is just that, it's speculation.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

the product, what are you talking about?

16

number of credit card transactions or the

17

dollar volume?

MR. CHESLER:

Dollar volume.

The

And

19

that's what the government and the district

20

court both said was the best metric for the

21

trial.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then what worries me

23

about that, I have just the same -- look, you

24

-- you both have put your finger, it seems to

25

me, on one of the most, as you know, I think,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
43
1

unless it's changed, one of the most difficult

2

problems in antitrust law:

3

market.

4

How to define a

And, by and large, the answer to that

5

differs in -- depending on a lot of different

6

circumstances and what you're up to.

7

with an agreement that has an anticompetitive

8

impact of some kind, it's easier and, you know,

9

you get away from this, if you can identify an

10
11

And so,

anticompetitive impact.
Think of the new gizmo car which has

12

18 dealers.

13

And for analysis purposes, I don't think you

14

have to worry about a market.

15

that fact of exclusive areas stops these

16

dealers from competing with each other.

17

the matter.

18

anticompetitive impact.

19

We give each an exclusive area.

You say, look,

End of

Right then and there you have an

And then we go on to question 2, is it

20

nonetheless worthwhile?

Now maybe you -- I've

21

read the Second Circuit.

22

judges know antitrust law pretty well and so

23

forth and -- -- and -- but I just don't see

24

something that improves on that basic thing.

25

Unless you want to come in and say,

I know some of those

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
44

oh, this had no impact, you know, because he

2

only had 2 percent of the relevant market, in

3

which case why did he enter into it?

4

I mean, I can imagine variations.

5

do you see how I'm thinking?

6

MR. CHESLER:

You know,

But -- but

I do, Your Honor.

And

7

-- and if I may, the point in your

8

hypothetical, which I want to embrace because

9

it really does make the point I'm trying to

10

make, is the product was the new car with these

11

gizmos on it.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

MR. CHESLER:

Yeah.

And you found in your

14

hypothetical, I believe, that there was an

15

anticompetitive effect at the first stage with

16

respect to that product.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

MR. CHESLER:

Uh-huh.

And what I'm here to

19

tell you is, with respect to the product at

20

issue here, which is credit card transactions,

21

the government did not prove that there was an

22

anticompetitive effect because output was up,

23

quality was up, and they didn't prove what the

24

price of that product was.

25

So you couldn't possibly conclude that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

the price was super-competitive.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

Mr. Chesler -­
It may have been

anticompetitive in one way.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

In one way.

Mr. Chelser -­
You cannot get

7

through to the dealer -- to the customer, the

8

fact that these different companies, some

9

charge lower, some charge higher prices.

The

10

product you're buying, some will be lower, some

11

will be higher.

12

--

That is a fairly key element

13

MR. CHESLER:

Which the credit -­

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- which this

15

prevents you from getting through in terms of

16

information to the person who's going to be

17

buying.

18
19

MR. CHESLER:

Respectfully, Your Honor

-­

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. CHESLER:

No?

-- it does not.

The

22

credit card companies are perfectly free, as

23

Justice Gorsuch's questions asked before, to

24

tell the consumers what their charges are.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

But the merchant is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

not.

And, indeed, were we to start down that

2

road and say don't worry when you get a promise

3

among merchants not to tell people what prices

4

are, because, after all, the person who sells

5

through you could always advertise, that, I

6

think, would have a pretty strong

7

anticompetitive impact across the country.

8

MR. CHELSER:

Discover tried it and said I'm just leaving

money on the table because the restrictions are

not just don't tell them the price difference,

14

but don't steer them away from American Express

15

by giving them a better deal in some other way.

16

So you're not talking about a

17

restriction just on what you tell them, but

18

it's a restriction on what you do.

19

anticompetitive effect is broader than just

20

don't talk.

MR. CHESLER:

And so that

No, Your Honor.

In fact

-JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

hard, to have the merchant agree to try to pass

And when I asked the president of
Discover:

What about the millions and millions

10

of merchants in America which do not accept

11

American Express cards and therefore have none

12

of these provisions; have you, in fact, adopted

13

that strategy at those merchants?

14

He said no.

So what we're talking about with

15

respect to Discover is the issue of protecting

16

a particular competitor, not protecting

17

competition.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I don't think that

19

that's right, Mr. Chesler.

I mean, I think

20

that the Discover issue is about protecting

21

low-cost products because the reason that we've

22

-- that we've said vertical restraints are

23

often perfectly fine -- indeed, better for

24

competition -- is because it allows us to have

25

some high-cost products and some low-cost

exactly what the district court found.

16

these are findings of fact about Discover,

17

about the effect of -- of -- of -- of this

anti-steering provision on the actual state of

competition in the market, meaning on the

20

ability of low-cost cards to compete.

21

MR. CHESLER:

I mean,

And that's
And

If I may respond, Your

Honor.
The district court also found that

24

this two-sided market was, as he said,

25

different from virtually all others because

Heritage Reporting Corporation

50
1

here the two sides were inextricably linked and

2

intertwined.

3

And here, Your Honor, I would submit,

the product, which is the transaction, is a

product that has a cost and a price associated

6

with both of the parties to it, the consumer

and the merchant.

So there is a profit

of profit, what mix will go to the consumer,

won't go to the consumer, and the consumer -­

-- will benefit with lower prices.

6

MR. CHESLER:

Your Honor, in fact, as

7

the -- as the court of appeals pointed out, the

8

fact that not every penny of the merchant fee

9

is passed on in rewards to the consumer tells

10

you nothing about the other costs that the card

company is incurring.

12

And the government did not prove what

those costs are.

It could well be that, in

It doesn't know your business model.

19

MR. CHESLER:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If you want to

argue procompetitive effects, you show it.

It's not up to the government to show on a -­

in a different market that there's a benefit

market.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

that, and -- and in response to Justice Breyer,

14

we talked about the fact that the agreement

15

does limit the merchant's ability to do certain

16

things and -- and whether that might meet step

17

1, but I would have thought under -- under

18

Section 1, you might have responded, yes, if

19

there's market power.

20

But market power, absent market power

21

-- an agreement with a merchant to do anything

22

that restricts anything is not in the

23

cognizance of the antitrust laws.

proof, is not -- does not have market power.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So this vertical

restraint had a complete horizontal effect, so

6

it has market power to control the merchant

market.

8
9

MR. CHESLER:

Respectfully, Your

Honor, I don't think that's what happened here.

10

The increases by the card companies were, as

11

the district court found, to fuel the intense

12

competition for cardholders, without whom there

13

will be no transactions.

14

findings are.

That's what the

15

And if prices go up because the costs

16

of providing a competitive option to consumers

17

go up, that's not anticompetitive.

18

procompetitive.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's

On that point, you

20

know, it looks to me like market power is a

21

gremlin that you are going to throw, if we

22

accept that, throw into the -- into the gears

23

of antitrust law as it has been under Section 1

24

across the country, everywhere.

25

I mean, I thought -- and perhaps there

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
55
1

have been changes, but I haven't seen them in

2

this Court -- I thought that if, in fact, three

3

people agree upon their prices, or forget price

4

fixing, three people who are competitors agree

5

that they will have a convention where they

6

will hire Mr. Smith, who will lecture to them

7

about the benefits of all charging the same

8

price, I would have thought you just said

9

that's anticompetitive.

That's

10

anticompetitive.

11

this gizmo called market power, which is a

12

nightmare.

There's no need to look at

Now, if the defendant wants to come

they did it.

talking about a horizontal restraint, which was

what your comment was directed at, I would be

in complete agreement with you, because the

error costs of a horizontal restraint are very

low.

charge more for less.

seen a Section 1 case.

there couldn't be one, but I -- but I am saying

18

I don't think it's a universal requirement.

19

And I think if you have an anticompetitive

20

agreement which looks anticompetitive, seems

21

anticompetitive, et cetera, why go into market

22

power?

23

MR. CHESLER:

Now I'm not saying

Because, Your Honor, in

24

a vertical restraint, as this Court has said

25

repeatedly over the last 40 years, the error

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
57
1

costs are very low, because when a -- when a

2

company, particularly a company without power,

3

imposes a vertical restraint, it is to enhance

4

its ability to compete against other brands.

5

And as Justice Kennedy said in the

6

Brooke case, a price increase in the face of

7

increasing demand tells the trier of fact

8

nothing about whether it's anticompetitive.

9

One needs to determine if excess profits are

10

being extracted, monopoly rents are being

11

extracted.

12

prove what our costs were, let alone our

13

margins.

14

And the plaintiff here didn't even

If this -- if the standard that this

15

Court articulates, Your Honor, is a standard in

16

which a price increase without proof of a

17

restriction of output, without proof of a harm

18

to quality, without proof that excess profits

19

have been extracted, if that's enough to

20

satisfy a prima facie case, then what will

21

happen in the lower courts -- and I speak from

22

42 years of experience of trying antitrust

23

cases -- there will be a wave, a tsunami of

24

false positives in the lower courts.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

I only have 42 years

Heritage Reporting Corporation

of teaching antitrust.

(Laughter.)

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I would say in

4

that -- in that experience, which is not as

5

good as yours, actually, because you actually

6

have practical experience, but it seems to me

7

there have been a lot of cases where you

8

wouldn't -- you would not see price increases,

9

the main one being Alcoa.

It has no price

It was -­

14

MR. CHESLER:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

There it was only

16

market power.

17

that, but that's a different point.

18

I know.

But -­

MR. CHESLER:

You're going to say

I was about to say

19

that's a different point.

20

from someplace at the time.

21

(Laughter.)

22

MR. CHESLER:

I think I heard that

But, Your -- Your Honor,

23

in a vertical restraint case, if output is

24

going up, if costs are going up because they're

25

investing in rewards that are benefitting the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
59
1

consumer, that's the way a competitive market

2

is supposed to act.

3

And all I'm saying to Your Honor is,

4

if the test that this Court articulates is the

5

test that's suggested by the folks to my right,

6

then we are going to have a wave of positives

7

that are false where real competition is taking

8

place because price increases occur for all

9

sorts of reasons, many of which are perfectly

10

benign, which is exactly what happened here

11

with respect to the merchant fees because they

12

were fueling price decreases to the consumers.

13

Every reward, every seat on a plane to

14

Aruba, every ticket to a Billy Joel concert,

15

every cash back reward that's given, is a price

16

discount to the consumer.

17

district court found here is nobody proved to

18

me what that price is for the product at issue.

19

And what the

So the result that we're trying to

20

avoid here is a situation in which a plaintiff

21

can fail to prove what the price of the product

22

is, merely that there's been an increase to

23

part of that price, and that that's enough to

24

satisfy the first leg of the rule of reason.

25

And the burden then falls to the defendant to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
60
1

disprove what the plaintiff has failed to

2

prove.

3

That will create mischief.
Professor Katz, the government's only

4

expert here, from Berkeley, testified that in a

5

two-sided platform, if you don't completely and

6

accurately assess the impact on both sides of

7

the platform, you will get misleading

8

conclusions.

9

And with respect, Your Honor, that's

The transaction in that

16

always start with the same question:

17

the product at issue?

18

What's

The product at issue in Times-Picayune

19

was advertising sales between the advertisers

20

and the newspapers.

21

subscribers to those newspapers, they had

22

nothing to do with that transaction.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

While there were

Oh, yes, they did,

24

because the number of subscribers affected the

25

price that the advertisers were going to use,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

and their inducement to use the -- to subsidize

2

both morning and afternoon advertisements.

3

MR. CHESLER:

And that distinction is

4

exactly why this Court need not decide in this

5

case a rule for all time for every two-sided

6

platform.

7

there is no transaction unless those two

8

parties, the consumer and the merchant, come

9

together at the same moment in time and

11

This case is a situation in which

That was not true in Times-Picayune.

12

Ultimately, over the course of time, if the -­

13

if the advertisers didn't put their ads in the

14

paper, maybe it would have an impact on

15

consumers, and vice versa, but you could have a

16

completed transaction in Times-Picayune without

17

the consumer, the subscriber, being involved in

18

that transaction.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Chesler, I don't

experience, teaching or practicing, but -­

22
23
24
25

MR. CHESLER:

It just requires a

little time, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

So I just think of

this in sort of simple-minded ways.

Here's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1

what the district court found.

2

court found that merchants cannot steer

3

customers to cheaper forms of payment.

4

district court found that all of the credit

5

card firms have consistently raised their

6

prices.

7

The district

The

Even when you look at these two-sided

8

prices, the district court found that these

9

price increases were not being passed on to

10

consumers.

11

it was impossible for a credit card company

12

that wanted to offer a low cost/low price

13

product to enter the market.

14

And the district court found that

So you put all of those things

15

together, that sounds like a market that is not

16

working in the way it's supposed to, at least

17

sufficiently to get on to the second step where

18

you can make all your arguments about why it is

19

that a market where the prices only go up and

20

where no low-price competition can emerge is,

21

nonetheless, a good market.

22

MR. CHESLER:

Your Honor, my answer to

23

that is that every one of those findings dealt

24

only with the merchant relationship.

25

nothing to do with the consumers.

They had

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64
1

And, again, here, without that

2

consumer presenting her card to the merchant,

3

the transactions that were being debated in

4

this case wouldn't even exist.

5

The district court itself found that

6

there was no proof of the actual price to the

7

two sides of that transaction.

8
9

The government had failed to prove
that.

The government had failed to prove what

10

the costs were for the -- for the services

11

provided to the merchant, and it failed to

12

prove what the -- what the consumer's side of

13

the price was.

14

So every -- we didn't challenge any of

15

those findings in the court of appeals, nor do

16

we challenge them here, because they are all

17

clapping with one hand.

18

about what happens on one side of the counter

19

when you present your card for that -- to buy

20

that sweater.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

They're only talking

Well, it's the one

22

hand where the government has the burden.

23

now, if you want to come in and you can say,

24

look, there are all these great benefits that

25

go beyond -- I mean, some of your benefits sort

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official

of seem to me to be benefits for American

2

Express only.

3

But if you want to say, no, that there

4

are great benefits for the market generally,

5

that's what step 2 is about.

6

MR. CHESLER:

May I?

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

MR. CHESLER:

Please.

You only get to step 2,

9

respectfully, Your Honor, if the government

10

proves that competition for the product has

11

been impaired at step 1.

12

And what I've said over and over again

13

here is the product is the transaction, and

14

none of those findings related to the

15

transaction.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC E. MURPHY

22

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS AND

23

THE STATE RESPONDENTS IN SUPPORT

24
25

MR. MURPHY:

Mr. Chief Justice, just a

few points in rebuttal.

The first of those is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
66
1

I think the most important point for this Court

2

to take from this case is that certainly the

3

Court has lessened the scrutiny with respect to

4

vertical restraints in recent -- recent years,

5

but this particular vertical restraint, the one

6

at issue here, has the same effects that we

7

would anticipate happening with a horizontal

8

cartel.

9

If all of the credit card companies

10

got together and said we're going to not allow

11

steering, that would cut off price competition

12

on the merchant side, it would still allow for

13

quality reward competition on the other side,

14

but that rule would be per se illegal.

15

That rule would be per se illegal,

16

despite the alleged benefits on the cardholder

17

side, just as this Court said in the engineers'

18

case, the engineers can't get together, fix

19

prices, and then justify that on the basis of

20

the allegedly improved quality.

21

illegal.

22

It's per se

We're not in the per se illegal world

23

here because this is a rule of reason case, but

24

what the evidence shows under the rule of

25

reason, the full market analysis, is that it

Is that what you're -­

MR. MURPHY:

Absolutely.

Just to

13

answer the question presented, which was

14

whether the government met its prima facie case

15

based on the effects that we showed at the

16

trial.

17

preserve -- any -- any arguments that they have

18

preserved, they can present to the Second

19

Circuit.

And then, on -- on remand, they can

And then, with respect to price, we -­

21

we would readily agree that higher price can

22

oftentimes arise from different reasons.

23

That's why the Court in Brooke Group said that

the government should prove that the higher

25

prices arise from non-market forces.

it need be shown?

6

MR. MURPHY:

Yes.

So we showed market

7

power, but we showed it quite powerfully in

8

this case with this restraint affecting

9

merchants making up some 90 percent of the

10

market.

And nobody without market power could

11

actually affect industry-wide prices, and

that's what -­

MR. MURPHY:
