CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

versus Lamone.

Mr. Kimberly.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL B. KIMBERLY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

9
10
11

MR. KIMBERLY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
All nine justices in Vieth against

12

Jubelirer agreed that partisan gerrymandering

13

can violate the Constitution.

14

question presented in this case is whether this

15

Court has the Article III authority to do

16

anything about it.

17

The principal

We submit that it does under the First

18

Amendment.

19

Amendment retaliation and ballot access cases,

20

government officials may not single out

21

particular individuals for disfavored treatment

22

on the basis of the views that they have

23

expressed at the ballot box in prior elections.

24
25

According to this Court's First

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Kimberly, may I

ask you a kind of preliminary question?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I -- I

Official
4
1

take it it's -- it's much too late, even if you

2

were successful, for there to be any change for

3

the 2018 election, and if that's so -- and

4

we're only talking about a preliminary

5

injunction here, right?

6

MR. KIMBERLY:

We are talking about a

7

preliminary injunction, Your Honor.

8

correct.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's

So how would you be

10

irreparably injured by the denial of a

11

preliminary injunction if the earliest that -­

12

assuming you're right, that a redistricting

13

could go into effect would be 2020?

14

MR. KIMBERLY:

Well, Your Honor, we

15

don't concede for purposes of this appeal that

16

it's too late to enter relief in time for the

17

2018 election.

18

that deals with these sorts of circumstances

19

that this Court addressed in Bush against -­

20

I'm sorry -- not Bush against Vera, but the

21

statute is 2 U.S.C. 2a(c) -­

22

Congress has enacted a statute

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is there anything in

23

the record to indicate that experts will tell

24

you, oh, this is -- this is possible?

25

MR. KIMBERLY:

It's -­

That it's possible to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

enact a new -­

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That it's possible

3

to comply with the injunction in time for the

4

2018 election.

5

MR. KIMBERLY:

There's nothing in the

6

record about that, Your Honor, but that also

7

isn't an issue that the district court has been

8

in -- given an opportunity to address yet.

9
10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but you're

asking us to then just -- just assume it.

11

MR. KIMBERLY:

Well, as a matter of

12

fact, Your Honor, I think what we're asking for

13

is just a remand for reconsideration of the

14

preliminary injunction motion in light of what

15

we take to be the proper legal standards.

16

so, if our -­

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And

Given the

18

equitable principles involved in an injunction,

19

this is -- you waited an awfully long time to

20

bring this suit from the change in 2011, was

21

it?

22

of whether to uphold or not uphold your

23

request?

24
25

Should that factor into our consideration

MR. KIMBERLY:

So I think there are

two things to say about that, Your Honor.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

The

Official
6
1

first is we don't think that that is an issue

2

that's really properly before this Court,

3

unless this Court concluded that it would be an

4

abuse of discretion not to deny the preliminary

5

injunction on that basis.

6

of the abuse of discretion standard of -- of

7

review and the fact that the lower court hasn't

8

had an opportunity yet to address that

9

question.

10
11

JUSTICE ALITO:

That is a function

But I don't think you

finished -­

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it's not

13

-- it's not just that equitable factor.

There

14

are other factors under the preliminary

15

injunction standard, including irreparable

16

harm.

17

have been held under this district in 2012,

18

2014, and 2016.

And because of your delay, elections

Right?

19

MR. KIMBERLY:

Well, I -­

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

MR. KIMBERLY:

Is -- is it -­

It is true that those

22

elections have been held.

23

it's attributable to our delay in bringing the

24

suit.

25

I would not say that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, no, but

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

it is evidence of the -- the question of

2

whether you've been irreparably harmed, that

3

you've been willing to let go.

4

in 2012, 2014, and 2016, suggest that maybe

5

2018, you're not going to be irreparably harmed

6

in a broader sense.

7

would be in this particular election, but if

8

you've been willing to accept that harm in

9

three different cycles, I don't know if we

The elections

Obviously, you argue you

10

should get concerned about irreparable harm for

11

one more.

12

MR. KIMBERLY:

Well, I -- I guess I

13

have a few things to say about that.

14

is this lawsuit was initially filed in 2013.

15

True, after one election had taken place, but

16

district courts have entered injunctions

17

against the enforcement of congressional

18

districting maps after elections have taken

19

place many times in the past.

20

The first

So -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, if you

21

look at 20 -- you -- you did not file the suit

22

presenting this particular theory of the case

23

until 2016.

24
25

MR. KIMBERLY:

No, our -- our position

is that this theory of the case has been in the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
8
1

case from the beginning.

2

this Court's reversal and remand of the Fourth

3

Circuit back in 2015 in Shapiro against

4

McManus, that this claim was in the case, that

5

it was a claim that had not yet been foreclosed

6

by any majority opinion of this Court, and,

7

therefore, that it was a basis for convening a

8

three-judge district court.

9

This was a premise of

It's true that it did not claim a

10

majority of the attention of the original

11

complaint, but there is -- this Court could not

12

have reached the decision that it reached in

13

Shapiro against McManus if this claim had not

14

been in the case from the get-go, which is -­

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

I still don't

16

understand what you want to have take place for

17

-- in practical -- in practical terms.

18

want this case remanded to the district court

19

and you think that after the case is -- we

20

remand the case to the district court, there

21

will be time to adopt a new map to be used in

22

the 2018 election?

23

MR. KIMBERLY:

You

Your Honor, I -- I -­

24

the -- the short answer to that question is

25

that that is an issue for the district court to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

decide.

2

have conceded, and I think it -- it's

3

conceivable that the case could get back down

4

to the district court in time for some form of

5

relief.

6

conclude that there isn't enough time and allow

7

an election to take place under the map as it's

8

drawn.

9

solution under 2 U.S.C. 2a(c).

10
11

It is, as I say, not something that we

Certainly, the district court could

It might look for some sort of interim

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What would

that -- what would that -­

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but if it was

13

ordered by this Court -- an order by this Court

14

indicating, oh, there might be time, is going

15

to upset settled expectations.

16

there's -- people are planning campaigns and so

17

forth.

18

suggesting that it would not be disruptive of

19

the current election scheme in the current

20

election districting for this -- for this Court

21

to remand to consider whether the map should be

22

changed at this late date?

23

There's -­

It would be highly -- you're -- are you

MR. KIMBERLY:

Well, I -- I think it

24

would perpetuate the same sort of uncertainty,

25

frankly, that's been hanging over Maryland

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

politics from the pendency of this suit all

2

along.

3

I don't think this Court has to actually take a

4

position on -- on the time in question one way

5

or another.

6

is evaluate the legal principles that the

7

district court announced in its decision

8

denying our preliminary injunction motion, to

9

correct them if it sees fit to correct them, or

10
11
12
13

I -- I don't deny that, Your Honor, but

What we're asking this Court to do

to affirm them otherwise.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Let me ask you a

question -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it's not

14

simply a question of -- we have held that, in a

15

preliminary injunction context, you do not have

16

to consider the merits if you think the

17

equities and the irreparable harm questions cut

18

against the grant of a preliminary injunction.

19

MR. KIMBERLY:

Well, that's true, but,

20

again, that would be a question, I think, for

21

the district court in the first instance.

22

question whether or not -­

23
24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no, you're

asking us to -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The

Right.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
11
1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- decide the

2

merits and determine from that whether there's

3

been an abuse of discretion.

4

that.

I understand

5

MR. KIMBERLY:

Right.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And what I'm

7

suggesting, most -- I guess the strongest case

8

is the Winter case from a few years ago, where

9

we said if the equities and the harm question

10

cuts strongly in one direction, we don't have

11

to consider the merits at all without

12

determining that there has or hasn't been an

13

abuse of discretion.

14

MR. KIMBERLY:

Well, I'm -- I don't

15

recall what it is exactly the district court in

16

the Winter case -- with which I'm familiar,

17

before this Court, I don't recall what the

18

district court in that case had done.

19

If -- if the district court had

20

reached each of the individual issues, surely,

21

the Court can pick out among the issues that

22

the district court resolved which it wants to

23

base its decision on.

24

--

25

And surely that doesn't

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I think

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1

that's exactly -- I think that's exactly right,

2

that the Court can pick out of the different

3

criteria which one it wants to base its

4

decision on.

5

challenge today to explain to us why we should

6

pick out the hardest one.

7

And I think it's part of your

MR. KIMBERLY:

Well, and -- and the

8

short answer is because that's the one on which

9

the district court based its decision.

If this

10

Court were instead to pick out a different

11

factor from the preliminary injunction test and

12

decide that it wants to affirm on that basis,

13

it would basically be taking the discretion of

14

the district court and -- and taking it for

15

itself to exercise.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Let me ask you a

17

practical question.

18

preliminary injunction.

19

merits trial to go through or not?

20
21
22

This is a denial of a

MR. KIMBERLY:
do.

You still have a

That also -- yes.

We

Yes, unless there's a summary -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now can you go

23

through that trial without a ruling from us?

24

And, if not, why not?

25

Judge Niemeyer said that there were

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1

many open issues in this case, not the least of

2

which was the motivation of the -- of the

3

Governor and his committee for the change at

4

issue.

5

Would that obviate some of the merits

6

questions that are before us if you don't prove

7

that first prong?

8

evidence to -- to show that.

9

MR. KIMBERLY:

10
11

You have fairly strong

Is -- is -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is your weakness

in the other prongs?

12

MR. KIMBERLY:

Well, we don't think we

13

have weakness in any of the prongs,

14

respectfully, Your Honor.

15
16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, assuming we

accept your test.

17

(Laughter.)

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I agree.

But

19

assuming we -- we leave it the way it is, what

20

happens?

21

MR. KIMBERLY:

Well, I -- I think what

22

-- the concern that we have is if the -- if the

23

case -- so imagine the district court does not

24

enter summary judgment, and the case proceeds

25

to trial.

It will proceed to trial on what we

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

take to be a fundamentally misguided view of

2

what we have to prove to establish a First

3

Amendment violet -- violation against partisan

4

gerrymandering.

5

What the district court indicated at

6

the preliminary injunction hearing is that it

7

would be open to reopening discovery, allowing

8

us basically to conduct a massive district-wide

9

survey of voters to determine whether or not

10

they would have voted one way or another.

11

All because the district court

12

believed that the -- the primary question on

13

burden is whether all of the electoral outcomes

14

in the district under the map are attributable

15

to that.

16
17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There's been a lot

of -­

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, let me ask you

19

about your -- your legal theory then because I

20

-- I probably don't understand it.

21

understand it, I really don't see how any

22

legislature will ever be able to redistrict.

23

But, if I

So let's say that a legislature is

24

drawing a particular map or a particular

25

district.

Let's say it's a map and they say

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

that -- and they have two possible plans that

2

they're considering.

3

low population deviations, exactly the same.

4

The districts in both are compact.

5

territory is contiguous.

6

And they both have very

The

But they say, look, did -- plan A

7

gives our party a more than de minimis

8

advantage and plan B gives the other party a

9

more than de minimis advantage.

10
11
12
13

So let's pick

the one that favors our party.
Now, in your view, that's
unconstitutional, I gather?
MR. KIMBERLY:

Well, if -- if what the

14

map drawers are doing is looking at the way

15

that individuals have voted in the past and on

16

that basis attempting to make it more difficult

17

for them to achieve electoral success moving

18

forward, that is the specific intent and there

19

is a burden imposed as a consequence -­

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

21

MR. KIMBERLY:

22
23
24
25

Yes.
-- it -- it -- it may

well be that -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

The answer to my

question is yes?
MR. KIMBERLY:

It -- it may well be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1
2

that that would be a violation.
JUSTICE ALITO:

But hasn't this Court

3

said time and again you can't take all

4

consideration of partisan advantage out of the

5

district -- districting?

6

MR. KIMBERLY:

I -- I want to be very

7

clear that our theory does not require taking

8

all partisan advantage -- consideration of

9

partisan advantage -­

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I don't see how

11

your theory is any different from that, other

12

than -- than a de minimis partisan advantage.

13

MR. KIMBERLY:

So there are -- there

14

are two ways in which it's different.

15

first is there are a range of considerations

16

that map drawers will take into account that

17

bear on the question of partisan advantage.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

The

Yeah, I know.

You

19

have, you know, protection of incumbents and

20

preserving a district that has a particular

21

facility in it and a few other things.

22

In my example, none of those apply.

23

Okay.

Your answer is that favoring the

24

political party of the majority in the

25

legislature in a way that's more than de

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1

minimis is a violation of the Constitution?

2

MR. KIMBERLY:

In -- in two

3

consequences, that -- in two circumstances,

4

that wouldn't be the case.

5

also take the position that strict scrutiny

6

applies.

7

map drawers could consider this sort of

8

information if it's narrowly tailored to a

9

compelling governmental interest, which might

10

include, for example, pursuing a balanced map

11

or pursuing competitive districts.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So the first is we

And so it certainly is the case that

Well, what -- what

13

would happen if you have the orange party and

14

the green party, the green party's in the

15

minority, orange with 45 and -- orange party

16

55.

17

or building new plants and so forth, it

18

switches.

19

Then, because of natural population shifts

Could the legislature say at this

20

point we -- we want, in order to have a

21

congressionally balanced declaration -­

22

delegation, change -- change the districting in

23

-- in order to accommodate the new majority?

24

MR. KIMBERLY:

I -- it -- it -­

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It seems to me that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
18

that would be definitely to retaliate against

2

certain -- a certain voter.

orange -- for the orange party who used to be

4

in the majority is now in the minority.

got a complaint under your view?

6

MR. KIMBERLY:

The voter for the

He's

Well, unless, as Your

7

Honor suggested, it's in pursuit of -- of

8

balanced map drawing.

9

circumstance we've taken the position

10

I think in that

throughout this litigation that -­

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But is your theory

12

that that would be a compelling interest that

13

could defeat strict scrutiny?

14

the way I understand your theory is that you

15

would put the state in that position to the

16

test of -- of saying this is a compelling

17

interest, this is the only way we can achieve

18

that interest, and -- and sort of put it

19

through the strict scrutiny hoops, even when

20

the state, you know, wants to achieve balanced

21

districts or wants to undo a former

22

gerrymander, so you would still put the state

23

through a very strict scrutiny test in that

24

case?

25

MR. KIMBERLY:

In other words,

Well, I -- I -- I think

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
19
1

the answer is yes, Your Honor, but I -- I think

2

in this circumstance strict scrutiny could do

3

real work, just as this Court in the racial

4

gerrymandering context has generally tolerated

5

the idea, the consideration of race is a

6

compelling -- is -- is a necessary means of

7

achieving the compelling end of complying with

8

Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act for -­

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, how

10

would you ever satisfy strict scrutiny in -- in

11

a case like this?

12

seem to me that there are so many alternative

13

approaches that the idea of saying this one way

14

of achieving a particular result was the only

15

possible way.

16

In other words, it would

MR. KIMBERLY:

I -- I don't -- I don't

17

think, under the strict scrutiny approach, I

18

don't think it's -- it's necessarily that that

19

particular district as it's drawn is what would

20

have to be necessary.

21

I think, for example, in Arizona, the

22

independent redistricting commission there is

23

told to pursue competitive districts.

24

to pursue competitive districts, it's -- it's

25

-- it's likely, I think, that considering this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

In order

Official
20
1

kind of data is necessary.

2

So -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But, I mean,

3

your theory is that the legislature acts with a

4

vengeful intent to punish people for the

5

exercise of their First Amendment rights,

6

right?

7
8
9

MR. KIMBERLY:

The way we put it is

disapproval of their past voting history, yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And they're

10

going to say that in some circumstances that's

11

going to be okay, even though it applies strict

12

scrutiny, it's going to be okay for them to

13

burden their First Amendment rights?

14

MR. KIMBERLY:

Well, I -- I think we

15

would take the position, just as in any other

16

First Amendment context that, yes, if

17

consideration of past voting history is

18

necessary to pursue that compelling

19

governmental interest, we tend to think that

20

balanced maps and competitive districts would

21

fit that hole.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But when you start

23

-- when you start with a district that's been

24

skewed and you take that as the baseline and

25

say any deviation from that skewed districting

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
21
1

has to get strict scrutiny, there's something

2

wrong with that.

3

I mean, isn't the state able to say in

4

the past this was a gerrymandered district and

5

now we want to undo the gerrymander, and then

6

people who are left out will say:

7

been diluted, we've -- we've lost the clout

8

that we once had.

9

Now we've

I mean, isn't there something wrong

10

with using the district as it now exists as

11

your starting point?

12

MR. KIMBERLY:

I think there are three

13

things to say about that, Your Honor.

14

recognize that this is an important point in

15

the case, so I'd like to be sure to hit all

16

three.

17

And I

The first is our focus on the

18

immediately prior -- the form of the

19

immediately prior district was a reflection of

20

what this Court said in Karcher against Daggett

21

about districts historically having a -- a core

22

around which changes are made.

23

That accurately describes the Sixth

24

Congressional District, which historically has

25

comprised northwest Maryland and around which

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
22
1

changes have been made, but that historical

2

core has been preserved.

3

I think probably analytically the more

4

consistent way to think about it is the first

5

precondition under the Gingles framework for

6

approaching racial vote dilution, which is the

7

question whether the targeted minority is

8

capable of forming -- is -- is sufficiently

9

numerous and geographically compact to form a

10
11

majority of a reasonably drawn district.
We knew in this case that that was

12

true because, of course, between 1990 and 2010,

13

Republican voters had formed the majority of a

14

reasonably drawn district.

15

case we had focused on the way that it had been

16

drawn before.

17

That's why in this

But in a circumstance where the Court

18

is looking at whether there has been a

19

maintenance of a prior gerrymander, we think

20

probably the -- the more consistent way to look

21

at it doctrinally and analytically is -- is as

22

I just described under the first prong of the

23

the Sixth District and not the map as a whole,

11

that it just wasn't an apt way of thinking

12

about what happened in Maryland.

13

It was our understanding when we

The second reason that we focused on

14

it is because we were concerned about the

15

notion that -- under these other tests, that

the injury that was inflicted upon Republican

voters in Maryland's Sixth Congressional

District could be viewed as being offset by -­

by allowing effectively gerrymandering other

cases.

about them all together because I think the

consequences of not adopting one or the other

theory is -- is alarming and ought to be

alarming to anybody.

I do think it makes sense to think

I might add that I think today, as the

17

Campaign Legal Center laid out in its brief in

18

this case, a challenge to Maryland's partisan

19

gerrymander in 2011 would likely succeed under

20

the approach that they've taken.

Conversely, I think the Wisconsin map

could be invalidated under our approach.

would require a different theory and different

ones for different variations and, you know,

that's -- maybe there are different parts of

to meet a strict scrutiny burden on that,

again, depending on the strict scrutiny

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Counsel, one

16

question I have about causation for you.

17

Before the district court, it appeared that you

18

conceded that you had to prove but-for

19

causation, that but for the alleged

20

gerrymander, the outcome would have been

21

different in these last three elections.

22

the district court expressly rejected a lower

23

standard, rejecting some metaphysical could-be

24

burden in favor of the but-for cause test.

25

In this Court, you seem to now be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

backing away from the but-for cause

2

requirement, as best I can tell, in favor of

3

something the district court might have

4

described differently.

5

And I wonder how could it be an abuse

6

of discretion for the district court to have

7

proceeded on the basis of a concession before

8

it that you're now backing away from?

9

MR. KIMBERLY:

Well, to be clear, we

10

-- we believe that but-for causation is an

11

element of the claim.

ours to prove.

We just don't think it's

18

MR. KIMBERLY:

According to -- your

point.

How can

it be an abuse of discretion for the district

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Because that -- I mean,

context, as I say, to mean something other than

5

what it meant.

6

It's taken out of

But I -- I think it's wrong to say

7

that that is -- that that is the basis on which

8

the district court based its decision.

9

based its decision on the view that, in order

10

to prove an actionable burden in any partisan

11

gerrymandering case, the plaintiffs have to

12

come forward and show that electoral outcomes

13

have been changed in the past and will continue

14

to be changed until the map is altered.

15

that is not what this Court -- that is not a

16

position that we took in the district court.

17

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

It

And

One more along these

18

lines for you.

In Factual Findings 11 and 12,

19

the district court found that plaintiffs had -­

20

had conducted no statistical sampling to show

21

an alternative cause might not have been

22

responsible; namely, that people just preferred

23

the candidate.

24

MR. KIMBERLY:

Right.

25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And it had nothing

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

to do with gerrymandering.

2

we address that factual finding and call it an

3

abuse of discretion, the decision here, when

4

plaintiffs failed to rule out other potential

5

causal factors for the results here?

6

MR. KIMBERLY:

How do we -- how do

Well, there are two

7

things to say about that.

The first and, I

8

think, the easiest way to address it is through

9

the legal question of whether Mt. Healthy

10

burden-shifting applies here, whether it's on

11

the state, when a prima facie case of

12

discrimination has been made, to come forward

13

with neutral justifications for the action that

14

it took.

15

If we're right about that question,

16

then it wasn't our burden to put that evidence

17

before the Court in any event.

18

other way to think about it, to call it abuse

19

of -- of discretion is, frankly, because it's

20

clear error.

21

But I think the

The court didn't take account of the

22

strong evidence that we have about the

23

reliability of the metrics that the map drawers

24

themselves used to work the gerrymander in this

25

case.

That includes the PVI and the -- well,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
36
1

the map drawers didn't rely on the PVI, but

2

they relied on the DPI.

3

We have evidence uncontested in this

4

case that those metrics are reliable ways of

5

predicting electoral outcomes.

6

That they are reliable is a premise of

7

partisan gerrymandering to begin with.

8

weren't reliable, we wouldn't see partisan

9

gerrymandering at all because it would be a

10

fool's errand.

11

case.

12

If they

We know that not to be the

We have strong evidence in the case

13

demonstrating that, more likely than not, the

14

electoral outcomes and the dilution of votes in

15

the district was attributable, as common sense

16

suggests, to the way that the -- the map

17

drawers drew the lines.

18

And so I think you have the legal

19

error under Mt. Healthy burden-shifting, and,

20

as to the factual question, it's simply a -- a

21

-- a -- a clear misreading of the record before

22

the district court.

23

If I may reserve my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN M. SULLIVAN
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. SULLIVAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The plaintiffs' First Amendment

7

retaliation claim fails to -- to provide a

8

manageable standard for evaluating partisan

9

gerrymandering for three principal reasons.

10

First Amendment retaliation does not

11

even try to answer the perennial question of

how much is too much politics in a

redistricting process that this Court has

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, how much is

too much is when, I think, balled up in the

23

question of which there -- I -- I grant you

24

they're a little bit equivocal of who bears

25

this burden, but they're -- they are saying

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
39

that we have to show that there's some form of

entrenchment, that the intent is to ensure that

3

only Democrats will be capable of winning in

4

this district for the life of the census or the

5

life of this boundary.

form of too much.
MR. SULLIVAN:

But they -- but they're

really relying on is the intent, which they

would equate with retaliation.

11

same intent which the Court recognized in

12

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But it's the

Well, Mr. Sullivan,

14

let's say you're right, that they have not

shown us how much is too much, that they have

16

suggested that in any forum, when there's

17

partisan advantage, the courts should be

18

intervening.

20

like that to deal with this case because,

Sotomayor said, you know, from the Governor,

2

from Congressman Hoyer, people were very

3

upfront about what they were trying to do here,

which was to create another Democratic

district.

6

people had to be removed from this district as

7

a result of one person/one vote.

And they did that.

Only 10,000

What -- what the Maryland legislature
did was to shuffle 360,000 people out and bring

10

in 350,000 people.

11

the district went from 47 percent Republican

12

and 36 percent Democratic to exactly the

13

opposite, 45 percent Democratic and 34 percent

14

Republican.

15
16

The result of that is that

I mean, how much more evidence of
partisan intent could we need?

Well, Cook evaluated

the first election after the redistricting,

which is the most important one where you can

judge the effectiveness of it.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, Democrats have

6

now prevailed in three straight elections,

7

including in an election which was a wave

8

Republican election.

9

So the effects were exactly what the

10

intent would suggest:

11

Republican incumbent is unseated by a

12

Democratic newcomer, who withstands a wave

13

election, who prevails three straight times.

14

A long-standing

I mean, it appears that the Maryland

15

legislature got exactly what it intended, which

16

was you took a Republican district, like a safe

17

Republican district, and made it into not the

18

safest of Democratic districts but a pretty

19

safe one.

20

MR. SULLIVAN:

Well, no, it's not

safe.

It was judged competitive.

And in that

seems to me -- I've read a lot in the record -­

but worried about, you know, going over

6

Chesapeake Bay and drawing a district, and that

makes a lot of sense, but it's not just water

8

that separates -­

9

MR. SULLIVAN:

10

Right.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- people, and

11

-- and part of the objection here to the way it

12

was redrawn is that it's -- it doesn't seem to

13

have any internal logic.

14

MR. SULLIVAN:

Well, it would be

15

harder to justify the -- what the plaintiffs

16

want to call the benchmark district, which

17

extended the Sixth all the way across the state

18

to far Harford County, which is as far from

19

western Maryland as you can get without

20

plopping into the Chesapeake Bay.

21

So, if you want to say let's judge it

22

by geographic and traditional methods, then you

23

couldn't justify the benchmark district that

24

plaintiffs want to point to, which is the old

25

Sixth.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Sullivan, in

seems to me that what we have here is

11

"max-Democratic."

12

good, why should "max-Democratic" be okay?

13

And if "max-black" was no

MR. SULLIVAN:

There's a couple of

14

reasons.

15

it's -- there's uncontested evidence in the

16

record that the legislators could have, without

17

much difficulty, drawn a map that would have

18

resulted in eight Democratic and zero

it's not a "max-Dem" plan.

One is factual, that on this record,

So, factually,

Secondly, in the other case, I believe

you're concerned about racial gerrymandering,

something that Republicans can hardly claim,

As a general

matter in partisan gerrymandering cases, do you

supposed to take independent voters into

account?

15

MR. SULLIVAN:

Well, I think they have

rights too, and I think what gets lost in -­

you know, people who call themselves

pretty consistently one way.

14

And this is why when mapmakers do

their mapmaking, they look not only to party

Let's suppose that you do have

5

100 percent district drawn to help the

6

Democrats, and suppose also in the next

7

election the Democrat was elected, not the

8

Republican.

9

Now, if you said that was

10

unconstitutional, and there's no other reason

11

given, all right, now, in other words, extreme.

12

If that's the holding of the court -- I'm not

13

saying it would be, I'm just saying assume

14

it -- how would that hurt independents?

15

there a way that would hurt independent voters?

16

That holding.

17

MR. SULLIVAN:

Is

Well, if independent

18

voters had support of that Democratic candidate

19

on the merits of that candidate because they

20

thought that candidate was the better

21

candidate, as happened in the Sixth District

22

when independent voters voted very heavily for

23

the Democratic candidate, then you would be

24

harming them if you were -- if you were -- I

25

don't know if you were going to think about

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

invalidating an election, which the Court

2

hasn't tended to do, but it -- it would be

3

hurting them as well and blaming them for a

4

problem that they didn't create.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We have found

7

burden of treating different political parties

And we've said in those situations we

20

this one?

21

Are you just merely suggesting it

Is that your only

Or is it -- what exactly makes it

MR. SULLIVAN:

Well, there's two parts

22

of that, Your Honor, if you -- if I may.

23

is if we're looking at retaliation, which has

24

never been used as a means of testing a

25

statute, it's been used in the executive part

Heritage Reporting Corporation

of the government when it's employing people,

2

when it's contracting, where speech -- where

3

the government's consideration of protected

speech and political affiliation is generally

5

restricted; whereas when government enacts a

6

redistricting statute, it's legislating, which

7

always involves consideration of speech,

8

including, of course, political speech.

9

But if you're talking about more

go up to the point of voting.

that I am being discriminated against or at

10

views I have expressed over time, and that

those views want to be silenced by the other

side.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And this Court

Are you

essentially saying -- are you agreeing that

gerrymandering is not justiciable?

The court there seemed to agree, certainly the

MR. SULLIVAN:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They've got -­
-- whether there

6

really was any legislative intent outside of

7

the gerrymandering.

8
9

MR. SULLIVAN:

They don't have

anywhere near the number of affidavits they

10

would need from the legislators that actually

11

voted or from the more than 1.5 million

12

Marylanders who approved the plan in a

13

referendum.

14

That's the kind of diffuse intent that

15

comes into play when you're talking about

16

legislation and, here, legislation that's been

17

taken to referendum.

18

from the kind of cases that the district court

19

was citing where you have an employer and you

20

know, you know, I fired this employee, it's not

21

very complex to figure out what the intent was

22

and who did what to whom.

It's so far different

In the racial

that we look to what legislators say.

to what mapmakers say.

pieces of circumstantial evidence about how the

districting turned out, about what was done.

9

We look

We look to a variety of

And the reason I say it's harder there

10

than it is here is because there we have to

politics.

14

is it, except about politics?

15

But here, when you look at this kind

And we would look to the exact same

16

things that we look to in our consistent line

17

of racial gerrymandering cases.

18

MR. SULLIVAN:

Well, I would refer you

19

to plaintiffs' expert -- if you want to say

20

that this is not involving the interplay

21

between race and politics, you should look at

22

the expert report in the record from

23

plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Morrison, who talks

24

about one of the reasons that the plaintiffs

25

are aggrieved is because of the make-up of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
66
1

prior district was much less diverse racially

2

and ethnically than the new district, and they

3

are being forced to be part of a district with

4

a more diverse population in Montgomery County.

5

7

So I don't know if you can say that
this case -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think my main point

8

was that we just -- we do this, we -- we -- we

9

-- we do it when we deal with racial

10

gerrymandering cases, even if you want to say

11

to me that this is no easier than that, I would

12

say back -- I guess I would argue with that,

13

but -- but my main point was even if it's no

14

easier, we do it all the time.

15

MR. SULLIVAN:

But you do it under the

16

Equal Protection Clause and not the First

17

Amendment.

18

will tell you to go.

19

That's where your -- your cases

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, we -- we would

20

be looking at the same things.

We would be

21

looking at the same kind of direct evidence,

22

the same kind of statements.

23

looking at the same circumstantial evidence

24

that has to do with where the lines were drawn

25

and how they were drawn.

We would be

So it's -- it's all

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
67
1

the same kind of evidence, isn't it?

2

MR. SULLIVAN:

No.

When you get to

3

the end of the process, there needs to be a

4

showing of totality of circumstances with

5

historical and sociological evidence of

6

exclusion of that minority, which simply is not

7

the case when you're talking about Republicans.

8
9

They have -- they're a major party.
They've been in control of government

10

oftentimes, and as they are now.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess -- I guess

12

what I was suggesting was that we're looking to

13

the same things to discover intent in each

14

circumstance.

15

MR. SULLIVAN:

You -- you may be

16

looking at similar types of evidence, but as

17

far as I know, you have not applied the First

18

Amendment retaliation rubric to that analysis,

19

as plaintiffs want you to do here.

20
21
22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there anything

-CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, one

23

difference between -- one difference between

24

the race and partisanship is that we've always

25

recognized that a certain degree of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

partisanship is acceptable.

2

recognized that a certain degree of racial

3

discrimination is acceptable.

6

racial segregation law, where the Court has

7

said you need to remove all vestiges, root and

9

redistricting is root and branch political.

This Court said in Vieth that

plaintiffs have not presented the Court with a

test that gives you that line.

JUSTICE BREYER:

We've had briefs in

19

other cases that do try to answer that question

20

pretty directly.

partisanship, ask the defendant.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL B. KIMBERLY

3

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

4

MR. KIMBERLY:

I'd like to come back

5

to something that Justice Kagan raised about

6

intent.

7

The fact is, when it comes to

8

legislative intent, this Court does it.

When

9

it comes to the question of burdens imposed on

10

voting -- voting rights in the ballot access

11

cases, this Court does that as well.

12

Our position is that the -- the burden

13

properly understood under the First Amendment

14

and applied in this context is the same burden

15

that this Court has recognized in the ballot

16

access cases.

17

difficult -- deliberately making it more

18

difficult for particular citizens to achieve

19

electoral success because their views are

20

disapproved by those in power, in this case, in

21

Annapolis.

22

It's -- it's making it more

The Court, having postponed

23

jurisdiction, I think the question of

24

justiciability is squarely presented to it.

25

understand that the Court has some concerns

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I

Official
71
1

about the posture of the case coming up as a

2

preliminary injunction.

3

At the same time, I think the lower

4

court is looking for this Court's guidance on

5

whether the sort of approach that we proposed

6

here is justiciable, and it's one that the

7

Court should proceed on.

8
9

We would take the position that
Justice -- excuse me, that Judge Niemeyer took

10

below that the appropriate approach is to think

11

about whether citizens have been deliberately

12

burdened because of the views that have been

13

expressed in their prior voting histories.

14

And I guess what I would say is if

15

that -- if that approach isn't going -- is -­

16

is going to work in any case, it's going to

17

work in this one because, here, the evidence is

18

unequivocal that this was the intent.

19

point in fact, the political composition of the

20

district turned 180 degrees.

21

Republican to Democrat, just as the map drawers

22

intended.

And,

It went from

23

And if I could just quickly come back

24

to a point -- a concern that the Chief Justice

25

raised at the argument in Gill against

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
72
1

Whitford, I think the average person on the

2

street understands what partisan gerrymandering

3

is about.

4

individuals because of the way that they have

5

voted and making it more difficult for them to

6

achieve electoral success when plaintiffs -­

7

may I -- may I finish my thought?

It's about map drawers singling out

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

MR. KIMBERLY:

Sure.

When -- when plaintiffs

10

succeed in proving that map drawers have

11

succeeded in rigging an election, they ought to

12

be entitled to relief.

13

the street will understand that.

14
15

For those reasons, we ask the Court to
reverse.

17
