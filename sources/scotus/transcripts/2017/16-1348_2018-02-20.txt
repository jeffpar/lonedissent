CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

4

argument first this morning in Case 16-1348,

5

Currier versus Virginia.

6

Mr. Fisher.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. FISHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

There's no dispute that if Virginia,

12

like Nevada, required severance under the

13

circumstances here, issue preclusion would be

14

available with respect to the second trial.

15

That much is dictated by Turner versus

16

Arkansas.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Doesn't it -­

18

MR. FISHER:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Doesn't -- I'm

Why do you say that?

Meaning, what

So the only -­

20

sorry.

21

Nevada says is no severance, if both parties

22

consent.

23

Nevada?

24

would have been required, correct?

25

So why isn't that exactly like
If you hadn't consented, severance

MR. FISHER:

So my understanding of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
4
1

Nevada law, and just I'm -­

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

MR. FISHER:

Yeah -­

-- without getting into

4

the weeds of exactly what any particular other

5

state law than Virginia requires, but all I'm

6

saying is state law required severance under

7

the circumstances here without -­

8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, it requires

-MR. FISHER:

-- respect to what the

parties -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- severance

unless both parties agree.
MR. FISHER:

That's what Virginia law

says, Your Honor.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

MR. FISHER:

Right.

Right.
So I'm

18

distinguishing Virginia law from a state like

19

Nevada or a state like Arkansas in Turner that

20

just simply demands severance, and it's not up

21

to the parties.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

that's not the same.

24

MR. FISHER:

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't know why

Oh, I think -­
Meaning it -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
5
1

MR. FISHER:

We think it is the same,

2

Your Honor.

So what I'm trying to say is, is

3

that in a state that demands severance, all

4

agree, even my opponents agree, that issue

5

preclusion would be available.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

MR. FISHER:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

MR. FISHER:

10
11

That's Turner.
All right.

Our case -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
that.

That's Turner.

So Turner says

Why is this any different?

12

MR. FISHER:

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

MR. FISHER:

This says -­

I don't think it is.
Okay.

I don't think it is.

And

15

so the only question in this case, though, is

16

whether the fact that Virginia law, as you say,

17

Justice Sotomayor, allows both parties to agree

18

to have a joint trial instead of the default of

19

severance, whether that makes a difference.

20
21

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what to

default -­

22

MR. FISHER:

And we think -­

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

To sort of bracket

24

this problem, what about a jurisdiction like

25

the U.S. courts, where severance is not

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
6
1

required, where there's -- says nothing about

2

severance?

3

MR. FISHER:

I think there's some

4

variance, Your Honor, across the federal

5

courts, but to take your question of one

6

like -­

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

Well, take

8

the -- take the -- the model of the

9

jurisdiction that says nothing about severance

10

of -- of -- of this claim -- of charges like

11

these.

12

MR. FISHER:

Well, we think the answer

13

there would be the same as well, but I would

14

concede it would be a slightly harder case.

15

But the point -- and there are two distinct

16

reasons why consenting to severance in this

17

situation or even, Justice Alito, in the

18

hypothetical you describe should not waive the

19

right to issue preclusion.

20

First, the issue preclusion is a

21

distinct right from the right against multiple

22

trials.

23

trials is not inconsistent with later invoking

24

issue preclusion.

25

And simply consenting to separate

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Fisher -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

MR. FISHER:

And the second -­

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- is that -- is

3

that distinction, that it's not like claim

4

preclusion, more academic than real?

5

in this case, suppose you're right and there

6

can be no retrial of the breaking and entering

7

or of the theft.

8
9
10
11

What's left?

That is,

What would a prosecutor

-- could a prosecutor realistically put on any
case for the felon-in-possession charge?
MR. FISHER:

Well, I think, Justice

12

Ginsburg, it might be a challenge in this case,

13

but it is certainly not theoretical in every

14

case and not even necessarily in this case,

15

depending on how the state would set out to

16

prove the gun charges in the second trial.

17

And I think this is brought out most

18

clearly in the Wittig opinion that Judge

19

Gorsuch -- then Judge Gorsuch wrote for the

20

Tenth Circuit, and that opinion makes it very

21

clear that what issue preclusion provides is

22

the right, as -- as the court put it there, to

23

be tried in a particular way.

24

circumstances, like the Ashe case itself, that

25

is functionally going to bar the second trial.

And so, in some

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
8
1

But, in other cases, like the Wittig

2

case, there will be the opportunity for the

3

government to go forward in the second trial.

4

And that alone defeats the other side's waiver

5

argument because inconsistency is required for

6

a waiver by conduct, and that's the holding of

7

Jeffers and all of the other double jeopardy

8

cases they cite.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

But there is no issue

10

preclusion clause in the Constitution.

11

the -- the double jeopardy provision of the

12

Fifth Amendment, which says that no "person

13

shall be subject for the same offense to be

14

twice put in jeopardy of life or limb."

15
16
17

There's

So isn't Ashe -- doesn't Ashe simply
provide one definition of the same offense?
MR. FISHER:

Yes, that's what the

18

Court said in Yeager.

And I think, to -- to

19

bring that out a little more fully, what Judge

20

Friendly said in the Kramer opinion, and which

21

we think is correct, is when somebody is tried

22

for technically a second crime, but one which

23

depends upon proving allegations the first jury

24

necessarily rejected because it arose from the

25

same transaction and the jury decided those

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
9
1

issue -- issues against the prosecution, then

2

you are functionally being tried for the same

3

offense.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah, but in Jeffers,

5

the Court held that when the second trial

6

involves the same offense under the Blockburger

7

test and the defendant consents, the second

8

trial can go forward.

9

follow that when the defendant consents, if, in

So why should it not

10

fact, that is done, and the second trial

11

involves the same offense under Ashe, this rule

12

should be the same?

13

MR. FISHER:

Well, for two reasons,

14

Justice Alito.

15

that level of generality, I see your point, but

16

if you look at the specific right involved in

17

Jeffers, the defendant requested two trials and

18

then tried to stop the second trial.

19

is fundamentally taking inconsistent positions.

20

The first is, is because, at

So that

Here, Mr. Currier simply consented to

21

separate trials.

He didn't object to the

22

second trial as such.

23

try me in the second case by reproving -- by

24

trying to prove allegations that were rejected

25

in the first trial.

He just said you cannot

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

JUSTICE ALITO:

But wouldn't it be odd

2

to say that the defendant in Jeffers has a

3

lesser double jeopardy right when what he is

4

asserting is consistent with what the Double

5

Jeopardy Clause was originally understood to

6

mean, whereas, in a situation like this, what

7

the defendant is asserting is something that

8

was developed by our cases in the modern era

9

but was not what the Double Jeopardy Clause was

10

originally intended to mean.

11

So, when the defendant is asserting

12

the core double jeopardy right and says, I want

13

a second trial, there can be a second trial,

14

but when the defendant is asserting this new

15

elaboration of the right, there can't be a

16

second trial.

17

Isn't that rather odd?

MR. FISHER:

We don't think so, and

18

let me leave aside for the moment the question

19

whether Ashe is true to the original

20

understanding and just distinguish Jeffers in

21

this way:

22

inviolacy of acquittals, and that, Justice

23

Alito, is the molten core of the -- of the

24

Double Jeopardy Clause, the right not to be

25

tried again for something of which you've been

Which is Ashe deals with the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
11
1

acquitted.

2

And so what the Court said in Ashe and

3

what Judge Friendly said in Kramer before it

4

was the core of the Double Jeopardy Clause does

5

indeed preclude retrials following acquittals,

6

and to have that guarantee, that historical

7

guarantee, have meaning in modern times, it

8

needs to apply under the circumstances here.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

10
11
12

Mr. Fisher -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, what -­

go ahead.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

First, you had a

13

second point you wanted to make, and then I

14

have a question.

15

MR. FISHER:

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17

hear your second point.

18

MR. FISHER:

Thank you.
But I just wanted to

Thank you.

I'll get it

19

on the table.

20

second point to Justice Alito as well, which is

21

the competing interests involved in a case like

22

this, as compared to Jeffers, are dramatically

23

different.

24
25

The second -- and this is the

And if I could give one more sentence
on that, the reason why is because here we're

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1

dealing with an acquittal as opposed to a

2

conviction or simply a mistrial.

3

other hand, because we're dealing with an

4

acquittal and because we're just imposing issue

5

preclusion, the prosecution has a full and fair

6

opportunity to prove all of its charges.

7

so that's what's being taken away from the

8

prosecution in cases like Jeffers and why the

9

Court says it's not fair.

10

And on the

And

But here, the prosecution by

11

definition has an opportunity to prove all of

12

its allegations in the second trial -- is

13

precluded only to the extent that the

14

prosecution would try to retread that ground.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Here -- here's my

16

question:

17

had made very clear to your client the

18

consequences of agreeing to sever.

19

words, suppose that there had been some kind of

20

colloquy and the court had said:

21

you agree to this, one of the things you're

22

agreeing to is that there would -- you won't be

23

able to get issue preclusive effect.

24

that be perfectly fine?

25

Suppose that in this case the court

MR. FISHER:

In other

You know, if

Would

Well, first of all,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1

Justice Kagan, it would not be okay under

2

Virginia law.

3

think that would be a very different question

4

for two reasons.

5

But setting that part aside, I

One is you'd have express waiver in

6

that hypothetical if Mr. Currier agreed to that

7

procedure, and here, I think all agree this is

8

a waiver by conduct case.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

MR. FISHER:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

MR. FISHER:

Do all parties -­

So what you would -­
Please, continue.

So what you would have

13

there is an unconstitutional conditions

14

question.

15

very hard questions and depend very much on the

16

facts of this case.

17

And I think the Court -- those are

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, I guess the -­

18

the reason I ask this is because it seems to me

19

that maybe the problem in this case has to do

20

with the fact that people just don't know what

21

the background rule is, and that we could

22

establish a background rule almost whichever

23

way we establish the background rule and people

24

would then be aware of the consequences going

25

forward when they agree to sever.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

MR. FISHER:

Well, as I said, if you

2

establish the background rule in our favor, I

3

think everything is fine.

4

establish the background rule the other way or

5

if a state were -­

6

(Laughter.)

7

MR. FISHER:

If you were to

-- if a state were to,

8

you'd have an unconstitutional conditions

9

question there.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is it clear that

11

under Virginia law there could not be a joint

12

trial?

13
14
15
16
17

MR. FISHER:

There could be a joint

trial, Justice Kennedy, both -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is it -- is it clear

that severance had to be -- had to be ordered?
MR. FISHER:

So the Hackney case,

18

which is cited in the briefs, lays out Virginia

19

law, and what it says is the trial court must

20

sever unless both parties agree to joinder.

21

And here, both parties consented to

22

the default severance procedure.

23

47 and 48.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's at JA

Mr. Fisher, the

government -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but isn't -­

2

isn't -- doesn't that really set up a waiver?

3

Isn't that something like a waiver if he

4

doesn't agree?

5

MR. FISHER:

Well, we don't think -­

6

we don't think simply agreeing to what the

7

state wants to have in the first place, both as

8

a matter of state law and the prosecutor in

9

this case, should saddle the defendant with

10
11

waiver by conduct.
But if you think -- if you're still

12

not persuaded by that, I would give you the two

13

other reasons I gave Justice Alito, which is to

14

say waiver by conduct can be established only

15

by inconsistency of positions.

16

inconsistency in Mr. Currier's positions.

17

And there's no

And the -- the equities or the

18

competing interests are completely different

19

than all the double jeopardy cases in which

20

they find waiver.

21

It's important to recognize, Justice

22

Kennedy, all the other side's cases that deal

23

with waiver or waiver by conduct or whatever

24

the Court calls it in those cases, all deal

25

with the right to multiple trials.

They all

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

deal with people who were convicted or there

2

was a mistrial.

3

They don't have a single case, and the

4

Court has never held, that the right to the

5

preclusive effect of an acquittal in any form,

6

whether it's claim preclusion or issue

7

preclusion, can be waived.

8
9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And so -­
Are there any cases

where there are bifurcated trials, in other

10

words, the jury -- it's the same jury, but they

11

try the breaking and entering first and the

12

felon-in-possession second, and, if so, would

13

issue preclusion apply there as well?

14

MR. FISHER:

So there are no cases

15

from this Court dealing with bifurcation.

16

Indiana amicus brief describes the fact that

17

some states actually handle this situation by

18

bifurcation.

19

and the rules there would be the same as in

20

severance because -­

21

The

And we think the outcome there

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Fisher, what

22

would happen in those bifurcated trials where

23

-- it happens routinely in the Second Circuit:

24

Same jury, you try the breaking and entering

25

first or the robbery first, and then you try

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1

the felon-in-possession.

2

Would double jeopardy bar the trial of

3

the gun once there's been a conviction on the

4

first charge, on the robbery or the breaking

5

and entering?

6

MR. FISHER:

Not if there's a

7

conviction, Your Honor, but if there's an

8

acquittal.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

MR. FISHER:

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Under Jeffers.

Under Jeffers.
But what you're

12

saying is if there's not, if there's an

13

acquittal, that issue preclusion would bar the

14

second trial?

15
16

MR. FISHER:

That's right.

And I

think maybe it's -­

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

MR. FISHER:

That's Turner?

That's Turner.

It's also

Yeager.

20

to understand how close this case is to Yeager.

21

And -­

22

I think it's important for the Court

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

By the way, it was

23

the government who went to the defendant and

24

said consent to or agree to the severed trials?

25

MR. FISHER:

So my understanding is,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

is that during pre-trial proceedings, the

2

government -- or, I'm sorry, the state, the

glad you asked about Powell, because it brings

3

And so let me distinguish

What Powell says is that if a jury

simultaneously convicts and acquits on -- on

counts that are in an inconsistent manner, we

accept that verdict in all of its form, as you

know.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

just to pause, why is that?
MR. FISHER:

Because it's out of

15

respect for the jury, Your Honor.

That's the

16

thread that runs through these cases.

17

In -- in Powell, the Court said the

18

jury might have been exercising mercy, as is

19

its right, and so we're not going to upset the

20

acquittal any more than we're going to upset

21

the conviction in the other direction.

Suppose you prevail

in this case.

Would a state then say, okay,

evidence about the felony.

Don't -- do you -- are you happy with
what you wish for here?

3

MR. FISHER:

Justice Kennedy, that's

4

not been the experience in states that have our

5

rule.

6

footnote in our reply brief, Florida and Iowa

7

are two states that have had our rule for

8

decades, and there have been no change in the

9

way severance has -­

10

So, as we lay out in -- at our -- at a

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why?

Why?

That's -­

11

I mean, that's the part -- the point that was a

12

very practical point.

13

When I'm a judge on the First Circuit,

14

I would say in multiple party, multiple, you

15

know, gang cases and so forth, one of the most

16

common things was a defendant would appeal,

17

either saying it should have been a sever, he

18

should have been severed if he wasn't, or he

19

shouldn't have been if he was, and so forth.

20

Very, very common.

21

And so what was worrying me is that

22

the prosecution, if we -- if we adopt something

23

like you say, and the defendant comes in and

24

says, I want to be severed here at least as to

25

some of the counts, the prosecutor thinks, if I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

22

agree to that, I don't know what's going to

2

happen.

3

You know, we'll get some kind of a

4

verdict in this first case.

5

the second case is that his lawyer is going to

6

argue that there are various aspects of it that

7

are inconsistent with going ahead with this and

8

we're not going to be ahead with it.

9

there will be some appeals.

nightmare.

11

just say no.

12

And all I know in

At worst,

It's going to be a

And the best thing for me to do is

And -- and that is exactly what is

13

worrying me.

And -- and you have an

14

alternative.

You can say treat the severance

15

as if it were a single trial and just, as you

16

say, he waived the double jeopardy matter when

17

he appeals, so you could say he waived it when

18

he asked for the second trial, you know, when

19

he asked for the separate trial.

20

I have a problem with theirs too, so

21

I'm not just saying that -- that this is the

22

problem I had with yours.

23

hasn't worked out that way in Florida.

24
25

MR. FISHER:

So you say, well, it
Hmm.

Well, as -- as I say, to

the extent we have empirical evidence, it -- it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

-- it supports my position.

2
3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why wouldn't it work

out that way?

4
5

Let me give you -­

MR. FISHER:

Let me tell you two

reasons -­

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

MR. FISHER:

Yeah.

-- Justice Breyer.

So

8

the first is remember why severance is -- is -­

9

is the default rule here in the first place.

10

It's because of the confounding influence that

11

prior convictions have on a jury's ability to

12

reach accurate verdicts.

13

like defense lawyers, have a very strong

14

interest in accurate verdicts out of criminal

15

trials.

16

And prosecutors, just

And, secondly, even from a research

17

management standpoint, which sounds to me more

18

like what you're thinking about here, the

19

prosecution may well agree to severance for a

20

couple of reasons.

21

One is because, if -- if the

22

prosecution gets a conviction, the prosecution

23

can choose to try its stronger claim first.

24

the prosecution gets a conviction, the

25

prosecution can do just what the state

Heritage Reporting Corporation

If

Official

suggested it was going to do here, which is

2

just drop the second charge because it's a -­

4

JUSTICE BREYER:
reasons -­

5

MR. FISHER:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

-- less important crime.
What I'm worried

about -­

8
9

But there will be

MR. FISHER:

And it would run

concurrent.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm worried about

11

other -- that there are other situations.

12

the most common claim was I should have been

13

severed and I wasn't, or vice versa, they never

14

win.

15
16
17

And

I mean, the claim hardly ever wins.
It's really left to the trial judge.

And so I -- I -- I recall that.
MR. FISHER:

Well, we don't have a

18

problem leaving severance decisions to trial

19

judges according to the various rules across

20

the country.

21

defendant -­

22

All we're saying is if a

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah, I'm not -- that

23

isn't -- I'm just so worried about this

24

prosecutor who now is going to take the

25

government's position against and throw, in a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
25
1

very big trial with 19 defendants, some guy who

2

happened to be on the corner, you know, and the

3

jury isn't going to distinguish among them, and

4

you see where I'm going.

5

MR. FISHER:

Remember, though, Justice

6

Breyer, I don't think prosecutors are going to

7

necessarily act that way because they have an

8

interest in justice just like the defense does.

9

And, secondly, think -- if they play

10

it out in their minds, if they get a conviction

11

in the first case, they're very likely to just

12

drop the second case or, if the second case is

13

also important, the defense at that point -­

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MR. FISHER:

I see, I see.

-- is likely to plead

16

because he's already been to trial on roughly

17

the same facts.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Fisher, don't

19

we have a case that says this issue preclusion

20

is only between the same parties?

21
22
23

MR. FISHER:

Yes, you do, Justice

Sotomayor, so I -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And we have a case

24

that says, if another defendant gets an

25

acquittal, that doesn't help you?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
26
1

MR. FISHER:

That's Standefer.

That's

2

right.

And so, Justice Breyer, I think, is -­

3

to the extent you're asking about other

4

defendants, that's a separate problem, but I

5

think you're also asking about same defendants.

6

And let me just continue to play that out for

7

you.

8
9

So the -- even when the conviction
happens, it's going to be very unlikely that -­

10

that there's going to be a drain on resources

11

or any problem.

12

first case is going to be very, very rare, as

13

they are in criminal cases.

JUSTICE ALITO:

I'm sorry.

your sentence.

20

MR. FISHER:

Oh, I'll just finish my

21

sentence.

When an acquittal happens, the

22

prosecution then may well drop the second

23

charges.

24

that's exactly what the Double Jeopardy Clause

25

is concerned with.

But if the prosecution pushes ahead,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is -- is there

2

anything to indicate that the result would be

3

different -- would have been different in

4

Jeffers if the first trial had been an

5

acquittal?

6

MR. FISHER:

Well, the justice who

7

wrote Jeffers, Justice Blackmun, signed on to

Green as -­

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah.

10

MR. FISHER:

11

it would have been different.

He said -­

-- later on, saying yes,

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

13

MR. FISHER:

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

He said it later.

Yeah.
But the Double

15

Jeopardy Clause doesn't draw a distinction

16

between convictions and -- and acquittals, does

17

it?

18

MR. FISHER:

Well, in case after

19

case -- I think Scott is the best example I

20

could give you, where Chief Justice Rehnquist

21

went on at great length about how there's a

22

special place for acquittals under the Double

23

Jeopardy Clause and special rules apply to

24

acquittals.

25

Just -- just take, for example, an

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
28
1

appeal for -- appeal for sufficiency of the

2

evidence.

3

there's insufficient evidence and therefore the

4

defendant should have been acquitted, he cannot

be retried.

7

some other error in the case, he can be

8

retried.

9

If an appellate court finds that

On the other hand, if the

So the Double Jeopardy Clause does

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

up in Bravo-Fernandez.

The -- the distinction doesn't hold

I said, is a case like Powell.

17

be clear what I mean when -­

18
19
20

Well, but not

Well, Bravo-Fernandez, as

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And so let me

Yeah, I think

so.
MR. FISHER:

-- when I say acquittal.

21

What I mean by an acquittal is not simply the

22

piece of paper of an acquittal but an acquittal

23

that we can say establishes an issue of

24

ultimate fact against the prosecution.

25

And so, when we have an acquittal like

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
29
1

that, which is what we had in Yeager and which

2

was distinguished from the situation in Powell

3

and later distinguished from Bravo-Fernandez,

4

then that acquittal has issue-preclusive

5

effect.

6

contrary on those facts and that are clearly

7

our facts here, and it's clearly Turner as

8

well.

9

And the Court has never held to the

A case where the prosecution is forced

10

to wait for its second case, to be -- for the

11

second counts to be tried, but as soon as the

12

jury comes back with an acquittal, the Double

13

Jeopardy Clause and, indeed, the Constitution

14

in general vests that acquittal with special

inviolacy.

Justice Story's Commentaries, where he said

that -- that acquittals have to be -- that the

purity and dignity of acquittals needs to be

side's position here is not just that in a case

like this issue preclusion wouldn't be

leads inevitably to the conclusion that if

there were a greater and lesser offense and the

first trial was for the lesser offense and the

defendant was acquitted, that in this situation

9

the defendant would not even be able to invoke

the right to issue preclusion.

12
13

You know, the other

result.

And so the prosecution -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Fisher, the

14

issue preclusion was taken over into the

15

criminal context in Ashe, but it originated in

16

civil cases.

17

Is there any difference between issue

18

preclusion as it would apply in a civil case

19

and in a criminal case?

20

MR. FISHER:

Well, not for purposes of

21

this case, Justice Ginsburg.

As -- as -- as

22

the Court wrote in Bravo-Fernandez, you have to

23

be careful in criminal cases when you decide

24

what issues of ultimate fact the first jury

25

decided because of the nature of general

Heritage Reporting Corporation

verdicts in criminal cases.

2

But, as to the scope of issue

preclusion once you establish what issues of

6

same rule that carries over to -­

7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Mr. Fisher, are we

8

confident that civil issue preclusion would

apply in circumstances like these, where a

party consents to a bifurcated trial, or might

11

it be more law of the case where it's more

12

equitable?

13

I know you cite an old Tenth Circuit

case suggesting issue preclusion might apply

here, but it's -- it's a malleable doctrine

MR. FISHER:

Justice Gorsuch.

we could and were only able to scrape out a few

25

cases.

The other side -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

MR. FISHER:

Yeah.

The other side I don't

6

think disputes -- you can ask them, but I

7

didn't take them to dispute our -- our

8

representation based on civil law, the civil

9

side of things.

10

And also I'd point you to Judge

Friendly's opinion in Kramer, where, on page

12

917, he surveys older cases from this Court

13

that are civil, and those cases, the Keokuk

14

case is one.

15

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But you'd agree in

16

civil cases -- or maybe you wouldn't, tell me

17

if I'm wrong -- that in civil cases it's not a

18

foregone conclusion that issue preclusion would

19

apply in these circumstances.

20

of the case, and it might be subject to some

21

consideration about the defendant's consent?

22

mean -­

23

MR. FISHER:

24

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

25

It might be law

I

Well, we -­
-- you'd agree that

your research did not prove that this would be

obviously precluded even in a -- in a civil

matter?

MR. FISHER:

Well -- well, I'll just

that effect.

So there's not a -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

7

MR. FISHER:

8

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

9

MR. FISHER:

Fair -­

-- absolute answer.
Fair enough.

Yeah.

But we think it should

10

apply for all the same reasons we'd be saying

11

here.

12

though, if there's any doubt that the reason

13

for applying issue preclusion is enhanced in

14

the criminal context when you have the special

15

nature of an acquittal -­

16

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

17

But the -- I would just add to that,

Well, what do we do

about -­

18

MR. FISHER:

-- and that's -­

19

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

What do we do about

20

the fact that claim preclusion in the criminal

21

context isn't as robust, in the criminal

22

context, under Blockburger as it would be in

23

the civil context?

24

in the civil context and an elements test in

25

the criminal context.

We use a transaction test

We shouldn't be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

concerned that it's anomalous that it would be

2

creating a -- an issue preclusion doctrine that

3

may be more robust than in the civil context

4

here, even though in claim preclusion it's less

5

robust?

6

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think, Justice

7

Gorsuch, it's perhaps helpful to separate -­

8

separate out the substantive boundaries of the

9

doctrine, whether it be claim preclusion and

10

issue preclusion, from the -- from the question

11

whether they can be waived.

12

And so we leave the substantive

13

boundaries of issue preclusion and, obviously,

14

claim preclusion where we found them.

15

to waiver, we don't think it's anomalous to say

16

that an acquittal -- the preclusive effect of

17

an acquittal is harder to waive than the right

18

to claim preclusion for the competing interests

I've mentioned and because of the lack of

inconsistency.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW R. McGUIRE

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

3
4

MR. McGUIRE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

5

The difficult question presented in

6

this case can be answered by applying the logic

7

of three principles this Court has already

8

embraced.

9

First, when a defendant agrees to have

10

multiple trials, he gives up his right to argue

11

that the later trial is barred based on double

12

jeopardy.

question presented to the Court in this case

24

law.

25

consents to have sequential trials.

It's just whether -- when a defendant

that begs the question.

3

MR. McGUIRE:

But if the Court does go

4

beyond sort of the question presented and look

5

at Virginia law here, the facts in this case,

6

and you can see this in the November 20, 2013,

7

brief in support of the motion in limine, and

8

the record here isn't fulsome on the point, but

9

this is from the defendant himself.

The way

10

this case actually ends up being severed is the

11

defendant in court with a different

needs to be severed.

there's a motion.

Green, what the court there said was you do, in

Here, we don't think there is a

2

Hobson's choice at all because the Court has

3

always looked at the prejudice associated with

4

prior felony status as a matter of evidentiary

5

rule.

And so there's not a constitutional
due process argument on the other side.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The state -- the

state has made a different determination.

The

10

state has said that presumptively these charges

11

are prejudicial if they're tried together, and

12

presumptively we won't permit it.

13

MR. McGUIRE:

Well, what Hackney says

14

ultimately is that the -- the -- Virginia wants

15

to give extra protections to criminal

16

defendants in this context, to allow them to

17

have control over the proceedings, which is

18

what this Court has, generally speaking, looked

19

to.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, but that's not

21

true, because it gives not just the defendant

22

but the state the right.

23

24

agree to it as well.

representation based on Hackney from the

Commonwealth's attorney.

example, was going to testify at the trial, and

13

he knew that his prior status was coming in

14

anyway, he may very well prefer to have a

15

single trial, and he could have brought that

16

forward to the Commonwealth attorney's

17

attention, and there's no sign that they would

have said no to that procedure.

If the defendant, for

And so what we think under Hackney is

20

you look at what the defendant himself did.

21

Here, the defendant consented.

where the defendant wants to have a joint trial

wouldn't argue waiver by conduct in that case.

JUSTICE BREYER:

In the case

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. -- I'm

sorry.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

I -- I -- look, it's

4

complicated.

5

And -- and tell me what's wrong with this

6

simplification.

7

And I keep trying to simplify it.

All right.

Let's take two examples,

8

or three.

Example 1, all right, the defendant

9

is accused of two crimes, A and B.

10

first on A and acquitted.

11

later the prosecution decides B.

12

He is tried

Then a few months

Now nobody objects, do they, two

13

totally separate trials, no nothing, that this

14

issue preclusion thing applies in B, however it

15

applies.

16

applies in B.

17
18
19

I mean, however it applies, it
Is that right?

MR. McGUIRE:

That's right, Justice

Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

20

Example 2.

21

both A and B in the same trial.

22

Now let's take

Example 2 is they decide to try

Now here, if he's found guilty of one,

23

even if it's totally inconsistent, the verdict

24

stands, right?

25

MR. McGUIRE:

That's right.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
43
1

JUSTICE BREYER:

And the reason it's

2

right is because this is in a sense allowing a

3

little bit of jury nullification in.

4

Well, the jury thinks that's the fair thing to

5

do.

We think:

Okay?

6

Now, if those are the two examples, we

7

have here Example 3.

It is a different jury,

8

but it once was not.

So, since it is a

9

different jury, our reason for allowing the

10

inconsistent verdicts in my example no longer

11

exists.

12

This was not a jury that saw the whole

13

thing.

14

And, therefore, let him assert the double

15

jeopardy, whatever it is, because our reason

16

for not doing it isn't there.

17

It was a jury that only saw this case.

Now, of course, we'd have to have a

18

corollary, unfortunately, for -- what did you

19

call it, the -- the bifurcated jury, because

20

there it is the same jury.

21

to do about that one.

22

I don't know what

But -- but the -- the -- in -- in

23

these three, see, my three examples, I just say

24

is the reason for Example 1 there in our case,

25

answer no, so treat it like two separate

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
44
1

trials.

2

And, by the way, if the prosecutor has

3

a problem, he can always insist on a written

4

waiver if the defendant really wants the

5

separate trial.

All right.

6

So what's wrong with my examples?

7

MR. McGUIRE:

So, Justice Breyer, I

8

think your -- the way you approached the

9

hypothetical is to bracket this case with the

10

issue preclusion cases, Powell, Bravo-Fernandez

11

and Yeager.

12

What we think the right set of cases

13

for the Court to look at in deciding the issue

14

here are the multiple trial right cases where

15

the -- what you -- you don't necessarily look

16

at the acquittal that came up in the middle of

17

the trial.

18

What you ask -- or in the split

19

proceedings here.

20

defendant take an act before the acquittal

21

arose that presupposed he would have two

22

trials?

23

What you ask is, did the

And so here, under and consistent with

24

all the precedent on mistrials or motions to

25

dismiss, you have a case where the defendant

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

agreed to have the prosecute -- agreed to have

2

two trials ever -- before he was acquitted, and

3

he necessarily undertook the risk -­

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

MR. McGUIRE:

6
7

Well -­
-- of inconsistent

verdicts.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- Mr. McGuire, I

8

mean, it's one thing to say, as we've said many

9

times, that when you say I want two trials,

10

that what you've given up is the right to

11

object about two trials.

12

is inconsistent.

13

multiple trials, or preferring multiple trials,

14

then you can't assert your right against

15

multiple trials.

16

Right?

That really

If you're insisting on

But that's not this case.

Somebody

17

can say I want two trials and still have it in

18

his view that, in that second trial, normal

19

issue preclusion principles will apply.

20

sometimes that will prevent the second trial,

21

but sometimes it won't prevent the second trial

22

because the government can prove its case

23

another way.

24
25

So

And so there's no inconsistency of the
kind that exists in claim preclusion in this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
46
1

kind of case, is there?

2

MR. McGUIRE:

Well, there is, Justice

3

Kagan, because issue preclusion has to be

4

understood as part of the three core

5

protections under the Double Jeopardy Clause.

6

And so the hypothetical that you spun out there

7

suggests that issue preclusion does serve to

8

bar only evidence in some cases and not

9

necessarily preclude a trial.

10

It's important to note that in none of

11

this Court's cases addressing issue preclusion

12

has that ever been the result.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

14

don't understand what that means.

15

Solicitor General says that as well in its

16

brief, and I didn't understand that either,

17

because surely the government doesn't mean that

18

if the government couldn't prove their case

19

another way, the government could try to do so.

20

Right?

21

Well, I don't -- I
The -- the

I mean, if the government could prove

22

their case another way, then the trial isn't

23

barred.

24

the government proving its case another way.

25

Right?

The trial goes forward with

MR. McGUIRE:

Well, what we would say,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
47
1

Justice Kagan, is that just means issue

2

preclusion doesn't apply at all in that case

3

because, when issue preclusion applies in the

4

criminal context, it serves only to bar the

5

trial.

6

And Dowling really is a good example

7

of this dealing with 404(b) identification

8

evidence.

9

acquitted there.

10

In that case, the defendant had been

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, whatever you

11

call it, the point still stands that the

12

defendant is in a position where it's perfectly

13

consistent to say two things:

14

like two trials, and in that second trial, I

15

expect that issue preclusion principles will

16

apply.

17

Yes, I would

That's very different from the kind of

18

inconsistency that we've pointed out in the

19

past, where the government can't -- the person

20

can't say on the one hand I want two trials and

21

say on the other hand I don't want two trials.

22

MR. McGUIRE:

Well, Justice Kagan, I

23

think we're maybe speaking past each other just

24

a little bit.

25

Let me try again to be a little bit

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
48
1

clearer, which is our position is that once the

2

defendant says in the second trial I want to

3

argue issue preclusion, issue preclusion

4

principles would apply to limit the

5

government's theories, that issue preclusion

6

doesn't do that, and that this Court has never

7

held that to be the case.

8

In fact, in the briefing in Ashe, the

9

briefs disclaim that they were ever asking the

10

court for a rule on that fashion.

So what we

11

would say is that when you raise issue

12

preclusion, when you say I want to raise that

13

to bar the -- to do something related to the

14

Double Jeopardy Clause, the only thing you can

15

be saying is that the second trial cannot go

16

forward at all because the same ultimate fact

17

from the first trial has to be proven in the

18

second one.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well -­

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

And the Commonwealth

21

could have proved the second offense without

22

making any reference to the breaking and

23

entering of the residence or the theft of the

24

safe.

They could have called Wood and they

25

say:

Where were you on such and such a date,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
49
1

such and such a time?

I was by the river.

2

what were you doing?

I had a safe with guns

3

and money.

4

No.

Petitioner was with me.

5

do?

He took out the guns and he was possessing

6

the guns.

7

And

And was -- were you by yourself?
And what did he

They could have done that.
But I bet if they had done -- I don't

8

think Mr. Fisher would say that that would be

9

okay.

10
11

I think he would say that would still be

barred by -- by issue preclusion.
And if that is the case and the

12

defense understood at the time when they agreed

13

to the second trial that the prosecution would

14

not be able to prove the second offense in that

15

way, then I don't see why they didn't

16

understand the consequences of agreeing to the

17

second trial with respect to issue preclusion

18

to exactly the same extent as they understood

19

the consequences with respect to a -- a second

20

trial in the Jeffers situation.

21

MR. McGUIRE:

We think that's exactly

22

right, Justice Alito.

And it's also important

23

to explain why having an evidentiary rule here

24

would be problematic in a number of ways.

25

For example, here, one piece of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
50
1

evidence that comes up a lot from my friend on

2

the other side is the cigarette butt with the

3

DNA that was found in the car.

4

well, that didn't get into evidence at the

5

first trial, but it was introduced at the

6

second, so in some sense, it's -- you're seeing

7

the dry run problem.

8

And they say,

But it's not clear why that evidence

9

wouldn't come in anyway in the second trial.

10

It's not linked necessarily to the burglary.

11

It's just a cigarette butt in the truck.

12

And so it's not clear how this would

13

actually work in practice to a very real

14

degree, but we do think that the Court should

15

just link issue preclusion directly with the

16

multiple trial right.

17

earlier, it has not been understood generally

18

as normal civil issue preclusion in this

19

context.

20

To one of the questions

And if you look at the various

21

opinions, including then Judge Gorsuch's

22

opinion in Wittig or Kramer, what you see are

23

really two different strands of issue

24

preclusion analysis that go on in federal

25

courts in particular.

One is under the Double

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
51
1

Jeopardy Clause where it would serve to bar a

2

second trial, and another is sort of a federal

3

judicial -- federal oversight of the judiciary,

4

as coming under Oppenheimer.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

Can we -- can we
The

preclusion in criminal cases.
I see nothing in our cases that

12

requires overreaching in order to apply issue

13

preclusion.

14

MR. McGUIRE:

Justice Ginsburg, we

15

agree that the court of appeals looked at

16

prosecutorial overreach as an important

17

component of the Double Jeopardy Clause.

18

are not suggesting that the defendant needs to

19

prove prosecutorial overreaching in order to

20

assert issue preclusion.

We

21

But we think the best way to look at

22

the concept in this case generally is the way

23

Johnson framed it, which is that issue

24

preclusion really applies where the state has

25

made an effort to prosecute you seriatim, and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

so where the defendant has the choice to

consent and, in fact, does consent, you don't

hands on this case, which is filled with

complexity.

Just say:

-- we're not certain -- we don't have to decide

the contours of issue preclusion.

enough agreement among the lower courts and in

17

this Court that there is something to it in

18

some cases?

19

And then say:

Isn't there

Whatever that is -­

20

we're leaving it, you know, to the research and

21

so forth, but whatever that is, the question

22

here is whether the doctrine, in some form or

23

other, applies when there is the second trial

24

as a result of the -- the Virginia law or as a

25

result of the waiver or as a result of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
53
1

whatever.

2

Can we just do that?
MR. McGUIRE:

So we just

-- in your opinion?

That's the easiest way

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. McGUIRE:

Yeah.

And we think that the

22

best -- the clearest articulation of the rule

23

that underlies a lot of this Court's double

24

jeopardy precedent is that what the Court wants

25

is for the defendant to have as much control as

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
54
1

possible over the way the course of proceedings

2

will play out.

3

him the right to force severance, and Justice

4

Sotomayor is right, there is a particular

5

scenario -­

6

And so here Virginia has given

You say:

9

How about if he
Do you agree?

Judge, that's what the law says.
MR. McGUIRE:

Our position, Justice

10

Sotomayor, would be if he doesn't object to it,

11

then that is the same thing.

12

willingly with the two trials.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

He's gone ahead

All right.

So he

14

has -- he has no rights under Virginia law, is

15

what you're saying -­

16

MR. McGUIRE:

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, he has -­
-- to maintain his

18

-- he has to go to trial and suffer the

19

prejudice to be able to retain his double

20

jeopardy claims?

21

MR. McGUIRE:

To argue issue

22

preclusion here and to not have this waiver

23

argument, he would have to want to go to a

24

joint trial.

25

the Commonwealth -- and the Commonwealth forced

And if he wanted to do that, then

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
55
1

him into multiple trials, we would not argue

2

any sort of waiver there.

3

But, as we pointed out on brief, there

4

is good reasons why a defendant might want one

5

trial in a case like this one:

6

to testify or if he has some awareness that the

7

evidence might come in under Rule 404(b), for

8

example.

9

the context -- context of that first trial that

If he intends

The jury is going to learn anyway in

10

he is a prior felon or has some prior criminal

11

history.

12

And so there, there's no benefit to

13

the defendant of having two trials.

14

only reason in a sense it looks unfair in this

15

case is because he's already made some

16

litigation decisions, that he's not going to

17

testify or that he doesn't think the evidence

18

is going to come in that way.

19

So the

And so, once he's made some choices,

20

he's going to either have one trial where he

21

now has allowed this to come in to prove the

22

felon-in-possession charge, or he goes to two

23

trials, in which case our position is he's

24

given up his right to argue that the second

25

trial should be barred.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
56
1

And I want to come back to one thing

2

Justice Breyer and Justice Kennedy raised

3

earlier.

4

example of the state doing more than the

5

Constitution requires in some sense.

6

Court has not said that introducing evidence of

7

prior felony status is a constitutional

8

violation.

There -- this case does present an

This

9

And where you have the Court of

10

Appeals of Virginia interpreting a state

11

judicial rule to have this severance package,

12

it wouldn't be a stretch to think that if that

13

necessarily takes away the Commonwealth's right

14

to try a defendant for all the charges that

15

they have brought forward, that the state

16

supreme court could revisit that judicial

17

interpretation.

18

Other states may have it as a statute

19

or there may be a binding decision from the

20

state's highest court.

21

have that here.

22

a -- an unfortunate risk that what is a

pro-criminal defendant measure may ultimately

24

be retracted if defendants can't be seen as

having given up their right to argue that the

I would also just like to note for the

Court that we also briefed the issue of if the

5

could go ahead and address whether the

Petitioner carried his burden under Ashe and

Yeager of showing that an issue of ultimate

fact was necessarily decided in this case.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

that would be left over for remand.

question we have is the waiver:

does he waive issue preclusion if he accepts

reasons Justice Alito gave earlier, this case

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERICA L. ROSS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

8

IN SUPPORT OF THE RESPONDENT

9
10
11

MS. ROSS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The Double Jeopardy Clause provides

12

defendants with a right against multiple trials

13

for the same offense, but it does not protect a

14

defendant from the consequences of his

15

voluntary litigation choices.

16

Whereas here, a defendant agrees to

17

multiple trials on different charges in order

18

to obtain a benefit, he cannot thereafter argue

19

that his charges are, in fact, one offense for

20

purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Ms. Ross, why

22

not make sure that it actually is the

23

defendant's choice?

I mean, if it were, that

24

would be one thing.

So why isn't the best rule

25

a rule that says we're going to insist that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
59
1

some kind of colloquy takes place where the

2

judge says to the defendant, you know, if -- if

3

you want these two trials, here's the result of

4

that; you lose the ability to argue issue

5

preclusion?

6

think about this kind of problem?

7

Why isn't that the best way to

MS. ROSS:

So I think that's not the

8

best way to think about this kind of problem,

9

Your Honor, because the -- this Court's cases

10

do not generally think about the double

11

jeopardy right in those terms.

12

So, in Dinitz, for example, this Court

13

specifically held that a defendant's claim that

14

he did not knowingly and intelligently waive

15

his right to have a double jeopardy claim was

16

not for -- was not the right way to think about

17

that issue because, in fact, the Court sort of

18

presupposes that in these circumstances these

19

are litigation decisions that may be difficult

20

that may be made sort of in -­

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But your argument is

22

all about voluntary choices on the part of the

23

defendant, and you're essentially arguing a

24

kind of waiver by conduct.

25

And what I'm suggesting is if this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
60
1

is -- you know, if this -- if the way to think

2

about this case is what is the defendant giving

3

up when he agrees to a severance, then the

4

obvious answer is:

5

consequences are, and ask him whether he's

6

willing to suffer them.

7

MS. ROSS:

Tell the defendant what the

Your Honor, that might be

8

one way to deal with the problem.

I think, as

9

Justice Kennedy and Justice Breyer were

10

suggesting earlier, if that is the way that is

11

adopted, it is likely that many states would

12

choose not to go through that process because,

13

again, the -- this Court has made very clear

14

that the introduction of evidence of a

15

defendant's prior convictions is not itself a

16

due process violation.

17

So severance is not required as a

18

matter of -- of federal law here.

And so I

19

think if states are required to go through a

20

knowing and voluntary waiver process, that then

21

may -- I mean, we think those waivers would be

22

completely enforceable, but I take my friend's

23

argument to be that they might not be, in fact.

24

And so some defendants would, in fact,

25

challenge those waivers, and the state would be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
61
1

opening itself up on the back end to at least

2

litigation and inefficiency that it does not

3

need to open itself up to.

4

I also think that in this case the

5

most logical way to have looked at this

6

agreement ex ante would have been for the

7

defendant to know that he was giving up his

8

right to -- to challenge the fact that these

9

were held in one proceeding.

10

So you can look at this a few

11

different ways.

12

think that this agreement was made so that the

13

evidence of Petitioner's prior felony

14

convictions would not come in at the first

15

trial, but aside from that, nothing in this

16

agreement was meant to or did, by -- by its

17

terms, say that the other options for potential

18

outcomes that would have been possible in one

19

trial would be off the table.

20

I think one of them is to

So, as some of the discussion earlier

21

suggested, had this happened in one trial,

22

Petitioner could have been convicted on all

23

offenses, acquitted on all offenses, or some

24

mix thereof, and nothing about saying I want to

25

have two trials so that this other evidence

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
62
1

doesn't come in logically suggests that he's

2

retaining the option to keep one of those from

3

happening.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but maybe the

5

defendant understands that we in our Double

6

Jeopardy Clause have -- have emphasized pretty

7

strongly the value of acquittals, and that

8

acquittals mean something in our system, and

9

they preclude the government from doing certain

10

things that are inconsistent with those

11

acquittals.

12

So I guess -- I guess I don't -- don't

13

understand why, in the absence of a colloquy,

14

and given the backdrop of double jeopardy law

15

that focuses so much on not doing anything

16

that's inconsistent with acquittals, the

17

defendant would, of course, know that he was

18

giving up his right to issue preclusion?

19

MS. ROSS:

Right, Your Honor.

And I

20

think that this goes back to some of the

21

discussion that Justice Alito was having

22

earlier, which is to say that the question in

23

this case, I think, is -- is best

24

conceptualized as:

25

agree not to invoke and what is he trying to

What right did defendant

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1

invoke now?

2

And I think that what this agreement

3

said was that I'm going to have multiple

4

trials.

5

protects is multiple -- against is multiple

6

trials for the same offense.

7

And so what the Double Jeopardy Clause

And so, when Petitioner made that

8

agreement, he was essentially saying I'm not

9

going to fight later about this is one -­

10

whether this is one offense or -­

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

12

MS. ROSS:

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but -­

-- multiple offenses.
-- then you're saying,

14

when you say the Double Jeopardy Clause

15

protects multiple trials for the same offense,

16

that's one thing that the Double Jeopardy

17

Clause protects.

18

And another thing that the Double

19

Jeopardy Clause protects -- and this is the

20

difference between the claim preclusion aspect

21

of it and the issue preclusion aspect of it -­

22

is the preservation of acquittals.

23
24
25

And that's what is involved in this
case.
MS. ROSS:

So, Your Honor, I would

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64
1

just note that the way that the Double Jeopardy

2

Clause protects acquittals is in two specific

3

ways, and we lay this out in our papers.

4

On the one hand, as everyone agrees

5

here, following an acquittal, a defendant

6

cannot be tried again.

7

particular claim, he cannot -- the government

8

cannot appeal.

9

Everyone agrees that's being respected here.

10

So he can't -- on that

There cannot be another trial.

The second way that this Court's

11

decisions in the Double Jeopardy Clause protect

12

acquittals is by modifying the definition of

13

the same offense for purposes of the multiple

14

trials analysis.

15

So what -- the way that we give

16

finality to an acquittal is by saying that, in

17

fact, that acquitted offense was the same

18

offense as another offense that is technically

19

distinct for charging purposes.

20

And in this case, when -­

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, what's

22

technically distinct about having committed a

23

robbery against two people?

24

person, those are distinct crimes.

25

MS. ROSS:

If you rob each

That's correct, Your Honor.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
65
1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But we don't

2

permit you to try a person for robbing one

3

person and then try the second crime, which is

4

not technically distinct, it's distinct

5

completely, there are different people

6

involved.

7

person, that second crime.

We don't let you try that second

8

MS. ROSS:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10
11

That's correct -­
If you've been

acquitted.
MS. ROSS:

That's correct, Justice

12

Sotomayor.

13

you to try that second acquittal or that second

14

offense is because, for purposes of the Double

15

Jeopardy Clause and for purposes of how we

16

define the same offense, we say that in those

17

circumstances, just as in Blockburger we say

18

that sometimes things that are technically

19

distinct, meaning they're in different code

20

sections, are the same offense because they

21

have overlapping elements.

22

And the reason why we don't allow

Here, we say that they're the same

23

offense because they have over -- an issue of

24

ultimate fact that the prosecution necessarily

25

must prove in both cases.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But they wouldn't

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's claim

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They wouldn't be

6

the same offense, the claim preclusion first,

7

in the Ashe case, multiple victims.

8

claim preclusion when there's a second victim

9

because it's a different -- different party.

There's no

10

But there certainly is issue preclusion because

11

of what was necessarily determined in the first

case.

13

MS. ROSS:

That's correct, Justice

14

Ginsburg.

15

the defendant cannot be tried for the second

16

offense.

17

And in Ashe, what happens is that

Now I take Petitioner to agree that,

18

if that were what he were arguing, he could not

go forward with that.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Defense in the first

4

The

Okay?

Now we're into the second case and he

5

was just as much in Chicago.

6

you're saying he waived that when the only

7

difference is that you separated the trial.

8

That's all.

9

and now it's separate.

10

All right?

Now,

They started trying both together
But it ends up two

separate trials.

11

And what I think I'm having trouble

12

grasping is why you should treat that any

13

differently.

14

he's waived it by conduct.

15

And now your argument is because

So Justice Kagan says, hey, he's

16

waived it by conduct.

Let's just be sure he

17

waived it.

18

wants to waive it, because after all the

19

Constitution says that no person shall be held,

20

you know, for jeopardy twice, or whatever it

21

is.

Let him waive it expressly, if he

22

And now we -­

23

(Laughter.)

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Okay.

You get the

point?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
68
1

MS. ROSS:

Yes, Justice Breyer, I do.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

You get the point.

3

He's waiving a constitutional right and,

4

therefore, why shouldn't it be express?

5

that's -- that is where I think I stop because

6

I want to know your answer.

7

MS. ROSS:

And

Certainly, Justice Breyer.

8

So my answer is that the same argument could

9

have been made and I think, in fact, was made

10

in Jeffers, that essentially in Jeffers the

11

defendant said:

12

And then later he said:

13

is a lesser included offense in a greater

14

offense, and that under this Court's precedent,

15

now means that I was actually charged with one

16

offense.

17

I want to be tried separately.
Well, actually, this

And so I should have had one trial.
And this Court said, no, when you made

18

the agreement to have two separate trials, you

19

should have said at that point that these might

20

be the same offense, and, actually, I want to

21

have one trial.

22

The Court said, if there is a right in

23

the background under the Double Jeopardy

24

Clause, it is the defendant's to invoke.

25

And for that reason, I think that the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
69
1

same logic would apply here.

2

Petitioner agreed to have two separate trials

3

he actually thought, well, later I would like

4

to be able to bar or limit that second trial

5

because they're, in fact, for the same offense,

6

that's my right to invoke now.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If when

What would have

8

happened here if the defendant got up and said

9

Virginia law requires separate trials.

10

-- I want what the law gives me.

11

my double jeopardy rights.

12

I won't

I won't waive

What then does the court do and what

13

then does the prosecutor do?

14

MS. ROSS:

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

MS. ROSS:

May I answer, Your Honor?
Sure.

So, if the defendant says I

17

will not waive and I want separate trials, I

18

think then the prosecution and the court would

19

have to decide sort of what -- what happens

20

going forward.

21

And the prosecution in that case would

22

have every reason to oppose severance, as I

23

think -- as I think that states and prosecutors

24

might well do going forward if -- if this case

25

comes out that way.

Thank you,

Four minutes, Mr. Fisher.

4

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

5
6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FISHER:

Thank you.

I think I

7

heard two separate ways to look at this case,

8

and I want to respond to each of them.

9

So my friend from Virginia, in

10

particular with just -- in a colloquy with

11

Justice Kagan, says the only way issue

12

preclusion works is that you invoke it at the

13

outset of the second trial and, if you cannot

14

bar the second trial at that point, it drops

15

away and the right is gone.

16

And if that is correct, then Judge -­

17

then Judge Gorsuch's opinion for the Tenth

18

Circuit in Wittig and all other eight circuits

19

we cite in Footnote 2 of our reply brief across

20

the federal court system that all understand

21

issue preclusion to depend on what happens in

22

the second trial and to only bar a particular

23

way of trying the case.

24
25

And most importantly, as Judge Gorsuch
put it for the Tenth Circuit, to sometimes

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
71
1

force courts to wait and see what happens in

2

that trial to see whether issue preclusion is

3

violated, all of that has to be wrong and it

4

would all be upended.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

But could the -- could

6

the Commonwealth have proven the second charge

7

the way that I suggested during the prior

8

argument -­

9

MR. FISHER:

10

I think perhaps -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- by making no

11

reference to the breaking and entering or the

12

larceny -­

13

MR. FISHER:

I think perhaps yes,

14

Justice Alito.

15

that.

16

try the second case in a manner that would make

17

Mr. Currier an aider, abettor, or participant

18

in the breaking and entering of which the juror

19

-- the jury convicted him.

20

And so I want to be clear about

All we're arguing is that they cannot

And so that would be a question of

21

Virginia law whether the stuff down by the

22

river would have satisfied that.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

24
25

Well, why would it not

-MR. FISHER:

But in general -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
72
1
2

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- why would it not?

It proves all the elements of the offense.

3

MR. FISHER:

Well, the way the jury

4

instructions were laid out in the -- in the -­

5

in the case, it said participate in some way in

6

the crimes of breaking and entering and the

7

theft.

8
9

And so whether handling the guns down
by the river later would be participating in

10

some way in that would be an argument the

11

parties could have.

12

But the crucial point, Justice Alito,

13

and my crucial point to the whole Court, is

14

that issue preclusion does not necessarily bar

15

a second trial.

16

And the other side doesn't dispute

17

that the test is inconsistency.

18

cannot be inconsistent.

19

right, then Wittig is wrong and all the other

20

cases across the federal courts are wrong.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

And it simply

If the government is

I think what you just

22

said, I don't want to belabor the point, but it

23

does seem to me inconsistent with the Second

24

Circuit's opinion in Kramer that you relied on

25

pretty heavily.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

73

MR. FISHER:

I'll just say not at all.

2

I just would urge the Court to reread that

opinion.

opinion.

We're exactly on all fours with that

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

6

MR. FISHER:

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

No, I read it.

They sent it back down -­
But you could have -­

8

they could have proven the -- the -- the second

9

offense without making any reference to what

10

had happened in the other -- in the other

11

offense.

12

MR. FISHER:

Which is why Judge

13

Friendly does not bar a second trial and sends

14

certain cases back for retrial with the

15

government simply not being able to introduce

16

certain evidence -­

17
18

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Mr. Fisher, what's

your second point?

19

MR. FISHER:

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. FISHER:

Thank you.

Thank you.

My -- my second point is

22

that the other thing that, particularly the

23

Solicitor General, the argument they make, is

24

that the government has a right, so to speak,

25

to try all of its counts at once, just like in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
74
1

Powell.

2

And so my answer to that is that

3

argument simply is exactly the same argument

4

the Court rejected in Yeager.

5

Court said if the government comes forward and

6

says we want to try all these counts, but then,

7

through no fault of its own, is unable to reach

8

a verdict on particular counts, but a jury

9

comes back and acquits in a manner that we can

In Yeager, the

10

say resolves certain issues of ultimate fact

11

against the prosecution, the square holding of

12

Yeager, which is -- rejects the exact argument

13

you just heard, is that issue preclusion

14

applies in those circumstances.

15

And there's a good reason why it

16

applies.

17

preclusion and the Court's whole double

18

jeopardy jurisprudence that we've been talking

19

about today is to let the defendant have a fair

20

trial and not be tried twice for the same

21

thing, but also to allow the prosecution one

22

full and fair opportunity to prove all of its

23

allegations.

24
25

One way to think about issue

And so, in all the Jeffers-style
cases, that's what the prosecution would be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
75
1

deprived of and why the Court has not allowed

2

the Double Jeopardy Clause to be invoked.

3

In this case, just like in Yeager, the

4

only thing that's being prevented is the

5

prosecution having a second bite at the apple

6

as to particular allegations.

7

and I'll just return to my colloquy with

8

Justice Alito when I -- to -- to conclude, it

9

can even allow the second trial to go forward,

10

just simply in a manner that doesn't allow the

11

prosecution functionally to try the defendant

12

for the same offense twice.

It can even -­

13

And so, if you believe the postulates

14

that inconsistency is the test and that Wittig

15

and all the other cases we have cited are

16

correct, it leads inequitably to our

17

conclusion.

18

is enough, then the equities in the case and

19

the competing interests and the right to the

20

inviolacy of an acquittal should persuade you

21

to -- to reverse the judgment below.

22
23

If there's any more questions, I'm
happy to answer them.

And even if you don't believe that
