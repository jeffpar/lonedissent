Mr. Waxman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

11

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
When a defendant maintains his

12

innocence and insists on testing the

13

prosecution on its burden of proof, the

14

Constitution prohibits a trial court from

15

permitting the defendant's own lawyer, over the

16

defendant's objection, to tell the jury that he

17

is guilty.

18

The Sixth Amendment guarantees a

19

personal defense that belongs to the accused,

20

and whether to admit or contest guilt is the

21

paradigmatic example of that personal defense,

22

not only because it singularly affects the life

23

and liberty of the accused, but also because

24

making that decision requires weighing

25

subjective aspirations and value judgments that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

1

are unique to every individual.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How -­
Suppose the -­

3

the charge is murder and -- and the lawyer

4

says:

5

your best case is self-defense, you know.

6

-- and the other guy's -- the defendant says:

7

No, I didn't shoot the person.

8

says:

9

show that you did, self-defense.

Based on what I've looked -- I think
And

And the lawyer

10

Well, I think the evidence is going to

If the lawyer goes ahead and presents

11

that defense, is -- does that fall under your

12

theory?

13

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, I

14

think your question raises a question both of

15

what defense counsel may constitutionally do

16

and also what defense counsel may not

17

constitutionally do.

18

I'll also note first that your

19

hypothetical, in dramatic contrast to this

20

case, involves, at a minimum, the shared

21

objective of obtaining a -- an acquittal on the

22

charged crimes.

23

But, in addition, our position is that

24

the one thing that counsel in that case and in

25

no case may do is -- this isn't about what

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
5
1

counsel can argue.

It's not about what

2

evidence can be introduced.

3

may not stand up and affirmatively vouch, admit

4

that his client is guilty.

It's that counsel

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. WAXMAN:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. WAXMAN:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

That was -­

Now, your example -­
-- a big -­

Yes.
-- that was a

big wind-up with the -­

11

MR. WAXMAN:

That's a -­

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But my

13

particular question is obviously, when you say

14

simply that my client shot the guy, that

15

doesn't mean he's guilty.

16

self-defense, he's not guilty.

17

defense is it was self-defense.

18

MR. WAXMAN:

If he did it in
And then the
So -­

That's right.

So

19

recognizing that that is not this case, our

20

position is -- and I think the framers utterly

21

would agree -- that if a defendant stands up

22

and says, look, I did not shoot that guy, as

23

Mr. McCoy said, I did not kill my own family

24

members and I do not want my lawyer standing up

25

and telling the jury that I did -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

2

MR. WAXMAN:

3
4

Okay.

So -­

-- that is for the

defendant -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- your

5

position is not -- your position is not limited

6

to the situation where the lawyer admits the

7

client's guilt; it goes beyond that?

8
9

MR. WAXMAN:

We -- that's a

hypothetical, and our position is that the

10

framers -- that the -- that the meaning of the

11

Sixth Amendment, the meaning of the right to

12

defend, that the framers enshrined, that is

13

recognized in all common law jurisdictions, is

14

that if the defendant contests and decides to

15

put the prosecution to its proof beyond a

16

reasonable doubt as to an element of the

17

offense, particularly at the actus reus, the

18

Constitution precludes the defense -- his own

19

lawyer from telling the jury -­

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

MR. WAXMAN:

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

Any element -­

-- that he did it.
-- any element

of the offense?

24

MR. WAXMAN:

So -­

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Offenses have

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

a lot of -- I mean, some -- is venue an element

2

of an offense sometimes?

3

MR. WAXMAN:

Or -­

Well, the -- the most

4

extreme hypothetical I can think of is:

Was

5

there a mailing in interstate commerce?

And -­

6
7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

All right.

Well, that's a good one.

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. WAXMAN:

Thank you.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

MR. WAXMAN:

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is that -­

I think -­
-- is that -­

13

I mean, the Hobbs Act or something?

14

cross -- cross state lines?

15

MR. WAXMAN:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

Did you

So -­
That's an

element of the offense.

18

MR. WAXMAN:

Yeah.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, if a

20

lawyer says it's obvious that you did cross

21

state lines, you've got 48 witnesses, I'm not

22

going to argue that you didn't cross state

23

lines; and the person says that's an element of

24

the offense, you have to say I didn't or

25

withdraw.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

MR. WAXMAN:

No, no, no.

You don't -­

2

the -- the client doesn't get to decide what

3

you will affirmatively say.

4

say, even if it's just an element of the

5

offense -­

6

The client can

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

So the

7

lawyer gets up, look, they've got to prove

8

these things.

9

clearly proved, but we want to talk about these

Crossing state lines, that's

10

other things.

11

fundamental right?

12

So that violates this

MR. WAXMAN:

Just so that we're -- you

13

and I are very clear about this, we don't think

14

that this case presents the question because

15

this is a case in which -- in which there was

16

not an agreement on whether to pursue

17

acquittal.

18

strategy, about how to be acquitted of murder.

19

And that's a huge difference, and our

This wasn't a disagreement about

20

position in this case only depends on that.

21

But the logic I -­

22
23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, I know.

You -- you know how hypotheticals work.

24

MR. WAXMAN:

I do.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This is a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
9
1

different case.

2

that I understand that your position is that

3

the lawyer cannot vouch for any element of the

4

defense, not just that, you know, it was

5

self-defense, not that you didn't shoot him,

6

all that, but any element of an offense, if the

7

lawyer tells the jury that that's satisfied

8

contrary to the client's wishes, that violates

9

the -­

10

And I just want to make sure

MR. WAXMAN:

Our position is that the

11

defense that the framers enshrined in the Sixth

12

Amendment and that is recognized in the entire

13

rest of the common law world is that, whether

14

it's admitting guilt or not, if the defendant

15

says I did not do X, I did not kill my parents

16

-- my family members, defense counsel may not

17

affirmatively tell the jury that he did and ask

18

that he be required to spend the rest of his

19

life in prison.

20
21
22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, then that's the

problem.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So I did not

23

-- I did not cross the Pennsylvania state line

24

in the course of committing this crime.

25

MR. WAXMAN:

That's right.

The

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

defense lawyer doesn't have to say to the

2

jury -- he doesn't have to say one word about

3

crossing state lines.

4

What he can't say is:

I am telling

5

you that Mr. McCoy killed these three family

6

members.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Your answer is that -­

8

this is fairly simple.

9

attorney cannot concede any element of the

10

The -- the defense

defense -- of -- of the offense.

11

MR. WAXMAN:

If there is a

12

contemporaneous objection, the trial court may

13

not permit the defense lawyer to admit any

14

element of the offense.

15

That's -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

problem.

17

mind.

Right there is the

I mean, that's the problem in my

18

Faretta itself poses a problem because

19

a large percentage of the people that insist on

20

representing themselves, particularly in death

21

cases, are going to walk right into the death

22

-- the death chamber.

23

there are just not really capable of managing

24

their own defense.

25

A lot of the people

So now we have a lawyer.

And,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
11
1

suddenly, we come in with a constitutional rule

2

that's going to tell the lawyer how to argue

3

his case.

4

The people who know this are the trial bar, if

5

anybody.

6

cases where, in fact, to make a sensible

7

defense for this person who might have one, the

8

lawyer has to say to the jury, because of what

9

other witnesses have said and so forth, that

10
11

How do I know what you say is true?

But how do you know whether there are

letter did cross state lines?
And if we agree with you in this,

12

which is a very different case, the argument

13

against agreeing with you in this is it will be

14

like a balloon expanding into we don't know

15

where what, because they're filled with

16

elements, the federal code.

17

know it, lawyers will have a hard time

18

defending this person.

19

right into jail when you start telling your

20

lawyer how to run his case.

21

And before you

And you're walking

Now, that's the concern that I think

22

is there in the Chief's question.

23

would like to know your response to what I

24

consider a very practical concern.

25

MR. WAXMAN:

And I -- I

My response, as Your

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1

Honor's question noted, is there is -- there is

2

no need for this Court to decide the elements

3

question or any other hypothetical in which

4

there is a shared objective of acquittal in

5

order to decide this case.

6

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

7

MR. WAXMAN:

8

Well -­

My position with respect

--

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

MR. WAXMAN:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's surprising.

-- my -- excuse me?
That's -- that's

12

surprising, because if we announce that we're

13

not deciding it, there are like 200,000

14

criminal cases in the lower courts and there

15

will be a kind of chaos, I mean, I fear, that

16

as to what -- there are lots of people, you

17

know, there are many, many defendants who go

18

through dozens of lawyers while they're

19

objecting to this one or that one or the other

20

one.

21

MR. WAXMAN:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

Justice Breyer -­
And you see what I'm

worried about?

24

MR. WAXMAN:

I -­

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think we should

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1

decide it.

2

MR. WAXMAN:

Okay.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

MR. WAXMAN:

I -­

But -- yeah.

-- I invite you to decide

5

it.

It will be dicta, but I invite you to

6

state what the logic is.

7

And our position is simply this:

We

8

are talking about the defense that was

9

enshrined in the Sixth Amendment, and there is

10

no contest from the state about the

11

contemporary understanding of this at the time.

12

But if -­

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But, Mr. Waxman, if

14

we have to draw a line, it seems to me we have

15

at least two axes we have to worry about.

16

is, where do we stop on the concession?

17

say it goes down to elements.

18

One
You

I -- I -- I press you why it wouldn't

19

go further than that, if the client instructs

20

the lawyer not to accede to admission of a

21

piece of evidence as particularly damning but

22

the lawyer sees no good faith basis for

23

objecting.

24

MR. WAXMAN:

So -­

25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

-- why -- why

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

doesn't it go down to that level?

2

axis.

3

MR. WAXMAN:

4

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

That's one

The -­
The other axis would

5

be you say it's -- the lawyer can't admit the

6

element.

7

the element?

8

hadn't admitted guilt but had presented a mens

9

rea defense that really cast aspersions on the

But what if the lawyer casts doubt on
I mean, what if the lawyer here

10

actus reus defense, right, it really cast -­

11

any reasonable person would know what the

12

lawyer is up to.

13

"I admit," but he did, in fact, essentially do

14

that.

15
16
17

He didn't use the magic words

So we have ambiguity on both these
axes.

Where would we draw the lines?
MR. WAXMAN:

So I think this Court has

18

been -- as to your first axis, the Court has

19

been very, very clear that decisions, once a -­

20

once a defendant chooses to be represented by

21

counsel, decisions about what evidence to

22

admit, what objections to raise, what witnesses

23

to call, with the exception of the defendant,

24

and what witnesses not to call and what

25

arguments to be made are for the lawyer,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

reviewable if at all under the ineffective

2

assistance of counsel defense.

3

So evidence, arguments, witnesses,

4

this case is only about -- and you say there's

5

a small difference, but this is all the

6

difference in the world.

7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But sometimes -­

8

sometimes -- sometimes, though, a piece of

9

evidence is far more important than an element.

10

Take -- take the Chief Justice's example of a

11

Hobbs Act.

12

element is usually not that big a deal in those

13

cases.

14

you know, an admission by the defendant is a

15

huge deal.

16

I mean, the interstate commerce

But admission of a piece, a letter or,

MR. WAXMAN:

I mean, in the real

17

world, what defendants object to -- and I've

18

been representing death row inmates for -­

19

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

20

MR. WAXMAN:

I know.

-- this is my 40th year

21

-- defendants are not drawing a line and saying

22

you can't admit that something moved in

23

interstate commerce across state lines.

24

they are concerned about and what they have an

25

-- an autonomy, dignitary right to have

Heritage Reporting Corporation

What

Official
16
1

protected is I didn't do this, I didn't commit

2

the actus reus.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Waxman, may I

4

-- may I ask if we -- if we concede the general

5

proposition that you're right, the client has a

6

right to say I didn't do it, but that's a

7

defense.

8

to make out that defense, the lawyer says I

9

can't present that because you say there are

And what the client wants to put on

10

witnesses, I've talked to the witnesses, they

11

say the opposite.

12

I can't put on the defense.

So if -- if -- take this very case.

13

So the lawyer can't say:

14

three people.

15

how -- how does the lawyer back up that

16

defense, I didn't do it, when, in the lawyer's

17

view, there is no basis for taking that

18

position?

19

My client shot these

But then what?

MR. WAXMAN:

What -- what -­

Justice Ginsburg, the

20

defendants, and even clients in civil cases,

21

all the time do things that make counsel's job

22

either difficult or impossible.

23

The defendant can say:

Look, I don't

24

care, I am going to testify and I am going to

25

give my side of the story, or I don't care,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1

I've instructed all of my family members not to

2

talk to you, not to provide you any

3

information.

4

The lawyer's professional

5

responsibility, nonetheless, is just exactly

6

how Justice White explained it at pages 257 and

7

258 of his opinion in United States versus

8

Wade.

9

What happens in these cases is that

10

the lawyer doesn't have -- the -- the principle

11

at stake here is not in any way a restriction

12

on how the lawyer presents evidence, what

13

defenses he actually does present, how he goes

14

about cross-examining witnesses.

22

this alibi that is inherently incredible.

What

23

does the lawyer do?

24

the client in making out the defense that the

25

client has chosen?

How does the lawyer assist

Heritage Reporting Corporation

18
1

MR. WAXMAN:

The -- the lawyer will

2

cross-examine the government's witnesses, as

3

Justice White explained, attempting to find

4

holes in their testimony even if the lawyer

5

believes that they are testifying truthfully.

6

That is the hallmark of the adversary

7

system.

And although it is not this case,

8

because Mr. English testified repeatedly under

9

oath that -- that his client's belief that he

10

was not there and he did not do this was

11

sincere -- sincerely reflected his

12

understanding, even if he thought that Mr.

defense is going to be able to convince a jury

14

that the defendant did not commit the actus

15

reus, but there's a plausible defense, maybe a

16

pretty good defense, on mens rea.

17

So -- but the client insists:

I

18

didn't do it, I did not commit the actus reus.

19

Now, two ways of -- of approaching this on the

20

part of the defendant -- defense attorney, and

21

I want you to explain whether one is required

22

or whether -- whether both are permissible or

23

only one is permissible.

24

One is for the attorney to concede in

25

the opening, yes, he committed the actus reus,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

but there's a good mens rea defense, and

2

develop that.

3
4

I take it you would say that's not
permissible?

5

MR. WAXMAN:

Correct.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

But could the attorney

7

open by saying:

Now, they have to prove he

8

committed certain acts but also that he had a

9

certain mental state, and our defense here is

10

going to be that he didn't have the requisite

11

mental state, and everything that's done during

12

the trial is directed toward that.

13

attempt to put the government to its proof, to

14

try to poke holes in the witnesses who are

15

going to be called to establish the actus reus.

16

Is the latter permitted?

17

MR. WAXMAN:

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

There's no

So the latter -­
So long as he doesn't

19

say the magic words he actually committed the

20

-- the -- the physical acts charged, it's okay?

21

MR. WAXMAN:

Right.

22

may or may not be okay.

23

about this.

The core -- it

Let me be very clear

24

The core Sixth Amendment right that is

25

at issue here is where a defendant says this is

a personal defense, I can make my own value

2

judgments about whether I do or do not want to

3

-- to take a minuscule chance of not being

convicted and spending a life in -- in prison.

prohibits the lawyer from affirmatively telling

the jury:

right at issue here, and your -­

where the line is.

JUSTICE ALITO:

So the line -­
What is the answer to

my question?
MR. WAXMAN:

Yes, the answer to your

question is, if I understood your hypothetical

Heritage Reporting Corporation

correctly, there would not be a violation of

2

this fundamental Sixth Amendment right and the

3

defense counsel's strategy in focusing the jury

on mens rea and saying nothing or

12

evidence in this case that is going to convince

13

you that even if you find that the defendant

14

committed these murders, he did not act with

15

the requisite mens rea.

16

I am going to introduce

JUSTICE BREYER:

That -- that's easy

17

for you to say in a case that you're imagining.

18

What I'm wondering, if there are other cases

19

where it might be far more difficult to come up

20

with that answer, and, therefore, I'm asking

21

you this question:

22

say in this case the lawyer explicitly said to

23

the jury he is guilty of the crime charged.

24

That the Sixth Amendment forbids.

25

Suppose the opinion were to

But the rest of these complicated

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
26
1

matters, whether it's elements, whether it's

2

this, whether it's that, we leave -- at least

3

for now, we leave to the law schools, the bars,

4

the ethics classes and the others because we

5

don't want to freeze the answer into the Sixth

6

Amendment.

7

Now, what would you think of that?

8

MR. WAXMAN:

9

I think that the only

holding that this Court can apply in this case

10

is that under the -- that where -- was Your

11

Honor's hypothetical -- was Your Honor's

12

statement of the case, which is where the

13

defendant says, and says to the judge, promptly

14

and repeatedly:

15

my family, my lawyer wants to stand up and tell

16

the jury that I did and that I am guilty, and

17

the judge -- if the judge says you're the

18

lawyer, you decide, that is a violation of the

19

Sixth Amendment and the due process clause.

22

I did not kill the members of

-­

you back to the Chief Justice's question?

24

Because here we do have a case where the

25

2

3

I didn't kill my

You can't say I killed my family.
But there are different levels of

4

generality, right?

5

didn't kill my family.

6

you can't say that I committed the actus reus

7

no matter what the actus reus is.

8

is you can't say that I committed any element

9

of the offense, actus reus or otherwise.

10

One is you can't say that I
One is you -- you -­

And another

And if I understood your argument,

11

you're saying that the logic of your position

12

takes you from this case, which is an actus

13

reus of killing, to any actus reus and then

14

further from there to any element.

15

And I guess I wonder, why is it that

16

the logic of your position insists that we go

17

up that chain?

18

MR. WAXMAN:

I don't think the logic

19

of my position insists that you go all the way

20

up the chain, but I'll explain to you why I

21

think the better view would stop at

22

affirmatively admitting -- nothing about what

23

the trial -- how the trial is conducted, but

24

affirmatively admitting any element.

25

And it -- it simply goes back to my

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
28
1

reading and my understanding -- maybe I'm wrong

2

-- of the rule that existed, the law that

3

existed at the time the Sixth Amendment was

4

considered and adopted and what the framers

5

must have understood.

6

And we -- we go over this at some

7

length in our brief.

There's no controversion

about this.

18th century in England and common law

I think that at the time in the

10

jurisdictions and at the time of the framing of

11

the Sixth Amendment, the frame -- people would

12

have been astonished, as the -- as the amicus

13

brief of the bar of England and Wales

14

expresses, that the notion that the defendant

15

could say this is my defense and my decision to

16

contest this invokes my own subjective

17

judgments about what is important to me and

18

what is not important to me, that it would be

question about it, but the -- the right to the

defense are not mutually exclusive rights.

25

Justice Alito, and then, if I may, I'd like to

save some time for rebuttal.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, in -- when the

Sixth Amendment was adopted, there was not a

somebody in Mr. English's position would simply

say:

that you want to put on.

quickly or go ahead without an attorney.

I agree.
-- how much you can

read into the -- into the original

understanding because the situation here is

there is the right to have an appointed

attorney.

MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Alito, Daniel

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH MURRILL,

SOLICITOR GENERAL OF LOUISIANA,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

7
8

MS. MURRILL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

9

The state proposes a -- a rule that,

10

in a narrow class of death penalty classes,

11

counsel sometimes might be required to override

12

his client on a trial strategy when the

13

strategy that the -- that the client wants

14

counsel to pursue is a futile charade and

15

requires him to defeat both their objectives of

16

defeating the death penalty.

17

We submit that that should be treated

18

as a Strickland ineffective assistance of

Because I think we've

5

in most cases that the rules of professional

6

conduct would dictate that a lawyer follow the

Is it the rules of

professional conduct or is it the Sixth

The Sixth Amendment requires you to

Or do you concede that generally or

14

all the time -- let's not say this is a death

15

case, let's just say this was a robbery case,

16

all right?

17

A robbery case.

I wasn't the

18

robber.

English did:

20

he didn't intend to force -- to use force.

21

Can the lawyer come in and do what Mr.
Yes, he was the robber, but, no,

MS. MURRILL:

I think that the rules

22

of professional conduct inform the Sixth

23

Amendment and that they would probably give

24

some level of greater force to the client's

25

wishes in certain situations, but, again, I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
33
1

think that goes back to Strickland.

2

It's in -- if you -- if you evaluate

3

it as a Strickland claim, then we're looking at

4

it under the first prong of Strickland as a

5

question of deficiency.

7

it's a Sixth Amendment violation?

So, if the agency

11

has ended because the client has said:

do this, how can it not be a violation of the

13

Sixth Amendment to do it?

14

MS. MURRILL:

15

principles only take us so far.

16

even the ABA standards on -- on criminal

defense standards don't suggest that they do,

that -- that agency principles, especially in a

19

20

Because agency
And because

And that if -- if we -- if we look at

the alter ego of the client, but I think -­

your point.

Your point -- I see

Normally, these are questions of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

the bar rules of -- rules of ethics for lawyers

2

and so forth.

Normally, they do what the

3

client says.

That's the normal situation.

4

Right here, it was pretty clear that

Maybe many are

The ethics rules don't

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, but you just said

client.

23

obviously, in fact, about the case is the

24

extent to which it's fed into the Sixth

25

Amendment, because there's so many different

I mean, that's what's worrying me,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
36

situations.

2

But if anything is fed into the Sixth

3

Amendment, I would think the example of the

4

lawyer going in against his wishes and saying

5

he is guilty of the crime charged, which is

6

basically what happened, that that might or

7

must.

8
9

MS. MURRILL:

Well, Your Honor, I

mean, I think the state has been -- been very

10

clear that we think that the -- the defense

11

that Mr. McCoy wanted was inextricably

12

intertwined with the alibi that Mr. McCoy

13

wanted, that it was not purely a questionable

14

--

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah.

But they're

16

not saying about what you have to put on or not

17

put on.

18

Amendment says you can't go to the jury and

19

say, as this lawyer did, my client is guilty of

20

the crime charged.

21

They're just saying the Sixth

Now -- now, that's the extreme case

22

that's put to us.

23

the Sixth Amendment?

24
25

Now why doesn't that violate

MS. MURRILL:

Because, at the end of

the day, it leaves him with a less -- less of a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
37

defense, a less -- the defense is not as

2

strong.

It is a weaker defense.

3

He has not waived his right to

4

counsel.

He hasn't waived the remedy of

5

ineffective assistance of counsel.

6
7

And so he's -- he's -- he is tying his
counsel's hands.

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, for sure we've

given lawyers a lot of leeway to make quite a

10

number of decisions when they're representing a

11

defendant, troubled and untroubled, and the

12

idea is that lawyers know better, sometimes,

13

than their clients and that we should want to

14

lodge a great many strategic decisions in their

15

hands rather than in the client's.

16

But you're not talking about here, or

17

we're not talking about here, about how to

18

pursue a set of objectives.

19

pursue it this way or is it better to pursue it

20

that way?

21

Is it better to

We're talking about a client saying:

22

You have to follow -- I have -- I have an

23

overriding objective in this case, and that's

24

to avoid the opprobrium that comes with

25

admitting that I killed family members.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official
38
1

that's my overriding objective.

2

And you're saying that the lawyer can

3

say it doesn't matter that that's your

4

overriding objective.

5

to know is why.

6

MS. MURRILL:

And I guess what I want

Well, because -- first,

7

Your Honor, I -- I don't think that that's

8

entirely how Mr. McCoy characterized his

9

objective.

I -- I would describe it more as

10

though he said I know a better way to cross

11

this divide and we're going to cross it by

12

letting me drive the -- this car over the cliff

13

because the car will fly.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But he didn't say

15

that.

He said, and I think this much is clear

16

from the record, he said in no uncertain terms:

17

I do not want to concede that I killed these

18

three people.

19

MS. MURRILL:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

He wasn't talking

21

about strategy at that time.

He just said I do

22

not want to concede that I killed these people.

23

I think we -- we've heard that -- that

24

-- from Mr. Waxman, a lawyer can't make that

25

concession, but the lawyer doesn't have to do

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
39
1

anything else.

2

let the client get on the stand and tell

3

whatever story the client wants to tell.

4

They can just stand there and

MS. MURRILL:

No, Your Honor.

I mean,

5

I don't think that we -- I think that the

6

problem that that presents is that the lawyer

7

is now less effective than he could be,

8

especially in a case like this when -- and -­

9

and we will -- I will give Mr. English the

10

benefit of the doubt that he did not believe

11

that his client was going to lie and yet he

12

believed the alibi was entirely falsified.

13

So he -- he's giving him the benefit

14

of the doubt.

He -- he believed his client was

15

delusional.

16

it, but his ultimate objective, his ultimate

his client, to defeat the death penalty, and to

21

save his life.

And -- and so that does bring into
It doesn't really

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

But -­

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But the client is

24

saying that -- that his ultimate objective is

25

not to defeat the death penalty.

In other

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
40
1

words, you just have conflicting objectives.

2

I mean, I totally understand that this

3

lawyer was in a terrible position because this

4

lawyer wants to defeat the death penalty.

5

he has a client who says:

6

here.

7

And

That's not my goal

But the question is, when that

8

happens, does the lawyer have to step back and

9

say:

You know what?

That's not his goal.

His

10

goal is to avoid admitting that he killed his

11

family members.

12

MS. MURRILL:

Well, and so, if that's

13

all he had said and that was the totality of

14

the circumstances, was I don't want to admit

15

that, and it was -- it was a rational, fine

16

discussion, I don't want to admit that, I don't

17

want everybody to hear that, that's fine.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

MS. MURRILL:

When we got to this -­
That's not what

JUSTICE ALITO:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

He -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- the situation here

24

occurred.

It's an extreme situation, and a -­

25

and a difficult one -- but it -- it only

Heritage Reporting Corporation

41
1

occurred because of a number of prior steps,

2

many of which I think are debatable.

3

One, the -- the -- the decision that

4

McCoy is competent to handle -- to stand trial.

5

The second, the -- the judge's ruling,

6

I understand the reason, that English couldn't

7

withdraw.

8

a continuance so that McCoy could find another

9

attorney, if he could find one who would put on

The decision that there couldn't be

10

his far-fetched alibi defense.

11

refusal to waive his right to counsel and

12

represent himself.

13

And McCoy's

Now, if any of those had gone

14

differently, the situation wouldn't have been

15

presented.

16

about the issue of competence and allowing

17

English to withdraw?

18

So what about the issue of -- what

If a -- if somebody like McCoy really

19

sincerely believes that he did not commit these

20

physical acts, but it was all done by -- as

21

part of an elaborate conspiracy, is he -- is he

22

capable of assisting in his own defense?

23

MS. MURRILL:

Your Honor, that's a

24

very difficult question.

I -- I agree it's a

25

very tough question, and I think it is a -- it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
42
1

is a question in tension in this case, but it's

2

not the question that was presented.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

Wasn't -- wasn't

there -­

5

MS. MURRILL:

And -- and so the

6

question is really about counsel -­

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Wasn't there a

8

motion -- there was a determination that he was

9

competent to stand trial?

10

MS. MURRILL:

There -- there was a

11

determination that he was competent.

12

a subsequent review of that determination on

13

the motion for new trial by the trial judge,

14

and there was a third review of that decision

15

by the Louisiana Supreme Court.

16
17
18
19
20

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

There was

If I

could -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

The -- the lawyer put

on a defense?
JUSTICE ALITO:

-- just move on to the

21

-- the other part of it.

So, if English says

22

to the judge, look, Your Honor, I can't be part

23

of -- and I don't want to be part of this

24

farce, it -- and this farce that has the

25

predictable result of sending this -- my client

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
43
1

to a death sentence, I want to withdraw, why

2

shouldn't the judge let him withdraw?

3

MS. MURRILL:

Perhaps he should at a

4

certain point in time, but I think that's a

5

limited right in and of itself and -- and that

6

the judge has to make that decision based on an

7

abuse of -- and that's an abuse of discretion

8

standard.

9

case too.

10

And -- and that was raised in this

So, I mean, maybe that would have been

11

an answer.

12

right time and under the right circumstances.

13

I think it has to happen at the

JUSTICE BREYER:

Would the lawyer -­

14

did -- did his lawyer put on a defense?

15

conceded that -- he didn't fight the

16

competence.

17

the defendant was not competent at the time of

18

the murder, that his -- that his mental state

19

was such that he couldn't be convicted?

20

He

But did he put on a defense that

MS. MURRILL:

The entire tenor of his

21

defense was to attack mens rea and then

22

subsequently to beg for mercy in the -- the

23

penalty phase if there was -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

To attack mens rea on

the ground that it was not -- he was not

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

mentally competent at that time?

2

MS. MURRILL:

Yes, Your Honor, that he

3

didn't have the capacity to develop the

4

specific intent of -­

5

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Counsel, you've been

6

asking us to review this under Strickland, but

7

why -- why isn't this a structural error?

8

Sixth Amendment guarantees the assistance of

9

counsel, as Mr. Waxman points out, and that is

The

10

a fiduciary relationship.

11

doesn't just admit an element but admits guilt

12

of second-degree murder, which is effectively

13

what happened here, why isn't that structural

14

error, a total denial of assistance of counsel,

15

absence of an assistance of counsel, that we

16

should take cognizance of and draw the line

17

there?

18

MS. MURRILL:

And when someone

Your Honor, first of

19

all, because I don't think it fits within the

20

class of cases that have been evaluated as

21

Cronic, to complete failure of adversarial

22

testing -­

23

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, why -- why

24

isn't this just like Faretta, where we said,

25

you know, that you have a right to have

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

assistance of counsel and not to have an agent

2

of the state assist the state in prosecuting

3

you?

4

MS. MURRILL:

Well, initially, because

5

I would suggest to you it was not a -- he was

6

not an agent of the state.

7

counsel of choice.

8
9

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

He was Mr. McCoy's

You'd agree, though,

that he -- he effectively conceded guilt to

10

second-degree murder?

11

MS. MURRILL:

As a strategy and a

12

means of defeating the death penalty and

13

testing the state's case on specific intent.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, I

15

thought it's been not disputed that he thought,

16

quite wrongly, that there was no mens rea for

17

second-degree murder but that it's been

18

conceded that what -- there -- that there was a

19

mens rea both for first and second degree and

20

he was only arguing for second degree?

21

MS. MURRILL:

Your Honor, on the facts

22

of this case, he was arguing for second degree.

23

Louisiana law does permit -- does -- does cover

24

-- felony murder is not a specific intent to

25

kill, but that was really never at issue in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
46
1

this case.

2
3

It was charged as a second degree.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

there is a mens rea for second degree murder.

4

MS. MURRILL:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

MS. MURRILL:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

I'm sorry, but

There is, yes.
And so -­

Yeah, I mean, I -­
-- you concede

that there wasn't second degree?

9

MS. MURRILL:

I think that that was a

10

strategy decision that falls under the first

11

prong of Strickland.

12

in fact, the wrong decision, then it would

13

still -- would fail, potentially, the first

14

prong of Strickland, and then we would go to

15

the second, but I think that does go back to

16

Strickland and most -- all of the questions

17

about how he did, what he did, and the choices

18

that he made, ultimately, I think, fall under

19

the first point.

20

And -- and if that was,

JUSTICE BREYER:

And that's -- I now

21

understand why we are where we are.

The -­

22

that in this case, he did not, the lawyer,

23

concede that his client was guilty of the crime

24

charged.

25

had shot the people, killed the people, but

Rather, he said he conceded that he

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
47
1

he's not guilty because of his state of mind.

2

So it's a question of the defense.

3

That's why he started with elements and so

4

forth.

5

that.

You have to go down some road like

6

MS. MURRILL:

Yes.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

And so

8

your view is that even here, where he's saying

9

I did this thing, but I didn't have the mental

10

element -- I did this thing -- the client says

11

don't say I did this thing, and that's the

12

problem and -- okay, I've got the problem.

13

Sorry.

14

but -­

15

I should have it before now, but -­

MS. MURRILL:

I -- Justice Breyer, I

16

think -- I think that you captured where the

17

state is when you said let's -- don't freeze

18

that answer into the Sixth Amendment.

19

--

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's

Well, what's your -­

21

what's -- that's fine to say in abstract terms,

22

but -- but -- but our problem, I think, at

23

least mine, is I have to write something -­

24

(Laughter.)

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- here that is going

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
48
1
2

to be taken as a rather authoritative account.
Now, what is your view as to what

3

those words should be?

4

anything, the lawyer, no matter how

5

incriminating it is to the client as long as he

6

says I want to follow a different defense, a

7

different defense than my client wants?

8

your view of it?

9

That he can do

That's

And leave the rest to the -- to

10

Strickland, the bar association, et cetera.

11

that your view?

12

MS. MURRILL:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14
15

Well, then I -- I -­
What is your view, if

you can say it in a sentence or two?
MS. MURRILL:

That in a very narrow

16

class of death penalty cases, counsel may be

17

required to override the decision of his

18

client, if that's -- if -- if the client's

19

strategy is -- is futile and -­

20

Is

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, if -- if we're

21

there, though, in Strickland, even in

22

Strickland, on deficient performance, why isn't

23

there at least deficient performance here by

24

the lawyer admitting the element as opposed to

25

remaining mute about it?

That would have been

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
49
1

an option that I think the lawyer could have

2

pursued.

3

So we'd still have prejudice prong, I

4

understand your arguments there, but why not on

5

deficient performance?

6

under the ethical rules, which I know are not

7

controlling here, that you -- you would have

8

had an argument for an ethical violation in

9

conceding your client's guilt.

10

MS. MURRILL:

I would have thought

And -- and I would

11

expect them to make that argument.

12

reserved their Strickland claims.

13

reserved them before the Louisiana Supreme

14

Court.

15

subsequent post-conviction review proceedings.

16

And they have expressly reserved them in their

17

proceedings here.

18

They've
They

They can bring those claims in

So I would suggest that it would not

19

be appropriate to pretermit that inquiry, that

20

a state court should make that decision, and

21

that those are factual findings that need to be

22

made.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But not if this is

24

a case that comes under Cronic.

If it's -- if

25

it's a Cronic case, as Mr. Waxman urged that it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

is, then there's no Strickland analysis,

2

there's no prejudice inquiry; it's just

right is violated, not -­

MS. MURRILL:

And -- and so, Justice

Ginsburg, I would suggest that the Sixth

Why isn't that a Cronic error?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

He

Is -- maybe

10

this is the same question Justice Kennedy was

11

getting at, but what if there was a discussion

12

before and the client told the lawyer:

13

understand you think you're doing your job

14

keeping me from the death sentence, but I don't

15

want -- it's worse for me to spend the rest of

16

my life in jail, that's my perspective, so I

17

don't want you to pursue your objective of

So I

He said I've got this -- and so, if

that's not the case, I don't want to make it an

21

easier case on second degree.

22

is to defeat first-degree murder and here's how

23

I'm going to do it; so you cannot stand up and

say that he's -- he's guilty because that's

25

just getting me life in prison and that's

Our only chance

worse.

2

And the lawyer -- does the lawyer then

3

still have the -- the right to pursue his

4

strategy?

5

I'm going to tell you he's guilty, but he

6

doesn't have the mens rea?

7

Still has the right to say:

MS. MURRILL:

Yes,

I think in that -- I

8

think at the -- in that situation, you probably

9

are going to fail the deficiency prong of

10
11

Strickland and probably the prejudice prong.
And -- and you are, in your

hypothetical, talking about a rational

conversation with someone who's cooperative.

subpoena David Vitter, Senator David Vitter,

So the further -­

-- that I wasn't -- that

I was in Houston.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So the further

24

footnote is it's -- only happens if your

client's not rational, that that's where you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
54
1

have the freedom to ignore your client?

2

MS. MURRILL:

No, Your Honor.

I think

3

that -- I think that our rule, by placing it

4

under Strickland, falls within the -- the -­

5

the principles that have been applied by state

6

courts over and over again that you look at the

7

totality of the circumstances, that the rules

8

of ethics and norms of practice do inform

9

counsel's judgment, and that in most cases you

10

would validate the decision of the client.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Ms. Murrill, I -­

12

I think all these questions go to the same

13

point, which is Strickland seems a very awkward

14

fit here because there's nothing wrong with

15

what this lawyer did if the goal is avoiding

16

the death penalty.

17

the best thing, the thing that a good lawyer

18

would do if the goal were avoiding the death

19

penalty.

20

This lawyer probably did

The problem that this case presents is

21

something different.

It's the lawyer's

22

substitution of his goal of avoiding the death

23

penalty for the client's goal, as the Chief

24

Justice said, I don't care about that.

25

want to avoid the death penalty.

I don't

I -- I -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
55

that's not my paramount goal.

My paramount

2

goal is to insist until my last breath that I

3

didn't kill my family members.

4

MS. MURRILL:

Well, Justice Kagan, I

5

think the record reflects that's not -- that

6

what Mr. McCoy wanted was to defeat the death

7

penalty by the means that he wanted it, which

8

was his alibi.

9

So I -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, let's take

10

Justice Kagan's hypothetical then on its own

11

terms.

12

What would be the outcome in that case?
MS. MURRILL:

I -- I think that

13

probably to some degree goes back to Justice

14

Roberts's hypothetical about a rational

15

conversation with a defendant who was willing

16

to have a conversation and not simply close the

17

door to the discussion, which -- which is much

18

more like the defendant in -- in Nixon.

19

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Let's posit all of

20

that, that we have a competent, rational,

21

thoughtful individual who makes a calculated

22

decision autonomously, that that's the route he

23

or she wishes to go.

24
25

Is it -- can we even call it
assistance of counsel?

Is that what it is when

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
56
1

a lawyer overrides that person's wishes?

2

MS. MURRILL:

I -- I do believe it

3

still falls within assistance of counsel.

deficiency prong and the norms of practice -­

the circumstances.

that.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Did -- did -- I'm

11

thinking back, I think the Chief asked you, or

12

maybe it was Justice Kennedy, he quoted the

13

language where he said "I've relieved you of

14

your burden," so he says, "I've relieved you of

15

your burden," he says to the jury, and he also

16

says, "and he's guilty."

17

That was earlier.

Now, in the context, was that -­

18

you're familiar with the record.

All right.

19

Was that, in fact, an admission that he

20

committed a crime; namely, first-degree murder

21

or second-degree murder or both, or are you

22

saying, no, it was not an admission because -­

23

if -- if it was not an admission, then why

24

didn't he tell the jury:

25

a mental state that makes it impossible for you

But, you see, he had

Heritage Reporting Corporation

to convict.

Or did he?

MS. MURRILL:

He did tell

them that -­

prevents you from convicting him for either

7

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Okay.
I'm sorry.

I

17

thought -- I'll go back to it, but I thought

18

the essence of his closing statement was he's

19

not deserving of the death penalty because, as

20

you heard him, he's a sick man.

21

MS. MURRILL:

It -- it -- the -- the

22

specific words that he used -- the totality of

23

his defense from start to finish was that he

24

did not have the mens rea necessary to support

25

the death penalty, the first-degree charge.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
58

2

And that was the gist of it.
There's some creep in his arguments

3

over time, I -- the words are there on the

page, but I would submit to you, again, that is

5

argument and that that is a deficiency question

6

under Strickland, that that is always -­

argument has always been a question of

8

deficiency under -- under Strickland.

9

not a new proposition.

That's

10

So I think that if we're -- he still,

11

and I would submit go -- we should go back and

12

look at what happened with the court and -- and

13

that -- that ultimately to my very able friends

14

to the left of me, this was not a court error.

15

This was a counsel decision.

16

And the court and the prosecutor went

17

over -- bent over backwards to try and protect

18

this record.

19

they could do to protect the record once trial

20

had started, once they were at the point where

21

they were choosing a jury.

22

There was very little more that

So -- so I think that it was a very,

23

very complicated situation and that when we get

24

to that point, then it needs to be a Strickland

You agree that the client has a

Certainly, Your Honor, I

think the client can take that position.

MS. MURRILL:

Justice Ginsburg, I

20

think that the Fifth Amendment could be

21

implicated in certain factual scenarios.

22

think in this particular case what we saw were

23

a -- a repeated, consistent sequence of waivers

24

of the Fifth Amendment so that everything he

25

said was already in the record; that he had

repeatedly put this information with his alibi

2

statements and his statements in the court

3

where the court continued to Miranda and read

4

him his rights over and over and over again.

5

And -- and so all of this information

6

was in the record, and now counsel has to cope

7

with it.

8
9

And that was part of the problem too.
So it -- it -- it is a -- a situation

where you certainly had a very difficult

10

client.

11

very near the -- two days before trial, and

12

that's where we are suggesting you draw the

13

line and treat it as an ineffective assistance

of counsel claim, but not that it doesn't

15

implicate other rights potentially, depending

16

on when it happens.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

21
22
23
24
25

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. WAXMAN:
never do this.

I know I'll never -­

I'll try to make five points:

First, Justice Gorsuch, this is
structural error.

The fact of the matter is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
61
1

that this was presented to the trial court not

2

once but twice on the record that what the

3

defendant was asking for is:

4

lawyer to admit that I am guilty, and the trial

5

court's ruling in this case made that

6

structural error and not ineffective -- not

7

properly viewed as ineffective assistance of

8

counsel.

9

Faretta, it was structural error.

10

I don't want my

Just as in Gonzalez-Lopez and in

Second, the notion that what Mr. McCoy

11

was asking for was not that his lawyer not

12

stand up and admit that he was guilty but that

13

he -- he insists on putting on an alibi defense

14

is simply refuted by the record.

15

At page 398 of the Joint Appendix,

16

this is during an argument in -- six months

17

before the trial, the argument was all about

18

whether his -- Mr. McCoy's subpoenas had to be

19

enforced or not and whether Mr. English should

20

be supporting him.

21

Mr. McCoy tells the court:

I am not

22

asking him to validate any theory.

This was -­

23

there was a dispute about whether Mr. English

24

was, in fact, investigating his alibi defense.

25

If there ever were a subsequent hearing about

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
62
1

that, that would be tested.

2

But this is flat out a case in which

3

the judge was told as soon as this issue arose,

4

twice on the record:

5

ethical duty to save my client's life; and the

6

client telling the judge:

7

lawyer admitting that I am guilty.

8

structural error.

9

I believe that I have an

I do not want my
That's

Number 2, Justice Breyer, this was

10

absolutely an admission of the charge -- guilt

11

on the charged crime.

12

closing, Mr. English got up and said:

13

telling you he is guilty of second-degree

14

murder and he should spend the rest of his life

15

in prison.

16

At opening and at
I am

And under -- under Louisiana law, the

17

jury -- the jury was required to be given the

18

choice, the following choices, which it was:

19

murder 1, murder 2, manslaughter, and not

20

guilty.

21

that murder 1, murder 2, and manslaughter all

22

have exactly the same mens rea defense as

23

murder 1.

24

crimes.

25

And there is no dispute in the record

That is not what distinguishes those

your third point.

MR. WAXMAN:

As to Cronic, we don't

think this is an ineffective assistance of

Cronic if it were because if the constitutional

8

right to defend means anything, it means the
