CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

4

argument next this morning in Case 142 on our

5

original docket, Florida against Georgia.

6

Mr. Garre.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

9

MR. GARRE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

10

Justice, and may it please the Court:

11

The Special Master based his

12

recommendation on two critical premises:

13

First, that Florida has suffered real harm as a

14

result of Georgia's ever-increasing consumption

15

of upstream waters; and, second, that Georgia's

16

consumption is unreasonable and largely

17

unrestrained.

18

found that Georgia's position practically,

19

politically, and legally is that it can consume

20

as much water as it wishes without regard to

21

any of the long-term consequences for the

22

Apalachicola region.

23

In fact, the Special Master

The Special Master nevertheless

24

concluded that this case should be terminated

25

at the outset and that Georgia's wasteful

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
4
1

consumption be allowed to continue unabated

2

because Florida had failed to show an adequate

3

-- adequate certainty of complete relief.

4

With respect to the Special Master, we

5

believe he -- he made a legal error on this

6

discrete issue, that the case should be

7

returned to him for him to complete the work

8

that he has begun.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Garre, I

10

thought that the Special Master -- this is at

11

page 63 to 65 of his report -- said that

12

Florida at the trial concentrated only on the

13

harm from the low flows in drought years and it

14

did not address the benefits of increased flow

15

during normal non-drought periods.

16

It didn't even address it, he said, no

17

-- no less showed the benefits that it would

18

gain.

19

established its case, it's Florida's fault

20

because all they did was concentrate on the

21

drought years.

22

So he said if -- if Florida has not

MR. GARRE:

Right.

And I think, first

23

of all, the Special Master's entire report has

24

to be viewed in light of the legal standard of

25

redressability that he applied.

And we believe

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
5
1

that he applied far too great of a standard.

2

Second of all, I think it is fair to

3

say that Florida's presentation was focused on

4

the harm that we suffered during drought

5

conditions in the extreme low-flow periods.

6

But two things about that are important to

7

understand.

8
9

There's two ways to redress that harm.
One is to provide more water during those

10

periods, the extreme low-flow periods, the

11

worst of the worst, and the other way is to

12

reduce the frequency and severity of those

13

drought operations.

14

And the United States, even the United

15

States in this case -- and it's at page 28 of

16

its brief -- recognizes that a decree in this

17

case limiting Georgia's consumption would

18

benefit Florida by reducing the frequency,

19

severity, and duration of drought conditions.

20

Now, we think that that benefit -­

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

22

Where does the record

show that?

23

MR. GARRE:

That we would benefit from

24

that?

Well, what I can point you to, for

25

example, is the 2012 drought.

And we've

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
6
1

explained this in the evidence cites at pages

2

48 to 49 of our brief.

3

And what that example shows is that if

4

more water had come into the system during the

5

2012 drought, which one of -- is one of the

6

worst that the region has experienced, it would

7

have meant that the Corps would not have dipped

8

into its drought operations during -- for -­

9

for nine months during that period, which means

10

that the Corps would not have fallen into the

11

red zone, where all the sort of needles are at

12

the far end of the spectrum, for nine months

13

during that drought.

14
15
16

And that has to have resulted in
beneficial effects for Florida.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

So here -- here's my

17

difficulty, Mr. Garre, with this argument.

18

it's especially with respect to this exception

19

2d, I think it is.

20

MR. GARRE:

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And

Yeah.
Is that you have

22

common sense on your side.

I mean, you say,

23

well, it has to have shortened the drought or,

24

you know, surely we would have gotten more

25

water and that would have been beneficial to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

us.

2

But there seems to be a real dearth of

3

record evidence specifically quantifying how

4

much more water you would have gotten, exactly

5

what benefits would have followed from that.

6

It just doesn't seem as though Florida put that

7

into the record, even though you kind of want

8

to say, well, that must obviously be true.

9

MR. GARRE:

Okay.

Well, first of all,

10

I agree with you it obviously has to be true.

11

Second of all, let me give you some more -­

12

but -­

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but, you know, I

14

guess what I'm saying is that's your first

15

reaction, but there must have been some reason

16

why it didn't put that into the record.

17

MR. GARRE:

18

some more evidentiary cites.

19

before I do that, let me just point you to what

20

this Court said in the Idaho II case, Idaho

21

versus Oregon II, which the Court said that

22

uncertainties about the future do not provide a

23

basis for fashioning the relief.

24
25

Right.

So let me give you
And then -­

And I think, overall, that's a central
principle that's critical in this case, is of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
8
1

course allowing more water flew -- through is

2

going to address this harm.

3

never had a situation where it's recognized a

4

state is being injured, it's recognized that

5

the upstream state is wasting a resource, and

6

it's recognized that -- and the evidence shows

7

that relief is possible and indeed likely and

8

the Court has said:

9

home.

10
11

This Court has

Nope, too bad, we're going

And so let me get back to the
evidence.

12

Let -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But in this -- but

13

in this case, Mr. Garre, the Special Master

14

said:

15

it was put in by Georgia, and Georgia's expert

16

said it wouldn't make enough of a difference -­

17

a difference to cure Florida's problem.

18

Yeah, there was proof on that point, but

MR. GARRE:

Well -- and I'm going to

19

get back to the -- the evidentiary cites, but

20

on that, Justice Ginsburg, and just to be

21

clear, we think that one of the Special

22

Master's central error was to deal with all of

23

this on the basis of a central -- of a

24

threshold redressability inquiry and that

25

instead what this should have done is gone to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
9
1

the equitable balancing stage of the equitable

2

apportionment proceeding, where the Special

3

Master would have to make all the findings that

4

he did not complete on the -- on the costs that

5

Georgia would incur of a decree, the full range

6

of harms that Florida has suffered.

7

conclude those findings.

8
9
10
11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

He didn't

You do agree -- you

do agree that you have the burden to show
redressability?
MR. GARRE:

We have the burden like

12

any plaintiff to show redressability in the

13

Article III sense, Justice Kennedy.

14

think that we meet redressability under any

15

conceivable standard.

And we

16

Now, I think when you get into the

17

equitable balancing stage, I actually think

18

that the burden shifts to Georgia at that stage

19

because if we've shown, as the Special Master

20

acknowledged that we have, that we have

21

suffered real harm as a result of Georgia's

22

inequitable conduct, then at that point under

23

this Court's precedents, Colorado versus New

24

Mexico in particular, the burden shifts to

25

Georgia, but I think -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You -- you would say

2

you do not have the burden, once you've shown

3

the injury, to show that a consumption cap can

4

help cure the problem.

5

MR. GARRE:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

MR. GARRE:

I -- I think we do.

Certainly, we have to show that a consumption

10

cap is going to work.

11

what standard?

12
13

And the question is by

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

Mr. Garre, but -­

14
15

You do not have the

burden to show that?

8
9

Well -­

MR. GARRE:

Do we have to show that a

mere certainty standard -­

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It is very

17

critical for me that you go through the

18

evidence of that.

19

MR. GARRE:

Yes.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now, just so -­

21

correct me if I'm wrong, the Special Master

22

made two findings.

23

drought periods, you didn't prove that the

24

Corps -- the -- the Corps would release more

25

water.

The first one was that in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
11
1

The SG agrees with that and says,

2

under the protocols in place, during drought

3

periods you're not going to get more water by a

4

consumption cap.

5

Putting aside whether that's close to

6

the gavel -- gravel situation or not, I'm

7

really not addressing that -­

8

MR. GARRE:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

Right.
-- but I do want

to go to the non-drought time.

11

MR. GARRE:

Right.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And as I read his

13

report, he -- he does say there was no evidence

14

of the cap providing you with more water.

15

in fact, I did find plenty of evidence of that.

16

So I'm not quite sure.

17

evidence and rejected it as meaningful.

18
19

And,

And he discussed some

So point me to evidence he didn't
discuss and explain why it's meaningful.

20

MR. GARRE:

Sure.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

MR. GARRE:

Alright.

I mean, first of all, just

23

to be clear, if Georgia's consumption is

24

limited, it's going to result in more water in

25

the system and that water is going to flow

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

through -­

2
3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
Kagan's logic point.

4

MR. GARRE:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

MR. GARRE:

7

And that's Justice

Well, no -­
But I'm -- I'm -­

-- the Special Master

recognizes that because -­

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

MR. GARRE:

Yes.

-- for example, on pages 6

10

and 30 -- 37 of his report, he recognizes that

11

the -- the Woodruff facilities, a

12

run-of-the-river facility, water's going to go

13

through it.

14

on page 33 of its brief.

15
16

The United States recognizes that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They -- they -­

they agree with you.

17

MR. GARRE:

That water is going to go

18

through.

And so, if we're talking about the

19

non-drought periods, what I would point you to,

20

for example, is the 2016 biological opinion by

21

the Fish and Wildlife Services, JX 168 at page

22

50, where it talks about the benefits of

23

additional water coming into the system.

24

I would point you to the Hoehn direct

25

testimony at paragraph 53 where it talks about

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1

the benefits of having additional water come

2

through to help reduce the salinity for the

3

mussels.

4

I would -- I would point you to the

5

Allan direct, paragraph 3-D, where it talks

6

about the benefits of even modest additions of

7

waters in helping to halt an irreversible

8

cycle.

9

I would point you to the White direct

10

testimony, paragraph 164, where it makes

11

similar claims about this.

12

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

MR. GARRE:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

These are all

I -- I -- I agree.

Okay.
But where do they

16

quantify it to show that the improvement would

17

be meaningful?

18

How -- how -­

MR. GARRE:

All of those talk about

19

how adding additional water, even in

20

non-drought periods, helping the system

21

rejuvenate is going to have a meaningful,

22

beneficial effect.

23

Do they have a precise -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so your

24

argument about the standard is that you didn't

25

have to prove the exact amount, you just had to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

prove that it was meaningful?

2

MR. GARRE:

Exactly.

And this Court

said exactly that in Colorado versus New Mexico

where the Court said that absolute precision is

not required.

6

proceeding governed by broad and flexible -­

Instead, this is an equitable

JUSTICE KAGAN:

8

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

9

Would -­
Mr. Garre, you talk

about a burden-shifting regime.

And I want to

10

-- I want to understand your -- your thought on

11

that a little bit more clearly.

12
13
14

So, once you show that there are
benefits, you think then what happens?
MR. GARRE:

Well, actually, I think,

15

and this is laid out in Colorado versus New

16

Mexico, Footnote 13, I think, is first, we have

17

the burden, by clear and convincing evidence,

18

to show that we have suffered real harm as a

19

result of Georgia's upstream consumption.

20

Once we meet that burden, the Special

21

Master I think concluded that we did, or he

22

assumed we did at the very least, then the

23

burden shifts to Georgia essentially to show

24

that the costs of the decree would be so much

25

that they outweigh the injury that Florida is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

suffering.

2

And part of that inquiry -­

3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, now, does the

4

burden ever shift back to you to prove your

5

case at the end of the day that the benefits

6

you seek outweigh the harms you'd cause or -­

7

MR. GARRE:

8

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

9
10

Well, I -- that's -­

burden ultimately rest with Georgia as a
defendant, in your view -­

11

MR. GARRE:

12

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

13
14

-- or does the

I think -­
-- and can that be

-- can that be right?
MR. GARRE:

First of all, I think

15

whichever way you think the burden lies at the

16

end, we meet it under the correct

17

redressability standard.

18

Second of all, I think what this Court

19

has talked about is when you get to that

20

equitable balancing stage, the burden is on the

21

diverting state to show that it's -- that it -­

22

it either cost too much or it's not worth it.

23

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I had thought -- I

24

had thought that the burden ultimately was for

25

the plaintiff who wishes to alter the status

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

quo to show that the benefits he wishes to

2

obtain significantly outweigh the harms that

3

the relief he seeks would cause.

4

MR. GARRE:

5

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

6

Well -­
Am I wrong about

that?

7

MR. GARRE:

Well, I think you are

8

under Colorado versus New Mexico, but -- but if

9

you are right about that, Your Honor, I would

10

say that we have met that and that the Special

11

Master's -­

standard.

Okay.

20
21

How -- how do you

Okay.
-- seeking this

Court's equitable -­
MR. GARRE:

First of all, assume no

22

change in the Corps operations.

The United

23

States itself recognizes, and this is at page

24

28 of its brief, that a decree limiting

25

Georgia's consumption is going to benefit

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1

Florida because it's going to reduce the

2

frequency, severity, and duration of the worst

3

possible periods, the drought conditions.

4

That's point number 1.

5

The second point is, is that the

6

United States has reckoned -- the Army Corps of

7

Engineers and the United States have recognized

8

that if this Court were to enter a decree in

9

this case, the Army Corps of Engineers would

10

review that decree and would adjust its

11

operations accordingly, so that it would -­

12

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, let's just

13

stick with the non-drought operations.

14

Assume my standard.

15

non-drought years for operations?

16

MR. GARRE:

Okay?

How do you win under the

I think we have to show

17

that it is a likelihood of at least partial

18

redress.

19

because -­

20

And I think that we have shown that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Let's assume that.

21

Let's go to the real question, which is if it's

22

your burden to prove the balance, assume that,

23

how have you shown that the benefit to you is

24

greater than the cost to them?

25

MR. GARRE:

Okay.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

2

MR. GARRE:

Thank you.

First of all, Justice

3

Sotomayor, to answer that question, you have to

4

know what the costs to them are.

5

dispute between the parties about that.

6

And there's a

They argue in their brief it's going

7

to cost them $350 million a year.

In fact, our

8

witness, Mr. Sunding, put on evidence it was

9

going to be $35 million a year, and the Special

10

Master didn't make findings on that because he

11

short circuited these proceedings -­

12

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So is that your real

13

beef then, that at the end of the day that the

14

Special Master went off track on

15

redressability, with non-drought years, you

16

have redressability, and that he should have,

17

therefore, conducted a more thorough balancing

18

test in weighing the equities on the

19

non-drought years at the very least?

20

MR. GARRE:

Yes, ultimately that's

21

what we think should happen next, and in that

22

proceeding what you would take into account is,

23

okay, what's the full extent of Florida's

24

injuries?

But, again, this goes

7

back to my first question.

Master thought, you know, I can't even begin to

9

do a cost/benefit analysis in the way that you

would have liked him to because Florida hasn't

shown that they're going to benefit at all.

that they're going to get enough water as a

result of these consumption caps going into

20

without that, I can't go forward.

21

MR. GARRE:

to that.

exactly how much more water would you get -­

12

seems to me that there's kind of a vacuum.

And that's the place where it

MR. GARRE:

Well, I don't think so.

14

And, you know, what I would point you to, for

15

example, is the United States' post-trial

16

brief.

17

If you look at page 19 of that brief,

18

I think, it recognizes that during low flow

19

periods, not the extreme low flows but the low

20

flows bumping up on the worst possible harm,

21

during that period, additional water coming in

22

would go through to Georgia.

23

And the example that it has is if you

24

had a flow rate at the border of 6,000 cfs and

25

additional water coming through of 2,000 cfs,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
21
1

that you then have 8,000 going through.

2

-- that's a lot of water.

3

That's

And our -- our witnesses

4

overwhelmingly show that that kind of water was

5

going to have a significant impact on the

6

Apalachicola River.

7

And I -- and I think, again, going

8

back to the -- stepping -- taking a step back

9

in terms of what we have to show in this

10

proceeding, this Court has always made clear in

11

this setting that uncertainties about the

12

future are not a basis to provide a brief, a

13

decree, that absolute precision is not

14

required.

15

the realm of equity.

And that's because this Court is in

16

This Court has never had a situation

17

where it's found harm, it's found inequitable

18

conduct, and it's found that relief is

19

possible.

20

record that relief is possible.

21

I think you have to conclude on this

And the Special Master, the error that

22

he committed, and I would agree with Justice

23

Gorsuch on this, is he got off track on this

24

threshold redressability ruling, that instead

25

he should have continued the good work that he

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
22
1

had done, made all the findings in terms of all

2

the harm that Florida suffers, the costs that

3

Georgia is going to incur -- incur from a

4

decree, and then determine whether or not a

5

decree, an equitable apportionment, should be

6

entered.

7

Now, if I could go to the-- the Army

8

Corps of Engineers because I do think that this

9

is a separate basis for finding redressability.

10

And to be fair to the Special Master, he didn't

11

have the benefit of this.

12

record of the decision that was issued about

13

six weeks after the Special Master made his

14

recommendation here, where the Army Corps of

15

Engineers said if this Court enters a decree in

16

this case, it would review that decree and

17

adjust its operations accordingly.

18
19

And that's the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
March 30 decree?

20

MR. GARRE:

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

MR. GARRE:

23

on page 18 of that document.

24
25

Is that the

Yes, Your Honor.
Okay.

And I think if -- that's

And the United States importantly
recognizes that, in its brief, at page 30 of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
23
1

its brief, that that -- that a decree in this

2

case would form a part of the constellation of

3

laws that the Army Corps of Engineers would

4

have to look to in order to decide how to

5

respond to that.

6

We don't know what the Army Corps of

7

Engineers is going to do, but I think common

8

sense would tell you that any good government

9

actor would look at a decision by this Court

10

and seek to adjust its operations in a way that

11

would facilitate that decree.

12

take the Army Corps of Engineers' word for it.

13

And you can just

At page 4 of that document, the record

14

of decision, the Army Corps of Engineers says

15

that it has continuingly -- continuingly

16

asserted its preparedness to implement an

17

agreed upon formula by the states.

18

certainly consistent with the Army Corps of

19

Engineers' statements over time.

20

And that's

And then it also goes on to say that

21

the same formula could be instituted by

22

Congress or by the Court.

23

of Engineers, again, it has continually

24

asserted its preparedness to implement a

25

decree.

Now, the Army Corps

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
24
1

And that makes sense because, as the

2

government has recognized in this case, a

3

decree equitably apportioning the waters is

4

only going to result in more water in the

5

system and make it easier for the Army Corps of

6

Engineers to accomplish its objectives.

7

So then the question is what would the

8

Army Corps of Engineers do with that water?

9

Would it somehow stash it away or just send it

10

to Georgia or would it look at the decision, a

11

decision by this Court in this case and seek to

12

facilitate that decision rather than frustrate

13

it?

14

I think everything would tell you,

15

including the words that I just quoted from the

16

Army Corps of Engineers' own decision, that it

17

would seek to facilitate the decision.

18

that in itself should provide redressability.

19

The only way that it wouldn't provide

20

redressability is if we have to show a

21

certainty of complete relief today.

22

And

This Court has never required that.

23

If you look at your redressability cases like

24

Bennett versus Spear and Utah versus Evans,

25

this Court has treated situations where even

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
25
1

though the government wouldn't be formally

2

bound by a decision by this Court, it's

3

recognized that where that decision would

4

change the laws under which the agency would

5

have to operate, as was true in Bennett versus

6

Spears, that that was sufficient to establish

7

redressability because that made redress

8

likely.

9

And I think -- I've pointed you,

10

Justice Kagan, to -- to evidence in the record.

11

I would encourage you to read Mr. Hornberger's

12

testimony and other testimonies about the

13

benefits of additional water.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But I think -­
You haven't

15

answered Justice Kagan's question, though.

We

16

-- I accept there's plenty of evidence on the

17

benefits of additional water.

18

MR. GARRE:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Right.
She seems to be

20

saying the link that you haven't proven is

21

that, by putting in the consumption limit, that

22

that water would actually reach Florida.

23

MR. GARRE:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

Oh, okay.

think is her question.

Well -­

That -- that I

That's mine too.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
26
1

MR. GARRE:

Okay.

I mean, first of

2

all, I don't think the Special Master disagreed

3

with the notion that the water is going to go

4

flew -- through.

5

that.

6

-­

7

I -- I think that he accepted

And I think if you look at pages 6 and

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Have you at all

8

quantified how much water you were going to get

9

as a result of these consumption caps?

10

MR. GARRE:

And -- and I think -­

11

again, I think we did.

12

the testimony, the Hornberger testimony in

13

particular, other testimony in that the amount

14

of water -- there certainly was a -- a dispute

15

between the parties.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

cites, mention them.

18

Hornberger -­

19

I think if you look at

MR. GARRE:

If you have those

You've mentioned

And I think, again, I

20

mean, all that the Special Master -- the lens

21

that he was looking at the record in was

22

whether we had shown that there was a guarantee

23

that the Corps would exercise its discretion in

24

a particular way, and he concluded that we

25

haven't shown to certainty that the water would

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
27
1

get through.

2

And -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do you have

3

another cite besides the one you've mentioned,

4

Hornberger?

5
6

MR. GARRE:

Well, in terms of the -­

the water that would go through?

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

MR. GARRE:

9
10

I mean, I also would point

you to the government's brief, that recognizes
on page 33 -­

11
12

Yes.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It doesn't

quantify it, though.

13

MR. GARRE:

It -- well, we're talking

14

about -- our case was focused on showing that a

15

consumption cap would result in anywhere from

16

2,000 to 1,000 additional cfs flowing through

17

and that -- the limits we put in place.

18

think the evidence is very specific, when you

19

get into it, about that water flowing through.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

MR. GARRE:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And I

I see.

And -­
So you're saying

23

that the drought information holds true at

24

minimum for the non-drought one?

25

amount -­

So a certain

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. GARRE:

Well, that holds flew -­

2

true for the water going through.

3

there are two questions.

4

becomes:

5

through?

6

And then

Then the question

When is that water going to go

And -- and on that, I think first you

7

have to take as a given that water going

8

through, even outside of those drought periods,

9

is going to reduce the frequency and severity

10

of the drought periods.

11

relief.

12

government recognizes that at page 28.

13

And that in itself is

It's meaningful relief.

And the

On the question of water going through

14

in drought operations, we put in evidence -­

15

substantial evidence about how the Corps has

16

released -- made discretionary releases of

17

water at the Woodruff Dam even in drought

18

operations, going back decades.

19

And it also gets to this question of

20

how would the Corps respond to a decree in this

21

case?

an unusual situation here where there's sort of

23

a chicken and the egg problem; you know that

you have a serious problem here.

Not only have its oysters been decimated but

really a way of life is threatened here -­

3
4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So really what the

issue is -- let me see if I understand it.

5

MR. GARRE:

Sure.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You claim that -­

7

I have to go back to the report and read it now

8

to find this -- that the Special Master

9

accepted that a consumption cap of 1- to 2,000

10

at minimum would flow through, drought and

11

non-drought years.

12

MR. GARRE:

Well, I think -- let me -­

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

MR. GARRE:

Or I -­

-- let me say it this way:

15

I think the Special Master did find that we

16

didn't prove to a certainty, a certainty, there

17

was no guarantee, that's what he said on page

18

69, that the Corps would allow additional water

19

through during drought periods.

20
21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That I know it's

what it said.

22

MR. GARRE:

Right.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't care about

24

what happens with the Corps.

I'm saying did he

25

find that the consumption cap would release a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
30
1

certain minimum amount of water that would get

2

to the Corps?

3

MR. GARRE:

He -- he didn't -- he

4

certainly didn't frame it this way -- that way,

5

Your Honor, in terms of you can't say that I

6

found that X amount is going on to go through.

7

I don't think he was quart -- he felt himself

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Is your view,

10

Mr. Garre -- talk about non-drought

11

operations -­

12

MR. GARRE:

Sure.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- all right?

Is your

14

view that if a consumption cap saves -- you

15

know, saves 2,000 cubic feet of water, that all

16

of that necessarily gets through to Florida?

17
18

MR. GARRE:

Yes.

I mean, that's the

way nature -­

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

20

MR. GARRE:

Just by physics?

By physics, exactly.

And

21

eventually it's going to get through.

22

United States says it right in page 33 of its

23

brief where it says it's timing.

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

The

I mean, that's true,

but the question -- the mystery to me -- and I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
31
1

have only one question, which I could ask all

2

three groups of lawyers, is why isn't the

3

United States in this case?

4

they have -- they give mystical answers.

5

mean, the -- I don't understand it.

I mean, they -­
I

6

As I -- maybe I don't -- look, as I

7

understand the whole thing, imagine that I'm

8

standing south of the Woodruff in that

9

Apalachicola Bay or the river, I'm standing

10

there in the south, okay?

11

2,000 cubic feet comes from the Flint River.

12

And now what the Corps will do with the other

13

river, which is the Chattahoochee, it'll make

14

certain it gets up to 4500, so they put in

15

2500.

16

And suppose about

Now, if one day instead of 2,000 in

17

this drought period comes down to Flint, 3,000

18

comes down the Flint, why in heaven's name

19

doesn't the Corps send a little less and a

20

little more?

21

thinking is, well, if 2,000 comes down, then

22

the Corps will reduce that part that it sends

23

down the Chattahoochee by 2,000.

24
25

In other words, what they're

That's a pretty tough position.
Wouldn't they be a little grateful?

Wouldn't

they think anything of the oysters?

2

they say let's at least give them a

3

teaspoonful?

4

water.

5

Wouldn't

We've saved 2,000 cubic feet of

So let's give them a little bit of it.
Now, the obvious people to answer that

6

question is the Corps.

And whereas the other

7

case wants to get rid of them, in your case,

8

you don't want them.

9

here -­

But I would like them

10

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

I -- I -­
-- so I could ask

them that.

14

a teaspoon, what?

15

years.

16

there's a lot of extra water stuffed up

17

there -- you don't even have to get down into

18

Zone 3 -- because so much is flowing down the

19

Flint.

20

You're not even going to give them
And that's in the drought

And in the non-drought years, we know

Well, that's -- that's pretty good,

21

isn't it, because if you have a lot more in

22

Zone 3 up there on the Chattahoochee, then you

23

have more water to send down once the drought

24

begins.

25

And won't you do it?

What reason is
Okay?

which I expect you to say you're way off base

3

because I'd love to agree with you but I don't,

4

or you might say, yeah, you're on base, that's

5

the point.

6

I wonder.

MR. GARRE:

Well, Justice Breyer, I

7

mean, I think -- I think one way to think about

8

the Corps' position in this case, which has

9

evolved a bit -­

10
11
12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Am I basically on

base?
MR. GARRE:

I think you're on base to

13

think that life would be a lot easier if the

14

Corps had intervened -­

15
16

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, but I haven't got

this right as the -- as -­

17

MR. GARRE:

But I think -­

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. GARRE:

What?

-- I think one question is

20

-- is the light -- what the Corps has said to

21

you in its brief and the ultimate -­

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, what the Corps

23

has said to me at the moment, I'm assuming, is

24

sort of vague.

25

question was a good question?

My question is whether my

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
34
1

MR. GARRE:

2

(Laughter.)

3

MR. GARRE:

Well -­

Yes.

Without -­

4

absolutely, Justice Breyer.

But -- but I think

5

what the Corps has said to you in its brief

6

today, and I think that this in itself compels

7

that you not accept the Special Master's

8

recommendation, is that, first, Florida would

9

be benefitted by a decree insofar as it would

10

reduce the frequency, severity, and duration of

11

drought operations.

12

That's on page 28.

Second, they stand by the Corps'

13

statement in its record of decision that they

14

will review a decree by this Court and adjust

15

its operations accordingly.

16

And, third, they recognize that that

17

decree would form a part of the constellation

18

of laws by which the Corps would have to

19

operate.

20

So there's every reason to believe

21

that a decision in this Court imposing the

22

decree that equity would demand would result in

23

meaningful relief for Florida and we were not

24

required to show anything more than that to

25

allow this action to proceed.

Thank you,

Mr. Primis.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG S. PRIMIS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT

9
10

MR. PRIMIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

Florida has premised this entire case

12

on the proposition that a cap on Georgia's

13

water consumption alone would result in a

14

material increase in water to Florida during

15

drought without any change to Army Corps

16

operations.

17

After two years of discovery and a

18

five-week trial, Florida failed to prove that

19

case.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but I

21

don't think they've premised it entirely on

22

that.

23

Corps may change how it allocates water.

24

That's what they say in the March decision.

25

"Should the Supreme Court issue a decree

They've premised it on the fact that the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
36
1

apportioning the waters of the ACF basin, the

2

Corps would take those developments into

3

account and adjust its operations accordingly."

4

So, I mean, the -- the decree granting

5

Florida greater claims to the water will at the

6

very least change the facts on the ground and,

7

according to the Corps itself, cause them to

8

adjust its operations accordingly.

9

MR. PRIMIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, we -­

10

we do need to distinguish between drought

11

periods and non-drought periods.

12

trial was over drought periods and what the

13

Corps would do.

14

The entire

The Corps just finished a 10-year

15

process of creating a Water Control Manual that

16

determined that during times of drought,

17

Florida is entitled to 5,000 cubic feet per

18

second.

19

Fish and Wildlife Service, which studied the

20

region and said that would be adequate to

21

protect endangered -- endangered species.

22

That was blessed by the United States

And so what the Corps said in the

23

record of decision and clarified in its brief

24

in this Court is that, of course, it would

25

review and consider a decree or an order of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
37
1

this Court, but it also said explicitly that it

2

is not bound by an order of this Court and that

3

it may -­

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

MR. PRIMIS:

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

-- may not do anything.
Right.

And it

7

reminds me of sort of the contract bidding

8

discrimination cases where you have someone was

9

discriminated against during the bid process.

10

We don't require that person to show,

11

well, if I hadn't been, I would have gotten the

12

contract.

13

discriminated against in the process, you get a

14

fair shot like everybody else.

15

We just say if you show you were

It seems to me it's asking an awful

16

lot for Florida to have to say:

17

the Corps is going to change things the way it

18

benefits us.

19

MR. PRIMIS:

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We know that

Well -­
Instead they

21

just want to say, well, look, they're going to

22

make a different decision if they've got more

23

water to allocate.

24

MR. PRIMIS:

Your -- Your Honor -­

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You'll be able

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
38
1

to argue that.

2

argue that.

3

And right now they can't even

MR. PRIMIS:

Well, Florida can

4

certainly argue that, but the Corps has issued

5

its Water Control Manual.

6

challenge that has been brought to that manual.

7

That case is proceeding in the district court

8

of District of Columbia.

There is an APA

9

Florida has not joined that suit.

10

suspect it's because the arguments that it

11

would have to make in that suit would confirm

12

that the Corps is, in fact, necessary to solve

13

the problem.

14

I

And so there has been a lengthy

15

administrative process where Florida has made

16

all the same arguments it makes in this Court

17

and it chose not to challenge the Water Control

18

Manual in district court.

incomprehensible chart, and -- and what I -­

hypothetical because there's no possibility of

Now, what's wrong with that?

19

MR. PRIMIS:

Justice Breyer, the Corps

20

is governed by a panoply of federal statutes,

21

congressional dictates and mandates, as to how

22

to control the water in this basin.

23

And it is not as simple as if extra

24

water comes in, then you just pass it through

25

to Florida because they have articulated one

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
41
1

concern.

There are multiple interests in the

2

basin, there are multiple stakeholders, and

3

multiple congressionally-defined purposes.

4

Having studied this basin for a

5

decade, the Corps has determined that in

6

periods of drought and under its drought

7

operations, when the reservoirs get to a

8

critically low level, the Corps will release

9

5,000 cubic feet per second.

10

And that's not just an accidental

11

number.

That number was chosen because that

12

number allows the Corps to protect the

13

endangered species downstream, as the Fish and

14

Wildlife Services said, but also to protect

15

water quality, water supply in Atlanta,

16

navigation, flood control, hydropower.

Justice Ginsburg.

In periods of drought, the

continue to pass 5,000 cfs and store the

10

remainder of the water saved by that cap in its

11

reservoirs upstream until the drought -­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, what do we do

13

with their non-drought statement in their brief

14

where they say the U.S. does not mean to

15

suggest that a consumption cap would provide no

16

benefit to the Corps' operation in the basin or

17

to Florida?

18

And they say:

"As explained to the

19

Special Master, increased basin inflows would

20

generally benefit the ACF system by delaying

21

the onset of drought operations, by allowing

22

the Corps to meet the 5,000 cfs minimum flow

23

during longer -- flow longer during extended

24

drought, and by quickening the resumption of

25

normal operations after drought."

And the Corps' operations

account for that, when -- and that's baked into

the chart that the Special Master included in

his -- his report.

But the important point is Florida,
it's not a mistake that Florida didn't present

this evidence.

would shorten drought operations or make it

And I do understand the Court's

Florida didn't present its modeling

15

because when Florida's expert, Dr. Hornberger,

You're not going to ignore the determination by

inequitable in arrogating to itself water that

Yes, but let me -- let

me explain the role of the Corps' operations

17

here because I think it's important.

18

not a -- an ordinary apportionment case where

19

there is no act of Congress that -- that has

20

been involved.

21

This is

Here, there is an act of Congress.

22

Now, Congress, pursuant to its Commerce Clause

23

and other authorities, can enact statutes or

24

approve compacts that regulate or apportion

25

water in a stream.

In Arizona versus

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
60
1

California, for example, the Court concluded

2

that the Boulder Canyon project had directly

3

allocated the water and so there was nothing

4

left for the Court, as a matter of equitable

5

apportionment, to do.

6

Here, Congress has enacted a statute

7

that doesn't directly apportion between the

8

states, but it -- it does heavily regulate this

9

river system.

If the protocols that are in the

10

Corps' manual had been enacted into law, I

11

think there's no question that this Court would

12

have to respect that, could not order the Corps

13

to change it, and would have to take them as a

14

given.

15

Here, what Congress did instead was to

16

delegate to the Corps of Engineers the

17

responsibility for balancing all those

18

different interests and to do so through an

19

extensive public process that takes into

20

account all the basin interests, the -- the

21

hydropower, which was one of the primary

22

purposes of -- of this integrated system of

23

dams to begin with; flood control; Endangered

24

Species Act; and also refill -- refilling water

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

For -- for the reason

10

that I -- that I said, that here you have an

11

act of Congress that delegates the power to the

12

Corps in the first instance.

under the arbitrary and capricious standard,

MR. KNEEDLER:

There would be

additional water.

It depends what you mean by

"material."

4

happen as a result of that water.

5

ecosystem be -- be improved?

6
7

And so that is the evidentiary
question.

8
9

Would the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So suppose that we

think that looking at the record that was

10

before the Special Master, there was quite a

11

lot of evidence that, with more water, the

12

ecosystem would be improved.

13

Do you think -- as I hear you, you're

14

saying:

15

However much water is saved in Georgia comes to

16

Florida.

17

And there would be more water.

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, not -- that -- that

18

is not necessarily true because the Corps

19

operates the five dams as an integrated whole

20

and it does so in part on basin inflow but in

21

part on how much water is stored in the

22

reservoirs at any particular time of year.

23

So there are certain situations,

24

looking at total basin inflow, for example, if

25

more water came in from the Flint River, that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
65
1

would free up water to be stored upstream for

2

release during -- during low-flow periods.

3

It's operated as an integrated whole.

4

not a one-for-one tradeoff.

5
6
7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

There is

Now, it maybe -­

And that's true even

in non-drought operations?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

Right above -­

8

right above drought operations, there is a

9

period -- there -- under different times of

10

year, from 5 to 10,000 feet, all of that flow

11

would go to Florida, but there are other times

12

when only 50 percent of the flow would go to

13

Florida; there are still other times when none

14

of the additional flow would go to Florida.

15

That -- that is under the protocol.

16

But if the Court concludes that a cap

17

within that, not -- not -- taking that

18

framework as a given, that additional -- that a

19

cap would produce additional water, the Corps

20

does not have a stake in that fight.

21

I did want to address one point about

22

the -- the prediction, the question of how

23

certain it is what the Court will do -- the

Corps will do.

statutory regime in which the Corps has to

decide what to do with the range of additional

6

water that may be available at any particular

7

time.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But I just -­

I'm sorry to interrupt, but it does seem fairly

10

important.

You say we can't order you to do

11

something, but you've told us that you will

12

take it into account.

13

that's arguably real redress to Florida, that

14

you're going to take into account a decision

15

saying that, equitably, they're entitled to

16

more water, that Georgia is improperly taking

17

its water.

And it seems to me that

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

and you say you'll take it into account.

21
22
23

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well -­
And -- and -­

Well, several things

about that.
To say that Florida is equitably

24

entitled to more water can't ignore the regime

25

that the Corps of Engineers has put in place

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
67
1

because equity follows the law in an original

2

case as any other.

3

So if the allocation that the Corps

4

has made, I think, has to be taken as a given

5

in the Court deciding what -- what is an

6

equitable apportionment.

7

And Florida -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, you have said

8

-- you have said you don't have any stake in

9

the argument about whether more water would

10

help Florida.

11

when we're talking about your expertise?

12

Can't we ask you that question

You say, well, whatever you decide,

13

we'll use our expertise to follow it, but then

14

you don't tell us what to decide and you're the

15

experts.

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, the -- the Corps

17

is the expert through the process of the -- of

18

the manual, which was exactly what Congress

19

meant.

20

going back to the -- the Chief -- Chief

21

Justice's question, if -- what would the Corps

22

do if this Court entered a decree, first of

23

all, if the Court entered a decree that Florida

24

needed more water than the Corps of Engineers'

25

operation protocols right now provide for,

The Corps -- if -- if this Court -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
68
1

that's really sort of inconsistent with the way

2

this case began, which is that -- that -- that

3

it was premised on the fact that the Corps'

4

procedures would not have to be changed.

5

And that's not to say that the -- that

6

I suppose the Court could decide to do that

7

anyway.

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

But we don't know -­

see, I'm sure you've got this point, but, I

10

mean, I don't know what to do without knowing

11

what the Corps is likely to do.

12

with you that it's Florida's fault; at the

13

beginning, they said we don't want the Corps in

14

here.

15

And I agree

And now it seems like you're their

16

best hope, all right?

17

why I seriously asked you the question, if you

18

were sitting right here in my shoes, what would

19

you do?

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

So -- so -- so that's

Well, what -- one

21

course would be, if -- if you agree that

22

Florida has not made the showing that it -­

23

that it said that it would make, that there

24

would be material benefits from the increased

25

flows, Florida has the ability to challenge the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
69
1

Corps of Engineers' master manual and say that

2

it does not provide sufficient downstream flows

3

for Florida or to petition the Corps to adopt a

4

new -- a new manual and revise it.

5

It's not at all clear that the

6

governing statutes -- may I finish? -- even

7

allow the Corps of Engineers to allocate

8

additional water for the Apalachicola Bay or

9

that to do so would be consistent with

10

balancing all the other responsibilities the

we do with the Special Master's conclusion on

that this case should end.

evidence, Shanahan direct at paragraph 60

my friend, Mr. Kneedler, neglected but the

there's no reason to -- to assume that the

the Compact statute passed in 1997 where

9

Congress directed federal officials to the

maximum extent possible to help facilitate the

state's agreed-upon allocation formula, there's
