ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT, ESQ,

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN NOS. 16-285 AND 16-300

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Respondents claim that arbitration

13

agreements providing for individual arbitration

14

that would otherwise be enforceable under the

15

FAA are nonetheless invalid by operation of

16

another federal statute.

17

This Court's cases provide a well-trod

18

path for resolving such claims.

Because of the

19

clarity with which the FAA speaks to enforcing

20

arbitration agreements as written, the FAA will

21

only yield in the face of a contrary

22

congressional command and the tie goes to

23

arbitration.

24

Section 7 of the NLRA, the result is clear that

25

the FAA should not yield.

Applying those principles to

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is that a concession

that this is a concerted action?
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I -- I don't know

that it is a concession that this -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean, if we

6

adopted that premise for the opinion of the

7

Court, wouldn't we have to say we assume that

8

this is concerted action under the NLRA Section

9

7, but the FAA prevails?

10

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think what you

11

would say, Justice Kennedy, is the concerted

12

activity that's protected by Section 7 at most

13

gets them to the threshold of the courthouse.

14

But Section 7 is directed to the workplace, not

15

the courthouse.

16

right in the workplace to decide they want to

17

initiate action, but then, once they get to the

18

courthouse -­

19

And what it protects is their

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the courthouse,

20

Mr. Clement -- Mr. Clement, the courthouse is

21

not at issue here as I understand it.

22

employees say we don't object to arbitration,

23

but what we do object to is the one-on-one, the

24

employee against the employer.

25

These

And the driving force of the NLRA was

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

6
1

the recognition that there was an imbalance,

2

that there was no true liberty of contract, so

3

that's why they said, in the NLRA, concerted

4

activity is to be protected against employ -­

5

employer interference

6

MR. CLEMENT:

That's right, Justice

7

Ginsburg, but it's collective action by the

8

employees in the workplace.

9

they get to their forum, be it the Board

10

And then, once

itself -­

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

does the NLRA say in the workplace?

13

for the mutual benefit, mutual benefit and

14

protection, mutual related protection.

MR. CLEMENT:

Where does -- where

It doesn't say

18
19
20

It says

I'm saying that's where it's

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, but why

-JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, why is it

21

directed there if it doesn't say that?

22

in fact, we said the opposite in Eastex.

23

said employees seeking to improve working

24

conditions through resort to administrative and

25

judicial forums, essentially the legislatures

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I mean,
We

Official

7
1

and the courthouses and the agencies, is

2

covered by the mutual aid or protection clause.

3

So, you know, in Eastex, we came up

4

against this question, said it was very clear

5

that the mutual aid and protection clause swept

6

further than the workplace itself, as long as

7

the ultimate goals were workplace-related,

8

whether you took those goals to the -- in the

9

-- you know, activity in the workplace or in

10

the agencies or in the courts, it didn't matter

11

at all, it was all covered by Section 7.

12

MR. CLEMENT:

That's right, Justice

13

Kagan, but the key words there are "resort to."

14

There's no right in Section 7 or anywhere else

15

in the NLRA to proceed as a class once you get

16

there.

17

And so -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that isn't the

18

issue, is it?

19

you can explain this.

20

this is an arbitration case.

21

it is.

22

-- would forbid joint action, which could be

23

just two people joining a case in judicial, as

24

well as arbitration forums.

25

I mean -- at least to me.

And

You started out saying
I don't know that

I thought these contracts would forbid

Regardless, I'm worried about what you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

8
1

are saying is overturning labor law that goes

2

back to, for FDR at least, the entire heart of

3

the New Deal.

4

two of them, Norris-LaGuardia, the NLRA, which

5

for years have been interpreted the way Justice

6

Kagan said.

7

What we have here is a statute,

They say that they protect the

8

joint -- joining together, those are the words,

9

joining together, those are the words of our

10

interpretation -- you could have two workers to

11

seek to improve working conditions through

12

resort to administrative and judicial forums.

13

Okay?

14

So Cardozo said we exclude cases from

15

-- we exclude cases, that's the savings clause,

16

where the contract is in contravention of a

17

statute.

18

two workers join together to go into a judicial

19

or administrative forum for the purpose of

20

improving working conditions, and the employers

21

here all said, we will employ you only if you

22

promise not to do that.

23

The statute protects the worker when

Okay?

That's the argument against you.

I

24

want to be sure that I didn't see, you know --

25

Concepcion, I've read it too, we all have, but

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

9
1

I haven't seen a way that you can, in fact, win

2

the case, which you certainly want to do,

3

without undermining and changing radically what

4

has gone back to the New Deal, that is, the

5

interpretation of Norris-LaGuardia and the

6

NLRA.

7

So I will stop.

I would like to

8

listen, and I want to hear what your answer to

9

that is.

10

MR. CLEMENT:

So the short answer,

11

Justice Breyer, and then I'd like to try to

12

get out a longer answer, but the short answer

13

is that, for 77 years, the Board did not find

14

anything incompatible about Section 7 and

15

bilateral arbitration agreements, and that

16

includes in 2010 when the NLRB general counsel

17

looked at this precise issue.

18

Now, the longer answer is, from the

19

very beginning, the most that has been

20

protected is the resort to the forum, and then,

21

when you get there, you're subject to the

22

rules of the forum.

23

So, for example, if an atypical worker

24

decides that he wants to bring a class action

25

on behalf of a handful of fellow employees,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

10
1

the -- he has the right to resort to the

2

courts, but when he gets there, if he's

3

confronted by an employer that says, wait a

4

second, you don't satisfy numerosity, you don't

5

satisfy typicality, then the employer doesn't

6

commit an unfair labor practice by raising that

7

argument.

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, of course not.

But are you now conceding that, in these

10

contracts in front of us, that they do not

11

forbid two workers or three or four from going

12

together, approaching a judicial forum, asking

13

the judge to hear their case, or an arbitration

14

forum, and of course, if it violates some rule

15

of civil procedure other than that, it will be

16

thrown out.

17

Are you conceding that that's the

18

issue?

And then I don't know which one it

19

violated, but nonetheless -­

20

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, the issue is just

21

as the employer can raise a numerosity defense

22

or a typicality defense, the employer can raise

23

a defense that you agreed to arbitrate this

24

claim.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Clement -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

11
1

MR. CLEMENT:

And that should be

2

enforceable -- and then, when you get to the

3

arbitration forum, just as you take Rule 23 as

4

a given, you should take the rules of the

5

arbitration forum as a given.

6

way it applies in every other context -­

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And this is the

Mr. Clement -- Mr.

8

Clement, do you recognize that this kind of

9

contract, this -- there is no true bargaining.

10

It's the employer says you want to work here,

11

you sign this.

12

It's what was called a "yellow dog"

13

contract.

14

essential features of the "yellow dog"

15

contract.

16

liberty to contract on the part of the

17

employee, and that's what Norris-LaGuardia

18

wanted to exclude.

19

This has all the same -- the

That is, that there is no true

MR. CLEMENT:

I have two responses to

20

that, Justice Ginsburg.

21

doesn't even take it that far.

22

arbitration agreements, as long as what's at

23

issue is an individual claim, are perfectly

24

fine and perfectly valid.

25

First, the Board
They agree that

So this isn't a principle that says

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

12
1

that the employee's position is so weak they

2

can't agree to arbitrate at all.

3

The second part of that is I suppose

4

that's one way of asking the question in this

5

case, is a bilateral arbitration agreement,

6

something that has been protected by the FAA

7

since 1925, is that really -- because all it

8

seeks to do is preserve what this Court on

9

three occasions has referred to as a

10

fundamental attribute of arbitration, is that

11

really a "yellow dog" contract?

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Clement -­
Isn't it -- isn't

14

it so that the -- the FAA, in its inception,

15

was meant to deal with bargains between

16

merchants, bargains between merchants who said

17

the arbitration forum is much less expensive,

18

so we want to go there, rather than the court,

19

but it was commercial contracts that -- that

20

triggered the FAA?

21

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Ginsburg, this

22

Court crossed that bridge in Circuit City.

23

what I find so remarkable is that in Circuit

24

City, nobody, not the AFL-CIO or anyone else,

25

was up in front of this Court saying, oh, by

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official

13
1

the way, you're sort of wasting your time here

2

because the NLRA in Section 7 is going to

3

strictly prohibit the ability to enter

4

bilateral arbitration -­

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that's not

6

true, Mr. Clement.

Your -- your adversaries

7

are taking the position, logically so, that, if

8

a union wants to enter arbitration, we've

9

already heard the Court speak on this issue,

10

the union can substitute arbitration for a

11

judicial forum because then the collective body

12

of workers has acted together and contracted

13

together on an equal footing with the employer

14

for that term.

15

Now, the problem that I have with this

16

bilateral issue is you seem to be thinking that

17

somehow the NLRB can't invalidate a contractual

18

term, just as state law concepts like fraud,

19

duress, the normal contract terms that

20

invalidate contracts, Section 7 and Section 8

21

of the NLRB basically declare a contract -- a

22

contract illegal if it does a certain thing.

23

And that is if it stops an individual

24

from concerted activities.

So what that starts

25

with is this contract's no longer valid.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

14
1

There's nothing to take to the courthouse -­

2

MR. CLEMENT:

So -­

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR -- if what it is

4

doing is stopping you from taking activity that

5

you are legally entitled to take.

6

MR. CLEMENT:

So a couple of things,

7

Justice Sotomayor.

First of all, I'd have to

8

double-check, but I'm pretty sure the employer

9

in Circuit City was not a union employee.

And

10

in all events, I think that the point is that

11

Circuit City said -­

12
13
14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, this issue

wasn't raised there.
MR. CLEMENT:

That's my point, which

15

is to say that if, in fact, employment

16

agreements were covered by the FAA, but if they

17

were bilateral, they would actually be unlawful

18

under the NLRA, boy, would that have been a

19

useful thing to tell the Court in Circuit City.

20

But no dog barked at that point.

In

21

the Gilmer case, where you were dealing with an

22

employment issue, ADEA, and a collective action

23

provision, the AFL-CIO filed its own amicus

24

brief to raise a different issue that hadn't

25

been briefed, the issue the Court eventually

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

15
1

decided in Circuit City.

2

oh, my goodness, what are we doing here,

3

Section 7 of the NLRA is directly on point.

4

But they didn't say,

And that's because the NLRA in no

5

other context extends beyond the workplace to

6

dictate the rules of the forum.

7

example is the Board itself.

8

Section 7 protects the rights of employees to

9

file an unfair labor practice before the Board.

And the best

Of course,

10

And, of course, they can collaborate

11

with their coworkers to file the unfair labor

12

practice.

13

before the Board, the Board doesn't have class

14

action procedures.

Now, that doesn't create

15

some huge problem.

That just reflects that, of

16

course, you get to resort to the courts, the

17

arbiter forum or the regulatory forum -­

But guess what?

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

MR. CLEMENT:

When they get

But before the -­

-- and when you get

20

there, you're subject to the rules of the

21

forum.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Let's take -- let's

23

take two cases.

One is a case where two

24

employees get together and seek -- seek

25

arbitration.

The other is when one employee

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

16
1

seeks arbitration but makes it a class action.

2
3

Is one case any easier than the other?
Or do we decide both on the same principle?

4

MR. CLEMENT:

I think, ultimately, you

5

decide both on the same principle.

6

way to think about that, though, is that

7

Section 7 requires two things.

8

concerted activity for mutual aid and

9

protection.

10

I think the

It requires

Now, if you have two individuals that

11

are trying to collaborate, that's concerted

12

activity and then it -- it has to be for mutual

13

activity.

14

talking off the shop and are helping one guy

15

get additional alimony, I mean, that's not for

16

mutual aid and protection.

17

concerted activity, but it's not the latter.

18
19
20

So, if a couple of workers are

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It might be

Suppose it's for

their wages.
MR. CLEMENT:

If it's for their wages,

21

I think if you have a couple of folks that are

22

doing it in the workplace, that's concerted

23

activity; they get to the forum and they get

24

whatever rights to proceed concertedly that are

25

available in the forum.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

17

If it's class action, it's arguably

2

harder because you can file a class action and

3

not collaborate with anybody.

know, essentially seek to represent a class -­

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

Well, Mr. Clement -­
You mean it's harder

for the employer to prevail or for -­

8
9

And just, you

MR. CLEMENT:
sorry.

For the employee.

I'm

It's harder for the employee to prove

10

that it's concerted activity.

But I don't

11

think as I answer your question -­

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But your -- your

13

case is really my first case, is it not?

14

is not really a class suit in its origins at

15

least.

16

MR. CLEMENT:

17
18

This

Well, there's three -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Or am I wrong -- or

am I wrong because there's Murphy Oil as well?

19

MR. CLEMENT:

Yeah, there's three

20

cases here.

And I think that, you know, two of

21

them might be more like the class action case

22

and one might be like the concerted activity

23

case.

24

the employers, but that's not why I'm telling

25

you that you don't have to make a distinction

I'm obviously representing all three of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

18
1

between the two.

2

It's really because I think the way to

3

think about the Section 7 right is it gets you

4

to the courthouse, it gets you to the Board, it

5

gets you to the arbitrator.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

--

MR. CLEMENT:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

10

But once you're there -­
Mr. Clement, what

about -­

12

Is this contract

MR. CLEMENT:

-- you're subject to the

rules.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What about Section 102

14

and 103 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act?

15

let's take Justice Kennedy's example.

16

three guys and they all join claims, so we

17

don't have the question about a class action

18

and whether that's concerted.

19

concerted.

20

so it's clearly for their mutual aid and

21

protection.

22

7.

23

Because
You have

This is clearly

And they're seeking higher wages,

So they're covered under Section

And then Section 102 of the NLGA

24

basically just repeats Section 7.

25

Section 103 says -- and I'm quoting now -­

"Any undertaking or promise in conflict with"

It is just an effort by the employer

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL, ESQ.,

PETITIONERS IN NOS. 16-285 AND 16-300, AND

MR. WALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

7

I'd just like to highlight one point

8

in what Mr. Clement said.

No one questions

9

that the FLSA permits the employees here to

10

forgo collective actions and arbitrate their

11

FLSA claims.

12

act in concert, the NLRA does not then extend

13

to concerted activities that they have validly

14

agreed to waive under other federal statutes

15

like the FLSA and the FAA.

16

through the 2010 general counsel memo and until

18

truly a situation where there is strength in

10

That's why this is

There is strength in numbers.

MR. WALL:

We have

So, Justice Ginsburg, with

11

all respect, there are provisions in the

12

arbitration agreements here, and they differ,

13

that allow for payments of costs and fees.

14

even if you thought that it just resulted in an

15

argument that the employees would be

16

practically unable to vindicate their claims,

17

those are exactly the kind of arguments this

18

Court rejected in Italian Colors, it rejected

19

in Concepcion, and said bilateral arbitration

20

agreements are enforceable under the plain

21

terms of Section 2 of the FAA.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But

Mr. Wall, we

23

didn't have in those cases a third -- or raised

24

a third statutory provision that protects a

25

particular action, in any type of action in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

23
1

mutual aid or concerted activity like the NLRB

2

or the Norris-LaGuardia Act.

3

But putting that aside, I'm not sure

4

that the FAA is now a rule of statutory

5

construction.

6

the FAA trumps the NLRB's concerted activity

7

statement and its broadness, that somehow it

8

stops, you say, at the courtroom door.

9

your colleague.

Basically, what you're saying is

So does

I don't know how you do that

10

when at least one of these agreements, if not

11

all three, have confidentiality agreements that

12

prohibit the employers from talking to other

13

employers, from combining with other employers.

14

If it does that and it stops them from

15

going to the courtroom door, is that an unfair

16

labor act?

17

MR. WALL:

So, Justice Sotomayor,

18

there's a lot there, and let me see if I can

19

unpack a handful of things.

20

times, this Court has faced a claim that some

21

other federal statute overrode the FAA.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

A half dozen

Only when it's

23

been a fight between whether that statute and

24

the cause of action it provided overrode the

25

FAA.

This is more as to the making of a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

24
1

contract, which is like a state law defense, a

2

common state law defense like fraud or duress,

3

except it's federal law here saying you can't

4

do this.

5

MR. WALL:

Justice Sotomayor, with all

6

respect, this Court's always said, look, is

7

there a clear congressional command in the

8

other statute.

9

agreements ought to be enforced; the NLRA

10
11

isn't.

The FAA is clear that these

And -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, it was clear

12

in saying that concerted activity cannot be

13

interfered with.

14

MR. WALL:

That's right, but for the

15

first 77 years, here's what everyone, including

16

the Board, understood that to mean.

17

protected from dismissal or retaliation when

18

you seek class treatment up to the courthouse

19

doors or the doors of the arbitral forum, but

20

once you're inside, you don't have an

21

entitlement to proceed as a class,

22

notwithstanding the FAA or Rule 23 or other

23

federal rules.

24

make that move, and that's a pretty radical

25

move, to say for the first time that the NLRA

2

you can't get there is that Section 7 doesn't

say anything about arbitration or class or

collective treatment, and unlike other

5

statutes, Congress didn't delegate to the Board

6

the ability to decide which predispute

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

And the reason

Why do we have to go

9

into all this class action business?

10

it seems to me that in each of these

11

agreements, the worker is forced to agree that

12

I will not proceed concertedly, that means

13

jointly, just one other person joining my

action with his and going into arbitration and

saying do both together.

said was an unfair labor practice, the employee

problem there.

That would be simple, clear; it

Okay?

MR. WALL:

What's wrong with that?

Justice Breyer, with all

7

respect, the historical premise is just wrong.

8

When you go back to 1935 and you come all the

9

way through the cases, they summarize them as

10

joint legal action or concerted legal activity,

11

but that's only true if what you mean is the

right to go to the forum and not be -­

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's what I'm

14

saying.

15

sorry, I wasn't clear perhaps, but nothing in

16

what I just said was that ordinary rules of the

17

courts like Rule 20 -- any other rule of the

court, Rule 23, you have to be clear, whatever

19

the rules are, they apply.

Of course, I haven't said -- I'm

And the only rule that wouldn't apply

would be a rule that would say we're

Well, that's the

point with this.

What is stopping the

concerted activity is not that -- which forum

22

they choose, whether it's court or arbitration.

23

Where you're stopping the concerted activity

24

is in the very act of saying this can only be

25

an individual arbitration, an individual court

2

What your adversaries have stipulated

3

to in resolving this question is, if they can

4

have collective activity in arbitration,

5

according to their argument, it's harder for

6

them to win.

7

illegal because it is removing collective

8

activity from both forums, from any forum

9

whatsoever.

10

But this particular provision is

MR. WALL:

Justice Sotomayor, again,

three quick points.

16

MR. WALL:

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

That's right.
-- where a

contract has been invalidated by statute.
MR. WALL:

So, second, even if you try

20

to go to the savings clause, which this Court

21

has never done in a case like this -­

22
23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

need to go there?

MR. WALL:

Because the NLRB on its

face doesn't say anything about this.

6

years ago, when they made that move -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, let's

assume -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

I'd like, Mr. Wall,

10

I'd like you to finish your answer, but I have

11

a question I'd like to get in before your time

12

expires, if I could just note that.

13

MR. WALL:

So -­

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

MR. WALL:

Go ahead.

So just to quickly finish

16

the answer, I think, again, the question

17

assumes the conclusion, which is it assumes

18

that, when the Board, five years ago, took the

19

concerted activities clause and stretched it

20

for the first time to cover your ability to go

21

pursue the rights, granted, collective

22

procedures granted to you by some other

23

statute, it assumes that those procedures that

24

it picked up, which in every other context,

25

like under the FLSA, are procedural, it somehow

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

30
1
2

converted to be substantive and non-waiveable.
And that's the move the Board can't

3

make because it can't interpret the NLRA's

4

ambiguity that way in the face of the FAA and

5

federal rules like Rule 23, so that's the move

6

that was off the table.

7

And if you understand Section 7 to

8

protect you from retaliation when you seek

9

class treatment but not to give you an

10

entitlement to proceed as a class in the forum,

11

then you're right, everything fits together

12

perfectly fine, and these arbitration

13

agreements are enforced.

because I don't think it adds anything.

9

I think it's not before the

identical, and both statutes, for basically

coexist comfortably with the FAA, and it's

really only D.R. Horton that put them in

tension by reading both Section 7 and the

15

equivalent sections of the Norris-LaGuardia Act

16

to grant the employees something that those

17

statutes had never been thought to grant them.

18

And it's resolving that ambiguity in

the face of the FAA that I think is a problem.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

2

an arbitration agreement that said that the

3

employer will pay the arbitration costs of men

4

but not women, that that would not be

enforceable.

6

Why not?

MR. WALL:

So I think a couple of

7

reasons, Justice Kagan.

The first is I think,

if that case came to the Court, I think we'd

9

have no trouble concluding that the ADEA

11

clear congressional command, and -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

So, if that's

13

the case and you're saying there can be a

14

conflict between statutes and the Title VII

15

would supply a clear congressional command,

16

even though Title VII says absolutely nothing

17

about arbitration.

MR. WALL:

Well, again, I don't think

it's a magic words test -- and we agree with

Petitioners on that.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

one understanding -- may I continue?

5

of Title VII says to the employer, you shall

6

not discriminate, and Section 7 says to the

7

employer, you shall not interfere with

8

concerted activity, such as three guys joining

10

MR. WALL:

Justice Kagan, it is not a

fundamental attribute of arbitration to

discriminate on the basis of race, age, or

times, to pick the parties with whom you

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. GRIFFIN, ESQ.,

2

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER,

3

ACTING AS RESPONDENT IN NO. 16-307

4
5
6

MR. GRIFFIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The Board's rule here is correct for

7

three reasons.

First, it relies on

8

long-standing precedent, barring enforcement of

9

contracts that interfere with the right of

10

employees to act together concertedly to

11

improve their lot as employees.

12

Second, finding individual arbitration

13

agreements unenforceable under the Federal

14

Arbitrations Act savings clause because they

15

are legal under the National Labor Relations

16

Act gives full effect to both statutes.

17

And, third, the employer's position

18

would require this Court, for the first time,

19

to enforce an arbitration agreement that

20

violates an express prohibition in another

21

coequal federal statute.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What do -­

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Griffin,

24

if -- if -- I'm not sure I fully understand

25

your position.

Individual -- individuals can

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

35
1

agree to arbitrate disputes so long as they

2

allow -- so long as the agreement allows

3

collective arbitration; is that correct?

4
5
6

MR. GRIFFIN:

No, Your Honor.

It's a

slight variation on that.
The Board's position is individuals

7

can agree to arbitrate individually, so long as

8

there is a collect -- a forum in which they can

9

proceed collectively.

10
11
12
13
14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the

arbitral -­
MR. GRIFFIN:
arbitration.

It doesn't have to be

It could be judicial.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

Right.

15

But if they agree to act -- the agreement

16

requires that they act individually, although,

17

to arbitrate, but there is a collective

18

arbitral forum, that that's all right?

19

other words, just they have to arbitrate,

20

whether they do it individually or

21

collectively, you cannot restrict that?

22

MR. GRIFFIN:

In

The -- the Board's

23

position is that, as this Court has said on

24

multiple occasions, that the arbitral forum is

25

the equivalent of the judicial forum for

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

36
1

effectively vindicating statutory rights.

2

So here, as has been mentioned, there

3

are four people who are seeking to get paid in

4

the Murphy Oil case for work that they did.

5

If -- if the forum is available to them to

6

proceed jointly -­

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

-- and the employer

agrees to have it done in arbitration, that's
fine from the Board's standpoint.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

So the

12

point is they -- they can, in their arbitration

13

agreement, waive the right to proceed

14

collectively in court, so long as they have the

15

right to do it in arbitration?

16

MR. GRIFFIN:

Because this Court has

17

said on multiple occasions that those two

18

forums are functionally equivalent for purposes

19

of effectively vindicating the rights at issue,

20

it's essentially like picking venue in -­

The question Justice

My

18

question is that many of the advantages of

19

concerted action can be obtained by going to

20

the same attorney.

21

considered individually, but you see if -- if

22

you prevail, it seems to me quite rational for

23

many employers to say forget it, we don't want

arbitration at all.

You would have a

6

judicial forum, if the employer doesn't want

7

arbitration.

8
9

In fact -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
that.

I fully understand

But the point is you're saying that the

10

employers are now constrained in the kind of

11

arbitration agreements they can have.

12

MR. GRIFFIN:

They're -- they're

13

constrained with respect to limiting employees'

14

ability to act concertedly in the same way

15

that, from the beginning of the National Labor

16

Relations Act, individual agreements could not

17

be used to require employees to proceed

18

individually in dealing with their employers on

19

terms and conditions.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the

21

position that the Board -- I think both

22

Mr. Clement and Mr. Wall emphasized that for 70

23

odd years, the Board was not taking the

24

position that it is now taking, that it was not

25

objecting to bilateral one-on-one arbitration.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

MR. GRIFFIN:

Well, with due respect

2

to my colleagues, that's an inaccurate summary

3

of the Board's precedent, Your Honor.

4

Board's precedent has always said that

5

individual agreements that require employees to

6

individually waive their right to proceed

7

collectively are violations of the National

8

Labor Relations Act.

9

held in 1940 in National Licorice.

10

The

That's what this Court

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What do you do with

11

the GC's -- the general counsel memorandum

12

that said you can waive the right to file a

13

collective lawsuit?

14

MR. GRIFFIN:

With all due respect to

15

the general counsel at the time, that

16

memorandum was never adopted by the Board as

17

the law of the Board and, in fact, was

18

explicitly rejected in the Horton decision and

19

subsequently in Murphy Oil.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I'm curious

21

about the -- the point that has been made that

22

the Board doesn't allow class proceedings.

23

There must be a reason -- you must have some

24

explanation for how that can be reconciled with

25

your -- your position, but I'd like to know

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

42
1
2

what it is.
MR. GRIFFIN:

Well, it's a misnomer to

3

say that the Board doesn't allow class

4

proceedings, Your Honor.

5

under the National Labor Relations Act works is

6

the Board doesn't have any independent

7

investigatory authority or ability to initiate

8

suits on its own.

9

The way a proceeding

What happens is charges are filed.

10

Those charges are filed by employers,

11

employees, individuals -- they could be filed

12

by a group of as many employees as you want.

13

The general counsel of the Board

14

acting through the regions decides whether or

15

not to pursue the complaint, and then the

16

general counsel proceeds in the public interest

17

to litigate the case administratively.

18

So it's not the type of proceeding

19

that -- that lends itself to the concept of

20

class actions, but it doesn't stop as many

21

employees as want to.

22

the union will be filing a charge that's a

23

representative charge in very much the same way

24

that a class representative would be pursuing a

25

class action in court.

And, in fact, frequently

Heritage Reporting Corporation

43

JUSTICE ALITO:

And the other question

2

I have is, how do you draw a distinction

3

between a -- an agreement precluding class

4

arbitration and all of the other Rules of Civil

5

Procedure that limit the ability of employees

6

to engage in collective litigation?

7

MR. GRIFFIN:

Well, here -- here, Your

8

Honor, we -- we actually have agreement with -­

9

with the other side.

The Board's rule does not

10

require any modification to the class

11

procedures in court.

says is you can't preclude people from

13

proceeding jointly by virtue of an unlawful

14

agreement imposed upon them by their employer.

2

So I'll give you an example.
In your -- in this Court's decision in

either walk out if they were faced with unsafe

14

conditions, or they could jointly file a

15

petition or a claim or a complaint with OSHA.

That was a subsequently enacted provision that

whether you can resort to -- can they stop you

19

from resorting to administrative and judicial

forums?

MR. GRIFFIN:

That's correct, Your

Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:

And in grievance

24

arbitration, by the way, how -- I just wonder,

25

because that's very common.

Are there

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

47
1

instances where -- there will probably be a

2

worker representative going to the employer,

3

but are there instances where the grievance is

4

a grievance that is shared by people, but not

5

perfectly shared, so Jones, Smith, and Brown

6

will go to the representative and say,

7

representative, please let's go before the

8

arbitrator, and you represent all three?

9

MR. GRIFFIN:

Certainly, Your Honor,

10

there are many instances where the union will

11

take a grievance with respect to overtime

12

that's not paid to multiple people on the same

13

shift.

14

This Court's decisions with respect to

15

the Steelworkers Trilogy all involve

16

arbitration situations that involve multiple

17

parties' representative.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Let's say the

19

arbitral forum says -- the rules of the

20

arbitral forum says you can proceed

21

individually, but you can -- and you can

22

proceed collectively, but only if the class

23

represents more than 50 people.

24

right under your theory?

25

MR. GRIFFIN:

Is that all

That's a rule of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

48
1

arbitral forum, and the employee takes the

2

rules of the forum as they find them.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you have a

4

right to act collectively, but only if there

5

are 51 or more of you?

6

MR. GRIFFIN:

What -- no, Your Honor.

7

What you have an opportunity to do is to try

8

and utilize the rules that are available in the

9

forum without the employer intervening through

10

a -- a prohibition that's violative of Section

11

7.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, the hypothetical

13

-- and the Chief can protect his own question

14

-- the hypothetical is the contract says you

15

have to have 50.

MR. GRIFFIN:
sorry.

Oh, I understood -- I'm

I misunderstood -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's my

19

understanding of the question.

20

MR. GRIFFIN:

21

the question.

I thought we were talking about

22

the arbitral forum itself has rules -­

25

arbitration agreement between the parties.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, the

2

arbitral forum has rules, just like the Federal

3

Rules of Civil Procedure.

4

saying is, well, once you get into federal

5

court, of course you've got to follow the rules

of the forum.

7

well, and I'm just saying -­

And what you're

MR. GRIFFIN:

And I'm saying that

9

those rules are equivalent, that you take -­

10

the employee takes the rules of the forum as

11

they find them.

12

What is prohibited here under the

13

National Labor Relations Act is an agreement by

14

the employer that's imposed that limits the

15

employee's right to take the rules as the -­

16
17
18
19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

Maybe

I'm not understanding.
MR. GRIFFIN:

So it would be okay if

the forum said that.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

MR. GRIFFIN:

Yes.

It's not okay if there's

22

an agreement between the employer and the

23

employee that limits their right to proceed.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -- so all

the employer -- well, and why can the arbitral

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

50
1

forum enforce the rule that says, basically,

2

you cannot act collectively if it's fewer than

3

50 people?

4

MR. GRIFFIN:

Because the prohibition

5

in the National Labor Relations Act in Section

6

8(a)(1) runs to employer interference restraint

7

or coercion with respect to the rules, with

8

respect to exercise of the rights under Section

9

7.

10
11
12
13
14

It doesn't say anything -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

So the

employer has to say -­
MR. GRIFFIN:

-- about the forum's

involvement.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but most

15

arbitration agreements tell you what the forum

16

is, whether it's the AAA or something else.

17

So, if the employer/employee agreement

18

says you shall arbitrate this under this

19

particular arbitration forum, and those rules

20

say we're -- we'll do collective arbitration,

21

but only if you have more than 51 people

22

because we think it's more efficient to have a

23

smaller number arbitrate individually, that

24

would be okay under your position?

25

MR. GRIFFIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE ALITO:

And what if the rules

of the arbitral forum say no class arbitration?
MR. GRIFFIN:

Your Honor, it would

4

be -- it would be just as though, in the

5

analogous circumstances, Congress said there

6

were to be no class actions in court.

7

The employee -- our position is that

8

the employee's right to proceed is -- is in the

9

forum under the rules of the forum.

anything is prohibited -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

If that's the -- if

12

that's the -- if that's the rule, you have not

achieved very much because, instead of having

14

an agreement that says no class, no class

15

action, no class arbitration, you have an

16

agreement requiring arbitration before the XYZ

17

arbitration association, which has rules that

18

don't allow class arbitration.

prohibitions against employer restraint -­

brief in this case, Your Honor, supporting the

position that the Board took in Murphy Oil, and

4

it addresses the circumstances under which, in

5

both labor arbitration and employment

6

arbitration, employees are able to proceed in

7

joint collective representative actions.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There's one anomaly

9

here, and I think you agreed that the Fair

10

Labor Standards Act, where the substantive

11

right comes from -­

12

MR. GRIFFIN:

That's correct.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- that under the

Fair Labor Standards Act, which provides for an

15

opt-in class proceeding, that right can be

16

waived.

17

MR. GRIFFIN:

Well, Your Honor,

18

we -- we don't agree with respect to employees

19

who have National Labor Relations Act rights,

20

who also have FLSA rights, that there can be a

21

waiver of the right to proceed jointly.

22

It's -- if -- if you imagine it in

23

mathematical terms, there's a set of people who

24

have rights under the Fair Labor Standards Act.

25

There's a lesser included subset of people who

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

53
1

have rights under both the Fair Labor Standards

2

Act and the National Labor Relations Act.

3

And as to that lesser-included set,

4

there's no ability to waive the right in an

5

agreement with an employer to proceed

6

collectively.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you have a view,

8

Mr. Griffin, as to whether bringing a class

9

action is itself concerted activity by a single

10

named plaintiff?

11

MR. GRIFFIN:

Yeah -- yes, Your Honor.

12

That -- that law is essentially unchallenged

13

here, and the Board's law is that, if an

14

individual takes action to initiate, to induce,

15

or to prepare for group action, that that is

16

concerted activity as understood under Section

17

7.

18

And -- and the Board specifically held

19

in Murphy Oil -- and we've briefed this in our

20

brief -- that -- that a class action fits

21

within the notion of initiating, inducing,

22

preparing for.

23

In fact, the Lewis case involved an

MR. ORTIZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

5

If I may respond to a few points of

6

Mr. Wall's, there seems to be a belief on the

7

employer's side that allowing employees to

8

waive Section 20 -- Rule 23, Rule 20, and

9

Section 16(b) rights under the Fair Labor

10

Standards side -- Fair Labor Standards Act,

11

except when the -- Section 7 of the NLRA is in

12

the picture, somehow creates an anomaly.

13

That is not the case, Your Honors.

14

All these other -- Rule 20, Rule 23, and

15

Section 16 create remedial mechanisms, but they

16

create no substantive rights.

Rule -- Section 7 of the NLRA, Section

18

2 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, on the other

20

21

this case in a very unsatisfactory way to

22

everybody, except perhaps it's simple, is you

23

just simply read the words what the employer

24

cannot stop is joint effort, like making a

joint claim, nothing to do with class actions,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

58

just making a joint claim, resorting to

2

administrative and judicial forums for the

purpose of making that joint claim?

clause that prevents the enforcement of illegal

MR. ORTIZ:

Sure, you can, Your Honor.

12

Section 7 clearly prohibits this kind of

behavior, and in Kaiser Steel, this Court

itself said that such contracts are illegal and

cannot be enforced by a court.

Why do you not -- I

MR. ORTIZ:

Yes, you did, Your Honor.

The language clearly controls.
JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

And the

22

statute was passed after the Arbitration Act,

wasn't it?

24

MR. ORTIZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

MR. ORTIZ:

The section -- Section 2

13

of the FAA was taken -- was not just inspired

14

by the New York Arbitration Act but was taken

15

word for word from the New York Arbitration

16

Act.

17

Court of Appeals basically said, in

18

interpreting that provision of the New York

19

Arbitration Act, near the time when it was

20

enacted by the New York State legislature, that

21

it would not cover at all illegal agreements.

22

And then Judge Cardozo of the New York

And Congress was aware of that history

23

of interpretation.

In fact, the Berkowitz case

24

was brought to its attention when it was

25

considering the Federal Arbitration Act.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Where -- where

2

are you on my 50-employee hypothetical?

3

agree with the NLRB that it is all right to

4

have a provision which says there is no class

5

arbitration unless there are more than 50

6

people involved?

7

MR. ORTIZ:

Do you

The employer, Your Honor,

8

cannot coerce employees into that forum, unless

9

there is an alternative forum available with,

10

say, the courts where -­

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

MR. ORTIZ:

13

Well, okay.

-- fewer than 50 employees

could proceed.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But is your

15

answer then that you disagree with the position

16

of the NLRB?

17

that, yes, once you're in the forum, you have

18

to abide by the rules of the forum.

19

the rules of the forum that I hypothesized is

20

one that's saying you've got to have at least

21

50 people before you can have a collective

22

action.

23

that means you are already out of the courts.

24

So the question is, is that a valid agreement

25

or not?

Because I understood them to say

MR. ORTIZ:

Yeah.

-- you are bound by cause.

5

But when an employer tries to coerce by making

it a condition of continued employment that

7

employees agree to a set of arbitral rules that

8

make collective action impossible and at the

same time takes away -­

is it doesn't make collective action

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERT:

The whole point

10

is no, you can't -- you can't engage in

11

collective action if there are fewer than 51

12

people.

13

MR. ORTIZ:

Then, in our view, Your

14

Honor, no, the -- the employer could not insist

15

on that.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

Let's

17

assume for the sake of argument that the

18

employer here has 49 employees and he gives a

19

contract to the employee that says you have to

20

arbitrate with me in this forum that doesn't

21

have class actions unless there are 50 more

22

employees.

23
24
25

That would be a different claim than
involved here, wouldn't it?
MR. ORTIZ:

Yes, Your Honor, it would

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

64

be.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It would be the

3

intent to interfere with collective action.

4

But let's assume it's an Ernst & Young that has

5

5,000 employees, I don't actually know the

6

number, but for sake of argument, 5,000

7

employees.

8

arbitral forum that limits class actions to 50

9

people?

What would be wrong by choosing an

10

The federal rules say that you have to

11

have a class that's big enough in numerosity to

12

warrant class treatment.

13

if there's only 20 or 25 employees, a judge

14

could, using its -- his or her discretion, say:

15

No, I'm not going to have a class action with

16

25 people.

17

MR. ORTIZ:

And, arguably -- and

No, no, but the

18

difference, Your Honor, is that under the

19

federal rules, you can still have a joint

20

action with two, three, four, five people, up

21

to 50.

22

And as I was assuming the hypothetical

23

from the Chief Justice, under the -- the rules

of the -- the arbitral forum he was putting

forward, it would be either 50 or more, or

Thank you, Your Honor.

JUSTICE ALITO:

On the right to -- if

20

the right to engage in concerted activity

21

includes the right to have -- to file a class

22

action in federal court, how can an agreement

23

provide that -- waive that right and require

24

arbitration, even if arbitrations -- even if

25

class arbitration is allowed, or can it not do

Heritage Reporting Corporation

66

that?

2

MR. ORTIZ:

Your Honor, under Section

3

7, as long as joint legal action is available

4

in one forum, that would be sufficient.

5
6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why?

Where do you get

that out of the language of the statute?

7

MR. ORTIZ:

May I proceed, Your Honor?

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

MR. ORTIZ:

Sure.

Your Honor, it's -- it

10

represents an accommodation, if you will, with

11

this Court's jurisprudence where this Court has

12

said in a series of cases that the arbitral

forum is equivalent to the judicial forum, so

as long as one can proceed in one or the other,

there should be no Section 7 violation.

Thank

MR. CLEMENT:
Justice.

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Just a few points in rebuttal.
First of all, I just want to emphasize

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

67
1

that, as Justice Kennedy said, you do have the

2

right to concerted activity in the sense that

3

three or more employees could decide that they

4

want to go to the arbitral forum and then they

5

would arbitrate individually, but they could

6

have the same lawyer and the like.

7

They also have other options.

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

What about the

confidentiality agreements which, I take it,

10

puts a damper on how -- how jointly these

11

people can proceed?

12

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, they can proceed

13

very jointly before they get there.

14

confidentiality agreement's not going to take

15

-- stop the same lawyer from thinking about the

16

three cases in conjunction -­

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The

But, Mr. Clement,

18

usually, usually when you have a right, the

19

fact that there is one way to exercise a right

20

left over does not make it okay if we've taken

21

away another 25 ways of exercising the right.

22

You know, when we think about the First

23

Amendment, we don't say we can ban leafleting

24

because you can always write an op ed.

25

same thing applies here.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And the

Official

68
1

The fact that there's something left

2

over by way of concerted activity does not make

3

it okay under Section 7 and Section 8 to

4

deprive employees of many other means of

5

protected activity.

6

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Your Honor, I'm

7

not sure you should blame me for that, because

8

as I understood the colloquy with Justice

9

Alito, that's exactly their position.

As long

10

as there's an avenue for concerted activity

11

open, that's good enough.

12

And I did want to mention there's

13

another avenue for concerted activity, which is

14

the three employers -- employees, rather, can

15

go to the Wage and Hour Division of the Labor

16

Department, and the Wage and Hour Division, if

17

it thinks there's a problem, can bring an

18

action that won't be subject to the arbitration

19

agreement under this Court's decision in Waffle

20

House.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Clement, how

22

-- and these are related questions, which is

23

how does an employee with these confidentiality

24

agreements or even with this agreement in

25

place -- how are they able to bring a pattern

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

69
1

or practice or disparate treatment cause of

2

action?

3

prefer an arbitration of 100 different claims,

4

let's say in a religious accommodation case,

5

where half the arbitrators say you must honor

6

this -- those 50 people's religious claims and

7

the other 50 arbitrators say no, you don't have

8

to.

9

And explain to me why employers would

Where -- how are employers and

10

employees helped with such a system and how

11

with these individual arbitration claims that

12

have become more recent in -- in modern

13

times -- this is not -- these bilateral

14

arbitration agreements have not been the norm;

15

they've been the norm in more recent times.

16

When the Court said that we weren't going to

17

recognize class actions in arbitrations, that's

18

when employers jumped to this.

19

deal with those two policy considerations?

20

MR. CLEMENT:

But how do you

Let me try to deal with

21

them, Justice Sotomayor.

But let me -- let me

22

first correct what I think is just a

23

disagreement between the two us, which is I

24

think, and this Court said as much in Italian

25

Colors and Concepcion, bilateral arbitration is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

70
1

actually the only kind of arbitration there was

2

until roughly Basil, and then you started

3

having the possibility of class arbitrations.

4

So the kind of arbitration that

5

Congress was trying to protect in 1925 was

6

bilateral arbitration.

7
8
9

Now -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, it was

bilateral commercial arbitration.
MR. CLEMENT:

Okay, but again, this

10

Court crossed that bridge in Circuit City.

11

Now, when you get to -- you raised a concern

12

about what if you can only bring a pattern and

13

practice case with, you know, more than one

14

plaintiff?

15

Well, you know, the parties really

16

haven't briefed that, but that did come up a

17

lot in Italian Colors because the Second

18

Circuit had a rule that said that you could

19

only bring a pattern and practice case pursuant

20

to a class action.

21

And try as I might to say that that

22

was a problem with effective vindication, I

23

only got four votes.

24

say that that wasn't a sufficient problem.

25

Thank you, Your Honor.
