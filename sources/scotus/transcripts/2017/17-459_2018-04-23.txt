ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. ZIMMER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. ZIMMER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

11

The stop-time rule at issue in this

12

case specifies exactly what the government must

13

do in order to end an immigrant's period of

14

continuous presence.

15

a notice to appear under Section 1229(a), and

16

as the name notice to appear suggests, the

17

government cannot serve a notice to appear

18

without telling an immigrant when and where to

19

appear.

20

The government must serve

Specifically, Section 1229(a) defines

21

a notice to appear as notice that provides

22

specific information, including the time and

23

place at which proceedings will be held.

24

Notice that lacks that required information and

25

does not tell an immigrant when and where to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
4
1

appear is not a notice to appear under Section

2

1229(a) and does not trigger the stop-time

3

rule.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Zimmer, you just

5

said defines the notice of appear.

Why do you

6

think that those 10 requirements of what have

7

to be in a notice to appear define a notice to

8

appear?

9

somebody says, well, look, Requirement 7 isn't

You could imagine a case where

10

in the notice.

11

flawed notice to appear, but it's still a

12

notice to appear.

13

notice to appear because there's a flaw in it.

14

That was a mistake.

So it's a

It doesn't become not a

MR. ZIMMER:

Well, right.

So the

15

answer to that, Justice Kagan, is -- is the way

16

that the statute is written.

17

Section 1229(a) doesn't just -- doesn't just

18

state what a notice to appear shall contain, it

19

does define what a notice to appear is because

20

of the language Congress used.

21

And because

And it's specifically the phrase in

22

this section referred to as a notice to appear.

23

And that is definitional language.

24

definitional -- sorry, definitional language

25

that Congress uses routinely throughout the

It is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
5
1

U.S. Code to give substantive meaning to

2

specific terms.

3

examples of this on page 4 of the reply brief,

4

including one particularly clear example where

5

Congress actually referred to this language as

6

definitional.

And we give a number of

7

And so, unlike a provision that just

8

states what -- if -- if -- unlike a provision

9

that just stated what a notice to appear shall

10

contain, this provision states that the

11

document in this section referred to as a

12

notice to appear is written notice that

13

specifies the required information.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And if any one on

15

the list, any one is left out, then it's not a

16

notice to appear?

17

MR. ZIMMER:

Well, yes, that's right,

18

Justice Ginsburg.

19

to recognize that most of the information on

20

that list will not vary from case to case.

21

It's -- it's standard information that's simply

22

on the notice to appear form.

23

But I think it's important

And so what we're really talking about

24

in this case are really only two types of

25

information.

It's the charges, the factual and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
6
1

legal charges against the immigrant, and the

2

time and place of the hearing.

3

And so those are really the two pieces

4

of information that are really required that -­

5

that there's any chance would ever be omitted,

6

and it's entirely reasonable that Congress

7

insisted that those two pieces of information

8

be included in a notice in order to stop the

9

time, because those are the two pieces of

10

information that show that the government is

11

serious, is -- is -- is committed to going

12

forward with an actual removal proceeding.

13

And, indeed, the -- the fact that

14

those two pieces of information are required is

15

supported by the only reason that's identified

16

in the legislative history for which Congress

17

actually enacted this rule.

18

there was no stop-time rule and immigrants

19

continued to accrue permanent residence -- or,

20

permanent presence all the way up until the

21

point that they were actually removed from the

22

country.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

Prior to 1996,

Do you think that your

24

interpretation is so clear that it wouldn't be

25

necessary for us to get beyond step one of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

Chevron?

2

MR. ZIMMER:

Yes, I -­

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

4

MR. ZIMMER:

Why is that so?

So it's -- it's so

5

because of the definitional language in Section

6

1229(a).

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

But I -- I don't see

8

definitional language in there.

9

where's the definitional language?

10

MR. ZIMMER:

Where -­

It's -- Justice Alito,

11

it's the "in this section referred to as"

12

language.

13

used throughout the U.S. Code in order to

14

define terms.

15

that the document "in this section referred to

16

as" a notice to appear is written notice that

17

specifies that information, that means that if

18

the government serves written notice that does

19

not specify that information, it has not served

20

a notice to appear.

21

And that is language that, again, is

When -- when Congress states

And, again, this is not a unique

22

provision.

That language appears throughout

23

the U.S. Code and is used to -- to do exactly

24

what it does in Section 1229(a), to define

25

terms to have a specific substantive meaning.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
8
1
2

And, again -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What do you do

3

with the government's position that using the

4

word "under" in the notice to appear

5

definitional section is different than what was

6

done in other provisions -- parts of this that

7

said "in accordance with" or "required under"?

8

MR. ZIMMER:

Right.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So there is a

10

difference of usage.

11

this -- "under" the same meaning?

12
13

MR. ZIMMER:

So why should we give it

Sure.

So two

responses -­

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

in and of itself create an ambiguity?

16

MR. ZIMMER:

Doesn't that in -­

So -- so two responses to

17

that, Justice Sotomayor.

The first is that the

18

government's argument -- even the government

19

admits that Congress was not consistent in how

20

it identified all the information required by

21

Section 12 -- by the notice to appear

22

definition because, as your question suggested,

23

Congress at one time uses "notice in accordance

24

with" and one time "required under."

25

there's no -- there's no real dispute that -­

So

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
9
1

that Congress was not consistent in this way.

2

But the other important difference is

3

that in those provisions -- those provisions

4

also referred to the notice required under

5

Section 1229(a)(2), and there's no defined term

6

in 1229(a)(2).

7

And that's really the key difference,

8

because the stop-time rule is only referring to

9

the notice to appear.

And notice to appear is

10

a defined term.

It's a term that's defined to

11

mean the notice of the specific information

12

listed in Section 1229(a)(1), and because it's

13

a defined term, there is no additional language

14

needed to convey -- to convey the -­

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If I -- if we were

16

to disagree with you that there -- and -- and

17

say there's ambiguity, where does that leave

18

your argument?

19
20
21
22
23

Do you lose?

MR. ZIMMER:

Well, no, Your Honor.

I

mean -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because of Chevron

and deference to the government?
MR. ZIMMER:

Right.

Well, no.

I

24

mean, as we explained in the brief, we also

25

believe that the -- you know, we also argue and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

-- and believe that BIA's interpretation is

2

unreasonable under Chevron's second step.

3

But -- but certainly as to the first

4

step, the fact that Section 1229(a) does use

5

the defined phrase -- the defined term notice

6

to appear and that the stop-time rule

7

specifically is triggered only on service of a

8

notice to appear under Section 1229(a),

9

invoking that document, that that does

10

unambiguously require that the government

11

actually serve the document that is identified

12

in Section 1229(a).

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How -- how does the

14

-- the logistical problem -- at least if I

15

understand it correctly.

16

notice to appear, but at the time, the

17

department doesn't know when the immigration

18

court is going to be able to slot this case in.

19

So there's this

So it doesn't have the -- it wants to

20

stop the clock on accumulating years in the

21

United States, so it sends this notice and then

22

-- and time to be determined.

23

how is the department supposed to determine the

24

time?

25

MR. ZIMMER:

How -- how -­

Well, so, as the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
11
1

government admits, and this is on page 50, Note

2

15 of its brief, the government actually had a

3

system, it was using a system that did allow it

4

to identify the time and include it on the

5

notice to appear.

6

And, in fact, this is explained in

7

even more detail in the amicus brief submitted

8

by former BIA chairman and Immigration Judge

9

Schmidt, who -- who explains that this system

10

allowed coordination between the Department of

11

Homeland Security and the immigration courts,

12

such that individual DHS officers could

13

identify a time that could be included on the

14

notice to appear.

15

And Judge Schmidt explains, again, in

16

great detail, why that system not only worked

17

but made the immigration courts function more

18

effectively.

19

on page 50 of its brief that it had this system

20

and simply states that it stopped using it.

21

There's no explanation as to why.

22

And the government, again, admits

So this is not an insurmountable

23

problem.

And it's not something -- and, in

24

fact, it's not even a problem at all because

25

the government had a system that actually did

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1

this.

2

And it's no surprise that the

3

government had a system that did this given

4

that police officers from -- in municipal

5

governments all across the country are able to

6

include hearing dates on -- on traffic tickets.

7

When they pull someone over, they can use, you

8

know, any kind -- the system -- any kind of

9

electronic system to identify the next

10

available hearing date and include it on the

11

ticket.

12

So this is not a problem.

13

problem at all.

14

has chosen to implement its system.

15

choice that -­

It's not a

This is just the way that DHS

16

17

know why they abandoned that system?

And that

MR. ZIMMER:

Well, no, the government

19

has never explained.

20

their brief.

21

never explained.

22

amicus brief -- and, again, this is from the

23

perspective of an immigration judge who is

24

actually using and benefiting from the system

25

-- he had no idea.

They do not explain in

It's, as far as we know, they've
And, again, Judge Schmidt's

And he -- as he explains in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1

his brief, the system actually worked.

2

the immigration courts work more effectively

3

because there are serious logistical problems

4

that are caused by not including this

5

information in the notice to appear.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

It made

Well, would it be

7

better to include a date, even if in the great

8

majority of cases the date is going to be

9

changed, which can be done?

10

MR. ZIMMER:

So, yes, the date

11

certainly can be changed, and yes -- and yes,

12

it is better to include a date in the initial

13

notice anyway.

14

why that's true.

15

And let me give three reasons

The first is that requiring the

16

government to include a date ensures that when

17

the time is stopped, when the immigrant is

18

prevented from accruing additional time, the

19

government is actually serious about proceeding

20

with -- with a -- with a removal proceeding, of

21

going forward with the proceeding.

22

And if you look at a case like

23

Camarillo, you can see why that's important,

24

where the government served one of these

25

notices that did not include the time and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

place, and then just sat on it for over two

2

years without doing anything at all.

3

And it's totally reasonable that in

4

that context Congress thought that that time

5

should continue to accrue on behalf of the

6

immigrant.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I don't see how

8

your rule would change that.

9

date and then, after a period of time, when

10

they are not ready to -- to proceed on that

11

date, the date is changed.

12

changing the date.

13

MR. ZIMMER:

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

15

MR. ZIMMER:

So they include a

And they just keep

Well, Your Honor -­
What is achieved?

So I think the system

16

does assume a certain degree of good faith on

17

the government's part to not put a date that it

18

knows -- knows to be false.

19

Congress certainly did not anticipate that the

20

government would simply lie.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

22

MR. ZIMMER:

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

So that -- I think

I thought your -­

But -­
-- I thought the

24

example you just gave us was an example of bad

25

faith.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

MR. ZIMMER:

Oh, I don't -- no.

I

2

think that what happened in Camarillo was not

3

bad faith.

4

time they were not ready to go forward at -­

5

with the proceeding.

6

They just served the notice at the

And, you know, there's nothing

7

inherently wrong with doing that, with serving

8

notice of charges and saying we're going to go

9

forward with a proceeding at some undefinite

10

time in the -- indefinite time in the future.

11

But the point is that the statute Congress

12

wrote makes clear that the -- that the result

13

of that decision is that the time does not stop

14

until the government is actually ready to go

15

forward with a hearing.

16

And that makes sense, especially

17

looking at the legislative history of why

18

Congress actually enacted this rule.

19

reason that was, was that Congress wanted to

20

make sure that immigrants were not able to -­

21

to avoid or delay proceedings in order to

22

manufacture additional time.

23

And the

So, prior to 1996, there was -­

24

Congress thought that there was a problem

25

because, because time continued to accrue until

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

the person was actually removed from the

2

country, that created an -- an incentives -­

3

incentive for immigrants to file motions and to

4

avoid proceedings, to draw out proceedings and

5

gain additional time.

6

So what the stop-time rule does is it

7

says at the time there's an actual hearing,

8

when the government is prepared to go forward

9

with the hearing and schedules a hearing that

10

could be avoided or delayed, then time stops.

11

But until that time, until an actual hearing

12

has been scheduled that could be avoided or

13

delayed, then the delay is rightfully with the

14

government.

15

always historically counted towards an

16

immigrant's accrual of additional residence.

17

And governmental delays have

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what if they

18

send a notice that specifies a date and then

19

let's say two weeks later they send another

20

notice that says that the -- the proceeding on

21

that date is canceled and a new date will be

22

set at some time in the future?

23

happen then?

24
25

MR. ZIMMER:

What would

I mean, I think in that

context -- I mean, that's an interesting

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1

question, Your Honor.

2

the -- the initial notice -- I mean, certainly,

3

as of the time that the initial notice was

4

sent, it would trigger the stop-time rule

5

because there was a date on the notice and that

6

satisfies the statute.

7

I think in that context

I mean, if the government then sort of

8

rescinded the date and didn't provide another

9

date -- I mean, I'm not actually sure that the

10

statute allows the government to do that

11

because the Section 1229(a)(2) allows for a

12

change in the hearing.

13

allows for a change in the hearing to no date

14

at all.

15
16

But I'm not sure it

And so I'm not sure the government
would actually have -­

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I think the

18

provision requires in writing a change of date,

19

doesn't it?

20

MR. ZIMMER:

It does.

And -- and I

21

don't think anything in that provision would

22

allow the government to change the date to no

23

date.

24

provides a date, the statute only authorizes it

25

to change that to a -- to a different date.

I think that once the government

show up because you're not told when to show

14

up, do you still have an obligation to tell

15

them where to mail the notice to?

16

MR. ZIMMER:

Yes, but -- yes, you -­

17

you absolutely do, but what happened here is -­

18

is Mr. Pereira did tell them where to mail the

19

notice to and they didn't send it to that

20

address.

And I don't think -­

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why are we here

22

at all, because -- since they didn't -- I -- I

23

-- I -- I'm just asking as a practical

24

question.

25

Wouldn't the -- the final order have

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

1

to be vacated because he was never given proper

2

notice of the change of address?

3

MR. ZIMMER:

vacated, Your Honor.

So that notice was

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I see.

And then later another -­
Okay.

It's just

the stop time that's -­

9

MR. ZIMMER:

Exactly.

So the issue is

10

when -- when the government actually began

11

removal proceedings in 2013, well after Mr.

12

Pereira had accrued the -- the 10 years of

13

continuous -­

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

MR. ZIMMER:

16

19

-- presence, then he

tried to apply for -­

17
18

Got it.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I had forgotten

MR. ZIMMER:

Yeah.

that.
Okay.

So -- but

20

to get back to the -- to the -- to the

21

question, to the logistical questions, the

22

point -- to get back to Mr. Chief Justice's

23

question, when the government is actively

24

trying to go forward with proceedings, and as,

25

you know, then the fact that there may be some

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
22
1

delay in actually scheduling those proceedings

2

doesn't count against -- doesn't count against

3

the government and doesn't change the stop-time

4

trigger, because the government is actually

5

going forward with proceedings.

6

But the issue is when the government

7

sends a notice that doesn't have a hearing at

8

all and says we will provide a hearing in the

9

future, that allows the government to -- it -­

10

it basically stops the process.

11

isn't going -- actually going forward with

12

removal proceedings.

13

The government

15

practical significance.

16

government can do one thing, which is saying,

17

okay, we know we have to -- we're -- you know,

18

we're interested in taking this action against

19

you.

20

have the, you know, available hearing officers

21

and all that, and we'll let you know.

22

It's just a question of the
It seems the

We don't quite know when we're going to

Or you simply say, all right, okay,

23

we're going to do it this day, and it turns

24

out, well, an officer is not available that

25

day.

We'll try in two more months.

Not -- not

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
23
1

a big -- you know, is there any practical

2

difference?

3

MR. ZIMMER:

Well, yes, there's a big

4

practical difference because, in a case like

5

Camarillo, they're not trying to do that.

6

I think that's the point.

7

And

When the government serves these -­

8

when the government serves an initial notice,

9

it doesn't actually necessarily represent the

10

government's intention to go forward with a

11

proceeding at that time.

12

pointing out that, in Camarillo, after the

13

government served this, it's not that it

14

couldn't find a hearing to be scheduled for two

15

years.

16

with the immigration court for two years.

17

just sat somewhere with the government doing

18

nothing about it.

19

And that's why I was

The government didn't file the notice
It

And there's no reason to think that -­

20

in fact, there's every reason to think that

21

Congress believed that in that situation that

22

time would not count for the government, that

23

that would continue -- that residence would

24

continue to accrue because the government

25

hadn't taken the trouble to even try to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
24
1

schedule a hearing.

2

But, of course, as soon as Congress

3

tries to schedule a hearing, and schedules a

4

hearing and provides notice of it, time stops,

5

even if the next available hearing isn't for a

6

year or two.

7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

I -­
I mean, that sounds

like some sort of -­

13

what would be achieved.

14

No, go ahead.
-- some sort of bad

But I still don't understand

So presume -- let's assume that

15

there's a reason, and we will ask Mr. Liu this,

16

why they -- why they've adopted this new

17

policy, but -- why they've adopted this policy,

18

but if, in fact, they have difficulty

19

ascertaining the date, and we were to adopt

20

your rule, then what -- they could say, well,

21

all right, on average, these would be held a

22

certain number of days after the notice goes

23

out, so we'll put that date down, but, you

24

know, two weeks before then or a week before

25

then or whatever, if we see that we're not

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
25
1

going to be able to do it on that date, then

2

we're going to, you know, extend it for 30

3

days, and they keep doing this.

4

What is the difference between that

5

and the situation here?

6

understand it.

7

MR. ZIMMER:

I just don't

Well, if I understand

8

your question correctly, Justice Alito, again,

9

I think that the -- that the difference is that

10

-- I mean, in that situation, the government

11

could, of course, solve the problem by just

12

simply providing the date.

13

understanding your -- your question, but that

14

if it -- as soon as the government -­

15

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Maybe I'm not

I think -- I think

16

the concern that, if I'm correct, that -- that

17

my colleagues are expressing is are -- would -­

18

we may be creating a perverse incentive here

19

for the government to issue earlier notices to

20

appear on dates that it actually has no

21

intention of proceeding in order to stop the

22

clock on clients like yours, rather than being

23

more forthright and saying we don't know when

24

we're going to be able to do it, but here's a

25

notice to stop the clock.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

We're going to wind up in the same
place perhaps, and it's just a paper exercise.

3

MR. ZIMMER:

4

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

5

Well, Your Honor -­
That's the concern,

I think.

6

MR. ZIMMER:

Right.

So -- but I -- so

7

I don't think that that's actually a concern.

8

And, in fact, I think the concern goes the

9

other way because, again, the government -­

10

there's no reason to think that the government

11

is going to lie on one of these -­

12

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

no.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But -- but your -­

far, counsel.

(Laughter.)

18

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

It -- it just is a

19

matter of administrative convenience that we're

going to list it for the first Tuesday on the

second month, and maybe we'll get there and

22

maybe we won't.

23

new notice, and a new notice, and a new notice,

24

and a new notice, until we get to the date.

25

And then we'll just send out a

So what's the difference between that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
27
1

regime and the regime we currently have?

2

why -- why is one better for your client than

3

the other?

4

And

Sometimes when courts require

5

additional procedures to aid a criminal

6

defendant or an immigrant, they wind up

7

perversely creating the opposite, unintended

8

effect.

9

Why isn't your case one of those?
MR. ZIMMER:

Well, it certainly

10

wouldn't create an adverse effect.

And, in

11

fact, I think because there's real prejudice to

12

immigrants from these -- these notices that

13

don't include the date and time because it

14

creates this -- this level of uncertainty, that

15

they don't know, is the government actually

16

going to go forward, are they going to file in

17

immigration court, are they ever going to seek

18

a hearing?

Will it be tomorrow?

19

two years?

Whereas, if there's a date, if

20

there are actual proceedings ongoing, then at

21

least you encourage the government to -- you

22

know, to -- to go forward with the -- with the

23

-- with the proceeding; whereas, if they don't

24

even have to provide a date, then you get cases

25

like Camarillo and like this case.

Will it be in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

1

Even in this case, the government did

2

not file the notice in immigration court for

3

over a year after it was initially served.

4

Even putting aside all of the problems they

5

later -- later had serving the hearing notice,

6

the government didn't try to get a hearing for

7

over a year.

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So the -­

Were there any

10

remedy for your -- for -- for your client in a

11

circumstance like the one I've described that

12

you can think of?

13

MR. ZIMMER:

Where they keep -- keep

14

scheduling the hearing?

15

the client could do is if -- if he or she

16

wanted the hearings to proceed, she could go

17

into immigration court and attempt to -- to

18

actually have a hearing held instead of having

19

that uncertainty.

20

the government is actively moving forward with

21

proceedings, then the stop-time rule has been

22

triggered, but, of course, that's the whole

23

point.

24
25

Well, what the -- what

Or no -- I mean, no, once

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could your client

go to immigration court before it's filed in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
29
1

immigration court?

2

MR. ZIMMER:

No.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Meaning -- so the

4

start of your client's ability to force the

5

government to give it a hearing doesn't start

6

until it's filed in the immigration court?

7

MR. ZIMMER:

That's correct, Your

8

Honor.

9

often these notices do not even say which

10

There's -- there's -- until -- in fact,

immigration court it will be filed at.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And, in fact, the

12

-- the B -- I call it the BIA; I don't know

13

what it's called today -­

14

MR. ZIMMER:

It is called the BIA.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- in Ordaz, said

16

that the notice to appear is not valid until

17

it's actually filed with the immigration court.

18

MR. ZIMMER:

That's correct.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so, if an

20

order to show cause is served today but not

21

filed, it's not valid; it doesn't stop the

22

clock, correct, under the BIA's own reading?

23
24
25

MR. ZIMMER:

If -- if it's never filed

-JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And a second

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
30
1

notice to appear?

2

MR. ZIMMER:

That's correct.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So, in

4

answer, I'm assuming, to Justice Gorsuch's

5

question is your client can make no choices

6

until the immigration court is notified?

7

MR. ZIMMER:

That's correct.

Yeah.

8

That's correct.

That -- and that's one of the

9

reasons that that's a key moment, the -- when

10

the -- when a hearing is actually scheduled,

11

that that's a key trigger.

12

And, again, this goes back to the -­

13

to the history as to why this rule was created

14

in the first place, which was in order to

15

prevent immigrants from extending their

16

proceedings in order to avoid -- sorry, to

17

extend their qualifying residence by avoiding

18

or delaying proceedings.

19

And until a hearing is actually

20

scheduled, until the government actually mails

21

notice of a proceeding, that concern simply

22

doesn't come into effect because there's

23

nothing an immigrant can do to avoid or delay a

24

proceeding that has not been scheduled.

25

And I also think it's important to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
31
1

recognize that the government's approach, the

2

government's interpretation, would allow the

3

government actually to -- to end -- end time,

4

to trigger the stop-time rule long before it

5

really has any intent at all of going forward,

6

because it could serve notices to appear on the

7

merest suspicion that someone might be

8

removable without even identifying charges and

9

without even identifying a hearing date.

10

And there's no reason to think that

11

that's what Congress intended, that Congress -­

12

that Congress would have intended the

13

Department of Homeland Security, on the

14

slightest suspicion that someone was removable,

15

to stop their time by handing out a form that

16

didn't even identify why the -- why the person

17

was removable.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Zimmer, can I take

19

you back to the language of the statute and

20

just ask about your assertion that this is

21

clearly definitional in nature?

22

question is, is that necessary to your

23

argument?

24

know, here's an alternative view of this

25

language, which is this language is a -- it's

I mean, one

And then the other question is, you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
32
1

-- it's -- it's a notice of shorthand, it's -­

2

you know, we need to call this thing something,

3

this -- this thing which tells you to appear in

4

-- at removal proceedings, and this is what

5

we're going to call it.

6

But it doesn't suggest that everything

7

that we say about this document is -- defines

8

what a notice to appeal is.

9

respond to that, and then tell me whether it's

So, you know,

10

crucial that I agree with your response to

11

that.

12

MR. ZIMMER:

So I guess I don't -- I

13

think maybe the word "definitional" -- I mean,

14

what the -- this document is called a notice to

15

appear, which in and of itself implies some

16

indication that it -- that it will tell someone

17

when, where, and why to appear.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

I mean, it's

19

obvious that the document is called a notice to

20

appear.

21

document is flawed in some way, that it becomes

22

not a notice to appear, as opposed to just a

23

notice to appear which is flawed in some way.

24
25

But the question is whether, if the

MR. ZIMMER:

Well, so I -- I think the

way the language -- the statute is written -- I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
33
1

mean, it's certainly -- our argument is not

2

that there cannot be a flaw.

3

there can be mistakes that can be corrected.

So, certainly,

4

But the way the statute is written -­

5

and I -- I'm not sure that there's really much

6

of a definition in terms of our argument -­

7

much of a difference in terms of our argument

8

between a definition and shorthand.

9

think what the phrase "notice to appear" means

But I

10

under Section 1229(a) is a document that

11

provides that notice.

12

It doesn't have to provide -- it can

13

have mistakes in it.

14

be -- it can't be corrected later, but it has

15

to give the information in that -- it has to

16

give the information listed in Section 1229(a)

17

in order to be a notice to appear that would

18

trigger the stop-time rule as a notice to

19

appear under Section 1229(a).

20
21
22

It's not that it has to

And if the statute could allow the
government -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, nobody had any

23

doubt that what was filed here or what was sent

24

here was a notice to appear, isn't that right?

25

MR. ZIMMER:

Well, it had the words

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
34
1

"notice to appear" written on top of the page.

2

It's a little bit odd, again, to say that it

3

was a notice to appear when it didn't tell

4

Mr. Pereira to appear at any particular time.

5

I mean, so I think the name -- it's

6

hard to see that it could be a notice to appear

7

when it didn't actually tell Mr. Pereira when

8

to appear and when to do anything.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose the -- the

10

parenthetical "(in this section referred to as

11

a "notice to appear")" were deleted.

12

that make a difference?

13

MR. ZIMMER:

Would

Yes, absolutely.

It

14

would be a very different statute.

15

mean, we may be making the same argument

16

outside of Chevron, but I think for purposes of

17

why the statute is unambiguous, I think that

18

parenthetical language is incredibly important.

19

And, I

And, again, the "in this section

20

referred to as" language is definitional

21

language that is used throughout the U.S. Code,

22

and it's language that Congress has actually

23

recognized as definitional.

24

on page 4 of our reply brief.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

And, again, that's

I mean, the rules of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

this Court and -- and the rules of appellate

2

procedure say a brief shall contain certain

3

things.

4

Do you think that's definitional?
MR. ZIMMER:

Well, no.

That's

5

definitely -- that's absolutely not

6

definitional.

7

different.

8

contain A, B, and C is very different than

9

saying the document in this section referred to

And -- and that's very

To say that a document shall

10

as a notice to appear shall contain -- or,

11

sorry, the -­

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, there's no

13

provision defining what a brief means because

14

everybody knows what a brief is, but suppose

15

that there were a section that says that a

16

document filed by the parties setting out the

17

parties' argument is -- shall be referred to as

18

a brief, so then anything -- any document

19

that's filed that omits anything that's

20

required by rule to be included would not be -­

21

would not be a brief any longer?

22

MR. ZIMMER:

I mean, if the rules were

23

written that way, yes.

But I -- but, of

24

course, the rules aren't written that way, and

25

they're not written that way for a reason.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official
36
1

I think that's why -- exactly why it's

2

important to recognize that this language,

3

which is not the way these rules are normally

4

written, that this language actually has real

5

meaning, that Congress chose this language for

6

a reason, and this is definitional language

7

Congress routinely uses.

8

If there are no further questions at

9

this time, I'd like to reserve the rest of my

10

time.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK LIU

16

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

17
18
19

MR. LIU:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The question in this case is whether

20

the stop-time rule may be triggered by a notice

21

to appear that doesn't contain a hearing date.

22

The answer is yes.

23

The statutory text reflects the

24

judgment that an alien shouldn't be able to

25

continue claiming credit for being in the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
37
1

United States once the government tells -- has

2

told the alien that it intends to remove him.

3

With or without a hearing date, a

4

notice to appear does just that.

5

alien that the government intends to remove

6

him.

And so the BIA reasonably concluded -­

7
8

It tells the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We don't know that

until it's filed with the immigration court.

9

MR. LIU:

10

I think that -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because you

11

already -- your agency has already said that in

12

Ordaz.

13

MR. LIU:

I don't think -­

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That a notice to

15

appear is invalid unless it's filed with the

16

immigration courts.

17

MR. LIU:

Well, I think that point

18

actually cuts against my friend, because if it

19

turns out at the end of the day that the

20

government isn't serious about pursuing those

21

charges, then it won't file the notice to

22

appear, and under Ordaz, that notice to appear

23

won't be given any stop-time effect.

24
25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

How is it that under

Ordaz a notice to appear isn't a notice to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

appear if it -- if it's not filed, as Justice

requirement that I -- I can't -- I don't see

MR. LIU:

7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Maybe

Well, the -­
But -- but yet a

8

document that contains some of the elements

9

that are required by this statute should

10

qualify?

11

backwards.

12

That seems to me to have it sort of
Help me out.

MR. LIU:

Well, the question in Ordaz,

13

Justice Gorsuch, was about what happens when

14

there are basically two notices to appear,

15

where there are changes to an existing notice

16

to appear.

17

one before the Court today.

18

That question is distinct from the

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I understand that.

19

But -- but the BIA, in its wisdom, has said

20

that a notice to appear isn't a notice to

21

appear if it lacks something that the statute

22

doesn't require, but it is a notice to appear

23

if it lacks something the statute does require.

24

MR. LIU:

Right.

25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And I am thoroughly

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
39
1

confused by that.

2

MR. LIU:

3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

4

Well -­
Maybe you can help

me out.

5

MR. LIU:

Well, let -- let me take the

6

second part first, which is why it is the case

7

that a notice to appear that lacks a date and

8

time is still a notice to appear.

9

And I -- I think the framework this

10

Court should approach that case with is the

11

framework it applied in Edelman versus

12

Lynchburg College.

13

there, it's set up exactly the same way.

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

At what point?

A notice to -­
A blank page with -­

with the title notice to appear, would that

5

suffice?

6

MR. LIU:

A blank page -- a blank page

7

would not be a notice to appear.

8

because a notice to appear is a charging

9

document.

10

And that's

It's like an indictment in a

criminal case, a complaint in a civil case.

11

What it needs to do is tell the alien

12

what proceedings he must appear for and why he

13

must appear for them.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Liu, help me.

15

I -- I -- I'm simple-minded.

16

seems to ask me when, where, and why.

17

are the three material elements of, to my

18

simplistic way of thinking, of the words notice

to appear.

That -- that -- those seem the two most

critical components of that word -- of those

words.

Notice to appear
Those

When am I appearing, and for what?

MR. LIU:

Well, I don't -- I don't

think Congress had that view.

A notice to

25

appear is shorthand for a notice to appear for

removal proceedings.

So what makes it a notice

2

to appear is that it tells the alien he must

appear for those removal proceedings -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. LIU:

But not when?

-- and why.

But not when.

6

And -- and we have very good evidence that

Congress thought the when and the where wasn't

part of the essential function.

Well, okay.

Everything else is good.

MR. LIU:

No, because those have to do

because (A) through (D) are about -­

Because that -- that's an

advisal about the mechanics of future

proceedings.

12

isn't that they're labeled (A) and (D) in the

essential function of a charging document,

What's special about (A) and (D)

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Doesn't Congress get

to decide what's the essential function of a

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

MR. LIU:

4

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

-- (A) through (D)

-- I think, actually -­
-- (E) through (G),

forget about those.

6

MR. LIU:

I think Congress actually

7

told us in 1996 and then again in NACARA in

8

1997, and these provisions are at the statutory

9

appendix at 69a.

10

In 1996, when Congress enacted this

11

very statute, it said that the stop-time rule

12

should apply to notices to appear issued before

13

the effective date.

14

The question arose, there were no

15

notices to appear because there were only

16

orders to show cause.

17

have been talking about?

18

So what could Congress

It went through the trouble the

19

following year to clarify that those notices to

20

appear that they were talking about were the

21

old orders to show cause.

22

to show cause didn't have to require a date and

23

time.

24
25

And the old orders

So that's proof right there in the
statutory history that Congress thought about

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

what's necessary to -- to be a notice to appear

2

and what's not, and it drew the line right

3

where the government is drawing it.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Liu, this

5

might be the same question and, if so, I -- I

6

apologize for beating you over the head with

7

it, but a -- a notice to appear, it's a special

8

kind of charging document.

9

that the government wants you to appear.

10

It's telling you

And then, if the government wants you

11

to appear, the first thing you need to know is,

12

where am I supposed to appear?

13

supposed to appear?

14

somebody who will do what they want to do with

15

me when I appear.

16

When am I

So that there will be

So it's -- I mean, it would -- it

17

would seem actually even more than the charges

18

itself that a notice to appear, you know, the

19

sine qua non is telling you where you should

20

appear.

21

MR. LIU:

Well, I think that's not the

22

-- the essential function of a charging

23

document.

24
25

It's not the essential -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, you talk about

it as a charging document.

And I hate to

interrupt you, but I'll just -- it's not any

3

appear, which means somebody has to know where

4

they're supposed to appear and when.

5

MR. LIU:

It's a notice to

And the government doesn't

6

dispute that the notice to -- to appear -- that

7

that type of notice needs to be provided to the

8

alien if the government is ever going to

9

effectuate a removal in these removal

10

proceedings.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

So why -- just in

12

case -- I mean, it's possible we will agree

13

with you.

14

starts -- stops ticking when the alien is

15

served a notice to appear under Section 12.

16

Then you look at the section, and it says a

17

notice to appear shall specify nine things,

18

including the time and place at which you're

19

supposed to appear.

20

I mean, it does say that the clock

And in the government's view -- I

21

looked at the notice to appear here -- every

22

one of those things is included on the

23

document, except not notice to appear -- I

24

mean, where you're supposed to appear.

25

that seems odd, but assume you're right.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official
47
1

We then get to step 2 of Chevron, and

2

step 2 says that the agency decision has to be

3

reasonable.

4

So I looked for the reason.

What's the reason that they don't want

5

to put in a notice to appear?

6

former chairman of the BIA said there used to

7

be a process called -- it was called

8

interactive scheduling.

9

MR. LIU:

10

And I notice the

Right.

JUSTICE BREYER:

It meant that a human

11

being who was over at DHS would go to his

12

computer, find out what dates were available,

13

and fill them in the notice to appear.

14

Now that wouldn't seem too tough.

15

18

that system.

19

why."

20

We

It would seem to be

And yet what he says, the former

And "he does not know exactly

Okay.

So I think to have a reasonable

21

agency decision you would have to say not just

22

that there are other things that don't appear,

23

that you say have to appear, but you'd have to

24

have a reason why this, which says does appear,

25

doesn't appear.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
48
1

So what is the reason?

2

MR. LIU:

The reason is that -- is

3

because of the -- the structure of the statute

4

and the regulations.

No, no, not because

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. LIU:

21

-- why did some group

Because

Why didn't it work?

The old -- the old system

had three problems.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MR. LIU:

Yeah.

Number one, it wasn't

24

allocating workload fairly among immigration

25

judges, which is crucial in -- in a system

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
49
1

where IJs are notoriously overburdened.

2

Number two, it wasn't capable of

3

prioritizing cases.

4

immigration system because you want to give

5

priority to aliens who are detained as opposed,

6

for example, to aliens who are not.

7

This is also key in an

And third, the old system was limited

8

access.

Really, the only people who had access

9

to it were what we called legacy INS officials,

10

people who had access to the account because

11

they happened to work for the INS before

12

Congress changed the structure.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

As to the third,

14

could you not invent a system today that would,

15

in fact, allow people to know what hearing

16

dates were available?

17

As to the second, I have no view.

18

don't know why.

19

first, where does it say that?

20

I

But as to the second and the

MR. LIU:

Well, I think, Justice

21

Breyer, to take your last part first, I think

22

it's -- you know, it's not theoretically

23

impossible to devise this system.

24

just that it would be a completely new system

25

that basically -­

My point is

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

The

question is you gave me three reasons.

3

MR. LIU:

Right.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

The third one I'm

5

rather dubious about.

The first two I'm

6

incapable of evaluating at the moment, so I

7

want to know where those reasons appear.

8

MR. LIU:

Well, they -­

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

In what document

10

shall I read the reasons that the BIA or

11

whatever these organizations were, why they did

12

change the old system, and I will find there

13

what you just said, so I will be able to think

14

about it, what document says that?

15

MR. LIU:

Well, there's no -- there's

16

no document I can point to you, other than the

17

BIA's decision in this case -­

18
19

those reasons there.

No, I didn't find

Are they there?

20

MR. LIU:

The BIA didn't specify -­

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. LIU:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

-- reasons why -­
Well, it used to be

24

-- there was a famous hot oil case, which you

25

know, and they discovered that the reasons or

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

the agency rule and so forth was in somebody's

2

desk at the Interior Department and had never

3

been published.

4

was the end of that case, by the way.

5

-- did -­

So are we to, in fact -- that

6

(Laughter.)

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

But did

Did -- did they, in

8

fact, publish this anywhere?

9

And so, if they don't really give a reason, and

10

I have a hard time understanding it, am I -- is

11

there a basis -­

12

MR. LIU:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

No is the answer.

Well -­
-- on which I'm

14

supposed to find it reasonable under

15

Chevron's statute?

16

MR. LIU:

Well, but I think the reason

17

given in the BIA's -- in the BIA's decision is

18

the reason I am giving, which is, was -- it was

19

infeasible for the DHS officers to be able to

20

access the immigration court's docket to put

21

the date in at this time.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What do we do with

23

the immigration judge who tells us it was

24

working fine; I don't know why they stopped it?

25

MR. LIU:

Well, the -- he doesn't know

Heritage Reporting Corporation

52

why he stopped it.

2

reason why -- why we stopped it is because the

3

reason didn't work.

4

I'm -- I'm telling you the

I -- I think what the -- I think what

step 2 of Chevron does, though, is say that the

statute doesn't rule out the system that the

I look at that, and Congress knew what
the BIA was doing or not doing.

MR. LIU:

defines this notice to appear and drops those

"as practical."

-- that's not -- that's legislative history but

not in terms of what members said but what they

9

did.

To me, that's a very telling

often fairly convincing.

-- inclusive of

your argument?

MR. LIU:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

And, to me, that's

Well -­
Against your

argument?

20

MR. LIU:

Well, two -- two points.

21

The change that Congress made does mean that

22

the notice to appear without the date is

23

complete.

24

which is the premise of the question presented,

25

which is:

But that just raises the question,

Is that document that omits that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
55
1

date still a notice to appear?

2

My second point is that if you -- that

3

that -- that's only half the story.

4

read the end of the story, Justice Sotomayor,

5

you'll see Congress reaching back and making

6

express in the text of the statute that those

7

old orders to show cause that didn't include

8

the hearing date do qualify as notices to

9

appear and should be given stop-time effect.

10

If you

So Congress, while, yes, it did give

11

-- move the notice of -- of the date

12

requirement into a different subsection, at the

13

very same time said:

14

documents to be given stop-time effect.

15

We still want the old

JUSTICE BREYER:

Do you want to -- do

16

you want to -- my questions were rather mean,

17

but they were designed to uncover something.

18

MR. LIU:

Right.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

And -- and it is

20

actually a very interesting question.

21

mean them to be so mean, I'm sorry, but -- but

22

the -- the fact is that there is an interesting

23

Chevron question that's difficult, and that is:

24

How much of a reason does an agency have to

25

give?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I didn't

something like not practical, which is denied

That's entitled to deference.

I mean, you look at -- look at
That was a Chevron

I would say the same thing here.

And

here we have something even more because we do

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
57

have the BIA saying expressly that it's -- it's

2

picking this reasonable interpretation over the

3

other precisely because this one is better from

4

an administrative perspective.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Suppose if you

6

-- if, you know, you say this doesn't allocate

7

workload, which is very important for the

8

overburdened judges, it -- it -- it doesn't

9

prioritize, all sorts of things, it's

10

impracticable, then I suppose if we rule

11

against you, you'll just say:

12

a date in, and if it turns out we can't make

13

that date, we'll move it back another six

14

months.

15

-- and -- in short, I'm not sure what that

16

would accomplish.

17

MR. LIU:

Okay, we'll put

If it turns out we can't do that, and

Well, I'm not sure what it

18

would accomplish either.

And we actually

19

believe telling the alien transparently that a

20

date is to be set is better than telling the

21

alien a date where we have maybe a 20 percent

22

confidence level that that's going to be the

23

actual date, but we know that, well, there's an

24

80 percent chance that it's -- it's going to be

25

moved.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
58

And that's because I think there

2

actually is more certainty to knowing, hey,

3

look, it's a date to be set, you -- we put a

4

bunch of advisals in the notice to appear to

5

keep your address relevant.

6

fact that it's a date to be set reinforces the

7

importance of that.

And I think the

It's telling the alien:
-- this isn't set in stone.

Look, nothing

We really do mean

it when we say keep in touch with us.

11

Putting the transparent date avoids

12

sort of misplaced reliance on the old date,

13

because these dates can not only move forward

but can also move back -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

Mr. Liu -­
One question about

18

MR. LIU:

-- as in paragraph 2.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- the proceeding

20

here.

21

removal in absentia, was the court aware that

22

Pereira hadn't received any notice of the

23

hearing place and date?

24
25

So, when the immigration judge ordered a

MR. LIU:

I believe the answer is no.

I -- I -- I admit the record, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
59
1

administrative record, we have is not

2

exceptionally clear on that point, but my

3

understanding is that in 2007, when that

4

initial removal order was issued, that the IJ

5

assumed that Pereira had received notice.

6

Now, when it turned out later that

7

Pereira hadn't received that notice, the IJ -­

8

actually turned out to be the same IJ, reopened

9

those proceedings.

And -- and so that's the

10

precise consequence that Congress attached to

11

the failure to give the date and time.

12

it play out in the very facts of this case.

13

You see

This is the (b)(5) consequence.

When

14

Congress said you need to get notice in

15

accordance with paragraph 1 or 2 of Section

16

1229(a), this was the consequence it had in

17

mind.

18

you have the authority to rescind it.

19

You can't get removed in absentia, and

Now my friend says the date is

20

important because it reflects the seriousness

21

with which we're -- we're proceeding with -­

22

with -- with the process.

23

raised and rejected in a very similar context

24

in Edelman.

25

whether the requirement that a charge with the

That argument was

There, the -- the question was

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
60
1

EEOC be -- be under oath or affirmation was

2

part of what a charge was.

3

And the Court said the point of that

4

verification requirement was to ensure that the

5

-- the complainant was serious enough and sure

6

enough to support the complaint.

7

there was an oath -- an oath requirement.

8
9

That's why

And the Court said that provision is
not part of the definition of a charge.

10

Neither provision incorporates the other so as

11

to give a definition by necessary implication.

12

And the Court said that to -- to recharge as

13

incorporating the under oath requirement as

14

part of its definition was "a structural and

15

logical leap."

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could we go back,

17

Mr. Liu, to the text of the statute, and could

18

you tell me what your best response is to

19

Mr. Zimmer's argument about this parenthetical

20

"(in this section -­

21

MR. LIU:

Right.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- referred to as a

23

"notice to appear")", which he says makes it

24

clear that everything that follows is part of

25

the definition of a notice to appear.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
61
1

MR. ZIMMER:

Right.

I -- I think that

2

parenthetical is just identifying the type of

3

document that is.

4

say the document that initiates the

5

proceedings, and that's the title of 1229,

6

Initiating Removal Proceedings, the document

7

that does so is referred to as the notice to

8

appear.

9
10

It's an easy shorthand to

I think it's just giving a -- an
identifying -­

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So then what do we

12

look to?

When you were giving your sense of it

13

has to include this, but it doesn't have to

14

include that -­

15

MR. LIU:

Right.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- if -- if -- if we

17

don't look to that parenthetical for the reason

18

that you said, what do we look to to decide

19

what is definitionally part of a notice to

20

appear?

21

MR. LIU:

Right.

Well, I think the

22

Court applies the same functional approach that

23

it's applied in Becker, in Scarborough with

24

respect to fee applications, in Gonzalez v.

25

Thaler with -- with respect to certificates of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
62
1

appealability, in Edelman with respect to

2

charges filed with the EEOC.

3

-- the Court does have to have some

4

understanding of what the function of that

5

document is.

6

The statute here makes plain what the

7

function of this document is.

8

initiate removal proceedings.

9

And I think the

It is to

I think it's also fair to look at the

10

function of the stop-time rule, and the

11

function of the stop-time rule is to basically

12

say to the alien:

13

being physically present in the United States

14

builds some sort of reasonable reliance

15

interests up to a point, it's no longer

16

reasonable to rely on being in the United

17

States once the government has given you a -- a

18

notice to appear that tells you that the

19

government intends to remove you.

Look, while it's true that

20

It was the point of the stop-time rule

21

to make the stop-time determination turn on the

22

beginning of the proceedings, not at things

23

that would happen later.

24
25

And if you're looking at legislative
history, Justice Sotomayor, this is 143

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1

Congressional Record S12266, where Congress,

2

again, amending the statute to make clear that

3

the old orders to show cause that lacked a date

4

would qualify, said the reason we're doing this

5

isn't because of some housekeeping measure but

6

for the substantive reason, the affirmative

7

reason, that we think the stop-time calculation

8

should be made at the very beginning of the

9

proceedings and shouldn't be affected by things

10

like how crowded the immigration courts are,

11

which could affect the timing of the hearing

12

and, in turn, the -- the timing of the hearing

13

notice.

14

I -- I think my -- my friend in the

15

reply brief puts a lot of weight on the word

16

"under" and -- and says that the word "under"

17

should be read to mean in accordance with.

18

You know, this Court has said "under"

19

is a chameleon and it must be understood in its

20

context.

21

that the context here rules out, it is the "in

22

accordance" definition because, as I have said,

23

(b)(5), Congress used those exact words.

24

know that, when it wanted to express something

25

different, it used a different word, as it did

And if there's one meaning of "under"

Heritage Reporting Corporation

So we

here.

If there are no further questions, we
ask that the judgment be affirmed.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you,

Mr. Zimmer, three minutes.

7

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. ZIMMER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. ZIMMER:

10

Thank you.

I think the main point here that I

11

want to make is just that the statute actually

12

doesn't distinguish at all between these

13

provisions in Section 1229(a), between the

14

types of notice that are listed.

15

government now wants to get up and say:

16

well, we think certain ones are important and

17

certain ones are unimportant.

18

And the
Oh,

And, you know, the most

19

straightforward response to that is that

20

Congress treated them all identically and so,

21

if any are required, which the government

22

admits that some are, they must all be

23

required.

24
25

And, indeed, the BIA even recognized
this.

The BIA did not pick and choose.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

The

Official
65
1

BIA -- the BIA recognized it was either/or:

2

Either they were all required or none were

3

required.

4

substantive requirements on a notice to appear

5

to trigger the stop-time rule.

6

And the BIA held that there were no

Now, to the extent we want to pick and

7

choose between these, it seems like the one

8

thing that should be included in a notice to

9

appear is when to appear.

And so it's hard to

10

see if the real inquiry here should be not what

11

the BIA did but which of these are the most

12

important, how the government can just pick,

13

for instance, the nature of the proceedings

14

against the alien, which is on the form, it's

15

just a line on the top of the form that just

16

says in removal proceedings under 240 of the

17

Act.

18

actually tell the immigrant when and where to

19

appear in a notice to appear.

But the government doesn't need to

20

And, again, it's hard to see why

21

that's what Congress would have intended,

22

especially given that, in 1996, the same

23

Congress that adopted the stop-time rule

24

amended the statute to specifically include the

25

time and place of proceedings in the notice to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
66
1

appear and, in fact, named that document a

2

notice to appear.

3

A notice to appear.

So the Congress that adopted this

4

stop-time rule knew that this was a document

5

that included this -- the time and place of

6

proceedings and, in fact, specifically it

7

required that that be provided upfront.

8

And, again, the government also notes

9

that the -- the Congress would have wanted the

10

stop-time rule to be triggered on the -- at the

11

beginning of proceedings.

12

the proceedings begin at a time where the

13

government has simply served a document on an

14

immigrant without a time of hearing that has

15

never even been filed in court.

16

But it's unclear why

You would never say that a civil

17

proceeding had begun when one party shared a

18

draft complaint with the other party.

19

proceeding is begun when it's filed in court.

20

The

And -- and so, in this case, the

21

government is arguing that the proceeding -­

22

that the stop-time rule should be triggered

23

long before the proceeding starts.

24

Camarillo's case, two years before the

25

proceeding was started.

In fact, in

In this case, over one

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
67
1

year before the proceeding was started.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But when he -- when

3

he had notice that the government was going to

4

attempt to remove him?

5

MR. ZIMMER:

Well, that the government

6

might attempt to remove him.

The government

7

does not always even file these notices in

8

immigration court.

9

data from DHS and the immigration courts,

If you look at data, public

10

approximately 10 percent of notices to appear

11

that are issued are never even filed in

12

immigration court at all.

13

So there's not even a guarantee that

14

when one of these documents is served, is

15

actually served on an immigrant, the government

16

could choose -- it could exercise prosecutorial

17

discretion and never file it in immigration

18

court.

19

That's certainly something that DHS

20

could do and it's something that DHS does.

21

that's why Congress triggered the rule on an

22

actual proceeding, when government -- when the

23

government was ready to go forward with an

24

actual proceeding, when there were charges

25

identified and when there was a time and place

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official
68
1

of the proceeding identified, not at the time

2

the -- that the government expressed some

3

abstract intention of possibly seeking removal

4

in the future.

Thank you very much.
