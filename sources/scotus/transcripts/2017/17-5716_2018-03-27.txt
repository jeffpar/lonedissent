Mr. Fisher.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. FISHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In contrast to the case you just

12

heard, the "based upon" question in this case

13

turns on the -- how the substantial assistance

14

provision, codified at 18 U.S.C. Section

15

3553(e), works.

16

whether the government is correct when it says

17

that a judge imposing a sentence in this

18

situation shall disregard or entirely set aside

19

the guideline range calculated according to the

20

defendant's criminal history and offense level.

21

And, specifically, the key is

And the answer to this question lies

22

directly in the plain text of the statute.

23

that text says the opposite of what the

24

government claims.

25

3a, which is in the government's brief, the

And

And I'm turning now to page

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
4
1

appendix, and that's where the statute appears.

2

And I just want to read to you the

3

operative language of Section 3553(e).

It

4

says:

5

accordance with the guidelines and policy

6

statements issued by the Sentencing Commission

7

pursuant to section 994."

"Such sentence shall be imposed in

8

So, in other words, that text directs

9

the court straight to the guidelines, not away

10

from the guidelines.

And it says nothing about

11

tethering a sentence to the mandatory minimum

12

or somehow setting the guidelines aside.

13

And it makes perfect -­

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The problem really

15

is that the guidelines are a little confusing.

16

They talk about an initial guidelines range,

17

and then they tell the court that the real

18

guideline range is a statutory minimum.

19

that it's talking about the guidelines doesn't

20

resolve that question because which guideline

21

are they talking about?

22

So

In my mind, they're told they have to

23

start from the statutory minimum in their

24

departure.

25

fact?

So how do we get away from that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
5
1

MR. FISHER:

Well, Justice Sotomayor,

2

we don't think that's actually the way the

3

guidelines are properly read.

4

referring to Section 5G1.1.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

MR. FISHER:

I think you're

Yes.

And in that section, what

7

it says is that if there's a statutorily

8

required minimum sentence, then the judge shall

9

adjust the guideline range to that minimum.

10

But remember the whole point of a

11

Section 3553(e) motion is to say that the

12

minimum does not apply.

13

Dorsey, what the court does when it grants a

14

substantial assistant motion is it lets the

15

defendant escape the binding effect of the

16

mandatory minimum.

17

read to you in the second sentence of Section

18

3553(e), directed right back to the guidelines

19

and the guideline range.

20
21

As the Court put it in

So now the judge, as I just

And it's -- and one other thing I want
to point out while I'm talking about -­

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So that means the

23

departure is not -- you're suggesting that the

24

departure -- this is the -- the effect of your

25

rule -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
6
1

MR. FISHER:

Right.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- the departure

3

starts with the lower guideline range, and then

4

the only way they can go is down from that?

5

MR. FISHER:

Yes, Justice Sotomayor.

6

But let me put this answer in context.

So,

7

first of all, remember, sometimes the guideline

8

range is going to be above the minimum, and

9

sometimes it's going to be below, and sometimes

10

it's going to straddle the minimum.

11

Section 3553(e) does is says when the judge

12

grants a substantial assistance motion, the

13

judge should then sentence that defendant like

14

anyone else, which is go to the guideline

15

range.

16

So what

Now, yes, that departure under 5K1 is

17

going to be from the guideline range,

18

regardless of whether it's above or below the

19

minimum.

20

just sentence that defendant according to the

21

guideline range, just as he would any other

22

defendant.

But, yes, the court is directed to

23

And that makes perfect sense, because,

24

again, what Congress has done, remember, is set

25

up a default regime of guided discretion under

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

the guidelines as set by guideline ranges

2

according to offense level and criminal history

3

categories.

4

created a disruption in a limited context of

5

mandatory minimums in particular drug cases,

6

but then Congress says, if there's substantial

7

assistance given, those two things cancel each

8

other out and we just want you to go back to

9

the default range.

And then it has stepped in and

10

And if I could add one other thing to

11

your question, Justice Sotomayor, that I think

12

puts this all together, it's to refer to the

13

Court's opinion in Melendez.

14

Melendez, the Court talks about two different

15

types of substantial assistance departures.

16

One is from the guideline range under 5K.

17

other, if the government wants to allow it, is

18

to allow that departure to go beneath the

19

mandatory minimum if the government puts that

20

as part of the motion.

Remember, in

The

21

So, when you go to 5K in the

22

guidelines, which is where these departures get

23

calculated, the beginning of 5K says that a

24

court may depart from the guideline range if

25

the substantial assistance warrants that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
8
1

departure.

2

The guideline at 5K says nothing -­

3

says nothing at all about departing from the

4

mandatory minimum.

5

the guidelines.

6

guideline range.

7

There's no such thing in

Only departures occur from the

And I think what cements this, if I

8

could return the -- the Court to the text that

9

I was referring to at page 3a of the

10

government's brief, it's the sentence -- it's

11

the reference to Section 994 as a whole.

12

The way the government reads this

13

sentence is that the government says, well, all

14

that sentence does is direct the court to the

15

5K guidelines, which are the ones for measuring

16

the substantial assistance departure.

17

But if that were so, what that text

18

would say is Section 994(n), because subsection

19

994(n) is the place in the Commission's

20

authority where Congress directs it to deal

21

with substantial assistance scenarios.

22

But, instead, what Congress did in

23

Section 3553(e) is refer to 994 as a whole,

24

which includes the entire guidelines system.

25

And if you compare that to the other statutory

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
9
1

provisions on these two pages, 2a and 3a,

2

you'll see that, on page 2a, Congress refers no

3

fewer than four times to particular subsections

4

of 994.

5

So, when Congress wanted to limit a

6

court's authority or to direct it to particular

7

guidelines, provisions, or particular elements

8

of the Commission's authority, Congress did so

9

specifically.

10

By contrast -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Fisher, there's

11

a -- there's an anomaly in the position you

12

take.

13

here, if they were to appear for initial

14

sentencing today, they would get the very same

15

sentence that they got -- that the -- the

16

sentence that they are now serving.

17

seems a little odd that -- that people who, if

18

they were being sentenced today, would get the

19

exact same sentence, should get the benefit of

20

this scale-down.

21

That is, if the defendants involved

MR. FISHER:

So that

Justice Ginsburg, we

22

agree if that were true it would be odd.

23

have to disagree with your premise, and I think

24

this relates to the answer I gave to Justice

25

Sotomayor earlier about how 5G1.1 applies.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

But I

Official
10
1

That argument which the government makes

2

depends on the assumption that the judge

3

sentencing somebody in a courtroom today in

4

this scenario needs to start with the mandatory

5

minimum and work from there.

6

And that's just a false premise.

7

Section 3553(e), as I've quoted to you, the

8

direction is quite to the contrary.

9

sentence the defendant according to the

In

It's to

10

guidelines and to start with the guideline

11

range.

12

the minimum today or for any future sentencing.

13

And 5G1.1 doesn't require starting at

So, in effect, we're asking for our

14

defendants to be given sentence -- sentence

15

modifications that enable them to be given

16

sentences just as they would be in courtroom

17

today.

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. FISHER:

And the government's -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if the district

22

judge specifically disavows any reliance on the

23

guidelines?

24

don't care if the guidelines are subsequently

25

lowered; this is the sentence I'm imposing?

What if the district judge says I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
11
1

MR. FISHER:

Well, two things, Justice

2

Alito.

First of all, that judge would be -- if

3

you're -- if you're talking about a sentence in

4

the first instance, that judge would be

5

violating Section 3553(e), which tells that

6

judge to sentence the defendant according to

7

the guidelines.

I think the only -­

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

9

they're not mandatory any longer.

10

MR. FISHER:

Well, they're not -­

Right.

I think that's

11

the only way a judge might work around that, is

12

to say after Booker, the judge is allowed to

13

set the guidelines entirely aside.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

15

Booker.

16

what?

17

Yeah, so we are after

So that's what the judge says.

MR. FISHER:

Then

I think if the judge set

18

the guidelines entirely aside and said I just

19

flat out disagree with anything the guidelines

20

say and I'm going to give you a certain

21

sentence, maybe I'd have a difficult case on

22

the "based upon" question.

23

of that, where the judge starts with the

24

guideline range or refers to it or uses it as

25

an anchor, I think you're easily within -- and

But anything short

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1

I think the way to solve this problem, we might

2

say -­

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

You'd have a difficult

4

case if the judge says, I disagree with the

5

guidelines, I'm basing my sentence on the

6

Sentencing Reform Act.

7

sentence is not in any way based on the

8

guidelines.

9

a difficult case in saying that that's not -­

It is not based -- my

You'd have -- you would have just

10

MR. FISHER:

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

12

Fair enough.
-- that that's based

on the guidelines?

13

MR. FISHER:

Fair enough.

Maybe it

14

would be even more than difficult.

15

that's a highly unusual scenario, Justice

16

Alito.

17

where the judge does what is more commonly done

18

in -- in a Gall-type situation or all the other

19

situations this Court has seen where you start

20

with the guidelines, and -- and -- and our very

21

case illustrates you usually land within the

22

guidelines, or you vary from the guidelines for

23

one reason or another.

24

"based on."

25

But I think

And so, in all the other scenarios

All of those satisfied

And I think, Justice Alito, the other

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1

thing I would say in response to your concern

2

is remember -- and I think this was emphasized

3

in the first case -- remember all we're arguing

4

here is the defendants should be eligible to go

5

before a district judge and argue for a

6

sentence reduction.

7

If a district judge in that case says

8

to himself, well, look, the guidelines really

9

didn't have any meaningful effect the first

10

time around, that may well be a reason to deny

11

sentence mod -- sentence modification in that

12

context.

13

All we're asking is for judges to be

14

allowed to use their guided discretion given to

15

them by Congress and the Sentencing Commission.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What is the

17

function of the -- the mandatory minimum?

18

Because it seems the guidelines have Sentencing

19

Commission, and that's fine, but mandatory

20

minimum, like it or not, is legislation, and it

21

seems to be vanishing in your approach.

22

Instead of being -- instead of trump -­

23

trumping whatever would be the guidelines, it's

24

out of the picture.

25

MR. FISHER:

Justice Ginsburg, of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

course, the -- a mandatory minimum in a statute

2

trumps the guidelines in every -- and in the

3

ordinary situation.

4

situation of substantial assistance motions

5

being granted under 3553(e).

6

situation, as the Court put it in Dorsey,

7

allows the defendant to escape the minimum.

8
9

But we're in the special

And that special

Another way to think about it, Justice
Ginsburg, is we're not doing any -- we're not

10

avoiding any trumping problem, because we have

11

two statutes that have to work together.

12

is the mandatory minimum statute and the other

13

is Section 3553(e).

14

One

And what the Court said is that -- and

15

I think what the plain text directs -- is that

16

the mandatory minimum is set aside when the

17

substantial assistance motion is granted.

18

And in -- if your own words in Dorsey

19

aren't enough, you can look any number of other

20

places, including the legislative history where

21

we quote statements from Senator Hatch and from

22

President Reagan where he -- who were -- they

23

introduced this.

24

issuances from the Sentencing Commission that

25

we've quoted in our brief.

You can look at various

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

And again and again and again, courts,

2

legislators, administrators, all understand

3

that in the narrow situation of a substantial

4

assistance motion being granted, the mandatory

5

minimum is set aside.

6

that scenario, I want to stress one more time,

7

is the defendant is sentenced just like anybody

8

else.

9
10

And all that happens in

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Fisher, let's

start with that proposition.

11

In my experience, district court

12

judges use a lot of different approaches to

13

sentencing, and I think that many of the

14

surveys and amici brief that you have show

15

that.

16

There are judges who have fixed rules.

17

Perhaps they should or shouldn't.

18

get into that, okay?

19

of them who simply say my rule of thumb is you

20

cooperate 50 percent.

21

deviate, 50 percent.

22

Let's not

But there's a wide berth

And some of them never

How can we say that for those judges,

23

that their sentence was based on the

24

guidelines, so that you're entitled to

25

eligibility?

They based it on the statute -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

they clearly tell you I'm basing it on the

2

statutory minimum.

3

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think for two

4

reasons, Justice Sotomayor.

5

the "based upon" question should be answered

6

according to what the law requires, not

7

necessarily what a judge did, perhaps

8

mistakenly.

9

sentence was required to be based on the

10

So, as a legal matter, the -- the

guidelines, even if the judge didn't do that.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

MR. FISHER:

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

First is we think

But it was the -­

But if your -­
-- guideline at

the time.

15

MR. FISHER:

Well, if your -­

And -- and they

19

lower guideline.

20

side about the many judges who do use the

21

guidelines in substantial assistance.

22

it.

I don't want to use the
I'm going to ask the other

23

MR. FISHER:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

They say

Right.
Prosecutors by

their own admission have gone in to judges and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1

said, base it on the guidelines.

2

So there are plenty of judges who -­

3

who do depart based on the guidelines because

4

they believe that they're more reflective of

5

the seriousness of the crime and give them a

6

better sense of how much of a departure they

7

should or should not give.

8

it informs their decision.

9
10
11

So, in those ways,

But we're not in that case.

We're in

the first type of case.
MR. FISHER:

Right.

So let me say two

12

very important things to that question because

13

I think it's probably the hardest part about

14

this case.

15

The first is that for the very reason

16

you stated, Justice Sotomayor, that there's

17

such wide variance, sometimes not just between

18

districts but between courtrooms in the same

19

courthouse, it would be -- it would be in -- in

20

contravention of the very principles of the

21

Sentencing Reform Act, which say avoid

22

sentencing disparities, to deny relief to some

23

of those defendants and to give other

24

defendants relief, just based on the

25

happenstance of what judge that defendant

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
18
1

happened to adhere -- appear in front of.

2

We think it's a better rule to ask

3

what the law required the judge to do.

4

the law required the judge to consult the

5

guidelines, that should be enough to get into

6

the eligibility of relief.

7

And if

But the second point I want to make,

8

Justice Sotomayor, is even if you want to look

9

at what the judge did on the record, warts and

10

all, mistakes and all, we still win this case.

11

And that's because the judge in our case

12

adjusted up to the mandatory minimum because of

13

5G1.1.

14

was incorrect.

15

And, as I've described, we think that

But even if you accept that as

16

something that happened and something you need

17

to take into account, the Sentencing Commission

18

has addressed that exact scenario in the policy

19

statement that -- that accompanied Amendment

20

782, which brings us here today.

21

And this is in Section 1B1.10(c).

The

22

Sentencing Commission says when you calculate

23

an amended range under the guidelines, pursuant

24

to this amendment, you should disregard 5G1.1

25

and use the range itself and not adjust.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
19
1

So even if we were in a world where we

2

had to argue that in our case, even if the

3

judge made a mistake and relied on a guideline

4

incorrectly, that has been taken care of by the

5

Sentencing Commission amendments.

6

still have a lower guideline range after

7

Amendment 782, which is all that's required to

8

get relief under Section 3582.

9

And so we

And I think that adds one other thing

10

I want to say, and it brings me back to Justice

11

Ginsburg's question about the concern about

12

disparities and who gets relief and who

13

doesn't.

14

We think that our solution actually,

15

for the reasons I just described, avoids

16

sentencing disparities and also avoids

17

sentencing disparities because we're asking for

18

our sentences to be adjusted just as somebody

19

would be sentenced today.

20

As we point out in our briefing,

21

though, the government is the one that creates

22

the disparity problem because, under the

23

government's view, people whose guideline

24

ranges were above the minimum, and even if the

25

judge sentenced below, those people are

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
20
1

eligible for Section 3582 relief.

2

And the only difference between those

3

people and -- and our clients in this case is

4

that the guidelines measured their crimes as

5

being more serious than the ones our clients

6

committed.

7

And we think it would be highly

8

irregular and, in fact, perverse for a court to

9

say for the people who committed more serious

10

offenses but are otherwise identically

11

situated, we are going to grant them relief in

12

sentences reductions, but not the people whose

13

crimes weren't judged to be quite as serious.

14

They are not even allowed to ask the judge to

15

exercise discretion in their favor.

16

So we think that would be a wild

17

anomaly that this Court ought to construe

18

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

3
4

MR. FEIGIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

5

There was very little discussion in

6

the last 20 minutes about anything that

7

happened at these particular Petitioners'

8

sentencings.

9

The sentencing transcripts are

10

entirely in the Joint Appendix.

11

will not find in the sentencing transcripts is

12

any indication that the drug guidelines, that

13

the Sentencing Commission has amended, had any

14

effect on the sentences that these Petitioners

15

received.

16

And what you

In fact, if Petitioners were initially

17

sentenced for the first time today, they'd be

18

subject to the same statutory minimums, the

19

same sentencing ranges under 3553(a)(4), which

20

would be the statutory minimums.

21

that that has changed.

22

subject to the exact same rules for taking into

23

account the -- their substantial assistance to

24

law enforcement in adjusting their sentences.

25

He's wrong

And they would be

The Commission hasn't purported to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
22

change any of that.

2

windfall relief, and they assert that they're

3

entitled to that windfall relief because they

4

claim that the district judge made an error in

5

their cases.

6

What they're seeking is

They're wrong the district judge made

7

an error, and I'll get to that in one second,

8

but even if the district judge had made an

9

error, this Court's decision in Dillon makes

10

quite clear that Section 3582(c)(2) proceedings

11

are not for error correction.

12

sentence reductions in cases in which the

13

sentence was actually based on a sentencing

14

range that the Commission has modified.

15
16
17

They are for

But I agree with Petitioners' counsel
that the crux of this case -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, it is a

18

sentencing range.

19

argument, which is the sentencing range was

20

raised to the statutory minimum.

21

That's the force of their

So the original judge felt bound by

22

that sentencing range because of the statutory

23

minimum, but that became the new guideline.

24
25

MR. FEIGIN:

And if they came before

the court again today for full resentencing,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
23
1

even after Section 1B1.10(c), to which opposing

2

counsel referenced, even after Section

3

1B1.10(c) were enacted, Section 1G1.1 would

4

still require that the statutory minimum be

5

their guideline sentence for purposes of

6

Section 3553(a)(4).

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It misses the next

8

step, which the guidelines say, if you

9

substantially cooperate, the minimum is

10

eliminated.

11

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, first of all, Your

12

Honor, I don't think that's what the guidelines

13

say, but I don't think the guidelines even

14

could say that.

15

under 994(b) have to comply with all relevant

16

provisions of law, which means 5G1.1, setting

17

the guideline sentence at the statutory

18

minimum, isn't optional.

19

the Commission made.

20

required by statute to have a guideline like

21

that.

22

First of all, the guidelines

That's not a choice

The Commission is

But I think the first place to look

23

here before we even get to what the Commission

24

did -- and I don't think the Commission has set

25

forth anything like the instruction he

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
24
1

suggests -- is the language of the statute.

2

And so, if we go to page 3a of the

3

government's brief, they want to read Section

4

3553(e) as though it were written exactly like

5

Section 3553(f), which allows sentencing

6

pursuant to the guidelines without regard to

7

the statutory minimum.

8
9

And they want to benefit even beyond
that.

They not only want sentencing to start

10

at their below-minimum guideline range; they

11

want a further reduction from that point to

12

their substantial assistance.

13

I can get back to the text in one

14

second, but let's pause for a second.

I think

15

that just doesn't make any sense.

16

reason why the reward someone should get for

17

substantial assistance is that a cooperator who

18

has been convicted of an offense for which

19

Congress has prescribed a specific statutory

20

minimum should then by default automatically be

21

presumptively sentenced at the level of a

22

non-cooperator who has been convicted of a

23

different crime that does not carry a statutory

24

minimum, like a non-recidivist version of the

25

drug offense.

There is no

That doesn't make any sense, and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
25
1
2

that's not the text that Congress enacted.
When opposing counsel went through

3

3553(e), he didn't mention the first sentence

4

of 3553(e), under which "the court shall have

5

the authority to impose a sentence below" what

6

a statutory minimum requires "so as to reflect

7

a defendant's substantial assistance."

8
9

The "so as to reflect" language
modifies the sentence the court is imposing.

10

It does not modify the nature of the

11

government's motion.

12

what the court can take into account in

13

imposing a sentence below the minimum.

14

court can only take into account substantial

15

assistance factors.

16

And it's a limitation on

The

And that's exactly how the Commission

17

implemented this, as this Court recognized on

18

pages 128 to -­

19
20
21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, then -- then

what effect does the next sentence have?
MR. FEIGIN:

So what that sentence

22

does, Your Honor, is it notes that the

23

guidelines are going to guide the court's

24

discretion, which is exactly what 5K1.1 does,

25

and it's exactly what this Court recognized

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
26
1

5K1.1 does in its decision in Melendez, if you

2

look at pages 128 to 129 and Note 10.

3

think that point is -­

4
5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And I

But -- but all

the guidelines?

6

MR. FEIGIN:

Yes, in your -­

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Not -- not

8

just 5K1.1.

And if you do look at it, in -- in

9

other places immediately surrounding this, it

10

does say 994 and then the subsections, and here

11

it just says 994.

12

MR. FEIGIN:

So there's a reason -­

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Which suggests

14

that all of the guidelines should be taken into

15

account.

16

MR. FEIGIN:

I -- I -- I do think this

17

was effectively settled in Melendez, Your

18

Honor, but addressed as a matter of first

19

principles.

20

we now look at 994(n), which is on page 14a of

21

the government's brief, 994(n) says:

22

Commission shall assure that the guidelines,"

23

writ large, "reflect the general

24

appropriateness of imposing a lower sentence

25

than would otherwise be imposed, including a

I think the reason for that is if

the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
27
1

sentence that is lower than that established by

2

a statute as a minimum sentence, to take into

3

account a defendant's substantial assistance."

4

So just to address your question,

5

Mr. Chief Justice, first, before I get back to

6

the rest of this, you'll note that 994(n)

7

directs the Commission to do something with the

8

guidelines writ large.

9

3553(e) -- that was in 1986 -- there were no

10

guidelines -- final guidelines that had been

11

promulgated at that point.

12

When Congress enacted

The Commission had a great deal of

13

discretion in how it might have decided to

14

implement 994(n), and it might have sprinkled

15

substantial assistance reductions and ways of

16

doing that for particular types of crimes all

17

over the guidelines.

18

the Commission had to promulgate specific

19

guidelines to implement 994(n), although that

20

is, as this Court recognized in Melendez, what

21

they chose to do.

22

So I don't even know that

The other thing -- and this is back to

23

Justice Kennedy's question -- when we look at

24

994(n), is I think it recognizes that

25

substantial assistance sentencing works exactly

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
28
1

the way we describe.

2

would be a sentence that would otherwise be

3

imposed, and it gives as an example a -- the

4

sentence that the statutory minimum would

5

require.

6

It recognizes that there

And then it tells the guidelines, and,

7

effectively, this goes back to the "reflects"

8

language that I was pointing out earlier in

9

3553(e), it instructs the Commission and the

10

courts that then what's going to happen is that

11

the court will give a sentence that is lower

12

than that, that reflects or takes into account

13

substantial assistance.

14

Again -­

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But one other point

16

that I think Justice Sotomayor made earlier,

17

that, in fact -- and, in fact, it's in one of

18

the briefs -- that the district judges do take

19

into account the guidelines when they grant -­

20

when they determine how much time to include

21

for substantial assistance.

22

MR. FEIGIN:

So, Your Honor, 11 -- all

23

11 courts of appeals that have directly

24

addressed this question agree with our view of

25

how substantial assistance sentencing works.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
29
1

They say the D.C. Circuit has said otherwise.

2

I don't think that's correct.

3

But I acknowledge, as Your Honor said

4

and as we acknowledge in our brief, there are

5

district courts that do this the way that

6

Mr. Fisher just described.

7

acknowledge that in those cases, the government

8

often is an accomplice to that by suggesting

9

that the court do it that way.

And I also would

10

And I can't tell you -- but I think we

11

all agree -- and they acknowledge this in their

12

reply brief -- that they're doing that out of

13

compliance with circuit law.

14

you how they got out of circuit law compliance

15

in the first place.

16

And I can't tell

What I can tell you is a reason why I

17

think this persists, is that it just doesn't

18

come up on appeal that often because, when you

19

do it the way that they think it should be done

20

and that some of these district courts do, the

21

defendant's not going to appeal because it's to

22

his benefit.

23

And from the government's perspective,

24

we don't frequently appeal sentences, and when

25

we do, it's not to vindicate abstract

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
30
1

principles of law.

2

sentence that was imposed is a sentence that

3

shouldn't have been imposed and was just flatly

4

outside the judge's discretion.

5

It's if we think the

And so we've essentially gotten to a

6

place where, in at least some districts, the

7

government is attempting to just achieve the

8

sentencing results it believes are correct by

9

speaking to district courts -­

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Feigin, you're

11

just answering the very question, which is,

12

you're right, there's a lot of judges, and I

13

don't know that that's an abuse of discretion.

14

You're already saying it's not a gross abuse of

15

discretion or otherwise you would be appealing.

16

So you're not doing that.

17

It seems to me that the guidelines

18

don't help a judge in their words to determine

19

how much of a departure is just right, and

20

judges have to figure that out by having some

21

basis of comparison with something.

22

What if the -- because they give you

23

five factors to consider.

You've got someone

24

who does a lot on Number 1, does a little on

25

Number 2, does a whole lot more on Number 3,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
31
1

and then nothing on 4.

2

all up and says:

3

The judge mixes that

How much do I depart?

And the next defendant will have a

4

different mix, and the same question comes up.

5

And what I see judges doing is saying the

6

severity of this crime is measured most

7

accurately by the guidelines.

8

sampling across the country of how serious this

9

crime is.

It's based on a

Now I'm going to take that and

10

compare it to all of those other factors, and

11

I'm going to decide a percentage, both based on

12

the statutory minimum but also on the

13

guideline, of how much seems right to me.

14

So I -- it's not an abuse of

15

discretion in my view.

16

do we do to ensure the equity that Mr. Fisher

17

is calling for?

18
19
20

MR. FEIGIN:

And if it's not, what

Well, Your Honor, let me

say a few things about that.
The first thing I would say is when I

21

was referring to the kinds of abuses of

22

discretion we would appeal, there's usually a

23

substantive component to that.

24

actual sentence and see if it's a sentence we

25

can live with.

We look to the

And if it's a sentence we can

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
32
1

live with, we -- that is what I was

2

referencing.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

MR. FEIGIN:

5
6
7
8
9

Yeah, because -­

And, Your Honor, I -- I

-- I think it's -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- there's

different ways to get to the same reduction.
MR. FEIGIN:

And I think -- exactly.

And even if the judge got there an

10

impermissible way, we're not necessarily going

11

to take an appeal just to vindicate an abstract

12

principle of law, even though in 11 circuits,

13

if we took that appeal, we'd win on procedural

14

grounds because they agree with us about how

15

these statutes should be read.

16

Now, Your Honor, in the situation you

17

described where a judge did perform the

18

substantial assistance reduction a way we think

19

is impermissible -- and in a second, I'd -- I'd

20

like to get back to the reasons why we think

21

it's impermissible, but I'd like to address

22

your question directly -- we don't think

23

Section 3852(c)(2) relief would be available

24

because we don't think 3582(c)(2) requires a

25

court to repeat the same mistake twice.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
33
1

That defendant already got a

2

substantial benefit because the court was

3

looking to an even lower range than the court

4

should have looked to, and they don't need to

5

get, and shouldn't in Congress's view, get the

6

benefit again.

7

There are two legal reasons why I

8

think that is so under the statutes.

The first

9

reason is I don't think in that case their

10

sentence can properly be said to be based on

11

that below-minimum guideline range because the

12

below-minimum guideline range didn't have any

13

legal force in their sentence.

14

have been applied in their sentence.

15

It shouldn't

If you think about the function of

16

3582(c)(2), it's to give defendants the benefit

17

of the Commission's change in its views about

18

how a particular class of offenders and

19

offenses should be punished.

20

And although the guidelines' view of

21

how that particular class of offenders and

22

offenses should be punished has changed,

23

Congress's superseding view should not be

24

changed.

25

these defendants, based on their criminal

Again, Congress has decided that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
34
1

histories and based on the crimes they

2

committed, are subject to these statutory

3

minimums.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

I see that point.

I

And I

think your argument is perhaps the refutation

of it.

8

tax code, despite the continuous effort

9

necessary to number after number after number.

But I think the guidelines are not the

10

So -- but I'm not saying you shouldn't

11

do it.

You have to.

12

the fact is here the guide -- the Commission

13

made a simple decision and so did Congress.

14

But -- but the -- the -­

The drug guidelines were too high, so

15

we're going to lower them two points.

16

want people to be resentenced.

17

really anything to do with that, I'm saying

18

based upon read it broadly, why?

19

MR. FEIGIN:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

And we

If it has

Well -­
Because there's only

21

one person who knows really what that was based

22

upon, and that's the district judge who put the

23

sentence.

24
25

And we can't psychoanalyze him.
And we try to proceed case-by-case in

three kinds of instances.

One, he used the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

guidelines.

2

That's easy.

Two, he departed from the guidelines.

3

Was he looking at it when he departed?

4

know.

5
6
7

I don't

He knows.
Three, this kind of case, departure

from the statutory minimum.
Now, since we're never going to know,

8

really, and all we have to do if you read it

9

broadly "based upon," is send it back so that

10

judge himself or herself can resentence.

11

by the way, Judge, when you resentence, if the

12

guidelines had nothing to do with this, don't

13

change the sentence.

14

And,

Now that seems to be practical,

15

prevents every case from trying to

16

psychoanalyze the judge, prevents us from

17

hearing appeal after appeal like the appellate

18

courts would certainly have to, and, anyway,

19

this is, you know, common sense as to how

20

they're supposed to work.

21

permit it?

22

Judge, in the departures, you start with the

23

guideline.

24
25

Yes.

Does the statute

Because the statute says:

Because the statute says here:

Judge,

in the language he read, you start with the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
36

guideline.

2

will never use it and maybe somebody will say

3

60 months no matter what.

4

Now maybe some won't.

Good.

Maybe some

You, Judge, want to do that.

5

Do it on remand, do it when you reconsider, if

6

it's legal.

7

MR. FEIGIN:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9
10

Three points -­
Now that's a very

simple -- you see, it's -- it's a little
complicated to say, but you see what I'm doing?

11

MR. FEIGIN:

Three points, Justice -­

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

MR. FEIGIN:

What's your response?

-- Breyer.

First,

14

there's no need to psychoanalyze the judge if

15

the result of the psychoanalysis would be that

16

the judge implemented the law incorrectly.

17

don't get relief for that, so that -- in order

18

to have the court make the same mistake twice.

19

You

The second thing I'd say is it is a

20

very strange scheme in which the Commission's

21

judgment that the drug sentences are too high

22

is implemented only in the cases of

23

cooperators.

24
25

If you think of two defendants, each
subject to the statutory minimum -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
37
1

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, your -- your -­

2

your -- your -- I sometimes speak more broadly

3

than I should.

I don't mean really carry in a

4

psychoanalyst.

What I really mean is you look

5

at all these things he wrote in different

6

things and try and put it together.

7

mean in every case they wanted to lower it.

8

They wanted to lower it in these cases.

9

-- that's -- you're right about that.

10

MR. FEIGIN:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12
13

Nor do I

That's

Your Honor -­
I still have the same

question.
MR. FEIGIN:

-- and my basic -- my

14

basic point is if the judge considered

15

something the judge should not have considered,

16

that is not a reason, and it -- particularly

17

where it benefitted the defendant, that's not a

18

reason for a 3582(c)(2) reduction.

19

The second thing is, just to your

20

instinct that these defendants should get their

21

sentences lowered, if you consider other

22

defendants -­

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm not saying that.

24

I'm saying send it back to the judge because he

25

or she is the one who knows whether this was

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
38
1

really significantly influenced by the

2

guidelines or not, and, therefore, you can -­

3

they -- the judge can impose the sentence he

4

really wants to impose.

5

MR. FEIGIN:

Your Honor, even under

6

that approach, the only ones you're going to be

7

able to send back are the cases in which there

8

was a statutory minimum and there was a 3553(e)

9

motion, so you're going to wind up with a very

10

strange scheme where -- where the Commission's

11

judgment that the drug sentences are too

12

high -- and I think the district court judge

13

who is no friend to statutory minimums made

14

this point -- said that it's a very strange

15

scheme where the Commission's judgment that the

16

drug sentences are too high is implemented only

17

in the case of cooperators.

18

Amendment 782 says nothing about

19

cooperation or differentiating between two

20

defendants subject to statutory minimums

21

because one cooperated and one didn't.

22

But let me get back to 3553(e) and why

23

it doesn't instruct a court -- and I think it

24

couldn't instruct a court -- to start with the

25

below-minimum guideline range as the starting

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
39
1

point for the departure, to reward a cooperator

2

twice, once by treating him like he didn't

3

commit a different crime, and the second time

4

by giving him a substantial assistance

5

departure, and I guess a third time on

6

Petitioners' view by giving him a sentence

7

reduction that has nothing to do with his

8

cooperation.

9

The reason it couldn't work that way

10

is, although the guidelines are not mandatory

11

now, and we understand that is a constitutional

12

ruling, Congress implemented this against the

13

backdrop of guidelines it believed were

14

mandatory.

15

Now imagine a case in which a

16

defendant is subject to a 60-month statutory

17

minimum and the judge thinks:

18

defendant did provide substantial assistance,

19

not a great deal, I'd probably give him a year

20

off.

21

were up to me.

22

You know, this

I'd give him a 48-month sentence if it

Now imagine his guidelines range

23

calculation, if the statutory minimum did not

24

exist, were 24 to 30 months.

25

Under their scheme, you'd start with

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
40
1

-- the judge would then be faced with a

2

dilemma.

3

substantial assistance motion, he has a range

4

where not only the -- where he's actually stuck

5

pretty much with that range.

6

could have done an upward departure under the

7

mandatory guidelines system because he didn't

8

provide that much substantial assistance.

If he decides he's going to grant the

I don't think you

9

So the judge either has to give a

10

sentence of 30 months that he thinks is 18

11

months too low, or he can deny the substantial

12

assistance motion altogether and impose a

13

sentence that he thinks is 12 months too high.

14

I don't think there's any reason to

15

think that Congress was implementing a scheme

16

like that when it enacted Section 3553(e).

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, if you're -­

18

you're right about that, but then the

19

guidelines and policy statements, which is what

20

it says, have all kinds of things in them,

21

including negative things.

22

this.

You shouldn't do

You can't do that.

23

And my thought is, once we go down the

24

road that you're saying, which is examining, as

25

you've done, a sentencing transcript in case

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
41
1

after case, that way lies a kind of legal

2

perdition because did he -- did the judge, for

3

example, do the thing or did he think of doing

4

the thing which the guideline says you

5

shouldn't do?

6

And -- and you see the complexity of

7

second-guessing that seems worse, perhaps, from

8

the point of view of what Congress would have

9

wanted, if they'd thought of it -­

10

MR. FEIGIN:

Well -­

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- than giving "based

12

upon the guidelines and policy statements" a

13

pretty broad meaning.

14

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, I don't

15

think I'm pointing the Court down the road to

16

perdition here.

We have a very clear view -­

17

(Laughter.)

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. FEIGIN:

Quite right.

-- of how substantial

20

assistance sentencing should work, which,

21

again, is the view of the 11 -- all 11 courts

22

of appeals that have squarely addressed it.

23

And under that view, we think it doesn't matter

24

what the judge may have had in his mind.

25

You can't -- as we've acknowledged

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
42
1

when this was up for debate before the

2

Sentencing Commission, you know, judges may

3

have a lot of things in their minds, and some

4

of them are permissible considerations and some

5

of them are not, and I think we trust that

6

district judges at the end of the day should

7

have complied with the law.

8

did comply with the law.

9

We presume they

And if -- even if it's apparent that

10

they made a mistake and that the mistake

11

benefitted the defendant, we don't go back and

12

give the defendant even further relief on the

13

basis of that mistake.

14
15

And that -- and, here, there was no
mistake at all.

16

I think -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, why -- why is

17

that, Mr. Feigin?

18

speaks in terms of questions of historical

19

fact.

20

not what you were sentenced -- you know, what

21

-- what your sentence should have been based

22

on.

23

I -- I mean, this language

It's what you were sentenced based on,

And as to giving defendants some

24

further benefit, I mean, you had an opportunity

25

to appeal.

And one might say that by thinking

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
43
1

about what should have happened, what you are

2

doing is seeking a form of collateral review

3

that you are not entitled to at this point.

4

MR. FEIGIN:

So, Your Honor, first of

5

all, I -- I know you understand this, but we're

6

now talking about a case that is not like this

7

case.

8

they haven't really made one, that their -­

9

their sentences were based on the guidelines as

10

In this case, they have no argument, and

a matter of historical fact.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's true, but

12

that's a different argument from the one you

13

are making in general.

I mean -­

14

MR. FEIGIN:

Yes.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I -­

-- you started off by

16

saying look at the transcript.

17

on that.

18

shouldn't be looking at what it was based on.

19

We should only be looking at what it should

20

have been based on.

21

It wasn't based

But you've moved to saying we

And I guess my question is, textually,

22

why is that true?

23

structurally, why should it be true, given, you

24

know, sort of like a second shot at an appeal?

25

And sort of, you know,

MR. FEIGIN:

So there are -- there are

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
44
1

a couple of reasons, Your Honor.

2

to be clear that we're talking about a case

3

that's not this one.

4

I just wanted

There are a couple of reasons.

One is

5

just -- just as a practical matter, you would

6

be requiring the government to appeal even

7

sentences it thought it was substantively fine

8

with and could live with, just to preserve down

9

the road some procedural objection to

10
11

3582(c)(2) relief.
And I don't think that's a great use

12

of the courts of appeals' time or, frankly, the

13

-- the government's own resources.

14

are two statutory reasons why I don't think

15

that that approach is the right one.

16

But there

One is the one I was discussing with

17

Justice Sotomayor earlier, which is that I

18

don't think a sentence can be said to be based

19

on; that is, the legal foundation of -- the

20

guidelines aren't the legal foundation of the

21

sentence if they're not even the guidelines

22

that the -- the court was required to apply.

23

So, again, 3582(c)(2) -­

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

I guess I don't quite

understand that just as a matter of language,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1
2

something can be based on a legal error.
MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, here, I

3

think "based on a sentencing range" actually

4

has a very specific meaning.

5

in the first section of our brief and as

6

Petitioners never really respond to in their

7

reply brief, "sentencing range" is a term

8

that's only used in three different places in

9

the statute.

10

As we point out

And the -- I think the relevant places

11

here are, one, we see it in 3582(c)(2).

12

also see it in Section 3553(a)(4) as the thing

13

that the guideline -- the number that the

14

guidelines give back to you or the range of

15

numbers in most cases that the guidelines give

16

back to you under 3553(a)(4).

17

We

And I think "based on the sentencing

18

range" means that the number that 3553(a)(4)

19

gave back to the district judge, when he

20

computed the guidelines, was actually the

21

number -- it should actually be that number.

22

And where there was an error there, I don't

23

think 3582(c)(2) should be applied to give the

24

defendant further relief.

25

And the reason for that is the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
46
1

guidelines, the third place "sentencing range"

2

is used, are required to return a sentencing

3

range to the district judge that complies with

4

all statutory law.

5

And when the Commission changes a

6

guidelines range, it only has permission to do

7

so outside the context of statutory minimums.

8

And so the whole function of 3582(c)(2) is to

9

give defendants the benefit of judgments that

10

the Commission has made that would change their

11

sentences if they were sentenced properly for

12

the first time today.

13

par with sentence -- defendants who are getting

14

sentenced properly for the first time today.

15

And that puts them on

It doesn't really make sense to give

16

them relief where the Commission's changed a

17

judgment that shouldn't have had any effect on

18

their sentences to begin with.

19

The second legal operative rule I

20

would suggest here, and this is specific to the

21

context of statutory minimums, is that nothing

22

in Section 3582(c)(2) itself or any related

23

statute allows the Commission to grant

24

retroactive sentencing relief that would allow

25

a defendant to receive a sentence that is below

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
47
1
2

a statutory minimum.
They don't claim that the Commission

3

could write a rule that says everyone who is

4

sentenced to a 20-year statutory minimum under

5

21 U.S.C. 841 now gets a 10-year sentence.

6

Instead, to the extent they're relying

7

on the ability of the Commission or the judge

8

to recommend or impose a sentence that is below

9

the statutory minimum, they're relying on

10
11

Section 3553(e).
And for the reasons I've given and am

12

happy to get back to and -- and perhaps add a

13

few more, Section 3553(e) does not remove the

14

mandatory minimum for all purposes.

15

What it allows is a sentence that

16

reflects or takes account of substantial

17

assistance.

18

statutory minimum and the sentence the

19

defendant actually receives has to be based on

20

substantial assistance factors.

21

And the entire delta between the

Neither the guidelines, I think, nor

22

dare I say common sense suggest that one of

23

those factors should be the sentence that a

24

non-cooperating defendant would have received

25

had he been convicted of a crime that Congress

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
48
1

did not deem serious enough to warrant a

2

statutory minimum.

3

We can disagree -- we don't -- but one

4

could disagree, as the district judge did, with

5

the policy wisdom of some of these statutory

6

minimum sentences, but the fact remains that in

7

the eyes of Congress, a defendant who has

8

committed an offense like these Petitioners did

9

with the criminal history that these

10

Petitioners have has committed an offense that

11

warrants a particular statutory minimum.

12

Section -­

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

There's one -­

14

there's one small point I didn't quite

15

understand.

16

Justice Kagan, you indicated that if this had

17

to go back to the district judge, per Justice

18

Breyer's common sense approach, that that would

19

mean that the government in -- at the first

20

sentencing hearing would have to make all of

21

its arguments or it waived them?

22

In the course of your answer to

I thought it was just a new sentencing

23

procedure.

You could say:

Well now, Your

24

Honor, the first time you had this sentence, we

25

thought that we made our case and we did, but

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
49
1

there are many other things you could consider.

2

You -- you could say that in the second

3

hearing, couldn't you?

4

MR. FEIGIN:

I'm not sure that we

5

could, Your Honor, because the Court made clear

6

in Dillon it's not a complete resentencing.

7

You essentially do everything the same way you

8

did at the first sentencing and just substitute

9

in the -­

10

Is there any

11

authority I could look to to see if there's

12

this waiver?

said you have to preserve all these points.

16

you can't -­

MR. FEIGIN:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19
20

So

Well, I was responding -­
-- do them on round

2, that you're barred on round 2?
MR. FEIGIN:

So Dillon addresses the

21

fact that this isn't a full resentencing

22

proceeding.

23

Kagan's suggestion that the government had

24

effectively acquiesced to Section 3582(c)(2)

25

relief when it, in a case, again, not this

And I was responding to Justice

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
50
1

case, where substantial assistance sentencing

2

was done improperly and the government hadn't

3

appealed.

4

I -- I'd also like to quickly address

5

opposing counsel's suggestion that we're

6

creating sentencing disparities.

7

they're creating sentencing disparities in

8

three different ways.

9

I think

The first is a timing disparity.

10

Again, under our view of how substantial

11

assistance works, which is the law of all the

12

circuits that have addressed it, and I think

13

the only fair reading of the statutes, they

14

would have a very strange timing disparity

15

where they're entitled to Section 3582(c)(2)

16

relief simply because they were sentenced

17

before Amendment 782, whereas identically

18

situated defendants sentenced today wouldn't

19

get relief.

20

this out earlier.

21

I think Justice Ginsburg pointed

The second disparity that I think

22

exists here is the one I was pointing out to

23

Justice Breyer, which is that you have

24

Amendment 782, which has nothing to do with

25

cooperators and only has to do with the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
51
1

appropriate sentences for defendants convicted

2

of drug crimes, and yet the -- as to two

3

different defendants, both of whom Congress

4

believed committed the same crime and deserved

5

the same statutory minimum, only the cooperator

6

gets the benefit of the Commission's judgment

7

on a matter that the Commission's judgment

8

isn't controlling because we know what Congress

9

specifically thought because there's a

10
11

statutory minimum.
And the third disparity is one I've

12

mentioned a few times here today, which is

13

that, again, I think there would be an anomaly

14

in their view of how substantial assistance

15

sentencing works.

16

Even if we get rid of that very odd

17

situation that I think would come up quite a

18

bit when the guidelines were mandatory and

19

shows Congress couldn't have intended it to

20

work the way they're suggesting, I still think

21

it is very odd for Congress to have enacted a

22

statute that would allow a defendant who is

23

sentenced to a statutory minimum and then

24

cooperates to presumptively receive a sentence

25

-- the same sentence if he had -- that he would

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
52
1

have gotten if he hadn't cooperated and if he

2

committed a different crime.

3

Section 3553(f) illustrates that

4

Congress knew exactly how to write language of

5

the sort the Petitioners want to read into

6

3553(e).

7

Although 3553(f) was enacted later,

8

they're not unrelated provisions.

They're the

9

only two provisions of Section 3553(e) that

10

allow sentencing below a minimum -- that allow

11

sentencing below a minimum under any

12

circumstances.

13

have viewed them as related.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

19

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

20

MR. FISHER:

Thank -­

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Fisher, make

22

the following assumptions.

Rejecting your

23

argument that the substantial assistance has to

24

start from the amended guideline down, let's

25

assume we accept the government, and the 11

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
53
1

circuits who have ruled this way, that it has

2

to start from the statutory minimum.

3

assume further that some of those circuits have

4

said that the court can't even consider the

5

guideline range in determining how much of a

6

discount to give, and that was wrong.

7

with all factors, a district court can consider

8

what it wants in determining, for all the

9

reasons I said earlier, how much of a discount

10

to give can be informed by the guideline range

11

in some way.

12

But

That, as

Where would that put your clients?

13

Because it's -- I'm not clear that -- and to be

14

frank with you, it wasn't something I was

15

paying attention to when I read the sentencing

16

transcripts.

17

attorneys in these cases below actually argued

18

anything different than you did today, which

19

would be rejected.

20

argument that the guide -- that they properly

21

raised an argument that the guidelines should

22

inform the departure from -- from the maximum.

23

A, I'm not clear that the defense

That didn't raise an

MR. FISHER:

So the answer to your

24

question, where that would put my clients,

25

Justice Sotomayor, would be that this Court

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
54
1

should vacate the judgment and remand, as

2

Justice Breyer suggested, for the district

3

court to answer the question whether the

4

guidelines had some magnetic pull or -- or

5

influence on the ultimate sentence granted.

6

And remember for three -­

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

And why can't you

tell -­
MR. FISHER:

-- of them, it actually

ended in -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- why can't you

tell that from reading the transcript?
MR. FISHER:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

14

think that the transcript, if anything,

15

suggests that it did because three of the

16

defendants, three of the five defendants here,

17

actually ended up with within guideline range

18

sentences.

19

And -- and for the only -- and for one

20

of them that the judge deviated from that,

21

Mr. Gutierrez, the judge actually said -­

22

partly because he didn't think the guidelines

23

properly measured the offense.

24

anything, we would win, but I think out of an

25

abundance of caution in the way that Section

So, if

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
55
1

3582 applies, you might just send it back to

2

the district judge, but -­

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, all of

4

them basically were the first type of judge I

5

mentioned earlier, I thought virtually all of

6

them, except that one, the judge said I give a

7

percentage on.

8
9

MR. FISHER:

Right.

Right, so I think

then you have the question that the government

10

itself raised when this was in front of the

11

Sentencing Commission, which is that even if

12

the judge characterizes the departure in terms

13

of a percentage, the judge may have in the back

14

of her mind where that percentage leads in

15

terms of the guideline range.

16

not a coincidence that three of the five

17

sentences here ended up in the guideline range.

18

And I think it's

And I think, Justice Sotomayor, just

19

to reinforce the question that you asked, I

20

think it would be a highly undesirable and just

21

improper rule to say that the only two things

22

that can go into sentencing in a case like this

23

are the mandatory minimum and the 5K

24

substantial assistance factors, because there

25

the judge would be required to give the maximum

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
56
1

downward departure in every single case based

2

on those 5K factors, regardless of how serious

3

the crime was.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

MR. FISHER:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

That clearly -­

That would be very odd.
That -- that's

what I said earlier -­

8

MR. FISHER:

Yes.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- which there has

10

to be a little bit more.

The question is:

11

What are you comparing against?

12

MR. FISHER:

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14
15

Right.
And what are the

factors you're weighing?
MR. FISHER:

Right.

So I think if we

16

grant the government all of its legal

17

arguments, even there, as the Third Circuit

18

said in Winebarger, the guideline has some

19

effect on the ultimate sentence, at least to

20

the degree, as Justice Breyer was pointing out,

21

the district judge should have another look.

22

But if I could return to the main

23

argument I -- I made here because I -- I think

24

I understand the Court may be a little bit

25

perplexed at what it has in front of us.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

The

Official
57
1

Court granted a -- a case dealing with Section

2

3582, but what really happens in this case

3

is -- is -- is everything turns, at least set

4

-- setting aside what we just discussed, but

5

everything in the first instance turns on

6

Section 3553(e).

7

how Section 3553(e) works.

8
9

And so it all comes down to

Now the government keeps saying 11
circuits, 11 circuits.

If you look at those

10

opinions, you'll find that only a few of them

11

have any reasoning in terms of Section 3553(e),

12

and I think it is quite clear the D.C. Circuit

13

has disagreed.

14

need to resolve about Section 3553(e).

15

So you have a circuit split you

And if I could just read you one more

16

time -- I think the language, which hard -­

17

Congress could hardly speak more clearly, at

18

page 3a when it says "Such sentence shall be

19

imposed in accordance with the guidelines and

20

policy statements issued by the Commission

21

pursuant to Section 994."

22

So the -- so the government -- so

23

Mr. Feigin made a few responses, and I want to

24

go through them one by one, to that statutory

25

language.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
58
1

First, he said, well, I overlooked the

2

first sentence, which contains a phrase saying

3

that the sentence shall reflect the defendant's

4

substantial assistance.

5

Well, two points about that.

First of

6

all, as we pointed out in our brief, the word

7

"reflect," simply as a textual matter, can mean

8

just to make apparent.

9

sentence is lower than the mandatory minimum is

10

what makes apparent the fact that the defendant

11

granted substantial assistance.

12

you thought the word "reflect" was ambiguous, I

13

would just return you again to the second

14

sentence, which is a directive straight to the

15

district court telling the district court how

16

to impose the sentence.

17

And the fact the

And even if

The next argument Mr. Feigin made was

18

that, well, Melendez forecloses the reading

19

that I've just given you.

20

the case.

That wasn't the issue in front of

21

Melendez.

And, indeed, it wasn't even what the

22

government argued in Melendez.

23

reply brief a few times that the government

24

argued that the second sentence of Section

25

3553(e) just requires the judge to give a

And that's just not

We cite in our

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
59
1

sentence according to the guidelines, as

2

opposed to the pre-guideline system of having

3

free rein to issue any sentence the judge

4

wants.

5

So, again, what the government argued

6

in Melendez and what Footnote 9 and other

7

places in the opinion, to the extent the Court

8

spoke to it at all, I think the better -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. FISHER:

Mr. Fisher -­

-- reading of Melendez is

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

because that's the strongest argument in my

14

mind that the government has.

15

counter by saying it's a later provision to

16

this one.

17

of the circuit holding that's close to

18

unanimous, not quite, that (e) starts from the

20

to change (f) to exclude statutory minimum, it

21

could have, at the very same time, done it to

22

(e) if it disagreed with the majority of

23

circuits.

And I know you

But it's a later provision in light

MR. FISHER:

Right.

25

responses, Justice Sotomayor.

So -- so three
First of all,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

1

Section (f) was enacted in 1994 and I think

2

there were very few circuits that had spoken to

3

the (e) issue at that point.

4

authority the government cites comes later.

5

And, indeed, what you find in those cases are

6

courts comparing (e) and (f) and thinking that

7

(e) means something different than (f).

8

that's what's driven them off the rails, is the

9

existence of (f).

10

Almost all the

And so

Our position, to start with as a

11

statutory matter, is (e) has to mean what it

12

meant for the first eight years before (f) was

13

ever enacted; (f) can't have changed what (e)

14

means.

15

But if you do want to compare them -­

16

so we think you shouldn't compare them, but if

17

you do want to compare them, the operative

18

language in (f) is almost identical to the

19

operative language in (e).

20

"The court shall impose a sentence pursuant to

21

the guidelines promulgated" under -- by the

22

Sentencing Commission under -- "under section

23

994."

24

that -- that's in the second sentence of

25

subsection (e).

It says that the -­

It's almost precisely the same language

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
61
1

And so then all the government is left

2

with is, well, language before that in (f)

3

talks about without regard to the mandatory

4

minimum, whereas what we have in subsection (e)

5

is language that says the court has the

6

authority to sentence below the mandatory

7

minimum.

8

And the question I think that you

9

would be asking is:

Do those two things mean

10

anything different?

And we think the answer is

11

no, because -- and this goes to -- even more to

12

what Mr. Feigin was saying -- the whole point

13

of a mandatory minimum is to set a floor, and

14

so either you have a floor or you don't.

15

And once Congress tells you, you don't

16

have a floor anymore, there's no work left for

17

a mandatory minimum to do.

18

court has the authority to sentence below a

19

mandatory minimum is -- is the functional

20

equivalent of saying:

21

to the mandatory minimum because that's the

22

only thing a mandatory minimum can do, is set a

23

floor.

24
25

So saying that a

sentence without regard

So, once it's gone, it's simply gone.
It doesn't come back to life.

2

somehow still has some pull on the sentencing

-- on the sentencing judge's discretion.

4

And the -- and I think that -- that

5

all of what I'm saying is reinforced, as the

6

Chief Justice pointed earlier, to the -- and I

7

pointed earlier to the points in the -- in the

8

Section 3553(e) provisions where Congress

9

points directly to subsets of 994.

10

It doesn't point directly to Section

11

994(n), which would support the regime

said in Dorsey.

20

there are two ways for a judge and a defendant

21

to escape a mandatory minimum.

22

and the other is sub (f).

23

treated them as equivalent.

24
25

And what's what the Court itself
In Dorsey, the Court said

One is sub (e)

And the Court

So I want to make two final points.
The last point, aside from all these legal

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1

points that Mr. Feigin made and the government

2

makes, was a policy argument that it would be a

3

double benefit of sorts for cooperators to have

4

their sentences pegged under (e) to a guideline

5

and then perhaps depart it down from that.

6

We just disagree with that premise.

7

Remember, it's not a -- the benefit of

8

cooperation is to be treated just like anybody

9

else.

It's not a double benefit.

It's just a

10

benefit -- it's just telling the court, look,

11

if you have a cooperator, take away the

12

mandatory minimum and sentence him just as you

13

would sentence anybody else.

14

Now the judge would have discretion to

15

give that defendant a within guideline range or

16

the judge would have discretion, if there were

17

exceptional cooperation, to go below the

18

guideline range.

19

discretion, and Congress has just given the

20

court the ordinary discretion that somebody

21

else would have.

22

But that's in the court's

Another way to think about what (e)

23

does is it says we want all cooperators treated

24

the same.

25

is subject to a mandatory minimum or not, we

Regardless of whether the cooperator

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64
1

want to lift the mandatory minimum for those

2

who are and just have them sentenced according

3

to the guidelines.

4

important to the justice system.

5

government relies on them heavily.

6

when a -- when a defendant makes the very

7

difficult choice to cooperate, we want that

8

defendant treated just like anybody else.

9

So cooperators are very
The
And so,

And one last thing on the policy is

10

that he said, well, our -- our result running

11

the section -- through Section 3582 would be to

12

give only cooperators the benefit of the

13

Sentencing Commission's drug guideline

14

reduction.

15

For all defendants who are subject to a

16

mandatory minimum but whose guideline range

17

were above the mandatory minimum, they too get

18

the benefit of section -- of -- of Amendment

19

782 regardless of whether they cooperated.

20

I think the government admitted that in its

21

brief, so that's just a small inaccuracy I

22

wanted to correct.

23

That's just factually inaccurate.

And

And the one last point I wanted to

24

make was to go back to Justice Kagan, your

25

question about "based upon" being a question of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
65
1

historical fact.

And this seems to be one

2

point where I think we and the government are,

3

in a sense, agreeing, which is we think that

4

that's one way to read the text, but it's not

5

the better way to read the text.

6

And the better way to read the text is

7

to ask what the law required in that situation,

8

for the reasons I've said and for some of the

9

reasons Mr. Feigin have said.

But if you're

10

unpersuaded by that, I want to reiterate what

11

we say in our opening brief and then -- and

12

then say it again at page 15 and 16 of our

13

reply brief, which is:

14

as a historical question, exactly what the

15

judge did, warts and all, we win.

16

If you want to do this,

And the reason why is because the

17

judge adjusted the guideline sentences in our

18

cases according to Subsection 5G1.1 and the

19

Commission, as part of its amendments to 782

20

and the policy statements accompanying it, said

21

when you calculate an amendment -- an amended

22

guideline range, you do not include Section

23

5G1.1 as part of that calculation.

24

So we have explained to the Court, and

25

I don't think it's rebuttable, that even if you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
66
1

take the mistake the judge made in the first

2

instance as a historical fact that the Court

3

has to deal with, they still have lower

4

guideline ranges under Section 3582.

5

And that's all that's required for

6

eligibility.

And so, for all the reasons that

7

several justices of the Court have said,

8

whether you -- no matter what you do, I think

9

the safest way to resolve these cases, this

10

narrow band of cases you're dealing with here

11

with cooperators whose -- whose guideline

12

ranges were below the mandatory minimum is to

13

send them back to the district judge and allow

14

the judge to exercise the informed expertise

15

that the Congress imagined and that Section

16

3582 in particular envisions to decide whether

17

these defendants should get a new sentence or

18

not, and how much that sentence -- new sentence

19

should be reduced.

20
21

If there are no further questions,
I'll submit the case.

22
