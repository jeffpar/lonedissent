ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW S. HELLMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. HELLMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

11

When Congress made it a felony to

12

obstruct the due administration of the tax

13

code, it was not creating an all-purpose tax

14

crime; it was borrowing from a statute that

15

prohibited the obstruction of a pending

16

proceeding.

17

This Court normally presumes that

18

borrowed language carries its meaning with it.

19

And that has to be the case here, for without

20

that limitation, obstruction would swallow up

21

the other crimes that Congress simultaneously

22

enacted and, in particular, it would obliterate

23

the careful line that Congress drew between

24

misdemeanors and felonies.

25

Indeed, the government's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
4
1

interpretation is so broad that it would chill

2

entirely legitimate conduct that Congress never

3

intended to penalize.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What -- what -­

5

what lawful conduct would the government's

6

reading put at risk?

7

MR. HELLMAN:

Certainly.

There's a

8

whole range because obstruction, on their

9

definition, is so broad.

For example, you

10

could imagine a situation -- I'll take an

11

everyday taxpayer, someone who pays their

12

gardener, say, in cash, which is one of the

13

predicate acts in this case as well.

14

cash isn't necessarily illegal under the tax

15

laws, but the test that the government would

16

have is, by paying someone in cash, you're -­

17

you're making it harder for the IRS to assess

18

perhaps your tax liability or perhaps the tax

19

liability of the person that you are paying.

20

And at that question -- at that point, the only

21

question that remains is mens rea, why did you

22

do it?

23

obtaining an unlawful benefit?

24

that benefit need not even be your own under

25

the government's reading; it could be the

Paying in

Did you do it for the purpose of
And even -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
5
1
2

benefit of the gardener.
Or to take another example, imagine a

3

taxpayer who says I'm going to keep every

4

document the law requires under the code.

I'll

5

keep every document but no documents more.

If

6

the IRS ever came back and looked at that

7

person's tax position, they might say your

8

failure to keep these documents that -- that

9

aren't otherwise required hindered us in our

10

ability to assess your taxes.

11

At that point, again, the only

12

question becomes the why, the mens rea.

13

with a felony prosecution on the line and with

14

so many acts, the actus reus being so broad,

15

anything that hinders the IRS's ability to

16

carry out a code, obstructs -­

17
18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And

My problem is that

I have -- a second question.

19

MR. HELLMAN:

Sure.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I have a lot of

21

hypotheticals under your definition of what

22

this section means that wouldn't be covered.

23

So how about if an individual knows that the

24

IRS is in the presence of -- press -- in the

25

process of assessing his taxes and he in some

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
6
1

way obstructs that process, or an agent -- the

2

agent in 2004 called the defendant and said:

3

And your client answered the way he

8

9

have to file.

I don't

And the agent closes the

10

investigation -- closes the file and says:

11

not going to investigate this.

12
13

Under your theory, that direct
obstruction would not be actionable?

14

MR. HELLMAN:

It would be several

15

other crimes.

16

sounds like tax evasion, if there's a

17

deficiency and an evasive act in connection

18

with it.

19

20

proceeding requirement.

21

I'm

As -- as you describe it, it

It could be a false statement to the

But Congress knows how to write a pending

If you think back to the statute at

22

issue in Arthur Andersen, Section 1512, another

23

obstruction statute that applies in cases of

24

corruption to proceedings, that 1512(f), which

25

Congress enacted as part of Sarbanes-Oxley,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

says the proceeding need not be pending or even

2

about to be instituted.

3

Now, this Court -­

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

minute, yes, it can do that sometimes.

6

MR. HELLMAN:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

11
12
13

It can do that.
It doesn't other

times.

9
10

Well, wait a

MR. HELLMAN:

It doesn't other times.

And -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So is this one of

those other times?
MR. HELLMAN:

Well, I think the -- the

14

right way to understand it is Congress is -­

15

the "need not be pending" language was a

16

product of a 1980s revision to the statute and

17

really started to apply to documents in

18

Sarbanes-Oxley.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do you think the

20

word "administration" -- "due administration of

21

this title," does any work in the

22

interpretation?

23

say that the example I gave is an actual

24

affirmative act by the agency.

25

agent is calling and doing his work under the

It seems to me that one could

It is -- the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
8
1

Act but that what you do outside of interacting

2

directly with the agency is more omission,

3

which is not the administration of the Act.

4

Could that line be drawn?

5

MR. HELLMAN:

I don't -- that's

6

certainly not the line the government is

7

offering, but -- but -­

8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's not the line

the government's offering -­

10

MR. HELLMAN:

Is offering.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- but yours is -­

12

your broadness is sweeping up a lot of conduct

13

that I think could be perceived as active

14

obstruction of the work of -- the direct work

15

of the agency.

16

mislead them.

17

An agent calls you and you

MR. HELLMAN:

Well, a couple

18

responses.

As I said, those are covered by

19

other crimes in the statute, false statements.

20

Could even be covered by the officers clause of

21

this statute.

22

this is, in some sense, and I think the point

23

of your question is, not paying your taxes,

24

failing to file a return, failure to make a

25

payment, we would concede is in some sense

But I think that the key for

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
9

obstruction of the administration of the code,

2

but that can't be what Congress had in mind for

3

this statute because we know what they thought

4

the penalty for those crimes should be.

5

should be a misdemeanor.

6

7

crime, but it's a misdemeanor punishable by one

8

year.

page of the code, they're calling this conduct

12

view, actually, it turns out that -- it turns

13

out to be felony obstruction.

14

provisions that were the product of an intense,

15

multi-year process of reforming the tax code,

16

where Congress specifically debated back and

17

forth between the House and the Senate about

18

whether some of these crimes should be

19

classified as misdemeanors or felonies.

20

And then, on the government's

And these are

And so I think when you're trying to

21

read a statute as a whole -- and here the need

22

to do that is at its apex because we're not

23

talking about different provisions that were

24

enacted over a series of decades.

25

Congress's concerted attempt to codify and

This was

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

calibrate the penalties that it wanted.

2

And then to find out that actually

3

everything turns out to be a felony because in

4

every -- any act that violates a tax law could

5

in some sense be meant -- understood to be

6

obstructing the administration of the code,

7

that's not a plausible way to read a statute.

18

I'm sorry.

In

I mean, is it the case that you find

MR. HELLMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

And I

19

-- and I think the tax amici and other amici

20

who have filed in this case speak to that.

21

I took a look -- and this is just my

22

own personal review of the cases -- in the -­

23

beginning in the -- really in the '90s and then

24

in the 2000s, you start to see 7212 obstruction

25

charges brought in -- there's hundreds of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
11

cases.

You can go online and just look for

2

where those charges have been brought, even in

3

reported cases.

4

And as we discuss in the brief, the

5

predicates are -- are now becoming ones in

6

which failure to file a return is becoming a

7

predicate, failure to pay taxes is becoming a

8

predicate.

-- every three weeks

20

or so or every week or -- and the gardener does

21

some gardening, burns some leaves, and you pay

22

him more than $600 over the year.

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. HELLMAN:

That's right.

And I

think another -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, Mr. Hellman, I

6

-- I mean, I share the -- your -- your concern

7

that if this statute is read in its broadest

8

possible literal sense, it has a really

9

staggering sweep, but I wonder if your

10

interpretation really solves the problem

11

because can't the same sorts of things happen

12

after a proceeding has commenced?

13

Let's say somebody is being audited

14

and eventually the person comes up with the

15

records that the auditor needs, but they're all

16

scrambled up, and it looks like -- and -- and

17

the person is -- is late in providing them and

18

misses meetings and just is very difficult.

19
20
21

You could get the same situation
there, couldn't you?
MR. HELLMAN:

I suppose you could, but

22

there's a difference as to why I think the

23

statute ought to tolerate prosecution in that

24

scenario, which is where there's been a formal

25

notice of audit and someone has been given

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

questions by the government and needs to

2

respond in a reasonable manner to them.

3

You can understand why Congress wanted

4

to make that a crime distinct from, maybe on

5

top of, other crimes that a person has

6

committed.

7

maintenance of records prior to the initiation

8

of that proceeding, then there are many other

9

crimes that do cover recordkeeping and, of

10
11

But if we're talking about the

course, your obligation to pay taxes.
But those are generally, with the

12

exception of tax evasion, generally not

13

felonies and they generally have a lower

14

sentence than the one here.

15

So I do take your point that there

16

could be the potential for abuse, even under

17

our interpretation, but I do think that it's

18

significantly narrowed just for the reasons

19

that I said.

20

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. -­
Mr. Hellman, there are

22

obvious reasons to search for a limiting

23

interpretation here.

24

MR. HELLMAN:

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.
I guess the question

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

is why your limiting interpretation?

2

obviously you talked about this in your brief.

3

But I just want to give you an opportunity now

4

to try to convince me, because right now I feel

5

as though it comes out of thin air.

6

have any grounding in the text of the statute.

7
8
9

And

It doesn't

And I guess I'm not seeing quite how
the precedent gets you there.
MR. HELLMAN:

So -­

Absolutely.

I think the

10

-- the key reasons why we would think that

11

Congress had 1503 in mind when it was talking

12

-- when it was enacting 7212 are the following:

13

You've got a statute, 1503, enacted just a few

14

years before, six years before.

15

just talk about obstruction of the due

16

administration of something.

17

It doesn't

It's got that two-part structure with

18

officers in the first half, administration in

19

the second.

20

impede or intimidate the officer, or impede or

21

obstruct the proceeding.

22

It's got those same verbs, to

And you also have the same means by

23

which you're doing it.

So you put that all

24

together and, on top of that, the fact that

25

there's nothing unusual about obstruction

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

proceed -- obstruction statutes having

2

proceedings as their focus.

3

There are several obstruction statutes

4

after 1503 in the code that all talk about

5

obstruction of proceedings.

6

So -- so, when you talk about

7

obstruction of the due administration, it's

8

sort of a natural marriage of that concept to

9

proceedings.

10

Now, there's no legislative history

11

that speaks to this one way or the other.

12

certainly concede that.

think that word choice can be explained by -­

the problem of, again, what would -- the

5

government's alternative interpretation puts a

6

code that would stretch across this, you know,

7

this entire table, any violation of it, which

8

is potentially a felony.

If I would, I wanted to go back to one

10

other way in which -- and this is not just an

11

omissions point, this is an affirmative acts

12

point -- 7205 in the tax code.

13

If anybody's ever been an employee in

14

this country, when you start your job, you fill

15

out the W-4 form where you say how many

16

dependents you have, which controls how much

17

withholding your employer will take out of your

18

-- your paycheck.

19

I, too, know many people who don't put

down the true number of dependents that they

16

18

direction.

19

We haven't made a constitutional

20

argument in this case that it would be

21

unlawful, unconstitutional for Congress to

22

write a statute, the statute that the

23

government says they wrote here.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. HELLMAN:

We'll save that for the

2

next case.

3

argued in this case is that, as the Court

4

explained in Aguilar, before this Court will

5

assume that Congress meant to felonize every

6

immoral act under the sun, we're going to want

7

them to say that a little bit more clearly than

8

they -- than they did in the statute.

9

But what we have most definitely

JUSTICE BREYER:

But how did they in

10

Aguilar?

I mean, I took -- I read the language

11

in Aguilar and I thought it was very helpful to

12

your case.

The statute's identical -­

13

MR. HELLMAN:

Yes.

-- virtually, except

15

administration of justice instead of

16

administration of this title.

17

MR. HELLMAN:

Correct.

18

19

limited how they interpreted it.

they said something about a nexus -­

MR. HELLMAN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- what's your

understanding of that?
MR. HELLMAN:

So, as I read Aguilar,

4

it's a nexus to a pending proceeding.

5

that case, the defendant lied, that was

6

conceded to an FBI agent, but it wasn't clear

7

that those statements were ever going to get

8

into court into a grand jury proceeding.

9

might or might not in the words of the Court.

10

And what the court -­

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

So, in

They

So your argument is

12

nexus to a pending proceeding, interpreted with

13

the same language except it says administration

14

of justice should lead us to say nexus to a

15

pending proceeding in a statute that's

16

identical, but the words are administration of

17

this title.

18

MR. HELLMAN:

Yes.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. HELLMAN:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. HELLMAN:

Is that the argument?

That is.
All right.

And, again, to respond

23

to Justice Gorsuch's question, the Court has

24

proceeded carefully with lenity in mind when it

25

-- when it's looked at a statute that the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
22
1

government has said covers everything that one

2

might want to punish, but doesn't clearly say

3

that that is what we intend to punish, and both

4

considerations of fair notice and, as the Court

5

put it, deference to the prerogatives of

6

Congress suggests that a more narrow

7

interpretation is called for.

8
9
10

JUSTICE KAGAN:
lenity means?

Well, is that what

This -- for sure this is a broad

statute.

11

MR. HELLMAN:

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.
It doesn't seem very

13

ambiguous.

14

looking for a grievous ambiguity, sort of like

15

the last case where it's like, I don't know,

16

you could read it this way, you could read it

17

that way.

18

You know, lenity, usually we're

What do we do?
But that's not this statute.

This

19

statute, taken on its face, is just ungodly

20

broad.

21

MR. HELLMAN:

I understand the Court's

22

lenity doctrine to say that once you apply the

23

normal tools of statutory interpretation, if

24

you're really left with good arguments on both

25

sides, there's real ambiguity, important

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
23
1
2
3
4

ambiguity.
In a criminal case, you go with the
less harsh interpretation.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And I do -­
So -- so, for

5

example, if we are left with some ambiguity as

6

to your Aguilar analogy, that's when you would

7

suggest perhaps lenity might be a tiebreaker?

8
9

MR. HELLMAN:

Yes -- yes, I do.

-- and with respect to Justice Kagan's

10

question, I think that these words read in

11

isolation do suggest breadth.

12

in isolation isn't the -- the only step

13

obviously of statutory interpretation.

14

And

But reading them

We have to look at it in context.

And

15

this is an incredibly strong case where context

16

ought to matter, where you have Congress

17

intentionally trying to bring together in one

18

place, I believe is the phrase they used, all

19

of the disparate tax crimes and recalibrate

20

them as they saw fit.

21

So, again, the statute, read in

22

isolation, I certainly take the point that it

23

-- it looks broad and strong and "ungodly

24

broad," to use your phrase, but that isn't the

25

end of the statutory analysis.

And once you do

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
24
1

all of the steps -- you look to where the

2

language comes from, you look to what it might

3

mean in context with other provisions right

4

next door to it -- at that point, we suggest -­

5

we think we have the better of the argument,

6

but at a minimum, at a bare minimum, there are

7

competing interpretations that -- where the

8

rule of lenity might apply.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There -- there is

10

something to be done about the context that

11

this was drafted in.

12

half of this statute -­

As I look at the first

13

MR. HELLMAN:

Yes.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- "Whoever

15

corruptly or by force or threats of force

16

(including any threatening letter or

17

communication) endeavors to intimidate or

18

impede any officer or employee of the U.S.

19

acting in an official capacity" -­

20

MR. HELLMAN:

Yes.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- "... or in any

22

way corruptly or by force or threat of force,

(including any threatening letter or

24

communication) obstructs or impedes, or

25

endeavors to obstruct or impede, the due

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

All of that

2

seems to be geared towards some affirmative act

3

aimed at an agent or the agency.

4

That's where I got my earlier -­

5

MR. HELLMAN:

6

7

Yes.
-- differentiation

between -­

8

MR. HELLMAN:

MR. HELLMAN:

of responses.

20

-- behavior that

And I have a couple

I don't think the omission limitation

21

will get -- will make sense of the tax criminal

22

code for a couple of reasons.

23

several misdemeanor offenses under the code

affirmative act offenses.

One, there are

And Congress showed

Heritage Reporting Corporation

a lot of thought:

2

connection with your taxes -- that's an

3

affirmative act -- is a misdemeanor unless

4

you -- unless you make that statement under the

5

penalty of perjury.

6

between Section 7207 and Section 7206,

7

subsection (1).

8
9

Making a false statement in

That is the difference

That distinction between bad kinds of
false statements, affirmative acts, is

10

obviated, obliterated, by an interpretation of

11

obstruction that says, when you make a false

12

statement to the government, it has the effect

13

of hindering, even if you didn't make it under

14

the penalty of perjury.

15

not in that connection.

You might have made it

16

So I don't think that an

17

omissions-based approach makes -- you know,

18

gets -­

19

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, does it get us

20

part of the way there, though?

Because the

21

officer clause, as Justice Sotomayor suggests,

22

you have to actually hinder something the

23

officer is doing.

24

or thought be thought to apply in the

25

administration as well, that the IRS has to be

And could that same spirit

Your preceding thought is a

merely -- I think the IRS speaks of the

4

pervasive, continuous, brooding omnipresence of

5

--

6

MR. HELLMAN:

Yes.

7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Right.
-- of tax

8

liabilities, that there's an implication from

9

the officers clause that there's something more

10

going on.

11

helpful.

12

Am I -- maybe that's not entirely

MR. HELLMAN:

Well, what I would say

13

is if -- if the thought is by limiting

14

obstruction to any affirmative act that hinders

15

the IRS in any way, you have not brought the

16

statute -­

17

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

No, no, no.

No, no,

18

limiting it to some affirmative act going on by

19

the agency, I think, is what Justice Sotomayor

20

was suggesting, that the agency has to be doing

21

something other than merely passively receiving

22

taxes.

23

MR. HELLMAN:

Well, and, of course,

24

all of the conduct or omissions in this case

25

are not in that context.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

MR. HELLMAN:

3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

4

Correct.

So -­
It's -- it's a

friendly amendment.

5

(Laughter.)

6

MR. HELLMAN:

Then that's not the rule

7

we have adopted or endorsed to the Court, but

8

-- and, again, you would have some other -­

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

getting to what you have -­

11

MR. HELLMAN:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I have difficulty

Right.
-- because you

13

haven't, as Justice Kagan pointed out, given us

14

anything in the language to anchor this in.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

At

Right.
-- Justice -- it

18

appears Justice Gorsuch and I are trying to

19

look at the language.

20

MR. HELLMAN:

So what I would say in

21

response to that is we would accept -- because

22

there is no act in question here that falls

23

within that rule.

24

think that -- you know, would we accede to

25

that, yes, we would.

So, if you're asking me do I

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

A win is a win is

a win.

4

MR. HELLMAN:

A win is a win, for

5

certain, but I just want to be -- be certain

6

that the Court fully appreciates that the line

7

between when the IRS is doing something and not

8

doing something at times can be a little bit

9

blurry.

And so, you know, I'd want to think

10

about your proposal, but in any case, the -­

11

the key part is unless there's a proceeding -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You just helped

the government a lot with that statement.

14

MR. HELLMAN:

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. HELLMAN:

I hope I did not.

The -- our submission to

17

this Court is that the government's

18

interpretation in this case cannot be correct.

19

We have offered language that comes directly

20

from a predecessor statute dealing with

21

proceedings, but I understand the Court's point

22

that you might define proceedings a little more

23

broadly than we do -­

I'm not even arguing

with you.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. HELLMAN:

Yeah.

2

that the officers clause might be a source of

some aid to you.

MR. HELLMAN:

6

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

7

9
10

Agreed.
That's all I'm

doing.
MR. HELLMAN:

Absolutely agreed.

Absolutely agreed.
Now, the other part I wanted to make

11

sure I -- I said before I sat down was the

12

government's interpretation in this case,

13

although they push it now, is not one that they

14

had invoked for nearly 30 years after the

15

statute was enacted.

16

Although they claim it's -- there is

17

no ambiguity, there is no need for lenity, this

18

is a -- an interpretation that really came into

19

fruition in the '90s, and with increasing

20

frequency in -- in many, many cases, this is

21

now being charged.

22

And if the Court has no further

23

questions, I will reserve the rest of my time

24

for rebuttal.

I'd like at the very outset to address

8

several of the things that my friend just said.

He -- he suggested that entirely lawful conduct

10

would come within this statute.

that is incorrect.

MR. PARKER:

Okay.

I think it -- it bears

explanation as to why.

I mean, first, I think

that the threshold is actually $2,000.

that the -­

I'm waiting for a

said 600.

MR. PARKER:

But -- well, but that's

14

if you're a business employing an independent

15

contractor, so an -- an individual.

16

I don't want to -- I don't think that that

17

matters.

18

--

19

But -- but

The -- the point, though, is if you

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

How -- how is

20

somebody supposed to know when they're going to

21

be in trouble here?

22

paying cash -­

Because it seems like

23

a problem.

Uh-huh.
-- can sometimes be

That was part of the indictment and

records, failure to keep records -­

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

5

Or keeping

Right.
-- that you didn't

-- that aren't lawfully obliged to be kept.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

You realize everybody

7

in this audience now knows about the 1099 form,

8

right?

9

(Laughter.)

10

MR. PARKER:

Well, they -- they may be

11

kept out of trouble as a result.

12

think that the point -- there are a couple of

13

points that I think are important to make.

14

But I -- I

The first is the mens rea requirement

15

of this statute, as in all obstruction

16

statutes, is critical, and it is very exacting.

17

So -­

18

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

The government made

19

some similar arguments in the honest services

20

case, that everything can be cured by a mens

21

rea requirement.

22

actus reus.

23

reus when we get there.

24

law of honest services.

25

We don't need to worry about

We'll tell you about the actus
We'll create a common

And here it seems to me that's what

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

the government's parallel -- parallel argument,

2

that we're not going to tell you what

3

qualifies.

4

We'll find out later.

And sometimes it's going to be simply

5

paying cash.

6

keeping records.

7

we going to wind up in the same place, that you

8

drive this thing to such enormous breadth in

9

its interpretation that you're -- you're

10

Sometimes it's not going to be
And -- and I just wonder are

inviting a vagueness challenge at the back end?

11

MR. PARKER:

I -- I disagree with

12

that, Justice Gorsuch, and I'd like to just

13

take a moment to explain why.

14

So there are a number of limiting

15

features of this statute that provide

16

protection against precisely what you are

17

explaining.

18

of them.

19

And I think there are really three

The first is there has to be a natural

20

tendency to obstruct.

21

factual nexus that Aguilar says is baked into

22

the term "endeavor."

23
24
25

This is the objective

There's at least that.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And paying cash is

enough, though, under the government -­
MR. PARKER:

No, not necessarily.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:
case.

3
4

MR. PARKER:

Actually, no.

I don't

think that that -­

5
6

Well, it is in this

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

That's -- that's in

the jury instructions.

7

MR. PARKER:

The -- the -- paying cash

8

was one of the means of the obstructive

9

endeavor.

10

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

11

MR. PARKER:

Right.

It was a -- a factual way

12

that the individual was engaging in obstructive

13

conduct.

14

on the overall facts of this case there was a

15

natural tendency of that act to obstruct.

16

But you then have to determine that

You also have to show that the

17

individual intended, specifically intended to

18

obstruct the -- the administration of the code.

19

And then third -­

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

21
22

But before you go on,

what do you do with the term "impede"?
MR. PARKER:

Well, I -- I think that

23

the term "impede" is largely coextensive with

24

the term "obstruct."

25

In fact -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I don't know

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
37
1

whether it is.

The -- the dictionary

2

definition of "impede" is:

3

slow the progress of.

Interfere with or

4

So anything that makes the work of the

5

IRS more difficult impedes the work of the IRS.

6

MR. PARKER:

I -- I -- well, I would

7

disagree with the statement that anything that

8

makes the work of the IRS more difficult.

9

I think this goes to what I was just about to

10
11
12
13

And

say.
JUSTICE ALITO:
disagree with that?

Why?

Why?

Why do you

On what basis?

MR. PARKER:

So -- so you have -- you

14

have to have the natural tendency to obstruct.

15

You then have to have proof.

16
17
18

JUSTICE ALITO:

You have the mens rea.

What do you have besides the mens rea?
MR. PARKER:

Well, you -- you then

19

have to be acting corruptly, which means that

20

you have to have the specific intent to obtain

21

an unlawful advantage.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's the mens rea.

What do you have besides the mens rea?
MR. PARKER:

Let's -- so let's say

that you are engaged in lawful conduct, you're

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
38
1

paying people in cash, or you have structured

2

your corporate form in a way that may make it

3

more complicated for the IRS to figure out what

4

your income and expenses are.

5

Those things do not have a natural

6

tendency to obstruct in and of themselves

7

because there is nothing that says that the

8

administration of the code has to be made

9

maximally easy.

10

The only reason that those would end

11

up having a -- an obstructive effect is if you

12

pair them with efforts to mislead or deceive

13

the IRS into believing that the situation is

14

not as it appears for an unlawful advantage.

15

So in the -­

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, where does this

17

come from in the language of the statute?

18

mean, this -- that's what troubles me about

19

this.

20

in ordinary language, slow the progress of, you

21

don't even have to impede.

22

you endeavor to impede.

23

I

If I read "impede" to mean what it means

It's enough that

The only limiting thing I see here is

24

"corruptly."

And, you know, the old, you know,

25

the old saying, it's lawful for taxpayers to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
39
1

avoid taxes but not to evade taxes.

2

line is -- the line can be very -- can be very

3

thin.

4

MR. PARKER:

So the

I'm not sure actually

5

that it is all that thin.

And I think that the

6

-- what -- what is important to remember here

7

is that there has to be an effort to actually

8

convert that completely lawful conduct into

9

something that has the natural tendency to

10

obstruct or impede the IRS in an unlawful

11

manner to obtain an unlawful benefit.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, let me just give

13

you a variation of the hypothetical that's

14

already been given.

15

So somebody -- somebody offers to

16

clean my gutters, and he says $100 cash, $125

17

if you pay me by check.

18

this?

19

MR. PARKER:

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

21

MR. PARKER:

22
23

Is that a violation of

No, not at all.
Why -- why not?

Well, because there -­

there is no -­

What if I -- what if I

-- you know, I understand why he's going to

25

give me the discount by paying by cash, because

Heritage Reporting Corporation

40
1

he doesn't want to report it.

2

MR. PARKER:

Well, again, I think that

3

you would then have to pair that with other

4

efforts to deceive the IRS, as you did here.

5

mean, Mr. Marinello -­

6
7
8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why?

Why isn't that

sufficient in itself?
MR. PARKER:

Because there's no

natural tendency of the mere fact that you give

10

him $100 in cash to obstruct anything.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What

I know he's not

going to report, and he doesn't report.
MR. PARKER:

Well, I think that if -­

17

if you actually have the -- the subjective

18

specific intent that you are giving him this

19

money with the intent that he is not going to

20

report it to the IRS, and you are engaged in a

21

common endeavor to -- to obstruct the IRS's

22

ability to duly administer the code, I think -­

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But doesn't everybody

24

know -- doesn't everybody know when they're

25

given an offer like this, you know, I'd rather

Heritage Reporting Corporation

have cash than a check, doesn't everybody know

2

why people would rather have cash than a check?

3

MR. PARKER:

Well, that may be true,

4

but, again, I -- this is I think precisely why

5

these sorts of things, A, are -- are not

6

charged under this statute but, B, I think

7

would be incredibly difficult to charge under

8

this statute.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why?

Why?

I mean,

10

that's -- you have used several times the words

11

"specific intent."

12

intent to me in the law means knowledge that

13

the particular action is unlawful.

So is it the -- specific

14

MR. PARKER:

Uh-huh.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

So are you saying the

16

government's position is we cannot under this

17

statute prosecute any person for anything he

18

does unless that person knows that what he is

19

doing, such as giving money to a person in

20

cash, will be used to provide a benefit to that

21

person that is unlawful, he knows that doing

22

this, what he is doing, is unlawful, and unless

23

he knows that, the statute does not permit

24

prosecution?

25

MR. PARKER:

I -- I think that that is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
42

accurate.

2

I mean, you -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

No, don't think it's

3

accurate.

I want to know if the government of

4

the United States is saying this statute does

5

not permit us to prosecute any person, unless

6

that person knows that the action he is taking

7

-- I'm repeating myself -- such as giving the

8

money in cash, breaks the federal law, and he

9

also knows that what he is doing in giving that

10

money breaks the federal law?

11

MR. PARKER:

Well, he has -­
If he does not know

position of the United States, on that question

of interpretation, it is an interpretation of

the word "corruptly."

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

another question about this statute?

12

charge is that it would make any tax crime a

obstruction charge onto any tax crime in the

15

code and then you just get an additional

penalty.

17

Is that so?

19

also qualify as obstruction?
MR. PARKER:

The

Let's say -- well, let's

Wouldn't those

Tax evasion may because

21

there you are willfully attempting to obtain -­

22

to evade a tax deficiency, although the -- the

23

-- if you can prove tax evasion, there's little

24

reason to prove obstruction.

25

However, all of the other ones, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
44

answer is no.

2

Section 7212, they are different than the

3

elements that you will find in any other

4

criminal provision in the -- in the Internal

5

Revenue Code.

6

If you look at the elements of

They require corruption.

They require

7

an intent to obstruct.

8

require willful actions or willful failures to

9

act that may -­

10
11
12

Other provisions

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Is that the only

difference; it's just the mens rea difference?
MR. PARKER:

Well, I think that's -­

13

yes, I mean, you also must have a natural

14

tendency to obstruct.

15

failing to report your income, withholding that

16

information that you are lawfully required to

17

provide I think has that natural tendency.

18

And, for example,

But if you look at these other

19

provisions, take, for example, failure to file

20

a tax return, there are going to be individuals

21

-- and, in fact, I would wager to say that

22

there are probably a large number of

23

individuals -- who do not file their tax

24

returns for reasons that have nothing to do

25

with a specific intent to obtain an unlawful

Heritage Reporting Corporation

advantage.

They may say -­

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Like what?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In that circumstance,

10

there's no intent to obtain that unlawful

11

advantage because you don't know whether you're

12

going to be advantaged or not.

13

I think the same thing could be said

14

of, you know, failure to keep records.

16

just sitting around and it makes you upset to

17

have so many records in your house.

remarkable -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Heritage Reporting Corporation

guess, which is, I think you used the word

2

"cantankerous" in your brief, is that right,

3

that some people are just cantankerous, and

4

they're just not going to file.

5

MR. PARKER:

Yes.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Perhaps that's

7

a fairly small number of people compared to the

8

situation where it is not terribly difficult

9

for an assistant U.S. attorney to prove that

10

something was done corruptly as opposed to

11

willfully.

12

MR. PARKER:

Well, I -­

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's kind of

14

like the discussion we were having, that it is

15

not hard to prove that paying in cash rather

16

than a check when you get a discount was for a

17

purpose to give a -- a lawful advantage.

Suppose we were to

conclude that 80 percent of criminal tax

misdemeanor violations could be accompanied by

the felony charges contained within this

statute.

Would that be cause for our Court to
be concerned?

MR. PARKER:

it would necessarily be cause for concern.

think that would be surprising.

provision.

MR. PARKER:

that's a fair point, Mr. Chief Justice, but I

think that it does not motivate the adoption of

proposing.

Remember, Petitioner's -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

On -- on that -- on

that score, the verbs "obstruct" and "impede,"

I have to -- have to -- because it is specific

MR. PARKER:

routine and predictable schedule.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

to obstruct the administration of the code.

14

And the only point that we're making is that

15

administration, unlike in the case of the due

16

administration of justice, which involves

17

discrete proceedings that many Americans will

18

go their entire lives without having a

19

connection to, the due administration of the

20

Internal Revenue Code occurs on a routine and

21

predictable schedule that people know is coming

22

and can reasonably foresee.

JUSTICE BREYER:

JUSTICE BREYER:

But you are -­

-- if you want, I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

want this answer.

2

your answer, but I want you to augment it.

3

I don't want to interrupt

And you started to do that when you

4

started to talk about just what you were

5

talking about.

6

three principles:

7

Look, if I put it differently,

One, the Chief Justice, I think,

8

enunciated, and I -- it sounds comical if I'm

9

going to say it, but -- but it's very

10

important; it is not an appropriate way of

11

interpreting a statute.

12

Look, perfect criminal statute, it is

13

a crime to do wrong in the opinion of the

14

attorney general.

15

it properly.

16

Even if you do interpret it properly,

17

no.

18

think, is no.

19

Don't worry, we'll interpret

The answer under the Constitution, I

The second principle is right here in

20

Aguilar, both of them, the second and third.

21

"We have traditionally exercised restraint in

22

assessing the reach of a federal criminal

23

statute, both out of deference to the

24

prerogative of Congress and out of concern that

25

a fair warning should be given to the world in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
53
1

language that the common world will understand

2

of what the law will do, if a certain line is

3

passed."

4

From those principles, they conclude

5

that a statute identically worded to this one

6

but for the word justice instead of title

7

requires a nexus be shown to a specific grand

8

jury or jury proceeding, a -- a court

9

proceeding, even though, of course, you can

10

read the word justice to include the

11

investigators and many other things.

12

All right.

They're saying, in effect,

13

you take those same principles, that same

14

limiting restriction, and do the same analogous

15

thing here.

16

Now, why not?

17

MR. PARKER:

I think there are a

18

number of reasons not to do that.

First of

19

all, I think that the -- as I just explained,

20

the due administration of justice has always

21

been understood to be something that occurs in

22

discrete proceedings, unlike the administration

23

of the Internal Revenue Code; but I think that

24

that is confirmed by the history of Section

25

1503.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
54
1

The predecessor statute to Section

2

1503 specifically said that it only applied to

3

the obstruction of officers or witnesses in any

4

court of the United States or the due

5

administration of justice therein.

6

Now, when Congress recodified that

7

provision in 1948, it modified the wording, but

8

as this Court has repeatedly explained, that

9

1948 recodification was not intended to have

10

any substantive effect on any of the provisions

11

in the code.

12

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But Congress

13

legislates against the backdrop of what's out

14

there.

15

interpretation of those words requiring a nexus

16

to an active proceeding, something more than -­

17

something more definite than something that's

18

continuous, ubiquitous and universal.

And what -- what was out there was our

19

MR. PARKER:

Well -­

20

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And -- and the

21

Congress that passed this statute had that

22

interpretation in its back pocket at the time;

23

right?

24
25

MR. PARKER:

Well, I -- but I would

disagree with that because in none of this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
55
1

Court's cases, in Pettibone, in Aguilar, Arthur

2

Andersen, any of them did this Court ever

3

suggest that it is the phrase "due

4

administration," not the phrase "due

5

administration of justice," that carries that

6

connotation.

7

And I would also note that if that is,

8

in fact, what Congress intended, it is very

9

strange because Congress had just a few years

10

earlier enacted the statute that is now Section

11

1505, cited in our brief.

12

And that statute was specifically

13

enacted to do exactly what -- what you're

14

suggesting, Justice Gorsuch.

15

extend the provisions of Section 1503 to

16

pending proceedings before agencies of the

17

United States.

18

It was enacted to

And that is what it says.

If the Petitioner's interpretation

19

were correct, then I think that there's really

20

no reason for Congress to have enacted that,

21

and it would also be awfully strange for

22

Congress not to have borrowed that language.

23

But I would also note that there are a

24

number of -- as I -- getting back to the point

25

I was making previously, there is no reason to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
56
1

adopt his particular limiting construction,

2

which, frankly, I think has no basis in the

3

text, and -­

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

MS. PARKER:

6

Mr. -- Mr. Parker -­

-- does not solve these

problems.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Can -- can I go back

8

to the question of -- of -- of the Department's

9

prosecution policy?

10

And, you know I -- could you tell me,

11

number 1, what the current state of the

12

Department's guidance is as to whether

13

prosecutors are -- are told to prosecute to the

14

maximum extent allowed by law; and, number 2,

15

whether that would mean in this case that here

16

I am a prosecutor and I think that some action

17

falls within 7212, that I would be precluded

18

from proceeding instead under 7203 or 7205 or

19

7207.

20

MR. PARKER:

My understanding is it is

21

certainly the Department's position as a

22

general matter that prosecutors should be

23

charging the most serious offense that is

24

readily provable on those facts.

25

I -- I -- I couldn't say whether in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
57
1

any given case that would mean that

2

Section 7212 would have to be charged because,

3

as I said before, the facts of each case are

4

going to be different and they're going to make

5

the ability to prove Section 7212 more or less

6

possible.

7

And there are going to be a number of

8

cases where I think 7212 isn't even possible

9

to -- even to allege.

10

And so I -- I think that

-- I'm not sure that it's -­

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes, but I guess what

12

I was saying is that if a prosecutor could

13

proceed under 7212, that the prosecutor is

14

being instructed that she must proceed under

15

that section.

16

MR. PARKER:

If -- if -- if the facts

17

of that case render a 7212 charge readily

18

provable, then, yes, I think that prosecutors

19

would do that, but I -- I also think that that

20

is not borne out by -- a concern that that is

21

going to lead to just these sorts of charges

22

becoming common and ubiquitous doesn't

23

necessarily translate because, as I said, our

24

understanding is that it's only about 4 percent

25

of cases.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
58
1
2

And that includes the most recent data
from this -- from this year.

3

And so -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, you

4

used the phrase "readily provable."

5

want to as a question of fact, is that -- is

6

that the term that's used or is that your

7

summary of what you understand?

8
9

MR. PARKER:

I just

I -- I don't exactly

remember the term that is used, but certainly

10

the government has to satisfy itself that it

11

can prove beyond a reasonable doubt in that

12

case that that crime has occurred.

13
14

I -- I also, though, want to get back
--

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, before you move

16

off that point, why should we be comforted by

17

the fact that prosecutorial discretion can be

18

used in applying a statute, if this is a

19

statute, with a really broad reach so that it

20

reaches a lot of rather trivial conduct?

21

Doesn't that make the situation worse rather

22

than better?

23

decide where they want to use this.

24
25

So then the prosecutors can

MR. PARKER:
it does.

I -- I don't think that

I mean, I think that the government

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
59
1

has the -- the responsibility to enforce

2

Congress's statutes.

3

And if Congress has provided that this

4

particular conduct is criminal, then I think

5

that that is appropriate.

6

there is anything that is particularly

7

standardless or vague or -- or otherwise

8

uncertain about this particular statute.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I don't think that

May I ask you, this

10

was, I think, brought up by the opposing side.

11

It is about 7212(b).

12

So the crime is rescuing seized

13

property.

Rescuing seized property carries a

14

two-year penalty.

15

to that 7212(a), obstruction of the

16

administration of the IRS -- IRC, so then -­

17

which is a three-year maximum?

18

MR. PARKER:

Could the government tack on

I -- I suppose that if

19

the government could prove that the person did

20

so with corrupt intent, and I think that that's

21

the main difference, obviously, between those

22

two provisions, in addition to the different

23

statutory penalties, if we could prove that,

24

then I think that would be available.

25

I'm not sure why the government would

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
60
1

want to tack one on to the other.

2

would all end up being charged as obstruction

3

anyway, and so I'm not sure why that would make

4

sense, but I -- I think it's possible.

5

There are -- there are -­

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I mean, this

Well, it would -­

7

if -- if it is the highest penalty, it's three

8

years under 7212(a) and only two years under

9

7212(b).

10

MR. PARKER:

Uh-huh.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, with a maximum

12

charging, why wouldn't the -­

13

MR. PARKER:

Well, because I think we

14

would simply proceed under Section 7212(a),

15

because that is the -- carries the higher

16

potential penalty.

17

I -- I would like to, in -- in the

18

time I have remaining, just be sure to make two

19

points.

20

The first is the Petitioner's proposed

21

limiting construction, as we've said, it

22

doesn't come -- it doesn't have a basis in the

23

text, but that doesn't mean that there aren't

24

other potential limiting constructions that

25

this Court could adopt, either in this case or

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
61
1

in another appropriate case.

2

I think, Justice Sotomayor, you

3

alluded to the possibility of excluding pure

4

omissions from -- from the scope of the statute

5

to try to differentiate between the misdemeanor

6

provisions and this one.

7

The Court actually engaged in a very

8

similar analysis in Spies.

That was the tax

9

evasion case where it determined that

10

omissions, pure omissions at least, would not

11

qualify.

12

And I think that that may be an

13

appropriate limiting construction here.

14

has suggested that.

15

Petitioner hasn't is because it wouldn't really

16

help him.

17

No one

And I think the reason

The only two means of the endeavor in

18

this case that were charged as failures to act,

19

if you look at the evidence, it was clear that

20

he was engaged in clear affirmative actions of

21

destroying his records and other things.

22

that's one point I'd like to make.

23

So

And the second is one of the main

24

problems here is that obstruction will -­

25

obstruction at the front end will often prevent

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
62
1

the government from being able to charge

2

appropriate offenses on the back end.

3

case demonstrates that perfectly.

4

And this

The government would have brought a

5

tax evasion charge in this case but for the

6

fact that Mr. Marinello so destroyed his

7

records that it was unable to prove beyond a

8

reasonable doubt that there was an actual tax

9

deficiency.

10

And so what I think Petitioner's

11

proposed construction would do is it would

12

effectively allow individuals to evade their

13

taxes and then obstruct their way down to a

14

misdemeanor charge, or if they are particularly

15

good at it, maybe obstruct their way out of

16

criminal penalties at all.

17

And the government could do nothing

18

about it, unless the individual actually

19

happened to be obstructing a pending audit or

20

investigation.

21

Audits and investigations are types of

22

administration, but the Internal Revenue Code

23

contains an entire subtitle called "Procedure

24

and Administration" that lists in sequential

25

chapters all of the different types of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1

administration that occur.

2

That includes the gathering of

3

information that taxpayers must self-report.

4

It includes the calculation and assessment of

5

taxes, the collection of taxes.

6

It would be very strange, I think, for

7

Congress to have specified that with such -­

8

with such clarity and then to have intended by

9

referencing the due administration of this

10

title to cut out all of that administrative

11

functions and only focus on audits and

12

investigations.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You gave the

14

example of the omission that Justice Sotomayor

15

brought up.

16

potentially huge scope of this provision?

17

What else could limit the

MR. PARKER:

Well, I think that -- I

18

mean, I -- I don't mean to repeat myself, but I

19

do think, Justice Ginsburg, that a rigorous

20

enforcement of the mens rea requirement does

21

that.

22

And this Court has repeatedly said

23

that in the obstruction context, rigorous

24

enforcement of mens rea requirements is what

25

separates individuals who do not have or have

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64
1

not committed culpable conduct from those who

2

do.

3

And I don't think that this

4

obstruction provision -- may I conclude?

5

don't think this obstruction provision should

6

be treated any differently.

7

Thank you.

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

Mr. Hellman, four minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW S. HELLMAN

12

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

13
14

Thank you,

counsel.

10
11

I

MR. HELLMAN:
Justice.

15

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Just a few quick points.
I want to begin with the misdemeanors,

16

the willful misdemeanors in the code.

17

I heard my friend on the other side suggest

18

that it could very well be that a highly

19

substantial number of those misdemeanors would

20

qualify as obstruction, which is in itself a

21

problem.

22

I think

And, again, it requires this Court to

23

think that the crimes that the Congress made

24

the centerpiece of the code, these willful

25

offenses, really are only meant for the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
65
1

idiosyncratic case in which somebody

2

intentionally violates the law but not for any

3

particular benefit.

4

In the context of willful tax

5

violations, I think in the substantial majority

6

of cases, if not all, you're going to have a

7

prosecutor who can say this was done for a

8

reason, some unlawful benefit, which need not

9

even be financial.

10

Second, as to the safeguards that the

11

mens rea requirement offers, in a world in

12

which not consulting fully with an accountant,

13

paying in cash, not keeping all records, can

14

become obstruction, if they're done for the

15

wrong reason, then you really are leaving it up

16

to the prosecutor, who is required under

17

current charging rules to charge as

18

aggressively as possible, to decide what was in

19

the defendant's mind.

20

Not every case goes to trial.

Very

21

few cases go to trial.

22

conviction in the balance, you're going to find

23

that this gives enormous leverage, even more so

24

than they currently have, to prosecutors.

25

With a felony

Third, there's a suggestion here that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
66
1

the government needs this broad interpretation;

2

otherwise, wrongdoing will go unpunished.

3

They can't point to a single case

4

since 1954 where that was the case.

5

certainly not the case here, where the

6

government told the jury repeatedly that Mr.

7

Marinello had substantial gross income and took

8

substantial personal income from that.

9

Exhibits 21 and 22 below and pages 516 to 518

10
11

It is

make that point very clearly.
Fourth, the omissions theory as an

12

alternative way of limiting this.

13

doesn't make sense of the statutes that are

14

misdemeanors, like forcible rescue, like

15

willful false statements, that are affirmative

16

acts but less punishment than the -- than the

17

7212 obstruction charge.

18

Again, that

The last thing I want to say is we

19

believe that based on the heritage of this

20

language and the fact that obstruction statutes

21

typically are focused on proceedings, that is

22

the interpretation we've offered to the Court.

23

But as Justice Gorsuch and Justice

24

Sotomayor pointed out, there are other ways of

25

reading the officers clause in conjunction with

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
67
1

the administration clause to come up with a

2

more limited standard that does not cover any

3

of the context -- conduct in this case, act or

4

omission.

5
6

So, for those reasons, we would ask
the Court to reverse.

7
8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What do you derive from the officer clause?

9

MR. HELLMAN:

10
11

So, what is it?

I -- I'm sorry?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What -- what is the

limit that you are now proposing?

12

MR. HELLMAN:

The limit that I am

13

understanding Justice Sotomayor and Justice

14

Gorsuch to be suggesting is, if you are -- if

15

your obstructive act or omission is in the

16

context with some interaction with the IRS,

17

not, say, failing to talk to an accountant on

18

your own time, not paying someone in cash in

19

your own home, but in some interaction with the

20

IRS, that could be a limitation; that would

21

limit it.

22

I think -­

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

An -- an

24

interaction, although no audit, no proceeding

25

is yet under way?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
68
1

MR. HELLMAN:

Yes, that -- yes, that

2

is the rule.

Now, I think that if in practice,

3

if you applied that, it would start to look an

4

awful lot like a proceeding requirement, maybe

5

a little bit broader around the edges, maybe a

6

little bit more flexibility, but it would be in

7

-- in substance kin to it.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And you're suggest -­
And you think it's

10

preferable given its heritage and for other

11

reasons?

12

MR. HELLMAN:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

If -- if so, I think

14

you're suggesting work with the word in the

15

statute, "administration."

16

MR. HELLMAN:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's the word?

Yes.
All right.

So, if I

18

start working with that word, do you have on

19

the top of your head two or three cases or

20

something I might read?

21
22

MR. HELLMAN:
look at -­

23
24
25

Well, I think if you

JUSTICE BREYER:

Aguilar, but what

else?
MR. HELLMAN:

Sure.

Sure.

Aguilar,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
69
1

and if you look at the jury instructions in

2

cases that have interpreted other obstruction

3

statutes that apply to proceedings, which is

4

never a defined term in those statutes, I don't

5

have a case name for you, you'll see that they

6

start to look like things like an audit where

7

you have an individualized assessment or

8

enforcement of some obligation enforceable by a

9

subpoena power.

10

Thank you.
