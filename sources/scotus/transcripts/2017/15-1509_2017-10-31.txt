JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What is the legal

standard?
MR. CROSS:

The legal standard should

23

be de novo -- the legal standard as articulated

24

by the Ninth Circuit was a two-prong test:

25

whether the parties' relationship was

Well, the test that we

You can, for example, have a close

21

relationship and have an intent to transact

22

with a party, but you can nevertheless purchase

24

That would be an arm's length transaction.

would not qualify for insider status.

That's exactly right.

The Jones -- the -- the Court's

20

approach to treat -- to defining seamen under

21

the Jones Act is right on point for this case.

22

You know, there, as here, there's no definition

23

of seaman, there's no definition of what is a

24

25

there, as here, the definition of insider and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

7
1

the definition of seaman require the

2

application of facts.

3

But in those cases, the Court has

4

drawn a distinction between clear error review

5

attached to historical findings of fact made by

6

the trial judge and de novo review with respect

7

to the guidelines and principle for the

8

application of the statute.

9

If you look at McDermott, for example,

10

it was the appropriate function of the trial

11

court to determine that the individual was a

12

painter and that he was a member of the crew.

13

But through the exercise of de novo review, the

14

Court said you do not need to aid in navigation

15

to qualify for seaman status.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it sounds

17

to me like you're taking the position that it

18

is a mixed question, which means it has

19

elements of both, but the standard of review -­

20

review should turn on which element the Court

21

is addressing.

22

both parties to the case agree, yes, this is

23

the standard of review, we agree, it's well

24

settled, but the facts apply in different ways.

25

In other words, you can have

Isn't that the factual part of the

4

Roberts, the factual portions, which are the

underlying historical facts made by the trial

12

it that they deal with each other as if they

were strangers?

14

Isn't that the definition?

That's the subsidiary

15

test, Your Honor.

And if -- and if arm's

16

length was so settled, it would not need a

17

subsidiary test.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- if you take two

different kinds of opinions.

One says the test

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1

is an arm's length transaction.

2

following considerations that we think should

3

be applied in determining whether something is

4

an arm's-length transaction.

5

Here are the

And the second opinion says the test

6

is arm's length transaction, doesn't talk about

7

considerations or factors, just assumes that

8

everybody knows what that arm's length is, and

9

just says here are the facts in this case and

10

then reaches a conclusion, well, this either is

11

or isn't an arm's length transaction.

12

Now, it seems to me that on the first

13

case you would have a good reason for saying:

14

Well, when the court tries to elaborate a test

15

and considers factors and considerations, those

16

things are more a part of the legal inquiry.

17

But when the court just says here is

18

our test, now here is the facts, and then

19

reaches a conclusion, it seems like all of

20

those facts, they're just facts.

21

MR. CROSS:

Your Honor, that -- your

22

second -- your second example would be more

23

reflective of trial courts finding arm's length

24

as a matter of fact.

25

remember here we're not solving for arm's

But it is important to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

length.

2

the arm's length is just a measure to determine

3

insider status.

4

We're solving for insider status.

And there could be great clarification

5

given to what that measure is.

6

four principles that would give greater

7

definition to what arm's length means.

8
9

And

JUSTICE ALITO:

We could have

Well, I think you're

talking about two separate questions.

And it's

10

not your fault that the two are hard to

11

separate because we took one question and we

12

didn't take the other.

13

But the issue here is what is the

14

standard of appellate review with respect to

15

the standard that was applied by the Ninth

16

Circuit.

17

the Ninth Circuit standard has two components.

18

One is whether it was an arm's length

19

transaction.

I take it that is the question.

And

20

And if the definition of an arm's

21

length transaction is the one that Justice

22

Ginsburg mentioned, which I think comes right

23

out of Black's Law Dictionary, is it the kind

24

of transaction in which strangers would engage?

25

Isn't that a -- a question of fact?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

Isn't that very close to a question of pure

2

fact?

3

MR. CROSS:

The -- the underlying

4

components of the test are questions of fact,

5

how did they engage?

6

this case, the trial court, it was a question

7

of fact that there was no negotiation.

8

a question of fact that they didn't -- that

9

there was no due diligence.

10

So for the trial -- in

Those were questions of fact.

It was

The

11

question for the appellate court and the

12

question that this case presents is what

13

standard of review should have been applied to

14

determine whether those facts satisfied the

15

statutory measure so that this was -- so that

16

this -- so that these litigants were

17

non-statutory insiders.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It -- it's more

19

blunt than that, because the lower court said

20

that there was diligence appropriate to the

21

amount of the investment.

22

like a factual finding, which is:

23

under the circumstances.

24
25

MR. CROSS:

So that does sound
it was due

The lower court in this

instance, Your Honor, made no determination

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

with respect to whether the parties negotiated

2

at arm's length, never mentioned -- never

3

mentioned arm's length, never mentioned if the

4

parties negotiated as strangers.

5

It just made the comment that it was

6

the appropriate due diligence for an investment

7

of $5,000, which in this case was none.

8
9

This -- this individual had never seen
the property, had -- knew nothing about the

10

bankruptcy case, paid $5,000 for a $2.7 million

11

claim.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You -- you have an

13

awful lot of strong arguments in this case on

14

the facts, but it still doesn't answer why this

15

is not a finding of fact as opposed to a

16

conclusion of law, because when he says this

17

was diligence enough for a $5,000 investment,

18

to me, that sounds like a quintessential fact

finding.

MR. CROSS:

of the Bankruptcy Code than determining who is

5

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Which entity -- which

16

entity is better positioned based on role and

17

experience to determine whether a particular

18

transaction is the kind of transaction in which

19

strangers would engage, the bankruptcy judge or

MR. CROSS:

I believe that the

whether the parties' relationship is

sufficiently close that the relationship is

14

over the weekend, and in Chandris, Justice

15

O'Connor writing for the Court was reviewing 50

16

years of history in determining the Seaman Act

17

the absence of definition and clarity, the

absence of giving general principles had led

the lower courts to create a labyrinth and they

had gotten lost in it.

practitioner, there is no greater safeguard

Yes.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

Now,

let's say that the determination turns, not

MR. CROSS:

The predicate facts to

of what is a domicile would be something that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I agree

with you that they're difficult, but I think

11

it's pertinent whether they're more difficult

12

for the district judge or more difficult for

13

the court of appeals.

14

And it seems to me that a lot of the

issues we're talking about here are the sort of

things that district court judges, bankruptcy

MR. CROSS:

I'm not suggesting that

a two -- two-year romantic relationship or

whether or not there was any due diligence.

4

I'm suggesting it was for the appellate court,

5

through the exercise of de novo review, to say

6

whether the existence of that romantic

relationship was important or whether the

exercise of due diligence was important.

was, that her status be -- can't be removed,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Why wouldn't we say what

are tests that we think are better formulated

at a certain level of generality.

means and how it applies in particular

MR. GEYSER:

Well, Your Honor, we

13

think if -- if the challenge is to the legal

14

standard, then it is a question of law, and

15

it's reviewed de novo, which is exactly what

16

the Ninth Circuit said and did in this case.

17

And if you look at page 17A of the

18

petition appendix in footnote 15, it said that

19

the bankruptcy court applied the arm's length

20

test.

21

why the transaction was at arm's length.

22

it described the standard in exactly the way

23

that my friend has and the way that Justice

the transaction arose as if it were between

review, not for challenging the legal

what's happening here, it's -- it's a legal

25

question that has to be broken into its

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

constituent parts.

2

look to -- to the Ninth Circuit decision to

3

have guidance here, what is the guiding legal

4

standard?

5

One question, and you would

And that is it -- that is as simple as

6

is it an arm's length transaction, did the

7

parties conduct this in the ordinary course of

8

business in good faith, exercising their own

9

independent judgment?

What was their

10

motivation for the transaction?

11

That's the legal test.

12

That's

reviewed de novo.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, it's not really

14

the legal test according to the Ninth Circuit,

15

right?

16

the arm's length component of its legal test,

17

but it also has this question whether the

18

closeness of the relationship with the debtor

19

is comparable to that of the enumerated insider

20

classifications in the statute.

Because the -- the Ninth Circuit has

21

And -- and how any particular set of

22

facts does or does not meet that prong of the

23

test does not seem much of a factual question.

24

MR. GEYSER:

Well, Your Honor, I -­

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, assume a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
36
1

particular set of facts that everybody agrees

2

to.

3

sufficiently close that it's comparable to the

4

enumerated insider classifications?

5
6
7

And then the question is:

Well, is that

That doesn't seem like any factual
question I've ever heard of.
MR. GEYSER:

Well, I -- I think it has

8

-- has a serious factual component, and

9

actually I would submit that it is still a

10

factual question because the statutory

11

enumerated categories create a yardstick.

12

the benchmark.

13

It's

And then the factual question for the

14

Court is looking at the -- the multifarious

15

fleeting special narrow circumstances that

16

arise in all the different cases, does this

17

particular transaction between these, these two

18

people, given their relationships, the nature

19

of the transaction, how well they knew each

20

other, how much negotiation took place, do they

21

look about as close as you find in the statute?

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if Bartlett and

23

Rabkin were married, then he would be a

24

statutory insider, would he not?

25

MR. GEYSER:

He -- he would.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
37
1

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

So -­

2

because he would be a relative, and a relative

3

is defined as somebody within the third degree

4

of consanguinity.

5

this from the bar review, but I looked it up,

6

and the third degree of consanguinity includes

7

grandparents-in-law, brother and sister-in-law,

8

grandchild-in-law.

And I doubt that I remember

9

Now, how does that square with the

10

test that the Ninth Circuit seems to -- I'm

11

sorry, that the bankruptcy court seems to have

12

applied here?

13

they share finances?

14

MR. GEYSER:

Did they live together?

Did

Well, what -- what the

15

bankruptcy court did, to be very clear, is they

16

engaged in a totality of the circumstances

17

finding, which is exactly what the controlling

18

standard requires.

19

It's fact-intensive.

So whether they lived together and did

20

they share finances, those are certain

21

considerations.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean, they weren't

23

as close -- they were not at least as close as

a brother or sister-in-law?

25

MR. GEYSER:

The -- not according to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
38
1

the -- to the bankruptcy court, but, again,

2

too, that's only one component of a totality

3

analysis.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

I -- I mean, if that's

5

the kind of determination you think we

6

should -- that should be deferred to under the

7

clear error standard, that's not a very good

8

example, is it?

9

MR. GEYSER:

Well, Your Honor, I think

10

that if -- if the Court is concerned that there

11

are -- there are certain degrees of closeness

12

that need a categorical rule that binds all

13

cases, then that would be a challenge to the

14

legal standard.

15

It would say that as a matter of

16

looking at the prong, whether the -- in

17

conducting a totality analysis, as to whether

18

parties are sufficiently close, courts should

19

take into account certain types of

20

characteristics.

21

I still would submit that that

22

ultimately is a factual determination, and it's

23

highly fact-intensive.

24
25

But even if you disagree and you think
this is more like a mixed question, that you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
39
1

need to define the legal standard and need to

2

apply it to the facts of this case, under this

3

Court's functional approach, asking which

4

judicial actor is better positioned to decide

5

these questions, we think the factors weigh

6

overwhelmingly in favor of clear error review.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why -- why is that

8

true?

Because I have certainly heard it said,

9

as your opponent said in answer to my question,

10

that bankruptcy judges have a very strong

11

tendency to want to get plans confirmed and to

12

do what is necessary to get plans confirmed.

13

And maybe in the heat of that, trying

14

to make sure that the plan can be confirmed,

15

and it doesn't have to preside over a

16

liquidation, there is a tendency to stretch

17

things, as certainly -- I mean, Judge Clifton's

18

opinion in this case is pretty strong that this

19

was -- this was -- at least that this was clear

20

error.

21

What do you say to that?

22

Counsel, could we

off this morning?

19

that oftentimes insider status is determined on

20

the basis of the closeness of the relationship

21

without respect to the arm's length nature of

22

the transaction, that that's just presumed.

23

And that was she pointed out

The Ninth Circuit has developed this

24

two-part test, and near as I can tell, it's

25

conjunctive.

You require both closeness and

lack of arm's length.

2

Other circuits have different verbal

formulations and some haven't even weighed in.

Some haven't even weighed in on the question

5

whether there is such thing as a non-statutory

insider.

Right?
And yet here we're being asked to

decide what the right standard of review is.
Can we do that with any degree of

10

assurance when we don't know what the right

11

legal test is?

12

risk, perhaps, of sending the wrong signal to

13

lower courts that we're adopting the Ninth

14

Circuit or endorsing the Ninth Circuit's

15

formulation of what the test is?

16

And -- and don't we run the

MR. GEYSER:

Well, Your Honor, I -- I

17

think a couple different points to that.

18

first is there is some degree of difficulty of

19

measuring between two points without knowing

20

what one of the points is, but -­

21

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

The

This seems to me a

22

high degree of difficulty.

23

those high dives, you know, it's a -- it's a 10

24

out of 10 difficulty.

25

MR. GEYSER:

It's like one of

Maybe.

But I -- I think

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
42
1

to give you a little bit of comfort, every

2

court of appeals that has addressed this

3

question has effectively adopted the arm's

4

length test.

5

And -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, you know, I

6

went and I had a law clerk survey that for me

7

and I've looked at it and I'm not sure I

8

entirely agree.

9

So help -- give me some comfort on

10

that, because I look at like the Fourth

11

Circuit, for example, and they talk about

12

sufficient authority.

13

really focused on the closeness aspect of it.

14

And then I look at others and they focus more

15

on the arm's length.

16

A closeness, they're

And I agree those are two important

17

factors, but the degree of attention given

18

really does seem very different across the

19

circuits.

20

MR. GEYSER:

Well, Your Honor, I think

21

ultimately, though, the circuits have looked at

22

this, and this includes Collier's conclusion,

23

surveying all the -- the relevant authority.

24

And as the expert bankruptcy treatise, they've

25

said that the transaction -- the test

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

ultimately does turn on whether it's an arm's

2

length transaction.

3

And -- and I -­

4

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

5

on closeness then?

6
7

MR. GEYSER:

Closeness is -- is a

factor -­

8
9

So it doesn't turn

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So we're not sure

about that?

10

MR. GEYSER:

Well, closeness is a

11

factor that weighs into the totality analysis.

12

But -­

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

The totality

14

analysis of the arm's length?

15

MR. GEYSER:

Totality -- you look at

16

the totality of the circumstances, so that

17

whether the parties are close is one factor

18

that courts take into account in weighing the

19

entire evidentiary record, which I think,

20

again, points up to why this is a particularly

21

--

22

So the test isn't

closeness or arm's length; it's totality?

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

11

That's -- that's again

So it's arm's

But that's not what

the Ninth Circuit says.
MR. GEYSER:

The Ninth Circuit said

that two factors count, but it ultimately -­

12

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

13

MR. GEYSER:

Both.

It said both.

But if you

14

read the opinion, our -- our reading of the

15

opinion is consistent with its view of how the

16

Seventh Circuit approaches this and the Tenth

17

Circuit, which is that the ultimate question is

18

whether the parties conducted the transaction

19

in the ordinary course of business, taking into

20

account their own independent commercial

21

motivations.

22
23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So closeness is

irrelevant?

24

MR. GEYSER:

Well, no, close -­

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's just whether

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

it's arm's length and the lack of arm's length

2

defines closeness?

3

MR. GEYSER:

Your Honor, closeness,

4

again, is -- is something that courts look at

5

to determine if a transaction is at arm's

6

length.

7

The parties -­
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Should we wait to

8

see what the courts of appeals sort out on all

9

this before we decide what the standard of

10

review is?

11

MR. GEYSER:

Your Honor, if the Court

12

would like to dismiss the case as improvidently

13

granted, we'll take a win any way we can get

14

it.

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. GEYSER:

But we -- we -- we do

17

think, though, that the -- I think any standard

18

that the courts adopt will still require clear

19

error review because even if you think the

20

standard has sufficient legal norms embedded

21

within it, it still will ask appellate judges

22

to take the time-consuming and inefficient task

23

of reweighing and re-evaluating facts and -­

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I suppose that

we could articulate what the right answer is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
46
1

based on a particular understanding of the

2

test, and I gather there's little dispute about

3

that.

4

We certainly can determine exactly

5

what we're looking at and then make it clear

6

and send it back.

7

its test is something else, then that'll be -­

8

they'll be free to apply the facts under the

9

appropriate standard of that test.

10

If the Ninth Circuit thinks

MR. GEYSER:

Your Honor, I think,

11

though, if -- if the Court were to remand to -­

12

to reconsider under a different test, I think

13

that would actually be deciding what the test

14

is to some extent.

15

But, again, I think as for the

16

standard of review, the Ninth Circuit did apply

17

de novo review to the understanding of the

18

legal test, so the definition of the test it

19

clearly said is a purely legal inquiry and it

20

applied de novo review in reviewing the

21

bankruptcy court's decision.

22

The -- the question before the Court

23

right now is, is it appropriate to have two

24

rounds of appellate review?

25

the five circuits that have bankruptcy

And, again, for

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
47
1

appellate panels, you have six appellate judges

2

being asked to take a highly multifarious,

3

fleeting, special narrow fact -- factual record

4

and re-evaluating a factual determination -­

5
6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
something -­

7
8

But you know

MR. GEYSER:

-- that a bankruptcy

judge made.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

shouldn't be a pass.

11

some of them are clear.

12

-- clear error

There are errors.

And

And so why isn't this one of those

13

cases?

14

which is on these facts you can't sustain a

15

finding of arm's length transaction or a

16

finding that there was a lack of closeness.

17

That's what Judge Clifton was saying,

That -- so even under that standard,

18

there has to be some meaning to what those two

19

things mean and some explanation as to why that

20

-- this fits that.

21
22

MR. GEYSER:

Sure, Your Honor.

you may think -­

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24

MR. GEYSER:

25

And

What else?

-- that that -- well,

that is a fact-bound case-specific

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
48
1

determination as to whether the Ninth Circuit

2

correctly applied clear error review in this

3

case.

4

Court is whether it should have applied clear

5

error review or something else.

6

And, again, the question before the

Now we respectfully disagree with

7

Judge Clifton's conclusion.

We think that if

8

you look to the facts, as the bankruptcy court

9

found them, the -- this was a negotiated

10

transaction.

11

the debtor and asked for more money after he

12

determined that his claim was worth more, which

13

is what independent parties do.

14

Dr. Rabkin went back to the -- to

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

He -­

No, they go into a

15

bidding war.

I would have been the very first

16

one going back and forth and saying who's going

17

to pay me the highest amount?

18

MR. GEYSER:

Well, but he -- what he

19

concluded, though, is that this -- this is a

20

$5,000 transaction that he made.

21

perfectly reasonable for someone who is a

22

sophisticated, wealthy investor to decide that

23

additional bidding and additional negotiation

24

just simply isn't worth his time.

25

And so it's

But, again, the relevant question

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
49
1

before the Court is whether clear error review,

2

in fact, applies.

3

And -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What do we do with

4

-- with -- the bankruptcy court's take on this

5

case was, I think, the right standard, is to

6

see -- to say was this an insider, was -- what

7

is her name -- Bartlett an insider?

8
9
10
11
12
13

The answer is that, yes, that when she
transfers her claim, the insider taint travels
with it.
Is there any split on that question?
We didn't take it, but -­
MR. GEYSER:

There is not a split on

14

that question, Your Honor.

15

look at this has understood that whether

16

someone is an insider is a -- is a

17

determination about the character of the person

18

as opposed to a characteristic of the claim

19

that they acquired.

20

Every circuit to

And I think that the -- the easiest

21

way to understand why the Ninth Circuit's

22

determination on that point was correct is if

23

this claim had been acquired at, you know, an

24

anonymous auction, surely it wouldn't matter

25

that the claim had originated with a -- with a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
50
1
2

statutory insider.
But, again, that -- that is a question

3

that the Court did not agree to review.

4

looking at the other factors that this Court

5

takes into account in looking at which judicial

6

actor has the better institutional capacity to

7

decide the question, it also considers the -­

8

the cost of the appellate court to recreate the

9

factual determination.

10

And

It looks to the cost to the parties to

11

have to litigate multiple rounds of -- of

12

review on a highly fact-intensive question.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well -- well, you're

14

assuming that it's not cost-effective for

15

courts over a period of time to elaborate

certain standards for the guidance of district

way the system works.

MR. GEYSER:

That's not the

the relevant issue being challenged -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You say:

Oh, that's

inefficient, we might as well just let
everybody do everything they want every time.
MR. GEYSER:

Well, no.

To be

12

perfectly clear, if the relevant challenge -­

13

again, you have to break it into its

14

constituent parts -- is to the -- the norm

15

being applied or to the legal definition of the

16

standard, that is a question of law for the

17

Court, as the Ninth Circuit held.

18

If the question is whether the facts

19

of this case satisfy that legal standard,

20

that's a factual determination and -- or maybe

21

a mixed question, but that's still a highly

22

fact-intensive process that is not really

23

falling within the, you know, the heartland of

24

what appellate courts typically do.

25

And this Court didn't find concerns

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
52
1

about losing law-clarifying benefits to control

2

in -- in Highmark where it decided, you know,

3

exceptional cases under the Patent Act or in

4

issuing subpoenas in McLane or in looking at

5

exceptional case findings or -- or other

6

questions in Pierce, that there are lots of

decisions that look in balance at the -- the -­

8

the comparative advantages of appellate courts

deciding things that are inherently factual and

10

trial courts that have expertise in doing

11

exactly what they're doing here.

12

And that's even if the -- the

13

documentary record is established.

Trial

14

judges are very good at taking a whole

15

collection of facts and evidence, an entire

16

record and weighing components against each

other.

here, it involves questions of motivation and

intent.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Once all the facts are

established, why is it preferable for a

bankruptcy judge as opposed to a court of

make the person in question comparable to a

statutory insider?

8
9

MR. GEYSER:

I -- I think even if the

facts are established, it still requires

10

reweighing and balancing all of those facts,

11

which is something that -- that trial judges do

12

very well and appellate judges don't do quite

13

as well.

14

And it distracts from the appellate

15

court's work in addressing the true legal

16

standards when parties are actually challenging

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But -­

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

But appeals are not

4

always a bad thing.
MR. GEYSER:

Oh, certainly not.

5

And -- and, again, if it's a challenge to the

6

legal standard, then it -- it makes good sense

7

to have de novo review.

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

But one way of

thinking of this is that once you have the

10

facts and the facts are uncontested and you're

11

trying to figure out whether those facts

12

satisfy a given legal standard, here whether

13

they are comparably close to the statutory

14

insiders, that then -- what the court is then

15

doing is trying to figure out how important

16

each fact is, given the legal test.

17

And that sounds like a legal inquiry

18

to me or a -- or, you know, how important is

19

this fact in terms of what we should be looking

20

to, in terms of what the legal test is.

21
22
23

MR. GEYSER:

Well, Your Honor, I -- I

disagree, and this is why.
The courts are looking to determine if

24

the parties really were acting as if they were

25

strangers to the transaction and that really

be more important than others.

are highly fact-intensive.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MORGAN GOODSPEED

2

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

3

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

4
5

MS. GOODSPEED:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

6

At this point, everyone agrees that

7

questions of statutory construction are

8

reviewed de novo and basic historical facts are

9

reviewed for clear error.

So the -- the debate

10

this morning is about how do we understand the

11

bankruptcy court's finding here that two

12

parties operated at arm's length.

13

The government's position is not that

14

because that is the test, that automatically is

15

reviewed for clear error, as Petitioner

16

suggests.

17

because this is the type of test that is well

18

established and is familiar and is asking for a

19

pure factual inference, that is -- that finding

20

that comes from that test will be reviewed for

21

clear error.

22

The government's position is that,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But that seems easier

23

to say about the arm's length part of the test

24

than about the sufficiently close to a

25

statutory insider part.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
57
1

MS. GOODSPEED:

So that's correct,

2

Justice Kagan.

3

general matter as Respondents' counsel

4

suggested, how closeness is defined is so close

5

that you're not operating at arm's length.

6

That's how the court of appeals understood it

7

at page 14 of the petition appendix and again

8

at page 17 of the petition appendix.

9

Two things:

first, as a

And so, if closeness ultimately just

10

gets folded into the arm's length calculus,

11

then "was this transaction at arm's length" is

12

going to be the ultimate determination in the

13

case.

14

leading bankruptcy court treatise discusses it.

15

That's consistent with how the parties argued

16

this case.

17

And that's consistent with how the

And so I do think that the result of

18

that is that even if there might be more

19

legal-sounding questions with respect to

20

closeness, it's not really an independent prong

21

of the test so much as folding into it.

22

The arm's length test itself is

23

comparable in some ways to this Court's

24

decision in Commissioner versus Duberstein, and

25

that case dealt with what is a gift for

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
58
1

purposes of the Tax Code?

2

you know, that's not a pure intent question,

3

but it is essentially a factual inference drawn

4

from all of the other facts.

5

And this Court said,

What we're trying to get at is, what

6

is the dominant motive for how these parties

7

are interacting?

8

factual inference, and it's going to be

9

reviewed for clear error.

10

And that's going to be a

We think the same

thing applies here.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Does the government

12

have a position on the -- that we're dealing

13

with a cramdown safeguard.

14

MS. GOODSPEED:

That's correct.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the bankruptcy

16

judge that everybody is praising as having the

17

best insight thought the test ought to be is

18

the seller an insider and the -- the taint

19

travels with the claim.

20

have a position on what is the right answer to

21

that?

22

MS. GOODSPEED:

Does the government

Yes.

So, at the cert

23

stage, we agreed with Respondents that what

24

matters for purposes of insider status is the

25

claimant rather than the claim.

So it's an

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
59
1

individual or an entity that is an insider, not

2

a claim that has an insider status that travels

3

with it.

4

With respect to the bankruptcy court's

5

competence here, we are not arguing, as I think

6

some of these questions have alluded to

7

earlier, that the bankruptcy court gets to

8

define the legal rules, that if there were a

9

creation of some multi-factor test for defining

10

when something is at arm's length, we agree

11

that that would be a legal question reviewed de

12

novo.

13

But the important thing is that in

14

this particular case, the question that

15

received clear error review was the question of

16

what, at the end of the day, was Dr. Rabkin

17

trying to do here?

18

The majority said this was a

19

speculative investment, or at least it could

20

have been a speculative investment.

21

dissent said this was a clear favor to a

22

friend.

23

that fight about whether under all of the facts

Dr. Rabkin should be viewed as having acted in

not an arm's length transaction is more

11

objective in character.

12

still carry the day?

13

MS. GOODSPEED:

Would your argument

Well, we don't

14

disagree that what is or is not an arm's length

15

transaction can actually be more objective.

16

When we're talking about intent, we mean the

17

same way the Court used it in Duberstein, which

18

is to say this isn't a pure subjective

19

question, but the ultimate goal of the test is

20

to get at what is driving these parties, and so

21

the goal in establishing an arm's length

22

transaction is, is this person commercially

23

disinterested, acting like a stranger, or is

24

this person operating under a conflict of

25

interest?

That's the more -­

that could or could not be.

May -- may I ask

He didn't know what the return on

How come it's an arm's length

transaction if the only way he makes his money

7

back is voting for the cramdown plan?

8

doesn't he -- isn't he self-interested by

9

definition when he's buying something that

10

Meaning,

depends totally on him voting with the company?

11

MS. GOODSPEED:

Well -­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because he doesn't

13

get paid at all if he doesn't vote for -- with

14

the company's cramdown.

15

MS. GOODSPEED:

16

Sotomayor, that may be possible.

17

thought could be, for example, there could be

18

another plan where he would receive more money

19

or he could buy this claim for $5,000 and sell

20

it to Petitioner for even more money.

21

there were other possibilities other than

22

voting for this particular plan.

23

Sure, Justice
I guess the

And so

But I do want to say that type of

24

argument could be an argument for why there may

25

have been clear error here or why this should

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
62
1

have been considered an arm's-length

2

transaction in the first instance.

3

And the government isn't taking a

4

position on whether there was or was not clear

5

error here.

6

I think -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Whether somebody is a

7

-- is an insider seems to be a question of

8

status, whether it's a statutory insider or a

9

non-statutory insider.

So, how do you get from

10

a question of status to a question that

11

examines the particulars of a particular -- of

12

a transaction and the motivation and the

13

relationship between the parties?

14

MS. GOODSPEED:

Sure, Justice Alito.

15

I -- that has been how courts have interpreted

16

this.

17

to do is apply an ejusdem generis canon to the

18

statute and say what is the concern with all of

19

these listed entities?

20

all of them is that they're going to operate

21

under some sort of conflict of interest and not

22

interact with the debtor in the way that a

23

neutral person would.

24

courts have extracted this arm's-length test

25

from that -­

I think what they've essentially tried

And the concern with

at -­
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But isn't Justice

5

Sotomayor correct that in a lot of areas we

6

presume that based on the status of the

7

individual involved or the relationship and we

8

don't make an inquiry into the nature of the

9

transaction at all?

10

MS. GOODSPEED:

That's exactly

11

correct, and that would be correct if someone

12

were listed in the statute.

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

14

MS. GOODSPEED:

15

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So why -­
But I -­
So why couldn't that

16

also be a possible test for those who aren't

17

listed in the statute, assuming such a class of

18

persons exists?

MS. GOODSPEED:

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

21
22

Sure.

I -­

Which we haven't

decided either, right?
MS. GOODSPEED:

Yes.

I mean, the way

23

that courts have looked at this is by

24

extracting a principle versus trying to

25

establish other categories.

That's just the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64

general rule.

2

I think maybe an explanation for that

3

is that Congress drew these bright lines in the

4

statutes and that it's somewhat more difficult

5

for courts to draw the same kind of bright

6

lines for things like friendships or romantic

Would it -­

Would it be nice to

11

resolve that question first before deciding

12

what the standard of review is?

13

government's brief, I think, admirably points

14

out, and I couldn't agree more, that

15

determining the "standard of review thus

16

requires precise identification of the

17

particular question raised on appeal."

18

MS. GOODSPEED:

I mean, the

Yes, Justice Gorsuch.

19

In that sense, we do think the Court can still

This Court hasn't

resolved that, but, again, what it can look to

12

is what the court of appeals actually decided

here.

14

as illustrated by the difference between the

15

majority and the dissent is, was this an

16

arm's-length transaction, was Dr. Rabkin acting

17

as a commercial stranger, or was he clearly

18

doing a favor to a friend?

Does -- does the

transaction was done at arm's length?

MS. GOODSPEED:

So -- so I would

bookmark the possibility that courts could say

you are sort of, in fact, one of -- in the

listed categories, you are, in fact, a married

couple, even if you are not formally given that

title.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11

Thank you,

MR. CROSS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:

12

Justice Gorsuch, I'd like to come to

13

your point.

The test -- what we're solving for

14

is who does and does not satisfy insider status

15

under the Bankruptcy Code.

16

that the Court should have applied de novo

17

review to.

That's the question

18

The Ninth Circuit chose its test, but

19

if it was going to choose that test, it should

20

have applied through to exercise a de novo

21

review.

22

We're not solving necessarily for

23

arm's length for closeness, although that's the

24

test that the court enunciated.

25

was the test the court enunciated, it should

question.

5

And you think the

And -- and we didn't take that

That's on us.
MR. CROSS:

I think the test is

6

inadequate.

7

affirm without applying de novo review, you

8

perpetuate the inadequacy.

9

And I think that if you -- if you

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Should -- should we

10

even attempt to answer the question, though,

11

without -- of the standard of review without

12

first defining, as the -- as the government put

13

it, the "precise identification of the

14

particular question raised on appeal?"

15

MR. CROSS:

Absolutely.

I mean, in

16

every instance when this Court's looked at a

17

statute and applied the facts to the statute,

18

it applies de novo review.

19
20
21

The alternative is to abdicate that
rule -­
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So you don't care.

22

Whatever the test is, is always going to be de

23

MR. CROSS:

It has to be de novo -­

Now what happened here is we allowed,

15

through the absence of de novo review, the

16

bankruptcy court to develop its own test.

18

circumstances here.

19

The

The bankruptcy court went out,

20

surveyed the other courts and said these five

21

factors are determinative of insider status.

22

That's what occurred.

23

Now, in Miller, I don't usually read

24

quotes, but I think this quote is right on.

25

Miller, the Court wrote, "When relevant legal

Heritage Reporting Corporation

In

principles can be given meaning through the

2

application of particular circumstances of a

3

case, the Court has been reluctant to give the

4

trier of fact's conclusions presumptive force

5

and, in so doing, stripped the federal court of

6

its primary function as an expositor of the

7

law."

8

did here.

That's exactly what the appellate court

9

It abdicated its responsibility to

10

enunciate clear standards and to give meaning

11

to the insider status by the exercise of clear

12

error review.

13

de novo review.

14
15

If there are no further questions,
I'll submit the case.
